<HEAD>Elvis Costumes Fetch Top Dollar at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stage costume worn by Elvis Presley sold
Wednesday at a rock'n'roll and film memorabilia auction for
$43,700, a record price for a piece of the late singer's clothing,
auctioneers said.
   Bidding was also fierce for another Presley costume, for a 1964
telegram from former Beatle Ringo Starr and for a four-foot wall
thermometer featuring Marilyn Monroe, officials said at Phillips
auction house.
   Warren Stone of the Hard Rock Cafe in Los Angeles bought
``Shooting Star,'' a suit Presley wore at a 1972 concert at Madison
Square Garden in New York, the auctioneers said. Hard Rock cafes
are decorated with rock music memorabilia.
   Commission costs raised the total purchase price of the costume
to $48,050, a Phillips statement said.
   Former country music singer Jimmy Velvet bought for $23,500 a
Presley stage suit nicknamed ``Good Luck'' by the singer and worn
on a 1972 tour of Hawaii.
   ``This makes six jump suits which were once worn by Elvis which
I now own,'' said Velvet, who plans to exhibit the outfit at an
Elvis Presley museum he runs in Nashville, Tenn.
   The costumes were the highlights of 550 items on sale, said
Wendell Milton, rock and pop memorabilia specialist for the London
auction house.
   ``They very rarely come up for auction,'' said Milton. ``Most of
them are in Graceland,'' the Nashville mansion Presley owned before
his death in 1977. It now is a museum.
   Former Beatle drummer Starr sent his telegram to a Dutch
newspaper to apologize for pulling out of a Beatles tour of Holland
because of tonsillitis.
   ``I'm very sorry I couldn't come to Holland and hope to see all
my Dutch fans on the next trip. Ringo Starr,'' it said.
   It had been expected to fetch $336. But Stone bid against Brian
Murphy of London's Hard Rock Cafe and won with an offer of $3,000.
   ``I bought it because I liked it,'' Stone said. ``I know it was
a lot to pay.''
   Stone estimated he spent about $74,000 at Wednesday's auction.
He said he will exhibit all his purchases.
   A private collector paid $7,700 for the bright-orange
thermometer featuring Marilyn Monroe to promote her 1959 film
``Some Like It Hot.'' The collector was not identified.
   Phillips said it had been expected to sell for $1,340.
   ``I think people go crazy for anything to do with Marilyn
Monroe,'' Milton said. ``She's so in vogue right now.''
   Milton said the auction raised $287,300, but had its
disappointments _ including handwritten lyrics by Bruce Springsteen
and stage clothing worn by Michael Jackson.
   Six sets of singer and guitarist Springsteen's lyrics were
offered for auction, but only two lyric sheets for the songs ``I've
Got A Fever'' and ``Cancel My Tomorrows,'' found buyers, Milton
said.
   A shirt Michael Jackson wore at the Jackson Brothers' first
concert after the group left the Motown label in 1976 sold for
$1,680, about half the estimate, he said.
   Four glittery stage suits worn by the Osmond Brothers on their
1975 European tour sold for a total of $4,370. Each suit was marked
with the name of the brother who owned it: Donny, Merrill, Alan and
Jay.

   Security police arrested three Swedes
suspected of spying for an East European country, national Swedish
television reported Wednesday.
   The two men and a woman were detained Tuesday in the
southwestern port city of Goteborg and Chief Public Prosecutor
Sven-Olof Hakansson will ask a court Thursday to arraigned them,
the report said.
   ``It concerns military secrets, but I can't say of which
country,'' the Swedish news agency TT quoted Hakansson as saying.
   The three suspects, originally from East European countries,
have not been conducting spying activities against Sweden but
against ``another country'', the television report said.
   The suspects, whose names were not released in accordance with
press regulations, were said to have worked for an unidentified
East European country.

   A face-off between demonstrators
supporting and opposing Oliver North resulted in a dozen arrests
Wednesday night outside a Republican fund-raiser where the
Iran-Contra defendant appeared.
   Twelve anti-North demonstrators were taken into custody for
disorderly conduct, Lt. Terry Martorano of the Waukesha County
Sheriff's Department said. He said two were also cited for
resisting arrest and one for possession of a controlled substance.
No injuries were reported
   By 10 p.m., most of those arrested were free on bail, he said,
adding that they would face court dates in about two weeks.
   Martorano said most of the arrests involved demonstrators who
were ``generally not adhering to rules set up out there for the
protesters to follow.'' Police required the anti-North
demonstrators to stay within a specific area preventing any
intermingling of the two protest groups.
   Reporters at the scene said there were about 125 anti-North
protesters and 60 pro-North demonstrators.
   Ardelle Hough of Madison, who described herself as an officer of
the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, contended
the police rules and the arrests violated the protesters'
constitutional rights of free speech and free assembly.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, retired earlier
this year as a lieutenant colonel after 20 years in the Marine
Corps. He was among four people named in an indictment sought by a
special prosecutor who investigated the sales of U.S. arms to Iran
and diversion of funds to aid rebels in Nicaragua.
   The protesters gathered outside the Waukesha Exposition Center
in the Town of Pewaukee where North was appearing at a fund-raiser
for former state Republican Party Chairman Steve King, who is
seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate.
   Hough said King is a former FBI agent with a national security
background.
   ``The issue isn't Ollie North,'' she said. ``The issue isn't
even George Bush. The issue is U.S. foreign policy, pushing around
all the rest of the people of the world.''

   A 3-pound Yorkshire terrier survived a
fall from a 12th-floor balcony and may be walking again by the end
of the week, a veterinarian says.
   ``It's really a lucky dog,'' said veterinarian Earl Johnson, who
treated the tan and black dog named Missy. ``I didn't think she was
going to make it, to tell you the truth ... it's a definite
miracle.''
   Doctors said Monday the dog had an 85 percent to 90 percent
chance of total recovery.
   Missy fell Friday from the penthouse balcony of the Sea Mark
Tower condominium.
   Her owners, Roy and Ann Gipson, said strong winds created a
vacuum that sucked the small dog through a 5-inch-wide opening in a
guard rail.
   Missy landed in a sandy area, just missing a brick walkway and
an air conditioner. A tree limb apparently helped break her fall.
   Missy was in shock with a broken leg when taken to an animal
hospital.

<TEXT>
   An American tourist accused of terrorism left
Peru for Shannon, Ireland, on Tuesday hours after she was released
from jail for the second time.
   Cynthia McNamara, 40, a native of Philadelphia, had been
imprisoned for nearly five months on charges of taking part in an
attack by guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement in which
two people were killed.
   A Lima court cleared her on April 26 but she was rearrested on
the same charges Aug. 2 and was held in jail until Monday night.
   The U.S. Embassy issued a brief statement Tuesday expressing
approval that she was released.
   But her departure entered a tense hour at Lima's international
airport when the embassy sent word that Peru was refusing to allow
her to travel anywhere but to the United States, her lawyers said.
   Attorney Jose Burneo said the embassy and former Lima Mayor
Alfonso Barrantes made phone calls to Peruvian officials ``at the
highest levels'' to gain final approval for her departure.
   About 20 friends and journalists witnessed her departure at 5:15
p.m. aboard a Soviet Aeroflot flight for Shannon.
   ``My name is cleared. I feel relieved,'' she said.
   Police first arrested her Dec. 5 in Ayacucho state, 225 miles
southeast of Lima, while she was on a trip through Peru and Chile
as a tourist.
   She was charged with taking part in a guerrilla attack in August
1987 in Vilcashuaman in Ayacucho in which two government employees
were slain.
   Ms. McNamara was released from jail after a Lima court cleared
her of the charges. Her attorneys and the U.S. Embassy said two
survivors of the Vilcashuaman attack testified she was not among
the assailants. Other witnesses said she was in Puquio, 90 miles
south of Vilcashuaman, when the attack occurred.
   Lima Superior Court upheld the ruling on July 13 and Ms.
McNamara began making arrangements to leave Peru.
   She was rearrested on an outstanding warrant stemming from the
Vilcashuaman attack when she appeared at a Lima police station on
Aug. 2 to get approval to depart.
   She spent the next three weeks in jail as her attorneys fought
to prevent her transfer to Cangallo, the province in Ayacucho state
where Vilcashuaman is located.
   Her release came after an Ayacucho court ruled Monday that she
could not be tried twice for the same crime, Burneo said.
   Ms. Mcnamara said she plans to go to London and meet friends
before seeking a job teaching English ``somewhere in Europe.''
   She reiterated her innocence to reporters Tuesday. She has
frequently disavowed any ties with the Shining Path.

<TEXT>
   Richard R. Green, head of New York City's
trouble-plagued schools for six months, faces the start of his
first full school year and has no glib, instant answers for
problems decades in the making.
   Asked in a lengthy interview what his chief accomplishments have
been so far, the former superintendent of Minneapolis's schools
answered without apology: ``None.''
   ``I didn't rush to judgment because I thought: Who are you to
come in, to be invited into somebody's home, and decide what's
wrong with the home? But I do believe I'm responsible starting this
school year,'' he said.
   For Green, whose quiet, methodical speech belies a steely core,
it's the little things, the symbols, that will lead to big changes.
   This month, for example, he conducted the first-ever count of
people working for the central board, a bureaucracy almost
legendary for its inscrutability. The answer: 6,447.
   Next, Green wanted to show teachers he really cares about their
professional status. He chose a symbol, giving each of the city's
974 schools until December to rid themselves of the time clocks
that teachers have had to punch.
   As for the biggest issues _ the dropout rate, the racial
polarization, the sorry state of education for the handicapped, the
taming of custodians who had grown all-powerful in many schools _
Green pleads with New Yorkers not to expect real solutions for
years.
   Here are highlights of the interview:
   Q: Now that six months have passed, do you ever wonder what
you've gotten yourself into? Are you surprised or shocked at what
you've found here?
   A: No. I think it's a very unusual and special opportunity to
affect the lives of nearly one million students. The common theme
throughout New York City, despite the dropout rate, despite the
fact that we have had students with weapons in school, is an
underlying feeling that we've got to make the schools work by
working together. And that's a very motivating thing for me.
   Q: What would you list as your key accomplishments so far?
   A: None. I haven't accomplished anything. I've come to set the
stage for making education work. I'm working toward ... making this
the most successful school year that New York City has had.
   Q: Let's talk about some of the toughest problems you'll face.
The city has handled education for the handicapped so badly that
it's been under federal court monitoring for a decade. When do you
think things will improve enough for that to end?
   A: Maybe five years. Anybody looking for an instant response to
that will be disappointed. There are too many complicating factors,
particularly the numbers of children who are non-English speaking.
   The reason litigation builds up over time is that there was a
loss of communication and trust. It's going to take time with those
advocacy groups and parent groups to restore the trust that was, or
create what never was.
   Q: The city's school minority population stands at over 80
percent. Only a handful of high schools have white enrollments
above 50 percent. Is racial integration now an impossible dream for
most of our schoolchildren?
   A: It seems to me we're a country very dependent on diversity, a
society that stands for access, not exception. The goals of
integration ought to be widely clung to ...
   The majority of students in this city, unless they are selected
by special schools, will very unlikely have the opportunity for an
integrated experience. Students cannot travel the long distances
required in this large and complex city. In order to have large
scale racial integration, you need large-scale racial balance in
New York City. You don't have it.
   Q: Let's talk about the status of school reform here in New
York. One idea you became famous for in Minneapolis was your
program of testing kindergarten children and holding back those who
flunk. You've raised the possibility of starting that in New York
City despite warnings by many educators that such testing is
inappropriate for children that age. Are you still pushing for this?
   A: What I have observed in American education in my nearly 30
years is that those systems relying on social promotion missed the
mark.
   I don't care if students are retained or not. What I care about
is that we know how well they are performing so that they don't
become victims of the system. If you don't have some process by
which ... a teacher you can look a parent in the eye and say,
you're child is really ready, you're almost rendering some children
to academic failure the rest of their life. The gap seems to be
particularly damaging for minority students, and minority males to
be specific.
   I'm prepared to continue our discussion. It really does not
matter to me that New York adopt the Minneapolis model about
retention. But teachers do have to be accountable for what they are
willing to recommend to the next level of teacher. Otherwise it's
not going to work.
   Q: You said in your inaugural address last March that schools
should stop making teachers punch time clocks. Will they still be
doing so in September?
   A: I said in my inaugural comments that I thought it was
unprofessional. Some people have replied, you can't trust anybody.
People see others not doing what they should, the guy next door who
went off to watch the Knicks or the Yankees. But I still say
they're professionals.
   So I am putting out a memo asking principals to work with their
staffs to determine how they can account for attendance in the
absence of time clocks, or whether they want to sustain them. They
will make the decision building-by-building, and no one will ever
be able to say they didn't have a chance to participate in a work
related issue that I think is symbolic.
   Q: Your style seems to be low-key, methodical, deliberate, in a
town that's brash and brassy. Do you worry that your lower profile
makes people wonder, what's this guy doing? Is that a problem in
this town?
   A: I have no idea. My mission, it may sound altruistic, is to
serve children. I hope to represent the school community in the
best possible way.
   My eye is on that prize. For those who want a daily performance
report, they're not going to find me a very willing participant. I
don't think it has anything with education. I don't think it has
anything to do with children.

<TEXT>
   The state Assembly Tuesday night gave final
legislative approval to a measure that would stiffen penalties for
those caught illegally dumping infectious medical wastes.
   The bill, which passed 142-0 without debate, also provides more
money for enforcement and needs only the signature of Gov. Mario
Cuomo to become law.
   It's designed to stem the flow of medical debris that washed
ashore on several New York City and Long Island beaches, closing
them to bathers on some of the hottest days of the year.
   The bill would provide penalties of up to 10 years in jail and
fines of $100,000 for people convicted of disposing of ``red bag''
wastes, so named because the waste is required to be thrown out in
specially marked containers.
   New York state will also provide $2 million to add new illegal
dumping patrols.
   State Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling
concluded last month that there was no single source for the waste
washing up on New York beaches. He said the waste may have come
through the New York City sanitation system, through illegal
dumping, casual dumping from boats or some combination of all of
these.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of exile and scorn
for the ballot box, El Salvador's leftist political parties allied
with Marxist-led guerrillas are preparing to compete in next year's
presidential election.
   ``Elections here between 1982 and now have been part of a plan
designed principally to counter action of the guerrilla army, part
of a counter-insurgency project,'' said Hector Oqueli, organization
secretary of the National Revolutionary Movement.
   ``It could therefore be argued that we are now lending our
support for that same project, and that we're contradicting
ourselves,'' he said.
   However, Oqueli added, more ``political space has opened up''
since the presidents of El Salvador and four other Central American
countries signed a peace plan Aug. 7, 1987.
   ``We want to take maximum advantage of that political opening,
even though we are certain that doing political work in those
spaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles,'' he said in
an interview in his party's San Salvador headquarters.
   The regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, but it has contributed to
broadening the range of political expression in El Salvador and
Nicaragua.
   The National Revolutionary Movement, as part of the Democratic
Revolutionary Front, has been allied since 1981 with the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla organization known
as the FMLN that has been fighting the U.S.-backed Salvadoran
government for eight years.
   Leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980s
because of rampant rightist death squads began returning to El
Salvador in November and are still coming.
   Among them are Guillermo Ungo, Oqueli and Ruben Zamora, general
secretary of the Popular Social Christian Movement.
   Zamora's party is a left-leaning offshoot of the centrist
Christian Democratic Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who
sat on military-civilian juntas in 1980-82 and has governed since
1984. Duarte has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal.
   The Oqueli's Revolutionay Movement, the Social Christians and
the Social Democratic Party have formed the Democratic Convergence.
Oqueli's group announced in July its participation, via the
Convergence, in the presidential election set for March. Although
the electoral front has yet to announce its participation
officially, it is already hard at work launching a campaign.
   Zamora, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the
Convergence's activity ``is generating a political alternative
capable of attracting ample sectors of the population that have
been left without alternative.''
   ``We're also contributing little by little to overcoming
people's fear, because of past repression, of participating in
politics,'' he said.
   The leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory.
   ``We are not taking part strictly for the votes, rather we're
mounting a historical project that transcends election day,'' said
Oqueli.
   The main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end to
the war. The government has rejected two such proposals by the
insurgents so far this year.
   ``The country's principal problem is the war,'' Oqueli said.
``If the armed conflict is not resolved, we will not be able to
resolve the economic, social and political problems _ health,
housing, nutrition, employment. So we're telling the Salvadoran
people that a solution to the war is necessary, and for us that
solution is a negotiated political one.''
   Duarte's position is that the guerrillas lay down their arms
before talks can begin, but the rebels say that would be tantamount
to surrender.
   The guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban during
legislative and municipal elections in March to underscore their
characterization of them as ``a farce.'' The prospect of watching
their political allies take part in similar elections next year is
thought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow.
   ``The FMLN doesn't have to either approve or disapprove of our
participation,'' said Oqueli. ``They simply must respect it, as we
respect their principal means of struggle.''
   He said political and military revolutionary leaders met in
Managua, Nicaragua, in mid-July to discuss electoral participation.
   ``Our position and our objectives were fully understood (by the
guerrillas.)'' he said.
   The Convergence will go up against an incumbent party shattered
by infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power during
years of crisis. Duarte's promises of peace and increased
well-being have gone unfulfilled.
   The Republican Nationalist Alliance, the main rightist
opposition, is running on the full head of steam produced by its
victories in March. The party, known as Arena, gained control of
the legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide.
   The leftist political front could face its most difficult
dilemma if no candidate in March receives more than 50 percent of
the vote. That would require a second round with the top two
finishers in the running.
   Most observers doubt either the Christian Democrats or Arena
will receive a majority in the first round.
   If the Convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote, which
is considered feasible, it could decide the outcome by casting its
lot with one of the two major parties.
   Oqueli said he believes abstention would be advisable in a
second round.
   ``If we tie ourselves to the Christian Democrats, and they
continue as they have been, we dirty our future,'' he said. ``And
Arena represents the oligarchic past that brought the country to
where it is now.''

   More than a month of demonstrations by an
anti-abortion group trying to close local clinics have worn out the
city's welcome mat, and Southern hospitality is being withdrawn.
   During and just after the Democratic National Convention, police
carried anti-abortion protesters to waiting jail buses. Now, more
than 700 arrests and a dozen demonstrations later, they drag them.
   ``We're giving them the opportunity to walk the 10 feet to the
bus,'' said police Sgt. Melvin Denson.
   ``We are no longer extending certain courtesies,'' says Sgt.
Carl Pydrum Jr.
   The jails are getting crowded, although corrections officials
say they can manage, even if some demonstrators have to bunk on
cell floors. And the cost of protecting the clinics and of
arresting and holding the protesters has shot past $250,000.
   Operation Rescue, a New York-based anti-abortion group, kicked
off the protests July 19, the second day of the convention, when
scores of activists who were not carrying identification tried to
block access to a clinic where abortions and other procedures are
performed.
   Those arrested refused to give their names, identifying
themselves as Baby Jane Doe or Baby John Doe to show solidarity
with the fetuses. Some remain jailed; others have been identified
or have won their release by giving their names. Comrades keep
coming.
   Authorities won't release those who refuse to give their names,
saying they could not be sure the protesters would return for court
dates.
   Mayor Andrew Young rejected a request last week by 44
congressmen, including the entire Louisiana delegation, to release
the prisoners. He said the protesters could go when they give their
names, and noted that Atlanta pays $10,000 a week in police
overtime because of the protests. It costs about $50 a day to keep
a person in jail.
   The city's tactics in dealing with the activists have changed as
the protests have dragged on.
   The convention expedient of releasing arrested protesters on
recognizance bonds is history; authorities now require cash or a
surety bond ranging from $300 to $2,000.
   About 300 demonstrators remain in city and Fulton County jails,
now mixed in with the general jail population instead of being kept
apart. Some demonstrators are being charged with felony obstruction
counts instead of misdemeanor trespassing.
   Vans taking protesters to the clinics have started getting
traffic tickets.
   But leaders of Operation Rescue continue urging people to come,
block entrances to clinics and get arrested.
   ``Our objective is to close the clinics,'' said Lowell
Patterson, an Operation Rescue spokesman who added that the group
is opening a permanent office in Atlanta. ``The effect is a heavy
arrest load but we're not listing (overloading jails) as a main
goal.''
   He said about 50 of the 134 arrested in the first demonstration
remain in jail, and some have vowed to stay 100 days. The most
recent demonstration was Friday, when 40 were arrested.
   The seven clinics in the metropolitan area remain open, guarded
by police, but Patterson contends that does not mean defeat.
   ``Our objective is to save lives. Preventing people from going
in (to the clinics) is the same thing. Whether it is open or not is
a matter of words,'' he said.
   Lawsuits are pending against Operation Rescue in New York and
Pennsylvania. Attorney Margie Pitts Hames, who represents some
Atlanta-area clinics, said such a lawsuit is being considered in
Atlanta, ``but it is not a priority. (The clinics) have not decided
what to do. The focus has been on maintaining service.''
   Patterson said Operation Rescue has no plans to stop the
demonstrations as long as volunteers are willing to come to Atlanta
and go to jail.
   He told of a businessman from Austin, Texas, due in this week
with a busload of 25 employees and bail money for them, of people
calling promising to arrive weeks hence, saying they are planning
vacation time and arranging for discount air fares.
   ``People from 39 states have been through the jail here,'' he
said. ``Now I'm calling people in states we're missing. I just
talked to a woman in North Dakota who said they were sending down a
van-load. That will be the 40th state.''

<TEXT>
   Neither public protest nor U.S.
pressure has budged Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and the Panamanian
movement to oust the nation's de facto ruler appears mired in
uncertainty and despair.
   Noriega's political foes did not even draw much enthusiasm from
a huge anti-government demonstration that accompanied the funeral
Aug. 15 of a revered former president whom the military threw out
of office three times.
   Tens of thousands of people marched 40 and 50 abreast in the
funeral procession for Arnulfo Arias Madrid, but Roberto Aleman, a
leader of the opposition alliance, discounted its significance.
   ``In the short and medium term, I doubt that it will mean
much,'' he said. ``In the longer term, we may see some life put
back into the movement or we may see it fractionalized. The thing
is, Arnulfo is gone but Noriega's still here.''
   Behind Aleman's assessment was his concern, shared by other
opposition leaders, that the death could split the Authentic
Panamanian Party, which Arias founded and built into the country's
largest opposition force.
   ``There's no one of Arias Madrid's stature in the wings, but if
his followers can unite around someone it would certainly
strengthen the entire opposition movement,'' a Western diplomat
said privately. ``If they don't, the party is likely to be split
into a number of competing factions and that would just muddy
things up.''
   Noriega has weathered a 14-month-old opposition campaign to
force him out as commander of the 15,000-member Panama Defense
Forces, which include the armed forces and police.
   U.S. economic sanctions against Panama and federal indictments
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering have had little
visible impact on Noriega's standing.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, the president Noriega put into office,
rebelled and tried to fire the general a few days after the U.S.
indictments were handed up in February. Noriega arranged for the
National Assembly, which he controls, to dismiss Delvalle instead.
   In speeches, interviews and billboard advertisements, Noriega
says the government will hold a presidential election as planned in
May 1989.
   The main questions are whether Noriega will seek the presidency
and whether the opposition can unite long enough to defeat either
the general or the candidate he chooses. Some opposition leaders
speak of boycotting the election, but most do not see that as an
option.
   Another diplomat said: ``The U.S. sanctions haven't driven
Noriega out, it is doubtful they (Washington) will try a military
solution and there's no one in Panama who can singlehandedly carry
the opposition banner. The people are being driven to despair.
   ``There are a lot of people out there who are against Noriega _
very easily the majority, I'd say _ but they feel abandoned by the
United States and there's not one single opposition leader with
whom they feel comfortable.''
   Morton Abramowitz, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, visited Panama two weeks ago. Opposition
leaders who met him said he offered nothing new.
   One said, on condition his name not be used: ``I got the
impression that nothing will happen until after the (U.S.)
election, and then who knows what?'' Some observers had expected
Noriega to announce his presidential candidacy Aug. 12, his fifth
anniversary as commander of the Defense Forces.
   Noriega dropped no hints at the celebration, however. Instead,
he delivered another diatribe against the United States, accusing
it of creating a crisis in Panama to negate the 1977 treaties that
turn the Panama Canal over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   ``Many Panamanians wrongly thought that with the new treaties of
1977, Panama and the United States were beginning a permanent
honeymoon, forgetting that for the United States a treaty is no
more ... than a useful but ephemeral act,'' Noriega declared.
   On Sunday, the Panama Defense Forces rejected charges that its
troops are harassing U.S. military personnel and called the
accusations part of an effort to undermine the government.
   Its statement injected a note of sarcasm by saying U.S.
officials who make such accusations ``must have the IQ of a
3-year-old Cro-Magnon.''

<HEAD>GOP Convention Pushes Network Ratings To Sag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican National Convention would have
been the top four shows in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings last week
if only one network had been covering it.
   With NBC, ABC and CBS casting about for news in New Orleans,
however, the convention made only one appearance in the top 30
while millions of viewers deserted network television.
   CBS, which had the lowest-rated convention coverage, nearly won
the week with a big surge on Sunday night. Its ``60 Minutes'' and
``Murder, She Wrote,'' tied for first, and CBS' Sunday night movie,
``Outrage,'' came in fifth.
   NBC, however, held on to first place with an average 8.3 rating
for the week that ended Sunday, followed by CBS' 8.2 and ABC's 7.8.
   Each rating point represents 1 percent of the nation's 86.6
million homes with television.
   For the 48 weeks of the season, NBC's average is 14.6, CBS' 12.3
and ABC's 12.2.
   In combined ratings, each of the four nights of the GOP
convention did better than the 15.6 rating for the top-rated ``60
Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote.'' Totals were 19.9 for Monday,
17.6 for Tuesday, 16.7 Wednesday and 20.9 on Thursday.
   The best any one network could do, hower, was ABC's 30th place
finish for its Thursday night coverage.
   Because of the convention coverage, the three networks had only
47 percent of the television viewing audience last week, compared
with 67 percent for the season.
   NBC won the first night of the convention but ABC ran well ahead
in the next three nights, averaging a 6.6 rating. NBC followed with
6.4 while CBS, whose best showing was a second-place tie on
Wednesday night, averaged 5.7.
   During the Democratic convention, NBC averaged 7.4, followed by
ABC at 6.9 and CBS 6.5.
   Though it ran a poor third in convention ratings, CBS
nonetheless won the evening news ratings last week with an average
of 8.8. ABC was second at 8.7 and NBC averaged 8.2.
   After ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder She Wrote,'' the rest of the
top 10 was NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Golden Girls,'' CBS'
``Outrage,'' NBC's ``Different World,'' ``Amen,'' and ``Hunter,''
and a tie between NBC's ``227'' and ABC's Sunday movie, ``Letting
Go.''

   Scientists finished a series of dives
in the nation's deepest lake Tuesday without fulfilling their hope
of finding hydrothermal vents.
   Peter Thompson, the chief ranger at Crater Lake National Park,
said the dives, which began Aug. 5, nevertheless yielded a wealth
of information.
   ``A variety of hydrothermal information, clues as it were, were
seen _ bacterial mats, temperature anomalies, manganese deposits,
which are all in association with hydrothermal activity,'' Thompson
said.
   ``A great deal of biological and geological information is going
to be derived from the samples taken,'' he added.
   Oregon State University scientists Jack Dymond and Robert
Collier took turns making dives in the one-man submersible ``Deep
Rover.'' They are in the second year of a three-year study, funded
by the National Park Service, on the possible effect of hot springs
on the lake.
   The work is part of a larger 10-year study launched when the
1,932-foot-deep lake began to lose some of its famous clarity.
   The work also could produce information for use in the debate
over whether California Energy Co. should be allowed to develop
hydrothermal energy close outside the park.
   Dymond and Collier are scheduled to return next summer for the
last series of dives.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Opposing Politicians Consider Transition
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political associates of George Bush and
Michael Dukakis sat next to each other in a meeting room for a
serious, non-partisan discussion of making the jump from candidate
to president of the United States.
   Many of the participants in a day of quiet talk sponsored by
Boston University's School of Public Communication had taken part
in presidential transitions in the past, many of them by their own
admission seriously flawed.
   Frank Fahrenkopf, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
told the group of senior campaign officials, political appointees
and career civil servants that the next president-elect will have
just 73 days from election to inaugural, the shortest possible
period.
   The president-elect of 1988 will, under the terms of a new law,
have $3.5 million in federal fuding to pay for the staff, office
space and office equipment needed to mount his transition in an
orderly way, Fahrenkopf said, pointing out that none of the money
will be available until after the election.
   Madeleine Albright, senior foreign policy adviser to the Dukakis
campaign, said during Tuesday's meeting that efforts to put
together a transition staff are at a ``very embryonic stage''
because ``he will be devoting all of his efforts to win.''
   But she said that from a subject to which little attention was
ever paid, transition planning ``has now become a whole cottage
industry'' with its own set of specialists producing studies and
reports and issuing critiques.
   Mrs. Albright was on the National Security Council staff in the
Carter administration when the transition to Ronald Reagan's
presidency began.
   ``I think there was a pretty good commitment to hand it over in
good shape to the people coming in,'' she said. ``We had political
differences with them, but there was also a sense of
responsibility.''
   In a sense, she said, Dukakis already has laid the groundwork
for a transition should he win, by reaching out to Congress and
establishing a relationship with the institution and its leaders.
   ``People actually do learn from mistakes,'' she said, noting
there is a sense among many Democrats that ``President Carter came
to town in 1976 not knowing very many of the locals,'' something
that worked against him when he tried to get his program through
Congress.
   David Ifshin, who served as general counsel for the Mondale for
President campaign four years ago, said the transition is important
because it can have three results: get the new president off to a
fast start, establish the momentum that will prevent a primary
challenge when he seeks re-election and help him ``get to a second
term.''
   Darrell Trent, a Reagan deputy campaign manager in 1976 and 1980
and director of policy coordination in the Reagan 1980 transition,
spoke at length of his experience in Richard Nixon's transition in
1968.
   ``Beginning the day after the election, we realized little had
been done to prepare us to take over the government,'' he said,
describing how the transition office took over the 14th floor of
the Pierre Hotel and was faced with the task of ``moving out the
beds.''
   ``No plans had been made for logistical support,'' Trent said.
``And nothing had been done on policy planning. Nixon had thought
it was necessary to concentrate totally on getting elected.''
   By contrast, he said, the incoming Reagan team was ``a model
both campaigns should look at.''
   He said its personnel operation was well organized and a team
was in place immediately after the election ``to go into every
department and agency.''
   A plus, he said, ``was that the Carter administration was
absolutely first-rate to deal with. The president ordered that
every kind of cooperation would be given.''
   Edward J. Fuelner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation,
described that conservative think tank's support work for the
Reagan transition.
   Speaking of the transition's efforts to get a grip on State
Department policy, Fuelner said: ``One of the great difficulties
was coming up with specific questions. The problem was, they never
volunteered the answers to a question if you didn't know enough to
ask.''
   ``We had to keep reminding ourselves that we were not the
government,'' Fuelner said. ``Until that magic moment, someone else
was in charge.
   ``And when that magic moment does occur, you have a sudden loss
of institutional memory'' as the old office holders leave town to
pursue other careers.
   Fuelner had advice he said would work well no matter who wins in
November:
   ``Work hard on your transition team. But keep your transition
efforts very low key, so all of your efforts really are focused on
Nov. 8.''

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh says he
is concerned that a special prosecutor plan aimed at Congress by
his predecessor, Edwin Meese III, is a ``cure where there is no
disease.''
   Thornburgh said in an interview Tuesday that he is taking a
``second look'' at an order Meese signed on his last day as
attorney general that requires special investigations of members of
Congress suspected of criminal wrongdoing.
   ``I want to find out what the underlying premise was in the
issuance of the order,'' said Thornburgh.
   The former Pennsylvania governor, who was sworn in Aug. 12,
arrived in the waning days of the Reagan administration to head a
department that had been buffeted by Meese's tenure.
   Meese was the subject of a lengthy investigation by Independent
Counsel James C. McKay, who declined to seek indictments but said
in his final report that Meese ``probably'' had broken ethics laws.
   Meese's final-day order for special prosecutors to investigate
members of Congress was widely viewed on Capitol Hill as a parting
shot by Meese at his critics there.
   Thornburgh, 56, a former head of the Justice Department's
criminal division in the Ford administration, said Tuesday that it
is ``pretty well known that I see a very limited role for special
prosecutors-independent counsels in the process of investigating
and prosecuting criminal cases.''
   He said U.S. attorneys and the department's office of public
integrity, which investigates corruption of public officials, do a
fine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct, and prosecuting
if necessary.
   Thornburgh established the public integrity office in the
mid-1970s.
   ``I guess what I am curious about is what is being proposed ...
a cure where there is no disease'' he said. ``I am taking what
could be called fairly a second look at that order.''
   While Meese was attorney general, a number of high-ranking
officials resigned, and a number expressed unhappiness with the
attention Meese was forced to give to McKay's investigation.
   Asked how he planned to restore morale, Thornburgh said: ``You
lead by example, and I want to make it clear that my view of the
department is one that requires an absolute fidelity to high
standards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations
... the values and principles of any organization are transmitted
from the top.''
   Thornburgh said he will talk to an advisory group of U.S.
attorneys to see what they think of Meese's last-minute order on
investigations of members of Congress.
   The order requires that attorneys general appoint an independent
counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing made against a
senator or congressman.
   Although the Justice Department already could conduct such
investigations on its own, Meese said his order was designed to
ensure that legislators and top executive officials are treated
equitably.
   The 1978 Ethics in Government Act allows executive-branch
employees to be investigated by special prosecutors, a provision
that was designed to eliminate possible conflicts of interest in
which an administration would be responsible for investigating
itself.
   No comparable conflicts exist when the Justice Department _ part
of the executive branch _ investigates members of Congress, who are
part of the legislative branch.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of a governmental affairs
subcommittee, already had asked Thornburgh to rescind Meese's order
because it contained a drafting error and the public never got a
chance to comment on it.
   During the next five months, Thornburgh said he will ``take
stock and make sure everything is shipshape'' in the department. He
said the department will aggressively pursue the war on drugs and
other criminal activity.
   Although he is a strong supporter of GOP presidential nominee
George Bush, Thornburgh said he will not campaign for Bush and has
no commitment that he will keep his job if Bush wins in November.
   He refused to talk about partisan politics because of the
sensitivity of his position.
   And he said he had no idea when the department's office of
professional responsibility, which looks into the conduct of
Justice employees, will complete its own review of Meese's conduct
to see if it met ethical standards.
   The ethics review began after McKay issued his report last
month. McKay concluded in his final report that Meese probably
broke conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but Meese said the report
``vindicated'' him.

   Several of the Democrats from last month's
national convention still haven't left town.
   ``Neither Dukakis nor Bentsen has been claimed. I think Jesse
Jackson's still there and I think Grits and Fritz are still there,
too,'' said K Thweatt, public relations manager for Georgia's Stone
Mountain Park.
   Dukakis, Bentsen, Jackson, Grits and Fritz are among the 11
donkeys the state park acquired for publicity purposes during the
Democratic National Convention. They have yet to find a new home.
   The park plans to keep two of the donkeys, but the others are
available for $150 each.
   Thweatt said the animals got around quite a bit during the
convention.
   ``They probably went to more prestigious parties and events than
any of us, so we feel like they're very well-traveled donkeys,''
she said. ``They know all the right people. I'm not saying how many
parties they could get their owners into now, but they did all
right during the convention.''
   Thweatt said she's happy the GOP chose New Orleans for its
convention.
   ``I shudder to think what would've happened to the park if we
had had the Republican Convention,'' she said. ``I can't imagine
all those elephants.''

   As Police Chief Roy Osborne explains it,
there just wasn't enough crime in this West Texas town of 25,000 to
justify keeping a patrol officer who worked like a dog.
   ``There was no sense wasting his talent,'' the chief said of
Lazer, a 3-year-old Belgian shepherd. ``He needed to be moved
someplace where he can be used.''
   Lazer recently was shipped to an El Paso security firm.
   ``Our burglaries have been down to the point that we hadn't had
much call to use an animal in building searches. We'd like to have
used him more, but we're glad we didn't have to,'' said Osborne,
who added that he missed Lazer.
   Osborne's decision also was prompted by the request of Lazer's
regular handler that he be transferred from his 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.
shift. The chief couldn't find anyone in the 29-person department
to replace Lazer's keeper.
   But Osborne said that while the canine unit has been disbanded,
his force still has another employee with a nose for sniffing out
crime. Sonny, a golden retriever, will continue to live with one of
the department's detectives and work on drug investigations.

<HEAD>Report: Television Offers Unrealistic Image Of Teen Girls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Television programs fail to show teen-age
girls taking the steps necessary to achieve productive lives,
focusing instead on obsessions with shopping, grooming and dating,
says a women's advocacy group.
   ``These images create the impression that one can magically jump
from an adolescence of dating and shopping to a well-paid
professional career,'' said Sally Steenland, author of a report,
``Growing Up In Prime Time.''
   The study of more than 200 episodes of 19 network television
programs featuring adolescent characters was sponsored by the
National Commission on Working Women of Wider Opportunities for
Women. The non-profit group seeks to improve women's status in the
labor market.
   ``Week after week, viewers see teen-age girls with no visible
skills, no favorite subjects in school, no discussion about college
majors or vocational plans,'' Ms. Steenland said in prepared
comments as the study was released Tuesday.
   ``TV's teen-age girls are portrayed as poised for professional
careers and productive adulthoods without clues to the steps
necessary to achieve those goals,'' the report said.
   The report found:
   _Girls' looks are shown to count more than their brains. Some
episodes portray intelligent teen-age girls as social misfits.
   _Adolescent girls, who outnumber their male counterparts on
television, are more passive than male characters.
   _Weekly plots are lacking in serious conversations with parents,
teachers or peers about school matters, academic interests, career
goals or future plans.
   _Ninety-four percent of teen-age girls on television are
middle-class or wealthy. In reality, more than one-third of
adolescent girls live in families with annual incomes of under
$20,000.
   The study said some episodes featured well-liked, intelligent
girls and teen-agers who linked their interests to career goals,
but the report singled out an installment of ABC's ``Mr.
Belvedere'' for criticism. The episode involved a college
fraternity's ``bowser ball'' to which pledges must invite the
ugliest girls on campus.
   ``Throughout the `Mr. Belvedere' episode, the smart girl is
portrayed as clumsy, homely, unpopular, unsure of herself and
desperate for a date,'' the report said. ``... According to the
show, the drunken advances of a boy who thinks they are ugly and
dates them as a joke are preferable (to being alone).''

<HEAD>Bush and Bentsen Sons Say No Strings Pulled in Their Guard
Sign-ups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sons of George Bush and Lloyd Bentsen say
no strings were pulled to ensure their entrance into the National
Guard during the Vietnam War.
   George W. Bush, son of the GOP presidential candidate, and Lloyd
M. Bentsen III, the son of the Democratic vice presidential
candidate, discussed their military service Tuesday in response to
the flap over whether family influence helped Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle join the Guard and avoid being
drafted for combat in Vietnam.
   The younger Bush and Bentsen were Guardsmen together at
Ellington Air Force Base in Houston. Both said they applied to
enter the Texas Air National Guard in 1968 when it was inevitable
they would be called to serve in the military.
   But the two, who had known one another in Houston before joining
the same Guard unit, said they enlisted on their own without use of
their fathers' influence. Their fathers have affirmed that position.
   Both men said in interviews that they signed up after personally
contacting the commander of the fighter group they wanted to join
at Ellington.
   Circumstances of joining the National Guard have become an issue
in the case of Quayle, a youthful advocate of the Vietnam War who
is now a hardliner on defense in the Senate.
   During the Vietnam era, entrance into the National Guard was
viewed by some as a way to avoid being drafted and sent to Vietnam.
Quayle has denied any such motivation.
   Quayle's student deferment from the draft was about to expire in
1969 and he had been called for his pre-induction physical, an
indication he was about to be drafted. Most of those drafted during
the period were sent to Vietnam.
   A retired Indiana Guard official acknowledged Tuesday that he
told the Guard personnel office to hold open a space for Quayle
after receiving a call from a Quayle family employee in 1969.
   Both Bush's son and Bentsen's son acknowledged it was inevitable
they would have to serve in the military after they graduated from
college, so they chose National Guard service.
   The younger Bentsen, 43, railed at a claim by New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu that Bentsen's father had rushed to get his son a spot
in the National Guard when he learned of an opening.
   ``He was absolutely, categorically wrong,'' the son said.
   ``Shortly after I graduated, I went to a party with some of my
friends and one of the people introduced me to Brig. Gen. Walter
Staudt, who was the commander of the 147th Fighter Group in the
Texas Air Guard.'' Bentsen said Staudt told him at a later meeting
that because of his masters business degree, ``he could use someone
like me'' for an accounting and finance officer.
   Bentsen said he went home and discussed the matter with his
father, a businessman at the time, and decided to enlist. He became
a finance officer ``as luck would have it,'' serving ``past my
six-year requirement,'' and achieving the rank of captain, he said.
   In the younger Bush's case, the circumstances also involved
talking to Staudt.
   ``It was obvious that somewhere I would have to serve and I was
fully prepared to do so,'' said Bush, whose father was a decorated
fighter pilot in World War II. The 42-year-old son said he, too,
wanted to be a pilot.
   ``I heard the National Guard was looking for pilots,'' he said.
He called Staudt, who confirmed the unit did need new pilots. Bush
said he could not remember how he learned of the need for pilots or
knew to call Staudt, but that ultimately he became the third of six
new pilots who were selected in that Texas unit.
   He said he passed the pilot training exam, then served 18 months
on active duty, six months in Houston and another 12 months of
pilot training in Georgia where he flew F102 fighters, then flew on
a regular basis until 1973.
   Bush said he supported the Vietnam cause and he ``jumped at the
opportunity'' to be a pilot, joining the Guard because he could not
be assured a pilot job in the other military branches.
   ``I was going into the service one way or the other,'' he said.
   Some senior pilots from his unit did fly in Vietnam on a
voluntary basis, he said.
   Bentsen's son said he was motivated to join the Guard partly
because he had just finished graduate school.
   ``I felt, as I think all of us did in 1968, that it was
inevitable that we would be drafted within six to nine months. I
didn't worry about going to Vietnam. In general I supported the war
effort. ... My concern was that the military had a history of
mismatching a person's experience with the job that they got and I
was afraid they were going to make me a clerk typist somewhere.''

<HEAD>Quayle Statements on Vets Don't Square with Voting Record, Group
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnam veterans' group is criticizing
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle for voting
against what the group says are the interests of former Vietnam
servicemen.
   ``On a number of different occasions, the Indiana senator has
had a chance to show just how deep his fondness for Vietnam
veterans goes, and in each case he's dropped the ball,'' said Mary
Stout, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   Quayle's military record is under fire amid reports he used the
influence of his powerful newspaper publishing family to join the
Indiana National Guard in 1969, shortly before he would have been
eligible for the draft at the height of the Vietnam War.
   Quayle's office released his military records Tuesday. The 47
pages of military records show that Quayle scored below average on
journalism tests he took after working more than four years as a
National Guard public affairs official.
   But the records don't have any information about whether Quayle
used connections to join the Guard.
   The Vietnam Veterans of America on Tuesday criticized Quayle's
votes in the past two years on veterans-related issues, including
his opposition to a bill making the Veterans Administration a
Cabinet-level department.
   During an appearance Monday night before the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, Quayle also was criticized by some veterans for that same
vote.
   When he introduced Quayle, Larry W. Rivers, the VFW's senior
vice commander-in-chief, was applauded when he said, ``Dan, we
applaud your stance on defense and foreign policy issues, but you
and I still have some talking to do in the area of veterans
legislation.''
   Quayle did a quick about-face on the issue, saying moments
later, ``I'm sure that as I grow older that I will learn my
youthful indiscretions of failing to vote for the Veterans
Administration. I will recognize my mistake and it will turn out to
be the greatest cabinet we have in our government _ no doubt about
that.''
   The Senate voted 84-11 passage on July 12 of the bill making the
VA a Cabinet-level agency. Quayle was one of the 11 opposition
votes. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, voted for the bill.
   A day earlier, both Quayle and Bentsen voted against legislation
which would permit veterans to go to federal courts to challenge VA
decisions, a right that veterans don't now have. Veterans
organizations have pushed for that right of judicial review.
   On Oct. 16, 1987, Quayle voted with the minority in an
unsuccessful attempt to close the 188 storefront counseling centers
scattered around the nation for Vietnam veterans. The Senate
rejected the closure on a 57-33 vote. Quayle was one of the 33
minority votes, while Bentsen voted to keep the centers open.
   Quayle and Bentsen joined a unanimous 89-0 vote on May 8, 1987,
when the Senate approved a bill to continue indefinitely the GI
bill, a sweeping measure which provides education benefits for
veterans.
   Last Dec. 4, Quayle and Bentsen both again joined a unanimous
88-0 vote approving an increase in the disability rate for veterans
and improved veterans benefits.
   Generally, the military records released Tuesday are routine
papers, detailing immunizations and copies of orders mentioning
Quayle's name. Quayle entered the guard May 19, 1969, six days
before he was to graduate from DePauw University and become
eligible for the draft.
   He had been called for his pre-induction physical April 9, 1969,
an indication he was likely to be drafted.
   Quayle spent almost all his Guard career in the 120th Public
Information Detachment. Most of his time was as a clerk-typist,
although he also was rated as a senior information specialist.
   He also was trained as a welder, but he did not perform that
task in the service.
   When Quayle was evaluated as public information specialist in
July 1975, two months after he left the service, he scored 56
points on a written test, 19 points below the average score of 75,
the records show.
   The written test included questions on seven military journalism
categories. Quayle scored ``low'' in five of the seven and
``average'' in the other two. There were five possible scores,
ranging from ``very low'' and ``low'' through ``average,''
``high,'' and ``very high.''
   The written test was one of three parts of the evaluation. The
records do not detail the scores on the other two sections, but
they indicate Quayle's overall rating was an 82. There was no
explanation for the missing scores, nor was there an indication of
how the 82 figure compared with scores for other Guard members.

   Here are major provisions of a trade bill
signed into law by President Reagan on Tuesday to curb record U.S.
trade deficits:
   _Guarantees accelerated congressional consideration of
agreements reached in the current Uruguay Round of international
trade talks and bars any congressional amendments to such measures.
   _Requires the president to retaliate against trade agreement
violations and other ``unjustifiable'' trade practices but permits
the president to waive such action under certain circumstances.
   _Directs the administration to pinpoint high-priority unfair
trade practices and take initial steps toward possible retaliation
while seeking to resolve the problem through negotiations over
three years.
   _Enlarges the definition of unfair trade practices to include
export targeting, or concerted government action to increase the
competitiveness of certain industries, as well as denial of worker
rights and establishment of foreign cartels.
   _Transfers from the president to the U.S. trade representative
authority to decide if a foreign trade practice is unfair under
U.S. law and to take remedial action.
   _Requires companies seeking import curbs against foreign
competition to prove not only that imports are inflicting economic
injury on them but that such relief would help the company adjust
and become more competitive.
   _Authorizes $80 million for worker retraining for employees who
are laid off.
   _Authorizes $980 million a year for two years for a new program
to provide comprehensive aid to displaced workers.
   _Bars Toshiba Corp. of Japan and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of
Norway from selling to the U.S. government for three years and two
of their subsidiaries from selling commercially in the United
States for the same period in retaliation for the subsidiaries'
sale of submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union.
   _Requires the Treasury Department to enter into discussions
aimed at establishing a Third World debt management facility.
   _Extends the Export Enhancement Program _ which pays surplus
farm commodities in government bins to exporters to stimulate
overseas shipments _ for two years and authorizes a level of $2.5
billion.

_ which subsidizes advertising and promotional activities for U.S.
farm goods overseas _ to $215 million. Increases the authorization
for the Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural Service by
$20 million.
   _Establishes a triggered marketing loan program under which the
Agriculture Department would provide major new export subsidies to
wheat, feed grains and soybeans producers for their 1990 crops if
significant progress is not made through trade talks.
   _Repeals the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry earnings.
   _Provides special authority to the U.S. trade representative to

for programs to enhance math, science and language learning with
telecommunications technology, $15 million for regional technology
transfer centers and $2 million each for technology education and
technology literacy.
   _Reduces controls on export of technology, mainly to NATO
countries and Japan, that could have military applications.
   _Bars the Federal Reserve of New York from allowing
foreign-owned securities firms to serve as primary dealers of U.S.
government securities, unless their home countries grant the same
privilege to American firms.
   _Requires the government to initiate multination talks with
other major industrialized countries to achieve better coordination
of economic policies.
   _Directs the Treasury Department to start talks with nations
that it believes are manipulating their exchange rates if they are

   _Relaxes the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to make it easier for
American executives to defend themselves on bribery charges
resulting from payments by their overseas representatives to
foreign officials.
   _Authorizes two so-called ``tied aid'' programs that combine
foreign aid grants with export financing.
   _Directs the president to pinpoint nations that discriminate
against U.S. suppliers in their government procurement, and bars

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Mike Synar defeated a primary challenger Tuesday who
labeled the five-term Democrat too liberal for his Oklahoma
district, while Anchorage, Alaska, voters decided whether to keep
the city in the running for the 1994 Winter Olympics.
   One congressional primary contest was on the ballot in Alaska
and seven in Oklahoma, including a five-person fight for the
Democratic nomination in the district that is comprised largely of
Tulsa.
   In that race, Kurt Glassco, 32, a former prosecutor and onetime
aide to former Gov. George Nigh, won without a runoff over four
other Democrats seeking the right to challenge Rep. James Inhofe,
who was unopposed in the GOP primary.
   Glassco said he was ``ecstatic'' with his success in his first
run for public office.
   ``It means those of us who are mainstream, conservative
Democrats are the majority party here,'' he said. He said he was
confident that the ``Ronald Reagan Democrats will be with us on
Nov. 8.''
   Synar, who describes himself as a moderate not a liberal, said
of his victory, ``It should put these labels to bed once and for
all _ Oklahomans are tired of it.''
   With 348 of 467 precincts reporting in Synar's largely rural
northeastern Oklahoma distrcit, the incumbent had 48,314 votes, or
69 percent, and state Sen. Frank Shurden had 21,730, or 31 percent.
   In the Republican race to challenge Synar, Ira Philips, 50,
director of business development for the Cherokee Indian Nation,
led with 4,895 votes, or 53 percent, to 4,258, or 47 percent, for
Marshall Farrier, 60, a rancher.
   As expected, incumbent Democratic Reps. Dave McCurdy and Glenn
English won re-nomination overwhelmingly, as did Republican Rep.
Mickey Edwards.
   In Alaska, voters selected candidates for the state's lone
congressional seat. Rep. Don Young, a Republican seeking his ninth
term, and Democrat Peter Gruenstein, a former state prosecutor
making his first try for statewide office, were both expected to
win their respective primaries handily.
   Voters in Anchorage decided a ballot issue crucial to the city's
bid for the 1994 Olympic Games _ whether the city government would
agree to cover losses if the local Olympic organizing committee
does not raise enough money to stage the games.
   Passage of the Olympics measure would not assure selection of
Anchorage for the games, but defeat would effectively eliminate the
city from the list of finalists when the International Olympic
Committee chooses the host city next month. The other finalists are
in Norway, Bulgaria and Sweden.
   In 1985, Anchorage voters endorsed the Olympics bid by a 2-to-1
margin, but were not told that the city would have to sign a
financial agreement. In July, a poll sanctioned by the Anchorage
Organizing Committee, which is seeking to stage the games, showed
voters evenly divided on financial guarantees.

   In Oklahoma's 2nd District, the winner of the Democratic primary
is heavily favored in the general election because no Republican
has been elected from the district since 1920.
   Shurden, 47, cited Synar's relatively high ratings from liberal
groups and a vote against a federal death penalty for major drug
traffickers. Synar calls himself a moderate, particularly when
compared with congressmen from other states.
   Synar, 37, gained national attention two years ago with his
successful lawsuit to force changes in the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law. He refuses money from political action
committees and has sought legislation banning advertising of
cigarettes.
   When he was in the state House, Shurden gained wide attention
for winning passage of a bill calling for the castration of
convicted sex offenders. The measure died in a Senate committee.
   In the 3rd District, Democratic Rep. Wes Watkins was unopposed
for re-election in the Democratic primary and there was no one
running in the Republican primary. Oklahoma's four other incumbent
congressmen were also heavily favored in primary races.

   New guidelines that set up a range of
sentences for federal crimes were declared unconstitutional Tuesday
by a federal appeals court _ the highest court to rule on the issue
_ because of the role of judges on the commission that drafted the
standards.
   ``By requiring judicial service on the commission, as well as by
placing the commission in the judicial branch, the (1984
sentencing) act breaches the wall of separation betweeen the
judiciary and the two political branches,'' said the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 decision.
   ``It thereby threatens to squander the precious aura of judicial
impartiality, to the ultimate detriment of the judiciary and the
society it serves.''
   The required placement of three federal judges on the
seven-member sentencing commission violated the constitutional
separation of powers and also interfered with the appearance of
judicial impartiality by allowing the president to appoint and
remove members, said the opinion by Judge Alex Kozinski.
   The guidelines, which took effect last November, recommend
minimum and maximum sentences for each crime, and require the judge
to state unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the
range.
   Federal judges throughout the nation have issued scores of
conflicting rulings on constitutional challenges to the guidelines,
mostly based on the same separation-of-powers issue.
   The 9th Circuit, which covers nine Western states, Guam and the
Northern Marianas, is the first appeals court to rule on the
validity of the guidelines. While the ruling has effect only in the
region, it can influence other circuit courts, but the issue is
likely to be decided ultimately by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The chairman of Sentencing Commission, Judge William Wilkins of
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., said
Tuesday night in Washington on the Larry King radio talk show that
he was disappointed with the ruling.
   But Wilkins added, ``We'll be having a definitive and final
answer from the United States Supreme Court real soon.'' He noted
that the court has scheduled arguments on the issue Oct. 5 on a
case that originated in Missouri.
   The guidelines were challenged by public defenders, who were
unhappy with provisions that lengthened sentences for many crimes
and restricted judges' authority.
   ``We're very happy with the guidelines being thrown out,'' said
Geoff Hansen, an assistant federal public defender in San
Francisco. ``We're just ecstatic that we don't have to deal with
this nightmare any more.''
   But he said lawyers will be ``in some state of uncertainty'' in
dealing with a number of recent cases, including some in which the
guidelines helped individual defendants and others involving plea
bargains based on the guidelines.
   The challenges, in two consolidated cases from San Diego, wound
up before an appellate panel that consisted of three appointees of
President Reagan. Kozinski's opinion was joined by Judge Melvin
Brunetti; Judge Charles Wiggins dissented.
   Kozinski said the commission violated the constitutional limit
on the role of the judiciary because ``its function is political
and not judicial in nature.''
   He said the commission's detailed rules on sentences for each
crime invade the executive and legislative policy-making roles in
numerous ways: for example, it decided that sentences for
white-collar crimes were too short, cut back sharply on the
availability of probation and decided that all defendants except
the poorest must pay fines.
   Wiggins, in dissent, said judges' participation in a commission
that drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep the boundaries
of the judicial role or tarnish judicial impartiality. He said
Congress had set overall sentencing policies and could properly
leave their implementation to a commission that included judges.
   Kozinski, however, also said presidential appointment and
removal of commission members created ``a continuous and fairly
significant entanglement between the judicial and executive
branches of government'' and interfered with the ``aura of judicial
impartiality.''
   ``While we are confident that no federal judge would be swayed
by such considerations, the tens of thousands of persons who
litigate against the government in civil and criminal cases may
legitimately be apprehensive about the fact that the president is
able to dispense plums among the federal judges who will decide
their cases,'' Kozinski said.
   Although judges throughout U.S. history have accepted
appointments on non-judicial commissions, Kozinski said any law
requiring a judge to serve on a commission that made political
decisions was unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection has begun in the trial of
Barry Minkow, the former carpet-cleaning whiz kid accused of
bilking banks and investors out of more than $24 million through a
securities fraud scheme.
   Jury candidates were given a questionnaire Tuesday asking about
their knowledge of the widely publicized case, their ability to be
fair and impartial and their willingness to serve on a trial
expected to last three months.
   The 22-year-old Minkow, who turned his after-school business
into a $100 million carpet cleaning empire, has declared his
innocence, and claims he was a victim of organized crime figures
who manipulated him and his business affairs.
   A panel of 200 prospective jurors jammed the courtroom Tuesday
as U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian opened Minkow's trial by
reading the 57-count indictment against him. It accuses Minkow of
securities fraud, credit card fraud and mail fraud.
   On trial with him is accountant Norman Rothberg, accused of
taking a bribe to retract his warnings that Minkow's ZZZZ Best
company was involved in fraud.
   Minkow was originally indicted with 12 others, 10 of whom have
since pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the alleged
scheme.
   The main allegation against Minkow is that he fabricated
building renovation deals to defraud investors. His ZZZZ Best Co.
actually did no renovation work, the indictment said.
   Investors who handed over millions of dollars were taken on
tours of phony renovation sites, it charges.
   ZZZZ Best has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
sued Minkow and four associates for more than $20 million in
allegedly misappropriated funds.

   Cooler weather and relatively calm winds helped firefighters and
Army regulars as they forged new battle lines against fires in
Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks Tuesday.
   Firefighters also made progress against the Warm Springs Creek
fire, which has destroyed more than a dozen structures southeast of
Helena, Mont. Some of the 2,900 firefighters battling the blaze
were scheduled to go home Tuesday and officials predicted
containment by Wednesday evening.
   In Wyoming, no significant rainfall has been reported in
Yellowstone or Grand Teton since June, but temperatures dipped to
the mid 30s early Tuesday, slowing the spread of 10 fires burning
on about 375,000 acres.
   ``Overnight it (fire acreage) didn't seem to increase too much.
The weather has been cooperative,'' Yellowstone spokeswoman
Michelle Rotter said.
   Fire officials hoped temperatures would dip below freezing
Tuesday night, which, combined with the trace of moisture in the
air, could create frost that could slow the fires' advance.
   More than 1,200 soldiers flown in from Fort Lewis, Wash., have
joined almost 4,000 firefighters who have spent weeks on the front
lines of blazes all over the West.
   Half the soldiers were based at the Shoshone National Forest
near Yellowstone's eastern border to keep the 156,502-acre
Clover-Mist fire from burning into commercial stands of timber,
while the others went to the 4,310-acre Hunter fire in Grand Teton
National Park, said Rotter.
   Yellowstone officials reopened 41 miles of park roads, but the
park's south entrance remained closed Tuesday, forcing visitors to
travel about 150 miles to enter the park through its west entrance,
Rotter said.
   The Grant Village complex, which includes a hotel, campground,
visitor center and staff dormitories, also remained closed and
officials restricted overnight backcountry use in all but the
park's northeastern corner, she added.
   The stubborn Clover-Mist fire shifted to the east, away from the
Montana state line towns of Cooke City and Silver Gate, but
firefighters continued protecting the towns, Rotter said.
   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Grand Teton National
Park, the 6,000-acre Huck fire kept the Flagg Ranch and Rockefeller
Memorial Parkway that links Yellowstone to Grand Teton closed. The
fire ``crowned,'' burning treetops on either side of the road, said
fire information officer Ed Waldapfel.
   In the forest's Teton Wilderness, the 46,750-acre Mink Creek
fire continued to burn, but firefighters hoped to contain the
1,500-acre Emerald Lake fire by Thursday.
   Crews also hoped to contain the 9,000-acre Lost fire in the
Bighorn National Forest Wednesday night, he said.
   In Montana, about 2,900 firefighters strengthened fire lines on
the northeast and southeast flanks of the 37,000-acre Warm Springs
Creek fire southeast of Helena, where it was burning actively. They
also were putting out ``hot spots'' that could flare if winds pick
up again.
   ``All in all, the fire is looking very good,'' fire information
officer Bob Krepps said. ``As long as we don't have the wind, I
think we're going to do OK.''
   Firefighters have built more than 75 miles of lines around the
two-week-old blaze, which destroyed 13 homes and several ranch
buildings last week.
   Firefighters made progress on fencing in two fires in the
Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in southern Montana, just north of
Yellowstone, while forest officials used helicopters to locate and
warn backcountry hikers.
   About 70 firefighters were depending on natural barriers like
lakes and rocky areas to halt the spread of the 24,000-acre Storm
Creek fire about nine miles north of Cooke City, said Leroy White
of the Custer National Forest. Crews also were burning out timber
stands in areas where the fire might escape.
   Fifteen miles to the west, about 500 firefighters sought to
prevent the 27,000-acre Hellroaring Creek fire from spreading to
the northeast, said Phil Cowan of the Gallatin National Forest.
   In southeast Montana, crews had constructed about 18 miles of
lines around the 12,000-acre Kirby fire and hoped to contain it by
nightfall, said Don Kendall of the Department of State Lands. The
fire is sought of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.
   More than 300 firefighters who have helped battle blazes in
Alaska have headed south to help out in Western states, and more
were on their way Tuesday.
   The Alaska Fire Service still classifies 31 fires as active, but
by Tuesday, only one was manned. At the peak of the season, some 50
fires raged, and the service dispatched crews to one-third of them.
   Forest and brush fires broke out across Oregon on Tuesday during
record heat, including at least 20 fires caused by lightning, said
Doug Decker, a spokesman for the state Forestry Department. The
largest was a 200-acre fire at a logging operation 20 miles north
of Wallowa in northeastern Oregon.
   An airplane crashed Tuesday afternoon in the Malheur National
Forest in east-central Oregon, killing three people and starting a
forest fire, the Federal Aviation Administration said. No
information on the fire's size was available.

   A young computer whiz who tried to commit
suicide after creditors and authorities seized his company has been
charged with bilking six investors out of more than $500,000 to
keep his business operating.
   A Nofolk County grand jury handed up an indictment Tuesday
against 24-year-old Tex Zachary Hildreth, charging him with 11
counts of felony larceny.
   He was scheduled to be arraigned today in Norfolk Superior
Court. His attorney did not return telephone calls after business
hours Tuesday.
   Hildreth, who started his computer software firm at age 20 and
lived lavishly, orchestrated ``financial deals where he promised
investors substantial returns,'' said Mike McGorty, a spokesman for
the county district attorney.
   ``The money is still outstanding,'' the spokesman said. ``This
(fraud) could stretch well beyond a million dollars.''
   Some of the money was solicited to pay off other investors and
bank notes, said McGorty.
   Hildreth also is charged with using falsified documents to
obtain bank loans for his Braintree-based company, Massdata Corp.,
McGorty said.
   ``Why he was doing it is something that remains to come out.
This is a very long and careful investigation and it continues,''
he said.
   The grand jury heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses over
two months, McGorty said.
   Each of the 11 counts carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison or a $25,000 fine and two years in prison, McGorty said.
   Hildreth and his mother, Rose, 50, fled Massachusetts just
before his company was closed in May and its assets seized.
   They were found a short time later when an employee at a New
Hampshire hotel called police to report a bloodied man wandering in
the lobby. Police found Hildreth, who apparently had slashed his
wrists. His mother, a former school lunchroom worker who was
employed by Massdata as a clerk, was found lying injured in their
room. Both were incoherent, police said.
   In the room, authorities found what they believed were suicide
notes, said Manchester, N.H., police Lt. William Bovaird.
   Hildreth, who had been charged with larceny of more than $250
after police received a complaint about his business dealings, was
arrested as a fugitive.
   He bought his first computer at age 16 and, with the help of a
mentor, rented office space to start his own software firm at age
20. The confidence he gained prompted the overweight young man to
lose 115 pounds in less than two years.
   He quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success, including
a $220,000 condominium, a $32,000 BMW and a $4,000, 50-inch TV.

   Help is at hand for British motorists in the
United States to keep them from getting stuck on the dual
carriageway with a bad silencer and not a spanner in the boot.
   ``Driving in the U.S.A.,'' a 32-page pamphlet written by two
British journalists, aims to dispel some of the mystery of motoring
the American way, and to protect this year's crop of self-driving
British vacationers from death, speeding fines and big lawsuits.
   The pamphlet is another of those occasional reminders that the
potential for Anglo-American misunderstanding is enormous,
especially on the highways. They drive on opposite sides and have
little in common other than that both use miles instead of
kilometers.
   The dictionary alone takes up 1{ pages: a trunk is a boot; a
hood is a bonnet; a wrench is a spanner; a muffler is a silencer; a
stickshift is a gearshift, a fender is a bumper; gas is petrol; a
trailer is a caravan; a divided highway is a dual carriageway and a
beltway is a ring road.
   Some words don't even have a British equivalent. Thus gridlock
is translated laboriously as a ``traffic jam in all directions.''
   The booklet is filled with surprises as to how much Britons
don't know about American driving, such as toll roads, the fact
that cars with automatic transmissions ``creep forward'' if the
brake isn't pressed, and that speeding can mean fines.
   ``You are not in Great Britain, where many drivers exceed the
speed limit and appear to get away with it. You will not do so in
the U.S. Every state has large numbers of patrol cars, with traffic
police who know every trick.''
   The pitfalls are not obvious ones, such as driving on the right,
but some that ``are dangerously subtle,'' said co-author Tim
Symonds.
   ``There are some very confusing things, like `no standing' or
`speed zone' which don't mean a thing over here,'' he said in an
interview.
   The booklet advises British motorists how much insurance to take
on a rental car to avoid damage claims astronomically higher than
anything at home.
   Under the heading ``The American Policeman,'' motorists are told:
   ``Treated with courtesy and respect, the American `cop' will be
polite, even friendly in a wary sort of way. His (or increasingly
her) job is to enforce the law, prevent crime _ and survive.
American police, with good reason, fear for their lives.''
   So if stopped, just ``leave your hands on the wheel while the
police officer approaches,'' the pamphlet says. ``Do not attempt to
joke, do not get aggressive and do not be insulting or facetious.
Avoid any comments of the `It's-different-in-the-U.K.' variety.''
   With 400,000 Britons going on driving vacations in the United
States this summer, ``there's a lot of potential for mayhem, a lot
of people who will drive out of petrol stations onto the wrong side
of the road,'' Symonds said.
   Symonds, 48, said he gained his expertise as a student in
California, when he would earn money by driving cars from New York
to Los Angeles.
   ``I used about eight different routes and really got to know the
country,'' he said. ``I hate to say it, but I think the Americans
are much better drivers. They're not so prissy. The British have
got laws that make no sense, like not letting you pass on the
inside lane on a four-lane highway.''
   Symonds and co-author Lesley Abdela say 300,000 copies of their
booklet have been distributed to travel agencies and airlines
selling fly-drive vacations in the United States.
   ``Driving in the U.S.A. is not like a Hollywood film; the
American driver is law-abiding and used to driving long
distances,'' writes British publisher John Driscoll in the preface.
   To get his readers into the spirit of things American, he signs
off: ``Have a nice day.''

   The Little Mermaid, staring longingly
out to sea from her rocky perch in Copenhagen harbor, was honored
with a 21-gun salute and a laurel from the mayor as she turned 75.
   She has been beheaded, had an arm cut off, and suffered various
other indignities, but the bronze statue created in honor of writer
Hans Christian Andersen was treated like royalty at Tuesday's
celebration.
   Mayor Egon Weigekamp led the party, placing a wreath of flowers
around the neck of ``Den Lille Havfrue,'' as she is known in Danish.
   Children of 40 nationalities from the Copenhagen International
Junior School waved flags on the quay. Older visitors were offered
free beer by the brewery that financed the statue in 1913.
   The mermaid is one of Copenhagen's most popular attractions,
drawing about 500,000 visitors a year. Pouring rain kept Tuesday's
crowd down to about 100.
   The statue, which sits on a small rock outcropping at the
entrance to Copenhagen harbor, is based on Andersen's tale of the
daughter of the sea king who fell in love with a prince and was
doomed to wait 300 years before she could turn human.
   She leans on one hand, her fish tail stretched behind her, and
she is half turned toward the sea so visitors must strain to see
the wistful look on her face. She has often been used as a symbol
of Denmark, and anti-nuclear activists have depicted her as a
skeleton.
   Visitors often are surprised at her small stature _ about the
size of a small girl _ and artists have debated her artistic value.
   The mermaid was beheaded in 1963 and a new head was cast from
the original mold. The police department called on its homicide
division to handle the case, even though the squad was dealing with
16 unsolved murders. The head was never recovered.
   Twenty years later, hooligans amputated an arm, which also was
replaced. Grafitti and paint splotches are a recurring problem for
city cleaners.
   She was created by Edvard Eriksen, who took the face of Danish
ballerina Ellen Price and modeled her upper body from his wife.
   Eriksen, who lived from 1867 to 1959, attached little artistic
importance to the mermaid. He authorized the manufacture of about
50 half-sized replicas of his mermaid to be placed in public areas
around the world, including Salt Lake City, Stanford University in
California, San Francisco and Solvang, Calif.
   Eriksen's heirs reportedly earn royalties of about $750,000 a
year on trinkets and souvenir models.

<HEAD>Federal Guidelines Ruled Unconstitutional On Separation-Of-Powers
Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court struck down new
guidelines establishing a range of sentences for federal crimes,
ruling the standards are unconstitutional because they were drafted
by judges as a political act.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the highest court to rule
on the issue, said Tuesday that placing three federal judges on the
seven-member sentencing commission violated constitutional
separation of powers.
   In a 2-1 vote, the court decided the use of judges on the
commission interfered with the ``aura of judicial impartiality'' by
allowing the president to appoint and remove members, said the
opinion by Judge Alex Kozinski.
   ``Congress may not, under our system of separated powers,
require judges to serve on bodies that make political decisions,''
Kozinski said.
   The decision affects only the region covered by the 9th Circuit,
comprising nine Western states, Guam and the Northern Marianas.
However, the court is the nation's first on the appellate level to
rule on the validity of the guidelines.
   Other federal judges nationwide have issued numerous conflicting
rulings on challenges to the guidelines, mostly based on the
separation-of-powers issue.
   The guidelines were challenged by public defenders, who were
displeased with provisions that lengthened sentences for many
crimes and restricted judges' authority.
   The chairman of the sentencing commission, Judge William Wilkins
of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court in Appeals in Richmond, Va., said he
was disappointed by the ruling but added, ``We'll be having a
definitive and final answer from the U.S. Supreme Court real soon.''
   Wilkins, interviewed from Washington on Larry King's syndicated
radio talk show, said courts have decided about 200 cases based on
validity of the sentencing guidelines, with the rulings about
evenly divided.
   The Supreme Court has scheduled arguments on the issue for Oct.
5 in a Missouri case, he said.
   Tuesday's ruling on two consolidated challenges from San Diego
said the commission violated the constitutional limit on the role
of the judiciary because ``its function is political and not
judicial in nature.''
   Kozinski said the commission had to make rules and policies
having the force of law, ``tasks that only the legislative or
executive branches, and not the judiciary, may constitutionally
perform.''
   The guidelines, which took effect in November, recommend minimum
and maximum sentences for each crime, requiring the judge to state
unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the range.
   The appeals court also found invalid the 1984 sentencing law
that created the Sentencing Commission and abolished parole in
post-November 1987 cases. Such a ruling would restore the entire
previous law, which generally gave judges wide-ranging sentencing
discretion and provided for parole eligibility after one-third of a
sentence.
   ``We're very happy with the guidelines being thrown out,'' said
Geoff Hansen, an assistant federal public defender in San
Francisco. ``We're just ecstatic that we don't have to deal with
this nightmare any more.''
   But he said lawyers will be ``in some state of uncertainty'' in
dealing with many recent cases, including some where the guidelines
helped individual defendants and others involving plea-bargains
based on the guidelines. The status of parole is also unclear, he
said.
   Kozinski said the commission's detailed rules on sentences for
each crime invade the executive and legislative policy-making roles
in many ways. For example, it said sentences for white-collar
crimes were too short, that all defendants except the poorest must
pay fines. The commission also refrained from issuing any
guidelines on the death penalty, he said.
   Kozinski said the decision on the death penalty, a 4-3 vote of
the commission, apparently resulted from a fear that controversy
over the issue might prevent congressional approval of the
guidelines.
   While the decision leaves the issue of capital punishment with
Congress, it illustrates that ``the commission's work was indeed
substantive and political, not procedural and impartial,'' he said.
   Judge Charles Wiggins, in dissent, said judges' participation in
a commission that drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep
the boundaries of the judicial role or tarnish judicial
impartiality. He said Congress had set overall sentencing policies
and could properly leave their implementation to a commission that
included judges.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Prison Board Turns Down Condom Distribution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of Philadelphia's AIDS program
says he'll push for distribution of condoms in city jails even
though the city prison board rejected the idea, saying it
encouraged homosexuality.
   ``I am totally confident they will change their minds,'' David
Fair, director of AIDS programs for the Health Department, said,
acknowledging that could take years.
   Meantime, Fair said, he will continue with an AIDS education
program for prisoners that encourages abstention.
   The board Monday night rejected the distribution program by 3-2,
with one abstention.
   Fair said the proposal would have made condoms available to
inmates on request _ not, as some board members thought, through
mass distribution.
   ``It makes me very sad,'' Fair said, noting that infected
prisoners can spread the deadly disease after release from jail.
``Somebody is getting infected with AIDS.''
   Board member M. Mark Mendel, a lawyer who strongly opposes
condom distribution, said the policy would have condoned
homosexuality in jails.
   ``This jail isn't a sex factory,'' he said. ``It isn't a place
to shoot up (drugs). This is not proper conduct.''
   During a two-hour discussion before the vote, Public Health
Commissioner Maurice C. Clifford urged approval of the policy,
saying sexual activity was rampant in the city's jails.
   ``We are not condoning sexual activity,'' Clifford said. ``We
are saying it is taking place ... and the best protection against
AIDS is using a condom.''
   Board member Allen Hornblum, who voted in favor of the
distribution, said the issue will not disappear as long as acquired
immune deficiency syndrome spreads.
   ``There will be more pressure to adopt condom distribution,''
Hornblum said.
   Hornblum said he knows of three other prison systems that have
programs allowing distribution of condoms: in Vermont, Mississippi
and New York City.
   Fair said eight prisoners in Philadelphia have been diagnosed as
having AIDS and two prisoners have died from the disease while in
custody.
   He said the number of prisoners infected with the AIDS virus is
hard to estimate, but could be more than half of the 3,700 in
custody.

<HEAD>Court Upholds $450,000 Damage Award Against Clinic in Sinatra Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Swiss clinic that falsely claimed it had
treated Frank Sinatra with a ``youth serum'' of sheep cells has
been ordered to pay the singer $450,000 in damages.
   ``It's excellent (that the court) has seen fit to vindicate the
right of a U.S. citizen to protect his name and his reputation from
avaricious appropriation, both here and abroad,'' said John A.
Lawrence, a lawyer for Sinatra.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld the
September 1986 award against the Clinic La Prairie, rejecting the
Montreux, Switzerland, clinic's claim that U.S. courts lacked
jurisdiction in the case.
   ``The clinic's employees fabricated an elaborate story
calculated to link Sinatra's name with their services,'' said Judge
Dorothy Nelson in the 3-0 decision.
   Patricia Beaman, a lawyer for the clinic, was unavailable for
comment Tuesday, her office said.
   The dispute stemmed from an October 1984 article in the National
Enquirer that said Sinatra had been treated at the clinic with a
``youth serum'' extracted from sheep cells intended to retard aging.
   But Sinatra had never even visited the clinic, although an
attempt was made to recruit him as a patient, according to the
court.
   While the clinic has no branches in California, it was trying to
solicit business in the state when it planted the phony story in
the tabloid in 1984, knowing that Sinatra lived in the state and
the Enquirer circulated widely here, the court said.
   ``The clinic viewed the article as essentially a free
advertisement that could reach between 5 million and 20 million
people,'' Nelson said in the 3-0 decision.
   The court said the Enquirer called the clinic the previous month
asking if Sinatra had been a patient. The clinic's U.S.
representative, Richard Van Vrooman, then arranged a visit by an
Enquirer reporter, who was given false statements by the clinic's
president, medical director and others about Sinatra's supposed
visit and their personal contacts with him, the court said.
   Sinatra sued the Enquirer and the clinic in Los Angeles, and
later settled the case against the newspaper on undisclosed terms.
   The clinic said the court lacked jurisdiction and refused to
take part in the trial; Chief U.S. District Judge Manuel Real,
after hearing Sinatra's witnesses without a jury, awarded $350,000
for the value of the unauthorized use of his name, and $100,000 in
punitive damages.

<HEAD>Former Guard Says He Entered Quayle's Unit With Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An unemployed truck driver who served in the
Indiana National Guard with Dan Quayle says he needed no special
connections to secure a spot with the Guard.
   Retired Sgt. Stephen W. Morell says he dropped out of college,
walked into a recruitment office and was offered a clerk-typist's
position within 90 days. He served side-by-side with the Republican
vice presidential candidate.
   ``We entered the Guard the same rank and left the Guard the same
rank,'' Morell told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. ``And I
was a nobody.''
   Sen. Quayle of Indiana has been accused of using family
connections to gain a position at the Guard's Headquarters
Detachment, where he eventually worked in a public information unit
that published news releases and a quarterly magazine, The Indiana
Guardsman.
   ``If his family really had all this influence like everyone
says, he would have been sent directly to officer's candidate
school and come out a lieutenant or captain,'' Morell said.
   ``Dan was an OK guy,'' Morell said. ``He did his job and I did
mine. We washed dishes and washed jeeps together.''
   Capt. Cathi Kiger, a National Guard spokeswoman, confirmed the
service was below its authorized strength when the then-22-year-old
Quayle signed up in May 1969.
   ``I can find no evidence that he was given special consideration
and there was no need,'' Kiger said. ``Units that were not up to
100 percent strength could continue to recruit.''
   But Maj. Gen. Alfred Ahner said Tuesday that he received a call
at that time regarding Quayle from an editor of the Indianapolis
News, one of several newspapers published by Quayle's maternal
grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam.
   As a result of that call, Ahner said he contacted the Guard's
personnel office on Quayle's behalf.
   ``They said they had a couple of spaces,'' Ahner told the AP on
Tuesday. ``I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming
over.''
   Ahner also said in an interview with WTHR-TV, ``I couldn't have
done a thing ... if there hadn't been a vacancy.''
   Retired Col. Jerome Rafferty said Quayle was a prime candidate
for the Guard based on his background and, at least in part, ``the
way the system works.''
   ``The unit Sen. Quayle served in was a specialized unit. He
could have been recruited very simply for the fact that he got a
college degree, was in law school and had a newspaper background,''
said Rafferty, who was director of personnel for the adjutant
general's staff in 1969.
   Rafferty acknowledged the recommendations of high-ranking
officers carried some weight.
   ``If .... any of the generals called me and said they knew a man
who would make a good Guardsman, I'd prick my ears because they
only sent the highest quality young man,'' Rafferty said. ``That's
the way the system worked.''
   A 1969 Guard report indicated the Indiana Guard was overextended
in mid-1969, but a separate month-by-month breakdown made available
to The Associated Press on Tuesday showed Quayle's detachment had
an authorized strength of 138 people in May 1969. Guard records
show 134 men were in the unit at the end of April, 132 were serving
in May _ when Quayle joined _ and 133 men were enlisted in June.

   Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to demand greater autonomy on the
49th anniversary of the pact that led to the Soviet takeover of
their Baltic nations, activists said.
   Demonstrators waved the flags and sang the anthems of their
former nations Tuesday and carried banners denouncing the secret
agreement between the Kremlin and Nazi Germany, the activists said.
   Some called for independence from Moscow.
   Three years after the Aug. 23, 1939 pact was reached, the
Soviets moved into the three countries.
   ``This is another step toward Lithuanian independence,'' said
Antanas Terleckas, a 60-year-old former political prisoner. He said
he attended a rally of about 200,000 people at Vingis Park in
Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.
   According to reports from activists in the three republics,
about 300,000 people demonstrated. Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, estimated the total at 100,000.
   The demonstrations, unprecedented in size, were another
indication of ferment in the Baltic republics under Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of greater openness.
   Authorities gave permission for the demonstrations, and there
were no reports of violence or arrests.
   Moscow-based foreign reporters who sought to cover the events
were told by state-run agencies that no plane or train tickets or
hotel accommodations were available.
   In Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city, an estimated 50,000
people gathered for a candlelight Roman Catholic Mass and
procession, said Valdas Analauskas, correspondent in Lithuania for
the unofficial journal Express Chronicle.
   At least 8,000 Estonians attended an outdoor rally and filled
the Tallinn town hall for a panel discussion about Josef Stalin's
repression of the Baltic states.
   Ents Tsavilitis, a former political prisoner and a member of an
unofficial environmental group, said he was among 30,000 to 40,000
people who demonstrated in Riga, the Latvian capital.
   In a report from Riga, Tass said ``several thousand'' people
attended a meeting organized by informal political groups. It
estimated the number of demonstrators at Kaunas as 10,000 and
characterized the rallies as dedicated to condemning Stalinism.
   Tass reports on the day's activities were unusually detailed and
speedy.
   Terleckas said many yellow, green and red flags of independent
Lithuania were displayed in Vingis Park and that the three-hour
gathering closed with the singing of the anthem of independent
Lithuania.
   Nationalist flags also were displayed in Riga and Kaunas, and
the outdoor gathering in Tallinn ended with the Estonian anthem
from pre-Soviet days, activists said.
   The 1939 agreement was a non-aggression pact that divided
Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. It is
commonly called the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact after Foreign Ministers
Vyacheslav Molotov and Joachim von Ribbentrop, who signed it.
   Tsavilitis said protesters in Riga listened to more than a dozen
speakers, including one who read a message of support from a group
of U.S. senators.
   The Riga protesters carried the national flags of all three
Baltic nations, he said.
   Protesters would have risked jail or fines not long ago for
displaying the national flags, but officials in the Baltics have
eased up recently and some have expressed limited support greater
autonomy.
   Leonard Bartkevich, the Latvian foreign minister, defended the
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and declared that the Baltic states
voluntarily joined the Soviet Union to protect themselves from
Germany.
   He said in an interview with Tass: ``There was one alternative,
either union with the U.S.S.R., or Hitlerite occupation and
enslavement.''
   Soviet officials say the pact was necessary to buy time to
prepare for Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, which occurred in
1941.

   Residents in this Baltic port where
Solidarity was born stocked up on sugar, flour and bread, fearing
shortages during Poland's worst outbreak of labor unrest since 1981.
   ``I'm making sure I'm prepared,'' said one elderly woman.
   State-run media, in a campaign to erode public sympathy for the
striking workers, on Tuesday quoted factory workers as blaming the
strikers for long lines and shortages.
   ``We are scared by the lines in the stores,'' Warsaw Radio
quoted a textile worker in Lodz as saying. ``Poland went through a
very hard time in 1980 and we should have learned from this.''
   Goods were in short supply during the tide of strikes eight
years ago the spawned Solidarity, the only independent labor
federation ever allowed in the Soviet bloc.
   Although there was no evidence of panic-buying in Gdansk stores,
residents said many people had rushed out to buy basic staples
early Tuesday.
   But the stores were later restocked and even supplies of scarce
commodities turned up on store shelves after a long absence,
residents said.
   ``Now you can get cheese and ham,'' said a 20-year-old native of
the country's largest port. ``They have been in short supply or
missing for two months.''
   The government pledged to increase distribution of staples and
other goods during the strikes, which began Aug. 16 and seek higher
wages and reinstatement of Solidarity, which was outlawed after
being crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown.
   The government contends Solidarity activists are exploiting
Poland's economic woes and strikes are creating unnecessary
hardships for citizens.
   Residents of Gdansk, where strikes have idled the port and the
Lenin shipyard, expressed surprise at the announcement Monday night
by Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak empowering officials to
impose curfews in areas hit hard by strikes.
   ``People were surprised by the curfew announcement because the
media have only reported that there were rallies, and no strikes in
Gdansk,'' said one young resident.
   The radio quoted a worker who said he approved of Kiszczak's
curfew order.
   ``The only criticism I have is that it should have come
earlier,'' the worker said.
   Strikers at the Lenin shipyard, where Solidarity was founded,
said the threat of curfews was meant to intimidate strikers and
their families and scare the population into turning against them.
   ``We are not afraid,'' said an 18-year-old worker at the yard.
   Most doubted a curfew would be imposed in the city.
   ``We have thousands of tourists here,'' said a resident. ``How
do you think a busload of German tourists is going to react when
you tell them to be in by 9 p.m.?''

   The government will restrict to a
border area Contra rebels who have in the past four months entered
the country in a mass exodus from Nicaragua, the foreign minister
said.
   The government is keeping the rebels near the Nicaraguan border
to prevent instability in Honduras, Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez
Contreras said Tuesday.
   Contra officials have said more than 14,000 rebels and civilian
supporters of their campaign against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
leaders entered Honduras in the past four months, seeking refuge
and humanitarian aid distributed by the United States.
   Lopez Contreras said Honduras was allowing the U.S. aid to reach
the Contras as part of the peace plan signed last year by five
Central American presidents.
   He said the Contras cross the frontier frequently because, under
the plan, they were to be assigned to a zone in Nicaragua that
borders Honduras. But he acknowledged that some Contras were
``entering Honduras as refugees, then later returning to their
country to fight.''
   Since 1981, the U.S.-supported rebels have maintained base camps
in Honduras in their fight to overthrow the Sandinistas. A
provisional cease-fire has been in effect in Nicaragua since March
21.
   Lopez Contreras noted that anti-communist rebels from Nicaragua
and leftist guerrillas from El Salvador have used frontier
territory for their war bases, damaging Honduras' social stability.
   He said the superpowers had created ``peculiar'' problems for
Honduras, with the United States supporting the Contras and the
Soviet bloc backing Nicaragua's Sandinista government and the
Salvadoran rebels.
   There have been several anti-American demonstrations this year
in Honduras, which is considered one of Washington's strongest
allies in the region.

   Ethiopia and Somalia have started
exchanging more than 3,700 prisoners of war, some held since the
two Horn of Africa neighbors began fighting over a patch of desert
11 years ago.
   The scheduled 10-day operation follows an accord signed by
Ethiopia and Somalia in April and involves some prisoners held
since hostilities began in 1977, said the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
   On its first flight Tuesday, a Red Cross-chartered plane brought
176 Ethiopians and a Cuban from Somalia's capital Mogadishu to Dire
Dawa, Ethiopia, and returned to Mogadishu with 111 Somalians, a Red
Cross statement said.
   The Geneva-based group is supervising the exchange.
   The exchange left 3,421 Ethiopians in Somalia and 118 Somalis in
Ethiopian hands.
   Under an April 6 accord, both sides agreed to withdraw troops
from their borders, a move which was completed in May.
   They also agreed to swap prisoners and restore diplomatic
relations, severed at the outbreak of the 1977-78 Ogaden war.
   Somalia had invaded the arid region, which Ethiopia owns but is
populated by ethnic Somalis.

<TEXT>
   Seven senior members of the House Armed
Services Committee want the Pentagon to add provisions in future
defense contracts to ensure that any illegally gained profits can
be recovered by the government.
   The call arises from the current investigation into allegations
that private consultants illegally bought information about future
contracts from Pentagon employees.
   ``There is an urgent need to protect both the national security
and the interests of the U.S. taxpayer in defense procurement,''
the congressmen said in a statement issued Tuesday.
   ``A clause in all future contracts allowing the Defense
Department to recover the profit from illegally obtained contracts
would go a long way toward doing that,'' it said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other top Pentagon
officials have said the Pentagon can use existing laws to recover
the profits if any of the contracts involved in the investigation
turned out to have been won on the basis of illegal information.

   The Department of Education says the cost of
sending America's children to public elementary and secondary
schools is expected to be $4,810 this year, up more than $2,000
since 1980.
   The new estimate puts spending on education well ahead of
inflation in this decade, department statistics released Tuesday
show.
   The $2,762 per pupil spending of the 1980-81 school year would
have risen to $3,462, if simply adjusted for inflation. Yet the
department expects spending to top that by nearly 39 percent.
   Increased spending by state and local governments in an effort
to improve schools was cited by statistician Vance Grant as a major
reason for spending being ahead of inflation.
   Overall, the agency expects education spending at all levels,
public and private, to rise to $328 billion for the coming school
year, a record. That is up from $308.8 billion last year and $182.8
billion in 1980-81.

<HEAD>Administration Accused of Using `Excuse' To Break ABM Treaty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of the private Arms Control
Association says the Reagan administration is using a disputed
Soviet radar facility in Siberia as an excuse to undercut the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   A five-year review of compliance with the treaty, which
restricts U.S. and Soviet anti-missile defenses, opens on Wednesday
in Geneva.
   President Reagan has authorized American negotiators to accuse
the Soviets of a ``material breach'' of the pact with the radar
facility at Krasnoyarsk. Such a charge would give the United States
the right to break out of the treaty.
   Spurgeon Keeny, who heads the Arms Control Association, said
Tuesday he agrees the facility violates the treaty. But, he said,
``a material breach can only be claimed by a country seeking an
excuse to suspend or terminate the ABM treaty.''
   Keeny, a former deputy director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said ``it may set in motion a series of events
that could have a very serious impact.''

<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 40,000 owners of Chrysler
Motors Corp. cars whose odometers were disconnected while company
executives test-drove them are entitled to more than $16 million in
restitution under a nationwide settlement.
   Attorneys general from 10 states assisted in the settlement,
which will pay the wronged car owners at least $500 apiece,
Missouri Attorney General William Webster said at a news conference
Tuesday.
   Chrysler already has announced it will increase warranty
coverage for cars on which odometers had been disconnected in the
company's ``Overnight Evaluation Program.'' A few were involved in
accidents, and consumers that later purchased those cars will
receive new automobiles, Webster said.
   Webster served as the lead negotiator in the settlement
affecting 39,500 consumers in 46 states, Guam and Puerto Rico. The
agreement was filed Aug. 19 in U.S. District Court in St. Louis.
   The states that did not participate in the settlement were
Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada and South Carolina, Webster said.
   Webster said his office and officials in some other states were
mailing letters to the car owners. Chrysler also will run
advertisements about the settlement in 20 newspapers Friday, he
said.
   ``The practice by Chrysler of selling what were supposed to be
new cars which had already been driven hundreds of miles is in my
opinion a deplorable business practice that results in deceiving
consumers,'' said Kansas Attorney General Robert T. Stephan, who
also announced the settlement.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said the company has set
aside $16.3 million to settle the claims, but will add more money
to the reimbursement fund if that runs out.
   In the test-drive program, new cars were driven by company
executives before the vehicles were shipped to dealers. The program
had been going on for many years, said Webster, who added that
mileage on the cars probably ranged from 40 miles to 300 miles.
   The settlement affects consumers who purchased a car made by
Chrysler before Oct. 9, 1986, and which was involved in the
Overnight Evaluation Program. Consumers must have owned that car on
July 31, 1987, to be reimbursed.
   U.S. District Court Judge John F. Nangle will hold a fairness
hearing regarding the settlement Oct. 11 in St. Louis, Webster said.
   Consumers who have objections about the settlement must file
complaints with the court by Sept. 30.
   Stewart said if the judge approves the settlement, most
purchasers of the cars would receive payments early in 1989.

<HEAD>Obscure Clause In Trade Bill Aims To Make America `Measure Up'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Give 'em an inch and they'll take a
kilometer.
   Crusaders for wider use of the metric system are happy about an
obscure section of the trade bill signed Tuesday by President
Reagan, a section they say will help America measure up in a metric
world.
   The bill designates the metric system as the preferred method of
measure for trade and commerce and requires government agencies to
start buying metric whenever practical.
   For the U.S. Metric Association, which since 1916 has been
prodding America to join most of the world in using metric measure,
the bill is a milestone, or perhaps a kilometer post.
   ``I think the government's decision to adopt this law is pulling
the country in the right direction,'' said Lorelle Young,
association president.
   ``We interpret it to be saying that the metric system is highly
important to the United States _ to educate our youngsters in this
scientific world, to put us in sync with the rest of the world and
to give us the advantage of the best measurement system ever
devised.''
   The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 gives U.S.
negotiators more leeway to bargain at international trade talks,
strengthens the government's ability to fight restrictive trade
policies of other countries, and provides for retraining of
Americans who lose their jobs because of foreign competition.
   It also says that by 1993, agencies should ``use the metric
system of measurement in procurement, grants and other
business-related activities, except to the extent that such use is
impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiency or loss
of markets to U.S. firms.''
   Analysts at the National Association of Manufacturers don't
expect much impact from the section because of the language giving
agencies an economic out, said Howard Lewis, a vice president of
the Washington, D.C., lobbying group.
   But for the 3,500-member Metric Association, which promotes the
switch nationwide from its headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb
of Northridge, the bill seems likely to hasten the inevitable
conversion.
   Ms. Young recalled with relish that the bill's example of an
economic hardship big enough to win an exemption from the metric
policy was a company faced with competition from a foreign producer
of non-metric goods _ an unlikely situation.
   Automakers and other sectors of heavy industry are gradually
getting on the metric bandwagon, Ms. Young said, though lumber and
machine tool industries are notable for their adherence to
tradition.
   ``Our liquor industry hasn't suffered,'' she noted, ``and they
were one of the first to convert.''
   The metric system uses weights and measures, such as the liter
and the gram, that are multiples of 10. Calculations in the
traditional English system are more difficult because that system
is based on varying multiples.
   Little has been done to promote use of the metric system
nationwide since passage of the Metric Act of 1975, said Valerie
Antoine, executive director of the association.
   ``The act set up a U.S. metric board that would monitor a
changeover and educate the public, but it was not given any real
clout,'' she said. ``They didn't really get any place.''

<HEAD>Navy Chief Reveals Details of Building Program</HEAD>

   Israel is building
three huge missile boats and two submarines under a U.S-financed
program that will better equip it to thwart terrorist attacks, the
nation's navy chief says.
   Rear Adm. Avraham Ben-Shoshan outlined details of the $1.2
billion program on Tuesday, Navy Day. He said the submarines and
two of the three missile boats should be deployed by the mid-1990s.
   ``The terrorists are making serious efforts to invest people,
resources and training to develop a better capability. We must be
prepared in time,'' Ben-Shoshan said.
   The missile boats will carry new weapons against aircraft,
missiles and submarines. The new ships, each to cost $120 million,
are nearly 400 feet long and will accommodate more weaponry and
helicopters.
   ``We believe this ship must carry many weapons because we have a
lot of enemies and very few missile boats,'' said Ben-Shoshan.
   He said one new weapons system is the Barak anti-missile
missile, to be deployed in the early 1990s. Described as highly
accurate, it carries an explosive head weighing 48 pounds and can
be used at a range up to 7{ miles.
   Ben-Shoshan said the anti-missile missile was preferable to
systems designed to confuse and divert incoming missiles.
   ``We must have a hard kill, and the Barak system gives us a hard
kill. This will be the answer to the missile threat for the Israeli
navy,'' he said.
   He said the system could also be used against helicopters and
ships.
   The new ships are needed to replace French-designed boats up to
20 years old. Those include some of the vessels Israel commandeered
from Cherbourg after France imposed an arms embargo because of the
1967 Middle East war.
   According to the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv
University, Israel's navy has 28 missile-carrying ships, including
two highspeed hydrofoil craft shown for the first time Tuesday.
   The Geula, demonstrated for reporters outside Israel's northern
port of Haifa, is Israel's largest ship.
   The Israeli-built vessel is 198 feet long, weighs 450 tons and
carries a helicopter. It is armed with U.S.-made Harpoon
surface-to-surface missiles and Vulcan Phalanx anti-aircraft guns.
   Ben-Shoshan said the terrorist threat remains high even though
guerrillas launched just five attacks from the sea last year.
   In the past three years, the navy has killed 58 guerrillas and
captured 100, he said.
   During the past year, the navy stopped two attempts by Lebanese
Shiite Moslems to plant mines and on two occasions destroyed
guerrilla boats hiding among fishing vessels off Lebanon,
Ben-Shoshan said. It also stopped a rubber raft trying to enter
Israeli waters.
   Ben-Shoshan reached agreement with U.S. officials on financing
the expansion program during a visit to Washington in June.
   He said U.S. firms are bidding to build the ship and various
systems and West Germany was among European countries competing to
build the submarines.
   Israel has three aging British-made Vickers Type 206 submarines.
It turned to European manufacturers after the United States refused
to build the diesel-powered submarines. Ben-Shoshan gave no details
on the new submarines.
   The admiral defended Israel's stopping ships in international
waters of the Mediterranean, saying it has to go as far afield as
needed to protect its coastline.
   He said Israel's navy stopped 40 ships in the past year and
about four were found to have hostile intent. The navy impounded 10
other vessels carrying 10 tons of drugs, most of it hashish, he
added.

<TEXT>
   First lady Nancy Reagan has taken a close
look at work being done on the $2.5 million Bel-Air estate where
she and President Reagan will live after they leave the White House.
   Mrs. Reagan spent Tuesday afternoon at the single story,
ranch-style home nestled in the shadow of the ``Beverly
Hillbillies'' TV mansion as workers busied about and tourists
passed by in search of stars' homes.
   ``Welcome Nancy and Ron,'' said a hand-lettered sign posted by a
neighbor. ``Lost, 2 Cats _ Tan & Dark,'' said another sign, on a
tree across the street.
   Secret Service agents in the driveway peeked through trees and
over gates while Mrs. Reagan was inside the 35-year-old house,
which has a view of the Pacific Ocean and downtown.
   ``She's checking on the progress. She won't be making major
renovations, just some grooming,'' said her spokeswoman, Elaine
Crispen.
   Mrs. Reagan had appointments with painters, carpenters and
wallpaper hangers this week, she said.
   Reagan has yet to see the leased home, which has three bedrooms,
six bathrooms, a formal living room, a family room, sun room, a
butler's pantry and three servants' rooms.
   The house, where the Reagans will live after the next president
is inaugurated on Jan. 20, was known for years as the ``demon
house'' because of its 666 Saint Cloud Road address. The number was
recently changed to 668 because of the Satanic nature of the old
number, referred to in the New Testament as the sign of the
Antichrist.
   The street is lined with tall pines, eucalyptus trees and huge
oleanders. From the street, onlookers can see a rose garden through
the chain-link fence.
   ``It's sure rich,'' tourist Irv Kroker, 49, of Winnipeg said as
his family surveyed the neighborhood. ``I wish I lived here,'' said
his wife, Diane.
   Decorator Ted Graber, commissioned by Mrs. Reagan to redo the
family quarters in the White House, is helping the first lady with
the house.
   Ms. Crispen said Mrs. Reagan will use furnishings from the
Reagans' former Pacific Palisades home that have been in storage,
and items from the White House.
   The estate, reached by driving up winding roads, is a modest
residence in the pricey Santa Monica Mountains neighborhood.
   Neighbors include Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Rivers, Zsa Zsa Gabor
and, next door on higher ground, the Kirkeby estate, where
``Hillbillies'' was filmed.
   Vans from three Hollywood tour lines pass by regularly, pointing
out the ``Hillbillies'' mansion but bypassing the not-yet-famous
Reagan home.
   The estate is owned by Wall Management Services, a group of
about 20 unidentified Reagan friends who bought it on Aug. 21, 1986.
   The three-year lease gives the Reagans the option to renew the
lease or purchase the property. The estate includes 1.4 acres of
grounds, the house with 7,192-square-feet of living space and a
pool.
   The Reagans also own an adobe house at Rancho del Cielo, their
vacation ranch on a 2,250-foot-high mountaintop 30 miles northwest
of Santa Barbara.

<HEAD>U.N. Experts Find Iraq Used Mustard Gas Against Iranian Civilians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. team of chemical weapons experts
has backed Iran's claim that Iraq dropped mustard gas on an Iranian
city this month in a raid that came after both sides had accepted a
U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   In a note attached to the report Tuesday, Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar said the bomb attack violated provisions in
the 1925 Geneva Convention on the use of poison gases.
   There were no reported deaths in the Aug. 2 attack on the city
of Oshnaviyah, which is a few miles from the northeast corner of
Iraq, though Iran said 2,680 people were injured. Baghdad denied
responsibility for the raid.
   The chemical weapons experts said they found medical and
chemical evidence of mustard gas, including shell fragments like
those used in previous gas attacks, when they visited the site Aug.
12-14.
   The attack at 2:45 a.m. on the civilian residents of Oshnaviyah
took place ``in an area adjacent to an urban center lacking any
protection against that kind of attack,'' the team said in its
report to the Security Council.
   At the time of the attack, both Iran and Iraq had accepted
Security Council Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in
their nearly 8-year-old war, though negotiations on a truce
starting date were still in progress.
   Patients injured in the attack and Iranian authorities told the
team that a propeller-powered plane dropped eight bombs as most
residents slept. Four bombs landed in a neighboring field and four
fell in nearby mountains.
   When the U.N. team arrived, 24 of those injured in the attack
were still hospitalized, most of them farmers who lived near the
field where the four bombs fell.
   The team said the farmers and their wives suffered coughing and
skin blisters, symptoms typical of mustard gas attacks.
   Air and soil samples taken at the bomb sites were analyzed in
Swiss and Swedish laboratories and found to contain mustard gas
agents, the team reported.
   Security Council President Li Luye of China held talks about the
report with other members of the council Tuesday, said U.N.
spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
   Members of the U.N. team were Dr. Erik Dahlgren of Sweden's
Defense Research Establishment; Col. Ulrich Imobersteg, former
chief of Switzerland's nuclear, biological and chemical defense
force; and Dr. A.N.P. van Heijst, former director of the Dutch
National Poison Control Center.

<HEAD>Doom May Await Fourth Comet Discovered By Amateur Astronomer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fairly close brush with the sun may spell
doom for the fourth comet discovered by an amateur astronomer who
spends 100 nights a year searching for the ``dirty snowballs'' in
space.
   Don Machholz, who holds a kind of unofficial record for the most
hours spent unsuccessfully comet watching, spotted Comet Machholz
1988j with his giant, homemade binoculars on Aug. 6, but conceded
there's ``some cause for concern about its existence.''
   The comet ``might sort of fizzle out'' about the time it makes
its closest approach to the sun on Sept. 17, agreed Brian Marsden,
director of the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau
for Astronomical Telegrams.
   ``That happens with comets that are not terribly big to start
with going only 15 million miles from the sun. It's pretty hot
there. It may disintegrate completely,'' Marsden said by phone from
Cambridge, Mass., where his agency records astronomical discoveries.
   ``It's 80 million miles from the sun as we speak,'' Machholz
said Tuesday from his office in Santa Clara. ``It will go twice as
close to the sun as Mercury and six times as close as Earth.''
   Machholz said the comet is ``a very nice looking comet, but it's
not getting brighter as it should,'' suggesting that the dust-laden
balls of ice is too small to give off enough gas and dust to form a
bright head.
   It won't be the first time a comet broke up after being
discovered by Machholz, 35, of San Jose, who works at a company
that makes medical lasers. But he doesn't mind.
   ``It's kind of a gift to find a comet. You're grateful,'' he
said. ``So if it's taken away, that's the way it goes.''
   Machholz said his second discovery, Comet Machholz 1985 VIII,
disintegrated when it got within about 11 million miles of the sun.
He also discovered comets Machholz 1978 XIII and Machholz 1986 VIII.
   During a typical year, about six comets are discovered and six
known comets are ``recovered,'' or spotted during their latest
orbits through the inner solar system, Marsden said. The `j' in the
new comet's name means it is the year's 10th either discovered or
recovered. Last year, a record 16 comets were discovered and 17
recovered.
   Comet Machholz 1988j ``is a couple hundred times fainter than
the North Star,'' Marsden said. ``It's not going to be a bright
comet,'' and is likely to be seen only by advanced amateur
astronomers using telescopes.
   While more comets have been discovered by other astronomers,
Machholz holds the record of four for U.S. amateur astronomers who
are still alive, Marsden said.
   Machholz made his latest discovery after 475 hours of
observation from his customary viewing spot, along a dirt road
3,300 feet up Loma Prieta, a peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains south
of San Francisco Bay.
   ``I'm up there about 100 nights a year. Most of the time it's
after midnight,'' he said. His biologist wife, Laura, and
2-year-old son accompany him but sleep in the back of the family
truck.
   As with his 1986 discovery, Machholz spotted the comet using a
pair of homemade binoculars weighing 150 pounds. He found his first
two comets with a 10-inch reflector telescope.
   ``I enjoy comet hunting,'' he said. ``It's a challenge.''
   Despite his discoveries, Machholz is better known for spending
1,700 hours searching before discovering his first comet. His
second comet took 1,742 hours to find.
   ``It's the longest period of time anybody is known to have spent
unsuccessfully comet hunting,'' Marsden said.

   Officials plan to give hogs raised by the
corrections department a chance to pig out on 350 tons of crackers
that have been in storage 26 years.
   The Oklahoma City Emergency Management Department found the
crackers had not gone rancid, and began looking last month for ways
to get rid of them, said department administrator Donna Grant.
   She said the crackers no longer are tasty and have lost some
nutritional value.
   Corrections officials requested the crackers to feed the hogs.
The prison system slaughters about 4,400 swine each year, and uses
the pork to feed inmates.
   Ms. Grant said the city received several requests from private
farmers for the crackers, but ``there was really no fair and
operable way to offer them to individuals and organizations.''
   The 50,000 boxes of canned crackers will be hauled to the Jackie
Brannon Correctional Center in McAlester and mixed in with hog
feed, which will later be distributed to swine farms at other
prisons, officials said.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall; Dollar Rises On Tokyo Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices fell, while the dollar gained against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo trading Wednesday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
159.23 points Tuesday, closed at 27,799.67 for a loss of 120.28
points, or 0.43 percent.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar, which jumped over
the 134-yen level to start the day at 134.25 yen, closed at 134.30
yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday's close.
   The dollar was stronger despite of dollar-selling by the U.S.
central bank and several European banks aimed at curbing the
currency's recent rise, exchange dealers said.
   ``The yen's value fell because investors here sold yen to buy
government bonds, which led the dollar to jump up this morning,''
said a dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Traders at the Tokyo Stock Exchange said the market remained in
a wait-and-see mood following the Nikkei index's 159.23-point loss
on Tuesday.
   Some traders said the Tokyo markets were awaiting a scheduled
meeting Thursday of the West German Federal Reserve Bank, in light
of the mark's recent weakness against the dollar.
   ``Until investors find out what happens to interest rates in
West German banks on Aug. 25, the stock market is unlikely to be
active,'' the dealer said.

<HEAD>Death Toll at 749 In Quake</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHARAN, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud
houses today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed
at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid.
   Casualty reports continued to trickle in from remote parts of
this Himalayan mountain kingdom as relief workers fanned out
through the foothills and valleys. Sunday's pre-dawn quake struck
near the India-Nepal border.
   Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that followed the quake.
Others had cracks three feet deep or were blocked by boulders the
size of houses.
   At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa
of the Home Affairs Ministry. Dharan was hardest hit. At least 131
bodies were found in the city of 100,000.
   Indian officials have maintained since Monday that the death
toll in their country was 200 or less, but the figure was
questioned by opposition politicians, survivors and the local
media, including the Times of India, a newspaper that generally
supports the government.
   They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
   Indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake.
Nepalese officials listed 752 injured, down from their earlier
estimate of 1,000.
   In Bhaktapur, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in the
quake, 63-year-old Nhuchhe Raj Sakya said his five-story brick and
mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10
were still living in it.
   ``What else can we do?'' the goldsmith said. ``We have no tent.
How can I leave my place?''
   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan on
Tuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and
five-story houses.
   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha said
as he toured the town.
   Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain
at the base of a steep hill. Most of the victims died in their
houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had
loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
   Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished
more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation.
   ``We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied
(the ones remaining) are safe to live in,'' he said.
   Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the
government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes
were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors
or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
   The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep,
registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in
the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of
Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists'
accounts.
   Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumors of
an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the
streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan.
   The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by
word of mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing
people from their sleep.

   Three siblings whose parents have fought
with school officials since spring because the children were not
allowed to preach at the school gates will be taught at home, a
mediator says.
   ``We pretty much got what everybody wanted,'' said Dan Rodden,
president of Caleb Campaign of Chicago, a non-profit Christian
rights organization negotiating with school officials on the
family's behalf.
   Rodden said Tuesday that David and Robin Strode of McDowell
County had signed a statement asking that their children be removed
from Eastfield Elementary School and be taught at home.
   But the county school superintendent, David Ricketts, said he
was not sure an agreement had been reached.
   Who would teach the children and what arrangements would be made
were not disclosed to reporters. Strode, who is unemployed, said
his family could not afford to hire a teacher or to pay for at-home
instruction.
   Rodden said his organization would help with the education and
even help the 40-year-old Strode find a job.
   On Monday, the children's first day of school lasted less than a
minute, ending with 11-year-old Duffey being suspended for 10 days.
   Duffey, and his 6-year-old brother, Matthew, began shouting
Bible verses while at the gate and their 7-year-old sister, Pepper,
yelled ``Repent.''
   ``We were there to welcome them to school,'' said Eastwood
Principal Jim Gorst.
   ``Duffey stuck his Bible in my face and he said, `You go to
hell.'''
   The Strodes did not meet with school officials Tuesday but
allowed Rodden to shuttle between the school and the Strode home 1{
blocks away for negotiations.
   Richard Schwartz, an attorney for the North Carolina School
Boards Association, said he hoped to reach an agreement that would
result in both sides waiving the right to future litigation.
   Rodden, the superintendent and Schwartz met with Eastfield
Elementary Assistant Principal Shirley Ramsey and Assistant
Superintendent Shearon Crawford.Further meetings were planned for
today.
   Tuesday morning, Rodden said, he was ``working to save the
marriage'' between the children and the school. But by noon, he
said, ``I realized the marriage was unsavable and we went for a
divorce.''
   Although Rodden said the agreement satisfied everyone, Strode
left the house late in the day with his eyes red, apparently from
crying.
   ``As the world builds bigger and better schools and bigger and
better churches, the children are going to hell by the thousands,''
he said before turning away.
   The children were suspended repeatedly last spring when they
stood behind the school screaming Bible verses and refusing to
enter the building when asked.
   Their favorite verse is Hebrews 13:4: ``Marriage is honorable in
all and the bed undefiled. But whoremongers and fornicators God
will judge.''

   A Swiss doctor who had joined
leftist Salvadoran guerrillas was killed in a firefight with
government forces, the head of the military press office said
Tuesday.
   Dr. Jurg Dieter Weiss, 42, was one of three guerrillas killed
Monday in a clash with government troops near Ilobasco, Col.
Galileo Torres told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Ilobasco is 24 miles northeast of San Salvador.
   Torres said one Salvadoran solider was injured in the fight.
   He said the Red Cross and the Swiss Embassy have been advised of
Weiss' death, and that arrangements for transfering his body to
Switzerland were pending.

   The city's goats were doing their job
all right, but just couldn't seem to stay on the jobsite.
   City commissioners voted Monday to sell the three goats, who
have acted as living lawnmowers for grass near the city's sewage
treatment plant since July.
   Mayor John Littell said the goats were not being fired because
they did a bad job.
   ``They were eating the grass,'' he said.
   The fence surrounding the area was not in good enough condition
to contain the animals. When the fence is repaired next summer, the
city may purchase new goats, Littell said.
   For now, the goats probably will find a home with Archie Canon,
Cherryvale's dog catcher. Littell said Canon has made pets out of
the animals, and gets a gallon of milk a day.

   By day, Cecilia works as a hotel maid in Miami. But
when trouble brews, she's Poison.
   Marvel Comics has introduced a new superhero, Poison, who came
to Miami from Cuba during the Mariel boatlift and moved into the
tent city that briefly popped up under Interstate 95. She received
her powers when her alter-ego fell from another dimension and took
over part of her body.
   Poison, who made her debut in the ``Web of Spider-Man'' special
edition currently on sale, wears a webbed body suit and spiked
heels as she battles the sinister Slug, an obese villain who can
suffocate people in folds of flab.
   Marvel Editor Jim Salicrup said Poison will likely appear in
coming Marvel comics and could have her own series next year.

<HEAD>Arafat: PLO Will Pay Salaries Of Those Laid Off By Jordan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO says it will pay the salaries of
the more than 20,000 educational, health and administrative workers
in Israel's occupied lands who Jordan says it will no longer pay.
   But PLO leader Yasser Arafat, in a statement Tuesday, did not
say where the salaries would come from or how they would be paid.
   Jordan early this month announced it was letting go the 21,200
employees in phases, gradually eliminating payment of about $45
million in salaries a year.
   King Hussein said his decision to abandon his claim to the
occupied West Bank and to sever financial links with the Gaza Strip
was aimed at giving greater responsibilities to the PLO.
   ``The PLO shall shoulder full responsibility for the employees
and workers as regards rights entitled to them, salaries and wages,
on the basis of the regulations and lists of their appointments to
office,'' Arafat said in the statement, which was made available by
the PLO office in Nicosia.
   The statement was referring to the Jordanian government salary
scale, used to pay many of the employees who worked in schools,
hospitals, government offices and other institutions.
   Although Jordan laid off or retired the employees, Arafat said
they would remain in their current positions.
   The statement added that ``all law and regulations in force in
the occupied territories shall remain in force until such time as
they are amended or abrogated by the Palestinian legislative
authorities.''
   It did not elaborate. The PLO has been debating the possible
formation of a provisional government or government-in-exile for
the territories.
   In addition to severing administrative links to the territories,
Hussein canceled a $1.3 billion development plan for the
territories and dissolved the lower house of Parliament, half of
whose members were Palestinians.
   Jordan later announced it would issue temporary two-year
passports for West Bank residents that would no longer confer
Jordanian citizenship but could be used as travel documents.
   Hussein has said the changes are in response to the PLO's desire
to ``secede'' and form its own state with its heart in the West
Bank. The occupied territories have been wracked by an 8{-month-old
uprising against Israeli rule.
   The PLO has substantial, although largely secret, financial
resources provided by Arab countries and the Palestinian diaspora
outside the Arab world.
   Israeli leaders have vowed to prevent the PLO from taking over
any of the salaries or services on the West Bank and in the Gaza
Strip.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange lost ground today for the
third consecutive day, while the U.S. dollar edged up in trading on
the foreign exchange market to close at 134.30 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed 120.28 points, or 0.43
percent, to end at 27,299.67. The main market indicator had lost
130.24 points on Monday and another 159.23 points Tuesday.
   Although the Nikkei average quickly gained 55.40 points in early
morning trading to reach 27,975.35 points, share prices fell toward
the end of the afternoon.
   ``Share prices today were lower across the board,'' said a
dealer at a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``In addition to the strong wait-and-see mood among investors,
the protectionist U.S. trade bill just reported Tuesday led
investors to sell export-related issues, such as Toshiba and
Sony,'' he added.
   Other dealers said the stock market lacked energy because many
institutional investors were cautious ahead of West German banks'
scheduled decision on interest rates.
   Volume traded in the first section was 600 million shares, up
100 million shares from Tuesday.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened above the
134-yen level and never went lower. Opening at 134.25 yen, the U.S.
currency moved in a range of 134.17-134.70 yen to finish at 134.30,
up 0.37 yen from Tuesday's close.

<HEAD>South Korea Wants Fourth Round Of Talks Friday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea wants to resume talks
Friday with North Korea on a non-aggression pact and on the north's
demand to co-host the Olympic Games, officials said today.
   The National Assembly made the announcement after its senior
delegate, Rep. Park Joon-kyu, held a private meeting with his North
Korean counterpart, Chon Kum Chol, at the truce village of
Panmunjom.
   Park refused to disclose details of the private meeting. He said
the south's decision on resuming talks would be relayed to the
north.
   Assembly officials were reluctant to say whether they believed
the deadlocked talks, which began Friday and collapsed Monday,
could be revived. But one senior official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``Neither side wants to take the blame (for
breaking off the talks).''
   Although Park said he expected ``new proposals'' from North
Korea, he admitted he was not encouraged by North Korea's stand at
today's meeting.
   ``Isn't it meaningful that the talks would continue?'' he said
when asked about prospects of the upcoming meeting.
   Friday's meeting would be the fourth in talks between lawmakers
of the two Koreas on sharing the Olympics and various peace
measures, including a non-aggression pact.
   The talks ended in a stalemate on Monday, with both sides
failing to fix a date for further talks.
   South Korean delegates said after a third round of talks on
Monday that they hoped to postpone further contacts until after the
Olympics, scheduled for Sept. 17 through Oct. 2 in Seoul.
   North Korea called for urgent talks on the Olympics, but they
were not so enthusiastic in pursuing the subject. They seemed more
concerned about a non-aggression pact.
   In an effort to break the deadlock at Monday's meeting, South
Korea proposed a private meeting between the senior delegates of
the two sides. North Korea agreed to consider the suggesion.
   The talks were called to prepare for full-scale parliamentary
talks on North Korea's bid to co-host the Olympics, and on other
measures, including a non-aggression pact, to ease tension between
the nations.
   The two sides differed over an agenda and the size of the talks.
North Korea insists the main talks include the full legislatures of
both sides, involving nearly 1,000 members, but the south wants
delegations of up to 30 lawmakers from each side.
   North Korea also wants the two parliaments to publish a joint
declaration of non-aggression, which seeks, among other things, the
withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops in South Korea and nuclear
weapons allegedly in their arsenal.
   The south sees the U.S. forces as vital to its defenses against
the communist north.
   North Korea said it will boycott the Olympics unless it can
co-host them. The International Olympic Committee has rejected the
North Korean demand, saying the Olympics are given to a single city
and cannot be shared.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was
divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the Korean
War from 1950 to 1953.

   Dozens of television's new and old stars
celebrated 40 years of the prime time Emmy Awards, with the
festivities proving to be as much a party for NBC's celebrated
``L.A. Law.''
   Barbara Bain, Robert Cummings, George Gobel, Harvey Korman,
Edward James Olmos, Loretta Swit, John Ritter and Shelley Winters
were the former Emmy winners at Tuesday night's party.
   This year's awards presentation will be broadcast Sunday on the
Fox Television Network from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. in the Eastern and
Pacific time zones.
   Nominees who attended the party included ``thirtysomething's''
Tim Busfield, Tim Reid of ``Frank's Place,'' Ann Jillian, star of
``The Ann Jillian Story,'' and Larry Drake, Alan Rachins and
Michael Tucker of ``L.A. Law,'' whose 19 nominations were the most
this year.
   Tucker, who was nominated along with co-star and real-life wife
Jill Eikenberry, said: ``It's very nice that both of us got the
nomination. ... It really saves on wear and tear on the homefront.''
   Ms. Jillian, who starred in a movie chronicling her battle with
breast cancer, said her nomination has ``been really exciting for
me. ... I'm very happy for the entire experience.''
   Miss Bain, winner of three Emmys for her role on the 1960s hit
series ``Mission: Impossible,'' said she was unhappy the program
was being revived for ABC's fall season. The show, which highlights
the adventures of a government covert action team, was brought back
as a replacement series caused by writers strike delays.
   ``I think it's unfortunate the way (the revival) came about,''
Bain said. ``I hope they do it well.''

   Joan Kennedy received no special
treatment by being placed her on a year's probation and losing her
driver's license for 45 days for drunken driving, a prosecutor says.
   The 51-year-old former wife of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
also was ordered to pay $677 in fees and fines and to participate
in a state alcohol-education program.
   The penalty, imposed Tuesday by Barnstable District Court Judge
Joseph T. Travaline, was part of an agreement between the district
attorney's office and Mrs. Kennedy's attorney, Patrick Butler.
   At a brief hearing, Mrs. Kennedy acknowledged ``there are
sufficient facts for a finding of guilty. It's like offering no
defense,'' said Richard Piazza, assistant district attorney.
   Mrs. Kennedy told the court she had not been drinking in a
public place, but she was not asked to be more specific.
   A guilty finding was entered on her record, he said.
   ``I think it's safe to say there was no special treatment,''
Piazza said.
   Mrs. Kennedy, who lives in Boston and owns a house on Squaw
Island, was arrested July 5 after her car struck a fence. She was
not hurt.
   She was arrested after the police officer smelled alcohol on her
breath, and noticed that her eyes were bloodshot and glassy and
that she had trouble walking, according to a police report.
   Mrs. Kennedy surrendered her license following the accident
because she refused to take a breath test for alcohol. Refusal to
take the test carries a mandatory 120-day loss of license in
Massachusetts.

   A maintenance worker on Coney Island's Cyclone
roller coaster was taking a ride on his lunch break when he
wriggled free of the safety bar and stood up, causing him to fall
to his death, police said.
   Peter Ellis, 26, was alone in the last car when he fell Tuesday,
apparently ignoring signs that warn customers not to stand up, said
Detective Joseph McConville.
   ``This guy wanted to stand up and say `Hey!' I guess standing up
is a death wish,'' said James Huggins, an inspector for the
Department of Buildings' Elevator Division, which inspects
amusement rides.
   Ellis dropped about 30 feet and landed on a crosstie on a lower
portion of the ride's wooden track. He died instantly, authorities
said.
   Milt Berger, a spokesman for the Astroland Amusement Park, said
Ellis had asked for permission to take a lunchtime ride on the
61-year-old roller coaster, which was made a city landmark last
month.
   He fell off the ride as it began its 90-foot first drop, Berger
said.
   Each of the three cars is equipped with a heavy steel safety bar
that is locked on the outside before the ride begins, making it
difficult for the rider to stand up or be thrown out during the
ride, which twists and turns at nearly 70 mph, Berger said.
   ``It's impossible to get out, but he wiggled out, he was
standing, and he was thrown,'' Berger said, who added that the
death was not due to any mechanical failure of the ride.
   The death was the first fatality at the park in at least 25
years, said Jerry Albert, a co-owner of Astroland.

   State-run radio said Burma's leaders
lifted martial law in Rangoon today and ordered troops out of the
capital's center, where thousands of anti-government protesters
rallied for a third straight day.
   Japan's Kyodo news service said 200,000 people, including many
government officials and merchants, took part in demonstrations
that virtually shut down the city of 3.5 million people.
   Protest leaders called for a Friday rally in Rangoon to press
for an end to one-party rule in the isolated Southeast Asian nation.
   State-run Radio Rangoon, monitored in Bangkok, said President
Maung Maung signed a decree lifting martial law, which was slapped
on Rangoon Aug. 3 following anti-government demonstrations. The
order took effect at 1 p.m.
   An order signed by Brig. Gen. Myo Nyunt, the Rangoon area
commander, withdrew the military administration from the capital an
hour earlier, the radio said.
   A second presidential decree lifted martial law in the town of
Prome, about 150 miles north of Rangoon, Radio Rangoon said.
Martial law was imposed there July 22 after mobs destroyed houses
and shops.
   Demonstrators led by students and saffron-robed Buddhist monks
gathered in the morning outside Rangoon General Hospital, diplomats
and media accounts said. The hospital has been the main rallying
site since troops shot medical personnel there earlier this month.
   Kyodo said some protesters drove cars through the city and
called on people to join the peaceful rally and march. They shouted
``Down with Dictatorship!'' and ``We only need Democracy!'' Kyodo
said.
   Many shops were shuttered, the agency said. No violence was
reported.
   Hundreds of thousands of people across Burma took to the streets
from Aug. 8 to Aug. 12 to protest the transfer of power from
strongman Ne Win to hard-liner Sein Lwin, widely hated in Burma for
ruthlessly suppressing dissent.
   Clashes with security forces left, by official count, 112 people
dead and 267 wounded in Rangoon alone. But diplomats say hundreds
of people may have died in the protests before Sein Lwin's
resignation Aug. 12 after just 17 days in power.
   Amnesty International charged Tuesday that Burmese troops killed
at least 1,000 demonstrators during the unrest. Citing reliable
reports, the human rights organizaton said soldiers killed up to
3,000 demonstrators, mostly unarmed and peaceful.
   Soldiers repeatedly fired into unarmed peaceful crowds and at
protesters who turned violent when the student-led unrest peaked,
Amnesty said in a report out of Geneva.
   Students have mounted demonstrations in Rangoon almost daily
since they spearheaded the rioting that led to Sein Lwin's
resignation.
   On Tuesday night, the government acknowledged the most recent
protests for the first time.
   The broadcast monitored in Bangkok said security forces in
Moulmein, 45 miles southeast of Rangoon, fired on demonstrators who
drove four vehicles at them Monday night. It did not say if anyone
was injured.
   The report said demonstrators also looted and destroyed a
customs warehouse there Tuesday, sank a motorboat and fled with the
agents' weapons. Sunday night, protesters destroyed a government
building in Sandoway, 95 miles northwest of Rangoon.
   It also reported demonstrations in Rangoon, the northern city of
Mandalay, and Meiktila south of Mandalay, but gave no crowd
estimates. Kyodo said about 200,000 people demonstrated in
Mandalay, the country's second-largest city.
   Maung Maung, 63, is Burma's first civilian leader since Ne Win's
1962 military coup replaced democracy with rigid socialist
one-party rule.
   The new government has freed more than 600 people arrested
during the earlier rioting. But several prominent figures rounded
up last month in Rangoon still are held. They include Aung Gyi,
Burma's leading dissident, and Sein Win, the Burma correspondent of
The Associated Press.
   An Asian diplomat said today the daughter of slain Gen. Aung
San, a leader in the struggle for independence from Britain, called
for a united front against the government and a rally of 1 million
people Friday to demand full democracy.
   The daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, lives in Cambridge, England but
is visiting her mother in Rangoon. The diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the rally was planned for an athletic
field in Rangoon. He did not elaborate.

   Flash-flood warnings were posted in mountain and desert sections
of California and Arizona today after monsoonal showers and
thunderstorms closed roads and overturned trucks and parked
airplanes.
   ``This is worse than when it snowed'' last Christmas, police Lt.
Richard Miranda said in Tucson, Ariz., as emergency workers
grappled with weather-related problems Tuesday.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell today from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the Tennessee Valley, and rain fell along the
East Coast from southern New England to the Carolinas.
   The storms in the Southwest on Tuesday brought heavy rain and
strong, gusty winds to parts of Arizona and California. Winds
peaked at 64 mph in Tucson, and 1{ inches of rain fell in just half
an hour in Ehrenburg near the California line.
   In Arizona, a Tucson man and his stepson were stranded in the
middle of the swollen Santa Cruz River until a Department of Public
Safety helicopter rescued them, authorities said.
   At Tucson International Airport, the storm overturned two small
planes, broke winds and propellers on three large cargo planes and
blew off hangar roofs and doors, said spokeswoman Vicki Mathews.
Damage was estimated at $750,000. The storm also downed trees and
power lines.
   In Southern California, strong winds overturned three trucks and
closed Interstate 10. Flooding closed Highway 95 from Needles to
the Nevada line about 20 miles to the north.
   Storms in Texas on Tuesday dropped one-inch hail on Beaverdams
and generated winds that downed trees near Clarksville and Maud.
   In the Pacific Northwest, hot weather melted high-temperature
records for the date. It was 102 degrees in Salem, Ore., where the
old record of 96 was set in 1934. Records also fell in Portland and
Eugene, Ore., and at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the mountains and deserts of the Southwest, with storms most
numerous over Arizona, and from east Texas to the Gulf Coast
states, Florida and the Atlantic Coast, with rain widespread from
eastern Virginia to New England.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 80s and 90s across
much of the nation, the 60s over New England and Upper Michigan,
the 70s from Minnesota to Lower Michigan and the Middle Atlantic
States, the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast, near 100 degrees
in central Texas, the central valleys of California and inland
Oregon and Washington state; and between 100 and 110 across the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Houlton, Maine, to 90 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>Miners Go On Strike in Hungary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 150 coal miners were on strike
in southern Hungary today, and many more miners were joining the
stoppage, official reports said. Reports on strikes in communist
Hungary are rare.
   The state news agency MTI said the stoppage near the town of
Pecs was over wages and had ``no political undertones.''
   It said a senior official from Budapest had gone to the Mecsek
coal mines near Pecs, just north of the Yugoslav border, to mediate
the dispute.
   The official, Laszlo Kapolyi, returned to Budapest today with
representatives from the miners' management and the work force to
negotiate with the government over wage grievances, MTI said.
   Laszlo Kovacs, head of the official mineworkers' union, was also
said to be taking part in the negotations. In media discussions in
recent months, he has criticized management of the mining industry.
   The relatively swift reporting of the stoppage appeared to
reflect the greater openness seen in the state-run media since
Karoly Grosz took over as Communist party leader and head of a
reform-minded Politburo in May.
   MTI said trouble started Tuesday evening when 150 miners refused
to start work on the evening shift. Budapest radio said ``many
more'' joined the strikers today, but it gave no numbers.
   The strikes came at a time of widespread labor unrest in Poland,
where coal miners, dockworkers and transit workers have gone on
strike to demand reinstatement of Solidarity, the only independent
labor federation ever allowed in the Soviet bloc.
   MTI said the workers in Pecs were complaining that the new
personal income tax introduced in Hungary on Jan. 1 has cut their
bonuses by up to one-third.
   ``It is especially irritating for the miners that miners on sick
leave often earn more than their colleagues on regular shifts,''
MTI said, describing this as ``another unwelcome byproduct of the
recently introduced personal income tax.''
   Radio Budapest said in its morning broadcast that miners were
also complaining that unspecified legitimate demands had not been
met ``for years'' and that other unspecified steps were taken
``over their heads.''
   The manager of the mine was said by the radio to have expressed
sympathy for the miners' grievances. One miner was quoted as
saying, ``We are seeking a solution of our problems. If that is
impossible, we accept the closure of the mine. But the present
situation must be changed.''
   Hungary's official trade unions have been highly critical of
recent economic policy, emphasizing that workers, pensioners and
the unemployed must be protected against price rises caused by
government efforts to curb the $18 billion foreign debt and
stimulate the stagnating economy.
   MTI said the mine management had promised to return to Pecs from
Budapest tonight to report on the outcome of negotiations in
Budapest with Industry Minister Frigyes Berecz and other government
officials.

   The Kremlin says it is watching with concern the
situation in Poland, but it has not issued any official comment on
an 8-day-old strike wave in the Soviet Union's western neighbor.
   Soviet media today issued reports on a meeting of the Polish
Communist Party's Politburo, but offered no commentary.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, at a regular
news briefing Tuesday, said, ``We closely follow the situation in
Poland.''
   ``We are, of course, very attentive and interested and we are
concerned by the events of Poland,'' he said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass quoted a statement by the Polish
Politburo saying that difficult living conditions and justified
criticism of authorities were not acceptable reasons for the
strikes plaguing the Soviet-bloc country.
   The strikes are the worst labor unrest in Poland since 1981,
when the Warsaw government stifled the Solidarity free trade union
movement with a military crackdown.
   ``Economic damage is piling up. Poland's prestige and economic
confidence in Poland in international relations suffered
substantially,'' the Tass report said of the current strikes.
   It reported that the Politburo approved a letter to party
members calling on them to counter the strikes.
   Asked if the strikes in Poland and protests Sunday in
Czechoslovakia on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion
of that country helped Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
opponents find fault with his policy of greater openness, Gerasimov
said, ``I think you can find ammunition in any event.''

<HEAD>Asteroid Named After Russian Poet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pravda said today that a distant asteroid has been
named after Anna Akhmatova, one of Russia's favorite 20th century
poets. Her work was barred from publication during most of her life.
   The Communist Party newspaper said Soviet scientists requested
that the International Planetary Center in the United States grant
the name in honor of the poet's 100th birthday.
   Akhmatova was born in 1889 and gained fame for her works,
inspired by the style of Alexander Pushkin, before the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   Her husband, fellow poet Nicholas Gumilev, was executed by the
Bolsheviks in 1921, and officials frowned upon her work from then
until 1940. She was rehabilitated during World War II, but lost
favor again in 1946 and was expelled from the Soviet Writers Union
for ``bourgeois decadence.''
   Akhmatova was reinstated in 1959 and died seven years later.
   Her works are in great demand in the Soviet Union, where poetry
is a popular art form.

   George Bush says he's standing firm behind running mate Dan
Quayle despite ``insidious rumormongers'' raising questions about
the Indiana senator's character, as Democrat Michael Dukakis aimed
some of the harshest criticism yet at his Republican opponent.
   Vice President Bush complained during a Western campaign swing

running mate was drowning out the issues.
   The Republican presidential candidate declared that his campaign

   Riot police smashed barricades to break up
a strike at a coal mine and cleared strikers from an idled bus
depot today, opposition sources said. Still, more than a dozen
enterprises remained on strike.
   Confronted by an 8-day-old strike wave posing the stiffest
challenge to its rule since 1981, the Politburo called on Communist
Party members ``to counter attempts to stir illegal strikes,'' the
state-run news agency PAP reported.
   The stoppages have idled plants employing about 100,000 workers
to press demands for legalization of the Solidarity free trade
union movement, reinstatement of workers fired for union activity
and wage increases.

   A U.S. appeals court struck down new
guidelines establishing a range of sentences for federal crimes,
ruling the standards are unconstitutional because they were drafted
by judges as a political act.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the highest court to rule
on the issue, said Tuesday that placing three federal judges on the
seven-member sentencing commission violated constitutional
separation of powers.
   In a 2-1 vote, the court decided the use of judges on the
commission interfered with the ``aura of judicial impartiality'' by
allowing the president to appoint and remove members, said the
opinion by Judge Alex Kozinski.

   A group of weary Iowa farmers who traveled
1,600 miles for free hay have found an abundance of assistance
here, making it likely they will have enough equipment to cut the
fodder they need for their drought-starved livestock.
   ``It's farmers helping farmers and I guess that's how to sum it
up,'' said Norman Plank, an Idaho Farm Bureau official who greeted
the tired contingent of 65 Iowans upon their arrival Tuesday night
after a 38-hour bus trip.
   Organizers of the hay harvest had been worried that because of a
potential snag in obtaining the farming equipment, there wouldn't
be enough machinery to keep the Iowans busy when they began working
today.
   But offers of free equipment to cut the thousands of tons of hay
for shipment east by Burlington Northern Railroad began pouring
into the Farm Bureau office in Moscow on Tuesday after Plank
appealed on television for donations.

<HEAD>Movie Company Withdraws Request To Film In Long House Ruin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hopi Indian tribe's religious beliefs have
accomplished what giant spiders, ancient booby-traps, murder-minded
ruffians and supernatural events failed to do _ halt the movie
adventurer Indiana Jones.
   Lucasfilm Ltd., maker of the Indiana Jones movies starring
Harrison Ford, has withdrawn its request to film in the Long House
Ruin mud and sandstone cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde National Park.
   ``We discovered that this was holy ground to the Hopi Indians,''
Frank Marshall, an executive producer for the film company, said
Tuesday. ``We feel we have to respect their heritage and ancestors,
and we have elected not to shoot there.''
   The company had sought permission to film chase sequences there
next month. The idea met with an outcry from conservationists who
feared damage to the fragile 700-year-old ruins. In addition, actor
Jon Voight carried the religious objections of Hopi tribal elders
to Lucasfilm executives, Marshall said.
   ``He happens to know us and came over to set the record
straight, to make sure that we knew this. We immediately took
action on it,'' Marshall said.
   Marshall said the film company hopes to shoot the scenes in
Arizona.
   The as yet-untitled sequel to ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' is about ``pot hunters''
who raid ruins in search of artifacts and treasure.
   Mesa Verde's chief archeologist had concluded the filming could
damage the dwellings once inhabited by Anasazi Indians, but
Lorraine Mintzmyer, Southwest regional director of the National
Park Service, overruled that, saying shooting would be supervised
carefully.
   The tribe's cultural preservation officer, Eric Polingyouma,
said he was glad Lucasfilm withdrew. ``All of those places where
our clans had settled, these have become a complex shrine system
for us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Security Tightened As Moslems Mark Holy Day A Week After Zia Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government tightened security in
several cities today to prevent sectarian strife among Moslems
observing a solemn holy day one week after the death of President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Pakistan's Shiites, a Moslem sect that constitutes about 5
percent of the country's 107 million people, joined processions
through the streets of villages and cities to mourn the death of
the prophet Mohammed's grandson, Imam Hussain. Participants beat or
flog themselves to show devotion to the martyr.
   Sectarian friction between the Shiites and the majority Sunnis
typically increases on Ashoura, the holiday marking Imam Hussain's
death that concludes today. Hussain and a group of followers were
massacred in 680 in what is now the Iraqi province of Karbala in a
leadership fight between Moslem factions. Moslems later formed the
Shiite and Sunni sects of the faith.
   Since the assassination three weeks ago of a Shiite religious
leader in northwestern Pakistan, tension has increased between
Shiites and Sunnis, and authorities feared the observance could
lead to violence. Zia was a Sunni.
   In the southern port of Karachi, as many as 40,000 Shiites
marched through the main district in observance of the holiday.
   About 20,000 police, paramilitary units and army regulars
dressed in full battle gear lined the streets along the procession.
They drove vehicles mounted with machine guns and kept watch from
rooftops along the seven-mile route. No clashes were reported.
   About 30 people have died this year in Sunni-Shiite gunbattles
in northern Pakistan. New clashes were reported in the region after
Zia died Aug. 17 in a plane crash.
   The English-language newspaper The Muslim reported Tuesday that
at least 10 people died and 10 were injured the last few days in
Shiite-Sunni violence near Kohat, about 100 miles west of Islamabad.
   Pakistani officials say they believe Zia's plane crash was a
result of sabotage but have not said who they think is responsible.
Some officials have hinted at agents of Afghanistan's pro-Soviet
government.
   Pakistan, like the United States, supports the guerrillas trying
to overthrow the Afghan government.
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said Tuesday that Pakistan's
intelligence services received information her life was in danger
following Zia's death.
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the country's largest opposition party,
the Pakistan People's Party, said she was informed Tuesday that the
government had posted armed guards outside her home.
   ``They informed me that they had received some threats so they
wanted to post some guards,'' she said in an interview with The
Associated Press at her home in Karachi. ``They told my secretary,
`We used to follow her for intelligence purposes but now we'll
follow her to guard her.'''
   Ms. Bhutto said she had no other details.
   Ms. Bhutto said she was seeking to form alliances with other
opposition groups and reach agreements to prevent them competing
for the same National Assembly seats in Nov. 16 elections.
   She strongly criticized the current Cabinet, calling the
ministers ``dangerous'' holdovers from Zia's regime. Thirteen of
the 16 ministers were appointed by Zia.
   She called on new President Ishaq Khan to appoint a caretaker
government until elections. She expressed confidence that if
elections were conducted fairly she would win.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Prepares For Direct Iran-Iraq Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.N. secretary-general met a senior
International Red Cross official today to prepare for direct
Iran-Iraq peace talks and one of the negotiation's thorniest
issues: repatriation of war prisoners.
   Security Council Resolution 598 urges release and repatriation
of prisoners of war without delay after a cease-fire. Hostilities
were halted one week ago, and U.N. peacekeeping forces took up
positions along the Iran-Iraq border.
   Maj. Gen. Slavko Jovic, the head of the U.N. forces, said the
cease-fire was holding, despite minor problems over troop
movements, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said today
in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   In Geneva, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his
Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, were to arrive today for
face-to-face talks, set to begin with Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar on Thursday afternoon.
   The talks will mark the first direct discussions by top Iranian
and Iraqi envoys since the Persian Gulf war began in 1980. The
U.N.-sponsored talks are aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace
settlement of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Perez de Cuellar has said he expects the talks to be long and
difficult, lasting at least several months. The atmosphere
surrounding the negotiations is bitter because of charges and
countercharges of truce violations.
   The agenda was not disclosed, and Francois Giuliani, spokesman
for the U.N. chief, told reporters today there is no time limit on
the talks. However, he said the secretary-general must return to
New York for the opening of the General Assembly on Sept. 20 and
may have to shift the talks to New York.
   In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Perez de Cuellar
said in Geneva that it was difficult to predict how long the peace
talks might take.
   ``It all depends on the political will of the parties,'' he said
in today's editions of the newspaper. ``If they really want to
resolve the problem, it could take only a few months. If not, it
could drag on for years and I would then name a personal
representative to follow the negotiations.''
   The U.N. chief will meet separately with Aziz and Velayati
Thursday morning and will be present when the two envoys meet in
the afternoon in the Council Chamber at the headquarters of the
former League of Nations, Giuliani said.
   The secretary-general will be present during all meetings
between the envoys during the first phase of discussions.
   Perez de Cuellar met today with Cornelio Sommaruga, president of
the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, to discuss
the problem of repatriating prisoners of war.
   Perez de Cuellar says both sides hold about 80,000 POWs,
including more than 50,000 captured by Iran. Many of the prisoners
reportedly have rejected repatriation, called for under a U.N.
peace plan. Red Cross officials say they must interview each
prisoner to determine his wishes before arranging a return.
   Resolution 598, the U.N. peace plan, calls for a cease-fire,
early troop withdrawal to international boundaries and repatriation
of prisoners of war. It also calls on both sides to cooperate with
the U.N. chief in reaching ``a comprehensive, just and honorable
settlement'' of all outstanding issues.
   The long-term agenda for the talks also is expected to cover a
border dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only access
to the gulf and establishment of a commission to determine which
side started the war. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after
border shelling by Iran and a history of hostilities between the
Arab and the Persian nations.
   Earlier today, an Iraqi oil tanker passed through the Strait of
Hormuz, the first since the Iran-Iraq war began, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported. The strait is the narrow body of water at the
southern end of the Persian Gulf.
   The Ain Zalah, carrying a load of Iraqi crude oil, was the third
Iraqi vessel to sail into the gulf since the cease-fire went into
effect.

<TEXT>
   A treasure-hunter who has spent three
years diving for riches from a Spanish galleon lost in a 1715
hurricane says a find of 900 silver coins has pointed him in the
direction of the mother lode.
   ``It was a very good sign as far as letting us know we're going
in the right direction. Who knows what's ahead now. We're very
excited about that,'' Roy Volker said Tuesday.
   The 63-year-old explorer from St. Louis hopes to find $200
million in gold that went down with the Nuestra Senora de la Regla,
the flagship of an eight-galleon fleet that left Vera Cruz, Mexico,
for Spain in July 1715.
   In addition to the coins, the ship yielded two gold rings, a
small silver statue of an angel holding a Christ child, several
shoe buckles, pottery and other artifacts.
   Volker estimated the value of the find, his largest, at
$250,000. However, a spokeswoman for treasure hunter Mel Fisher,
who owns the wreck, said the coins alone could be worth $400 to
$500 each, for a total of between $360,000 and $450,000.
   Twenty percent of the treasure and artifacts will go to the
state and an undisclosed percentage to Fisher.
   ``We've been expecting to find a pretty good, sizable pile of
coins somewhere along the line,'' said Volker, who made the find a
few hundred yards off Sebastian Inlet.
   ``We know there's a lot of treasure on the ship that's never
been found,'' he added.
   Carrying a cargo of treasure for the Spanish crown, the ships
were struck by a hurricane and sank along the central Atlantic
coast of Florida, killing 700 people.
   The Regla was smashed and its treasure strewn along the sandy
coast and buried by subsequent storms and tides, making its
discovery difficult, said Bleth McHaley, spokeswoman for Fisher's
company.
   Between 1964 and 1970, Fisher and his partners took about $20
million in treasure from the site, Ms. McHaley said.

   Quiron Clinic spokeswoman Inmaculada Cuenca said the 88-year-old
Spanish-born musician, who is credited with introducing tropical

hospital bed.
   She said doctors had placed him in an intensive care unit but
hoped to move him to a regular unit later today if his condition
continued to improve.
   When he arrived at the hospital emergency room, Cugat told
doctors he was having difficulty breathing, Ms. Cuenca said.
   In his report, Dr. Jorge Ruis said the band leader was suffering
from ``a problem in the left ventricle probably secondary to a
respiratory infection.''
   Cugat and his family left his native Gerona, north of Barcelona,
for Cuba when he was four. He later became a U.S. citizen.
   The band leader gave up a 50-year band career in 1970 and handed
over his orchestra to Tito Puente.
   Ten years later, Cugat returned to Spain, where he was born Jan.
1, 1900. Since returning to the Barcelona area, Cugat has suffered
four heart attacks and a severe stroke. He was hospitalized in
February for lung congestion.

<TEXT>
   A three-year undercover operation has
resulted in charges against 43 people accused of poaching black
bears for their gall bladders, which are prized in Asia as
aphrodisiacs and medicine.
   The federal-state probe was sparked by the danger poaching poses
to the nation's black bear population, Gary Myers, executive
director of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, said Tuesday
in announcing the charges.
   During the investigation, agents bought 266 gall bladders, 85
claws, 77 feet, four heads, nine hides and one live black bear cub,
officials said.
   Among the items displayed at a news conference Tuesday were
several plastic bags containing a bear's gall bladder, which
resembles a swollen, heavily veined lima bean.
   The parts were sold to Asians in the United States and overseas,
said Tim Hergenrader of the Tennessee wildlife agency. He said the
gall bladder is dried and ground into a powder thought to be good
for health and an aphrodisiac.
   Bear claws are used to make jewelry, and heads are used as
trophies, Hergenrader said.
   Arrest warrants were issued in Knoxville, Asheville, N.C., and
Atlanta for residents of the three states, and agents began making
arrests early Tuesday.
   Hergenrader said the 43 people were charged with more than 130
federal and state violations.
   Officials estimate the black bear population in the southern
Appalachians at about 2,000. The bears already are threatened by a
loss of habitat. Areas in public land are set aside as bear habitat
where hunting is prohibited.
   Hergenrader said some of the bears were legitimately killed, but
he said it is illegal to sell any part of a bear no matter how or
where it is killed.
   Myers said studies of the black bears indicated that ``we were
driving our black bear population to extinction'' and that poaching
accounted for half or more of the annual bear deaths.
   He described the poachers as ``a loose, informal network of
people who knew who you needed to see if you want bear gall
bladders.''

<HEAD>American Accused Of Terrorism Freed From Prison, Leaves Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American accused of helping leftist
guerrillas mount a terrorist attack left Peru after spending nearly
five months in prison.
   Cynthia McNamara, 40, a native of Philadelphia, flew out of Lima
on Tuesday for Shannon, Ireland, after being freed from prison. The
U.S. Embassy issued a statement expressing approval that she was
released.
   On April 26, a Lima court cleared her of charges she took part
in an attack by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas that left two people
dead. She was rearrested on the same charges Aug. 2 and was held in
prison until Monday night.
   Her departure followed a tense hour at Lima's international
airport during which the embassy sent word that Peru was refusing
to allow her to travel anywhere but to the United States, her
lawyers said.
   One of her attorneys, Jose Burneo, said the embassy and former
Mayor Alfonso Barrantes of Lima made phone calls to Peruvian
officials ``at the highest levels'' to gain approval for her
departure.
   About 20 friends and reporters witnessed her departure at 5:15
p.m. aboard a Soviet Aeroflot flight. ``My name is cleared. I feel
relieved,'' she said.
   Ms. McNamara was first arrested Dec. 5 in Ayacucho state, 225
miles southeast of Lima, while she was on a trip through Peru and
Chile as a tourist.
   She was charged with taking part in a guerrilla attack in August
1987 in Vilcashuaman in Ayacucho in which two government employees
were slain.
   Ms. McNamara was released from prison in April after the Lima
court cleared her of the charges. Her attorneys and the U.S.
Embassy said two survivors of the attack in Vilcashuaman testified
she was not among the assailants. Other witnesses said she was in
Puquio, 90 miles south of Vilcashuaman, when the attack occurred.
   Lima Superior Court upheld the ruling on July 13 and Ms.
McNamara began making arrangements to leave Peru. She was
rearrested on an outstanding warrant stemming from the Vilcashuaman
attack when she appeared at a Lima police station on Aug. 2 to get
approval to depart.
   She spent the next three weeks in prison as her attorneys fought
to prevent her transfer to Cangallo, the province in Ayacucho state
where Vilcashuaman is located. Her release came after an Ayacucho
court ruled Monday that she could not be tried twice for the same
crime, Burneo said.
   Ms. McNamara said she would go to London and meet friends before
seeking a job teaching English ``somewhere in Europe.'' She
reiterated her innocence to reporters Tuesday. She has frequently
disavowed any ties with the Shining Path.

Criticism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JELAZOUN, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army today demolished
three homes belonging to Palestinians who allegedly killed an Arab
collaborator and Israel sharply rejected U.S. criticism of its
deportation policy.
   Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began a
two-day general strike to protest the deaths of four Arabs in
Israeli prisons.
   John Whitehead, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, urged Israel
to reconsider its policy of deporting Palestinian activists and
said continued expulsions would damage relations between the two
countries.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry today responded: ``Israel does not
accept the American interpretation of international law regarding
deportations. ... The legality of deportations was checked recently
by Israel's Supreme Court, which ruled that deportations are legal,
according to both Israeli and international law.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also explained Israel's policy on
deportations in a 90-minute meeting today with U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering, said Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner.
   Pickering refused to answer reporters' questions about the
meeting, and Pazner refused to elaborate.
   Israel has deported 33 Palestinians since the Palestinian
uprising began Dec. 8. Last week, 25 more were ordered expelled.
   Whitehead's statement marked the first time the U.S. has warned
that Israel's policies in the territories could threaten relations.
   The Haaretz and Jerusalem Post dailies said Whitehead spoke to
Israeli Charge d'Affaires Oded Eran in a meeting in Washington
Tuesday. An Israeli source in Washington confirmed the meeting.
   ``Whitehead's statement was sharp. I don't see it as an
ultimatum, but they definitely want us to stop the deportations,''
former Foreign Ministry director David Kimche told army radio.
   Israel has said it uses the measure ``only as a last resort''
and calls it an acceptable means of deterring violence.
   The latest strike was called in a leaflet issued Tuesday by
pro-PLO underground leaders of the uprising, who also urged
solidarity with 5,000 Arab prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails.
   In Jelazoun, a refugee camp of 5,000 north of Jerusalem,
soldiers ordered a curfew after destroying homes belonging to three
alleged members of grassroots committees that Israel outlawed last
week.
   The three allegedly beat an Arab youth to death while
interrogating him about suspected collaboration with Israel.
   An AP reporter saw two army jeeps blocking the entrance of the
camp. The streets were virtually empty.
   The pre-dawn demolition came several hours before 14 U.S.
Congressional aides were scheduled to visit the camp on a tour
organized by the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, soldiers rounded up six
Palestinians suspected of belonging to the Palestine Liberation
Organization's mainstream Fatah faction, the army said.
   The suspects were accused of hurling three firebombs at Israeli
and Arab targets and throwing an explosive at an Israeli bus, the
army said. A bomb with a chemical charge was found in their
possession, it said.
   The general strike paralyzed transportation and commerce in at
least six major cities in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   In Hebron, Bethlehem and Gaza City, some Palestinians violated
the strike, the third in four days. Some shops were open and taxis
transported some workers to Israel.
   Masked Arab youths pelted rocks at some of the cars along a
five-mile strip connecting Bethlehem to Jerusalem.
   The latest strike was called to honor ``martyrs behind bars,''
including two Palestinians shot to death in a prison riot last week
and two who the army and police said committed suicide within the
last month.
   Relatives said one of those said to have committed suicide,
Nadil Mustafa Beduah of east Jerusalem, had his teeth knocked out
and several ribs fractured before his death.
   At least 252 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in
the 8{-month-old uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip against
21 years of Israeli occupation.

<TEXT>
   A foam producer has agreed to pay a record
$700,000 in civil penalties to settle what is believed to be the
first lawsuit in the nation filed by a state to stop emissions
suspected of depleting the ozone layer.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon announced terms of
the settlement Tuesday and said the company, PI Inc. of Hyannis,
also agreed to end its emissions by year's end.
   The settlement must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
handling PI's reorganization and by Superior Court, where the suit
was filed.
   The state accused PI with emitting 1,300 tons of
chlorofluorocarbons a year in violation of state regulations. CFCs
are a class of chemicals implicated in the decline of the ozone
layer that protects Earth from solar radiation.
   The compounds are manmade chemicals used to create plastic
foams, for cleaning electronic parts and for refrigeration. The
chemicals were also used as propellants in aerosol cans until
banned by the federal government in 1978.
   ``Our action demonstrates that we can make a difference in
protecting the Earth's fragile environment,'' Shannon said. ``CFCs
have been directly linked to the destruction of the ozone layer and
consequently pose a threat to the Earth's survival.''
   The attorney general's office found no record of any other state
filing such a suit, said Shannon spokeswoman Mary Breslauer.
   Telephone calls to PI's president and attorney were not
immediately returned.
   Shortly before the attorney general filed suit in June, PI filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code. According to news accounts, the company's insurer
had become insolvent, leaving PI with no protection from numerous
product liability suits.
   Daniel Greenbaum, commissioner of the state's top environmental
enforcement agency, said the resolution marks the first success by
the state Department of Environmental Quality Engineering in its
effort to stop unregulated emissions of CFCs.

   Up to $1 million in Asian artwork stolen from
The Walters Art Gallery has been discovered in a museum guard's
basement, authorities say.
   Gregory Bartgis, 30, a museum security supervisor, was arrested
at his home Tuesday, said FBI agent James Dearborn.
   Bartgis was charged today with theft, punishable by up to 15
years in prison, said police Lt. Lawrence Leeson. Federal charges
were not filed because the items did not leave the state, the FBI
said. A bail hearing was expected later today.
   All 81 items reported stolen from the gallery Aug. 16 appear to
have been recovered, said Joseph Corless, agent in charge of the
FBI office in Baltimore.
   ``It looks like we've recovered all the items, plus some
additional items we located that hadn't been reported stolen as
yet,'' said Leeson.
   The artwork includes jade, Chinese snuff bottles, figurines,
incense burners, boes and an 18-inch porcelain vase dating to the
18th century known as the Peach Bloom Vase. The pieces were valued
at between $500,000 and $1 million.
   Law enforcement agents found the art in boxes in Bartgis'
basement, Leeson said. None of the artifacts appeared to have been
sold, he said.
   The theft from at least 13 plexiglass display cases on the
museum's fourth floor was discovered after the curator returned
from vacation. Other pieces in the cases had been rearranged to
hide the theft, a museum spokesman said.
   The theft was ``very sophisticated and well planned'' and
obvious only to those who knew the collection well, museum
spokesman Howard White said last week. Officials said Tuesday the
theft appeared to be the work of one person.
   Law enforcement officials primarily investigated museum
employees, said Leeson, who would not reveal why suspicion fell on
Bartgis, a museum employee for 1{ years. The FBI administered
polygraph tests to museum employees.
   ``We feel extraordinarily relieved that these treasures that
belong to everybody in Baltimore are back,'' said Robert P.
Bergman, director of the city-owned gallery.
   The Asian art was bequeathed to the city by railroad magnate
Henry Walters in 1931. The Peach Bloom Vase was purchased by
Walters' father for $18,000 in 1886 and is one of the finest
examples of that type of glaze in Chinese porcelain, Bergman said.
   The insurer of the artworks, Lloyd's of London, had offered a
$100,000 reward for information leading to their recovery.

   New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan today
called for common rules and definitions of insider trading among
world stock markets.
   Different rules and definitions of illegal dealing is hindering
control of unscrupulous trading practices in the increasingly
borderless equity markets worldwide, the chief of the leading U.S.
exchange told reporters.
   ``Everybody comes from different culture and corporate
background. But the users of those markets have to see those
markets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work in
them,'' Phelan said at the Foreign Correspondent Club of Japan.
   He urged each market to spell out its definition of insider
trading, then work together to set up common rules.
   ``Within the market place, everybody talks the same language.
But if it is perceived by any major participant that the market is
unfair, there will be a lack of use of the market and that will be
detrimental to everybody.''
   Phelan criticized the Japanese approach as ``a narrow
interpretation,'' but he declined to assess recent measures by
Japanese securities authorities. ``Their needs are different from
our needs,'' he said.
   Several cases of what Western finance experts charge are insider
trading deals _ buying and selling securities based on information
not available to all _ are raising questions in Japan's financial
community about the ethics of Japanese stock deals.
   In the most prominent case, several politicians' aides and
senior journalists admitted buying stock of a real estate concern
before the issues were made public, and making huge profits by
selling the shares after they were listed.

   A bomb exploded outside a
Wimpy hamburger restaurant today, causing minor damage but no
injuries, police said.
   Three other Wimpy restaurants have been bombed since 1986,
including one on Tuesday.
   Police said the latest blast, in the farming and mining town of
Standerton east of Johannesburg, was caused by a limpet mine placed
in a travel bag. Officers were alerted by a passer-by and moved the
bag away from the restaurant into the middle of a cordoned-off
street before it exploded, police said.
   On Tuesday, 23 people were hurt when a limpet mine exploded at a
Wimpy restaurant in the coastal city of East London. A Wimpy outlet
in Johannesburg was bombed in June 1986 and one in nearby Benoni
was bombed last month.
   Police have blamed the attacks, as well as other recent
bombings, on the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement. The ANC said last week that some civilian targets had
been attacked by guerrillas acting against instructions to hit only
government-related facilities.
   There has been no public explanation why Wimpy restaurants have
become a repeated target of bombs.
   The company's managing director, Vincent Hays, said after
Tuesday's bombing that police had been asked to help improve
security at the restaurants.

<TEXT>
   One of the Soviet Union's largest newspapers today
detailed an accord that led to the 1940 takeover of three Baltic
republics. The report appeared one day after hundreds of thousands
of residents protested the pact.
   The full-page article in Sovietskaya Rossiya, the newspaper of
the Russian republic, provided the first opportunity for many
Soviets to learn details of the agreement between Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union.
   In the last two weeks, papers in the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia also have published details of the
agreement, and on Tuesday people jammed parks and public squares to
mark the 49th anniversary of its signing.
   Many Baltic people are seeking greater independence from Moscow
for their relatively advanced and westward-looking economies, and
some radicals are agitating for independence.
   The small countries were independent after the Bolshevik
Revolution of 1917 until they were added to the Soviet Union in
1940.
   Lithuanian historian Robertas Zhyugzhda, writing in Sovietskaya
Rossiya of the developments in Lithuania, said Germany and the
Soviet Union violated principles of international relations and
that Josef Stalin's final contacts with the independent government
of Lithuania amounted to an ultimatum.
   But he said the Soviet Union's actions and concerns were
understandable in the tense atmosphere building up to World War II.
The pact signed Aug. 23, 1939, is commonly known as the
Ribbentrop-Molotov pact after German Foreign Minister Joachim Von
Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov.
   Zhyugzhda revealed to Soviet readers that Estonia and Latvia
were assigned under the agreement to a Soviet sphere of influence
and that Lithuania originally was assigned to the German sphere.
   But in later negotiations after Germany attacked Poland on Sept.
1, Lithuania was assigned to the Soviet sphere, which Zhyugzhda
said was ``a gross violation of international principles and
norms.''
   Aside from recent publications in the Baltic republics, today
was the first time the Soviet press told its readers about the
spheres of influence.
   Soviet officials say the non-aggression treaty with Germany gave
their country a vital two years to prepare for an attack by
Hitler's forces, which finally came in June 1941.
   The historian said Lithuania's government tried to reorient
itself toward Germany after signing a mutual assistance treaty with
the Soviet Union and that Stalin responded by demanding a change in
the Lithuanian government.
   ``From the point of view of normal diplomatic relations, such
demands took the character of direct interference in the internal
affairs of a sovereign country,'' he said.
   Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania on Tuesday to demand greater autonomy on the anniversary
of the pact.
   Demonstrators waved the flags and sang the anthems of their
former nations and carried banners denouncing the secret agreement.
Authorities allowed the protests, and there were no reports of
violence or arrests.
   The demonstrations, unprecedented in size, were another
indication of foment in the area under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policies of greater openness.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said in a report on the
gathering in the Estonian capital Tallinn, that historian Yuri
Afanasyev urged Estonians to cool their passion for independence.
Afanasyev, one of the most outspoken critics of Stalin, said:
``There might be various assessments of the 1939 pact, but one
cannot ignore present-day realities.''
   ``The reality is that the Estonian economy is so much
interconnected with the all-union economy that mechanical
separation will inevitably lead the republic to economic
disaster,'' Tass quoted him as saying.
   In a report from the Latvian capital Riga, Tass said city
officials had agreed to hoist the historic blue-and-white city flag
of Riga along with that of the Soviet Union and Soviet Latvia on
special occasions. The decision by Riga officals probably was meant
as a small concession to nationalist feelings.

<TEXT>
   A millionaire businessman whose ailing
wife was kidnapped a month ago paid a total of nearly $1 million to
12 people listed in the ransom note as having been wronged by him,
the FBI said.
   Robert Hearin paid the ransom a day after receiving a second
note, in his wife's handwriting, indicating for the first time
since the abduction July 26 that Annie Laurie Herrin is alive, said
Wayne Taylor, FBI agent in charge in Mississippi.
   At least one of the 12 returned the money, an attorney said.
   Mrs. Hearin, 72, suffers from an intestinal disorder that could
be fatal without daily medication.
   Taylor, who released the second letter Tuesday, said he wanted
to assure the woman's abductors that her husband ``has done
everything conceivably possible to meet their demands, considering
the vagueness of them.''
   Hearin had conferred with the FBI before deciding to pay the $1
million, Taylor said.
   Investigators have no leads in their search for the woman,
Taylor said.
   FBI analysis confirmed Mrs. Hearin wrote the letter dated Aug.
10; it was postmarked Aug. 12 and received at the Hearins' Jackson
home on Aug. 15, Taylor said.
   Taylor wouldn't disclose the city from which the letter was
mailed or discuss its contents other than to say ``it urged him
(Hearin) to comply with the demands of the kidnappers.''
   A vague note left at the Hearins' home the day of the kidnapping
demanded Hearin right alleged wrongs to 12 people. The 12 had been
sued by Hearin's company, School Pictures of Mississippi, for money
they allegedly owed.
   At a news conference, Taylor disclosed that Hearin paid the 12
nearly $1 million, which equals the court judgments against them.
   An attorney for N. Alfred Winn of St. Petersburg, Fla., said
Tuesday that Winn returned his check and wrote a letter saying he
hoped Hearin's wife would be returned safely.
   ``Mr. Winn has no dispute with Mr. Hearin,'' said attorney Joe
Donahey of Clearwater, Fla., who didn't disclose the amount of the
check.
   Hiram Johnson Stutts Jr. told The Clarion-Ledger that he
received a check for $17,800 and ``a nice letter'' from Hearin.
Stutts refused to say what he had done with his check.
   ``Mr. Hearin didn't owe me that much money. I settled mine out
of court for half of the amount. I was happy with the settlement,''
he said.
   Vic Hanneld of Oklahoma City also told the newspaper that he had
received a check and letter from Hearin but said he didn't want to
discuss it.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Canada's largest Protestant
denomination, the United Church of Canada, decided today that
homosexuals can be considered for the ministry.
   The vote by the church's general council was 205 to 160 and
followed months of heated debate in which one-quarter of the
church's 4,000 ministers and 30,000 of its 860,000 members signed a
declaration opposing the ordination of homosexuals.
   The decision at the council's biannual meeting in Victoria,
British Columbia, came after midnight Tuesday and followed a
marathon debate. It was expected to lead to resignations and a
possible schism in the United Church, which was founded in 1925 as
a union of the Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian
denominations in Canada.
   More than 350 delegates finally adopted this resolution:
   ``That all persons regardless of their sexual orientation, who
profess faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to
be or become full members of the United Church. All members of the
church are eligible to be considered for ordered ministry.''
   While some argued that ``sexual orientation'' could mean those
with homosexual inclinations, conservative delegates interpreted
the phrase as welcoming candidates who actively practice
homosexuality.
   ``If we pass this, we do a far greater injustice to the people
who sit in the pews,'' said the Rev. Jim Somerville of Ottawa.
``They will vote with their feet and their dollars if we're not
sensitive to their needs.''
   Ordination candidate Bill Siksay of Ottawa, a member of a
national group for gays called Affirm, said: ``I'm very happy about
what we've done so far. But no one in Affirm is under any illusion
that tomorrow our task in the church will be any different.''
   Opponents of homosexual ordination vowed to continue their
fight, saying the recommendation changes the church's constitution
and requires a poll of all 4,205 congregations.
   However, the Rev. Eilert Frerichs, a member of Affirm, tried to
lessen fears by saying there will be no rush to the pulpit by gays
and lesbians.
   ``Given the present controversy in the church surrounding sexual
orientation, I don't think there are going to be very many of us
for the next 10 years at least who will stand up and say, `I'm
lesbian or gay. I'm seeking ordination or commissioning.' I think
God, in God's own time, will send us a final resolution.''
   Church procedures leave ordination up to regional conferences
and say it is inappropriate to ask candidates about sexual
orientation. Only the Hamilton, Ontario, conference has a stated
policy of not ordaining self-declared, practicing homosexuals.
   The vote followed a controversial report on sexuality last March
which said homosexuality should not be a barrier to ordination and
also suggested that sex outside of marriage was ``morally
responsible in a committed relationship.''
   The general council voted only to receive, not endorse, that
report.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer says he won't decide
whether to spare a condemned killer until the state Supreme Court
completes its review.
   Ronald Monroe, 33, had been scheduled to die in the electric

but was granted a stay of execution Tuesday by the Louisiana
Supreme Court.
   Roemer said he would wait before acting on a Pardon Board
recommendation that Monroe's death sentence be commuted to life
imprisonment without parole. However, Roemer said Tuesday that he
was leaning against commutation.
   Pardon Board chairman Yvonne Campbell said after a hearing
Monday that the panel found that Monroe had been deprived of his
rights. During the hearing, Monroe maintained his innocence.
   Prosecutors contend that Lenora Collins, 33, was killed after
she told Monroe he was being evicted from an apartment in the
family's duplex. The victim's daughter, then 11, also was stabbed
and identified Monroe as the assailant.
   Eighteen inmates, including three this year, have been executed
in Louisiana's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty in 1976.

   Divers working 15-hour days to raise a historic
ferry from the murky water off Ellis Island came close to their
goal before the deteriorated wreck sprang a leak and water rushed
back into the hull.
   The double-decker, which before its retirement carried 12
million immigrants to New York and New Jersey from Ellis Island,
had been pumped free of water and outfitted with pontoons Tuesday,
organizers said.
   ``We were going real well,'' said Naval Reserve Cmdr. Nick
Horney of Hudson, Ohio. ``Then a small portion of the deck
partially gave way. Over a period of years, it's just
deteriorated.''
   A series of Naval Reserve crews began working in April to
refloat the vessel, which began service in 1904 for what was then
the Bureau of Immigration, made its last run in 1954 and sank in
1968 while at dock.
   Bad weather forced another postponement today.
   ``We've been working very, very long hours for the past week and
a half,'' said Horney, commander of 17 Ohio divers who took on the
project as their annual, two-week tour of active duty. ``We need
something to occur to maintain the morale.''
   The 160-foot-long vessel could carry 1,000 immigrants in its
hold and was outfitted with a 12-bed sick bay and a padded cell for
violent mental patients.
   Named the Ellis Island after the site where immigrants to the
United States were once processed, the ferry is about 15 feet under
water at its lowest point. The starboard side juts out of the water
at low tide, mired in silt and mud.
   All that remains is its cast-iron hull.
   The National Park Service, which administers Ellis Island,
decided the wreck was a navigation hazard. The agency hasn't
decided what to do with the ferry but is dedicated to ``respecting
the ship's historical significance.''

<HEAD>20 Hurt During Stampede On Bread Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers struggling to make ends meet
under Yugoslavia's rising inflation stampeded while waiting on line
to buy bread, and a newspaper said today that 20 people were
injured.
   The incident occurred in the town of Titov Veles in Macedonia,
Yugoslavia's southernmost province, the Vecernje Novosti daily in
Belgrade said.
   It did not say when the stampede occurred.
   Quoting the local newspaper, Nova Macedonia, Vecernje Novosti
said bakeries are told to make at least 60 percent of their
production cheaper varieties of bread but that many stores do not
follow this advice.
   As a result, ``many people ... wake up early in the morning to
form lines in front of bakeries'' to obtain the less expensive
loaves, the paper said.
   Southern Yugoslavia is the poorest part of the country, and many
people have to manage on wages that are the equivalent of $50 to
$100 a month. That is one-third to two-thirds of the average
Yugoslav income.
   Their task is made more difficult by 170 percent inflation.
   The International Monetary Fund, which is trying to help
Yugoslavia lower the inflation rate to 95 percent this year, says
stringent economic controls, including a ban on wage increases, are
necessary to win the fund's approval for rescheduling payment of
Yugoslavia's $21 billion debt.

   An IRA bomb hidden in a van
exploded today and hurled a passing patrol car across a road,
injuring two policemen. The blast followed an explosion in Belfast
that injured a pregnant woman.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for
both attacks. The IRA also announced today it will step up its
attacks on commercial sites, in addition to British army targets.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said this morning's bomb in
Maghera, about 40 miles northwest of Belfast, was planted in a van
parked on the side of the road.
   The blast lifted an armored police car into the air and hurled
it across the road, slightly injuring the two officers inside, said
a spokesman, who by custom was not identified. He said the officers
were treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises.
   Police said ``a number of people have been arrested for
questioning about serious terrorist crime.'' Police would not
elaborate.
   On Saturday, a bomb hidden in a vehicle parked on the side of a
highway near Omagh, about 30 miles from Maghera, exploded as a
British military bus was passing by. Eight British soldiers were
killed and 27 wounded.
   On Tuesday night, a bomb in a stolen car exploded near the Royal
Navy recruiting office in Belfast, slightly injuring a pregnant
woman and causing widespread damage to buildings, police reported.
   Police said those responsible for the attack had stolen the car
after bursting in on a children's party in west Belfast.
   While some assailants held five adults and four children hostage
in the house for several hours before releasing them unharmed,
others loaded the bomb aboard the family car and drove it to the
city center.
   Police said they received telephone warnings before the Tuesday
night blast and cleared the area of most residents.
   The explosion was on a side street near the recruiting office,
where Lt. Alan Shields had worked before being killed in an IRA
bombing on Monday. He died when an IRA bomb attached to his car
exploded as he drove into east Belfast.
   He was the 26th British military man to die this year in IRA
attacks, compared with three last year.
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA has stepped up attacks recently in
its fight to end British rule in this Protestant-dominated province
and to unite it with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.
   British authorities say the IRA has acquired sophisticated new
explosives and detonators from Libya.
   ``It is our intention to begin using new devices in future car
bomb attacks against commercial and administrative property,
devices which will minimize the risk to the public,'' the IRA said
in a statement today.
   The statement unveiled a new car-bomb technique in which a smoke
grenade would go off before a blast, giving bystanders time to
flee. At the same time, a switch would be activated to immediately
set off the main charge if police attempted a controlled explosion
of the bomb.
   Tom King, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said he
attributed the IRA's stepped-up violence to ``the fact that they've
received increased armaments in terms of explosives and weapons
from (Libyan leader Col. Moammar) Gadhafi.''
   King, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
called the IRA ``a dedicated, vicious Marxist revolutionary group.''

<HEAD>Defense Chief Resigns After Sub Kills 30 Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of Japan's military resigned today to
take responsibility for the deaths of 30 civilians killed when a
naval submarine crashed into a sport fishing vessel.
   ``I presented Prime Minister (Noboru) Takeshita with a notice of
resignation today, just now,'' Tsutomu Kawara said at a news
conference. ``Many innocent lives were lost in an extremely
regrettable accident ... in which the defense force was one of the
parties involved.''
   Kawara was the first Defense Agency director-general in 17 years
to relinquish his post in a controversy linked to the armed forces.
   Only 18 of the 48 passengers on board survived when their
fishing boat, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, collided with the
submarine Nadashio in Tokyo Bay on July 23.
   Public outrage flared when televised reports, backed by
survivors' accounts, showed the submarine's crew standing by as
people drowned.
   Kawara, speaking slowly and fighting back tears, urged his
successor to work to restore public confidence in the military.
   ``There have been a large number of incidents involving the
Defense Agency and it is my hope that under the new
director-general ... this problem will be dealt with.''
   Kawara's 10-month term as agency head was marred by accidents
involving the military, which even in the best of times is
unpopular. So far this year, eight ships and three planes were
involved in 11 military accidents, and two pilots were killed.
   Takeshita appointed Kichiro Tazawa, 70, the new Defense Agency
chief.
   Tazawa said at a televised press conference that he was taking
his new responsibility ``under very difficult circumstances.'' He
praised his predecessor's moves to investigate the submarine
collision and said his main goal was implementing measures to
prevent accidents.
   Takeshita, attending a memorial service for the 30 victims
today, also said the government would take steps to prevent
maritime accidents and promised compensation for the victims'
families.
   Kawara, 51, reportedly turned down the resignations of two other
defense officials _ Seiiki Nishihiro, deputy Defense Agency head,
and Adm. Shuichiro Higashiyama, chief of staff of the Maritime
Self-Defense Forces.
   In Japan it is customary for high-ranking business executives or
government officials to assume responsibility for a major incident
and step down from their posts in an attempt to restore public
confidence in the institution they represent.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen today criticized his Republican opponent as inexperienced
and young, saying ``I don't think America can risk'' having Dan
Quayle a heartbeat away from the presidency.
   Bentsen, who has shied away from attacking his Senate colleague,
dropped his reticence before the Southern Legislative Conference, a
bipartisan lawmakers' group that Quayle will also address later
today.
   Bentsen said he was surprised when Quayle, the Indiana senator
and GOP vice presidential nominee, suddenly announced his support
for making the Veterans Administration a cabinet-level agency.
   Quayle was one of only 11 senators to oppose the bill, but
before the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday night he ``made a
deathbed conversion,'' Bentsen said.
   Quayle told the VFW his vote against the bill was a ``youthful
indiscretion.''
   ``A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only
five weeks ago,'' Bentsen said.
   ``I don't think America can risk youthful indiscretion in
someone who could become our president at any moment,'' the
67-year-old Texan said of his 41-year-old opponent.
   Bentsen has been touring the South in a campaign to sell running
mate Michael Dukakis to Southerners skeptical of the Massachusetts
governor, and more of that was expected in today's speech.
   The senator's staff said he would stick to the theme he used
before a pair of union audiences on Tuesday, when he hit Quayle and
Vice President George Bush on specific issues and steered clear of
personal attacks and the controversies surrounding Quayle. ``It's
not his style to pile it on,'' said one staff member.
   Instead, the senator planned to hammer away at Quayle's voting
record.
   Bentsen attacked Quayle on Tuesday for fighting against the new
law requiring 60' days notice for plant closings.
   Quayle ``fought it tooth and toenail,'' Bentsen told a clearly
friendly crowd of some 500 members of the United Auto Workers who
packed a meeting hall in Taylor, Mich.
   ``I know in some years past some Democrats went off and voted
for Ronald Reagan,'' Bentsen told them, eliciting boos of
disapproval and then cheers when he said, ``Well, I'm telling you,
come on home.''
   Bentsen also chided Quayle on Tuesday for suddenly deciding to
support the bill creating a Cabinet-level veterans' department.
Quayle announced his support for the legislation at his speech
before the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday night. Quayle
attributed his earlier opposition to ``youthful indiscretion.''
   ``That was just a month ago,'' when Quayle voted against it on
the Senate floor, Bentsen said.
   One of the goals of the week, which will include Bentsen's own
speech to the VFW on Thursday, is to show that ``Republicans don't
have proprietary rights over patriotism,'' said Joe O'Neill, one of
Bentsen's top aides.
   In addition to his open campaign schedule, Bentsen's days have a
liberal sprinkling of private fund-raisers, including a
$1,000-a-person event at a private home in the ritzy Bloomfield
Hills suburb of Detroit on Monday night.

<TEXT>
   Armed men attacked a base camp of nine
French, Canadian and Bolivian climbers high in the Andes near the
Peruvian border, and eight climbers were missing today, officials
said.
   ``The first information indicates that it is a group linked to
the Peruvian Shining Path guerrillas,'' said Jorge Alderete
Rosales, Bolivia's undersecretary of the interior.
   Bernardo Guarachi, a Bolivian guide who was with the climbers
and escaped to La Paz, said Tuesday that 16 men carried out the
attack Monday on the camp about 15,000 feet above sea level. He
said he heard shots fired but did not see any victims before
escaping down a glacier.
   The Shining Path, which splintered off from the Peruvian
Communist Party 10 years ago, seeks to overthrow the Peruvian
government and set up a Marxist state. The Peruvian government has
said that since the group turned from propaganda to violence in May
1980, it has killed more than 15,000 people and caused more than
$10 billion in damage.
   Guarachi, an experienced climber, said the guerrillas used
walkie-talkies and that five wore khaki uniforms. He said the men
made references to a Peruvian when they surrounded the camp, but he
did not elaborate.
   Bolivian air force planes and helicopters today flew over the
snow-covered mountains about 50 miles north of La Paz. Police said
the aircraft found the camp but no evidence of the mountaineers.
   Guerrillas previously had not been reported operating in the
Bolivian Andean region. The camp is surrounded by snow and mountain
peaks, and no people live nearby.
   An American who was at a lower base camp and unaware of the
attack returned to La Paz on Tuesday after the other climbers
failed to show up. His name was not immediately available.
   One of the Canadians was identified as Victor Ballom of Toronto.
Officials did not release the names of the five Frenchmen and two
Bolivians with the group.
   The travel agency Paititi, which handled the expedition, said
the Frenchmen and Canadians were experienced mountaineers. Guarachi
and the other Bolivians worked for Paititi.

<HEAD>Dutch Anti-Apartheid Activist Gets Five-Year Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch activist was sentenced to
five years in prison today for setting fire to two supermarkets and
a Shell service station to protest South Africa's apartheid policy.
   Rene Roemersma argued that he was acting in defense of South
Africa's 25 million blacks by setting fire to the facilities of
Dutch firms doing business in that country. But the court ruled
that no political motives were sufficient to justify such crimes.
   The attacks could ``easily have caused casualties,'' the court
said in sentencing the 30-year-old protester. They also caused
millions of dollars worth of damage.
   The fires at the two MAKRO supermarkets in Duiven and
Duivendrecht prompted the owner of the stores to sell its South
African factories. The firm that owned the markets, the SHV trading
company, complained publicly that the Dutch government could no
longer guarantee the safety of its stores.
   Although Roemersma never admitted to membership, a group called
Revolutionary Anti-Racist Action, or RARA, claimed responsibility
for each of the attacks for which he was convicted.
   They were among a spate of attacks by RARA, an acronym meaning
``Guess Who?'' in Dutch. All occurred in the pre-dawn hours when
few or no people were on the premises.
   RARA targeted a dozen Shell service stations across the nation
for arson and other vandalism to protest the Dutch-British oil
giant's operations in South Africa. The group claimed
responsibility for attacks on three MAKRO stores. Roemersma was
convicted in one of the gas station attacks.
   On April 11, police arrested eight RARA suspects after an
investigation by a special task force assigned to the attacks. They
released seven for lack of evidence within days. So only Roemersma
remained to stand trial.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in South Africa in which blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The space agency has invited proposals from
industry for a $1.2 billion project to design, develop and test the
next generation of booster rockets for the space shuttle.
   Firms have 60 days to submit their proposals.
   The first of the new rockets are to be placed into service in
1994, to be phased in over a three-year period. The contract award
is expected early next year.
   A total of $1 billion is for design and developing the boosters
and delivering six flight sets. An additional $200 million to $300
million is for construction of facilities on government-owned sites
at Yellow Creek, Miss., and NASA's Stennis Space Center near Bay
St. Louis, Miss.
   Five firms had study contracts for design and definition studies
for the rockets. One, Morton Thiokol, Inc., said it will not
compete for the contract. Thiokol, which makes all current shuttle
booster, will abandon that field when it delivers the last of the
redesigned rockets in the mid-1990s.
   The other firms are Aerojet Solid Propulsion Co., Sacramento,
Calif.; Atlantic Research Corp., Alexandria, Va.; Hercules
Aerospace Co., Salt Lake City, and United Technologies Chemical
Systems Divsion, San Jose, Calif.

   A Japanese businessman has bought
the single-engine Cessna airplane Mathias Rust flew into Red Square
last year, it was reported today.
   The West German, then 19, evaded sophisticated anti-aircraft
detection systems when he landed near the Kremlin on May 28, 1987,
causing a shake-up of the Soviet military command responsible for
security. The Soviets released Rust on Aug. 3 after 15 months in
prison.
   The airplane the Hamburg amateur pilot used for his flight has
been purchased by a Japanese businessman, the ZDF television
network reported. It did not give the buyer's name or the price
paid.
   The Cessna was kept in a hangar in suburban Hamburg and is to be
transported to Japan, Munich's AZ daily reported.
   After the plane was returned to Germany, Azuma Royal, a Munich
cosmetics firm, bought it for a reported $81,000 from the owner, a
private pilots club near Hamburg.
   The cosmetics company was hoping to use the famed Cessna for an
advertising campaign, but when the plan fell through, the plane was
offered for sale.A Munich trading company said it purchased the
aircraft for resale.
   ``We bought it for $44,000, and we are reselling it overseas,''
said Andrea Wenzel, a spokeswoman for the Baricom company. She did
not identify the buyer.

   More than 1 million newborns will be tested for
AIDS antibodies by the end of 1989 in a program federal researchers
hope will give them a true picture of the spread of the disease in
the United States.
   The infants will be tested randomly and anonymously in the
program, part of a $40 million package of initiatives to track the
spread of the virus.
   The tests will determine only whether the mother is infected,
Dr. Timothy Dondero said Tuesday, and a positive result does not
necessarily mean the child has or will get AIDS.
   Dondero, head of the sero-epidemiology branch of the AIDS
program at the Centers for Disease Control here, said some studies
indicate 30 percent to 50 percent of newborns testing positive for
the virus could eventually develop the disease.
   The program is intended to test a representative sample of the
population to determine where AIDS infection among women is
concentrated and to determine where to target prevention programs,
Dondero said.
   ``So far it is concentrated in big cities. It is important to
assess if it is prevalent in some rural areas as well,'' he said.
``Over time we will be able to monitor trends of infection in the
female half of the general population.''
   Dondero said plans for the tests are in place in 23 states plus
Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, and testing is already
under way in about half of those.
   Dondero said he expects about 30 states to participate by year's
end and more in 1989.
   Officials hope to test about 1.3 million infants, or one-third
of all babies born, by the end of 1989, and continue testing at the
same rate in succeeding years, Dondero said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, crippling its ability to ward off infection. The disease
has killed more than 30,000 Americans.
   AIDS is carried in blood and other bodily fluids. It is most
commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by shared, contaminated
drug needles. It is also spread, less often, from an infected
mother to her child before or at birth.
   The tests will conducted in addition to those routinely done on
newborns for treatable conditions.
   No names will be attached to the blood samples, and consent from
parents is not required, Dondero said. Otherwise, the random aspect
of the sample would be tainted.
   ``Most groups involved in testing _ military recruits, sexually
transmitted disease clinics, blood donors _ are to some extent
self-selected,'' he said. ``People do not agree to take part who
have some reason for not wanting to take part.''
   The CDC said the testing sites are expected to include Atlanta;
Baltimore; Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Dallas; Denver; Detroit;
Houston; Jacksonville, Fla.; Los Angeles; Miami; New Orleans; New
York; Newark, N.J.; Richmond, Va.; San Francisco; San Juan, Puerto
Rico; St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; Albuquerque, N.M.; Honolulu;
Kansas City; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; New Haven, Conn.;
Phoenix; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt Lake City; and Seattle.

   When China's army calls, its soldiers don't
always show up.
   The official Liberation Army Daily said today that when 50,000
reservists were told to assemble for an emergency exercise within
three days, 11,500 of them failed to arrive.
   The three-day mock battle in northwest China's Gansu province
last week was China's first province-wide mobilization maneuver of
reserve forces under simulated battle conditions, the paper said.
   The report did not say whether one-quarter of the reservists
called had been unable to find transport or simply ignored the
order.
   Two days after Vice Governor Mu Yongji issued the order, 300 of
the 1,342 reservists in Tianshui prefecture were still hundreds of
miles away in the neighboring provinces of Shaanxi, Qinghai,
Ningxia and Henan, the paper said.
   Provincial army leaders concluded from the poor showing that
``the reserve forces are highly dispersed... And a more effective
way should be instituted to hasten assembly.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists didn't find the hot springs
they were seeking on the floor of Crater Lake, but a park official
said the 17 dives in a one-person sub this month yielded valuable
scientific information.
   Oregon State University oceanographer Jack Dymond made the final
dive in the Deep Rover on Tuesday, said Peter Thompson, chief
ranger at Crater Lake National Park.
   The dives began Aug. 5 in the second year of a three-year study,
funded by the National Park Service, of the possible effect on the
lake of hot springs, or hydrothermal vents, that may be the
remnants of volcanic activity.
   The work is part of a larger 10-year study launched when the
1,932-foot-deep lake, the nation's deepest, began to lose some of
its famous clarity.
   The scientists said earlier this month that nothing they have
found so far could settle the question of whether proposed drilling
for hydrothermal energy more than seven miles away would affect the
lake.
   Although navigational difficulties precluded a precise search of
the area where the hydrothermal activity was suspected, Thompson
said a variety of hydrothermal information was gathered.
   In addition, he said, ``A great deal of biological and
geological information is going to be derived from the samples
taken.''
   Algae samples were taken as deep as 800 or 900 feet, he said,
including some with forms of life never described before. In
addition, a fish was sighted at 743 feet down.
   ``That's as deep as anyone has reported a fish in waters like
that,'' Thompson said.
   Crater Lake was formed when rain and melted snow filled the
crater created when the top of a volcano collapsed nearly 7,000
years ago.

   The United States and Soviet Union today opened a
conference to review the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and
both sides linked progress at separate arms talks to the other
side's compliance with the pact.
   The conference began today at the Soviet diplomatic mission,
U.S. spokesman Terry Shroeder said. He declined to give details.
   The first full meeting of both delegations, headed by Soviet
disarmament official Viktor Karpov and the head of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, Maj. Gen. William Burns, was
scheduled for Thursday.
   The conference is expected to last for one or two weeks. Under
the ABM treaty, such meetings must be held every five years to give
both sides a chance to list grievances.
   The ABM treaty allows each side to deploy only one ABM system
and limits the types of systems that may be deployed. The theory
for the agreement is that a potential aggressor would not launch a
nuclear attack if it faced the prospect of devastating retaliation.
   The United States has maintained a Soviet radar under
construction at Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, violates the treaty and
must be dismantled. The Soviets contend the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative, a research program aimed at creating a space-based
missile defense, violates the treaty and should be limited.
   According to an information sheet distributed by the U.S.
mission, U.S. officials recently told the Soviets that unless the
radar is dismantled, no agreement is possible at negotiations on
reducing strategic nuclear forces, or START.
   The START talks have been going on in Geneva since March 1985.
Both sides agree in principle that strategic forces should be
reduced by 50 percent.
   As a condition for the START agreement, the Soviets have for
years demanded that the United States limit its Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   The ABM treaty review opened in a low-key atmosphere following
earlier U.S. statements which hinted at a showdown over the
Krasnoyarsk radar.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said this month that
after hearing the Soviet position on Krasnoyarsk at the ABM
conference, ``should the situation remain unresolved, the president
will consult with the Congress and our allies concerning next
steps.''
   One possible next step, according to the U.S. information sheet,
would be for the United States to declare the radar a ``material
breach'' of the treaty. This would open the way for the United
States to terminate or suspend the treaty and then go beyond its
limits on the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   A U.S. delegation statement issued Tuesday did not speak of
possible retaliatory action.
   Karpov, in an arrival statement Saturday, said his side ``is
prepared to discuss'' the Krasnoyarsk radar. He said his delegation
is ``ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent adherence to
the ABM treaty.''
   Moscow will insist on ``the preservation of the ABM treaty
intact as it was signed in 1972,'' he said, apparently alluding to
Moscow's position that the Strategic Defense Initiative threatens
the treaty.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of tourists
packed their bags this morning and filed out of Yellowstone
National Park's Canyon area, forced from the cabin development by
flames from one of the park's 10 fires.
   Crews near Helena, Mont., aimed to contain a 37,000-acre blaze
by tonight; firefighters in Idaho tried to rein in a 750-acre fire
on the slopes of the nation's deepest gorge in Hells Canyon, and a
rash of wildfires broke out Tuesday in Oregon, including a small
blaze ignited by a plane crash that killed three.
   In Yellowstone, a finger of flame from a 91,700-acre fire in the
park's western section edged to within 2 miles of the Canyon area,
the largest development in the country's oldest national park.
   Park spokeswoman Robbie Blackwell said 306 tourists and as many
as 275 staff members spent Tuesday night in the development, which
also contains a visitors center, a general store and a campground.
   ``Nobody wanted to rattle beds and get people up. As the people
are getting up this morning they will start going through checkout
procedures, have breakfast this morning and then start leaving the
Canyon area,'' said the spokesman.
   The fire, one of 10 in the park involving some 350,000 acres,
was the only one to post major advances Tuesday despite winds
gusting to about 30 mph. Low temperatures aided some 4,000
firefighters and 1,200 soldiers battling flames.
   Several other areas in the park are closed, including its Grant
Village complex containing a campground, hotel, visitors center and
staff dormitories.
   Many of the guests who had reserved spaces at Canyon's 600
cabins were moved to other park lodgings Tuesday night, said Steve
Tedder of TW Services, Yellowstone's concessionaire.
   ``Everything has been very orderly,'' he said. ``This has almost
become business as usual, as we've lived with it (the fires) for
about seven weeks.''
   Reservations are off about 25 percent this summer, Tedder added,
almost certainly because of this year's fires, the worst in memory
in Yellowstone.
   In Idaho, 400 firefighters battled to keep a fire from moving
over a ridge and into area with 12 million board-feet of timber the
National Forest Service wants to sell.
   Firefighters at a 156,500-acre blaze in Yellowstone's
northeastern corner were aided Tuesday by about 600 soldiers from
Fort Lewis, Wash. Another 600 Fort Lewis soldiers were to help
clean up a 4,300-acre fire in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National
Forest and adjacent Grand Teton National Park.
   In Montana, winds Tuesday pushed a blaze away from the towns of
Cooke City and Silver Gate, officials said.
   In mountains southeast of Helena, nearly 3,000 firefighters
gained a foothold in a two-week battle to contain the 37,600-acre
fire that destroyed more than a dozen structures.
   ``There are no problems on the line that we've heard of, and
we're still hoping for containment by 8 p.m.,'' said Gordon Gray, a
fire information officer.
   In the west-central Oregon town of LaPine, three families were
briefly evacuated Tuesday night because of one of a series of small
fires in the state. Lightning was blamed for at least 50 of the
blazes.
   Near Morton, Wash., gusty wind and 100-degree temperatures
allowed a forest fire to grow from 60 acres to 500 within a few
hours Tuesday, officials said. The blaze burned mostly on land
owned by the Murray Pacific Co., a timber firm.

   Austin (Texas) American-Statesman on a national energy policy:
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the No. 2 man on the Democratic ticket, is
perfectly right to decry the Reagan administration's lack of
interest in expanding the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   But it is also worth noting that an expanded reserve ... should
be only one part of an overall national energy policy, and neither
the Reagan administration nor the Congress has yet come close to
developing such a policy. ...
   Everything is partisan during an election campaign. ...
   But after the issue of the presidency is settled, it is to be
hoped that the new administration and the Congress will find time
to agree on a bipartisan national energy policy that will include
conservation, alternative and synthetic fuels, and incentives for
domestic oil and gas exploration _ a policy that will enable the
nation to become as energy self-sufficient as possible.

   Sunday Sun-Journal, Lewiston, Maine, on the influence of
lobbyists:
   Influence peddlers on Capitol Hill spent more than $63 million
trying to persuade Congress in 1987.
   The total represents a 4.5 percent increase from 1986, when the
income tax changes caused a surge of lobbying efforts. ...
   The list of groups continues with a seemingly endless number of
causes.
   Lawmakers should be wary of the information supplied by special
interest groups.
   The inherent bias built into these organizations should raise a
red flag of suspicion and any statistics given could be
questionable.
   Hopefully, Congress evaluates each issue in isolation _ apart
from the arm-twisting that lobbyists exert.
   With any luck, lawmakers will not adopt barnyard appetites for
this type of slop.

   Saginaw (Mich.) News on Dan Quayle and his National Guard
service:
   The issue of Dan Quayle's Vietnam-era National Guard service
ought to be put into perspective.
   In joining the National Guard, Quayle, the Republican nominee
for vice president, did precisely what all but the most rare of men
did in that day.
   He looked for the best deal. And so did just about everyone
else, including those who went to Vietnam. ...
   This is not to suggest any absence of dedication among those who
served. The evidence of Vietnam was just the opposite. ...
   How many of those who did heroically slog through the swamps and
jungles and froze in the mountains can say today that given a
choice and a chance, they would not rather have missed out on all
that fun and excitement? ...
   The question is whether Quayle did serve when his time came. He
did. So let's drop the hypocrisy, and the harping.

   The Leaf-Chronicle, Clarksville, Tenn., on the penal system:
   Geraldine Ferraro says she can't understand what the fuss is all
about.
   Her son, John Zaccaro Jr., ... was sentenced to up to five years
in prison, with all but four months suspended, for selling cocaine
when he was a college student.
   As with many states, Vermont has an overcrowded prison system.
To get non-violent offenders out of the state institutions, a
program allows them to secure their own housing while under the
supervision of a corrections officer, who periodically checks on
them.
   Zaccaro was able to afford much better housing than his fellow
convicts. He's doing his time in a $1,500-a-month luxury apartment.
...
   The concept behind the house arrest program is sound. But it
shouldn't include drug felons or make a joke out of the penal
system by permitting those with money to buy a lockup that most
law-abiding citizens can only dream of living in.

   The Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash., on Congressional
honoraria:
   Our $89,500 per year members of Congress are being urged by no
less a figure than Speaker of the House Jim Wright to give up what
has become a disgrace: the honoraria that incumbents receive for
giving speeches.
   These appearances, for which the members may receive up to
$2,000 apiece, are essentially the gravy boats to go with their
pork-chopping ways.
   The money comes from special interest groups. In a word,
lobbyists. They think nothing of awarding the members of Congress
for any considerations that might be thrown their way.
   This is legal, but it is not right.
   Our Congress was envisioned as a noble body acting as a balance
against excesses in the executive branch, and the fashioner of our
laws.
   Instead, with this disgusting largesse, we are made witness to a
feeding spectacle of embarrassing proportions. ...
   Perhaps Wright's endorsement, coming as it does from one more
soiled than most in these sordid little deals, will succeed where
virtue and ethical behavior have not.

   East Oregonian, Pendleton, Ore., on George Bush's selection of
Dan Quayle:
   George Bush's choice of Sen. Dan Quayle to be his running mate
is uninspiring, ... but voters will make their decision basically
on the performances of the presidential _ rather than the vice
presidential _ candidates. ...
   Bush's selection of Quayle on the Republican ticket probably
tells voters something about Bush's political philosophy.
   Quayle's voting record in Congress is firmly on the conservative
right wing of the political spectrum.
   Bush will easily attract the votes of conservatives away from
(Democratic presidential nominee Michael) Dukakis this November
without a conservative running mate.
   So his selection of Quayle apparently says Bush feels
comfortable with someone from the right wing or wants to cater
strongly to right-wing voters.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on George Bush's selection of Dan
Quayle:
   Apart from whether family influence was used to get him into the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War era, (Dan) Quayle
presents basic problems for the ticket.
   Quayle's presence reflects questionable judgment on the part of
Vice President Bush, a presidential nominee who had five months to
think about a running mate and who rushed to select someone he did
not know as well as he should have.
   To repair the situation, Quayle needs to answer the National
Guard question and others about his pre-political life, and to
begin campaigning in more serious settings.
   He should get away from rally scenes that require him to shout
political rhetoric and try other, smaller arenas where he can be
seen and heard in ways that may inspire more confidence in his
government skills.

   The (Baltimore) Sun on the Vincennes report:
   The main effect of the Pentagon's investigation of the USS
Vincennes' downing of an Iranian civil airliner on July 3 is to
exonerate the equipment.
   Confidence is maintained in the complex Aegis radar tracking
system, and in the Ticonderoga class of guided missile cruisers.
... ``The equipment functioned as designed,'' said Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe,
upheld the action taken by Capt. Will C. Rogers III on the basis of
information available.
   The secretary rejected the recommendation of the panel headed by
Rear Adm. William Fogarty that an officer be censured. ...
``Mistakes are made in virtually every combat situation,'' Carlucci
said.
   An official who sends military personnel into combat must expect
that. So must an official who sends airliners over the area.
   The Reagan administration trusted in the perfection of American
boys when it sent them into treacherous waters. The Khomeini regime
in Tehran made the same mistake in thinking it could attack them
without risk to innocents nearby.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on Nelson Mandela:
   It's been nearly 10 months now since the South African
government freed Govan Mbeki, the 77-year-old former chairman of
the outlawed African National Congress.
   Observers hoped that Mbeki's freedom signaled the imminent
release of Nelson Mandela, the charismatic ANC leader who, like
Mbeki and six other ANC members, was imprisoned in 1964 after being
convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government.
   But Mandela, 70 years old, is still in prison. And now his
lawyer and family report that he suffers from tuberculosis. That is
all the more reason for him to be freed.
   The time is ripe for countries such as the United States to step
up calls for Mandela's release.
   South Africa may be stubborn, but it is not totally deaf to
international sentiment _ or to its own best interests. Last year's
release of Mbeki proved that.

   North Jersey Advance, Flanders, N.J., on limiting House and
Senate terms:
   Although Republican platform drafts are scripted in advance, an
unexpected plank swept the delegates.
   It called for a limit on the number of terms that House and
Senate members can serve.
   This harkened back to the 22nd Amendment, which limits a
president to two four-year terms.
   With Congress becoming a lifetime job, with members holding huge
advantages over challengers and with their increasing arrogance and
unaccountability, a limit in their ``service'' may be the best idea
on either platform.

   Las Vegas (Nev.) Review-Journal on the homeless:
   Jesse Jackson's out on the campaign trail trying to beat the
Reagan administration over the head with the homeless issue, which
Jackson blames on the heartless ``economic violence'' of the
aforementioned administration.
   Jackson contends in his speeches there are ``5 to 10 million
homeless'' people roaming the streets of the United States. Where
he gets that figure is a mystery. Someone ought to ask him.
   Michael Dukakis talks about the ``3 to 5 million homeless'' in
the United States. Is Dukakis using different sources for his
information than Jackson? We doubt it. They are both guessing,
that's all.
   A Harvard University demographic analysis estimated the national
homeless population at 279,000. ... The Census Bureau estimates no
more than 400,000 nationwide.
   All this is to say that before we go making massive
tax-supported ``investments'' in big-scale, low-income housing
projects, as Jackson would have us do, let's first find out how
serious the problem of homelessness is.
   Maybe with reliable figures _ not wild guesses _ we can
formulate a rational policy.

   Des Moines (Iowa) Register on Dan Quayle and his National Guard
service:
   If he remains on the GOP ticket, Dan Quayle will be a
distraction from the issues throughout the campaign for the
presidency. George Bush should replace him as his running mate. ...
   In trying to reach out to the baby-boom generation, Bush failed
to discern how his choice of a running mate would dredge up one of
that generation's most terrible memories.
   It is the memory of how the Vietnam War was fought by the poor,
the black, the blue collar, while young men from better-off
families generally managed to avoid combat duty.
   J. Danforth Quayle III, although he came of age at the height of
the war, stayed home in the Indiana National Guard.
   There's nothing wrong with National Guard service, but in
Quayle's case it has the appearance of hypocrisy because his
political record is that of a military hawk.
   And it reeks of special privilege because his wealthy family had
connections that eased his way into the guard. ...
   The best thing Bush could do would be to ask his running mate to
withdraw.

restated the themes of the Reagan administration, but also went
beyond them.
   In addition to the expected conservative issues _ such as
opposition to gun control and abortion and support for capital
punishment _ he gave special emphasis to protecting the environment
and to the problems of low-income families. ...
   Bush clearly feels that he is now out of the shadow of President
Reagan and is free to chart his own course and to give free rein to
his own personality. ...
   Bush's performance Thursday night showed that he is better
suited for the contest than his critics had believed.

   The Miami Herald on the need for prenatal care for the poor:
   Chalk up one more tragedy caused by crack cocaine, one more
tragedy complicated by the nation's _ and Florida's _ failure to
provide adequate prenatal care to its poor.
   The tragedy is the horrific increase in babies born in Florida
with syphilis.
   Last year, 110 babies were born with the disease. In the first
half of this year, that total soared to 120 (91 of those in South
Florida). ...
   The price of undelivered prenatal care is high, and higher still
for babies of the poor.
   While clinic care costs about $600, intensive care for babies
born too early or too small can range to $100,000. For babies born
damaged, that bill is just a down payment on a lifetime of special
needs.
   That, and the loss of a potentially productive citizen is the
bill society pays for its neglect.
   Parents pay for their neglect with their guilt and tears. But it
is the babies who pay the dearest price: their health and even
their lives.

<TEXT>
   ST-BASILE-LE-GRAND, Quebec (AP) _ Police today kept about 3,000
residents from returning to their homes after thousands of gallons
of oil laced with PCBs caught fire and released a poisonous black
cloud.
   The warehouse fire broke out at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and was
extinguished after burning for more than six hours.
   Quebec provincial police sealed off a 1-by-5-mile corridor in
this suburb across the St. Lawrence River and 15 miles east of
Montreal. Officials warned people in a wide area including eastern
Montreal not to eat vegetables from their gardens.
   ``So long as we are not 100 per cent certain that the soil, air
and water are 100 per cent safe, we are not going to let people go
back into their homes,'' said Clifford Lincoln, Quebec's
environment minister. Technicians today examined the soil and water
around Montreal.
   Environment Ministry technician Alain Lavoie said at least 50
residents were treated in hospitals for skin and lung irritation,
but no serious injuries were reported.
   PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, are fire-retardant chemicals
that were used most often as insulating fluids or coolants in
heavy-duty electrical equipment suchthe community using loudspeakers to
order the
evacuation. Residents spent the night in local schools.
   ``Until the results of our tests, we are telling people not to
eat food from their gardens or drink tap water because 30 percent
of their water comes from a lake in the contaminated area,'' Lavoie
said.
   Montreal fire director Raymond Therrien also advised residents
of eastern Montreal not to eat fruit and vegetables from their
gardens until further notice.
   ``Because of the winds, the cloud of smoke from this fire spread
over east-end neighborhoods during the night,'' Therrien said.
   Jean-Guy Campbell, who lives near the warehouse, said he was
outside with his wife when the fire started with an explosion.
   ``There was a black cloud about three stories high,'' Campbell
said. ``I could feel it on my skin. It was very itchy.''
   Other evacuees complained of sore throats, itchy skin and
dizziness after inhaling the smoke.
   ``In two or three years, how many cancers will we have?'' said
resident Lise Sweeney.
   Eugene Jankowski, a St-Basile town councilor, said the
warehouse, owned by Marc Levy, stored 500 barrels containing about
23,000 gallons of oil laced with PCBs. Levy could not be reached
for comment.
   Gerard Latulippe, who represents the area in the Quebec
legislature and was among the evacuees, said the government had had
trouble getting the warehouse to conform to environmental standards.
   ``The company had to be forced to take some measures to improve
the safety of the site and some things were done,'' he said.
   Lincoln said the government had threatened to suspend Levy's
permit unless the company adhered to its specifications and that
Levy complied with most of the conditions.
   The only plant in Canada capable of destroying PCBs is in Swan
Hills, Alberta, but it does not accept PCB waste from other
provinces.

   Undefeated heavyweight champion Mike Tyson,
wearing a cast on his right hand, says he tried to duck a street
fight with one of his former ring victims but ``had no choice''
when the man ripped his shirt.
   Tyson, who suffered a hairline fracture in his right hand during
the scuffle early Tuesday, said Mitchell Green started a fight as
the champion was getting into his car outside a 24-hour clothing
store in Harlem.
   Green ripped his shirt and ``hit me on the chest. He was upset.
I guess I hit him over the eye. I was nervous. I hadn't had a
street fight in seven years. I was scared,'' Tyson said.
   Tyson said Green was ``ranting and raving'' that Tyson and
promoter Don King owed him money.
   ``We fought one time. He had a bad deal on his purse and he
didn't make a great deal of money,'' Tyson said.
   Green, a former contender for the U.S. Boxing Association title
who lost a decision to Tyson in 1986, said Tyson ``popped him on
the bridge of his nose,'' requiring five stitches, according to
police spokesman Sgt. John Clifford.
   Green, 31, of New York, said Tyson punched him first after he
told Tyson he did not think the champ had beaten him in the ring.
   A summons charging Tyson with misdemeanor assault was issued.
But the boxer did not appear at the stationhouse today as expected.
His publicist, Howard J. Rubenstein, said it was because his hand
was hurting and he had to see a doctor.
   Rubenstein said the police agreed to postpone Tyson's appearance
until Thursday.
   Tyson's manager, Bill Cayton, said he did not know whether
Tyson's Oct. 8 fight against Frank Bruno in England would have to
be rescheduled because of the injury.

<HEAD>Minnesota North Stars Player Sent To Jail For a Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National Hockey League star Dino Ciccarelli of
the Minnesota North Stars was convicted today of assaulting a
player with his stick in a game last season and sentenced to a day
in jail and a $1,000 ($820 U.S.) fine.
   Ciccarelli, 28, was led from Ontario Provincial Court in
handcuffs after Judge Sidney Harris handed down his sentence.
   ``It is time now a message go out from the courts that violence
in a hockey game or in any other circumstances is not acceptable in
our society,'' Harris said.
   The NHL right-winger had pleaded innocent to the assault charge.
   At his trial last month, Ciccarelli testified he had
``definitely no intention'' of injuring Toronto Maple Leaf
defenseman Luke Richardson during a game at Maple Leaf Gardens last
Jan. 6.
   Richardson was not injured, but Ciccarelli was ejected from the
game and later given a 10-game suspension.
   Ciccarelli testified that he struck Richardson on the side of
his helmet after the defenseman cross-checked him.
   A native of Sarnia, Ontario, and eight-year NHL veteran,
Ciccarelli said he had been the victim of several attacks by
opposing players, often when the referee wasn't looking.
   ``In recent games, I'd taken a lot ... out there and nothing was
called. I was upset.'' he testified.
   It was Cicarrelli's second criminal conviction this year. He
pleaded guilty last January to a charge of indecent exposure in
Minnesota.
   Several NHL players have been charged, but few ever convicted,
for on-ice attacks against opponents. Jimmy Mann of the Winnipeg
Jets was fined $500 for leaving the bench and hitting Paul Gardner
of the Pittsburgh Penguins in the face and breaking his jaw in 1982.

<HEAD>Quayle Embarks On Solo Campaign Trip As New Revelations Surface</HEAD>

12-17 on Quayle's airport encounter with Bentsen.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle began his first solo campaign trip today by ignoring the
controversy over his Vietnam-era military service and instead
urging creation of ``real jobs'' for millions of needy Americans.
   The Indiana senator also told an audience of Midwestern state
legislators that ``Congress could stand a little bit of
perestroika'' _ a reference to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of economic restructuring _ in the way it drafts the federal
budget.
   Quayle made only an oblique reference to the persistent
controversy over his 1969 entry into the Indiana National Guard and
reports of a Florida golfing weekend he spent in 1980 with a female
former lobbyist.
   ``Those of you thinking of running for vice president,'' he
said, ``I want you to know that taking out your trash is a photo
opportunity.''
   It was while Quayle was taking out his trash at his McLean, Va.,
home in the Washington suburbs Tuesday that waiting reporters and
cameramen pounced on him for comment about the controversy swirling
around him.
   Quayle denounced the allegations as rumor, gossip and ``outright
lies'' which were preventing him from showing the public how he
intends to work with nominee George Bush to promote GOP goals of
``jobs, peace, freedom.''
   In his Cincinnati speech, at the outset of his first foray alone
on the campaign trail, Quayle sought to do just that.
   He stressed his support for a job training bill he co-sponsored
in the early 1980s, which he said had created millions of jobs for
women, minorities and disadvantaged workers.
   ``These aren't make-work, makeshift type of jobs,'' he said.
``They are real jobs.''
   Quayle also proposed that the federal budget be written every
two years rather than going through the current laborious process
every year in a crisis atmosphere.
   He said the budget process should be simplified, and the
president should be given line-item veto authority to reject
objectionable portions of legislation rather than requiring veto of
an entire bill.
   From Cincinnati, Quayle flew to Lexington, Ky., where he had an
airport encounter with his Democratic counterpart, vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. Bentsen had just
addressed the same group of Southern state legislators that was
waiting to hear from Quayle.
   ``I've warmed up the crowd for you,'' Bentsen said.
   ``I hope you said good things about me,'' Quayle said.
   ``I don't want to wish you that much good luck,'' Bentsen
replied.
   The two men laughed and shook hands.
   Quayle was to speak to a national conference of enlisted
National Guardsmen in St. Louis tonight.
   At home Tuesday, Quayle said he believed the Guard issue will
fade during the campaign because Americans would rather hear about
peace, jobs and freedom.
   As for new reports about his entry into the Guard and
relationship with former lobbyist Paula Parkinson, Quayle said:
``This is just getting a little bit outrageous and I'm getting a
little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another.''
   Quayle has denied using his family's influence to get into the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War, saying that the
Guard had openings at the time.
   But a retired Indiana guard official acknowledged Tuesday that
he asked the Guard personnel office to ``hold'' a space for Quayle
after receiving a call from a Quayle family friend in 1969.
   Retired Major Gen. Alfred Ahner, former military support officer
for Indiana and later head of the state's National Guard, said he
was contacted by an old friend, Wendell Phillippi, a retired Guard
commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by Quayle's family.
   ``Wendell Phillippi had called and said he had a good man, and
said he thought he'd make a good Guardsman,'' Ahner said in a
telephone interview from Indiana.
   After learning there were a couple vacancies, ``I said hold one
of them, there's a good guy coming over,'' he said.
   ``We couldn't take him if there wasn't any opening,'' Ahner
said. He said Quayle was accepted into the state's headquarters
unit, which was ``pretty selective'' and looked for recruits with
intelligence and leadership potential.
   He said he ``paid attention'' to Phillippi because ``he was a
former commanding general'' who would have an eye for who might
make a good Guardsman. Ahner said Quayle received no preferential
treatment during his service.
   Meanwhile, Playboy magazine said Tuesday an article in its
November edition includes a statement from Ms. Parkinson that
Quayle propositioned her during a trip to Florida eight years ago
but that she rebuffed him because she was with another man.
   ``We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and
suggestively,'' Ms. Parkinson said in the Playboy interview. ``He
said he wanted to make love.''
   The release by Playboy followed a report in the Daily News of
Los Angeles in which two former attorneys for Ms. Parkinson say she
told the FBI in 1981 about the alleged proposition.
   One of the attorneys, Washington lawyer Glenn Lewis, told The
Associated Press that Playboy's account was consistent with what
Ms. Parkinson had told the FBI.
   ``Quayle made a pass at her, said he would like to sleep with
her. She said, `No, I'm with Tom.''' Lewis said, referring to
former U.S. Rep. Tom Evans, R-Del., who went on the golfing trip to
Florida in 1980.
   Ms. Parkinson, Evans, Quayle, then a representative, and a third
congressman shared a cottage, and the FBI looked into the outing in
an investigation into whether sexual favors were traded for votes
against legislation. Officials dropped the case seven years ago
without filing charges.
   ``I had nothing to do with her down there ...,'' Quayle said
Tuesday. ``I've got a wife and three small children, and I hope
there's some respect and dignity for things I did not do before we
go rushing off with all these so-called rumors.''
   Quayle, who has been married since 1972, has said he did not
have an affair with Ms. Parkinson.

<HEAD>Grain Production Will Not Reach Quota, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's grain production is expected to fall
short of this year's government-set quota because of natural
disasters and rising production costs, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   The China Daily, quoting officials from the National Research
Center for Development of Science and Technology, said 28 million
acres of farmland, about 10 percent of China's total, have been hit
by a severe drought. It said another 17.3 million acres have been
inundated by floods.
   The report also said farmers were discouraged from planting
grains by low government-set prices and high production costs.
   Agriculture experts predict the 1988 grain output will fall
slightly short of this year's annual quota of 410 million tons.
   After a record 407 million tons were grown in 1984, grain output
fell to 379 million tons in 1985, then edged back up to 402 million
tons last year.

   Ten Soviets arrived Wednesday to carry out the last
inspection of a U.S. missile base before the end of a two-month
inspection period under the superpower treaty to eliminate
medium-and shorter-range nuclear weapons.
   The inspectors will stay at a hotel until they give official
notice _ within a 48-hour period _ that they intend to visit the
base in Comiso, in southeastern Sicily. According to U.S. and
Italian officials, 112 Tomahawk cruise missiles are deployed in
Comiso.
   A U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Soviets were expected to fly to the base in an American
military aircraft to Comiso on Friday.
   Under the terms of the treaty, the Soviets can take as long as
24 hours to inspect missiles, missile launchers and related
equipment. They can request an eight-hour extension, which U.S.
officials can grant or refuse.
   The Soviets will be escorted by 10 Americans, including military
officials, and by four Italian military officers and a
representative of the Foreign Ministry.
   At the end of the inspection, inspectors and escorts must
exchange reports.
   During the 60-day inspection period, which ends at midnight Aug.
29, the Soviets had 30 sites to visit in the United States and in
five Western European countries. U.S. inspectors had 133 sites to
cover in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the East bloc.
   Three of the Soviet inspectors had visited sites in the United
States and a fourth had inspected U.S. and Western European
facilities. Previous Soviet inspections have taken place in West
Germany, Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands.
   The treaty calls for the elimination within three years of all
U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400
miles.
   The head of the Soviet inspection team, Gennadiy Mikhailovich
Komogortsev, said in his arrival speech that the aim of the visit
is to verify that the number of missiles, launchers and other
related equipment corresponds to details provided by the Americans.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who
died in a plane crash that government officials suspect was caused
by sabotage, had many enemies at home and abroad who wanted him out
of power.
   Pakistani and U.S. investigators searching the wreckage in
eastern Pakistan of the president's C-130 transport plane have yet
to report their findings on the crash Aug. 17 that killed the
five-star army general, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others.
   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan has said the crash was a
``dastardly crime,'' but neither he nor any other official has
indicated who is to blame.
   Zia made many enemies in his 11 years as the iron-fisted leader
of this nation of 107 million people in strategic central Asia. He
also was surrounded by unfriendly governments in India, Afghanistan
and the Soviet Union.
   Zia enraged the Moscow-backed, communist government of
Afghanistan by providing strong support to Moslem insurgents
fighting to overthrow Kabul. Pakistan was the conduit for the
shipment of American and Saudi weapons to Afghan rebels who have
been fighting a guerrilla war for nearly a decade.
   Najib, Afghan's president, sent a condolence message to Ishaq
Khan that referred to the crash only as an incident and did not
mention Zia by name.
   A Western diplomatic source in Islamabad reported Tuesday that
Khad, the Afghan intelligence agency, and ``other (Kabul) regime
supporters spent the night of Aug. 17 celebrating President Zia's
death.''
   Zia's support of the Afghan rebels also angered the Soviet
Union, which has maintained troops in Afghanistan since 1979 in
support of Najib's government. Moscow, which is withdrawing its
troops, repeatedly has said Pakistan is providing assistance to the
insurgents in defiance of a U.N.-sponsored agreement reached this
year to bring peace to Afghanistan.
   Pakistan and its neighbor to the east, India, always have had
tense relations and have fought three wars in 41 years. New Delhi
was particularly concerned about reports, which Pakistan denied,
that Zia's government was developing an atomic bomb.
   But one Western diplomatic source, who demanded anonymity, noted
that India on several occasions ``has indicated it could
communicate with Zia.'' The source said New Delhi equated the
Pakistani leader with stability.
   Zia's enemies at home included political opposition leaders,
religious minorities and groups seeking autonomy.
   Benazir Bhutto, the main opposition leader who heads the
Pakistan People's Party, has a personal grudge against Zia: He
executed her father in 1979.
   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was a populist prime minister
ousted in a 1977 military coup led by Zia. Bhutto was hanged two
years later for alleged with conspiracy to murder a political
opponent.
   Ms. Bhutto's party has been strongly critical of Zia,
particularly his decision to forbid candidates from running as
members of political parties in nationwide elections scheduled for
November.
   Another significant political opponent of Zia was Abdul Wali
Khan, leader of the pro-Kabul Awami National Party.
   Some members of the Moslem Shiite sect, which makes up 5 percent
of the nation's population, disliked Zia for his religious and
foreign policies.
   Zia, a member of the majority Sunni sect, was the driving force
behind instituting Moslem law in Pakistan. But hard-line Shiites
claimed the program did not take into account their form of
jurisprudence.
   Pakistan's Shiites also disapproved of Zia's close ties to the
United States, which has had icy relations with Shiite-led Iran.
   An English-language newspaper, the Muslim of Islamabad, reported
Monday that members of the minority sect blamed Zia for the death
of a Pakistani Shiite leader who was assassinated Aug. 5 while
leaving a mosque in the northwest frontier city of Peshawar. Arif
Hussain al-Hussaini headed an opposition political party, the
Movement for Enforcement of Shia Jurisprudence.
   More than 100 Shiites were arrested ``when they fired in the air
to rejoice the deaths of (Zia and Raphel) because they felt the
Pakistan government and the Americans had a hand in the murder'' of
al-Hussaini, the newspaper said.
   Sectarian strife broke out in the northwest frontier, the paper
said, when Shiites and Sunnis ``disputed whether to celebrate or
mourn'' Zia's death.
   Shiite groups denied that such celebrations took place.
   Also dissatisfied with Zia were groups in the southern province
of Sind who are seeking autonomy. The late president was from
northern Punjab province.
   Some Sindhis have sought more economic autonomy to build up
their province, which includes some extremely undeveloped regions.
They claim the province is not fairly treated because Punjabis
dominate the federal government.

   The bounties began last year and are being re-emphasized as

   Democratic vice president candidate Lloyd Bentsen today
criticized Republican Dan Quayle over a recent vote and questioned
the Indiana senator's readiness for high office, saying Americans
can't risk ``youthful indiscretion'' in someone so close to the
presidency.
   The 41-year-old Quayle touted his own role in drafting jobs
legislation as he sought to overcome the controversy that has
plagued him in the week since he became George Bush's running mate.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis picked up the
formal endorsement of the AFL-CIO and union president Lane Kirkland
took the opportunity criticize the Reagan administration for
favoring ``greed over need.'' Bush was on the West Coast with a
joint campaign appearance on his schedule with a vacationing
President Reagan.
   Bentsen's comment about Quayle was his harshest to date, and it
came in a speech to Southern legislators meeting in Lexington, Ky.
   He said that Quayle was one of 11 senators to vote earlier this
year against legislation making the Veterans Administration a
Cabinet-level agency. Then, Bentsen said, Quayle told the Veterans
of Foreign Wars on Monday his vote was a ``youthful
indiscretion''and he had changed his mind.
   Said the 67-year-old Texas senator: ``A youthful indiscretion?
My friends, that vote occurred only five weeks ago.
   ``I don't think America can risk youthful indiscretion in
someone who could become our president at any moment.''
   Bentsen, a World War II bomber pilot, also indirectly zinged
Quayle on his National Guard service, saying ``some of the things
that happened to me early on in combat make you grow up pretty
fast.''
   Quayle was campaigning in Cincinnati on the first stop of his
first solo campaign tour since joining the GOP ticket, and he made
only a wry comment about the furor surrounding his National Guard
service during the Vietnam war. ``Those of you thinking for running
for vice president, I want you to know that taking our your trash
is a photo opportunity,'' he said in a reference to the reporters
who greeted him with questions Tuesday morning as he dragged his
trash barrels to the street.
   The Indiana senator said the Job Training and Partnership Act,
which he helped draft in the early 1980s, had provided jobs for
millions of workers, including women, minorities and the poor.
   ``This program is working. We have trained 3.4 million
economically disadvantaged people in Amnerica so far, and there
will be millions more,'' he said.
   Quayle's appearance in Cincinnati marked the latest in a string
of attempts by the Republicans to shed the controversy that has
plagued the GOP ticket.
   Bush told reporters on Tuesday his campaign for the White House
would get back on track ``whenever you stop asking me these
questions.''
   But Bush also told a crowd of supporters gathered in front of
the California State Capitol in Sacramento: ``I'm not going to let
some insidious rumormongers drive me to change my mind. I'm
standing behind Dan Quayle.''
   Quayle is facing questions about his National Guard duty at the
height of the Vietnam War, admission into law school and claims by
former lobbyist Paula Parkinson that he propositioned her eight
years ago during a golf vacation in Florida with two other
congressmen.
   Ms. Parkinson told Playboy magazine she rebuffed Quayle's
advances during the vacation because she was there with then-U.S.
Rep. Tom Evans, a Delaware Republican.
   ``We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and
suggestively,'' Ms. Parkinson told the magazine about Quayle,
according to excerpts of the forthcoming article released Tuesday.
``He said he wanted to make love.''
   Washington attorney Glenn Lewis, who represented Ms. Parkinson
when she was questioned by the FBI in 1981, said Playboy's account
agreed with what she told the FBI.
   But Quayle said he had ``nothing to do with her,'' adding,
``This is just getting a little bit outrageous and I'm getting a
little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another.''
   Dukakis spent Tuesday campainging in his home state of
Massachusetts, where he borrowed Bush's line about ``voodoo
economics'' to criticize the vice president's budget plan.
   ``There is no Republican plan,'' Dukakis said. ``The vice
president is talking about a flexible freeze. That's like a melting
ice cube. ... That's the son of voodoo economics.'' Bush criticized
Ronald Reagan's economic proposals as ``voodoo economics'' in 1980
when the two were competing for the GOP presidential nomination.
   Dukakis also questioned Bush's support for mandatory recitation
of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, saying the vice president
was unfit to run for president if he would sign such legislation
after being told by a court that it was unconstitutional.
   Bush continued to enjoy post-convention gains in the polls.
   A new Gallup poll said Bush was leading Dukakis, 48 percent to
44 percent, among registered voters. However, the survey had a
margin of error of 3 percentage points, meaning that either figure
could be off by that much. Gallup contacted 1,000 likely voters
last weekend immediately following the Republican National
Convention.
   There also were signs of progress being made on a debate
schedule between the two presidential contenders, with Dukakis
campaign chairman Paul Brountas to meet with his counterpart in the
Bush campaign, James A. Baker III, early next week to discuss
arrangements.
   A new account of Quayle's entry into the Indiana National Guard
also surfaced.
   Retired Major Gen. Alfred Ahner, former military support officer
for Indiana and later head of the state's National Guard, said he
was contacted by an old friend, Wendell Phillippi, a retired Guard
commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by Quayle's family.
   Ahner said in a telephone interview from Indiana that after
Phillippi called him, he checked with personnel. ``They said they
had a couple spaces,'' he said. ``I said hold one of them, there's
a good guy coming over.''
   Quayle insisted there was no influence applied, because ``when I
applied there were openings and after I applied there were
openings.''
   One Indiana Guard report indicated that the Guard was
overextended in mid-1969, but a month-by-month breakdown made
available Tuesday showed that Quayle's specific unit did have a
handful of openings when he joined up in May, and in the months
before and after.
   The Bush campaign is backing away from Bush's declaration that
one of his ``missions'' as president would be to create 30 million
new jobs in eight years, the New York Times reported today.
   Robert Zoellick, senior economic adviser on the Bush campaign
staff, said Bush used the figure in his acceptance speech for the
Republican presidential nomination to express a general goal rather
than to promise 30 million new jobs.

<HEAD>Military Families Move Inside Bases In Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department has reduced by 54
percent the number of military families living outside U.S. bases
in Panama over the past five months, officials said Wednesday.
   The effort to move as many military families as possible inside
U.S. bases in the troubled Central American nation has been aided
by a growing number of servicemen deciding to accept so-called
``unaccompanied tours'' rather than bring families with them.
   Pentagon officials say they have no precise statistics available
on that trend, but add that on-base housing has been freed up this
summer at an unusual rate compared to years past, making it
possible to move more families in from civilian homes.
   According to Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman, there were
2,450 military families living off-post in Panama City as of March
1. That number had been cut to 1,134 as of Aug. 1, and efforts are
continuing to find space for as many more as possible, she said.
   ``We think we can do more,'' the spokeswoman said of the
movements. ``There are clearly people choosing not to take their
families to Panama, and that helps free housing.''
   Although the Pentagon has been working to move dependents to
base housing for months, the effort has taken on more momentum this
summer because of what the United States has described as a
deliberate campaign of harassing Americans.
   U.S. officials in Panama City reported last Sunday that
Americans had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by
Panamanian authorities this year, including stoppage of mail and
attempts to extort bribes for traffic violations.
   The United States is continuing to press economic sanctions
against Panama in a bid to oust military leader Manuel A. Noriega.
Noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on
drug trafficking charges.
   Panama is the home of the U.S. Southern Command, the
organization responsible for all U.S. military forces in Central
and South America. There are about 10,000 American servicemen
stationed permanently in Panama, plus about 2,200 servicemen who
have been assigned there on a temporary basis since spring to
upgrade security at American bases.

   The daughter of the late soul singer
Jackie Wilson was slain in what police said was an apparent
drug-related shooting.
   Jacqueline Wilson, 37, was shot in the back Monday outside a
store, Detective Hubert Yopp said Tuesday. No arrests were made.
   The slaying is believd drug-related because of the amount of
narcotics trafficking in the area and because the people Wilson
associated with had drug connections, Yopp said.
   Jackie Wilson, whose hits included ``Lonely Teardrops,'' ``To Be
Loved,'' and ``(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,''
died in 1984 at age 49. He had been in a coma for nine years after
suffering a heart attack and brain damage while performing.
   Ms. Wilson was the third of his children to die unexpectedly. In
1977, Sandra Wilson Abrams died of a heart attack at 24; in 1970,
Jackie Wilson Jr., 16, was shot to death.

<HEAD>The National Guard: Much Changed Since Sgt. Quayle's Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID L. LANGFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Guard these days is no good place
to hide from a war.
   In the years since Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle joined the Guard in Indiana in 1969, America's oldest
military organization has been made a full partner in the national
defense with the regular Army.
   Under the Pentagon's Total Force battle plan, which came to
fruition in the Reagan years, some National Guardsmen would be on
the front lines in a war in just a few days, with most of the rest
of Guard combat units to follow within 30 to 60 days.
   Some would reach the battlefield even before their regular Army
counterparts.
   ``It was not but a few years ago that they said we couldn't
fight our way out of a wet paper bag, and here we're on the
spearhead of an invasion,'' says Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr.,
chief of the National Guard Bureau, the liaison with the Defense
Department. ``Baby, we've come a long way. And seeing the kids out
there, I don't know of any that say, `Hell, no, I won't go.'''
   Even with the threat of being drafted no longer a factor _
conscription ended in 1972 _ the Guard is at its greatest strength
in its 352-year history, with 451,900 soldiers in 2,043 units,
greater even than during the Vietnam War.
   The militia that first fought for its homeland at Bunker Hill
and has fought in every American war has also emerged into an
``International Guard.'' Over the past few years half a million
Guardsmen have trained overseas _ in Asia, Europe, Greenland and
Africa, as well as South America and Central America.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Minnesota Gov. Rudy
Perpich went to court to block the dispatch of their states'
Guardsmen to Central America, but failed.
   Under an Army battle plan called Capstone, National Guardsmen
and Army Reservists will comprise roughly half the manpower of the
Total Force in event of war.
   ``The Army cannot go to war without the National Guard and they
recognize this,'' says Maj. Gen. Donald Burdick, director of the
Army National Guard. ``Today's Guard is considered a full partner
with the active component in the Total Force.''
   While the Capstone strategy was worked out in the late 1970s, it
was not until the military buildup during the Reagan years that the
National Guard, which once trained with hand-me-down weapons, was
properly equipped. After the Vietnam War, many of the units were
down to less than 65 percent of their authorized strength.
   The Guard now has units with the latest weaponry, such as the
Abrams M-1 Tank, the M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Roland
Air Defense missile, and most units are at 90 percent or better of
their authorized strength.
   ``The Georgia Guard received the new Abrams tank before the
active component,'' Burdick says. ``Now this sends a hell of a
signal to that young man out there in the Guard as to his
importance today.''
   The Air National Guard is also at record strength, with 114,600
in 642 units.
   The Reserve Forces Policy Board, an advisory group for the
Defense Department, says that, among other things, the Air Guard is
responsible for providing air defense on a daily basis for most of
the continental United States and Puerto Rico. It is solely
responsible for the air defense of Hawaii.
   ``National Guard air defense units provide 78 percent of the air
defense assets for the United States, with two fighter-interceptors
on 24-hour alert at each of 22 locations,'' says the board.
   Air Guard tankers provided air-to-air refueling for the strikes
on Grenada and Libya.
   ``We were ready 10 years ago, but it was kind of a paper-thin
combat readiness, whereas today the Air Guard is in basically the
very same first-line equipment that the active Air Force is in _
F15s, F16s, brand new C-130s,'' says Maj. Gen. John B. Conaway,
director of the Air National Guard.
   CW3 George Howard Lloyd, an IBM technician from Plant City,
Fla., is a radar operator with Florida's 53rd Infantry Brigade, the
``Gator Brigade'' that is assigned to defend the Panama Canal. He
first joined the Guard 40 years ago at age 16 and saw combat in
Korea.
   ``Brother, there ain't no comparison between now and what it
used to be,'' he says. ``We used to meet once a week and play
cards. Now we hit the ground running.''
   The National Guard is the only military organization of its kind
in the world, with a dual role as a state militia and a federal
defense force.
   Frequently called on to assist in emergencies such as natural
disasters or riots, the Guard has been given more responsibility in
helping curb drug traffic.
   The National Guard, which traces its heritage to four militia
regiments organized in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on Dec. 13,
1636, has seen duty in every American war since the Pequot Indian
War of 1637. The term ``National Guard'' was first used in America
by a New York militia unit on Aug. 25, 1824.
   Eighteen of the country's 38 presidents, from George Washington
to Harry S. Truman, were members of the National Guard or the
militias that were the Guard's predecessors.
   During World War I, the Guard supplied 17 combat divisions,
379,071 soldiers, or about 40 percent of the American Expeditionary
Forces. The records of the German High Command noted that of the
eight American divisions considered the best, six were National
Guard divisions.
   In World War II, of the first five U.S. Army divisions to enter
offensive combat, four were National Guard. Among the 300,034
Guardsmen who served in the war, 20 received Congressional Medals
of Honor.
   In the Korean War, 183,600 Army and Air Guardsmen were called to
active duty.
   But of the 3.4 million American servicemen and women sent to
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, only 22,745 were Guardsmen.
President Lyndon Johnson felt large-scale call-ups of reservists
for extended periods would lead to more public pressure to ``bring
the boys home.''

   Burma's president lifted martial law
today and said the ruling party would consider letting the people
decide whether to return to multi-party democracy, state radio
reported.
   ``General elections will be held as soon as possible'' if the
people vote for a multi-party system in a referendum, and top
government officials will not run in the elections, said President
Maung Maung.
   Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters marched
through Rangoon, Burma's capital, a Western diplomat and news
reports said. It was the third straight day of mass protest against
Burma's one-party government and the largest since military rule
was imposed in 1962.
   Maung Maung said the Burma Socialist Program Party would meet
Sept. 12 to consider holding a referendum on multi-party rule,
Radio Rangoon reported in a broadcast monitored in Bangkok.
   He said he and the 13 other members of the Central Executive
Committee would step down if the party decided not to hold the
referendum.
   If the party does agree to put the issue to the people,
Parliament would amend the Constitution at an emergency session the
next day to pave the way for holding the referendum, the radio said.
   If elections are held, ``neither I nor any personnel of the
State Council, the Council of Ministers, the Council of People's
Justices, the Council of People's Attorneys and the Council of
People's Inspectors will run,'' Maung Maung said.
   Longtime strongman Ne Win, who toppled the elected government in
1962 and instituted authoritarian rule, proposed a referendum on
multi-party rule in a speech to the party at an emergency session
when he resigned July 23.
   Two days later, the proposal was rejected by party members who
were ``attached to the one-party system,'' Maung Maung said today.
   The Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
today's demonstration ``attracted from several hundred thousand to
up to 1 million'' people in Rangoon, a city of 3.5 million.
   ``They were marching and chanting ``Down with Socialism!'' and
``We Want Democracy!'' he said.
   Another Western diplomat, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Maung Maung went today to see Ne Win, who
still appeared to be pulling strings behind the scenes.
   Radio Rangoon said Maung Maung signed decrees lifting martial
law in Rangoon and in Prome, a town 150 miles north of the capital.
An order signed by Brig. Gen. Myo Nyunt, the Rangoon area
commander, withdrew the military administration from the capital,
it said.
   Former leader Sein Lwin imposed martial law on Rangoon on Aug. 3
after anti-government demonstrations. Ne Win imposed it on Prome on
July 22 after mobs destroyed houses and shops there.
   No violence was reported in Rangoon as demonstrators led by
students and Buddhist monks gathered in the morning outside Rangoon
General Hospital, the main rallying place since troops shot medical
personnel there during earlier rioting.
   Diplomats said demonstrators marched from the hospital past the
U.S. Embassy for five or six hours. They dispersed peacefully after
Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of independence leader Gen. Aung San,
addressed them at the hospital.
   ``She urged calm and discipline and non-violence to bring about
democratic rule,'' one Western diplomat said. ``They're calling for
Friday to possibly be the biggest day ever, a general strike and
huge demos.''
   An Asian diplomat said Aung San Suu Kyi called for a united
front against the government and a rally by 1 million people to
demand full democracy. She lives in England with her husband and is
visiting Rangoon.
   About 5,000 people sat outside the U.S. Embassy today listening
to speeches over loudspeakers, the first Western diplomat said.
   ``The speakers have been writers, artists, lawyers, doctors and
nurses,'' and the demonstrators sent frequent messages to the
embassy asking for support, he said.
   Soldiers went to the embassy, ``but they were
non-confrontational, staying behind barbed-wire barricades,'' he
said. Troops also were at intersections and other areas.
   When the decree lifting martial law in Rangoon was announced,
the soldiers ``got on trucks and left. There was great cheering,
clapping and blowing of horns,'' the diplomat said.
   He also cited reports that six demonstrators were shot and
wounded by security personnel in Moulmein, 45 miles southeast of
Rangoon, but he had no details and the report could not be
confirmed.
   Hundreds of thousands of people across Burma took to the streets
from Aug. 8 to Aug. 12 to protest the transfer of power from Ne Win
to Sein Lwin, widely hated in Burma for suppressing dissent.
   The government said clashes with security forces left 112 people
dead and 267 wounded in Rangoon alone. But diplomats say hundreds
of people may have died in the protests before Sein Lwin's
resignation Aug. 12 after 17 days in power.
   The new government has freed more than 600 people arrested
during the rioting. Several prominent figures remain in custody,
including Aung Gyi, Burma's leading dissident, and Sein Win, the
Burma correspondent of The Associated Press.

   A small earthquake rattled a section of
northeastern Salt Lake City, but was not related to a series of
tremors which shook central Utah earlier this month, seismologists
said.
   The quake, measuring 2.1 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
occurred at 11:13 p.m. MDT on Tuesday, said Linda Hall of the
University of Utah Seismograph Stations.
   No damage or injuries were reported, she said.
   Hall said the temblor occurred along the Wasatch Fault, a series
of unstable geoological formations along the Wasatch Mountains
running from northern to central Utah.
   On Aug. 14, three quakes rolled through central Utah and western
Colorado, the largest measuring 5.6 magnitude. No injuries or major
property damage were reported.

<TEXT>
   Nearly two decades after the Woodstock rock
festival became a symbol of peace and love for the Baby Boom
generation, the music has been replaced by bickering over whether
there should be an anniversary concert.
   Promoters are squabbling. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor
and bucolic Bethel is still trying to come to grips with its place
in history.
   ``This town doesn't want to forget it,'' said Allan Scott,
Bethel's supervisor. ``The town just doesn't want to get into the
same thing it got into 20 years ago.''
   Max Yasgur's old farm, where 300,000 people converged for three
days in August 1969 to hear musicians like the Who, Jimi Hendrix
and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, isn't a tourist trap, largely
because many people still think it's in Woodstock, 45 miles away.
   The only clue along Route 17B is a small wooden sign advertising
the ``Woodstock Camp Ground'' that points down narrow Hurd Road.
About a mile down the road is a large, sloping field, empty except
for a concrete and steel plaque that identifies its historic past.
   ``Every year more and more people have been assembling at the
site. It's virtually become a shrine,'' said Stephen Davis, lawyer
for the current owners of Yasgur's Farm, Brooklyn auto glass shop
owner Louis Nicky and his wife, June Gelish.
   The Nickys offered the town $200,000 for the right to be host
for another concert in the summer of 1989. Bethel would have to
waive its ordinance forbidding gatherings of more than 10,000
people, passed in 1970.
   No thanks, said the town board.
   ``I walked through it. Besides the drugs, there were sex orgies
all over the place,'' said George Neuhaus, town supervisor during
the original festival. ``I'm 100 percent against (another concert)
and I will do everything I can to prevent it.''
   Other townspeople aren't so harsh.
   ``Of course there was a lot of noisy music and nude people, but
there were a lot of good things too,'' said Marion Vassmer, who
runs a general store that sold supplies to famished concertgoers 19
years ago.
   The small community two hours from New York City, surrounded by
farms and out-of-the-way vacation homes, simply can't handle large
crowds, Scott said.
   The supervisor said he's heard from ``five or six'' promoters
about an anniversary concert. One even offered to pay for a new
sewage and water system for Bethel, but Scott said that after he
asked the promoter to post a letter of credit he never heard from
him again.
   Gelish said the people blocking a concert are simply
old-fashioned.
   ``My husband worked hard all his life, he never had a chance to
be famous,'' Gelish said of 61-year-old Louis Nicky. ``This is his
chance to be famous.''
   Yasgur, who allowed promoters to hold the concert on his farm,
died of a heart attack in 1973 at age 54.
   Joel Rosenman, one of the four promoters of the original
concert, says the Nickys, who bought the property seven years ago,
just want to cash in on a piece of history they had nothing to do
with.
   Rosenman, not coincidentally, wants to promote his own series of
commemorative concerts, but somewhere other than the Catskills.
   Gelish, who vows to continue fighting for a concert, said she
has no other plans for the land. Asked if she could envision a
tourist attraction with the magnitude of Graceland, Elvis Presley's
home, her eyes lit up.
   ``This is really hallowed ground,'' she said.
   Back at the site one afternoon, a man in a tie-dyed T-shirt and
dirty jeans sat cross-legged in the field. A grey-haired man took
video pictures of trees and tall grass swaying in the wind. Mark
Duncan drove up, his North Carolina license plates reading
``WOODSTCK.''
   Duncan, who works at a bank in Charlotte, didn't attend the
original show but drives up each summer because ``it's a nice
feeling around here.''
   Speaking above the blare of 1960s hits from his radio, Duncan
said he's ambivalent about a Woodstock anniversary concert.
   ``If it happens it would be fine,'' he said, ``but I don't think
it would ever be the same.''

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court, reinstating a suit
by a woman who claims she was terrorized by her husband, said
police may have a special responsibility to protect a person who
obtains a restraining order against another.
   The decision Tuesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is
believed to be the first appellate ruling to allow a suit against
police for harm caused by violation of a restraining order.
   The woman, Jena Balistreri of Pacifica, said in her suit that
officers derided her complaints about her husband's violence and
failed to help her.
   Restraining orders _ which generally forbid a person to
approach, contact or harass someone else _ have become common in
domestic violence cases.
   The restraining order in the Balistreri case may have been ``an
affirmative state commitment to protect (the woman) from her
husband's harassment,'' said Judge Betty Fletcher in the 2-1
decision.
   ``While there is, in general, no constitutional duty of (police)
to protect members of the public at large from crime, such a duty
may arise by virtue of a `special relationship' between (police)
and a particular member of the public.''
   A special relationship is found most often when the plaintiff is
in custody and claims a duty by authorities to provide protection
from harm.
   Fletcher said such a relationship may be created when a
plaintiff secures a protective order and tells officers she is
still being harassed.
   In dissent, U.S. District Judge Laughlin Waters said a
restraining order created no legal right to police protection, at
least without proof that the order had been violated.
   He also asked whether the court was conferring ``preferred
status'' on some citizens.
   Todd Roberts, a lawyer for police in Pacifica, declined comment
on the ruling.
   Ms. Balistreri said she got a restraining order against her
husband in 1982 prohibiting him from contacting her after he beat
her severely and after he apparently committed vandalism and made
hundreds of harassing phone calls.
   After the order was issued, she said, he crashed his car into
her garage, and a firebomb was thrown through her window.
   She said police refused to arrest him and suggested after the
firebombing that she move or hire a private investigator. She also
said police responded to her complaints with ridicule and refused
to investigate harassing phone calls she got between 1983 and 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti had dismissed the suit against
the Pacifica police and Chief Al Olsen, saying police had not
violated Ms. Balistreri's rights.

   A Detroit police officer has been charged with
kidnapping and armed robbery in incidents two other officers were
suspected of earlier, authorities said.
   Brian David Crite, 20, was arraigned Tuesday on charges of
kidnapping, armed robbery and use of a firearm in commission of a
crime, a spokesman for Wayne County Prosecutor John D. O'Hair said.
   Magistrate Charles Hammons Sr. ordered him held on $100,000 bond
pending a Sept. 2 preliminary hearing.
   Crite, on the department for two years, was identified Tuesday
by three victims as one of two uniformed men who robbed them Aug.
16 after stopping them with a patrol car, police said.
   If convicted of either kidnapping or armed robbery, he could be
sentenced to life in prison.
   Investigators are looking into complaints that two uniformed men
driving a patrol car robbed at least 10 people Aug. 15 and Aug. 16.
   Two other officers detained in the case last week were suspected
because a patrol car they used the afternoon of Aug. 15 was
reported missing and believed used in the robbery spree. They were
released after victims failed to identify them in a lineup.
   Department spokesmen declined comment on Crite's arrest.

   About 150 parents toured a specially built
glass booth where an AIDS-stricken girl is to be quarantined during
class, but many remained concerned that their children could catch
the deadly virus.
   ``If Eliana Martinez comes here, my daughter won't,'' Robin
Preston declared Tuesday, referring to the mentally retarded
6-year-old who is to attend the Manhattan Exceptional Center under
federal court order.
   ``There's too much unknown to say AIDS is not a communicable
disease,'' he said. ``I'm sorry she has the disease, but why put
all the other children in jeopardy?''
   Earlier this month U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich
ruled that Eliana could attend classes with other children but must
stay in the 6-by-8-foot enclosure outfitted with a toilet and sink
until she becomes toilet-trained and stops sucking her fingers.
   Citing possible emotional damage to Eliana if she is so
isolated, Eliana's lawyers and mother have vowed to keep the child
out of the cubicle.
   Chief U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges ruled today
that until the case can heard by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, Eliana may stay in an at-home instruction
program rather than being put in the booth.
   ``Can you guarantee that the child will not infect our
children?'' one parent asked during Tuesday's forum organized by
the school district and health officials.
   ``No, I can't guarantee, but I can give you the medical
information,'' said Dr. Dennis Ledford, an allergist and professor
at the University of South Florida Medical School. ``A person
walking around with this disease doesn't send it out like
missiles.''
   The fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted
most often by blood or semen, usually through sexual contact or the
sharing of hypodermic needles.
   ``I don't know what I am going to do,'' said Lynette Green,
whose 11-year-old son is one of a dozen children scheduled to
attend class with Eliana. ``I guess I'm kind of scared.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The life story of an American Indian has won a top
non-fiction award in a contest sponsored by a Japanese magazine,
the magazine's publisher said Wednesday.
   Dennis Banks and Yuri Morita, co-authors of ``Sacred Soul,''
were given this year's $7,500 Asahi Journal Non-Fiction Award.
   Ms. Morita, 37, spent five years transcribing and translating
into Japanese the life story of Banks, leader of the American
Indian Movement, an Indian rights organization.
   The story details Banks' struggle for Indian rights and
culminates in his meeting with a fellow Indian in prison.
   Banks, 52, of the Ojibwa tribe in Minnesota, says he published

   Authorities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
have joined forces to search for a man believed to have sexually
assaulted at least 22 women at apartment complex swimming pools
since May.
   Police officers in 11 communities said the man targets lone
women at pools, shows them a small semiautomatic handgun and orders
them to remove their swimsuits and to perform sexual acts. The
suspect then usually orders victims to run away while he steals the
swimsuits.
   Police Lt. K.L. Roe said authorities will have their third joint
meeting this week.
   Farmers Branch Dectective Dave Lemons described the man as
active and persistent. He said when the man has been unsuccessful
in assaulting one woman, he has approached as many as three others
in different cities in as many hours.
   Officials said the joint investigation has tracked details of
the suspect's movements.
   ``The guy is most active on Mondays and Wednesdays, and between
the hours of noon to about 4 p.m., but he has varied the days and
hours on a few occasions,'' Lemons said. ``Besides having an
outdoor fetish, he likes knowing that the police are close behind
him.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Gets AFL-CIO Endorsement, Raps Bush as Economic `Son of
Voodoo'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis picked up
organized labor's endorsement today, criticized the Reagan-Bush
record on creating jobs and said the nation needs ``an economic
leader, not a cheerleader'' for president.
   Dukakis criticized Republican candidate George Bush for failing
to mention budget and trade deficits in his acceptance speech at
the GOP National Convention in New Orleans last week.
   ``And to add insult to injury,'' Dukakis told AFL-CIO union
presidents, ``he wants to cut taxes for the wealthy again. You
know, if this was a movie it would be called `Son of Voodoo'.''
   Dukakis said that while more Americans are working today than at
any time in history, the majority of jobs created under President
Reagan have paid poorly. He said the average weekly wage for jobs
lost between 1979 and 1985 was $440, while the average wage of
replacement jobs was one-third less.
   ``That's the price American workers and families are paying for
eight years of voodoo economics,'' said Dukakis, borrowing a phrase
that Bush himself once used to describe Reagan's economic policies.
   Earlier, the AFL-CIO formally endorsed Dukakis for president, as
expected, with federation president Lane Kirkland charging that the
Reagan administration ``has favored greed over need'' for the past
eight years.
   The giant labor federation's endorsement of the Massachusetts
governor was nearly unanimous. Of its 91 affiliated unions, only
the 30,000-member Air Line Pilots Association, the 40,000-member
Marine Engineers Union and the 1.6-million Teamsters union
abstained from the vote.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration came to Washington charging
that government itself was the problem,'' Kirkland said. ``Eight
years later we know that government is not the problem. The problem
lies with those who govern. This is an administration that has
favored greed over need.''
   Teamster President William McCarthy said his union had not
polled its members but is doing so through its monthly magazine.
Teamster officials said they expect to announce an endorsement in
mid-September.
   The airline pilots said their board of directors had not met on
the issue, and the marine engineers said they were following a long
tradition of not making presidential endorsements.
   The Newspaper Guild cast 21,390 votes or approximately 80
percent of its membership in favor of Dukakis but abstained on
4,000 votes in the membership-weighted tally.
   Guild President Charles Dale said the partial abstention
reflected the policy of the union's Wire Service Guild local in
``disassociating itself from any political endorsements.''
   Dukakis flew here from Boston to address the labor federation
later today, after reviving Republican George Bush's ``voodoo
economics'' line to criticize the vice president's own budget plan.
   Then Dukakis planned two days of campaigning in the big
industrial states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   The Massachusetts governor spent Tuesday wrapping up his annual
trip to his state's northeast communities, but he took time to
deliver some of his harshest criticism to date of Bush, his
Republican rival.
   Dukakis called Bush's flexible-freeze budget plan ``the son of
voodoo economics.'' It was Bush who, during his 1980 GOP primary
campaign, referred to Ronald Reagan's economic proposals as
``voodoo economics.''
   The governor also questioned Bush's support for mandatory
recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, saying the vice
president was unfit to run for president if he would sign such
legislation after being told by a court that it was
unconstitutional.
   In addition, Dukakis reiterated that he was eager to debate
Bush, and there was an indication some progress was being made on
that issue. Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas was to meet
with his counterpart in the Bush campaign, James A. Baker III,
early next week to discuss a debate schedule.
   ``There is no Republican plan'' to erase the federal deficit,
Dukakis said after telling newspaper editors he would balance the
budget within five years by holding the line on defense spending,
cutting some domestic spending and collecting unpaid taxes.
   ``The vice president is talking about a flexible freeze,''
Dukakis said. ``That's like a melting ice cube. ... That's the son
of voodoo economics.''
   Dukakis also lashed back at criticism from Bush and other
Republicans who have attacked his 1977 veto of state legislation
that penalized teachers who refused to lead their students in the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   The governor vetoed the measure after the state's highest court,
citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent, advised him the legislation
was unconstitutional.
   ``I encourage children to say the Pledge of Allegiance,''
Dukakis said. ``I say the Pledge of Allegiance. That's not the
issue. The Republicans know it. ... That law was unconstitutional.
   ``If the vice president of the United States is saying that if
he was president and the United States Supreme Court said the law
was unconstitutional and the attorney general said it was
unconstitutional and he'd have signed it anyway, well, that raises
very serious questions about what it means to take the oath of
office,'' Dukakis said.
   ``You are under a constitutional oath to veto the bill, aren't
you?'' he said. ``Is the vice president suggesting something else?
Is he suggesting he'd sign the bill anyway, having been informed by
the highest court of the land that it was unconstitutional? If he
does that, he has no business running for this office.''
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin criticized Dukakis for failing to
challenge the Massachusetts court's advisory opinion.
   ``Courts rule on constitutionality, not governors,'' Goodin
said. ``The point is if he felt strongly on the issue, he could
have challenged it in court and he decided not to do that.''
   Dukakis also applauded President Reagan for signing major trade
legislation Tuesday, but said Democrats deserved credit for the
measure. Dukakis was quick to point out that his running mate,
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, was the co-sponsor of the Senate bill.
``He was the architect of it,'' Dukakis said.

<HEAD>Korean Talks May Resume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of North Korea and South
Korea said Thursday they are willing to resume talks on sharing
next month's Olympics and a non-aggression pact.
   But there was no clear agreement: North Korea suggested meeting
on Thursday and South Korea proposed a session on Friday.
   Officials at the National Assembly said their chief delegate,
Prk Joon-kyu, met privately with his North Korean counterpart, Chon
Kum Chol, at the truce village of Panmunjom Wednesday. Later in the
day, Seoul telephoned Panmunjom to suggest reopening talks Friday.
   North Korea said in a radio broadcast monitored in Tokyo that
its delegation had proposed meeting on Thursday.
   Park refused to disclose details of Wednesday's meeting. He did
say he expected ``new proposals'' from North Korea, but he admitted
he was not encouraged by Wednesday's meeting.
   Assembly officials were reluctant to predict whether the
deadlocked talks could be revived. But one senior official,
speaking on condition he not be identified, said, ``Neither side
wants to take the blame.''
   Seoul officials say they believe North Korea does not expect a
dramatic breakthough. Instead, they think Panmunjom is trying to
distract world attention from the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their peninsula was
divided at the end of World War.
   The current round of talks, which began Aug. 19, ended in a
stalemate Monday. South Korean delegates said then they hoped to
pospone further contacts until after the Olympics.
   North Korea had called for urgent talks on sharing the Olympics,
but South Korean officials said they were not so enthusiastic about
pursuing the subject when the face-to-face meetings began. The
North Koreans seemed more concerned about a non-aggression pact,
they said.
   These preliminary talks broke up over such basic issues as the
agenda and the number of participants for later negotiations
proposed for the two parliaments. North Korea insists the main
talks include the full legislatures of both sides, which would
involve nearly 1,000 people. South Korea wants delegations of up to
30 lawmakers from each side.
   North Korea also wants the two parliaments to publish a joint
declaration of non-aggression calling for the withdrawal of the
42,000 U.S. troops in South Korea, as well as removal of the
nuclear weapons allegedly in their arsenal. Seoul sees the U.S.
forces as vital to its defenses.
   North Korea has said it would boycott the Olympics unless it can
be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee rejected the
North Korean demand, saying that the Olympics are given to a single
city and cannot be shared.

   Organs found floating in the city sewer
treatment plant are believed to be human, but should not pose a
public health threat, officials said Wednesday.
   The organs were found Tuesday in a filter designed to keep
solids from entering the treatment process at the Sanitary District
plant. They were taken to St. Margaret Hospital and Health Centers
for analysis.
   Dr. Tieh Wang, who heads the hospital's chemical laboratory,
said he was ``99.9 percent sure they are human organs,'' but said
they also could be from a deer or cow.
   Wang said the tissue did not appear to present a health threat.
   The organs, one colon and the others unidentified, will be
stored for three to six months at the hospital as a precaution and
then disposed of as solid waste. It was not clear how many organs
were found.
   Tom Gordon, acting superintendent at the treatment plant, said
it is not uncommon to find organs in the sewage treatment system.

   The State Department said today it was
``shocked'' by Israel's decision to expel 25 Palestinian activists,
and a senior diplomat said that relations between the two countries
might be damaged if the expulsions continue.
   The warning was conveyed Monday by Deputy Secretary of State
John Whitehead to Israel's charge d'affaires Oded Eran, said an
Israeli source, declining to be further identified.
   Israeli Embassy spokesman Yossi Gal confirmed the meeting took
place but declined to discuss its contents.
   Eran, who is in charge of the embassy while Ambassador Moshe
Arad is on vacation, was summoned to the State Department after
Israel announced it would expel 25 Palestinians accused of fueling
the violence which has claimed more than 250 Palestinian lives in
the past eight months.
   Whitehead ``was emphatic about the U.S. position that it objects
to these expulsions,'' said the source.
   ``He said relations could be damaged if this goes on,'' the
source added.
   ``We are shocked by the government of Israel's decision to expel
an additional 25 Palestinians,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley.
   She said that if Israel carries out the deportation orders, it
will bring to 60 the number of Palestinians expelled this year from
the Israeli-occupied territories. The expulsions can be appealed to
the Israeli Supreme Court, although all the orders have been upheld
this year.
   The growing number of expulsions appears to indicate that
deportations ``are the norm rather than the exception,'' she added.
   Israel contends that it uses expulsions only as a last resort to
ensure public order is maintained in the territories. It has
accused those expelled of fueling the Palestinian uprising that
began last December.
   Israel argues that it is entitled to deport Palestinians in
accordance with international law governing occupying powers, as
well as under British emergency laws applied by the government in
the West Bank and Gaza.
   But Mrs. Oakley repeated the U.S. view that deportations are not
legal under the Geneva human rights accords, which govern the
conduct of occupying powers, and called on Israel to charge and try
Palestinians rather than expel them.
   Expulsions only exacerbate the situation and increase tensions
between Israelis and Palestinians, she said.
   Nonetheless, Mrs. Oakley reaffirmed the strong ties between the
two countries, saying ``our friendship and close association with
Israel continue.''
   Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid, getting $3
billion annually in economic and military support funds.

<HEAD>Superpowers Open Review Conference on ABM Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Soviet conference reviewing the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty opened Wednesday after both sides
linked progress at separate weapons reduction talks to full
compliance with the ABM accord.
   Superpower delegates held two meetings Wednesday, one in the
morning and one in the afternoon, said U.S. spokesman Terry
Shroeder. He said he had no details of what was discussed.
   The first full meeting, or plenary, of both delegations is
scheduled for Thursday at the U.S. diplomatic mission. The U.S.
delegation is headed by Maj. Gen. William Burns, head of the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Soviet side by top
disarmament official Viktor Karpov.
   The conference is the third such meeting held since the ABM
treaty went into effect. Under the accord, such meetings must be
held every five years.
   The ABM treaty restricts each side to deploying only one ABM
system, comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. The aim is
to prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protective
network under the theory that neither would launch a nuclear attack
if it feared devastating retaliation.
   The United States maintains that a Soviet radar under
construction in Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, violates the treaty
because it is not located on the periphery of the country, facing
outward, as the treaty stipulates that missile tracking radars must
be.
   The United States has also voiced concern at Soviet deployment
last year of two other radars in Gomel, near Kiev, saying they also
violate the treaty.
   An information sheet distributed by the U.S. mission says U.S.
officials recently told the Soviets that unless the Krasnoyarsk
radar is dismantled, no agreement is possible at separate
negotiations on reducing strategic, or intercontinental, nuclear
forces. This was apparently the first time the U.S. side made such
a linkage.
   The Soviets have for years linked progress in the strategic
weapons negotiations to limits on the Reagan administration's
space-based missile defense system.
   The Soviets have said that some research on the system,
officially known as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly
called ``Star Wars,'' violates the ABM treaty, but their public
statements have not made clear where they draw the line. The U.S.
has rejected the Soviet call for limits on the program.
   U.S. officials in Washington said early this month that the
chief U.S. aim at the review conference would be to get the Soviet
side to ``correct its violations of the ABM treaty.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that if the Soviet
position on Krasnoyarsk does not change at the review conference,
``the president will consult with the Congress and our allies
concerning next steps.''
   Karpov, the Soviet delegation chief, said upon arrival Saturday
that his side is prepared to discuss the Krasnoyarsk radar. He said
the Soviets were ``ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent
adherence to the ABM treaty.''
   Moscow will insist on ``the preservation of the ABM treaty
intact as it was signed in 1972,'' he said, apparently referring to
the Soviet position that the ``Star Wars'' program threatens the
treaty.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Man Guilty In Flag-Burning Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal jury today convicted a man of burning
an American flag outside an armed forces recruiting station during
a demonstration.
   William C. Cary Jr., a 22-year-old member of the Naval Reserve,
could receive up to a year in prison. No sentencing date was set.
He remained free on $1,000 bond.
   Cary testified Tuesday that he set fire to the flag in
Minneapolis in March to show his discontent with President Reagan's
decision to send troops to Honduras.
   ``I don't necessarily agree with what my government was doing,
but that doesn't make me less of an American or less of a
patriot,'' said Cary, who at the time of his arrest worked in a
used clothing store.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Anderson said the act was a show of
contempt for the flag. ``This case is not about political
beliefs,'' he told the jury.
   ``There are ways one can be legally contemptuous,'' he said.
``One can stand on a podium and shout or sing. But Congress has
said that for certain reasons you can't be contemptuous of the
flag.''
   Cary, dressed in garb made from a U.S. flag, was arrested during
a large protest in which demonstrators used bowling balls and rocks
to break windows at the recruiting office. He was charged with
burning a flag in public.
   Cary testified that a woman he didn't know handed him one end of
a flag she was carrying and asked for his help in burning it. He
said he used his own lighter and he and the woman laid the burned
flag in front of the recruiting office doorway.
   ``It seemed like an appropriate gesture,'' he testified. ``I
knew there were cameras there. I knew I could get people's
attention that way.''
   Anderson said proceedings are under way to expel Cary from the
Naval Reserve, of which he has been a member since age 18.

   A federal judge ordered the city to return a
black boy to his white foster parents, saying that deciding the
child's placement on non-racial grounds will encourage treatment of
people as individuals.
   U.S. District Judge John Hannum ruled Tuesday that 5-year-old
Raymond Bullard, now living with the Rev. Willie Williams and his
wife, Elaine, who are black, should be returned to the home of John
and Marilyn McLaughlin.
   The child lived with the McLaughlins between age 5 months and 2{
years.
   ``Deciding Raymond's placement, not on the basis of his race,
but on the quality of his relationships, will advance the strong
public interest in overcoming racial discrimination and will
promote the goal that citizens be treated according to their
individual human qualities,'' Hannum wrote.
   The judge said the youngster received quality care from both
sets of foster parents, but he concluded the boy had become
emotionally tied to the McLaughlins, became depressed after being
removed from their care and would suffer irreparable harm if not
returned to them.
   ``It is evident that use of race as a sole criterion in making
proper long-term foster care placements of black foster children is
inadequate,'' Hannum wrote.
   ``Factors such as the ability of foster parents, black or white,
to care for the child, to provide a safe, secure and stable home to
the child, etc., must be examined in making determinations of this
kind.''
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she was ``tickled pink'' by the decision.
``Just to have him home in our arms, what else can we tell you?''
   Willliams said he did not believe it was in Raymond's best
interest to be moved again. He said the child was well adjusted and
was part of his family. He said he and his wife wanted to discuss
the ruling with their attorney before deciding whether to appeal.
   Raymond was placed with the McLaughlins in 1983 by Catholic
Social Services, a non-profit foster care agency under contract to
the Philadelphia Department of Human Services.
   Catholic Social Services said the placement would be for six
months, then the boy would be returned to his natural mother. But
his mother, who had emotional problems, was deemed not ready to
resume caring for the child at the end of the six months, and
Raymond remained with the McLaughlin family.
   In 1985, however, Catholic Social Services advised the
department that Raymond should be removed from the McLaughlins and
placed with a black family to comply with the city agency's policy.
The child subsequently was placed with the Williamses.
   Williams, a board member of Catholic Social Services, said the
agency told him they had viewed Raymond's placement with the
McLaughlins as short-term care and the boy's placement with the
Williamses as a long-term solution.
   ``There's no set policy'' on placing children with foster
parents of a different race, said Virginia Durkin-Asti, spokeswoman
for the Philadelphia Catholic archdiocese, which runs Catholic
Social Services. ``We match children to families according to who
is best able to help the child. Each case is individual.''
   The Human Services Department denied it used race as the sole
factor in placing Raymond.
   But Hannum disagreed, and said using race as the sole criterion
was unconstitutional.
   He granted the injunction the McLaughlins requested, directing
the department to submit a plan to return the child to the
McLaughlins within two months.
   The judge said the evidence showed the boy would benefit from
returning to the McLaughlin home and would be harmed
psychologically if not returned.
   The judge added, however, the plan should give the boy contact
with the Williams family.
   Hannum noted that the McLaughlins live in a racially integrated
neighborhood and had pledged to the court that Raymond would attend
a racially integrated school near their home.
   ``This court is satisfied that Raymond ... will have every
opportunity to develop a positive sense of racial identity.''

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank 14.9 percent
from April through June, helped by a record high level of exports
and the first quarterly decline in imports in three years, the
government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the difference between what America
spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of $29.9 billion in
the second quarter, compared to a deficit of $35.2 billion in the
first three months of 1988.
   That was the biggest quarterly improvement in more than five
years, and continued a trend which began after the deficit hit a
record $41.2 billion in the October-December quarter.
   For the first six months of this year, the trade deficit, on a
balance of payments basis, has been running at an annual rate of
$130.2 billion, down almost 20 percent from the record $160.3
billion deficit suffered in 1987.
   Some economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by
close to 25 percent for the year as a whole, marking the first
annual improvement since President Reagan took office.
   ``We have had a very good six months for trade. It has taken a
long time, but the trade deficit is finally turning around,'' said
David Wyss, chief financial economist with Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   Democrats have tried to make the country's soaring trade
deficits in the 1980s a campaign issue, but Republicans are hoping
the voters will focus instead on this year's improvement, which has
made U.S. manufacturing one of the standouts of the economy.
   The new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in the
department's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures
showed the trade deficit declining 12.8 percent to $32.6 billion in
the second quarter, compared to $37.4 billion in the first quarter.
   Wednesday's figures are smaller because they subtract such
factors as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly
numbers.
   The new report said that imports edged down 0.8 percent to
$109.6 billion in the April-June quarter, the first quarterly
decline since the first three months of 1985. While imports of
petroleum products were up by 2.6 percent to $10.2 billion, non-oil
imports fell 1.1 percent, reflecting a big drop in car shipments as
Americans began to balk at higher sticker prices caused by the
weaker dollar.
   Foreign car imports from countries other than Canada fell by 12
percent in the second quarter, led by a 25 percent decline in
shipments from West Germany. South Korean car shipments fell by 19
percent while Japanese car imports were down 7 percent.
   Average prices for German cars shot up 21 percent in the second
quarter while the average price of Japanese cars rose by 3 percent.
   U.S. exports climbed 5.8 percent to a record $79.7 billion in
the second quarter, reflecting in part a 48 percent surge in U.S.
aircraft sales.
   Agricultural exports were up as well, climbing 7 percent to $9.7
billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 1984.
   Corn sales climbed 27 percent, with much of the gain attributed
to increased sales to the Soviet Union and Mexico. Wheat sales were
up 10 percent due to an increase in sales to China while meat and
poultry shipments rose 28 percent, largely due to increased
Japanese purchases.
   Soybean and wheat prices both rose 13 percent while corn prices
were up 7 percent. Analysts said even larger price increases would
be seen in coming months since the spring advance did not reflect
the impact of the summer drought.
   The trade deficit decreased with every major geographic area
except for Canada, the country's largest trading partner, where the
imbalance climbed by $500 million to $4.1 billion.
   The country's largest deficit, as usual, was with Japan, an
imbalance of $11.9 billion, down $1.1 billion from the first
quarter.
   The deficit with Latin American decreased $1.5 billion to $1.7
billion while the deficit with Western Europe fell $900 million to
$3.8 billion. The deficit with the newly industrialized countries
of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong declined $700
million to $6.1 billion.

<HEAD>Jessica Hahn Signs 30-Day Contract With Radio Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual liaison with
Jim Bakker led to the PTL evangelist's downfall, has signed a
30-day contract to work as an on-air personality at a radio station
here, Playboy announced today.
   Ms. Hahn will begin work Monday as part of the morning team of
announcers at KOY-FM, the Top 40 station said through an
advertising agency.
   Diane Lane, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not disclose
terms of the contract.
   However, Bill Farley, a spokesman for Playboy Enterprises in Los
Angeles, said that Ms. Hahn was signed to a 30-day contract with an
option to renew and that the deal included housing and ``very
adequate'' compensation.
   Ms. Hahn appears in the current issue of Playboy, which includes
nude photographs of her following breast-enlargement and other
cosmetic surgery.
   KOY-FM ranks near the bottom in audience share for metropolitan
Phoenix and has played elaborate pranks in its search for publicity.
   Farley said the offer to Ms. Hahn was made because ``people tend
to like her on the air.''
   ``Obviously, there's publicity value involved, but it's mostly
for the station,'' he said. ``She doesn't need publicity. All she
has to do is walk down the street if she wants publicity.''

   A father whose children repeatedly have been
suspended from school for preaching at its gates has not ruled out
legal action against the system, which has agreed the young
evangelists can be taught at home.
   David Strode said in an interview Wednesday his children _
Duffey, 11, Pepper, 7 and Matthew, 6 _ will be removed from
Eastfield Elementary School. But he said he will not sign a
document releasing the system from possible legal action.
   ``McDowell County schools rejected the Bible, so I reject
them,'' he said.
   Strode, himself a street preacher, said he and his children will
continue preaching, although he said he expects the town ``to take
some kind of action'' in response.
   ``They're trying to shut me down,'' he said.
   Under North Carolina law, Strode has 30 days to set up a
home-education plan.
   Strode, 40, an unemployed machinist, had said he didn't want to
run a home school, but he said Wednesday it appeared to be the only
solution.
   ``I'm just glad they (the children) are out of there,'' he said.
   The children are happy with the decision, Strode said.
   ``The problem ain't the kids,'' he said. ``It's the parents and
the teachers. It's hard to fool kids. Parents' hearts are much
harder. An adult's conscience is much harder than a child's.''
   The decision to take the children out of school came after
daylong negotiations between school officials and Caleb Campaign, a
Chicago-based Christian civil rights organization representing the
Strodes.
   ``We pretty much got what everybody wanted,'' said Dan Rodden,
president of Caleb Campaign.
   Rodden said his organization would help with the home education
program and even help Strode find a job.
   The Strode children's first day of school Monday lasted less
than a minute and ended with Duffey being suspended for 10 days. At
the school gate, Duffey and Matthew began to shout Bible verses and
Pepper yelled ``Repent.''

   Few donors to Wheaton College have cashed
in on the offer by New England's oldest women's college to refund
$16 million in donations to anyone unhappy about its decision to
admit men.
   As of Wednesday, 54 donors had been refunded $126,000, said Lisa
Byrnes, a Wheaton spokeswoman.
   The 54 include six who went to court claiming they had been
deceived into donating to a 150th anniversary fund-raising campaign
by a college they thought would remain women-only.
   In a settlement approved in June by Bristol Probate Court,
Wheaton agreed to refund $120,000 to the donors who went to court
and to write to 3,800 other donors offering to return donation. The
offer expires Aug. 31.
   The liberal arts college founded in 1834 has about 1,100
students. In September it will admit 74 men in a 407-member
first-year class.

   Ford Motor Co. today introduced a 1989
Thunderbird with a longer wheelbase and wider tread width and a
Cougar that rides an inch closer to the ground.
   In addition, a supercharged, 3.8-liter, V-6 engine is available
on some models of the two cars.
   ``Ford is again going to have the hottest cars,'' said auto
analyst Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San
Francisco.
   However, Glantz said Ford's plans to increase capacity may cut
into its sales, which set an industry record at $1.66 billion
during the second quarter of this year.
   Ford said the 1989 Thunderbird, which led the way five years ago
when the company moved toward automotive aerodynamic styling, will
have a 9-inch longer wheelbase and wider tread width than the year
before.
   The Mercury Cougar wheelbase is 9 inches longer, too, but its
overall length is 2 inches shorter.
   Other Ford and Lincoln-Mercury models introduced today in
Cambridge, Mass., by Ford executives showed more subtle changes, if
any.
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York
said Ford's strong sales and production concerns accounted for the
relatively few changes.
   Ford is the nation's second-leading automaker behind General
Motors Corp.
   The Big Three automakers _ GM, Ford and Chrysler Motors Corp. _
will be introducing new models through September.

<HEAD>Strikers Close Gdansk Port; Police Convoy Heads Toward City</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New 2nd graf with strike at Nowa Huta steelworks. </NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Strikers closed down the last section of
the Gdansk port today and a convoy of more than 60 police vehicles
and water cannons headed toward the city along the main road from
Warsaw.
   About 1,000 workers went on strike today at the Nowa Huta
steelworks outside Krakow, where a strike attempt fizzled after a
few hours Monday, said worker leader Maciej Mach. A police raid
ended a major strike at the 30,000-worker mill in May.
   Riot police smashed barricades to break up a strike at a
southern coal mine and cleared strikers from an idled bus depot in
Szczecin. Two coal mines ended strikes peacefully, but opposition
sources said a coal mine and a cement factory joined more than a
dozen workplaces on strike.
   Confronted by an 8-day-old series of job actions posing the
stiffest challenge to its rule since 1981, the Politburo urged
Communist Party members ``to counter attempts to stir illegal
strikes,'' the state-run PAP news agency reported.
   The stoppages have idled coal mines and factories employing
about 100,000 workers. The strikers demand legalization of the
Solidarity trade union movement, reinstatement of workers fired for
union activity and wage increases.
   PAP said the Politburo also decided to convene an extraordinary
meeting of the policy-making Central Committee ``in the nearest
future.''
   Section 2 of the Gdansk port, a cargo-loading division that was
the only one in the city still working, joined the strikes today,
government and opposition spokesmen said.
   Near Elblag, about 50 miles southeast of Gdansk, a long column
of police vehicles assembled along the main highway leading to
Gdansk, said Western reporters driving to Warsaw.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, taking part in a strike since
Monday at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, rallied today with strikers
there and at two nearby shipyards.
   ``It is you, the young people, who will renew Solidarity and
renew the country,'' Walesa exhorted youthful strikers at the
Repair Shipyard, according to a tape of the rally given to
reporters.
   In Szczecin, police today routed strikers from a bus depot, said
Jozef Kowalczyk, spokesman for the Inter-Factory Strike Committee
in the Baltic port. Polish television showed sullen bus drivers
quietly marching away from the depot after a police commander said
his men would use force if they remained. It did not show police
using force.
   On Monday, police raided three depots around the city and
arrested strikers, and only one depot remained on strike today.
Army troops continued to operate some buses.
   Police evicted 150 strikers from the Miesko mine in the Silesian
town of Walbrzych in an assault Tuesday evening, said Robert Kozak
of the Solidarity Information Commission.
   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said a group of ``party
activists, management and workers'' accompanied by police
intervened to end the strike, and he denied that police played an
active role.
   But at another mine in the Silesian coal fields, about 125
miners Tuesday blocked themselves 580 yards underground in a shaft
near the curfew-bound southern town of Jastrzebie.
   The miners pledged to stay underground at the 30 Years of
People's Poland mine ``until the end of their lives, until all the
demands are met,'' said Wojciech Maziarski, a Solidarity spokesman
in Warsaw.
   Meanwhile, strikes ended peacefully at the Lenin mine in
Myslowice and the Victoria mine in Walbrzych, PAP said.
   But Kozak said the Knurow mine in Gliwice in the south and the
Dzialoszyn cement works in Wielun in central Poland joined the
strikes today. Straus said he had no information on the strikes.
   In another development, Zbigniew Bujak, a former underground
Solidarity leader, made a dash for his motorcycle during the night
and escaped police watchers stationed outside his Warsaw-area home
since Sunday, said his wife Waclawa.
   The Politburo issued a communique saying speedy changes must be
made to correct the country's economic policies. The government has
raised prices 40 percent this year and wages have lagged far behind
inflation.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said at least 49 people have
been detained in connection with the strikes.
   Walesa appealed again Tuesday for dialogue with authorities to
end the strikes, but the government, which has declared the strikes
illegal, refused. Communist authorities stifled Solidarity in a
December 1981 military crackdown, and it was outlawed the following
year.
   ``There will be no political talks under the `pistol' of a
strike,'' Urban told a Warsaw news conference.
   He did not rule out declaring a state of emergency in the
affected provinces: ``The measures that will be applied will be
adequate to developments.''
   Urban said a special Parliament commission will meet Aug. 31 to
review the government's economic policies.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak announced Monday that troops
would be sent to secure major industrial plants, though none were
in evidence at the plants on Tuesday.
   An 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was imposed Tuesday in Jastrzebie in
Katowice Province, the country's industrial and mining heartland
and site of many of the mine strikes. Kiszczak also authorized
curfews in Szczecin and Gdansk provinces on the Baltic coast, but
none were declared.
   Four columns of army and police vehicles left Krakow on Tuesday
for Katowice, witnesses said. On the road in Oswiecim, near the
entrance to the coal-rich Silesia region, army roadblocks stopped
cars and searched them.

<HEAD>Earthquake Death Toll Rises As Rescue Teams Reach Remote Areas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from the Himalayan
earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by
monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote
areas of Nepal and found more bodies.
   In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks
were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and
officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million
people.
   ``It may be the second coming. All the rivers are in full spate,
and if the embankments breach, we are in for serious problems,''
said Puranman Mittal, the relief commissioner in Bihar state, which
suffered the most damage in India.
   Bihar residents ran screaming through the streets on Wednesday
when a mild tremor rumbled through the area. No casualties or
damage was reported, witnesses and the Seismological Observatory in
New Delhi said.
   Residents in Dharan, the worst-hit area of Nepal, also raced
from their homes Wednesday during two aftershocks, officials in
Katmandu said. No further damage was reported in the city, where
100 houses collapsed during the quake.
   Rescue workers demolished 50 homes in Dharan on Wednesday that
were severely damaged in the temblor, police inspector G. Adhikari
said.
   ``We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied
(the ones remaining) are to safe to live in,'' he said.
   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Prime Minister
Marich Man Singh Shrestha, said Tuesday after a tour of devastated
areas in his nation.
   At least 758 people died and 950 were injured in both countries
Sunday when the earthquake jolted the mountainous India-Nepal
border region.
   It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since
1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the
eastern Indian state of Assam.
   Indian officials said Wednesday that at least 196 died in India
in Sunday's disaster. Officials in Nepal said at least 562 people
were killed in Nepal, including 31 people whose bodies were found
in remote areas on Wednesday.
   In India's Bihar state, officials said the water had reached
dangerous levels and was still rising in six rivers: the Ganges,
the Ghagara, the Burigandak, the Bagmati, the Koshi and the
Mahananada.
   To make matters worse, survey teams found cracks in the
embankments of the six rivers, which are swollen by monsoon rains
that began in late June.
   Engineers tried to strengthen the weakened embankments with
cement, and helicopters made aerial surveys watching for ruptures.
   As survivors in both countries began rebuilding homes damaged or
destroyed by the quake, medicine, food and financial aid began
arriving from abroad.
   Elroy J. Carlson, an official at the U.S. Embassy in Katmandu,
said the United State offered $25,000 in aid. In New Delhi, U.S.
Ambassador John Gunther Dean presented the government with a
similar amount for Indian victims.
   Michael Hamilton, an official at the British Embassy in
Katmandu, said three medical teams had been sent to Dharan. ``The
teams are carrying two truckloads of blood and medicine,'' Hamilton
said.
   The British army also runs a military hospital in Dharan, where
at least 100 people were admitted. The government hospital in
Dharan treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood
houses collapsed.
   U.N. agencies and the Red Cross also sent medical teams to
Nepal, and the government began distributing 90-pound bags of rice.
   The relief efforts were hampered in both countries by heavy
rains which cut off communications and road links to several of the
affected areas.
   ``The earthquake hit a wide area, and it is a big job to reach
the remote villages. But we are trying,'' said Mittal, the relief
official in Bihar state.

<HEAD>County Prosecutor Won't Charge Cyanide-Capsule Killer With Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stella Nickell, convicted in federal court of
using cyanide-laced pills to kill her husband and a stranger, will
not face state murder charges, prosecutors said.
   Mrs. Nickell was convicted of product tampering in U.S. District
Court last May, and was sentenced to 90 years in prison.
   Dan Donohoe, spokesman for King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng's
office, said Tuesday that Maleng determined that ``substantial
justice was already done'' in the federal court sentence.
   ``The sentence is probably as much as she would have gotten for
a state murder conviction,'' Donohoe said.
   He also said Maleng thoroughly checked the case and noted a U.S.
Justice Department opinion stated the conviction would withstand
appeal.
   Maleng also said that, if necessary, he could impose a murder
charge at a later date since there is no statute of limitations.
   The charges against Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn, stemmed from
the June 1986 deaths of her husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Sue
Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn. Both died after taking
cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules.
   Besides putting tainted pills in a bottle of capsules used by
her husband, Mrs. Nickell was accused of placing poison pills in
capsule containers on store shelves to make her husband's death
appear to be at the hands of a random killer.
   She stood to gain about $100,000 more in life insurance policies
if her husband died by other than natural causes.
   The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and caused
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myer to recall the brand.

<HEAD>Greek, Turkish Cyriot Leaders To Meet On Island Reunification</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders agreed Wednesday
to meet next month for unconditional talks aimed at reunifying
their war-divided island.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar held a working
lunch for Greek Cypriot leader George Vassiliou and Rauf Denktash
of the Turkish Cypriot side in which he said the two men pledged
``a determined and sustained effort'' to resolve issues that have
long divided Cyprus.
   Vassiliou and Denktash said the meeting ``created a new
opportunity for finding a just and lasting solution of the Cyprus
problem,'' the U.N. leader told reporters.
   ``It was a good beginning, we made progress on the procedural
issues,'' said Vassiliou, recently elected president of the
internationally recognized Cyprus government.
   It was Vassiliou's first meeting with Denktash, president of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the Turkish-occupied
part of the island, which is only recognized internationally by
Turkey.
   Denktash also seemed satisfied by the meeting, saying Vassiliou
was ``a good talker and negotiator.''
   The Cyprus problem arose first in the wake of intercommunal
clashes in 1963 that led to the dispatch of a United Nations peace
force to the island. It was aggravated in July 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied 37 percent of the island in the wake of a coup
by supporters of union with Greece.
   Denktash's unilateral declaration of independence in November
1983 was declared legally invalid by the U.N. Security Council,
which demanded its abrogation.
   Previous negotiations between Denktash and former Cypriot
President Spyros Kyprianou broke down in December 1985.
   Kyprianou had insisted the negotiations follow the
implementation of United Nations resolutions demanding the
withdrawal of the estimated 30,000 Turkish troops from north Cyprus.
   ``I believe we will be able to find ways of settling the various
problems. He is different from Kyprianou,'' Denktash said.
   Denktash, however, indicated the question of troop withdrawal
was likely to be the biggest stumbling block.
   Denktash on Wednesday reiterated his position that there can be
no withdrawal ``before the dissolution of the illegal Cyprus
government,'' and its replacement by a joint Greek-Turkish Cypriot
administration.
   A senior U.N. official close to the negotiations said the
meeting ``went better than we expected and the two leaders got
along very well indeed.''
   ``We are sure they have already laid the foundations of fruitful
future negotiations,'' the official added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Perez de Cuellar said negotiations between the two Cypriot sides
will start Sept. 15 in Nicosia. The venue will be a hotel in the
UN-patrolled no-man's-land splitting the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sectors of the city for 25 years.
   He added that the two leaders will meet again Sept. 16 and
``recognized that the success of these talks depended on their
personal and continuous involvement.''
   The two also agreed to meet with Perez de Cuellar in New York
``after the first rounds of meetings in Nicosia to review the
progress achieved during this initial stage,'' he added.
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot sources revealed that the Nicosia
talks would be carried out on an intensive daily basis and that the
New York meeting would be held at the end of October.
   Perez de Cuellar said the two leaders also had reaffirmed their
committment to agreements reached between 1977 and 1984 for the
settlement of the Cyprus problem through the establishment of a
bizonal federation.
   The other major outstanding issues involve the implementation of
a series of U.N. resolutions ignored by Turkey.
   These demand the repatriation of 50,000 mainland settlers from
north Cyprus and the return of 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees,
one-third of the island population, to their homes there.
   The two sides, however, disagree on constitutional aspects and
the powers of the central government.

<TEXT>
   The head of Japan's Defense Agency resigned
Wednesday to take responsibility for a submarine collision that
killed 30 people aboard a sports fishing boat last month.
   Tsutomu Kawara, fighting back tears, urged his successor to take
steps to restore public confidence in the Self-Defense Forces after
a series of accidents.
   ``Many innocent lives were lost in an extremely regrettable
accident ... in which the defense force was one of the parties
involved,'' Kawara told reporters after handing in his resignation
to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Kawara, 51, who served as director-general for 10 months, said
his successor, Kichiro Tazawa, should ``take over the
responsibility of ensuring that such an accident never occurs
again.''
   Tazawa, installed as agency head Wednesday night, said in a
televised news conference that pursuing a safer armed forces would
be his major goal.
   The fishing boat, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, was rammed in the
side by the massive Nadashio naval submarine on July 23. Japanese
were outraged when television reports and witnesses' accounts
revealed crew members standing on the submarine and watching people
drown.
   ``While defense has grown ... increasingly important for our
country, there have been a large number of incidents involving the
Defense Agency,'' Kawara said.
   The submarine crash brings the number of military accidents this
year to 11 and the death toll to 32. Critics say public confidence
in the military is waning in a country where the armed forces have
rarely been popular.
   Kawara becomes the first Defense Agency director-general in 17
years to relinquish his post in a controversy involving to the
armed forces.
   In 1971, Keikichi Matsuhara resigned to take responsibility for
the deaths of 162 people when a military plane collided with a
commercial domestic airliner in northern Japan.
   It is customary for high-ranking business executives or
government officials to assume responsibility for a major incident
and resign as a means of restoring public confidence in the
institution they represent.
   Two other defense agency officials _ Defense Agency deputy head
Seiki Nishihiro and Adm. Shuichiro Higashiyama, chief of staff of
the Maritime Self-Defense Forces _ also indicated they would resign
after the submarine collision, but Kawara reportedly refused to
allow them to step down.
   Takeshita attended a memorial service Wednesday in Tokyo for the
30 victims of the submarine collision and reaffirmed that the
government would take steps to prevent accidents and provide
compensation for the victims' families.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Pollution Threatens 76-year-Old, Lakefront Gun Club</HEAD>

   Gun enthusiasts who have been shooting clay
targets along Chicago's lakefront for generations are under fire
from the parks agency and citizens groups who say the 76-year-old
club is polluting Lake Michigan.
   Patrons of the Lincoln Park Gun Club situated two miles from
downtown argue that it is a unique part of the lakefront's heritage
and one of few places in the city where people from all walks of
life can compete on equal ground.
   But the Park District and others complain of lead shot, clay
targets and plastic wads from shotgun shells.
   A Park District committee takes up the issue tonight, said Nancy
L. Kaszak, an attorney for the agency.
   The skeet and trap shooting club was founded in 1912, when
patrons showed up in straw hats and three-piece suits. Now, they
wear everything from hunting clothes to shorts.
   Membership costs $220 per year, and members can shoot for $3 per
round while non-members must pay $6.
   The club on city-owned land pays upkeep but no rent, said club
manager Ed Bishop. It has 386 members but more than 5,000 people
come to shoot every year.
   ``It's an integral part of the lakefront and an example of the
diversity of this city,'' said John Madonia, a 41-year-old health
care executive who came to the gun club with his father more than
20 years ago.
   ``It doesn't make any difference how much money you make _ if
you don't hit the target, it doesn't break,'' added John Mickey,
club vice president.
   Club officials acknowledge that the plastic wads cause litter
but said the organization is willing to hire people to pick up them
up. They also said the lead shot, wads and clay targets do not
pollute the water.
   ``It's more a litter problem than a pollution problem,'' Bishop
said.
   ``The gun club says it's litter, but we say it's water
pollution,'' argued Theodore Denning, manager of the Chicago field
office of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's division
of water pollution.
   Denning said that the clay and shot do not appear to threaten
marine life but that state law requires Illinois waters be free of
debris.
   Opponents of the club also say it is a safety hazard. ``We have
concerns about the operation and usage of guns in such a highly
dense park facility,'' Ms. Kaszak said.
   Bishop said the club's record speaks for itself. ``We've been
here 76 years and we've never have an accident,'' he said. ``You're
safer here than you are in a golf course.''

   The Newspaper Guild on Wednesday qualified its
backing of Democrat Michael Dukakis' presidential candidacy,
declaring a 15 percent abstention primarily because of opposition
by wire service employees to any political endorsements.
   Three of the AFL-CIO's 90 other affiliated unions _ the Air Line
Pilots Association, the Teamsters and the Marine Engineers _ voted
to abstain their entire memberships in the labor federation's
formal endorsement of Dukakis.
   The Marine Engineers for three decades have opposed making a
presidential endorsement and the Air Line Pilots said they had not
had a meeting of their executive board on making an endorsement.
   Teamster President William McCarthy, whose union endorsed Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and 1984, said he was abstaining on a presidential
endorsement until after a mail poll of his union's members is
completed in mid-September.
   Newspaper Guild President Charles Dale said his union's
executive board and convention in June ``gave its blessing'' to a
presidential endorsement.
   But primarily because of uproars in the past from its
1,000-member Wire Service Guild local, he told the AFL-CIO's
general board that he was casting only 21,390 votes for a Dukakis
endorsement and voting his union's 4,000 other members as
abstaining.
   ``At least one of our locals _ the Wire Service Guild,
representing employees of Associated Press and United Press
International _ has a policy of dissassociating itself from any
political endorsements by this international,'' he said. ``So I
note that our vote does not carry with it the support of members of
that local.''
   In 1983, The Newspaper Guild had cast all of its members' votes
in favor of the AFL-CIO's early endorsement of Walter Mondale.
   The following week the Wire Service Guild formally dissociated
itself from that endorsement, saying that because it represents
reporters who cover political campaigns, it should refrain from
taking sides in them.
   The local based its action on a membership referendum conducted
in 1973 following the parent union's presidential campaign
endorsement a year earlier of Democrat George McGovern.

<HEAD>Bentsen Suggests Quayle Too Immature For High Office</HEAD>

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen suggested Wednesday that his Republican counterpart,
Dan Quayle, lacks the maturity required of someone who might have
to lead the country.
   ``I don't think America can risk youthful indiscretion in
someone who could become our president at any moment,'' Bentsen,
67, told the Southern Legislative Conference in Lexington, in his
toughest attack on the 41-year-old Quayle.
   The Texas senator referred to a speech that Quayle made earlier
this week before the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Chicago, where
Quayle blamed ``youthful indiscretion'' for his opposition to
Senate legislation that would establish a Cabinet-level Department
of Veteran Affairs.
   The Indiana senator told the VFW he was reversing that position.
Bentsen said that was an example of how Quayle would behave if he
were in the White House.
   ``A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only
five weeks ago,'' Bentsen said. ``I don't think America can risk
youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at
any moment.''
   At a news conference after his speech, Bentsen made a veiled
reference to Quayle's decision to seek entry into the National
Guard in 1969 during the Vietnam War. Bentsen, whose son joined the
Guard one year earlier, has refused to attack Quayle directly on
that issue.
   Asked about Quayle, Bentsen, a former World War II bomber pilot,
said:
   ``I certainly don't think he's too young. But I think that you
have to have some maturity.
   ``And I think that the breadth of experience that I've had, and
the tests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened to
me early on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast.''
   Quayle's quick switch on the VA bill showed that he didn't have
``the continuity of judgment that you would expect,'' said Bentsen,
who supported the veterans bill which the Senate approved July 12.
   Bentsen said he was ``not stepping up criticisms of his
(Quayle's) personal life,'' and he made no mention of allegations
involving Quayle's association with former lobbyist Paula Parkinson
during a Florida golfing weekend in 1980.
   But Bentsen said he was ``just getting started'' comparing his
record and experience with Quayle's.
   Asked if he thought Quayle would still be on the GOP ticket in
November, Bentsen replied: ``I hope so.''
   Quayle received a warm reception from the Southern legislators,
many of them pro-Reagan Democrats, not long after Bentsen addressed
them. The two candidates met briefly at the Lexington airport,
where Bentsen said he had just ``warmed up the crowd'' for Quayle.
The two shook hands and laughed.
   In his speech, Bentsen criticized Republican nominee George
Bush's assertion that he would create 30 million new jobs in eight
years. Bentsen said there were only 6.5 million people looking for
work.
   ``The only way you'd get 30 million jobs is to take away the
border patrol and move one-third of Mexico here,'' he said. ``Or
raise the working age to 80.''
   Bush's statement was another example of ``voodoo economics,''
Bentsen said.
   ``There is no real alternative to the honest, able leadership of
Mike Dukakis,'' Bentsen said. ``Mike Dukakis is right for the South
_ take it from a Texan.''
   From Lexington, Bentsen flew to Louisville and visited a senior
citizens home. The Senate Finance Committee chairman talked about
his efforts toward enacting a catastrophic health insurance law.
   He told about 300 residents of Dosker Manor that despite their
talk of helping the elderly, the Republicans had tried to cut back
programs for seniors.
   ``Don't just read their lips, see what they do,'' he said,
twisting a phrase that Bush used had used in his acceptance speech
at the GOP National Convention in New Orleans about opposing tax
increases.

   The captain of the USS Dubuque is refusing to
appear at a Navy disciplinary hearing on charges of dereliction of
duty for failing to rescue a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who
claim they later resorted to cannibalism to survive, the service
says.
   Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48, of Los Angeles has been charged
with two counts of violating lawful orders under a section of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice that calls for ``non-judicial
punishment proceedings,'' said Cmdr. David Dillon, a Pacific Fleet
spokesman in San Diego, Calif.
   He was ordered to appear at a closed ``admiral's mast'' this
afternoon before Vice Adm. George W. Davis Jr., the head of all
surface ships in the Pacific Fleet, the spokesman added. At such a
hearing, Balian could be stripped permanently of his command, fined
or issued a letter of reprimand or censure.
   But Balian notified the Navy on Tuesday afternoon that he was
exercising his right to refuse the admiral's mast, said Captain
Peter Litrenta, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   ``This won't be dropped,'' a source said. ``If he doesn't show
up for the mast tomorrow, then there's going to be a court
martial.''
   Balian was charged with violating a general Navy regulation ``by
wrongfully failing to render appropriate assistance to Vietnamese
refugees found on the South China Sea on June 9, 1988, in danger of
being lost.''
   The second count accuses him of violating standing operational
orders for the Pacific Fleet ``which require a commanding officer
to aid and rescue refugees encountered at sea in life-endangering
circumstances.''
   The Navy also alleges Balian ``was derelict in the performance
of those duties in that he negligently failed to investigate
sufficiently and render appropriate assistance ... as it was his
duty to do.''
   In an admiral's mast, Davis would serve as the lone judge or
authority in considering the evidence.
   Given Balian's decision not to attend, Davis will have to decide
whether to drop the matter or order an Article 32 hearing. An
Article 32 hearing, similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding, is
the first step in a full military court martial.
   According to the Navy, Balian could receive a maximum penalty of
two years in prison and total forfeiture of pay if the case went to
court-martial and he was convicted.
   Balian was relieved temporarily of his command of the Dubuque on
Aug. 13 pending the outcome of a Navy investigation.
   The Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship, encountered the
boatload of Vietnamese refugees while steaming to duty in the
Persian Gulf. The Navy said the Dubuque gave the refugees several
hundred pounds of food and water and navigational aids but did not
take them aboard because ``the refugee craft was judged seaworthy''
by Balian.
   Navy regulations and orders specify that warships should ``be
alert for refugees on the high seas'' and ``if encountered, ships
are to extend humanitarian assistance as needed.''
   ``In the case of an unseaworthy vessel, adverse weather or other
special circumstances, the refugees may be embarked and transported
to the Navy ship's next port of call.''
   The boat people eventually were rescued off the coast of the
Philippines and taken to a refugee camp there, where reports of
murder and cannibalism began to surface.
   Some survivors have been quoted as saying they ate fellow
passengers to stay alive after they encountered the Dubuque. Two
victims reportedly died of starvation, but three others allegedly
were murdered through drowning and then eaten.
   Some survivors charged the Dubuque refused to take them aboard
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure
and starvation.
   In addition to the Navy, the United Nations High Commission on
Refugees has been investigating those reports.
   Robert Cooper, the U.N. commission's Manila representative, said
52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 58 people died during the
crossing. The refugees began their journey May 22 from the Mekong
Delta town of Ben Tre aboard a 35-foot wooden boat. Its engine
failed two or three days later.

   The man whose book ``The Graduate''
became the smash-hit movie of an idealistic generation says he is
nearly destitute, living out of a van and trying to make ends meet
on a few thousand dollars a year.
   ``It's hard to make anybody believe the author of `The Graduate'
needs money,'' said Charles Webb, 49, who says his abhorrence of
materialism led him to give away two houses in his salad days.
   Hard times, however, have driven Webb and his ex-wife, an artist
who calls herself Fred, out of the California campground where they
lived for the last decade to the Massachusetts town where Webb went
to college 30 years ago.
   He came East, he said Wednesday, in hopes of finding a publisher
for his latest project, a compilation of writings on prejudice. His
plight, however, has taken him to a welfare office in North Adams,
which rejected him because he has no permanent address.
   ``The things he stands for and believes in are principles he
can't live by any longer,'' said Fred, 48, who still lives with her
ex-husband.
   The novelist, whose hero in ``The Graduate,'' Benjamin Braddock,
struck a chord among young readers with his post-graduate misery at
his parents' suburban home, has lived until now according to what
friends consider impossibly high and even self-destructive
standards.
   ``If he's hard up for dough, it's obviously due to ... his
inclination toward divestiture,'' said Eric Davis, a college
classmate who teaches at the private Commonwealth School in Boston.
   Webb said he gave a Hollywood house to a real estate agent in
the 1960s and another home to the Massachusetts Audubon Society in
1970, because he felt the need for ``getting free of things.''
   Getting free also explains his and Fred's decision eight years
ago to get a divorce although they had no intention of separating.
Fred said the couple felt marriage violated their constitutional
freedoms.
   The couple were married in 1962, the year ``The Graduate'' was
published and a year after his graduation from Williams College.
Webb, son of a California doctor, epoused odd views even back in
college, Davis said.
   ``We always used to wonder whether Chuck was putting us on,''
Davis said. ``He's quite sophisticated, a very intelligent person
with a real heart, but he always said things that sounded
peculiarly simple.''
   Webb says he received only $20,000 for the film rights to ``The
Graduate,'' which made a star of Dustin Hoffman when it came out in
1967. The novel, however, is still in print and continues to earn
him a few thousand dollars in royalties annually.
   ``The Graduate'' was followed by four other novels, including
``The Marriage of A Young Stockbroker,'' which also was made into a
movie. His last work, ``Booze,'' was published in 1978.
   That year, Webb took his two sons, then in the sixth and ninth
grades, out of school and went ``underground'' because of his fear
that schools were harming their minds.
   After a year in France, the Webbs moved to Ventura County in
California, where they remained, living in their van, until they
returned to Massachusetts a few months ago.
   Webb said he stopped writing during that time, reluctantly
accepting support from his mother, to raise his sons and
concentrate on larger issues, such as prejudice.
   ``I came to feel that writing fiction was a more narrow concern
than addressing problems that went beyond my narrow,
career-oriented goals,'' he said.
   Both sons are now in graduate school, one studying Russian and
the other art. ``I hope that's an indication they are going to be a
little more stable than their parents,'' Webb said.
   But he added that he doesn't regret the unusual life that led to
his present situation. ``It's hard to think there would be another
way to do it.''

   Security forces armed with machine
guns prevented sectarian violence Wednesday as thousands of Shiites
marched through Pakistani cities and beat themselves to observe a
major Moslem holy day.
   The marches came one week after the death of President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, a Sunni Moslem whose policies drew criticism from
hard-line Shiites. The cause of the plane crash that killed Zia is
not known, but sabotage is suspected.
   Sectarian friction between Shiite Moslems, a small minority, and
the majority Sunni Moslems typically increases on Ashura, which
marks the death almost 1,400 years ago of the prophet Mohammed's
grandson, Imam Hussain.
   About 30 people have died this year in Sunni-Shiite gun battles
in northern Pakistan, according to news reports. Tension rose in
early August after the assassination by unidentified gunmen of
Pakistani Shiite leader Arif Hussain al-Hussaini in the northwest
frontier city of Peshawar.
   New clashes were reported in the region after Zia died Aug. 17
in a plane crash that also killed U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and
28 others.
   The Shiite procession in Peshawar and other major cities went
off without incident and disbanded before dusk Wednesday.
   During the processions fervent Shiites beat their chests and
flogged their backs with switches of razor-sharp metal to show
devotion to the martyr.
   In the southern port of Karachi, the country's largest city, up
to 40,000 Shiites marched through the main district in observance
of the Ashura holiday, but no violent incidents were reported.
   About 20,000 police, paramilitary units and army regulars
dressed in full battle gear lined Karachi's streets along the
procession. They drove vehicles mounted with machine guns and kept
watch from rooftops on the seven-mile route.
   In Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, another procession of
40,000 people peacefully made its way along tightly guarded city
streets.
   Authorities imposed curfew-like conditions along the route, with
residents ordered to stay indoors and not look out their windows, a
witness said.
   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and other government leaders
had made pleas for sectarian harmony on the eve of Ashura.
   Pakistan officials say they believe Zia's death was a result of
sabotage but have not said who they think is responsible. Some
officials have hinted at agents of neighboring Afghanistan's
pro-Soviet government. An investigation by American and Pakistani
officials is being conducted.
   Zia, a Sunni, instituted Moslem law in Pakistan, but hard-line
Shiites claimed the program did not take into account their form of
jurisprudence. Pakistan's Shiites also disapproved of Zia's close
ties to the United States, which has has long had icy relations
with Shiite-led Iran.
   A flurry of political activity has followed Zia's death as
political leaders prepare for crucial nationwide elections
scheduled for November.
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Tuesday called on Ishaq Khan
to dismiss the Cabinet and appoint a caretaker government until
elections. Thirteen of the 16 Cabinet ministers were appointed by
Zia.
   Ms. Bhutto leads the country's largest opposition party, the
Pakistan People's Party, and has expressed confidence that if
elections were conducted fairly, her group would win. She has
demanded the government rescind Zia's order that all candidates run
unaffiliated with a party.
   In 1977, a coup led by Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Two years later, Zia had the former
official executed.

   When the parents of 12-year-old Sarah
Caldwell buried their strangled daughter, their 10-year-old son was
close to dying from stab wounds.
   The next evening, when the children's often-distraught father
disappeared, the family feared J. Robert Caldwell might harm
himself and police issued an all-points bulletin.
   Then, several days later, the 41-year-old Caldwell was arrested
at the apartment of a co-worker and charged with attempted murder
in the Aug. 16 attack on his son.
   Prosecutors said laboratory results will determine whether the
father may also be charged with the murder of Sarah, who was
strangled and raped.
   Caldwell appeared in court Wednesday and asked for a
court-appointed lawyer. No bail was set.
   The day after Sarah's burial and again Tuesday, police talked to
her younger brother, Ben, about the attacks that occurred after
Mrs. Caldwell left the family's home. She found the children when
she returned home.
   Ben Caldwell, who lost four pints of blood and was found
face-down in a bathtub, wasn't told of his sister's death until a
week after the attacks.
   The boy had been stabbed repeatedly in the back, apparently with
scissors.
   Cobb County District Attorney Tom Charron said the warrants for
Caldwell were based on interviews with the boy and other evidence,
but he would not reveal what the boy told investigators.
   ``There is a lot of evidence and no inconsistencies,'' he said
at a news conference Tuesday night.
   Family members described Caldwell as prone to leaving home.
   ``He was a good father. He just had this problem of skipping
whenever the pressures got tough,'' said Lill Anderton, Caldwell's
mother-in-law.
   ``There's a lot of unanswered questions, ... an awful lot,''
said father-in-law B.L. Anderton. ``And I don't know if I want to
know the answers.''
   Caldwell's mother, Bertha Padgett, said it was common for her
son to vanish for six or seven months at a time.
   Family members said Caldwell left his wife shortly after Ben was
born and didn't return for years. Although the couple had been
divorced, they had lived together since 1986, the family members
said.
   Mrs. Padgett said Caldwell dropped out of high school to join
the Navy, was rebuffed because of his age but joined a year later
and eventually returned to Georgia to marry a woman 10 years his
senior. She died of pneumonia.
   Caldwell served time in jail on abandonment charges after his
first wife swore out a warrant against him, his mother said.

<HEAD>Strike at Key Mine in Hungary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 300 workers went on strike at
a key mine in southern Hungary on Wednesday, demanding restoration
of cuts in bonuses and changes in a new income tax, state radio
said.
   The strike at the Mecsek mine near Pecs marked the first known
worker protest against the stringent economic policies of Karoly
Grosz since he became Communist Party leader in May.
   State radio said agreement was reached to restore the cut
bonuses and that some strikers resumed work. Other strikers, said
to include more than 300 miners and an unspecified number of office
workers, would wait until Thursday, it was reported.
   The radio reported the strikers threatened to stop work again if
parliament does not vote to iron out a quirk in a new tax law that
gives some workers on sick benefit more net income than those
working normally.
   The strike coincided with labor unrest in Poland, but appeared
unconnected.
   Reports of strikes have been extremely rare in communist
Hungary, although there were scattered reports of labor unrest in
1969, 1977 and 1980-81.
   Wednesday's relatively swift reporting of the miners' stoppage
appeared to reflect the greater openness of state-run media under
Grosz.
   The state news agency MTI said the stoppage began Tuesday night,
when 150 miners refused to start the evening shift at the Istvan
pithead in the Mecsek colliery at Komlo, 10 miles north of Pecs
near the Yugoslav border.
   The day shift of 150 miners also refused to go into the pit head
and the stoppage spread to ``several other sections,'' state radio
said.
   The state news agency MTI called the stoppage ``a pure
industrial dispute with no political undertones.''
   Komlo is Hungary's only mine producing high-grade black coking
coal for the Danubian iron works, one of the nation's three main
iron and steel mills.
   MTI said one grievance of the striking miners was computation of
personal income tax introduced Jan. 1 as part of Grosz's efforts to
curb Hungary's $18 billion gross foreign debt and to stimulate the
economy.
   Hungary's official trade unions have criticized the policies,
saying workers, pensioners and the unemployed must be protected
against inflation, already running at 18 percent this year.
   Miners are among the most militant workers in Hungary.
   The official trade union organization SZOT protested Wednesday
against a provision in the new tax system that means workers on
sick leave can end up with more net income than those who work
regularly.
   Government spokesman Gyorgy Marosan said without elaborating
that this was an anomaly the government soon would fix.
   The miners' other main complaint was that the new tax system has
sliced annual bonuses by 30 percent to 50 percent, radio said.
   Gyula Zipper, deputy industry minister, told state radio it
would be up to parliament to decide whether to change the tax law,
but that companies should make up bonuses to last year's levels.
Banks should give credits for this to companies posting a deficit,
Zipper said.
   This appeared to weaken recent government statements that
enterprises would have to turn a profit or face closure as a result
of reduced state subsidies.

<HEAD>D.C. Officials Unveil Plan to Upgrade School System.</HEAD>

   A new effort to improve the capital's
beleaguered public schools will give principals broader power and
eliminate some of their bosses, officials announced Wednesday.
   ``We've been a top-down organization, and we want to put more
authority and responsibility where the action is,'' school
superintendent Andrew Jenkins said. ``We are going to make the
local school principal more responsible.''
   Special and bilingual education programs also will receive more
attention, the superintendent said.
   Jenkins was appointed head of the city's schools in May under a
contract that required him to overhaul the school system. He
pledged Wednesday that the new plan would be put into effect by
February, 1989.
   Various national surveys have ranked the capital's public
schools near the bottom of the list for urban areas. One study, by
Charles Harrison, former director of the Education Writers
Association, gave the district's 88,000-student school system a
grade of 17 out of a possible 100 after comparing attendance rates,
average SAT scores, teacher-student ratios, dropout rates and the
number of college-level courses offered in 52 metropolitan school
systems.
   Only Oakland and Hillsborough County schools near Tampa, Fla.,
rated lower than the capital's school system.
   Jenkins had no cost projections for the new program, but
promised the school system would stay within its $623 million
budget for fiscal year 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   One major change is that the position of ``regions'' _
adminstrators responsible for overseeing several schools at once _
will be eliminated. Instead, the principals of each school will
report directly to Jenkins or a yet-to-be-appointed vice
superintendent.
   ``After awhile, all bureaucracies become out of sync,'' Jenkins
said. ``They need to be put back together.''
   Although he provided no specific figures, Jenkins said other
less visible administrative positions would be eliminated. Those
employees will be reassigned within the system instead of being
dismissed, Jenkins said.
   ``At the end of the school year, I expect to see tangible
progress'' in standardized achievement scores,'' the superintendent
said.

   Nearly 300 people accused of belonging
to an outlawed Marxist terrorist group were convicted Wednesday by
a military court following a six-year trial, a news agency said.
   Eight of the defendants were sentenced to death, 14 received
life in prison and another 270 received jail terms ranging from one
year to 20 years, according to the independent Huriyet News Agency.
The court acquitted another 434 people.
   All of the defendants were charged with belonging to the violent
and outlawed Marxist group Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Path). The group
was responsible for plotting a coup in the 1970s from the Black Sea
Coastal town of Fatsa, Turkey's first Marxist community.
   Charges against the defendants included 103 political killings,
36 murder attempts, kidnappings, bombings and armed robberies. The
agency gave no breakdown of the convictions.
   The alleged leader of the group, Fikri Sonmez, a tailor and
elected mayor of Fatsa, died of a heart attack in jail two years
ago.
   Violence involving leftist and rightist extremists and security
forces claimed at least 5,000 people from 1978 to 1980.

   Michael G. Metkin won a heated competition
this week when a furnace stored in his garage was dubbed the oldest
of its kind in the city.
   The 64-year-old Metkin, a tool and die maker, was one of 200
people who responded to a contest to find the oldest Atlas furnace.
   His round coal-burning furnace was built in 1925 by Atlas
Heating and Ventilating, a San Francisco company that later became
the biggest builder of gas furnaces in the United States, said Bob
Tuck, the company's retired president.
   Atlas, which invented the first gas blower furnance and gas
safety pilot light, was at its height from the mid-1930s to World
War II. It sponsored a contest to find the oldest of its products
as a way of celebrating its 80th anniversary.
   ``That may be junk to others, but it's treasure to me because it
played an important part of life here,'' said city archivist Gladys
Hansen, who hopes to take the door from the furnace and put it on
display in the local history room of the public library.
   Metkin said the furnace was never converted to gas and has sat
unused in his garage. ``Even though I never used it, something told
me to save it,'' Metkin said.
   For winning the contest, Metkin gets a new $3,000 heating system.

   The board reviewed a list of 25 slogans culled from more than
7,500 entries. Ideas poured in after an advertising campaign
sponsored by the commission and the Long Island Rail Road.
   The winning slogan is expected to be announced next week. The

   The persistent controversy surrounding Dan
Quayle is worrying some Southern Republican state legislators who
said Wednesday they fear it is diverting attention from GOP nominee
George Bush's message to the voters.
   Quayle, the Republican vice presidential candidate, received a
warm welcome from the Southern Legislative Conference for a brief
speech that followed an address by his Democratic counterpart, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Afterward, several GOP legislators said in interviews that the
attention focused on Quayle's service in the Indiana National Guard
during the Vietnam War and other issues is hurting the national
Republican ticket.
   ``I think anytime you spend a lot of time about an ancillary
issue ... obviously it's divisive,'' said Louisiana state Sen. John
Hainkel of New Orleans.
   ``It hasn't been good because it's taken the spotlight off the
things we ought to be talking about,'' Hainkel said.
   State Rep. Bill Strong of Hazard, Ky., agreed.
   ``It's kind of stymied the ticket,'' Strong said.``It's
dominated the news where Bush can't get his message across.''
   State Sen. Jim Tysinger of DeKalb County, Ga., said that both
Bush and the Democratic ticket led by Michael Dukakis have suffered
from all the attention paid to Quayle.
   ``It has hurt both of them,'' Tysinger said. ``Dukakis hasn't
been in the news, and neither has Bush.''
   Other GOP legislators saw some benefits flowing from the Quayle
controversy.
   ``It has added to the party, and I want to thank the press,''
said West Virginia Del. Robert Jones of Martinsville. ``It's
inviting more questions, and I think the exposure's good.''
   ``I think it's brought more focus to the ticket,'' said state
Del. Martha Klima of Lutherville, Md. ``You don't hear anything
about Dukakis and Bentsen anymore.''
   No Republican interviewed Wednesday said Quayle's problems are
serious enough to warrant his removal from the GOP ticket.
   ``If I was George Bush, I wouldn't even consider that,'' Hainkel
said. ``You'd infuriate every man who ever served in the National
Guard, for one thing.''
   Many lawmakers thought the news media would suffer a backlash if
they kept alive questions about Quayle's National Guard service.
Most said enough had been written and uttered about the subject.
   ``It's detracted from what the American people need to know,''
said state Rep. Edward H. Moody of Morristown, Tenn.

   Israeli troops ambushed and killed five
guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group in southern Lebanon
on Wednesday, the army command said. Six of the soldiers were
wounded.
   Guerrilla and Israel artillery batteries exchanged fire after
the battle, and the attacking soldiers moved back behind their
lines, Israel television reported.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is an umbrella group for Shiite
Moslem extremists believed to be holding American hostages in
Lebanon.
   The clash was near the village of Kaoukaba, north of Israel's
security zone in southern Lebanon. Israel established the six- to
10-mile zone after withdrawing most of its troops from southern
Lebanon in June 1985 following a three-year occupation.
   The zone is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli soldiers and more
than 1,000 South Lebanon Army militiamen trained and financed by
Israel.
   The army command said the Israeli force operated in Lebanese
territory on a search-and-destroy mission. All five guerrillas were
reported killed.
   The army command said five of the soldiers were treated on the
spot and a sixth was slightly wounded and hospitalized.
   Israeli troops last operated outside the security zone in May,
when they attacked two Hezbollah strongholds, killing more than 40
guerrillas. Three soldiers died in the attacks.
   Eighteen foreign hostages, including nine Americans, are missing
and believed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is American
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The physical abilities test for city
firefighters appears designed to ensure that women won't pass, said
the state Human Rights commissioner.
   ``It is not a test that finds the best possible firefighters,''
the commissioner, Stephen Cooper, said Tuesday. ``It's a test for
just a few qualities. It would be like if I was going to hire you
to be an over-the-road trucker and the only thing that I tested you
for was the ability to eat french fries.''
   Cooper said his investigators looked at firefighters'
examinations in several major U.S. cities. The result was a report
issued Tuesday in which an unidentified fire chief in another city
was quoted as saying, ``If you were going to design a test to
exclude women, you'd end up with the St. Paul test.''
   The report concluded there was probable cause that
discrimination against women took place, Cooper said.
   A complaint was filed after all 17 women who took the test in
May failed to pass. They had all passed a separate written exam.
   A judge temporarily halted the hiring of St. Paul firefighters
pending the investigation by the Human Rights Department.
   Cooper said the next step is to try to resolve the dispute
through an informal conciliation process with city officials. If
that is unsuccessful, he said, litigation is a last resort.
   Assistant City Attorney Terry Sullivan said neither he nor other
city officials would comment immediately. ``We'll respond in the
next several days as to what approach we're going to take,'' he
said.
   Cooper's report said the test was unfair to female applicants
and is discriminatory even in the absence of an intent to
discriminate.
   The city failed to meet its burden of showing that its
methodology is valid and that the extreme effect it has on women is
justified, he said.
   ``There is no evidence that a person's score on the physical
test is predictive of his-her future job performance as a
firefighter,'' Cooper said.
   Cooper said the timed test measured only sprinting ability and
upper body strength, areas in which men excel while ignoring
stamina, an area in which women can perform well. A ladder climb
and blindfold maze race, events in which women can often outrun
men, were not rated for speed but scored on a pass-fail basis.

   A bitter feud among lawmakers over
Syria's role in Lebanon has prevented the election of a new
Lebanese president and could rekindle the nation's 13-year war
between Moslems and Christians.
   Parliamentary deputies representing the 80 percent of Lebanon
controlled by Syria, the nation's main power broker, and its Moslem
militia allies want a president willing to crush Syria's main foe,
the right-wing Lebanese Forces.
   The Lebanese Forces _ the Christians' main militia which has
links to Israel _ is blocking re-election of former president
Suleiman Franjieh, a Christian branded by political rivals as
``Syria's candidate.''
   ``Should a constitutional vacuum develop, one can kiss Lebanon
goodbye,'' said Christian politician Shaker Abu Sleiman.
``Lebanon's fate is at stake,'' said parliamentary deputy Joseph
Skaff, also a Christian.
   Franjieh, 78, governed from 1970 to 1976. He is the front-runner
in a lackluster field of candidates that includes Dany Chamoun, son
of the late Camille Chamoun, another former president.
   Behind the friction lie old hatreds.
   Franjieh holds the Lebanese Forces leader, Samir Geagea,
responsible for killing his son Tony, Tony's wife and 3-year-old
daughter along with 30 others in a raid on the family's summer
mansion in June 1978.
   Geagea opposes Syria's strategy of seeking political reforms
that would give Moslems equal power with the Christians, who have
dominated the government, judiciary and army since independence
from France in 1943.
   Back then, the Christians were considered the majority.
   Now, Moslems comprise about 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million
people and Christians make up 45 percent.
   In July, just 38 of the 76 members of Parliament attended a
session to elect a new president, far short of the quorum needed.
   All but two of the deputies who turned up were Moslems. They
accused the Lebanese Forces of physically preventing Christian
deputies from attending. No date for a new session has been set.
   There have been no parliamentary elections in Lebanon since
1972. The 99-seat house has simply renewed its mandate every two
years.
   The Lebanese Forces pledged: ``There will be no quorum so long
as Franjieh is a candidate.'' But the Syrians declared they still
back Franjieh.
   ``Syria's staunch support for Franjieh against local, regional
and international powers is a very risky move that could plunge
Lebanon into all-out violence,'' said a foreign diplomat who
demanded anonymity.
   A Moslem politician, who asked not to be identified, said: ``If
the spirit of challenge persists, we might not have a president by
Sept. 23.''
   That's when the six-year term of the incumbent president,
Maronite Catholic Amin Gemayel, expires. Under constitutional
rules, Gemayel, 46, cannot run again for a consecutive second term.
   The politician noted: ``Franjieh, whether candidate or
president, means war. If elected, he'll launch war on the Lebanese
Forces, and if not elected, he'll launch war on them.''
   After more than a decade of war and the fragmentation of Lebanon
into a cluster of sectarian cantons, Gemayel's authority is limited
to his own stronghold in the Metn mountains.
   The Lebanese Forces control the rest of the shrunken Christian
enclave.
   Syria and its Moslem allies have boycotted Gemayel for 2{ years,
since he torpedoed a Syrian-brokered peace accord under which the
Christians would surrender some of their power.
   Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, a Sunni, went to
Damascus on Wednesday for talks with Syrian leaders on the
presidential deadlock, a senior government official said in Beirut.
``He will certainly discuss with the Syrian command what should be
done if a president is not elected by Sept. 23,'' the offcial
added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Despite their differences, most Lebanese factions believe a
constitutional vacuum will be disastrous.
   Under an unwritten national covenant, dating back to
independence, the president has to be a Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni Moslem and the House speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily said Gemayel would form an
interim government headed by a Maronite prime minister if a
president is not elected before Sept. 23. The 1943 covenant allows
a Maronite to be named prime minister if the presidential post is
vacant.
   But 10 Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions warned they
will prevent such a government from running the country.
   Besides Franjieh, a warlord whose private army controls north
Lebanon, none of the other half-dozen Christian contenders appears
to have much of a chance.

   Blacks and other racial minorities constitute
16 percent of the workforce of American newspapers, but only 8
percent of the news and editorial staffs, according to the American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   The ANPA survey, made public Wednesday, also said that 37
percent of the papers' employees are women.
   In the nation's overall workforce, minorities constitute 21
percent and women 47 percent of the total.
   The study suggested that the newsroom was the place in a
newspaper plant were minorities were least likely to be found. Ten
percent of newsroom employees were members of minorities, and, when
clerical and administrative workers were subtracted, the number
dropped to 8 percent, according to ANPA spokesman Joe Lorfano.
   That finding approximates the results of an annual survey
conducted by the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   In April, the 1988 ASNE survey found blacks, Hispanics,
Asian-Americans and American Indians constituted 7.02 percent of
newsroom employees, a slight increase from the 6.56 percent level
in 1987 but a sharp increase from the 3.95 percent in the survey's
first year, 1978.
   The ASNE survey was based on responses from 1,092 of the
approximately 1,645 daily newspapers published in the United States.
   In the ANPA study, responses came from 546 of the 1,443 daily
newspapers that were sent questionnaires.
   The study, conducted by Belden Associates of Dallas, was
undertaken to give the association ``a benchmark to measure the
effectiveness of our programs to assist individual newspapers in
their efforts to increase employment and promotion opportunities
for their employees,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman of the
ANPA and publisher of The New York Times.
   It was the first industrywide attempt to determine the racial
composition of all departments in newspapers.
   The survey said that minorities constitute 22 percent of the
employees in newspapers' general management _ including executive,
professional, technical, clerical and service workers. They were 19
percent of the production workers and 19 percent of circulation
workers; 17 percent of those in accounting, finance and information
services; 13 percent of those in advertising and 11 percent in
marketing, promotion and research.
   The ANPA said its Minority Opportunity Committee, chaired by Jay
Smith, publisher of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, is
considering establishing a computerized national employment program
to allow newspapers to list minoritiy job opportunities.

   Thousands of Nagorno-Karabakh residents rallied
around their legislative building Wednesday while the deputies
inside discussed grievances in the disputed region.
   The actions ended a month of relative quiet in Nagorno-Karabakh,
an enclave of mostly Christian Armenians located within the Soviet
republic of Azerbaijan, near the border with Turkey and Iran. From
February to July, the residents went on strikes and street protests
to demand that jurisdiction of their region be moved from
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan to the Soviet republic of Armenia.
   The campaign subsided in late July after the central leadership
rejected the demand.
   Wednesday's report of many thousands of people gathered outside
the Nagorno-Karabakh legislative building in Stepanakert came from
the state-run radio station in Yerevan, the Armenian capital. The
broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported ``an all-city meeting'' at
which the opinions of work collectives were expressed.
   The legislature appealed to Moscow to consider the opinions of
these work collectives and ``the wishes expressed by deputies''
about the administrative subordination of the region, Tass said.
This appeared to be a veiled reference to earlier demands for
Nagorno-Karabakh to be placed under the control of Armenia.
   A resident of Stepanakert said by telephone that people massed
Wednesday to renew the annexation demand. But the telephone
interview was cut off before the resident, a woman, could identify
herself. Other calls to Stepanakert and the Azerbaijani capital,
Baku, did not go through.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh legislature also approved a new plan to
improve the social and economic conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh by
1995, Tass said. So far, the program was being implemented
``unsatisfactorily,'' the legislature declared.
   The lawmakers also approved plans for strengthening the region's
economic ties with business enterprises in Armenia, and called for
closer cooperation with the republic in ``spiritual and cultural
life,'' Tass said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh was made part of Azerbaijan in 1923 although
more than three-quarters of its residents are ethnic Armenians.
They claim economic, cultural and religious discrimination under
Azerbaijani rule.
   The Presidium of the Communist Party's Central Committee in
Moscow on July 18 said Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of
Azerbaijan, but it set up a commission to consider changes in its
territorial status. The area is now classified as an autonomous
region of Azerbaijan.
   The Presidium sent a representative, Arkady I. Volsky, to
Nagorno-Karabakh to help local authorities improve living
conditions. Tass said without elaborating that he attended
Wednesday's session of the Soviet of People's Deputies.

   An Indiana National Guard official said
Wednesday that it took less time for an unemployed truck driver to
be sworn into the Guard than it did Dan Quayle, who has been
accused of using family influence to secure a spot with the Guard
and avoid the Vietnam War.
   It took retired Sgt. Stephen W. Morell three days to complete
processing and Quayle, the Indiana senator who is the Republican
vice presidential nominee, 11 days, Guard records show.
   Morell, who says he dropped out of college and walked into a
recruitment office, was offered a clerk-typist's position three
days after undergoing preliminary testing on May 19, 1969.
   Morell served side-by-side with the Quayle, who records show was
placed 11 days after he was tested May 8, 1969.
   ``We entered the Guard the same rank and left the Guard the same
rank. And I was a nobody,'' Morell told The Associated Press.
   Capt. Cathi Kiger said how quickly recruits pass through
preliminary processing, such as aptitude tests, interviews and
physical examinations, often depends on the schedule of the person
undergoing the tests.
   ``Enlisting can take anywhere from a week to a year,'' she said.
``We try to accomodate their schedules.''
   Kiger said 348 non-prior-service recruits and 92 prior-service
recruits wre enlisted during fiscal year 1969. The Guard lost 902
enlisted men during that year, she said.
   Reports that Quayle entered the Guard with the help of his
family's influence have dogged his campaign.
   ``If his family really had all this influence like everyone
says, he would have been sent directly to officer's candidate
school and come out a lieutenant or captain,'' Morell said of
Quayle, whose maternal grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, published
several newspapers in Arizona and Indiana.
   ``Dan was an OK guy,'' Morell said. ``He did his job, and I did
mine. We washed dishes and washed jeeps together.''
   Morell said he would not have found it particularly
objectionable had Quayle received preferential treatment.
   ``If someone would have offered me a hand, I would have shaken
it and said thank you,'' he said. ``I don't want to insinuate he
got a hand, but if he was offered help, any fool would say thank
you. And Dan isn't any fool.''
   Morell said he was forced to drop out of college at Indiana
University for financial reasons and, began considering the
National Guard.
   ``If you weren't a full-time student, you were full-time draft.
There was no in-between,'' he said.
   ``I figured I might as well stay at home, do my weekend a month
and get married,'' Morell said.
   Kiger said the service was below its authorized strength when
the then-22-year-old Quayle signed up.
   ``I can find no evidence that he was given special consideration
and there was no need,'' Kiger said. ``Units that were not up to
100 percent strength could continue to recruit.''
   But Maj. Gen. Alfred Ahner said Tuesday that he received a call
at that time regarding Quayle from Wendell Phillippi, managing
editor of The Indianapolis News, a Pulliam newspaper. Phillippi was
a retired Guard major general.
   Ahner said he contacted the Guard's personnel office on Quayle's
behalf.
   ``They said they had a couple of spaces,'' Ahner said Tuesday.
``I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming over.''

<HEAD>U.S. Negotiators Meet With Officials Over Withdrawal Of Cuban
Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S., South African, Cuban and Angolan
officials met Wednesday to negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   No statement was issued after the four parties met for three
hours, but reporters were told they would meet again Thursday. A
Soviet and United Nations' representative were present in the Congo
capital, but did not attend the talks.
   Chester Crocker, U.S. Assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, met separately with South Africa and the Cuban and Angolan
delegations before the four-party talks began.
   In Luanda, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said the
possibility of peace in Angola has never been nearer since rebels
took up arms against the Portuguese colonial army for independence
of the southern African nation in 1961.
   ``Never as now, since the historic morning of Feb. 4, 1961, has
peace for our heroic and suffering people been so visible on the
horizon,'' dos Santos told members of the People's Assembly, the
country's representative body, in an Angolan news agency report.
   Cuban troops have supported Angola in fighting U.S. and South
Africa-backed UNITA rebels in a guerrilla war against the
Marxist-oriented Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
government. The war has continued since Angola gained its
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Jonas Savimbi's guerrillas of UNITA, which stands for National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, have not been involved
in the talks. The Angolan government refuses to negotiate with
UNITA, calling them bandits and stooges of South Africa.
   UNITA also has refused to adhere to the cease-fire agreement,
which was signed Monday on the Angolan-South-West African frontier
by military representatives from South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   Savimbi's forces have received support the last year from the
United States. President Reagan's administration has pressed Angola
to negotiate with UNITA, saying that no complete peace could be
reached without such a reconciliation.
   Dos Santos said disagreement exists over the timetable for
withdrawal of Cuban troops _ ``South Africa wants them to be out in
12 months, the United States wants 36 months, and Angola and Cuba
have proposed 48 months.''
   But, dos Santos continued, ``all indications are that an
agreement on a timetable will be possible.''
   In Lisbon, news reports have raised the possibility that
Portuguese troops could participate in an international
peace-keeping force in the region.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was quoted by the
French newspaper Le Monde as saying he would accept South Africa's
invitation to visit that country if the Brazzaville talks go well.
   South Africa has said it will withdraw its troops from southern
Angola, where they have supported anti-Marxist rebels as well as
pursued black nationalists seeking to drive them from South-West
Africa, by Sept. 1. This was to be the first phase leading to
elections and independence for South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   But South Africa insisted on a Cuban withdrawal within a year,
saying their continued presence in Angola would pose a threat after
South-West Africa is granted independence.
   In Cape Town, South Africa, President P.W. Botha said Wednesday
that the new leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev has prompted the
Soviet Union to throw its support behind the peace initiative in
Angola and South-West Africa.
   ``The Gorbachev factor is important,'' Botha told Parliament.
   ``This does not mean that the Russians have relinquished their
plans for world domination and have become the world's friendly
neighbor,'' Botha said. ``What it does mean is that Mr. Gorbachev
has realized that the Russian economy cannot support the extremely
expensive involvement in remote regions of the world.''
   The Soviet Union has provided the weaponry for Angola's Marxist
government.

   A new rule to tighten state inspections of
bridges was announced Wednesday by the Federal Highway

   It will require states to list and keep records of bridges with
certain failure-causing features and those that require underwater
and other special inspections.
   But the rule also allows certain bridges to be inspected at
intervals longer than the two years now required. Those include
bridges that are relatively new, are in good condition, are in low
traffic areas and have proven performance histories.

<HEAD>Black Sociologists: Blacks Still See Racism, Just Not As
Frequently</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black people do not encounter racism in their
day-to-day lives as brutally as they did 40 years ago, but they are
always reminded of their racial identity by a society that
emphasizes race in politics and big business, a panel of black
sociologists said Wednesday.
   And while they are aware of efforts to stave off racial attacks,
minorities still believe they are viewed with disdain by a society
that designs its institutions to oppress non-whites, said the
panel, which convened in Atlanta during the annual meeting of the
Association of Black Sociologists.
   ``Institutional ways of handling overt discrimination have
improved, but there has been no significant change in dealing with
white attitudes toward people of color,'' said panelist Myrna
Adams, an administrator at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
   ``We see considerable attention given to overt actions which
could be labeled plain ol' blatant, redneck racism, and it's on the
rise,'' she said.
   Ms. Adams said the incidence of racially motivated violence grew
in proportion to the amount of publicity given the subject. She
said The New York Times published 144 articles on racial attacks in
1987, compared to 16 the previous year.
   The prevailing attitude among whites in American society is that
``anything done for people of color is at their (whites')
expense,'' and little has been done to dispel that sentiment, Ms.
Adams said.
   Joseph Scott, a sociologist at the University of Washington,
said the nation is fighting a new breed of institutional racism
created by an administration that gave too much power to the
private sector.
   ``This society has expounded on an ... economic sector of
governance by private corporations larger than most states, when
you speak of economic units controlling jobs and labor,'' Scott
said.
   He charged that President Reagan is ``putting the private
governance in control of the decisions that used to be wielded by
public government.'' Large corporations then used testing,
screening and access to training to control the flow of minorities
into the private sector, Scott said.
   ``All of these devices, used by bureaucracies, can be used in
the service of white supremacy,'' he said. ``How did that happen if
we have an equal distribution of intelligence, skill and knowledge?
   ``It can only happen because private bureaucracies are able to
use their bureaucratic mechanisms ... to deny the payment of a
living wage to millions of full-time manual and service workers
because they are black and powerless.''
   Scott also charged that the United States uses ``Machiavellian''
principles, such as at-large voting districts, gerrymandering and
willful discrimination in housing practices, to work ``in the
service of white advantage and white affirmative discrimination.''

<HEAD>Students Fighting To Distribute Abortion Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at Ireland's largest university
said Wednesday they would fight an attempt by an anti-abortion
group to keep them from distributing information on legal abortions.
   Earlier this month, the High Court served non-criminal summonses
on four student leaders and an officer at University College,
Dublin, who had refused to agree not to publish the names and
telephone numbers of legal abortion clinics in England.
   Ireland, whose population is 95 percent Roman Catholic, has made
abortion illegal under a 1983 constitutional amendment after a
campaign led by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child.
   The four students said Wednesday they would fight the society's
allegations that they were breaking a Supreme Court ruling that
said it was illegal under the 1983 amendment for pregnancy
counseling centers to provide women with information on how to get
a legal abortion. The Supreme Court has power over the High Court.
   The four students, elected to represent University College's
10,000 students, said they will distribute the abortion information
in a manual to be published in October.
   The anti-abortion group has demanded that the university
administration not provide funds or facilities to aid the students
in publishing the manual. The administration has not responded
publicly.
   ``Our mandate is to provide information on all pregnancy
options,'' said Student Union President Diarmuid Coogan. ``If they
are to succeed in this case, it will have grave implications for
civil liberties in Irish society.''
   Coogan said other colleges, including Dublin's Trinity College,
alsp have stated their intention to provide the names and addresses
of the same clinics. But the anti-abortion society has not taken
any action against the other schools.
   Coogan said University College was being singled out by the
anti-abortion group in a ``witch hunt'' and accused the group of
using the school ``as a pawn in their game.''
   University College welfare officer Anne Marie Keary, who also
received a summons, said 24 women had sought information on
pregnancy and abortion from her since July 1.
   Within three weeks, the anti-abortion society must submit a
detailed argument on their case against the students to the High
Court. The students then have another three weeks to present their
defense.
   During the six weeks, the anti-abortionists may seek a temporary
injuction from the High Court against publication of the manual.
   If the High Court rules in favor of the anti-abortion group, the
students will be banned from distributing the abortion information.
   Last month, Marie Vernon, spokeswoman for the group, said in an
interview: ``The right to life is written into the constitution,
and it overrides the right to information.''

   Two strong quakes shook central
Yugoslavia in the past two days, cracking the walls of some village
homes, it was reported Wednesday.
   The first tremor, at 2:22 a.m., measured 3.4 on the Richter
scale and was centered near the town of Duvno, about 70 miles west
of Sarajevo, according to the Tanjug news agency.
   On Tuesday, a quake with a reading of 4.6 on the Richter scale
was recorded in the same area, the city's observatory said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the immediate area.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ A black bishop who heads the
Anglican Church in South-West Africa was hit by rubber bullets
Wednesday as territorial police confronted student protesters,
local journalists said.
   Bishop James Kauluma was hit on the leg and back by rubber
bullets, sustaining brusies, after he arrived outside the school,
reporters said.
   The state-run radio said 11 people were arrested during the
incident at a secondary school in Katutura, a black township
adjacent to Windhoek, capital of the South African-ruled territory
commonly known as Namibia. An earlier report said up to 40 students
were arrested.
   The protesters reportedly advocated a boycott of classes in
solidarity with pupils in northern Namibia, where a school boycott
has been under way for several months to press demands that
military bases be moved away from schools.

   Some special Democrats who showed up during last
month's Democratic National Convention are looking for a place to
stretch their legs _ all four of them.
   They're the donkeys brought to Georgia's Stone Mountain Park for
the festivities surrounding the party gathering.
   The park plans to keep two of the animals, but is searching for
homes for the rest. They're available for $150 each.
   ``These donkeys are not just no-name personalities,'' said K
Thweatt, public relations manager for the park. ``Neither Dukakis
nor Bentsen has been claimed. I think Jesse Jackson's still there
and I think Grits and Fritz are still there too.
   ``They probably went to more prestigious parties and events than
any of us, so we feel like they're very well-traveled donkeys,''
she said.
   Thweatt said she wasn't told she'd be an agent for donkeys when
she took her job, but it could be worse.
   ``I shudder to think what would've happened to the park if we
had had the Republican Convention,'' she said. ``I can't imagine
all those elephants.''

   Would-be presidential assassin Lynette
``Squeaky'' Fromme and many other prisoners have been transferred
in a major shuffling of female inmates in the federal prison
system, officials said Wednesday.
   Prisons in West Virginia, Kentucky, California and Florida were
most affected by the transfers, which began this month, corrections
officials said.
   A growing female prison population _ partially caused by an
increase in the number of women convicted of drug crimes _ is
forcing the government to shift inmates and open more facilities,
prison officials said.
   Fromme and four other women were moved from the high-security
unit of the federal prison in Lexington, Ky., on Friday when the
unit was shut down. The Lexington facility is being converted into
an all-female medium- and minimum-security prison.
   Fromme, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, and two others
were transferred to a new high-security unit of the Marianna
Federal Correctional Institution in Florida. One was sent to a
California prison, and federal officials refused to identify the
fifth inmate or where she was sent.
   The all-female medium- and high-security facility inside the
Marianna prison, known as the Shawnee Unit, had received 23 other
women as of Wednesday _ 15 from the Alderson Federal Correctional
Institution in West Virginia, seven from the Pleasanton Federal
Correctional Institution in California and one direct commitment,
officials said.
   It eventually will house about 55 inmates and will remain
separate from a all-female low-security camp and a medium-level
men's prison that is under construction, authorities said.
   ``It looks like a combination of an old Roman coliseum and a
garish modern office building,'' Fromme said Wednesday in a
telephone interview from Marianna, in Florida's panhandle.
``There's so much concertina wire it looks like they went into the
hardware business.''
   Fromme said the first floor of the Shawnee Unit was flooded
Tuesday by rain. A prison spokeswoman said she wasn't aware of
flooding but acknowleged some minor problems with the new facility.
   ``It's like when you buy a new house, you work the bugs out,''
said spokeswoman Jama Acuff.
   Many of the women believed they were being transferred to a
nicer facility and some volunteered to go to Florida, said Fromme,
who is serving a life term for attempting to kill then-President
Gerald Ford in 1975.
   Alderson, where Fromme spent 10 years before being moved to
Lexington after she escaped from the West Virginia prison last
year, is being turned into a less secure ``camp'' facility, said
Warden Ron Burkhart.
   ``We're currently reviewing all of our inmates to see who can
reasonably remain in a camp-type setting,'' Burkhart said.
   In addition to Marianna, Alderson high-risk inmates could be
sent to federal prisons in Danbury, Conn., or Pleasanton, Calif.,
he said. About 35 percent of the inmates at Alderson are serving
time for drug trafficking offenses, Burkhart said.
   A female satellite camp at an all-male prison also is under
construction in Phoenix, Ariz., officials said.

   President Reagan touted Republican
presidential nominee George Bush today as a man of action for whom
the backup role of vice president ``didn't come easily.''
   ``George Bush is a man of action _ a man accustomed to
command,'' Reagan said at a Reagan-Bush rally at the hotel where
the president is staying during a break from his California ranch
vacation.
   Bush renewed his criticism of Democrat Michael Dukakis' veto of
a Pledge of Allegiance bill, saying that if confronted with such a
measure he would have left it up to the U.S. Supreme Court to
determine whether it was constitutional.
   ``What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so
much?'' Bush asked.
   Dukakis in 1977 vetoed a bill that would have penalized any
school teacher who failed to lead the pledge every morning.
   ``I would have signed the bill,'' Bush said. ``Any
constitutional question that some might raise should be decided by
the Supreme Court of the United States.''
   Before the rally, Reagan and Bush met privately for 15 minutes
with approximately 50 California supporters and GOP leaders.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and Bush press secretary
Sheila Tate, in a joint statement, said Bush told the group, ``We
will not give away one inch of ground in this state.'' They quoted
Reagan as urging them to ``saddle up and ride hard to exert every
bit as much energy for George as you did for me.''
   Reagan praised Bush at the rally, saying ``The vice presidency
doesn't fit easily on such a man. But George Bush is also a
patriot. And so he made it fit, and he served with a distinction no
one has ever matched.''
   ``I once said he is a great vice president, but I know and I've
seen that it didn't come easily,'' the president said.
   Reagan made no reference to the controversy surrounding the GOP
vice presidential candidate, but he said, ``Dan Quayle stands for
the same principles as George Bush and I do.''
   Reagan heaped scorn on the Democrats in his speech, saying they
had fielded ``a three-headed ticket that doesn't know left from
center'' _ a reference to presidential nominee Michael Dukakis,
running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and runnerup Jesse Jackson.
   ``They talk about reaching for the center, but on issues like
national defense, they've taken positions that only a McGovern
could love,'' he said, reaching back to 1972 when liberal Sen.
George McGovern of South Dakota was the Democratic presidential
nominee.
   On Tuesday, Reagan signed a landmark trade bill on a pier at
Long Beach and spoke at a rally in Irvine for Republican Sen. Pete
Wilson of California.
   As he left the platform in Long Beach, the president replied
with a firm ``No'' when asked whether Bush should drop his running
mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, from the ticket.
   ``He's a fine man and well qualified for the job,'' Reagan said
of Quayle, who is the center of controversy over his military and
academic record.
   California Sen. Alan Cranston, the second-ranking Democrat in
the Senate, was among officials on the platform as Reagan signed
legislation designed to reduce U.S. deficits in world trade.
   The president's signature climaxed three years of skirmishing
between the White House and Capitol Hill, but clearly did not mark
an end to partisan debate over the trade issue.
   ``In 1981, George Bush and I arrived in Washington committed to
getting government out of your way,'' Reagan told an audience of
port officials, dock workers and others.
   Using an old nautical term, Reagan described the U.S. economy as
yare, meaning ``easy to handle, quick to respond, bright, lively.''
   ``This bill will allow us to provide up to a billion dollars a
year for retraining workers to adjust to our turbo-charge economy _
an economy that, with the right leader, will remain yare,'' he said.
   In his fund-raising address for Wilson, who is challenged by
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, Reagan said, ``America is not
going to trade away our winning team for third-stringers with a
weak defense, a foreign policy of errors, curveball campaign
promises, a set of policies to be named later, and billions of
dollars in higher taxes.''
   The speech is expected to be the first of many on behalf of GOP
Senate candidates as well as the Bush-Quayle ticket.
   The president has two political appearances _ for California
Republicans in Thousand Oaks and for Rep. Robert Lagomarsino in
Santa Barbara _ scheduled Saturday on his way back to his ranch.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president also is expected
to visit eight to 15 cities on behalf of GOP candidates after he
returns to Washington on Sept. 6.

   Burundi's ruling party on Wednesday
threatened to deal a ``death blow'' to instigators of tribal
warfare that left 5,000 people dead and sent about 40,000 fleeing
across the border.
   The refugees pouring into Burundi's northern neighbor, Rwanda,
claim the Burundi army, which along with the government is
dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, is taking part in a mass
slaughter of the nation's majority Hutu tribe.
   A U.N. official said there was evidence refugees were wounded by
troops. But a senior Western diplomat in Burundi said ``the idea
the army is massacring Hutus, burning huts, etc., is just not what
we're hearing here.''
   ``Non-governmental sources, including missionaries coming down
from the north, say the army is acting with a great deal of
restraint,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition his name not
be used.
   But he said the army ``still is engaged in fighting with
dissident Hutus.''
   The ruling Union for National Progress party issued a statement
vowing ``to deal a death blow to outsiders who have been inciting
peaceful Burundians to cause trouble in the country,'' according to
state-run Radio Burundi.
   The statement did not refer directly to refugees' claims of army
involvement in a slaughter, but urged Burundians to desist from
listening to ``foreign propaganda and false reports by foreign
media.''
   The Hutu People Liberation Party, an exiled opposition group,
has charged that Burundi's military massacred thousands of Hutus.
   The government has denied the accusations and claims 5,000
people were killed in a slaughter instigated by exiled Hutus who
infiltrated the tiny central African country to inflame anti-Tutsi
sentiment.
   Despite making up nearly 85 percent of Burundi's 5 million
people, the Hutu are subservient to the Tutsi, who comprise the
remaining 15 percent and dominate the government and army.
   The Hutu and the Tutsi are longtime enemies. Following an
abortive 1972 coup attempt in the former Belgian colony, the Tutsi
massacred more than 100,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's
intelligentsia, according to human rights groups.
   As of Tuesday, about 38,000 refugees had fled into Rwanda since
the violence began Aug. 14, and an estimated 5,000 peasants
continue to cross the border daily, said Code Cisse, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees representative in Rwanda.
   ``We saw many people who had been injured by bullets and
bayonets,'' Cisse said in a telephone interview. ``They said they
were fleeing because they didn't want to get shot by the military.''
   Most of those fleeing are members of the Hutu tribe, said Cisse,
who visited border areas over the weekend.
   Rwanda, a densely populated and impoverished nation, has
appealed for international aid to cope with the influx of refugees
which it says are straining its meager resources.
   Burundi, meanwhile, has promised to work with those who fled to
Rwanda and to make possible a speedy return home.
   Details about what sparked the current violence are sketchy.
   Refugees told Cisse the unrest began Aug. 5-6 with local
opposition to an army attempt to arrest some Hutu, although the
mass killing did not start until more than a week later.
   Diplomats in Burundi, however, said they understood Hutu
initially turned on Tutsi.
   The region where most of the killing took place is in Burundi's
north, a remote hilly and marshy region, around the farming
communies of Ntega and Marangara. The army has since sealed off the
region.
   The government has restricted travel between towns, enforced a
dusk-to-dawn curfew nationwide and banned meetings of more than
five people.
   The massacre was the first reported violence since Maj. Pierre
Buyoya seized power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987, while former
President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza was attending a Francophone summit
in Canada.
   Burundi covers an area about the size of Maryland. About 6
million people live in slightly smaller Rwanda. There, the
Hutu-Tutsi percentages are roughly equal, although the Hutu
dominate the government.

<HEAD>Quayle Defended By Controversial Federal Judge and Friend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court judge once
branded by opponents as unfit for the federal bench said Wednesday
the smooth political career of his law school friend, Dan Quayle,
left ill-prepared to handle controversy.
   Daniel A. Manion, a Vietnam veteran and conservative Republican,
dismissed questions about Quayle's Vietnam-era service in the
National Guard and a claim by former Washington lobbyist Paula
Parkinson that Quayle propositioned her during a 1980 Florida
vacation.
   Manion said Quayle should remain on the Republican ticket as
George Bush's running mate. But he said Quayle's political career
might have gone better if Bush had chosen someone else.
   ``He walked into this thing unimpeded,'' Manion said.
   Quayle scored upset victories over incumbent Democrats to win
seats in the House and Senate and easily won re-election to the
Senate in 1986.
   ``From a guy who could walk down the street unrecognized, bang,
he's suddenly put in the spotlight,'' Manion said. ``He was
unprepared, and that's probably not a very good way to put a vice
president in.''
   Manion became a controversial figure when President Reagan
nominated him in 1986 for an appeals court judgeship. Opponents on
the Senate Judiciary Committee attacked him as poorly qualified and
ideologically extreme.
   It was Quayle who telephoned Manion's South Bend law office from
Capitol Hill to tell him of his narrow confirmation victory.
   Manion, a former Army supply officer in Vietnam in 1966, said
questions about Quayle's use of family influence to enter the
National Guard and avoid Vietnam combat in 1969 dealt with
``obscure things'' that should not prevent government service.
   Manion also defended Quayle's emotional response to Ms.
Parkinson's claim that he propositioned her eight years ago.
   ``He's a strong family man,'' Manion said. ``He's not one of
these philanderers who goes looking for lost weekends. He is a
golfer and that's why he went.''
   Manion and Quayle attended the Indiana University School of Law
together. Manion was graduated a year ahead of Quayle in 1973.
``Very personable, nice fellow,'' Manion said. ``He was just kind
of an average guy.''
   Manion said he expects the controversies over Quayle to fade,
and would advise the Republican ticket to ride out the storm.
   ``I say, man, you're on the horse, you ride it,'' he said. ``It
may not be the one you thought had the speed, but you hope it's got
the endurance.''

   The pain was so extreme the patient prayed
to die and endured ``living hell for 40 minutes'' as he lay awake
through gall bladder surgery, according to testimony at a medical
negligence trial.
   Lynn Wahls ``couldn't move, he couldn't talk, he couldn't
scream, he couldn't do anything'' due to muscle relaxants and the
insertion of a tube down his throat, attorney Robert Strodel told a
Peoria County jury during opening arguments Tuesday.
   Wahls felt the surgeon cut into his abdomen, move several organs
about and snip out his gall bladder, Strodel said, and should be
compensated for the ordeal.
   The attorney contends the anesthesiologist, Dr. Kuo-Tung
``Kenneth'' Cheng, was negligent during the February 1987 operation
at Proctor Community Hospital.
   ``The evidence will not show that Cheng is a bad doctor,''
Strodel said. ``He's not. But in this one case, he was negligent.''
   Cheng's attorney, Richard Quinn, disputed the contention that
Wahls felt extreme pain.
   ``There's no way he felt what he claims he felt,'' Quinn said,
adding ``I'm not here to tell you he didn't feel'' some discomfort
or pain.
   He said Cheng used the recommended dosage of anesthetic.
   Wahls, who lost consciousness later in the procedure, is seeking
at least $15,000 in damages from Cheng.
   Wahls, a Peoria County deputy coroner, contends he heard
everything said by the surgical team during the first 40 minutes of
surgery, including surgeons' remarks about his obesity and his
professional honesty.
   Strodel paraphrased the remarks Wahls said he heard: ``He's a
deputy coroner. You know what deputy coroners do. They get out
before anybody else and rip off (steal from) dead bodies.''
   Quinn said Wahls' obesity was a factor in deciding how deeply to
sedate the patient without endangering his chances for safe
recovery from the anesthetic.
   He said Cheng administered as much of the anesthetic as the
manufacturer recommended.
   Quinn said expert anesthesiologists would prove Cheng, who has
practiced in Peoria for 14 years, was not negligent in his
treatment of Wahls.
   Strodel said his own expert would use Cheng's own notes from the
surgery to prove Wahls ``was aware'' during surgery and in pain.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World output of poultry meat is up 3 percent
this year and is expected to gain further in 1989, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   A survey of 51 major producing countries by the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service showed 1988 poultry meat production at
30.12 million metric tons, up from 29.21 million last year. The
forecast for 1989 is for 31.09 million tons.
   The European Economic Community and the United States account
for most of this year's increase, while Brazil will be a major
contributor in 1989, the report said.
   Six countries, combined with the 12-nation EEC, account for 23.1
million tons of this year's poultry meat total and 23.8 million
tons of the 1989 forecast.
   Looking at the 1989 forecast, the report showed U.S. production
at 9.79 million tons; Brazil, 2 million; Canada, 700,000; EEC, 6.01
million; Hungary, 500,000; Soviet Union, 3.3 million; and Japan,
1.5 million.
   Other countries, not listed, are expected to account for 7.29
million tons in 1989.
   World egg production is expected to be up 1 percent this year,
with the largest increase in the Soviet Union. Production is
expected to grow more slowly in 1989, the report said.

   Actor Howard Rollins Jr., through his
attorney, pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges of possession of
cocaine, driving while intoxicated and speeding.
   State Judge Freddie Pitcher Jr. agreed to waive the presence of
the 37-year-old actor and allowed attorney Jim Boren to enter the
plea.
   The judge didn't set a trial date.
   Rollins was arrested in March while he was in Louisiana filming
the NBC television series, ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   A trooper reported Rollins was driving more than 100 mph on
Interstate 12. Police said they found two bags of a substance which
turned out to be cocaine.
   Rollins, of Baltimore, had leading roles in the films
``Ragtime'' and ``A Soldier's Story.''

<HEAD>Conservative Economist Questions Bush's Promise of 30 Million Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative economist Arthur B. Laffer on
Wednesday questioned Republican nominee George Bush's goal of
creating 30 million new jobs in eight years as president.
   At a news conference for GOP Senate candidate Joseph Malone,
Laffer said 20 million jobs in eight years might be an attainable
figure.
   Bush's goal is ``a large number'' and an estimate ``that I would
not have made,'' Laffer said.
   ``Whether 30 million is a reasonable or optimistic goal or not,
the point is you want to keep those jobs going, keep that
prosperity going,'' he said.
   The 48-year-old economist is best known for the ``Laffer Curve''
which holds that beyond a certain point, increasing taxes won't
increase government revenues because high taxes slow down the
economy.
   Bush talked about creating 30 million new jobs in his acceptance
speech at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans last
week. He spoke of his goal of creating ``30 in eight _ 30 million
new jobs in the next eight years.''
   On Tuesday, Bush's aides retreated somewhat from the vice
president's declaration. They said Bush used 30 million as a goal
rather than a promise.
   The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics recently
projected a growth of 18.4 million jobs over the next 12 years.
   ``That 30 million I don't think is a number you should focus
on,'' Laffer said. ``Twenty million would get the point across.''
   Laffer, a Californian and member of President Reagan's Economic
Policy Advisory Board, questioned Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis' contribution as governor to the economic growth of
Massachusetts.
   Laffer said the Dukakis administration created its own deficit
problems by overestimating tax revenues in the state. But Laffer
agreed with Dukakis that more should be done to collect delinquent
federal taxes.

<HEAD>New Move to Switch to Metric System Buried in Trade Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American efforts to switch to the metric
system are set to get a major boost from a little-noted feature of
the trade bill President Reagan signed into law this week, a
congressman says.
   ``This metric provision could be one of the best kept secrets of
the trade bill,'' Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., the sponsor, said
Tuesday in a statement.
   The law requires the federal government to start doing business
with its private suppliers under the metric system _ centimeters
instead of inches, kilograms instead of pounds and liters instead
of gallons _ starting in 1992.
   A deliberate loophole has been left for cases in which the
changeover would not be cost-effective. But Brown said a broad
range of business could be affected by the measure.
   Albert Navas, president of the American National Metric Council,
called the provision ``outstanding'' and ``long-needed to
accelerate the metric conversion process'' in the United States.
   The United States is now one of only three countries not using
the metric system, based on the number 10. The other nations that
have not adopted it are Burma and Liberia, he said. Some nations
have made only a partial conversion.
   ``It's still 90 miles from Stratford-on-Avon to London, not
kilometers,'' even though Britain has adopted the system, Navas
said. ``And football fields won't change to the metric system. I'd
be against that, myself.''
   There have been efforts to put the United States on the metric
system for more than a decade, including 1975 legislation. But
progress has been slow. Not everyone is thrilled with the idea.
   One opponent is the National Federation of Independent
Businesses, a Washington group whose 550,000 members around the
country have an average of 10 employees and gross annual sales of
around $350,000.
   ``The NFIB is opposed to a conversion to the metric system
because quite frankly it's difficult,'' said chief House lobbyist
David Rehr. ``Given the size of their businesses it would be very
costly both to convert to metric and, in the case of federal
contracts, to make necessary adjustments.''
   Brown said that proponents were careful not to put the spotlight
on the metric provisions in the legislation for fear of arousing
more critics.
   ``Our strategy was to downplay the metric language in order to
avoid confrontation with those who might oppose the measure without
fully understanding its provisions,'' Brown said. ``Now that the
trade bill is enacted, however, I want everyone to know that this
country is finally taking real steps to convert to metric.''

   Federal engineers have opened an investigation
of claims that the rear seat belts on 1.7 million Ford Escort and
Mercury Lynx cars can cripple passengers in a crash, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday.
   But the agency said the belts, which have an unusual design,
comply with federal standards.
   NHTSA granted part of a petition by a La Plata, Md., couple,
Larry and Patricia Garrett, whose son was crippled in a 1985
accident while riding in a Ford Escort.
   The Garretts through their attorneys alleged a strap retainer
causes the rear seat belts on the Escort and Lynx cars to ride up
on the passenger's waist rather than settling around the hips,
greatly increasing the likelihood of serious injury in accidents.
   In the event of a collision, they said, a seat belt over the
waist cuts through softer parts of the body to the spinal column,
while the hips provide a large mass of bone that enables a belt to
hold a passenger in place without serious injury.
   The Garretts last December won a $3.3 million judgment against
Ford Motor Co. for their son's injuries.
   NHTSA in a letter said, ``Based on the limited information
gathered in our technical review, we are unable to conclude that
the strap retainer has had an adverse effect on the performance of
the system.
   ``However, testing did indicate that the Escort and Lynx rear
safety belts with and without the strap retainer fit differently on
test subjects compared to rear safety belts in some other cars.''
   The agency said its investigation was needed ``to understand the
safety effects of the different fit of these belts.''
   NHTSA's engineering analysis, a mid-level investigation, covers
1984-1988 Escort and Lynx cars.
   Ford said after the petition was filed that the seat belts were
positioned properly during the Garretts' accident, and it
attributed their son's crippling injury to the force of the crash.
   The automaker on Wednesday vowed to cooperate with NHTSA's
investigation and expressed confidence the agency would find no
safety-related defect in the belts.
   The belts ``meet or exceed all federal lmotor vehicle safety
standard performance requirements, including those for location,
fit, strength and ease of use,'' Ford said.
   A Washington attorney for the Garretts, Harold Sakayan, accused
NHTSA of trying to put the case ``on the back burner for awhile''
in response to congressional critics.
   ``The letter they sent us today acknowledged there was a
problem,'' Sakayan said. ``They acknowledge that the belt didn't
fit the way it should. They didn't tell us what the problem was?
What are they waiting for if there was a problem?''
   James Garrett, then 11, was buckled into the back seat of the
Escort when it crashed into a tractor-trailer truck near Annapolis,
Md.
   Two front-seat occupants were hospitalized but were spared
crippling injuries, despite the crumpling of the passenger
compartment in the head-on crash.
   James became a paraplegic as a result of injuries in the crash,
and another back-seat passenger, 14-year-old Christopher Gaboury,
was killed.
   While investigating the safety of the Escort and Lynx belts,
NHTSA continues to believe that ``you are far better off wearing
any kind of belt than no belt at all,'' said Ron DeFore, a
spokesman for the agency.

   Commercial flower growers will have a new,
genetically engineered dwarf version of the long-stemmed lisianthus
by next spring, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Roger H. Lawson of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said the deep-purple lisianthus may be the first commercial
flower developed through biotechnology research.
   he dwarf lisianthus will be sold as potted plants, rather than
seed, and will be available in April 1989, he said. It will be made
available by the Society of American Florists and USDA.
   Lawson, who heads up a new floral crops program funded jointly
by USDA and the floral society, said the new plant bears several
tulip-sized blooms at once, is a 6- to 10-inch mutation of a
2-foot-tall lisianthus that is popular in many parts of the world
as a cut flower.
   Wild lisianthus grows throughout the American prairie region, he
said.

   Heavy rains this month flooded about
25,000 people out of their homes on the isolated Caribbean coast
and destroyed thousands of acres of subsistence crops, officials
said Wednesday.
   Reynaldo Antonio Tefel, Minister of Social Welfare, said the
majority of those affected are Indians who live mostly on corn and
whatever else they can grow.
   He said 37 tons of food had been sent to the area and the
government is asking the United Nations and the Red Cross for help.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista party, said
Switzerland and Norway plan to donate food and other aid.
   The remote, jungled region is home to about 155,000 people, most
of them Suma, Rama orMiskito Indians. Many of their wooden homes
are built on stilts to avoid damage by floods when rivers rise
during the rainy season.
   A preliminary survey by the National Emergency Commission showed
90 percent of the area's crops were destroyed, Tefel said, and
``this means those 25,000 people will need food for the next six
months.''
   He said the leftist Sandinista government was short of funds
because of economic difficulties created by the 7-year-old war the
U.S. backed rebels.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Salome Valle estimated 80 percent of the
corn, yucca and bean crops were damaged. She said the Red Cross had
provided shelter to about 3,000 people.

<HEAD>Conservative Group Accuses TV Networks of Pro-Dukakis Bias</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative media watchdog group accused
the four major television networks Wednesday of displaying
``blatant anti-conservative bias'' in their coverage of the
Democratic and Republican nominating conventions this summer.
   L. Brent Bozell, founder and chairman of the Media Research
Center, said his group analyzed 100 hours of prime-time coverage on
ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN and found ``a seriously flawed double
standard'' among the networks.
   The media ``let Michael Dukakis get away with murder'' at the
Democratic convention in Atlanta by failing to report on issues,
Bozell said.
   At the Republican convention in New Orleans, he said, ``the
media spent too much time looking for scoops'' when they should
have been reporting on issues.
   The Media Research Center rated CNN best of the four networks it
studied, followed by NBC, ABC and CBS.
   Bozell's group looked at the ideological labels network
reporters and commentators used, their choice of who to interview,
the types of questions they asked, which if any controversies they
highlighted and whether the coverage was valuable to the viewer.
   Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, the controversial GOP vice
presidential candidate, was the subject of 432 of the 889 questions
posed by network questioners during prime-time coverage of the New
Orleans convention, Bozell said.
   Of 190 citations of all GOP controversies, he said, there were
140 mentions of Quayle's service in the Indiana National Guard
during the Vietnam War.
   By comparison, he said, there were only four mentions of
controversy during the Democratic convention. He said there were
three comments about the ethics investigation of House Speaker Jim
Wright and one on vice presidential nominee Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's
former fund-raising breakfast club for lobbyists.
   Bozell said said the Quayle issue would not have come up 140
times if questions had been answered better initially. ``If the
Bush people had handled it better, there's no question'' that fewer
questions would have been raised, he said.
   Robert Lichter, co-director of the non-partisan Center for Media
and Public Affairs, said Quayle's selection during the convention
made it inevitable that he would be scrutinized quickly and
intensely by reporters.
   Lichter blamed the focus on Quayle partly on the Republicans.
   ``The Republicans handed the material to the media, who then
proceeded to tailor it,'' he said. ``If Quayle had had the right
answers at the beginning, he could have defused a lot of this
controversy.''
   Lichter has been analyzing ABC, CBS and NBC political coverage
since the start of the primary season. He said network coverage of
the two parties ``pretty well balanced out'' during the primaries.

   The AFL-CIO officially endorsed Michael
Dukakis for president on Wednesday, and labor leaders said they can
deliver the Massachusetts Democrat a margin of 2.5 million union
votes in November.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told Dukakis the endorsement
``represents our commitment to work for you in every state in the
union,'' but a spokesman for Republican George Bush called the
endorsement ``a classic dog bites man story.''
   The presidents of the labor federation's 91 affiliated unions
voted 95.7 percent of their 14.1 million members in favor of a
Dukakis endorsement, with only three unions abstaining entirely.
Not a single union worker was counted in the AFL-CIO tally as
favoring an endorsement of Republican George Bush.
   However, among those unions abstaining was the largest, the 1.6
million-member Teamsters, who in 1980 and 1984 endorsed Ronald
Reagan after making no presidential endorsement in 1976.
   Newly installed Teamster President William McCarthy of Boston,
who sources in the union say personally dislikes Dukakis, said he
is withholding an endorsement until a mail poll of his members is
completed Sept. 16.
   Asked if the Teamsters could endorse Bush, an official in the
union said, ``I just don't see it.''
   ``If the poll comes back strong for Dukakis, we'll probably
endorse him,'' said the Teamster official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``If it's close, we'll probably remain
neutral.''
   The 30,000-member Air Line Pilots Association and the
40,000-member Marine Engineers union also voted to abstain from
making a presidential endorsement. The Newspaper Guild voted 4,000
of its 25,390 members as abstaining primarily because of opposition
to any endorsement by its Wire Service Guild local.
   Kirkland had estimated earlier that the federation's endorsement
of Walter Mondale in 1984 was worth a net 2 million votes despite
exit polls showing that as many as 47 percent of voters from union
households cast their ballots then for Reagan.
   ``Our rule of thumb is that we have to do two-thirds or better
in order to be successful in the election,'' he said. ``We fell
short of that. I'm reasonably confident that the results this time
will be improved.''
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin, calling the endorsement ``a
classic dog-bites-man story,'' said, ``Every four years the AFL-CIO
trots out what has become an obligatory endorsement of a Democratic
presidential candidate and 1988 is obviously no exception.''
   Communications Workers President Morton Bahr said four polls of
his union's members in the past year show that those who voted for
Reagan in 1984 _ a slight majority, according to political
operatives in the union _ ``are coming home to the Democratic
party.''
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber said a poll of his
union's members in July and August at 28 sites showed 96.9 percent
favoring a Dukakis endorsement.
   ``Obviously we had a lot of people in 1980 and 1984 who made a
mistake,'' Bieber said, citing the loss of hundreds of thousands of
jobs in the past seven years, including a 52 percent decline in
farm and heavy equipment factories alone. ``The attitude of our
members has changed.''
   The 1.3 million-member United Food and Commercial Workers, which
has a higher concentration of Republicans than most unions, said
its latest telephone poll showed a two-to-one edge for Dukakis
among those members who had made up their minds.
   ``For the first time in four years, a majority of our members
classify themselves as Democrats with fewer than 24 percent calling
themselves Republicans,'' said UFCW President William Wynn, who
noted that his union's members split even on Mondale and Reagan
four years ago.

<HEAD>Illinois Senator Visits Soweto, Meets Tutu</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Simon meeting Bishop Desmond Tutu,

chairman.</NOTE>

   Sen. Paul Simon visited black
squatters Wednesday in Soweto, met with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
renewed his clemency appeal for the Sharpeville Six, a group of
blacks facing execution.
   The Illinois Democrat, on a five-day trip to South Africa,
conferred briefly with Prakash Diar, lawyer for the Sharpeville
Six. The five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for
involvement in a mob that killed a black town councilor in 1984 in
Sharpeville, a township south of Johannesburg.
   Later, Simon spent about 30 minutes with Tutu, leader of the
Anglican church in southern Africa and winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize for his campaign against South Africa's apartheid
system of race segregation.
   Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Simon predicted that
Congress will toughen sanctions against South Africa. As chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on African affairs,
Simon will have a major role in that decision.
   Congress ``would be eager to avoid sanctions if we got a good
strong clear signal from the government here that they were going
to do away with apartheid,'' Simon said. ``But I'm not getting that
signal.''
   He contends that sanctions could push the white authorities
toward reform.
   Before meeting Tutu, Simon toured Soweto, the black township of
2.5 million people outside Johannesburg. He also visited two
squatter camps and an all-male hostel for migrant workers.
   ``I've just spoken with a man with five children who sees his
family only once a year,'' Simon said after emerging from the
hostel. ``This is an illustration of what happens under a system of
injustice based on racial separation.''
   Simon also met with Albertina Sisulu, a prominent anti-apartheid
activist whose husband, Walter, is serving life in prison with
fellow African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   Simon is leading a U.S. campaign seeking clemency for the
Sharpeville Six, whose case has drawn worldwide attention.
President P.W. Botha has refused to intervene. They were granted a
reprieve in March hours before they were to be executed.
   Diar will argue the case before the Appeal Court next month.
   His clients did not physically contribute to the death of the
councilor, according to court testimony. They were convicted under
the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which holds them responsible
for being an active part of the mob that carried out the killing.
   ``There is a feeling that the system has not provided justice
for a great many people, and to some extent the Sharpeville Six are
a symbol of that,'' Simon said.
   He said his request to visit with the Sharpeville Six was turned
down but he planned to mention the case in a scheduled meeting
Thursday with Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha.

   A Navy skipper believes he acted properly in
declining to take aboard a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who
later reportedly turned to cannibalism to survive, the officer's
attorney said Wednesday.
   ``The captain is confident that what he did was correct given
the facts and circumstances,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Ron Petronio, the
attorney for Capt. Alexander G. Balian, who provided supplies to
the refugees.
   Balian, 48, of Los Angeles faces a possible court-martial for
alleged dereliction of duty.
   Balian informed the Navy Tuesday that he would exercise his
right not to attend an ``admiral's mast'' disciplinary hearing that
had been scheduled for Wednesday before Vice Adm. George Davis,
head of the Pacific Fleet's surface forces.
   Under military law, Davis now must decide whether to drop the
matter or order an Article 32 hearing. Such a hearing, similar to a
civilian grand jury proceeding, is the first step in a full
military court-martial.
   ``It's not that he would not get a fair hearing, because he
would have. But the nature of the (admiral's mast) proceedings are
such that they're not public'' and Balian's side of the story would
not have come out, Petronio said.
   Balian, who was skipper of the amphibious landing ship USS
Dubuque, is charged with failing to render appropriate assistance
to the refugees and violating a standing order to aid and rescue
refugees found at sea in life-threatening situations. He was
temporarily relieved of command Aug. 13.
   The charges were prepared for Balian's administrative hearing
and could be changed if a court-martial is ordered.
   According to Navy officials, the Dubuque encountered the refugee
boat June 9 in the South China Sea while en route to the Persian
Gulf.
   Balian gave the refugees several hundred pounds of supplies,
including food, water and navigational aids, but didn't take the
estimated 110 people aboard because he judged their vessel
seaworthy, according to the Navy.
   The refugees, who left Ben Tre in southern Vietnam on May 22,
were at sea 37 days before fishermen from the Philippines rescued
them on June 28. Only 52 survived.
   Some of the survivors have been quoted as saying they killed and
ate some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they
encountered the Dubuque on June 9. Two of the victims reportedly
died of starvation, but three others allegedly were murdered
through drowning and then eaten.
   The Navy and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees are
investigating the reports.
   Petronio said Balian would have no comment until the Navy
decides whether or not to proceed with a court-martial.
   ``He's a very loyal Navy officer who's not going to buck the
system,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Grant For AIDS Drug To Expire Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal payments for the drug AZT are running out for about
6,000 AIDS patients nationwide, and many may be forced into poverty
to qualify for the life-prolonging drug under Medicaid, officials
said Wednesday.
   A one-time, emergency appropriation of $30 million was enacted
by Congress last summer to help those AIDS patients who couldn't
afford the $8,000-a-year treatment, had inadequate health insurance
and made too much money to qualify for Medicaid.
   About a fifth of all AIDS patients in the country are receiving
AZT under the grant, according to Richard Schulman of the Federal
Health Resources and Services Administration.
   AZT, or azidothymidine, has been shown to prolong the lives of
some AIDS patients but has severe side effects.
   Because few states have taken action to continue funding, many
of those patients may be forced to ``spend down until they reach
Medicaid level,'' Schulman said.
   ``You use your own resources until you're out of money and you
qualify for Medicaid, which can be pretty devastating,'' he said.
``That's what's going to happen, I have no doubt about it.''
   AIDS activists have criticized the states for not continuing the
program. The federal program technically expires Sept. 30 when the
government's fiscal year ends, but states with surpluses at that
time will be allowed to continue supporting their AIDS patients
until their AZT money runs out, officials said.
   In Florida, the money has already run out, despite extra funds
voted by the Legislature.
   ``Congress made it very clear to the states that they needed to
pick up the slack once this (federal) program expired,'' said Jeff
Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force. ``It is unfortunate that the states have waited until the
last minute to react.''
   Levi suggested that Congress enact ``some type of matching
program'' during the transition to state funding.
   ``It doesn't make a lot of economic sense to have people who are
working to stop working ... and go on Social Security so they can
get Medicaid to get a very expensive drug that may not work,'' said
Larry Kessler, director of Boston's AIDS Action Committee.
   So far, only the District of Columbia has actually appropriated
money to continue the program after the grant expires, Schulman
said.
   The fiscal 1989 budget includes $250,000 for emergency drug
assistance, says Jane Silver, who administers the district's AIDS
office. However, the district's budget still must be approved by
Congress.
   While no state has acted to continue AZT funding for all those
receiving it under the grant, six states _ Arkansas, Florida,
Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas _ have changed their
Medicaid rules to cover the drug for the poorest patients.
   Only in Alabama and Colorado is AZT not paid for by Medicaid.
   The $30 million AZT grant was disbursed proportionately among
the states based on the number of AIDS patients as of July 1987.
Money from some states that had overestimated their need was later
transferred to other states.
   New York, which has more AIDS cases than any other state, got
the most, about $8.5 million, and has helped about 900 patients so
far.
   According to Barbara McTague, director of New York's AIDS Drug
Assistance Program, the money is expected to last a year beyond the
grant expiration. As a result, there is as yet no legislative push
to come up with state money to continue to program, she said.
   Schulman said most states with surpluses will be allowed to keep
the money provided it is spent on AZT. Normally, unspent grant
money must be returned to the Treasury at the end of the fiscal
year, Sept. 30.
   California was next with $7.6 million for 1,500 patients. It was
followed by Texas, which got $2.1 million to treat 520 patients,
according to Donna Marler, the AZT coordinator for the Texas
Department of Health. She said the Texas Legislature, which
convenes in January, will be asked to provide state money for AIDS
treatment.
   Florida got the fourth largest grant of $1.7 million, and later
received an additional $329,000 from states where the money was not
needed. When the state still overspent the grants in treating about
630 patients over the year, the Legislature appropriated an extra
$278,000.
   Still, Schulman said, Florida was forced to discontinue the
grant program about five weeks ago. The deficit stemmed primarily
from the fact that until July 1, Medicaid in Florida did not pay
for AZT.

   Two executives of a New Jersey marketing firm
and three other people have been indicted on charges of rigging
California promotional contests and awarding prizes to friends and
relatives.
   Prizes involved in the alleged scheme included a $14,000
Mustang, a $28,500 Corvette and $25,000 in cash, according to
Tuesday's 13-count indictment.
   The games were sold by C & K Marketing to the Alpha Beta
supermarket chain and the Taco Bell fast-food chain, but neither
Alpha Beta nor Taco Bell took part in the fraud, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney David Katz.
   Named in the indictment were C & K's president, John Edward
Curtin III, 37, of Sea Girt, N.J; vice president Kevin Joseph
Kissane, 35, of Brielle, N.J.; Curtin's brother, Kim John Curtin,
35, of South Laguna, Calif.; auto dealer Jerome S. Baratta, 56, of
Port Au Peck, N.J.; and James Frederick Lee, 50, of San Diego.
   The defendants were scheduled to be arraigned in federal court
here Sept. 6.
   The indictment alleges mail fraud, wire fraud, aiding and
abetting and use of misleading conduct.
   The Alpha Beta game was called ``California Dreamin''' and Taco
Bell's game was dubbed ``Wheels, Reels and Meals.''
   The indictment said Kim Curtin gave his friend James Lee the
winning ticket for the Mustang in the Alpha Beta contest in 1985
and John Curtin and Kissane rigged the Taco Bell game the following
year to make Lee the winner of the Corvette.
   In the Taco Bell game, Lee elected to take $28,500 in cash
instead of the car, but his victory was on paper only and the
marketing company kept the money, the indictment alleged.
   Lee acknowledged winning the Mustang and selling it for $12,000,
but he declined to say if Kim Curtin had given him the winning
ticket. He declined to comment further.
   Baratta, a relative of Kissane, was the arranged winner of a
$25,000 second prize in the Taco Bell game and the money actually
went back to the company, according to the indictment.
   Baratta said he was unaware the contest was a setup. The Curtins
and Kissane declined comment.

<HEAD>Bush Blasts Dukakis at Reagan-Bush Pep Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush renewed his
criticism of rival Michael Dukakis' stand on the Pledge of
Allegiance on Wednesday, accusing the Democrat of ``looking for a
reason'' to avoid signing a bill requiring teachers and students to
say the pledge.
   ``What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so
much?'' Bush queried at a high-voltage pep rally, where he was
joined by President Reagan in their first post-GOP convention
campaign appearance.
   ``I would have signed that bill,'' Bush said. ``Let's face it _
my opponent was looking for a reason not to sign that bill _ I
would have looked for a reason to sign it.''
   Battered by questions over the military record of his running
mate Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., during their first week of
campaigning, Bush appeared intent on focusing the attention
elsewhere.
   Bush's renewed emphasis on the issue came one day after Dukakis
questioned Bush's ``dedication to the Constitution and the rule of
law'' on the matter. Dukakis said Bush had ``no business'' running
for the White House if he was willing to sign a bill that he knew
to be unconstitutional.
   The vice president used the pledge to wrap up his acceptance
speech to the Republican convention. And twice recently, Bush
faulted Dukakis at campaign appearances because the governor vetoed
a bill in 1977 that would have penalized any school teacher who
failed to lead students in the pledge every morning.
   Dukakis says he rejected the bill because the Massachusetts
Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional.
   Bush used his appearance with Reagan to argue the matter should
be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.
   ``I find it hard to believe that the Founding Fathers would have
objected to teachers leading students in the Pledge of
Allegiance,'' Bush said.
   The vice president also faulted his Democratic rival with being
weak on defense and crime as well as eager to raise taxes.
   ``We can't take another gamble'' by putting a Democratic
governor like Jimmy Carter in the White House, Bush contended.
   ``We must have tough, experienced leadership ... which someone
who's been there and someone you can trust _ I am that man,'' Bush
said.
   Reagan has appeared several times in his home state to press the
cause of his vice president. California, with its rich deployment
of 47 electoral votes, is seen by both campaigns as essential for
winning the White House.
   In his remarks to the crowd of several thousand at the Century
Plaza Hotel, Reagan contended Bush will shift gears smoothly from
being a loyal No. 2 to being a strong president because he is ``a
man of action _ a man accustomed to command.''
   The president argued that being a loyal No. 2 isn't always a
simple job.
   ``The vice presidency doesn't fit easily on such a man. But
George Bush is also a patriot. And so he made it fit and he served
with a distinction no one has ever matched,'' Reagan said.
   ``I once said that he is a great vice president, but I know and
I've seen that it didn't come easily. George Bush is a man of
action _ a man accustomed to command,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said he was comfortable with the idea of passing on the
mantle of chief executive to Bush.
   ``I have seen him keep a cool head in hot crises. I have seen
his leadership and vision. I have given him some of the most
sensitive and difficult tasks we've had, and he has never let me or
the country down,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan lambasted the Democratic ticket as ``a three-headed
ticket that doesn't know left from center,'' an apparent reference
to Dukakis, his running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, and Democratic
runner-up Jesse Jackson.
   Reagan also tried to offer a boost to Quayle's troubled
campaign, dogged by questions over his entry into the National
Guard and his relationship with a female lobbyist on a Florida
golfing trip.
   ``I'd say America has a great candidate ... and I must confess I
like his running mate, too,'' Reagan said in comments that were not
included in his prepared remarks.
   ``Dan Quayle stands for the same principles as George Bush and I
do,'' the president said.
   Reagan and Bush appeared together at the noisy pep rally after
conferring privately for about 15 minutes.
   Besides California Gov. George Deukmejian and Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., attending the rally were actor Charlton Heston, actress
Cheryl Ladd, singer Pat Boone and comedian Bob Hope, who quipped
that Quayle can ``not only be our vice president, he can be our
national bird.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top seats for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway
Dances,'' featuring dance numbers from some of Robbins' biggest
hits, will cost $55 when the $7 million musical opens early next
year, it was announced Wednesday.
   ``We are limited to one source of income in the theater _ the
box office,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert
Organization, which is co-producing the show. ``It's a question of
economics, and this is a lavish show.''
   The current top ticket price on Broadway is $50, the going rate
for such musical hits as ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les
Miserables,'' ``Cats,'' ``Me and My Girl'' and ``Into the Woods.''
   By any standards, ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway Dances,' which
begins preview performances at the Imperial Theater Jan. 16 and
officially opens Feb. 26, is a mammoth undertaking.
   Schoenfeld said the musical has a cast of 60 and is expected to
include production numbers from such Robbins' shows as ``Fiddler on
the Roof,'' ``West Side Story,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``On the Town,''
``Peter Pan,'' ``The King and I,'' and ``High Button Shoes.'' In
some of the shows, he was the choreographer and in others he was
both director and choreographer.
   Adding to the cost is the musical's unusually long rehearsal
period of 22 weeks, compared with six to eight weeks for most
musicals. ``Broadway Dances,'' which features a cast of relative
unknowns, began rehearsals Aug. 15.
   In addition, Schoenfeld said, it took Robbins six months to
research and reconstruct the dance numbers, interviewing many of
the original performers in his shows as well as watching videotapes
of the original productions.
   Schoenfeld said the show would need to gross $420,000 a week to
break even, and would need to play more than 60 weeks at capacity
to pay back its $7 million investment.
   Although the show would be the first regular Broadway production
to crack the $50-a-ticket barrier, the limited-run, eight-hour
production of ``Nicholas Nickleby'' cost $100 a ticket.

   The IRA bombed an armored
police car Wednesday and announced a sophisticated new terror
strategy to go with its summer blitz against the British army that
has killed 26 soldiers.
   Explosives packed in a parked van blew the patrolling police car
across a road at Maghera, 40 miles northwest of Belfast, slightly
injuring the two officers inside, police said.
   The incident resembled the Irish Republican Army bombing of a
military bus Saturday near Omagh, about 30 miles away, which killed
eight British soldiers and injured 27.
   It came a day after a car bomb blew up in the center of Belfast,
shattering windows and possibly signalling a return by the IRA to
the ``commercial war'' of the 1970s that devastated the city center.
   A telephoned warning enabled police to evacuate the area, and
the only casualty of the 400-pound bomb was a pregnant woman who
suffered minor injuries, police said.
   Police said gunmen burst into a children's birthday party in
Roman Catholic west Belfast on Tuesday, held five adults and four
children, and stole the family van for use as a car bomb. It said
the captives were released unharmed after the bomb exploded at
Maghera.
   Police said they were questioning several people arrested in the
Maghera-Omagh area about ``serious terrorist crimes.''
   In Belfast, dozens of homes were evacuated while police checked
two other suspected car bombs that turned out to be harmless.
   The British government claims the regime of Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi has given the IRA high-quality arms, anti-aircraft
missiles and Czech-made explosives.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King flew to London to discuss
anti-IRA strategy with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. King told
NBC News: ``The injection by Col. Gadhafi of more powerful
explosives and additional weapons may have given some people the
idea that somehow violence can actually win.''
   Following the two-hour meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, King said
some matters that had been resolved ``will become apparent shortly
in various ways.''
   He declined to give further details and said more meetings with
the prime minister were planned because other unspecified issues
``will require further detailed work.''
   King said the government faced ``a serious, vicious terrorist
challenge'' which would be met.
   In statements issued through the legal Republican Press Center
in Belfast, the outlawed IRA said Tuesday's car bomb was aimed at
the Windsor House office block.
   It also announced a new strategy for bombing ``commercial and
administrative property'' at minimal risk to civilians. In future
car bombings, a smoke grenade would go off, simultaneously warning
bystanders and sensitizing the bomb to any attempt to defuse it,
the group said.
   A renewed bombing campaign in central Belfast would be a blow to
rejuvenating its commercial and entertainment heart, which the
government sees as crucial to returning life to normal.
   Late-night shopping has played a major role in stimulating
business confidence, proving so popular among violence-weary
Belfast residents that the law has been changed to allow two
late-night shopping days a week instead of one.
   The government faces demands to crack down harder on the IRA,
following a series of attacks on British soldiers in Northern
Ireland, mainland Britain and continental Europe this summer.
   The most recent was a bomb Monday that killed a navy officer as
he was driving into Belfast.
   Among measures being proposed are locking up suspects without
trial, changing the law to deny suspects the right to remain silent
and outlawing the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein.
   Except for changing special license plates on the cars of
British soldiers in Europe to make them less identifiable, Mrs.
Thatcher and King have refused to disclose what measures might be
taken, saying they don't want to tip the IRA.
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said: ``Attempting to defeat the
IRA is not a viable or sensible option despite Thatcher and King's
bravado.''
   In a statement, he said: ``The British people need to ask if
there is not another way. They need to ask why the question of
their government's immoral claim to a part of Ireland is constantly
being forcibly rejected by the IRA which their government claims to
have defeated.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to rid Northern Ireland,
with its Protestant majority, of British rule and unite the
province with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.

   The State Department said it was ``shocked''
Wednesday at Israel's planned deportation of 25 Palestinian Arabs,
and sources said the administration would not lend its usual
support to Israel if the issue arises in the United Nations.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley complained that the
deportation move``appears to make expulsion the norm rather than
the exception.''
   ``We are shocked by the government of Israel's decision,'' Mrs.
Oakley said. She stressed the numbers involved distressed the U.S.
government most.
   ``As a strong friend of Israel we are deeply concerned over the
widening use of expulusions,'' she said.
   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press, meanwhile, that
the United States notified Israel it would be obliged to take this
position in conflict with Israel's if the deportation issue reached
the United Nations.
   The two governments have differed only infrequently before the
world body, where U.S. support for Israel has often rescued Israel
from condemnation over various policies and actions.
   But the sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
the United States had informed Israel the dispute was harmful to
U.S.-Israeli relations.
   Mrs. Oakley said she was not ``speculating on the strength of
what we all consider to be a very strong relationship.''
   The U.S. spokesman added: ``Our friendship and close association
with Israel continues. But what we are saying is that this is an
issue of concern and we've expressed these concerns to the
government of Israel.''
   Mrs. Oakley said enforcement of the expulsion orders would mean
a total of 60 Palestinian Arabs were deported this year.
   The statement did not specifically condemn all expulsions or
question Israel's attempt to maintain order on the West Bank and in
Gaza in the face of rising unrest among the 1.5 million Palestinian
inhabitants.
   However, the State Department on several occasions has publicly
urged Israel not to use expulsions as a punishment for criminal
acts but rather to apply the regular process of charging and trying
suspects based on evidence.
   The last such U.S. statement was made by Mrs. Oakley last Friday
even as Israel was in the midst of moving against the Palestinians.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead on Monday summoned
Deputy Israeli Ambassador Oded Eran to the State Department to
convey U.S. unhappiness with the deportations.
   Yossi Gal, the Israeli embassy spokesman, defended the policy on
Tuesday as a ``measure of last resort'' in dealing with agitation.
   He said the expulsions were carried out ``in conformity with the
law of the land and subject to review by the Israeli high court.''
   The Israeli spokesman said the purpose was ``to try to ensure
public safety'' and that expulsions were ordered ``only when we are
convinced it is the best way to handle the instigators and
inciters'' of violence in the territories.
   Despite the disagreement, Gal said on Wednesday there was ``no
crisis'' in U.S.-Israeli relations.
   At least 252 Palestinian Arabs and 4 Israeli have died in the
disorders that broke out last December. Meanwhile, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz has made four trips to the region this year
to try to promote Arab-Israeli negotiations over the Palestinians.
   His missions foundered over Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian
resistance to hold talks on a Middle East settlement under the
terms proposed by the United States.
   With Shultz on vacation, Whitehead is in charge of the State
Department. In his session with Eran, he ``was speaking for the
U.S. government as he does in any situation like this,'' Mrs.
Oakley said.

   Michael Dukakis tucked away the
endorsement of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday and promised strong
business-labor relations backed by a president who is ``an economic
leader, not a cheerleader.''
   Dukakis, in speeches to the labor group in Washington and a
college audience in Michigan, said that more Americans are working
now than ever before. But he said the new jobs created during the
Reagan administration have been low paying and average family
income stands where it was 20 years ago.
   ``That's the price our workers and their familes are paying for
voodoo economics,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said,
resurrecting a line George Bush used against Ronald Reagan in 1980.
   ``I have met too many young people who have accepted jobs over
the last eight years that pay less than their old jobs,'' Dukakis
said in a speech at Grand Valley State University. ``I have met too
many couples who are working harder at two jobs just to stay in
place.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee criticized Bush's promise to
create 30 million new jobs if elected to two terms as president, a
pledge senior Bush ecomonic advisers have conceded may be overly
optimistic.
   ``This election is not about whether Mr. Bush's own economists
believe his speeches,'' Dukakis said. ``It is about making every
American a full shareholder in the American dream. It's about
creating jobs with a future, jobs you can count on, jobs you can
raise a family on.''
   It was the second consecutive day Dukakis has directly
criticized Bush. On Tuesday, Dukakis noted that Bush has no
experience as a chief executive and also said the vice president
was unfit for the presidency if he would sign a law mandating
recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools even if advised
that it was unconstitutional.
   In Washington, Dukakis chastised the vice president for not
mentioning the trade and budget deficits in his speech to the
Republican convention.
   ``And to add insult to injury, he wants to cut taxes for the
wealthy again,'' Dukakis said. ``My friends, if this were a movie,
we'd call it `son of voodoo.'''
   Dukakis also said Bush had failed when sent to Japan by Reagan
in 1983 to improve trade relations. He also criticized both Reagan
and Bush for suddenly supporting the trade bill signed by the
president Tuesday.
   ``Trade is an issue which requires presidential leadership each
day _ not just 77 days before a presidential election,'' Dukakis
said. ``In 1983, Mr. Bush was put in charge of managing our trade
problems with Japan, when the trade deficit with Japan was $22
billion. After visiting Japan and meeting with Japanese government
officials, he came home, declaring U.S.-Japanese trade relations
were `superb.' Since then, our trade deficit with Japan has
tripled.''
   He also touched on several fronts important to labor, promising
to help foster improved management-labor relations and to
strengthen the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Trade
Commission and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   ``We want to be able to say that there's a new spirit of
determination in America, a new economic patriotism that brings us
together as one people, one nation, helping us to compete _ and win
_ in the world market,'' Dukakis said.
   ``My friends, the next president of the Unites States must be an
economic leader, not a cheerleader,'' he said. ``He must do more
than talk about creating more jobs, he must be a president who
knows how to build a strong economy _ and has done it. A president
who knows how to create and save jobs _ and has done it. A
president who has the strength and the vision and the values to
build a strong economy and a vibrant future for America.''

<HEAD>Pollsters: Quayle Controversy May Limit Bush's Bounce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's boost from the Republican National
Convention shows signs of decaying as quickly as it arose, a victim
of the controversy surrounding running mate Dan Quayle, pollsters
said Wednesday.
   Bush rebounded to at best a narrow lead in public opinion polls
this week after badly trailing the Democratic nominee, Michael
Dukakis, last month. But new polls indicate that Bush's bounce may
have peaked virtually as soon as it began.
   Two polls Wednesday put Bush ahead by leads so slim they were
within the margins of error _ 44-39 in an NBC News-Wall Street
Journal poll done Saturday through Monday and 49-47 in a Harris
poll done Friday to Monday.
   ``I think he's been hurt in the long run for the race,'' said
Michael Traugott, a Gallup Organization pollster. ``As this
reporting takes hold, there has to be some negative consequence for
the Bush-Quayle ticket.''
   News reports since the GOP convention last week have been
dominated by questions about Quayle's entry into the National Guard
during the Vietnam war and about a former female lobbyist's claim
he propositioned her in 1980.
   Those issues arose at a critical time in the campaign, when Bush
needed to capitalize on the positive response to his acceptance
speech by keeping attention focused on his themes, pollsters said.
   ``If you hit a high note you've got to keep hitting it, because
the public isn't paying attention and it needs to have that
constantly reinforced,'' said Keating Holland, a CBS News pollster.
``The good news that Bush is trying to continue to pump out is
getting lost in this Quayle thing.''
   The result: In a Gallup poll conducted Thursday and Friday, Bush
led Dukakis by nine percentage points. But in a Gallup poll done
Friday through Sunday, he led by just four points, a dead heat
because of the margin of error.
   Similarly, Bush led by six points, also within the error margin,
in a CBS News poll conducted Friday through Sunday. Holland noted
that Bush's support was strongest Friday and seemed to wane as the
weekend progressed.
   It was expected that Bush would receive a boost in popularity as
a result of television coverage of the Republican convention, just
as Dukakis won a bounce from the Democratic convention in mid-July.
The partisan speechmaking and careful choreography of modern
conventions reliably lift their nominees in the polls, albeit
temporarily.
   But Quayle questions arose even before the convention closed.
Traugott likened the effect to the 1976 debate in which President
Ford contended that Eastern Europe is not under Soviet domination;
initial polls found no effect, but Ford soon suffered as news
reports stressed the gaffe.
   ``This will turn out to be one of those events, like the 1976
debate, that will be cited as a major explanatory factor for either
a narrow (Bush) loss or a victory which could have been bigger,
given the boost that he should have received from the Reagan
performance of the past eight years,'' Traugott said. ``It will
become part of the folklore of the 1988 election.''
   While Ford's misstatement reflected on himself, pollsters
doubted that concerns about Quayle personally were harming the GOP
ticket, because voters tend to decide exclusively on the
presidential nominees.
   ``People repeatedly say the vice presidential choice doesn't
matter,'' said Jeff Alderman, pollster for ABC News. ``If the vice
presidential candidate can't help very much, then it's equally
difficult for him to hurt very much.''
   Instead, others said, the apparent damage stems from a lack of
positive publicity for the Bush campaign coming out of the
convention. With voters somewhat unfamiliar with the nominees and
not strongly committed to either one, negative developments _ such
as the Quayle questions _ can strongly influence the electorate, at
least briefly, they said.
   That is not to say polls now can predict the election's outcome.
Measures of underlying public attitudes for months have indicated a
close contest, even as Dukakis rose to an 18-point lead on the tide
of publicity from his convention. Dukakis' bounce was greater and
lasted longer than Bush's, but some polls put the race back at a
tie even before the Republicans met.
   ``Bounce is not momentum. Momentum implies you're going to
continue on indefinitely,'' Holland said. ``Bounce means you're
going to rise, you're going to fall. And the fall can be as quick
as the rise is.''
   The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among
1,762 registered voters, the Harris poll Friday through Monday
among 1,310 likely voters. Both had error margins of plus or minus
three points.

   A spokesman for Kurdish rebels said
Wednesday that Iraqi troops were massing for an all-out offensive
against the guerrillas, who are supported by Iran.
   Western diplomats in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday the Iraqis were taking
advantage of a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war with Iran to step
up operations against the rebels.
   ``A bloody massacre is awaiting the 150,000 civilians trapped in
the area,'' the spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party said in
a telephone call from a Western European city he did not identify.
   ``We believe the Iraqi authorities will use chemical weapons.
This is a matter of life and death for us.''
   The Iraqis were planning large-scale operations ``in all the
Kurdish liberated zones'' along the entire 220-mile border with
Turkey, the rebel spokesman told The Associated Press in the
telephone call to Nicosia. He spoke on condition his name not be
used because of ``security reasons.''
   He said many Iraqi army troops were gathering in the northern
cities in Mosul, Dahok and Zakho and predicted fierce fighting in
northeastern Iraq when the offensive is launched, but he did not
say when that might happen.
   About 20 million Kurds are spread across the mountainous region
where the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria and the Soviet Union
meet. Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting for a separate
homeland for more than 50 years.
   The Kurdish Democratic Party and other Kurdish factions, backed
by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, escalated their war against
Baghdad two years ago. Their attacks created a second war front in
northern Iraq, pinning down tens of thousands of Iraqi troops badly
needed in the main battlefields farther south.
   But in recent months the Iraqi army has pushed the Iranians out
of their footholds in Iraq and intensified pressure on Tehran. The
Kurds said the Iraqis intensified their attacks on rebel forces a
week before the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran took effect Aug.
20.
   The recent Iraqi offensive, involving about 50,000 troops, has
brought about a dramatic reversal in the guerrillas' fortunes. They
now appear to be trapped between Iraq and the Turkish border to the
north.
   The Turks, who are also fighting the Kurds, have been reported
to deploy large numbers of their own troops along the frontier,
apparently in collaboration with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The rebel spokesman said the movement's leader, Massoud Barzani,
has appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross for
immediate assistance to Kurdish refugees and called on the United
Nations to protect them.
   Kurdish officials and Western diplomats in Baghdad say the
Iraqis have razed hundreds of villages in recent months and
forcibly moved about 150,000 civilians to camps in the south.
   Barzani, son of the famous Kurdish general Mustafa Barzani who
died 18 months ago, also has called on U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar and world leaders to intercede with Baghdad
to halt its ``genocide'' against the Kurds.
   He has said the Iraqis have thrust deep into the Kurdish
stronghold, using poison gas, air strikes and scorched earth
tactics. Kurdish officials list nearly 30 chemical attacks on
villages in recent months.
   Charges that Iraq has used chemical weapons, outlawed under a
1925 Geneva agreement, are difficult to confirm. However, the
United Nations has reported at least some use of chemical arms by
Iraq in the war.
   Iran claimed 4,000 Kurdish civilians were killed in the town of
Halabja when the Iraqis dropped poison gas bombs in February.
Western correspondents who visited the town, captured by
pro-Iranian forces, reported seeing the bodies of hundreds of men,
women and children.
   Kurdish alarm has deepened with the cease-fire. Iranian and
Iraqi leaders meeting in Geneva Thursday for peace talks were
expected to seek guarantees that both sides will halt support for
opposition forces.
   Moreover, the guerrillas have long been suspicious of their
Iranian ally. Both the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and current
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini tried to crush Kurdish
groups inside Iran before the war made them allies.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, reported Wednesday that Yar Ahmad Husseini, leader of an
Iraqi-backed Kurdish faction, was publicly hanged in the western
town of Bakhtaran Monday.

   An American woman cleared of terrorism
charges after being imprisoned in Peru dodged reporters upon her
arrival in Ireland Wednesday after saying she wanted to go
sightseeing and visit family here.
   Cynthia McNamara, 40, a native of Philadelphia, was the only
passenger to leave a Soviet Aeroflot flight from Lima, Peru, at
Shannon airport 128 miles west of Dublin, airline officials said.
Immigration officials said she was allowed to enter the Irish
Republic on her American passport.
   She eluded waiting reporters at Shannon by mingling with about
200 passengers from another flight and slipping out a side door.
   Ms. McNamara earlier said she would move on from Ireland to
London to meet friends and eventually hoped to find a job teaching
English somewhere in Europe.
   She was imprisoned for nearly five months in Peru on charges of
taking part in an August 1987 rebel attack in Vilcashuaman,
Ayacucho state, by the Maoist Shining Path movement. Two government
workers were killed.
   She said she was a tourist, had no ties with the rebels and had
nothing to do with the attack. Her lawyers, the U.S. Embassy in
Lima and survivors of the attack and other witnesses backed her up.
   A Lima court cleared her April 26, but she was rearrested on the
same charges Aug. 2 when she went to a police station for
permission to leave the country. She was held in jail until Monday
night, but was finally freed after an Ayacucho court ruled she
could not be tried twice for the same crime, her lawyer said.
   ``My name is cleared. I feel relieved,'' Ms. McNamara told
reporters before leaving Lima Tuesday.
   Peruvian police first arrested her on Dec. 5.

<DATELINE>MESQUITE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The press has taken a nearby hill,
christened it ``Fort Mesquite'' and settled in for a long wait _
but a friend staying with Paula Parkinson at an apartment here says
the media siege won't work.
   ``She is still here, but she doesn't want to talk to anybody,''
said a woman who identified herself only as Cori and as a niece of
Ms. Parkinson's roommate, John Gideon, who was arrested Friday
after a domestic disturbance.
   ``She's not going to say anything for a long time.''
   But Dallas area reporters and photographers and network TV crews
are keeping an unblinking eye on the second-story apartment of the
ex-lobbyist, who has become a thorn in the side of the vice
presidential nominee, Dan Quayle.
   Neighbors say the press began circling, cameras in hand, outside
Ms. Parkinson's apartment late last week, even before the Daily
News of Los Angeles reported that two former attorneys for Ms.
Parkinson quoted her as telling the FBI in 1981 that Quayle had
propositioned her on a Florida golfing holiday.
   Then Playboy magazine announced Tuesday that an article in its
November edition will include a statement about the incident from
Ms. Parkinson, who says she rebuffed Quayle's advance because she
was with another congressman, then-Rep. Tom Evans, R-Del.
   ``We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and
suggestively,'' Ms. Parkinson was quoted by Playboy. ``He said he
wanted to make love.''
   Quayle, who has denied any relationship with Mrs. Parkinson,
said Tuesday he is tiring of questions about her and his National
Guard service. ``This is getting a little bit outrageous and I'm
getting a little bit indignant about just one bum rap after
another,'' he said.
   Ms. Parkinson, who was interviewed by the FBI as part of an
investigation into whether sexual favors were being traded for
votes against legislation opposed by her employer, has refused to
come to her apartment door. She did accept a list of prepared
questions from one reporter only to send them back outside without
answering them.
   ``The residents here feel like it's an invasion of their
privacy, too,'' said an apartment manager, who refused to be
identified. ``They aren't real thrilled about having all these
cameras around.''
   Mesquite police said Gideon was arrested after a disturbance at
the apartment complex. He was being held Wednesday at the Lew
Sterrett Justice Center in Dallas in lieu of $2,000 bail on charges
of driving without a license, possession of marijuana and driving
while intoxicated. He also was being held for state prison
authorities for investigation of a possible parole violation.
   Ms. Parkinson, who changed her name back to her maiden name
Paula Laham following a 1984 divorce from Hank Parkinson, has held
a number of short-term jobs since the original Washington sex
scandal and an ensuing appearance in Playboy.
   She also has had legal problems, The Dallas Morning News
reported in its Tuesday editions. She was arrested for public
intoxication twice in 1985, with one case being dismissed and the
other probated for 90 days. Then last December, she pleaded guilty
to a charge of driving under the influence and was placed on
probation for two years, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Mountain Climbers Rescued After Reports of Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers found a mountain-climbing party
of five Frenchmen, one Canadian and two Bolivians on Wednesday, the
day after their guide reported what he described as a guerrilla
attack.
   Eduardo Perez Beltran, acting interior minister, told The
Associated Press the climbers were expected in La Paz on Thursday
and police were continuing to investigate.
   Jorge Alderete, interior undersecretary, said earlier: ``We do
not yet have a clear picture of the situation but the first
information indicates it is a group linked to the Peruvian Shining
Path guerillas.''
   Berfardo Guarachi, the Bolivian guide, said 16 heavily armed men
surrounded the climbing party's base camp Monday at about 15,000
feet in the Andes, 50 miles north of La Paz. Guarachi said he heard
shots before escaping down a glacier.
   Guarachi said Tuesday that the men communicated with
walkie-talkies and five wore khaki uniforms.
   After the climbers were found, Perez Beltran said a preliminary
investigation indicated they were surrounded by armed Indians who
may have been hunting and there was no evidence of guerrilla
involvement.
   He said military aircraft flew over the site and helicopter
pilots found the camp abandoned Tuesday, raising concern among
officials.
   Paititi, the travel agency that handled the expedition, said the
foreign climbers were experienced and the two Bolivians worked for
the agency. Guarachi is a veteran mountaineer who was the first to
reach an airliner that crashed on Illimani mountain in 1984.
   The Shining Path, a Maoist group, began fighting in the Peruvian
Andes eight years ago and the guerrilla war has cost more than
15,000 lives. No guerrilla operations have been reported in the
Bolivian Andes and no people live near the base camp.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Two Newspaper Officials Linked to Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested two officials of a leftist
newspaper the government has linked to Shining Path, the 8-year-old
Maoist guerrilla group, a lawyer and several Lima dailies said
Wednesday.
   Lawyer Alfredo Crespo said Luis Arce and Danilo Blanco, editor
and administrator respectively of El Diario, were arrested Tuesday
while seeking the release of five people detained during a raid on
a printing plant the newspaper uses. Government and police
officials refused comment.
   Arce accused police of ransacking the Imprenta Pedro Leon
printing company Friday, arresting five workers and confiscating
100,000 copies of a special El Diario edition carrying what was
presented as an interview with Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman.
   Police confirmed a raid at the time but have refused comment
since.
   Crespo, president of the Association of Democratic Lawyers, said
anti-insurgency police were holding Arce and Blanco. The government
considers Crespo's group a Shining Path front.
   Officials say El Diario is the voice of Shining Path, whose
guerrilla war has taken more than 15,000 lives and caused damage
estimated at $10 billion. Arce denies links to the guerrillas.
   His newspaper, which prints about 5,000 copies, is among the

<HEAD>Amal Militia Reports Seizing Six Spies Operating for Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shiite Moslem militia Amal said
Wednesday it had captured six members of a spy network working for
Israel and its Lebanese militia allies, and showed them to
journalists.
   The suspects were displayed at Amal headquarters in Zefta, six
miles northwest of Nabatiyeh in south Lebanon.
   The five men and a woman said they spied for Israel's Mossad
secret service and made bombing attacks on the Syrian army in west
Beirut under orders from a liaison ``espionage officer'' they
identified as a Lebanese named Assad Nasr.
   Amal, a pro-Syrian militia, did not say what it intended to do
with the prisoners.
   The suspects are Shiites who belong to the Ramadan family, but
their relationship to each other was not clear. They said they
warned the Mossad about several guerrilla operations being prepared
against Israel in south Lebanon.
   Israel maintains a ``security zone'' just north of the Lebanese
border, ranging in depth from 6 to 10 miles, with the aid of a
surrogate militia called the South Lebanon Army.
   Hasan Ali Ramadan, a Lebanese army soldier, said he had passed
on information about battalions stationed in south Lebanon since
1987.
   Another of the group, Hussein Ali Ramadan, confessed to two
bombing attacks on the Syrian army, which patrols Beirut's Moslem
sector to prevent factional warfare. Syrian soldiers have been the
targets numerous bombings since they moved into the city in
February 1987, but no group has claimed responsibility.

   Talks to bring peace, ease tensions and limit weapons are under
way throughout the world, giving rise to hope in many regions where
problems until recently seemed intractable. Here is a glance at
talks on the Iran-Iraq War, Cyprus, Angola, Korea, and the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.

<TEXT>
   IRAN-IRAQ _ Iran and Iraq are scheduled to begin peace talks
Thursday in Geneva under U.N. sponsorship.
   An Aug. 20 cease-fire was arranged under a year-old U.N.
Security Council resolution.
   These will be first talks since the Persian Gulf war began in
September 1980. Up to 1 million people have been killed, and damage
totals hundreds of billions of dollars.
   The biggest long-term problem is the border dispute, a major
cause of the war.
   Iran says the border was agreed upon in a 1975 treaty made with
Iraq by the late Shah Reza Pahlavi, overthrown in 1979 and replaced
by Ayatollah Khomeini. Iraq repudiated the treaty days before its
1980 invasion of Iran, which had followed several border skirmishes.

   CYPRUS _ Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders agreed Wednesday in
Geneva to meet Sept. 15 in Nicosia, Cyprus, for unconditional talks
to reunify their divided Mediterranean island.
   At issue is the Turkish-occupied part of the island, which
Turkey alone recognizes as independent.
   Cyprus' problems were aggravated by intercommunal clashes in
1963 that led to use of a U.N. peacekeeping force. In 1974, Turkey
invaded and occupied 37 percent of the island.
   Negotiations broke down in 1985 over demands of withdrawal of
30,000 Turkish troops from north Cyprus.
   Outstanding issues involve the powers of any central government
on the island and repatriation of refugees.

   ANGOLA _ U.S. negotiators held separate sessions in Brazzaville,
Congo with South African, Cuban and Angolan officials Wednesday in
advance of talks to determine a timetable for withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops from Angola.
   In Luanda, the Angolan capital, President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos said the possibility of peace in Angola has never been
greater since rebels began fighting the Portuguese for independence
in 1961.
   Cuban troops support the Angolan government in fighting U.S.-and
South African-backed UNITA rebels. The civil war has been going on
since Angola won independence in 1975.
   UNITA and its leader, Jonas Savimbi, are not involved in the
talks. The Marxist government of Angola refuses to negotiate with
the rebels, who say they won't adhere to the cease-fire signed
Monday by South Africa, Angola and Cuba.

   KOREA _ North and South Korean officials said Thursday they were
willing to resume talks this week on sharing next month's Olympic
Games and on developing a non-aggression pact.
   Seoul officials say North Korea is trying to distract world
attention from the Olympics, set for Sept. 17-Oct. 2. North Korea
says it wants to co-host the Games, but Olympic officials say the
Games belong to a single city.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was
divided at the end of World War II.
   Preliminary talks broke up on Monday over agenda and
participants. North Korea insists talks include legislatures of
both sides, a total of nearly 1,000 people. South Korea wants
delegations to total 30 per side.
   North Korea also wants withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops in South
Korea and removal of any nuclear weapons.

   ABM TREATY _ A U.S.-Soviet conference to review the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty opened Wednesday in Geneva with both
sides linking progress on separate nuclear arms talks to compliance
with the ABM accord.
   The first full meeting of delegations was scheduled for Thursday.
   United States claims Soviet radar under construction in Siberia
violates the treaty. Washington also says Soviet deployment last
year of two radar systems near Kiev is a violation.
   The Soviets link progress in long-range weapons reduction talks
to limits on the Reagan administration's ``Star Wars'' anti-missile
defense system. Moscow says that plan violates the ABM treaty.

   Backers of bringing the 1994 Winter Olympics to Alaska's largest
city said Wednesday that voters boosted their effort, while
Oklahoma Democrats rallied behind a first-time candidate who won a
crowded race to oppose a first-term Republican congressman.
   In Anchorage, Alaska, voters agreed by a 2-to-1 margin Tuesday
to assume financial responsibility for the Games. Alaska voters
also narrowed the field for Alaska's sole seat in the U.S. House,
and all five Oklahoma congressmen who faced challengers in
Tuesday's primary won renomination.
   The Anchorage vote gives the city a good lobbying position when
it goes before the International Olympic Committee next month in
Seoul, said Rick Nerland, executive vice president of the Anchorage
Organizing Committee.
   ``I think the numbers that we're seeing now are impressive
numbers to the IOC,'' Nerland said.
   The ballot question asked whether the municipality should cover
any unanticipated debts incurred by staging the Games.
   With 79 of 91 precincts reported Wednesday, the vote was 26,365
in favor and 13,878 against, or 66 percent to 34 percent.
   The Anchorage organizers had said they needed a clear majority
to impress the IOC, though they are not sure how much weight the
vote will carry in the international competition.
   The nine-member IOC is to choose in September between Anchorage;
Lillehammer, Norway; Ostersund-Are, Sweden; and Sofia, Bulgaria.
   In Alaska's House primary, eight-term Republican Don Young and
Democrat Peter Gruenstein, making his first try for a statewide
office, advance to the general election.
   Young handily defeated Republican challenger George Johnston, an
Arco Alaska employee from Anchorage. With 94 percent of the votes
counted Wednesday, Young had 50,958 votes, or 55.2 percent, to
Johnston's 4,977 votes, 5.3 percent.
   Gruenstein drew 32,375 votes, or 35 percent, to pull ahead of
two Democratic contenders. Eugene Vick of Juneau got 2,474 votes,
2.6 percent. Ryal White of Anchorage had 1,503 votes, 1.6 percent
of the total.
   In Oklahoma, freshman Rep. Jim Inhofe faced no Republican
challengers Tuesday, but this fall faces Kurt Glassco, a Tulsa
lawyer making his first run for political office. Glassco, a
one-time aide to former Gov. George Nigh, won the Democratic
nomination Tuesday with 60 percent of the vote despite a crowded
field that included four other candidates.
   ``Jim Inhofe is going to have his hands full'' with Glassco,
predicted Barry Moore, an aide at the Democrat's state headquarters
in Oklahoma City.
   Democrats say Inhofe, a first-term congressman, has been
ineffective in representing his district, but Republicans expressed
confidence Inhofe would prevail.
   ``It may be close, it may be a blowout,'' said Larry Stein, a
spokesman for the Republican Party in Oklahoma City, adding that
``Jim Inhofe has built a very conservative record up there.''
   Republicans also are touting Mike Brown, a lawyer making his
first run for political office, in the fall race against Democratic
Rep. Glenn English, who got 84 percent of the vote Tuesday over one
rival. Stein said Brown would campaign on economic issues such as
jobs.
   Rep. Mike Synar surprised some observers by winning 69 percent
of the vote in the Democratic primary against state Sen. Frank
Shurden, who had labeled him too liberal. Synar will face political
newcomer Ira Phillips, a former economic development specialist for
the Cherokee Nation who garnered 55 percent of the vote in the GOP
primary.
   Republican Rep. Mickey Edwards easily won renomination, and
faces Democratic political newcomer Terry Montgomery. Rep. David
McCurdy has no Republican opposition in November and Rep. Wes
Watkins faced no opposition in either the Democratic primary or the
general election.

<TEXT>
   The mayor of an Israeli town
where arsonists killed three Palestinians apologized to a victim's
family Wednesday in an attempt to patch up strained Arab-Jewish
relations.
   ``What happened really shocked me,'' Yitzhak Bukovza, mayor of
Or Yehuda near Tel Aviv, told relatives of Mustafa Khalil Abadlah
during a visit to their home in this central Gaza Strip town.
   ``It's a (religious) commandment to bring the spirit of peace
and express our will to live together,'' Bukovza said.
   Abadlah's three brothers listened with tears in their eyes and
accepted the mayor's apology. But they also demanded harsh
punishment for the arsonists and better protection for Arab workers
in Israel.
   Three Palestinians laborers sleeping in a construction site
shack in Or Yehuda were killed when assailants set the hut on fire
Aug. 8. Three Or Yehuda residents are being held in the attack.
   Police said the assailants were not out to attack Arabs, but to
take revenge on a Jewish contractor who refused to give them work.
   Earlier this week, police detained four Arabs suspected of
hurling smoke bombs and firebombs at an Or Yehuda home to avenge
the arson.
   However, Israel television reported Wednesday that police
detained two Or Yehuda residents, ages 20 and 30, on suspicion of
carrying out the attack for which the four Arabs were held. The
report said one of the suspects lives in the apartment building
where the bombs were thrown.
   Their aim was to provoke neighbors to expel Palestinians from
the town, the television said.
   Several Or Yehuda residents welcomed the arson attack. ``So what
if an Arab burned to death?'' Shuki Calif, 16, told the Hadashot
newspaper. ``What's an Arab anyway. He isn't human.''
   In his visit to Qarara, Bukovza defended city residents, saying:
``Those who are under suspicion are Or Yehuda residents, but we can
say with a clear conscience that our boys were not involved in
this.'' He did not elaborate.
   Bukovza was accompanied by a dozen city residents during the
trip. The delegation's bus was guarded by two army jeeps and
followed by about two dozen journalists.
   When the group arrived at the four-story home of the Abadlah
family, mayhem broke loose as camera crews and photographers pushed
for positions, leaving the relatives bewildered and intimidated.
   The meeting was awkward at first. The victim's three brothers
were seated in chairs, and Bukovza delivered his statement standing
in front of them, until a village leader pointed out that it would
be more appropriate for him to be seated as well.
   One of the brothers, Abdel Razik Abadlah, said after the
meeting: ``I'm very thankful that this important man came to see
us. I'm very happy that he apologized to us.''
   However, Abadlah said he would no longer work in Israel because
``if I go, I will get killed.'' He said he has worked as a
construction worker in the Tel Aviv area for 10 years.
   The family demanded a thorough investigation, better protection
for Arab workers and compensation from Or Yehuda.
   Bukovza, speaking in Hebrew and halting Arabic, invited the
family to Or Yehuda at the end of the 40-day period of mourning and
promised compensation.
   When asked for immediate assistance, Bukovza said he and others
would pay ``a symbolic sum'' until a deal was worked out.
   Initially the mayor, whose parents were born in Libya, also
planned to pay condolences to the families of the other two
victims. It was not clear why they did not attend the meeting.
   The Or Yehuda arson was one in a recent series of violent
confrontations between Arabs and Jews inside Israel.

<HEAD>Cold Front Triggers Thunderstorms Across South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wide band of showers and strong thunderstorms with locally
heavy rain stretched from central Texas to southwest South Carolina
Wednesday, and cool showers also doused much of the Northeast.
   A cold front curving south from the Great Lakes through
southwest Virginia, northern Louisiana and central Texas mixed with
warm, moist air and generated storms through much of the South.
   Some of the heaviest rain hit Louisiana, with Alexandria getting
over 1} inches and Shreveport up to 1{ inches.
   In the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT, New Bern, N.C., received
1.90 inches of rain.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across New England
and western sections of New York State and Pennsylvania, and
thunderstorms were moving off the North Carolina coast.
   A few showers and thunderstorms formed over the Mojave Desert of
California and the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Heavier rain
was predicted for the afternoon and evening and a flash flood watch
was posted for the mountains and deserts of southern California.
   Widely scattered showers also developed over the mountains of
New Mexico and Colorado, and over southwest Washington.
   Hot, humid air continued its grip on much of Texas. Galveston
set a record high for the date of 95 degrees, surpassing a
94-degree mark set in 1935. Austin and Corpus Christi tied records
with readings of 102 and 98, respectively.
   Smoke from several forest fires in northwest Wyoming was
spreading southeastward across that state and into western Nebraska
and was expected to cause very red sunsets and sunrises over parts
of Wyoming and the central Plains for the next day or two.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 55 degrees at Concord,
Keene Laconia and Lebanon, N.H., to 104 degrees at Beeville, Tex.
The overnight low was 31 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Thursday's forecast called for scattered showers from Michigan
to New York and New England, with the heaviest rain in northern
Michigan and northern New England. Showers and thunderstorms also
were expected along the Gulf Coast and Florida and much of the
southern Plateau.
   Highs were expected to remain cool in the 60s in northern
Michigan and northern New England; in the 70s from North Dakota
through the Great Lakes to southern New England; and between 100
and 105 degrees over the desert Southwest and the central valleys
of California. Highs elsewhere were forecast to be in the 80s and
90s.

<HEAD>3,000 Residents Evacuated After Fire In PCB Depot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three thousand people driven from their homes by
a fire at a PCB depot in suburban Montreal waited with friends and
relatives late Wednesday while scientists conducted water and soil
tests for contamination.
   Many evacuated residents complained they were being kept in the
dark about the possible dangers of inhaling PCBs, a liquid chemical
suspected of causing cancer.
   ``I'm not afraid for me but for my baby,'' said Chantal Labarre,
24, eight months pregnant. ``We all have questions and wonder what
the danger is.''
   Another resident, Jean-Pierre Reinesch, said: ``The firemen were
told to burn their clothes. What about us?''
   Environment Minister Tom MacMillan promised a thorough
investigation into the cause of the six-hour inferno in St.
Basile-le-Grand, 15 miles east of Montreal. The blaze sent flames
more than 150 feet into the night sky on Tuesday and covered the
area with a thick black cloud.
   More than 50 residents were treated for skin and lung irritation
at local hospitals, Alain Lavoie, an official of the Quebec
Environment Ministry, told The Associated Press.
   Police sealed off the area as federal and provincial scientists
conducted soil and water tests. Doctors checked residents of a
5{-square-mile area.
   Production of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) now is banned,
but it was formerly used as a coolant in hydroelectric
transformers. PCBs inhibit electrical flow and won't burn at
temperatures under 1,832 degrees.
   The depot stored drums containing thousands of gallons of
discarded oil with PCBs.
   Environment official Antonio Flammand said some test results may
not be available for weeks. Until then, it is impossible to predict
the long-term effects of inhaling the fumes.
   ``There's a possibility that animals (near the scene) and
firemen who were exposed may suffer long-term effects,'' said
Flammand.
   Residents in St. Basile and neighboring sections of East
Montreal were advised not to eat fruit or vegetables from their
gardens, or drink tap water. In nearby Ste-Julie, people were
warned to keep windows closed, and keep children and pets inside.
   The privately owned warehouse, roughly the size of a hockey rink
with steel outer walls and a cement floor, has been a topic of
controversy, with residents pressing for better safety. The Quebec
government found seven safety violations two years ago but
improvements reportedly remained to be carried out.
   ``It's a scandal that it's still there,'' said resident Renee
Archambault. ``It takes a disaster like this before people wake
up.''
   The only plant in Canada capable of destroying PCBs is in Swan
Hills, Alberta, but does not accept PCB waste from other provinces.
St. Basile is one of 50 storage sites in Quebec alone.
   ``It was a bomb waiting to go off,'' said resident Kane Fleming.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry on Wednesday said
the U.S. Army can station 39 more attack helicopters in central
Hesse state, despite objections by local officials that the skies
are already too crowded.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz found no grounds for refusing the
U.S. request to base the helicopters at a U.S. air field near
Wiesbaden in September, the ministry said in a statement.
   Earlier this month, the Hesse state parliament told the Defense
Ministry it objected to more helicopters being based near
Wiesbaden, saying air traffic was overcrowded near Frankfurt's
international airport.
   Wiesbaden is 25 miles west of Frankfurt.
   However, the Defense Ministry said that after careful study
Scholz decided the advantages of the helicopters in boosting the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's security and defense of West
Germany outweighed objections to the stationing.
   But the statement said the decision was limited to the basing
only of the 39 additional attack helicopters and does not include
the U.S. military's plans to expand to 181 total aircraft at the
air base by 1993.
   There are currently 57 U.S. military helicopters based at the
Wiesbaden site.
   The U.S. Army released a statement late Wednesday which said the
ministry's decision ``confirmed the planned stationing is within
the scope of international agreements governing the use of
Wiesbaden air base by U.S. forces.''

<HEAD>Judge Rejects PTL Reorganization Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge rejected the
proposed PTL reorganization plan Wednesday, saying it did not take
into account the television ministry's poor financial health.
   ``This plan does not work,'' Judge Rufus Reynolds said. ``It
does not reflect the situation.''
   Reynolds gave bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton until Oct.
1 to prepare a new plan, and until Sept. 10 to return with
information on potential buyers for the ministry's assets.
   Reynolds considered but rejected the idea of closing operations
down, saying that would kill PTL's source of revenues, which
include donations from television viewers and proceeds from the
Heritage USA Christian retreat near Fort Mill.
   The ministry, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987
after the resignation of founder Jim Bakker in a sex-and-money
scandal, has been divided into the newly named Heritage Ministries
and a corporation holding PTL's assets.
   The rejected reorganization plan would have given the trustee up
to five years to sell assets and repay PTL's debts, which could be
more than $130 million.
   After the 75-minute hearing, Benton said he would propose to
sell the assets over a shorter period of six to seven months to
satisfy PTL's creditors and the court.
   Benton did not say whether the rejection of the reorganization
plan would affect a proposal by Samoth Capital Corp., owned by
Canadian businessman Peter Thomas, to buy PTL's satellite
television network, the Heritage USA property and 1,700 acres of
undeveloped property. Samoth has offered $113 million, but the
money would be paid over several years.
   Benton said solidifying a sale within the next six to seven
months would let creditors know exactly how much they would receive
much sooner than the five years allowed in the rejected
reorganization plan.
   Benton said he expected to have a firm offer from Samoth by
Sept. 1, and possibly competing offers from Bakker; Charlotte,
N.C., businessman George Shinn, who owns an NBA expansion franchise
in that city, and an Oklahoma group he declined to name.
   Both Reynolds and Benton said any potential buyer would need to
maintain a ministry on the property to support operations.
   Reynolds also agreed to transfer $885,000 in proceeds from other
assets sales to the corporation holding the ministry's assets.
Benton said the corporation has been losing $400,000 a month.
   Reynolds did not act on a request for funds for Heritage
Ministries, which Benton said was already some $400,000 in debt.
   Afterwards, Heritage Village Church Pastor Sam Johnson blamed
the shortfall on legal expenses and the ministry's television
program having to go through a name change.
   He said he would once again appeal to ministry supporters for
help and should know by the end of September the ministry's future.
   ``If they respond we'll have a ministry. If they don't it will
be shut down,'' he said.

   Premier Noburo Takeshita of Japan comes to
Beijing Thursday on a six-day visit to point up recent improvements
in Chinese-Japanese ties and offer new financial aid to reaffirm
Japan's role in China's future.
   It is the 64-year-old Japanese leader's first visit to China
since taking office last November.
   Premier Li Peng will welcome Takeshita in a ceremony outside the
Great Hall of the People. The two will hold talks expected to focus
on economic issues.
   Takeshita is to meet separately with senior leader Deng
Xiaoping; President Yang Shangkun, and the Communist Party general
secretary, Zhao Ziyang, before leaving Beijing on Saturday for
other areas of China.
   His visit comes at a relatively trouble-free moment in the
often-stormy relations between the two Asian neighbors. Officials
from both sides agree the talks will be upbeat.
   The official news agency Xinhua said the visit ``will be a major
event of far-reaching significance in the political life of the
Chinese and Japanese people.''
   On Wednesday the national television evening news, in a rare
profile of a visiting dignitary, gave a lengthy account of
Takeshita's life.
   Takeshita is to highlight the visit by announcing a new package
of low-interest loans, estimated at $6 billion for Chinese
development projects in the 1990-95 period.
   He is also to sign an investment protection accord reached after
seven years of sometimes acrimonious negotiations that will give
Japanese investors the same tax and other benefits accorded to
Chinese enterprises.

   The death of more than 7,000 seals in the heavily
polluted North Sea indicates major problems in all the world's
oceans and is a warning to humans living around them, British
scientists said Wednesday.
   No link has been established between pollution and the virus
leading to the severe pneumonia that is killing the seals, but
dumped chemicals may be destroying their immune system so they
cannot fight disease, said scientists of the British government's
Natural Environment Research Council.
   ``Whatever is causing the problem in the North Sea could spread
to affect all the world's oceans,'' said Dr. Brian McCartney,
director of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory monitoring the
North Sea.
   ``Pollution is higher in the North Sea than in the Atlantic
Ocean, but the two seas are connected and the state of the North
Sea is an early indicator of the state of all the oceans,'' he told
a news conference.
   ``Seals are prone to infection, but we have seen nothing like
this before,'' said Dr. John Harwood, head of the government-funded
Sea Mammal Research Unit at Cambridge.
   ``We feel powerless as there is almost nothing we can do to stop
the seals dying,'' he said.
   The British government announced it would fund new research to
discover how and where seals pick up harmful pollutants in the sea.
   Junior Environment Minister Virginia Bottomley said the
government was concerned about the death of seals because disease
could reach Britain from the eastern North Sea and the Baltic Sea.
   The research involves taking samples of blood and tissue from
seals and fitting some of the animals with radio transmitters so
ships can track their feeding movements. A report should be ready
within six months, Mrs. Bottomley said.
   The scientists said a group of highly toxic compounds called
PCBs _ polychlorinated biphenols _ used in electrical equipment
like transformers are among the prime suspect chemicals.
   ``Seals represent the highest mammals in the North Sea and are
the closest to man physiologically, so when they die in thousands
it is a warning to man,'' McCartney said in an interview.
   Harwood said half the population of common seals in northwest
Europe has died from the virus on the coasts of Denmark, West
Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Britain.
   He said Britain's 200,000 gray seals might be threatened. These
seals account for half the world population of gray seals and still
are not known to be affected by the virus.
   Only 500 to 1,000 monk seals survive in the eastern Aegean Sea
of the Mediterranean and the west African coast of Mauritania.
These seals ``could be in terrible danger if the disease spreads,''
and the disease could also spread to dolphins and porpoises, he
said.
   Harwood said Dutch scientists isolated two viruses in dead
seals, one a type of herpes and the other a type of picorna, which
causes polio and hoof and mouth disease in livestock.
   Dr. Minnie Courtney, an independent marine biologist of London
University, said: ``We know nothing of immunity in seals or fish,
only in man. We are in a very weak position when something like
this happens. It's as if you had to start studying medicine for
human beings all over again.''
   Sir Richard Body, a Conservative lawmaker, called for urgent
government action to stop North Sea pollution because Britain was
``pouring more filth'' into it than any other nation.
   Opposition Labor Party lawmaker David Blunkett said, ``It is
time for Britain to act, to prevent the North Sea becoming the Dead
Sea and to work with the Dutch and the Scandinavians in saving what
seals we can.''

<HEAD>Conference Adopts Plan of Action For African Refugee Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conference sponsored by the United Nations
and the Organization of African Unity adopted a plan Wednesday to
help ease the plight of 5.4 million refugees in southern Africa. It
asked for intensified world aid.
   The Oslo Declaration and Plan of Action said relief efforts
should concentrate on rebuilding agriculture, finding jobs for
displaced people and providing them access to credit and marketing
structures.
   The three-day conference attracted more than 400 delegates from
80 countries, specialized U.N. agencies and African ``liberation
movements.''
   The plan suggested a general outline for helping refugees in
nine states bordering or near South Africa: Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
   It said greater efforts should be made to forecast and prepare
for emergencies; to assess relief needs and plan deliveries; to
help affected areas recover and develop, and to step up the
mobilization of resources.
   ``The conference recognizes that the conditions of refugees,
returnees and displaced persons is a global responsibility,'' the
declaration said, stressing the need for international
burden-sharing.
   Documents distributed at the conference estimated some of the
annual recovery costs for southern Africa as: $150 million for
agriculture, $100 million for health and education, $50 million for
housing, $50 million for roads, $40 million for emergency food
stocks, $25 million for water supplies, $20 million to deal with
soil erosion and $15 million for sanitation.
   The conference recommended more coordination among existing
organizations, particularly the High Commissioner for Refugees, the
World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Health Organization.
   The document blamed South Africa's racial policy for many of the
problems in the area, although millions of the refugees also were
displaced inside their own countries by domestic conflicts.
   ``The root causes of the tragic humanitarian crisis unfolding in
the region is South Africa's apartheid policy, its illegal
occupation of Namibia, the policies it pursues in the region of
direct and indirect acts of aggression, intimidation and
destabilization,'' the declaration said.
   ``The fundamental and lasting solutions to the region's refugee
problem lie in the adoption of political and other actions aimed at
bringing about total abolition of apartheid, racial equality,
national independence and improved economic and social conditions.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar attended the
conference opening on Monday before leaving for Iran-Iraq peace
talks in Geneva.
   Also attending were OAU chairman and Mali President Moussa
Traore; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe; Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland of Norway and Jean-Pierre Hocke, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   The conference asked that its declaration be submitted to the
next OAU and U.N. sessions for appraisal and follow-up.
   By law and custom, apartheid in South Africa establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader `Disappointed' On Robertson Response To `Temptation'
Letter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By D.W. PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   A prominent Jewish leader said
Wednesday he's ``disappointed and saddened'' at the response of Pat
Robertson to his request for a statement condemning anti-Semitic
remarks made about the film ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the New York-based
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, chastised the former
Republican presidential hopeful for failing to quickly condemn
statements made by some critics of the Martin Scorsese film, The
New York Times reported Wednesday.
   Foxman, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, said
he was sad the personal correspondence between him and Robertson
had become public in the newspaper and that he considered Robertson
to be a friend.
   But he repeated his contention that Robertson's initial response
to his letter asking the television evangelist for a condemnation
of anti-Semitism had been inadequate.
   ``I appreciated his advice,'' Foxman told the AP. ``And I
respect his judgment.
   ``But I am still disappointed and saddened. This is something
that needs no great strategy or counsel. We should be able to stand
up and say, `Anti-Semitism is wrong.'''
   Some conservative Christians, unhappy with the Universal
Pictures film, claimed it is a Jewish attack on Christianity. Lew
Wasserman, the head of MCA, Universal's parent company, is Jewish.
   Robertson criticized the film but did not join in the attacks on
Wasserman.In a statement Wednesday, he said he did eventually
condemn the anti-Jewish comments about the film on his television
show, ``The 700 Club.''
   In his first letter to Robertson, Foxman asked the evangelist to
condemn anti-Semitic rhetoric.
   In his response, Robertson said he would condemn any
anti-Semitism ``that might occur,'' and suggested the ADL join him
in criticizing the picture.
   Robertson, founder and chief executive officer of the Christian
Broadcasting Network, issued a statement Wednesday saying he too
was upset that private correspondence had been made public, and
expressed disappointment that the ADL leader had not taken his
advice to condemn the film.
   ``I was advising a dear, personal friend of what I felt was the
most effective strategy in this particular situation _ to stop
anti-Semitic rhetoric and sentiment about this film before it ever
began,'' Robertson said.
   ``Had they done what I suggested, it would have been a great
move to solidify the rapport between Christians and Jews in America
and further prompt unity between us.''
   Foxman said he believed that whether the ADL took a stand on the
film or not, Robertson should speak out on the anti-Semitism.
   ``I have seen the film, and I can understand why Christians are
upset. I think that the discussion of the portrayal of Jesus in the
film is certainly proper within the Christian community.
   ``But at the same time, the anti-Semitism is something we have
been fighting for 2,000 years. If we let these things stand
unchallenged, they become the accepted truth. It is time that those
in the middle stand up and be heard, rather than only those on both
extremes,'' Foxman said.
   In his statement, Robertson said: ``I will always stand against
anti-Semitism. I have already spoken out on `The 700 Club' on this
matter as I promised.''
   CBN spokeswoman Frankie Abourjilie said she had no details on
what Robertson had said or when he said it.

   In its first year of eligibility, cable
television's Home Box Office has become an Emmy award winner, it
was announced Wednesday.
   HBO collected two Emmy trophies _ both for ``Dear America:
Letters Home From Vietnam'' _ in the early ``area'' Emmy awards
announced by Doug Duitsman, president of the Academy of Television

an empty envelope during the Emmy telecast Sunday night, the area
awards were handed out ahead of time. It marked the first time the
awards have been handed out early.
   Cable programs have never before been eligible for Emmy Awards.
   HBO's ``Dear America'' was given an Emmy for best informational
special, and shared a trophy for best individual achievement in an
informational special with PBS' ``Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to
Follow.''
   Other winners were PBS' ``Nature'' and ``Buster Keaton'' for
best informational series; PBS' ``The Metropolitan Opera Presents:
Turandot'' for best individual achievement in classical music-dance
programming; ABC's ``The 15th Annual American Music Awards'' for
best indivdual achievement in special events programming; ABC's
``The 60th Annual Academy Awards'' for best variety-music events
programming; PBS' ``Strong Poison'' for best achievement in graphic
design and title sequences; and ABC's ``Moonlighting'' for best
achievement in special visual effects.
   Additional Emmys will be presented Saturday afternoon during a
non-televised ceremony. The major Emmys will be handed out Sunday
night during the 40th annual awards show, to be broadcast live on
the East Coast at 8 p.m. EDT by the Fox Broadcasting Co.

   Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded up to 15 Palestinians on Wednesday and their government
rejected U.S. criticism of its policy of deporting activists from
the occupied territories.
   The United States told Israel, in the first such warning, that
relations would be damaged if the Israelis continued deporting
Palestinians from the occupied lands. Deputy Secretary of State
John Whitehead delivered the warning Monday at a meeting in
Washington with an Israeli diplomat.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, troops fired on
Palestinians who hurled stones and burned tires in the alleys of
the central market, the army said.
   As soldiers and Palestinians skirmished, scores of kites flown
by children on rooftops darted in the sky. One box kite sailing
near the casbah, or old city, wore the red, white, black and green
colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag.
   A spokesman said two Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, two
by rubber bullets and two by plastic bullets. Arab hospital
officials put the number hit by gunfire at 11, including a
17-year-old girl seriously wounded in the chest.
   Four Palestinians were wounded at the Shati refugee camp in Gaza
City, the army spokesman said. Arab hospital officials said an
8-year-old boy was shot in the back.
   Israel radio said a 10-year-old Israeli boy on his way to the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba was struck in the head by a rock
as his bus passed the El Arrub refugee camp near Bethlehem.
   Palestinians began a two-day general strike Wednesday in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to protest the deaths of four
Arabs held in Israeli prisons.
   The mayor of an Israeli town where arsonists killed three
Palestinians drove to the Gaza Strip to apologize to the family of
one victim.
   At least 252 Arabs have been killed in the uprising that began
Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians who live in the occupied
lands, most of them shot by Israeli soldiers. Four Israelis also
have been slain.
   Soldiers with bulldozers demolished three homes before dawn
Wednesday in Jelazoun refugee camp. The houses belonged to members
of outlawed local committees who were suspected in the beating
death of a Palestinian youth who allegedly collaborated with
Israel, the army said.
   An Associated Press reporter in Nablus counted more than 20
instances of soldiers opening fire _ most often into the air as
warnings or with rubber or plastic bullets, which are lethal only
at close range.
   At least twice while the reporter was present, soldiers radioed
commanding officers for permission to fire live ammunition.
   Maj. Elkana, whose full name cannot be disclosed because of army
regulations, turned down a soldier who asked permission to fire a
.22 caliber rifle at the legs of protesters blocking a main road.
   Mayor Yitzhak Bukovza of Or Yehuda, near Tel Aviv, told
relatives of arson victim Mustafa Khalil Abadlah: ``What happened
really shocked me. It's a commandment to bring the spirit of peace,
and express our will to live together.''
   Abadlah was sleeping a construction site shack in Or Yehuda when
he was burned to death.
   His three brothers listened with tears in their eyes and
accepted Bukovza's apology, but demanded harsh punishment for the
arsonists and better protection for Palestinian workers in Israel.
   The Foreign Ministry, in a reply to the U.S. criticism, said
Wednesday: ``Israel does not accept the American interpretation of
international law regarding deportations. The legality ... was
checked recently by Israel's Supreme Court, which ruled that
deportations are legal, according to both Israeli and international
law.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering spent 90 minutes with Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir discussing the issue.
   Israel television later reported that both Shamir and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Pickering the deportation policy would
continue. Israel's inner Cabinet of 10 senior ministers met
Wednesday and endorsed the policy, the television said.
   Washington's criticism ``has created a small crisis, certainly
tension in the relationship,'' said Eytan Gilboa, a specialist on
the United States at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``The language
was exceptionally strong.''
   Israel has deported 33 Palestinians since the rebellion began,
contending they are leaders of resistance to Israeli rule, and has
ordered the expulsions of 25 more.
   The United States considers expulsions a violation of human
rights and an obstacle to peace in the Middle East. State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Wednesday the United
States was ``shocked'' by the decision to deport another 25
Palestinians.
   Washington has long-standing differences with Israel on
deportation, detention without trial and other punitive measures
against Palestinians, but never had indicated they threatened
relations.

   The right-wing government on Wednesday
decreed an end to all state of emergency measures for the first
time since President Augusto Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup,
the interior minister announced.
   The action was taken less than a week before Chile's military
commanders meet to nominate a candidate, expected to be Pinochet
himself, for a presidential referendum planned for October.
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, in a news conference at the
government palace, told reporters that presidential decrees
removing the emergency measures ``have been issued today and will
take effect upon publication in the official bulletin,'' within the
next few days.
   The two measures now in effect are a state of emergency and a
state of disturbance to internal peace.
   Under the state of emergency, the government is authorized to
suspend publication and broadcasts by news media and restrict
public gatherings.
   The state of disturbance measure permits Pinochet to order the
arrest and detention of opponents for up to 20 days; send into
exile citizens deemed dangerous to internal security; order
internal exile for up to three months, and restrict freedom of
information and public gatherings.
   Opposition figures reacted with cautious approval.
   ``Better late than never,'' said Alejandro Hales, head of the
national lawyers' association and a prominent critic of Pinochet.
   ``I now hope the government will not resort to any legal
loopholes to prevent Chileans from exercising rights of which they
have been deprived for 15 years,'' Hales told reporters.
   Manuel Bustos, leader of the main labor conferation, called the
government's action positive ``because it creates better conditions
for a clean referendum.''
   The president of the country's Episcopal Conference, Monsignor
Carlos Gonzalez, lauded the government action.
   ``It makes me profoundly happy,'' Gonzalez said in remarks
broadcast by Radio Cooperativo of Santiago. ``I think this will
contribute to the peace of everyone, it gives tranquility, it gives
confidence.''
   Since Sept. 11, 1973, when Pinochet led a coup that toppled the
government of elected Marxist President Salvador Allende, Chile
always has been under a state of siege, of emergency or of
disturbance of internal peace. Each has been lifted at one time or
another, but never before have all been lifted and often more than
one has been in effect at the same time.
   According to Fernandez, the new decrees were issued because
authorities had established order within the country.
   ``The efforts of the competent (government) agencies to
guarantee public calm and order have born fruit,'' he said.
``Neither the cunning aggression of extremists nor the violence
that certain groups persistently utilize has managed to compromise
the general atmosphere of order, peace and progress.''
   The Roman Catholic Church, several foreign governments including
the United States, the political opposition and even many
government supporters had called for lifting the states of
emergency before the referendum. They said the ballot would lack
credibility if civil liberties were restricted during the political
campaign.
   Pinochet, navy commander Jose Merino, air force chief Fernando
Matthei and national police director Rodolfo Stange meet Aug. 30 to
pick the presidential nominee and announce a date for the
referendum. Pinochet is virtually assured of the nomination.
   Although the precise date of the ballot has not been announced,
Pinochet has said it will take place in early October. If the
candidate wins a majority in the vote, he will begin an eight-year
term in March. If a majority rejects him, open elections will be
held in 1990, with Pinochet remaining in place until then.
   According to lawyer Gustavo Villalobos of the local Catholic
church's human rights agency, the lifting of the states of
emergency could allow most of Chile's 504 political exiles to
return. The law allows for some exiles to remain barred from
returning, he told The Associated Press in an telephone interview.

   Police converged on strikebound coal mines
and a port, activists said Thursday, after more workers joined
stoppages and Solidarity denounced official repression of the
protests.
   The government and workers are struggling for the initiative in
the biggest labor upheaval since Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed
martial law in December 1981 to crush and then outlaw Solidarity,
the first independent labor union in the Soviet bloc.
   Strikers demand higher pay, better working conditions and that
Solidarity be made legal again.
   ``We condemn and strongly protest these acts,'' Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a senior Solidarity adviser, said Wednesday of police
strike-breaking actions.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban was asked by telephone whether
the government was getting the upper hand and replied: ``There is
more and more news about strikes ended, but on the other hand there
are new centers of workers' conflicts still appearing.''
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa declared to young strikers: ``It
is you, the young people, who will renew Solidarity and renew the
country.''
   Strikes began Aug. 16 and have spread to more than 20 sites.
   A Soviet spokesman said Wednesday his government was watching
the Polish strike situation with concern, but the Kremlin has not
made an official statement.
   In Hungary, where the Soviet army crushed an uprising in 1956,
more than 300 miners struck Wednesday against bonus cuts and a new
income tax. It was the first known worker protest of stringent
economic policies introduced by Karoly Grosz, who became Communist
Party chief in May.
   In northwest Poland, helicopters circled over the strikebound
Szczecin port early Thursday, and police massed outside its
barricaded gate, said Solidarity spokesman Piotr Niemczyk.
   Police invaded a bus depot in Szczecin early Wednesday, and 150
strikers who had been holed up there for a week yielded quietly. A
strike at the Mieszko coal mine in Walbrzych ended Tuesday night in
similar fashion when police broke down the barricaded gate.
   Adam Michnik, another senior Solidarity adviser, said: ``The
situation in Silesia has become extremely serious.''
   He said workers at other coal mines in southwestern Poland may
follow the example of those at the 30 Years of Poland mine, who
have barricaded themselves in more than 1,500 feet below the
surface.
   ``Other miners are preparing to evacuate (to) underground if
there are signs of intervention,'' Michnik said.
   Polish strikers occupy their job sites instead of walking out,
as do workers in the United States and other countries.
   The official news agency PAP said strikes ended peacefully at
the Lenin, Victoria, Marcel and Borynia mines, all in the Silesia
region of southern Poland, but Niemczyk said the ``voluntary''
evacuation at Borynia occurred only after riot police threatened a
raid.
   Late Wednesday, large convoys of police vehicles headed toward
strikebound coal mines in southern Poland, said an activist in
Jastrezebie, Lycyna Wujec.
   Up to 60 vehicles were seen going toward the July Manifesto mine
in Jastrezebie, where the strikes began last week, Ms. Wujec said.
The convoy consisted of police vans, armored personnel carriers,
water cannons and ambulances, said Ms. Wujec. She said about 12
other police vans headed to the Morcinek mine.
   Witnesses said earlier about 30 police vehicles had moved in
around the July Manifesto mine.
   An army helicopter hovered and a convoy of 103 police vehicles,
including water cannon, jeeps, trucks and an armored personnel
carrier, moved through the town, according to reporters at the
scene.
   Foreign journalists were barred from the mine area for the first
time since Aug. 16.
   About 1,000 employees quit working Wednesday in two departments
at the Nowa Huta steel mill, where a strike attempt fizzled after a
few hours Monday, said Maciej Mach, a worker leader who spoke from
the plant by telephone.
   Nowa Huta, which has 30,000 employees, was the scene of a major
strike during the last labor unrest in May, but a police raid ended
it.
   Solidarity activists said strikes spread on Wednesday to the
Knurow mine in Silesia and the Dzialoszyn cement works in central
Poland, but the government did not confirm the reports. PAP said
eight mines remained on strike and Solidarity spokesmen reported 10.
   The latest Gdansk strike brought all major dock and shipyard
industries to a halt in the Baltic port.
   Employees of the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa works as an
electrician, went on strike Monday in support of the miners and of
port and transport workers in Szczecin.
   Workers at the other port and shipyard facilities in Gdansk
quickly followed, paralyzing the nation's vital export industries.
Tons of high-grade export coal remain in rail cars at the
bulk-loading terminal, which has also been idle since Monday.
   Riot troops have sealed off all strikebound operations in Gdansk.
   Walesa led rallies at three shipyards Wednesday. Some of his
comments were on a tape provided to reporters.
   Hundreds of workers, including some on the deck of a Soviet ship
undergoing repair, listened as he blamed government leaders for
bringing Poland to economic ruin.
   In an effort to quell public unrest, the government has said a
special session of a parliament commission will review economic
policy later this month.

<HEAD>Medellin Mayor Says Cocaine Gangs' War Out Of Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A war between two Colombian gangs to
control New York City's cocaine market is out of control, the mayor
of Medellin said in a report published Wednesday.
   The commander of the national police in Medellin, Col. Antonio
Sanchez, asked the federal government on Wednesday to use state of
emergency and state of siege measures to combat the violence.
   On Tuesday, Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez told a news conference,
``The only thing we can do is increase the size of the police
force.''
   Gomez said it is impossible for Medellin to control the mob war
_ ``National or international help is needed.''
   Colombian newspapers reported the news conference in Wednesday's
editions.
   One gang has headquarters in Medellin, Colombia's second largest
city, and the other in Cali, the third largest city. The two
cartels have been at war for six months for supremacy of the New
York City cocaine market, estimated by Colombian authorities to be
worth $35 billion a year.
   Eighty gang members have been killed, 62 of them belonging to
the Cali mob.
   The entire nation has been under a state of siege for all but a
few months of the last 35 years. A state of siege was imposed anew
four years ago when drug traffickers assassinated Justice Minister

   President Virgilio Barco could use the state of siege to give
search and seizure authority to the army and other government
security forces without requiring them to act on a judge's orders.
   Barco also could impose curfews and restrict the right of public

civilians in an effort to combat drug trafficking, but the Supreme
Court struck the decree down as unconstitutional.

   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed in principle to extend for one year the current deal between
the two countries for Soviet purchase of American grain, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
terms were ``essentially identical'' to current arrangements, under
which the Soviets must buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain
annually. The five-year pact expires Sept. 30.
   The official said the two sides reached a mutual decision to try
to devise a new accord but to stick to the terms now in force. He
told the Associated Press the deal was sealed last week through
``diplomatic channels.''
   A second official said he hoped a pact between the two countries
could be reached at the next negotiating session, but said that no
final agreement has been reached.
   ``We feel like we made some progress, but we're still far apart
on pricing, minimums and things of that nature,'' said Thomas Kay,
chief of the Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural
Service.
   The grain deal benefits American farmers, now experiencing
severe drought problems, and the Soviet Union, which often looks to
the West for grain even though it has had a good harvest this year.
   Last month, the Agriculture Department estimated that the
Soviets would have a bumper harvest of 215 million metric tons,
which would be their third best crop ever. The Soviets are
importing grain to build up their stockpiles and to feed expanding
livestock herds.
   The Soviets have already been given permission to purchase more
than 12 million tons of grain for this year. As of last month, they
had bought more than 5 million tons of corn, more than 9 million
tons of wheat, 830,700 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of
soybean meal.

   Residents of President Reagan's boyhood
hometown say a friendly welcome is all the pomp and circumstance
they'll need for a weeklong ``Dickson to Dixon'' goodwill visit by
a delegation from Dickson, Siberia.
   ``It will be a very laid back and relaxed visit,'' Dixon City
Clerk Barbara Graff said Wednesday. ``They're coming here in the
spirit of harmony as a sister city. They will see how we live and
exist here. We will show them the American side of life.''
   The Soviet delegation _ Dickson Mayor Nikolai T. Kardamyshev,
journalist Boris S. Ivanov and interpreter Nikolai S. Vishnewvsky
of Moscow _ arrived in Chicago for the first leg of their American
journey. They planned to continue on about 100 miles west to Dixon
later Wednesday night.
   Mayor Kardamyshev and Dixon Mayor James E. Dixon shook hands
warmly after the visitors got off the plane.
   Ivanov noted that the delegation had to wait in line for two
hours in New York before getting their passports and visas checked,
and missed an earlier flight to Chicago.
   ``It's beautiful here, but your bureaucracy is much worse than
ours,'' Ivanov said.
   But he said he was looking forward to the visit because, ``I
want to learn more about the interesting people and places here.''
   In Dixon the group will be greeted by storefront signs
proclaiming ``Peace on Earth'' in English and Russian, and flags of
the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Rather than glitz, Dixon officials hope to impress the Soviets
with a scenic Rock River setting, seven miles of petunia-lined
streets, and friendly, hard-working, peace-loving residents.
   ``I want them to feel they are experiencing Midwestern American
hospitality,'' said Mayor Dixon. ``I want them to see our people at
work. To see what we produce. Hopefully, they will get a feel for
life in small-town America.''
   The visitors will view this town of 15,700 from a boat excursion
on the Rock River, in tours of factories and farms and in meals at
the local restaurants.
   ``We're going to take them to Pizza Hut and places like Arthur's
Garden Deli for sandwiches, stuffed baked potatos and frozen
yogurt,'' Dixon said.
   But mainly, they will get a heavy dose of Reagan history.
   The first thing on their agenda Thursday is a private tour of
Reagan's boyhood home, a two-story frame house on the city's south
side. Ronald ``Dutch'' Reagan, son of a shoe salesman and a dress
maker, lived there from 1920 until he left for college in 1928.
   Born in nearby Tampico, Ill., Reagan moved to Dixon with his
family when he was 9; it was here he began to show an interest in
drama, politics and athletics.
   In Dixon, Reagan appeared in his first school play and was
elected student council president. He served as a lifeguard on the
river, where proud Dixon residents brag, he saved 77 lives in seven
years.
   ``We want to show them what kind of community impacted on
(Reagan's) personality and ultimately on his presidency,'' Dixon
said. ``I want them to see that we are good people, friendly
people, and that we want peace.''
   The Soviets will be told of the city's history _ its founding as
a Rock River ferry-boat crossing in 1830 by Dixon's
great-great-great-grandfather John Dixon.
   They'll hear how Abraham Lincoln was stationed at Fort Dixon in
1832 at age 23 and fought Indians during the Black Hawk War, and
how Lincoln first met his Confederate adversary Jefferson Davis
when the two were stationed at the fort.
   The two cities established a sister-city relationship in early
1987 when Kardamyshev initiated greetings to the like-named town in
north-central Illinois.
   It's still not certain whether an Illinois delegation will be
able to visit Dickson, a town of 5,000 located in extreme northern
Siberia, above the Arctic Circle. The city, which was a staging
area for early Arctic explorers, is named for Oskar Dickson, a
19th-century Swedish merchant who provided supplies for the
expeditions.
   ``It's a remote, frontier village established as a weather and
oceanography facility,'' Dixon said. ``It is off-limits and a visit
may be difficult to work out. But I'd like to visit them. I think
it's important.''

   Maria DeSillers went to court Wednesday to fight a
possible jail sentence for failing to turn over financial records
and luxury items allegedly purchased with donations for her late
son's liver transplants.
   At the opening of an often-acrimonious contempt hearing, the
attorney for the court-appointed curator of Ronnie DeSillers'
estate said Ms. DeSillers' fate was in her own hands.
   ``We are here with a sincere sense of regret,'' said Michael
Dribin. ``The curator-trustee has no desire to see Ms. DeSillers
punished ... the key to the jailhouse cell is held by Ms.
DeSillers.''
   As Dribin spoke, Ms. DeSillers muttered ``What a joke.''
   Ms. DeSillers' attorney, Roy Black, said he would show his
client had already complied with the court's demands.
   Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie has repeatedly ordered Ms.
DeSillers to surrender a BMW car, jewelry, clothes and other items
believed bought with about $200,000 of the almost $700,000 donated
to pay for operations on Ronnie.
   So far, however, Ms. DeSillers has turned in only the car. Her
attorneys have complained that the order is unclear and includes
items she bought with with her own money.
   The contempt hearing was scheduled to continue Thursday. The
judge could rule immediately on whether to jail or fine Ms.
DeSillers, or take the decision under advisement.
   When curator Karen Gievers took the witness stand, Black
repeatedly attacked her testimony.
   Christie admonished Black several times to stop interrupting Ms.
Gievers, who testified she had never received documents that would
enable her to determine whether some of Ms. DeSillers' expenditures
were legitimate.
   Black grilled Ms. Gievers on whether she knew the intentions of
all the donors _ who include President Reagan _ and on whether the
money was given in Ronnie's name or his mother's.
   ``To this day I haven't gotten any of the information,'' Ms.
Gievers responded. ``I was trying to find out what the assets
were.''
   Black also criticized the curator for hiring expensive attorneys
without negotiating a fee first, but she said she would not have
had to pay anything if Ms. DeSillers had obeyed the court orders.
   Ms. Gievers also brushed aside Black's contention that by
turning over the financial records, Ms. DeSillers was being forced
to testify against herself.
   ``Ms. DeSillers cannot hide behind the Fifth Amendment and flout
the courts,'' said the curator.
   Black then called to the stand Christine Penrod, whose son was a
classmate of Ronnie DeSillers. Mrs. Penrod said Ms. DeSillers threw
herself into building a foundation for other transplant children
after her son died.
   ``It was disorganized, perhaps misguided _ I think it was her
way of handling grief,'' said Mrs. Penrod. ``Something needs to be
done for these children but it's not Maria DeSillers.'' She said
the effort was sincere, however.
   Ronnie, 7, died at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital in April 1987
after undergoing three unsuccessful liver transplants. Ms.
DeSillers has refused to pay $262,000 to the hospital, claiming
that her son received improper care.
   His case was widely publicized after more than $4,000 gathered
for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet, and
donations began pouring in from around the world.

<HEAD>Officials Say Flood Damage Slowing Relief Effort</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with officials saying supplies slowed by
disrupted transportation and that Western countries not sending
enough aid. Official defends press censorship. No pickup.</NOTE>

   Government officials on Wednesday said
flood-damaged roads and railways were slowing relief to the north
and complained that the United States and Europe were providing
little help, news media reported.
   The governor of Sudan's northern region, Abdul-Aziz al-Amin,
said the situation after flooding in his area was ``disastrous.''
He said ``relief and food supplies are non-existent.''
   In statements made to the daily al-Siyassa, he blamed the
shortage on disrupted transportation and said rail tracks had been
damaged by the floods.
   The state-run Sudan News Agency also said about one million
people in the northern provinces were in urgent need of relief
supplies.
   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 in the northern provinces and around
the capital Khartoum left 1.5 million people homeless. The
government declared five disaster areas at the start of the floods,
including Dongola, 300 miles north of Khartoum, and el-Damer, 160
miles north east of the capital.
   On Tuesday, the waters of the Blue Nile overflowed in Khartoum
and Omdurman across the Nile from the capital, Egypt's state-run
Middle East News Agency reported.
   The confluence of the Blue and White Niles in Khartoum form the
Nile river that runs on through Egypt to enter the Mediterranean
Sea at Alexandria.
   International relief supplies were flown in, but Sudanese
officials repeatedly have said they only met 10 percent of the
actual needs.
   At a tea reception for foreign reporters Wednesday, Sayed
Abdallah Mohammed Ahmed, minister for Culture and Information,
attacked the United States and Europe for ``not supplying Sudan
with anyhing worth mentioning.'' He said 90 percent of relief
material received so far came from Arab countries, or 4,390 tons of
the total 4,775 tons.
   In statements carried by the news agency MENA, Ahmed said 13
Arab states had come to Sudan's rescue.
   ``What we need now is not food or blankets, but medicine and
agricultural material,'' he said. ``It is not important now to send
food, but to help us produce it.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Sudanese authorities said there was no
epidemic outbreak of diseases so far, quelling fears of fatal
diseases resulting from a scarcity of clean drinking water
following recent floods.
   Health officials said 19 cases of suspected cholera in and
around the capital proved to be only a mild form of diarrhea.
   Cholera and acute diarrhea kills the young and the weak. A lack
of fresh water supplies makes even basic treatment difficult.
   Officials said cases of malaria, another gastro-intestinal
infection, are on the rise, as are respiratory tract infections and
eye diseases.
   The reports were carried by the daily al-Ayam newspaper, quoting
unidentified health officials.
   Wednesday's reports seemed to contradict earlier statements from
the Sudanese Red Crescent, a relief organization, which last week
said more than 5,000 people were suffering from severe diarrhea,
most of them children. Officials reportedly had identified some
cases as malaria, cholera and typhoid.
   Following the floods, health officials predicted deadly
epidemics of water-borne diseases as people cut off from drinking
warter supplies are forced to drink from contaminated pools left
behind by the rainstorms and floods.
   In his meeting with foreign reporters, Ahmed defended the
government's decision to impose press censorship, saying these were
``ordinary measures used in democratic countries in Europe and the
United States ... to preserve the security and reputation of the
country.''
   On Tuesday, Ahmed ordered foreign journalists and photographers
to conduct interviews and take pictures only in the presence of an
information ministry representative. He said news stories and films
must be cleared before being allowed out of Sudan.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi a day earlier criticized foreign
media for allegedly exaggerating the disastrous effects of flooding
in the capital and elsewhere, which has been called the worst in
Sudan's history.

   The Defense Ministry reported
Wednesday that Nicaraguan rebels killed three civilians, kidnapped
10 people and wounded two others in separate attacks in recent days.
   A Ministry statement also said 15 of the U.S.-backed rebels,
known as Contras, were killed in ``combat actions in response to
attacks by the counter-revolutionaries on our troops.''
   The leftist Sandinista government and rebels agreed to a truce
in March, but the two sides failed to reach a permanent settlement
in the 7-year-old civil war. Negotiations broke off June 9, and
each side has charged the other with violating the truce.
   The Defense Ministry statement reported six Contra attacks
against government forces between Thursday and Sunday with five
attacks against civilians.
   The statement did not say if any of the casualties included
government troops.

<HEAD>Jackson Ends Three-Day Fast in Protest of California Grapes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson ended a three-day fast protesting
the use of pesticides on California table grapes Wednesday, and
another leading civil rights figure picked up the fast ``in the
name of justice, equity and peace.''
   Jackson and the Rev. Joseph Lowery of Atlanta, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, stood outside a food
store and urged consumers to boycott California table grapes.
   Jackson had been on a water-only diet since Sunday when he
attended Mass with Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm
Workers, as the union leader ended a 36-day fast in Delano, Calif.
   The union is seeking to ban the use of five pesticides it claims
cause cancer. California table grape growers say the pesticides
pose no danger and are needed to fight fungus and pests.
   Wearing a suit and sandals with a small cross of vines hanging
from his neck, Jackson said grape growers won't bend until they're
hit in the wallet.
   ``We can do without the grapes,'' the former Democratic
presidential contender said. ``We cannot do without children, and
we cannot put the nation's health at risk.
   Jackson passed the cross, which was worn first by Chavez, on to
Lowery.
   Lowery said he would fast for three days and then pass the cross
and the fast to actors Martin Sheen and Robert Blake in Washington,
D.C.
   ``I shall fast in the name of justice, equity and peace,''
Lowery said. ``This is our means of sharing the pain and
strengthening the team.''
   Jackson called on consumers to ``adopt a store'' that sells
California table grapes and convince its management to stop selling
the fruit.
   Issa Tadros, owner of eight Horizon grocery stores in the
Chicago area, appeared at the news conference to announce he would
end grape sales.
   ``We will not carry grapes until this stops,'' he said of the
pesticide use.

   The incident occurred a few minutes after midnight at the

   MTI said the driver of the East German car, identified as Konrad
Tiele, disregarded calls from Hungarian border guards and road

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle
told a National Guard assembly Wednesday, ``Dan Quayle doesn't run
away from a fight,'' as he sought during his first solo campaign
trip to set aside questions about his military record during the
Vietnam era.
   In an impassioned defense of his National Guard duty during the
war, the Indiana senator told a cheering audience of 1,000 present
and former Guard members that ``I'm not looking for any medals''
but ``I served loyally.''
   ``Nearly 20 years ago, I had no reason to be ashamed of my
service. And you know what, I'm sure as hell not ashamed of it
now!'' Quayle said. Quayle noted that Missourian Harry Truman also
served in the Guard, and said, ``Harry Truman never ran away from a
fight, and the National Guard never runs away either, and by the
way, Dan Quayle doesn't run away from a fight.''
   Quayle said he ``wasn't looking for favors'' when he entered the
Guard in 1969 and reiterated that ``no rules were broken'' and no
effort had been made to ``influence the process'' of his admission
during the height of the Vietnam War.
   ``I'm not looking for any medals. And I'm not asking for a pat
on the back. But let me say this: I served. I served loyally, and I
served to the best of my ability,'' Quayle said.
   The Indiana senator began this campaign swing seeking to shift
attention from the controversy and focus instead on his message of
peace, freedom and jobs.
   Almost at the very start, he had a good-natured airport
encounter with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, who had just warned Southern state legislators not to ``risk
youthful indiscretion'' in someone like Quayle who might someday
ascend to the presidency.
   In the speech, he criticized Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis for an ``anti-defense attitude.''
   ``One of the worst false impressions Michael Dukakis has put
forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense,''
Quayle said. ``Maybe he sincerely believes that. But he stands for
the opposite, and that position has been clouded over by the
distractions of the last few days.''
   ``I suppose Michael Dukakis is enjoying this firestorm because
it's helping distract people from the issues of this campaign,'' he
said.
   An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday yielded some
encouraging results for Quayle. Sixty-four percent of the
respondents said Quayle's military record should not be an issue in
the campaign, while 27 percent said it should. Also, 42 percent of
registered voters approved of Quayle as the GOP vice presidential
nominee; 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were not sure.
   The poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among 1,762
registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus three
points.
   During the day, Quayle kept out of range of reporters and sought
to concentrate on campaign issues and the prospective virtues of a
George Bush presidency. An aide said Quayle wanted to focus on
``things we want to talk about.''
   Quayle ignored reporters' shouted questions seeking a response
to Bentsen's remarks. Bentsen had tried to exploit Quayle's earlier
comment that his ``youthful indiscretion'' was to blame for his
vote against elevating the Veterans Administration to a
Cabinet-level department.
   Quayle's press secretary, David A. Prosperi, told reporters
later that if Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, were elected
president, the country would be plunged into a ``midlife crisis
because he knows very little about defense issues.''
   In appearances before Midwestern state legislators in Cincinnati
and a Southern legislative conference in Lexington, Ky., Quayle
avoided any discussion of his military record or allegations about
his past association with former lobbyist Paula Parkinson.
   Quayle, 41, the scion of a wealthy Indiana publishing family,
has denied that strings were pulled to get him into the Guard
during the Vietnam War or to gain his admission to Indiana
University Law School after a mediocre performance in college.
   Quayle's father, James C. Quayle, was quoted Wednesday in an
interview with the New York Daily News as saying his son had
majored in ``booze and broads.'' Quayle's spokesman refused comment.
   Quayle has also denied having a sexual affair with Paula
Parkinson, who shared a Florida vacation house with Quayle and
several other House members in 1980. Quayle termed ``outrageous'' a
Parkinson assertion that he had propositioned her.
   In his speeches before state lawmakers Wednesday, Quayle said he
was proud of a jobs training bill he had co-sponsored in the Senate
in the early 1980s. He said the legislation had resulted in
training 3.4 million economically disadvantaged people, ``and there
will be millions more.''
   ``These aren't make-work, makeshift type of jobs. These are real
jobs,'' Quayle said.
   He said he supported reforms of the federal budget process,
which is now carried out annually through budget resolutions and
appropriations and authorization bills.
   ``Congress has a three-layer cake out there, and one of them is
going to have to go,'' Quayle said.
   He said the budget should be drafted every two years, instead of
one, and that the president should be authority to veto individual
budget items rather than entire bills.
   ``I believe that the Congress could stand a little bit of
perestroika, to coin a phrase,'' Quayle said, referring to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of economic restructuring.

   A small plane carrying Attorney General
Hubert H. Humphrey III made an emergency landing Wednesday in a
northwestern Minnesota field, a spokeswoman for Humphrey's U.S.
Senate campaign said.
   The six-seat Beechcraft Bonanza landed about 4:30 p.m. after
apparently developing engine difficulty about 10 minutes earlier,
said Karen Chandler, press secretary for the Humphrey campaign. She
said the four people aboard suffered no injuries.
   The campaign aide said the private plane was en route from St.
Paul to Moorhead, where Humphrey was to attend two fund-raisers and
a meeting Wednesday evening of the attorney general's task force on
prevention of violence against women.
   Other passengers were state Solicitor General Norman Coleman and
Lisa Hertzberg, a press aide.
   Chandler said Coleman told her the plane was in the Battle Lake
vicinity when it began sputtering. An air traffic controller
suggested that pilot Jim Thigpen land in Fergus Falls, about 20
miles away, but the pilot decided he couldn't make it that far, the
spokeswoman said.
   He put the plane down in a grassy field where the group was met
by a Northwest Airlines pilot who had seen the plane in trouble and
drove up to offer assistance, Chandler said.
   The Northwest pilot drove the group to Battle Lake, and the
county sheriff drove them about 75 miles to Moorhead, she said.

   A radio station manager said Wednesday
that his station's hiring of Jessica Hahn as an on-air personality
was more than a publicity stunt.
   Hahn, whose sexual encounter with Jim Bakker led to the PTL
evangelist's downfall, has signed a 30-day contract starting Monday
with station KOY-FM.
   ``We feel that Jessica has the potential to develop into a
strong radio personality,'' said Jay Stevens, the station's
operations manager. ``That, coupled with her desire ... convinced
us.''
   He and Miss Hahn, who appeared in a white leather miniskirt, KOY
shirt and high heels, spent most of a 30-minute news conference
trying to convince reporters that the station was serious about
developing her into a fifth member of its morning show.
   The 29-year-old former church secretary did a test run on KOY's
``Y-Morning Zoo'' show Aug. 18, and listener reaction was
``overwhelmingly positive,'' Stevens said.
   Miss Hahn was modest about her qualifications, though.
   ``I'm not a professional. I know I need to learn a lot and
polish up,'' she acknowledged. Nevertheless, she said she had been
interested in being on radio for years and felt at home with KOY.
   Stevens said Miss Hahn's contract includes promotional
appearances but insisted the station, which has played elaborate
pranks in its search for publicity, was not trying to raise its
ratings. A public-relations firm distributed sheets from the
Tapscan Rating Analysis System showing KOY-FM sixth of 20 Phoenix
stations in listenership.
   The contract has a renewal option and Stevens said, ``We both
hope to make this a long-term agreement.'' But neither he nor Miss
Hahn would say definitely that she planned to be with the station
by October.
   Nude photographs of Miss Hahn following breast-enlargement and
other cosmetic surgery appear in Playboy magazine's latest issue.
   Stevens refused to discuss salary details, but Playboy spokesman
Bill Farley of Los Angeles said the contract included housing and
``very adequate'' compensation.
   Glenn Beck, another personality on the show, described Miss Hahn
as ``the Vanna White of the morning show. She's going to be our
prize-and-weather bunny.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Says Nation Can't Risk `Youthful Indiscretion'; Reagan
Bolsters Bush</HEAD>

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen criticized
Republican rival Dan Quayle's voting record on Wednesday and said
the nation can't risk ``youthful indiscretion'' so close to the
Oval Office. Quayle touted his work on jobs legislation and
defended his military record before a cheering National Guard
audience.
   ``Dan Quayle doesn't run away from a fight,'' the Indiana
senator told a group of 1,000 former and present Guard members in
St. Louis.
   George Bush campaigned in California with President Reagan, who
said Quayle ``stands for the same principles'' as he and the vice
president.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis received an endorsement from the
AFL-CIO in Washington, and charged that the legacy of the Reagan
administration was more jobs but lower family income.
   Meanwhile, two fresh polls indicated that the surge Bush
received during last week's Republican National Convention already
was dissipating. An NBC-Wall Street Journal survey put the vice
president's margin as 44-39, while a Harris survey pegged it at
49-47. Both leads were within the margin of error, indicating the
race is a dead heat.
   The two campaigns also sparred over the timing of campaign
debates for the fall. Dukakis aide Paul Brountas said it was
``inexcusable'' for Bush to decline dates of Sept. 8 and 14
established by organizations interested in staging the
confrontations. Bush campaign chief James Baker said, ``It is
unlikely that a debate can occur prior to Sept. 20.''
   But the political spotlight was uncharacteristically fixed on
campaign understudies, particularly on the 41-year-old Quayle and
the controversy about his Vietnam era stint in the National Guard.
   Democrat Bentsen told Southern legislators meeting in Lexington,
Ky., that Quayle had said earlier in the week that ``youthful
indiscretion'' initially led him to vote against Senate legislation
granting Cabinet-level status to the Veterans Administration.
   Bentsen also noted Quayle told the Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention that he had changed his mind on the subject and now
favored the bill. ``A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote
occurred only five weeks ago,'' Bentsen said. `I don't think
America can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become
our president at any moment.''
   At a news conference following his speech, Bentsen noted
Quayle's reversal on the VA bill and said, ``You've got to stand up
to that kind of heat.''
   He also referred indirectly to Quayle's Vietnam era stint in the
National Guard.
   ``I certainly don't think he's too young,'' Bentsen said of his
Senate colleague. ``But I think you have to have some maturity.''
   He added, ``And I think the breadth of experience that I've had
and the tests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened
to me early on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast.''
   Quayle, in his debut as a campaign soloist, said he had helped
draft the Job Training and Partnership Act in the early 1980s,
which he claimed had provided jobs for millions of workers,
including women and poor people.
   ``This program is working. We have trained 3.4 million
economically disadvantaged people in America so far, and there will
be millions more,'' he said before flying on to Kentucky.
   In his St. Louis speech, Quayle said he ``wasn't looking for
favors'' when he entered the Guard in 1969. He said ``no rules were
broken'' and no effort had been made to ``influence the process''
of his admission during the height of the Vietnam War.
   ``I'm not looking for any medals. And I'm not asking for a pat
on the back. But let me say this: I served. I served loyally, and I
served to the best of my ability,'' Quayle said.
   The NBC-Journal poll yielded some encouraging results for
Quayle. Sixty-four percent said Quayle's military record should not
be an issue in the campaign, while 27 percent said it should. Also,
42 percent of registered voters approved of Quayle as the GOP vice
presidential nominee; 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were
not sure.
   Dukakis made no mention of Quayle as he traveled to Washington
to receive his endorsement from the AFL-CIO. In a speech to union
members, he promised ``new economic patriotism'' based on strong
business-labor relations.
   The Massachusetts governor conceded that more Americans hold
jobs than ever before, but said low-paying positions have been the
legacy of the Reagan administration and that average family income
is no greater than it was 20 years ago.
   ``That's the price our workers and their families are paying for
voodoo economics,'' he said in a speech in a hotel a few blocks
from the White House.
   Bush campaigned with Reagan for the first time since winning the
Republican nomination next week. He sought to deflect attention
away from the controversy over his running mate, accusing Dukakis
of ``looking for a reason'' to veto Massachusetts legislation
requiring teachers to lead their students in recitation of the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so
much?'' Bush asked. Dukakis has said he vetoed the bill after
receiving an advisory opinion from the state Supreme Court that the
measure was unconstitutional.
   Reagan heaped praise on his vice president.
   ``George Bush is a man of action _ a man accustomed to
command,'' Reagan told a rally at the hotel where the president is
staying during a break from his California ranch vacation.
   ``The vice presidency doesn't fit easily on such a man,'' he
said. ``But George Bush is also a patriot. And so he made it fit,
and he served with a distinction no one has ever matched.''
   Dukakis aide Brountas said the Massachusetts governor intends to
go ahead with plans to be in Annapolis on Sept. 14, the date
selected by a bipartisan presidential commission for a debate on
national security issues. He said Bush's decision not to debate
before Sept. 20 ``threatens the full schedule of debates
anticipated for the fall.''
   But Baker said it was ``unlikely'' that Bush could debate before
Sept. 20 because the Republican National Convention concluded only
last week.
   Aides to the two candidates are expected to open face to face
negotiations on debates next week in Washington.
   The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among
1,762 registered voters, the Harris poll Friday through Monday
among 1,310 likely voters. Both had error margins of plus or minus
three points.

   A Soviet fishing vessel collided with a
Panamanian freighter in the fog Wednesday off the Canadian coast,
the Coast Guard said.
   There were no injuries, said Coast Guard Chief Roy Compton.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Cobb said the freighter, Ocean
Fame, took on water from a gash in its bow and proceeded under its
own power to Barkley Sound on Vancouver Island's southwest coast.
Canadian Coast Guard officials examined the freighter.
   Cobb said the Soviet vessel, Irtyshsk, remained in the vicinity
of the collision and was unloading some of its diesel fuel to
another Soviet fishing boat.
   The collision occurred about 6:30 a.m. about 35 miles north of
Cape Flattery, Wash., and the Coast Guard cutter Clover was at the
scene, the Coast Guard said.
   The Soviet vessel carried a crew of 120; the 500-foot Panamanian
freighter, which left Vancouver on Tuesday loaded with grain for
Japan, had a crew of 18.
   Micheline Brodeur of Transport Canada said she did not have
details of the Panamanian ship's damage, but added, ``Apparently
there was some concern for a while that it would sink.''
   The Canadian naval support vessel Glendyne was to check any
damage on the Soviet boat, she said. The Canadian Marine Casualty
Investigation branch would investigate the accident, Ms. Brodeur
said.
   A Navy spokesman in Seattle, Senior Chief James Jones, declined
to speculate on whether the Soviet vessel was gathering
intelligence on Trident submarines based at the Navy's base at
Bangor.
   In the past, Soviet vessels have parked outside the Strait of
Juan de Fuca to gather information about the nuclear submarines,
which must use the strait between coastal Canada from Washington's
Olympic Peninsula to reach the Pacific Ocean.
   Jones said the intelligence-gathering ships usually are not
disguised as fishing vessels and plainly display their radar towers
and other monitoring devices.

   Police converged on strikebound coal mines
and a port, activists said Thursday, after more workers joined
stoppages and Solidarity denounced official repression of the

   The government and workers are struggling for the initiative in

martial law in December 1981 to crush and then outlaw Solidarity,
the first independent labor union in the Soviet bloc.
   Strikers demand higher pay, better working conditions and that

<HEAD>Supreme Court Taking More Tolerant Tack About Religion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seasoned by some new, more conservative members,
the U.S. Supreme Court seems to be occasionally taking a more
tolerant tack about religion's place in public affairs.
   This was indicated in several of the court's rulings in its
1987-88 term, notably in upholding inclusion of religious
organizations in a federal program to fight teen-age pregnancy and
abortion.
   In a time of soaring church-state litigation, the case was among
a dozen of this kind handled in the high court's latest term.
   The Family Life Act of 1981, which critics derisively call the
``chastity law,'' had been challenged as unconstitutionally
advancing religion by funding religious as well as secular groups
to foster sexual discipline among youths.
   There are nearly a million teen-age pregnancies annually in the
United States, with about half of them aborted.
   Under the law, about a fourth of the $10 million spent annually
under the act has gone to religious groups. American Civil
Liberties Union and others charged this unconstitutionally promoted
religion.
   However, in a 5-4 decision on the final day of the court's term
June 30, it upheld the law, saying Congress may recognize ``the
important part that ... religious organizations play in resolving
certain secular problems.''
   Such organizations aren't barred ``from participating in
publicly sponsored social welfare programs,'' wrote Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, adding that any boost to religion was ``at
most incidental.''
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, saying ``government funds
are paying for religious organization to teach and counsel
impressionable adolescents on a highly senstive subject of
considerable religious significance.''
   In another case that turned out favorably for religious groups,
the court let stand an Illinois law exempting religious day-care
centers from state regulations.
   About 33 states have such laws. Churches provide the largest
sponsorship of day-care centers in the nation.
   The Illinois Supreme Court had upheld a state law exempting
church-run centers from state regulations, rejecting a challenge to
it as violating the First Amendment ban against establishing
religion.
   The high court left the ruling in place. The state had argued
that such exemptions enhanced church-state separation by avoiding
state inquiries into religious beliefs as would be required if the
centers were state licensed.
   Another case of historic potential in upholding religious
rights, an 8-1 high court decision overruled a lower court decision
and held the U.S. Roman Catholic Church had a right to appeal a
contempt citation against it.
   The contempt citation had been issued by a district court for
the church's refusal to produce a vast array of internal church
records demanded in a lawsuit by a New York pro-abortion group.
   It sought to have the Internal Revenue Service revoke the entire
church's federal tax exemption on the ground that it had engaged in
political activity opposing abortion.
   Most of the nation's other major denominations, Protestant and
Eastern Orthodox, had sided with Catholic Church in opposing the
attack on its tax exemption _ seeing it as a threat to all
religious bodies.
   Another potentially major decision came when the high court
ruled that former leaders of the New Jersey Legislature had no
legal standing to appeal a lower court ruling that struck down the
state's ``moment of silence'' law.
   The law required a one-minute period of silence ``for quiet and
private contemplation or introspection'' in state public schools at
the beginning of each school day. More than 20 states have similar
laws.
   Under challenges, lower federal courts struck down the law as
violating the religion non-establishment clause. Legislative
leaders appealed, but later lost their positions, and the high
court said they had no standing to appeal. That left basically
unresolved the question of whether moment-of-silence laws are
constitutional.
   Two other church-state cases involved claimed religious rights
by American Indians.
   One of them, them, testing whether the ceremonial smoking of the
hallucinogenic drug peyote is protected by the First Amendment's
free exercise of religious clause, was sent back to the Oregon
Supreme Court. It now must decide if the practice violates Oregon
law.
   In earlier proceedings, the Oregon high court held two state
employees, both American Indians, were entitled to unemployment
compensation benefits following their firing for smoking the drug
in religious ceremonies.
   In another case, the high court ruled that the federal
government may complete a stretch of road through a
government-owned section of northwest California held sacred by
three Indian tribes.
   Among other church-state cases, the high court:
   _Let stand a lower court's ruling that churches must comply with
registration and disclosure requirements in a Tennessee law
regulating political activity in referendum campaigns.
   _Declined to review another case in Tennessee in which a federal
appeals court held parents do not have a right to teach their
children at home when required reading texts offend their religion.

   Christians in Africa and parts of the Middle East
are under increasing pressure to convert to Islam, some African
Christian leaders say.
   The clergymen, at a conference on black churches, contended that
Moslems are waging a holy war in Egypt, the Sudan, Tanzania and
Nigeria, using religious TV broadcasts, job offers and cash bribes
to win over Christians.
   ``When a young man is offered 30,000 pounds in cash ($13,000) _
it takes a person very strong in his faith to refuse the offer,''
said Bishop Antonius Marcos of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt.

Austin Creel, chairman of the university's religion department.

<HEAD>Studies Show More Blacks on Prime Time Network TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More blacks are appearing on prime time
television shows, and not just in stereotypical roles as cute kids,
domestic workers, criminals and jive-talking comedians, according
to industry researchers and observers.
   ``There has been an improvement in the employment of black
performers and the range of character portrayals has improved,''
said Rodney Mitchell, affirmative action administrator for the
Screen Actors Guild. ``No longer are they confined to street types,
non-professionals, crime victims and crime perpetrators.''
   Some credit the success of ``The Cosby Show'' for opening the
doors to more positive black portrayals. A recent Howard University
study of 58 black characters in 26 network shows last season found
that, instead of the lower class roles that dominated the 1970s,
``blacks on television are generally portrayed as belonging to
middle and upper classes.''
   Women played nearly half of the black roles, compared to
previous years when men greatly outnumbered them, the Howard
researchers reported. The study also noted more middle-age and
elderly black characters, fewer obese women and more characters
portrayed as competent.
   Some things haven't changed, the Howard scholars found. Blacks
were still more likely to be cast in situation comedies than dramas
and were most often supporting or minor characters. More than half
appeared in shows with black themes, such as ``Amen,'' ``Cosby,''
``227'' and ``A Different World.''
   ``Black characters continue to be cast primarily in all-black
settings,'' wrote Howard communication researchers Carolyn Stroman,
Bishetta Merritt and Paula Matabane. ``Yet there is a notable
difference in that these all-black settings tend to be upscale
middle class rather than low income.''
   A 1987 study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in
Washington, D.C., found that the number of black characters on TV
rose slowly from 1955 to 1965, when only one in 20 was black, and
more rapidly since 1975, when one character in 11 has been black.
Over the 31 years studied, blacks played 6 percent of all roles.
   ``The civil rights movement ... opened up attitudes,'' said Dan
Amundson, study co-author. ``White audiences will watch black
performers in a wide range of roles, based on the quality of the
show, rather than the racial question.''
   SAG's Mitchell credits union affirmative action pressures,
advocacy by minority rights groups and the success of black-themed
shows for the increasing number of roles. And new shows such as
``Frank's Place'' and ``In the Heat of the Night'' provided
dramatic parts for blacks last season, he said.
   Black viewers have become more important in the 1980s as overall
network audiences dropped in competition with VCRs and cable. But
Mitchell said he had never heard industry officials say they were
improving black roles to attract more black viewers.
   More blacks watch television than do other racial groupings,
according to Nielsen audience data. A recent Nielsen viewing
analysis reported that television usage averaged 10.6 hours per day
in black households, versus 7.3 hours daily in all other homes.
   With just 11 percent of U.S. television homes headed by blacks,
viewing patterns would have to change markedly to directly affect
program portrayals, said CBS television research Vice President
Arnold Becker.
   Even with more viewing ``they're still a minority group'' in the
TV audience, said Becker. ``If blacks really viewed dramatically
different programs than non-blacks then they would have a very
substantial effect. But they generally view not all that
dissimilarly than the rest of the population.''
   Becker, instead of attributing gains in black roles to changing
television economics, said white Americans were more receptive to
mainstream black characters.
   ``The attitude of the world toward blacks has changed,'' he
said. ``People out there are predisposed to accept this kind of
social change.''

   First came the clowns, balloons, cotton candy
and coupons for free hamburgers.
   Then came the hidden fees.
   The carnival atmosphere that was part of banks' efforts to
convince customers to use automated teller machines about a decade
ago has turned strictly business-like, now that the era of
high-tech consumer banking has clearly caught on.
   Banks and savings and loans today charge anywhere from 10 cents
to $3 for ATM services such as cash withdrawals, deposits,
transfers or balance inquiries, compared with no fees and little
freebies when the machines were first introduced.
   Financial institutions originaly installed ATMs because they
were less costly than human tellers. But they're finding now that
their expenses have risen sharply as more of their customers _
about a third on average, or 60 million people nationwide _
regularly use ATMs through expanded regional, state and national
automated networks.
   ``We're providing a much expanded service, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week in a lot of locations, and that's pretty expensive,''
Robert W. Moyer, chief executive officer of Wilber National Bank in
Oneonta, N.Y., said in defending the fees.
   ATM fees have become more evident in recent years. The American
Bankers Association, the banking industry's biggest trade group,
says that about 25 percent of all banks charged for selected ATM
transactions in 1987. That compared with just a handful of banks in
1980 and none the year before.
   More recenlty, Bank Network News, a Chicago newsletter, randomly
surveyed 29 big banks and found that in January 1987 about 55
percent of them charged for ATM use. When polled in May, about 70
percent of those same banks imposed fees.
   Fee structures vary, with some institutions charging more for
withdrawals from checking accounts than savings and others waiving
fees if balance thresholds are met.
   Banks charge the most for ``foreign'' transactions at ATMs owned
by another bank but linked to a customer's bank through a local or
national network. The ABA estimates the cost of an ATM transaction
at ``foreign'' machines is between 57 cents and 66 cents, vs. 40
cents to 56 cents for transactions at a bank's own machine.
   Moyer, who runs the small upstate New York bank, said much of
the expense stems from electronic ``switches,'' when banks transfer
funds to other banks to cover the withdrawals their customers make.
   
   While many industry watchers say most ATM fees are probably
justified, they point out that not all customers are aware of these
charges.
   ``Consumers may not know in advance what the ATM fees are. They
might show up in unusual debit entries with the end-of-the-month
statements,'' explained Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate
Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter.
   ``Ten years ago when banking institutions introduced automated
teller machines they used clowns, cotton candy and balloons ... to
educate you. Now that the institutions have a captive audience
they're socking consumers with higher charges ... simply to know
things like how much money they have in their accounts.''
   The ABA says banks haven't run into any major resistance from
customers because of the fees.
   In a recent report it noted, ``... The fees are user fees which
means consumers can elect to pay the fee if they use the service
and avoid the fee if they do not use ATMs.
   ``ABA encourages consumers to take advantage of the competitive
environment by shopping for the blend of prices and services that
they find most beneficial.''

<HEAD>Drought Puts Spotlight on Underground Irrigation System</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

   When the country's worst drought in half a
century hit this summer, desperate Michigan farmers kept co-op
extension agent Jim LeCureaux's phone ringing.
   Many wanted to know about his tests of a low-cost irrigation
system that also controls flooding and sharply boosts crop yields.
   Hard times have given LeCureaux a ready audience for his pitch
about the wonders of subirrigation.
   ``It's not a new concept. It's just being refined,'' he said
from the office of the Huron County Cooperative Extension Service,
which serves farmers in the tip of Michigan's fertile Thumb region,
a wide peninsula jutting into Lake Huron.
   In controlled studies last year, subirrigated corn fields
produced up to 60 more bushels an acre than non-irrigated fields,
LeCureaux said.
   This year, sugar beets were added to the studies.
   ``It sure helps in dry seasons,'' said LeRoy Kretzschmer, who
uses subirrigation on about 200 acres of the 1,800-acre farm he and
his brothers operate near Caseville. It is one of two county sites
where pilot studies are being conducted this year.
   ``We're kind of going little-by-little now, but eventually, if
this works out, we'll irrigate more,'' he said.
   Kretzschmer and LeCureaux are part of a network of researchers,
agricultural agents and farmers who are fine-tuning an irrigation
technique first used in 19th century Europe.
   Subirrigation is a two-phased water control system that uses
underground pipes, drainage ditches and pumps to keep just the
right amount of moisture in the field.
   ``The idea is very old,'' said Jim Fouss, a researcher at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's lab in Baton Rouge, La. A form of
subirrigation was employed in New York's Central Park in 1858, he
said.
   ``If the drainage system that you use during wet season can be
used to put water back on, then you essentially get it for free,''
Fouss said.
   Ironically, subirrigation is a system for putting water into
fields that once were considered too wet to farm.
   About 100 million acres of U.S. farmland need some kind of
drainage in order to grow crops effectively, according to Fouss,
who is working to design computer rain forecasts to help run
subirrigation systems.
   Typically, the land is low and flat, with a layer of bedrock or
clay within a few feet of the surface, creating a high water table.
   The soil remains saturated from the spring rains and snowmelt,
often forcing farmers to put off planting until late in the growing
season. The same problem often occurs in the fall, making it
difficult or impossible to harvest the crops.
   These soil conditions are common along the Atlantic seaboard, in
the Ohio, Mississippi and Missouri river basins and in portions of
the Great Lakes region, including Michigan's Thumb.
   But as quickly as farmers installed underground drainage on
their land, they began encountering another problem _ drought.
   Farmers in Georgia and the Carolinas ran into this problem when
large-scale drainage projects went in 40 to 50 years ago, said
Claude Phene, a U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist in Fresno,
Calif., who did early subirrigation research while working at a
USDA lab in Florence, S.C.
   Farmers who installed underground drain pipes to remove enough
water in order to plant in the spring often would find their crops
parched for water by summer. But by damming up some of the runoff
in the drainage ditches, they found they could put water back into
their fields through the same pipes.
   By hit or miss, farmers discovered that by conserving a certain
amount of water in drainage ditches, they could maintain proper
moisture in the plants' root zones during drier summer weather as
water flowed back into the fields.
   In prolonged dry weather, however, drainage ditches couldn't
hold enough water to keep the soil moist, so some farmers began
pumping water into the ditches from streams or wells.
   Because of the expense of installing miles of heavy tile pipes,
subirrigation made sense only for high-value crops such as
vegetables. Now, with the development of lighter plastic piping and
laser-guided installation equipment, the system has became feasible
for use on field crops as well, Fouss said.
   ``It's not a major irrigation practice yet, but it's grown quite
a bit in the last 10 years,'' Phene said. The appeal of
subirrigation, he said, isn't so much that it raises yields but
rather that it smooths the ups and downs.
   ``We want consistent production, a sustainable yield. We're not
trying for the maximum yield,'' said George Merva of Michigan State
University, who is conducting research on the most effective water
levels for subirrigating corn and soy beans.
   He and other researchers say it isn't yet clear how widely
subirrigation can profitably be applied.
   Although this year's drought has had disastrous consequences for
many farmers, it might also prod some into seeking greater
independence from natural rainfall, LeCureaux said.
   This year, farmers are willing to listen.
   ``If you're looking for a teachable moment,'' he said, ``you've
got her.''

<HEAD>Bush's Goal Of 30 Million Jobs Is Wishful Thinking</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush took a dive off the deep end when he
pledged to create 30 million jobs over the next eight years,
independent economists and even Republican advisers are saying.
   The wildly optimistic commitment may have been a mathematical
error. Or it may have been sheer exuberance.
   Either way, though, Bush's pledge seems to have been made
without much thought to what could be the sleeper issue of the
1990s: labor shortages.
   Neither party has come to terms with the implications of the
ongoing baby bust, says Ben Wattenberg, senior fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute and author of a 1987 book, ``The
Birth Dearth'' (Pharos Books).
   The annual birth rate per 1,000 women has fallen from 23 in 1960
to 15 last year and is projected to fall farther to 13 in the year
2000.
   Given those figures, the United States would be hard-pressed to
find people to fill even 20 million new jobs in the next eight
years _ unless, of course, it opened the doors to massive
immigration, which seems unlikely.
   ``The lack of a substantial number of young people coming into
the labor force will create major economic dislocations, which can
cause great trouble in employment markets,'' Wattenberg said
Wednesday.
   ``We've never lived through something like this in this country.
We've always been growing, growing, growing. And I think it's a
serious problem,'' he said.
   While public policies have not done much to cope with labor
shortages, businesses have already been forced to respond
creatively.
   Businesses are massively increasing on-the-job training because
they can't hire people with the skills they need. In some cases,
the skills in question are simple reading, writing and arithmetic.
   The fast-food industry is hiring retirees and busing workers
from inner cities to restaurants in labor-short suburbs. Coming
soon are robots that will flip hamburgers, stuff burritos and
spread pizza dough.
   Kelly Services Inc. offers free training on computers, no
strings attached. ``If you train an individual, they do develop a
certain loyalty to you,'' said Thomas Anton, Kelly's executive vice
president.
   Labor shortages are most apparent in fields such as food service
and baby- sitting. But equally critical, perhaps more so, are the
shortages of qualified people at the highest ranks of the labor
force: engineers, for example.
   Thirty percent of the electronics industry's engineers are
immigrants, according to the National Academy of Engineering. If
they chose to stop coming, perhaps because of improving
opportunities in their home countries, such as China, India and
Ireland, this nation would be in a severe quandary.
   The problems of a low birth rate are compounded by societal
problems that have left millions of citizens unable or sometimes
unwilling to take on the challenges of the job market.
   With more than 500 jobs open in New York City's furniture
industry, only 60 people are enrolled in classes at the non-profit
Furniture Training Institute in the borough of Queens.
   ``People in the city are not being connected with careers that
actually exist,'' Al Miller, executive vice president of the
Federal Employment and Guidance Service, told the New York Times
recently.
   Better education, training and social support, especially for
disadvantaged minorities, would obviously help the labor shortage.
But in the long run, nothing would help more than a higher birth
rate.
   That's where Wattenberg's political proposal comes in _ to
encourage more births through education allowances, child
allowances, more generous maternal leave, better child care.
   Wattenberg has been faulted for pushing women to have more
babies, but he says the criticism is unfair.
   ``I just want to make it easier for people to have the option to
do what they want. ... There are a substantial number of people who
would like to have children, but it's getting damn hard these
days.''

<HEAD>Emmy Celebrates Its 40th Anniversary</HEAD>

   Like other 40-year-olds, Sunday night's
Emmy Awards is fighting to stay youthful.
   While liposuction has yet to be contemplated, the ``40th Annual
Prime Time Emmy Awards'' are being produced this year by someone
who has built a career out of spoofing the very medium the Emmys
are intended to celebrate.
   Lorne Michaels, as the creator and original producer of NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' has excelled at trashing television from
top to bottom, from biting game-show and newscast parodies to
scathing ``Highway Patrol'' and ``Ozzie and Harriet'' send-ups.
   But can Michaels satirize the Emmys themselves?
   ``Well, this show won't take itself too seriously,'' Michaels
said.
   If the Emmy telecast, carried live by the Fox Broadcasting Co.
at 8 p.m. EDT, has suffered in the past, it has sprung from its
unerring aptitude for boredom _ last year's ceremony, at four
hours, was just 20 seconds shy of qualifying for a miniseries.
   Michaels said ``too many awards'' are handed out at the Emmys.
That he can't change. ``So, in trying to make the show
entertaining, what I've tried to do is strip it down to its core _
the awards _ and make that go as quickly as possible, and then try
to weave the entertainment parts through it.''
   Michaels promised there would not be any production numbers
``per se,'' whatever that means, and he said he would ``try to
squeeze some comedy'' into the usually dull Governors Award, given
this year to animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.
   Michaels, a six-time Emmy winner, will be joined in the control
booth at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium by Dave Wilson, the longtime
``Saturday Night Live'' director. And he plans to use several
celebrities, including Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke, Danny
DeVito and Michael J. Fox, as hosts rather than depend on an
individual.
   It's hard to say if another new Emmy twist is serious or not. In
one of the stranger moves in Emmy lore, this year's Emmy statuette,
normally cast in gold, pewter and iron, is being played by a person.
   The human Emmy is Norwegian actress Benedikte Handal.
   ``We talked to over a hundred women before we found Benedikte
Handal,'' said Lewis Goldstein, a vice president of off-air
promotion for Fox Broadcasting. ``She had the ethereal quality we
were looking for.''
   Handal is being used in national television advertisements for
the awards broadcast, and her ``ethereal qualities'' will also be
displayed in posters and newspaper spots plugging the show.
   Handal will not, however, be handed out to award winners.
   The closer Emmy races this year revolve around NBC's hot drama
series ``L.A. Law'' and CBS newcomer ``Beauty and the Beast.''
   For the second year in a row, ``L.A. Law'' gathered more
nominations, 19, than any other television program. The series will
be competing for best drama series, best actor in a drama series
for Michael Tucker and Corbin Bernsen and best actress in a drama
series for Jill Eikenberry and Susan Dey.
   ``Beauty and the Beast,'' an improbable hit about a love affair
between an attorney and a hulking, hairy denizen of Manhattan's
underground, and NBC's geriatric comedy ``The Golden Girls'' tied
for the second-most nominations with 12 apiece.
   The nominees for best drama series, in addition to ``L.A. Law''
and ``Beauty and the Beast,'' are ABC's ``thirtysomething'' and
NBC's recently canceled ``St. Elsewhere.'' Joining ``The Golden
Girls'' in the race for best comedy series are ABC's ``The Wonder
Years,'' NBC's ``Cheers'' and ``Night Court'' and CBS' ``Frank's
Place,'' which has yet to be placed on the network's fall schedule.
   The nominees for best miniseries are ABC's ``Baby M'' and NBC's
``Billionaire Boys Club,'' ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' and ``The
Murder of Mary Phagan.''
   Up for best actor in a drama series are ``L.A. Law's'' Tucker
and Bernsen, Ron Perlman from ``Beauty and the Beast,'' Edward
Woodward of CBS' ``The Equalizer'' and Richard Kiley, star of NBC's
``A Year in the Life.''
   Competing for best actor in a comedy series are Ted Danson of
NBC's ``Cheers,'' Fox from NBC's ``Family Ties,'' Tim Reid from
``Frank's Place,'' John Ritter, star of ABC's ``Hooperman'' and
Dabney Coleman, the lead in ABC's canceled ``The `Slap' Maxwell
Story.''
   On the women's side, the nominees for best actress in a drama
series, joining ``L.A. Law's'' Eikenberry and Dey, are Angela
Lansbury from CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and Sharon Gless and Tyne
Daly, co-stars of CBS' ``Cagney & Lacey.'' The finalists for best
actress in a comedy series are Kirstie Alley from NBC's ``Cheers,''
Blair Brown from NBC's canceled ``The Days and Nights of Molly
Dodd,'' and three actresses _ Rue McClanahan, Beatrice Arthur and
Betty White _ from ``The Golden Girls.''
   Television's most popular program, NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
collected just one nomination, for a guest performance by Eileen
Heckart; its spinoff, ``A Different World,'' the second most
popular show, had none.
   For the first time in Emmy history, cable television programs
are eligible for trophies, although chances are slim that any cable
show will emerge with that strong a showing.
   The cable shows drew 15 of the 337 nominations their first time
out _ Home Box Office and Showtime each collected six nominations,
the Disney Channel drew two and Turner Broadcasting System had one.
   Among the cable companies' best chances for an Emmy are best
writing in a comedy series (Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's
Show'' is nominated twice) and best informational special (HBO's
acclaimed ``Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam'').
   NBC leads the three networks with 114 nominations, followed by
CBS with 87 and ABC with 75. The Public Broadcasting Service
gathered 27 nominations and Fox, struggling to become television's
``fourth network,'' drew six.
   In addition to the United States, the awards show will be
broadcast to 21 foreign countries, representing a potential
audience of 1 million viewers.
   Countries planning to broadcast the Emmy program live include
Australia, Canada, the Bahamas, Bermuda, New Zealand and Venezuela.
   Airing the program on a delayed basis will be Bangladesh, the
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea
and Taiwan.

<HEAD>Wide Differences in Child Diabetes Risk Highlight Basic Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White children in San Diego face only about half
the risk of getting the most serious form of diabetes as Finnish
children, suggests new research that found an inexplicable 17-fold
difference in risk across 14 nations.
   The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes runs generally generally
higher in cooler climates, said researchers, who are studying such
differences for clues to the far more basic question of what causes
insulin-dependent diabetes.
   The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the
pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body's
immune system. The 1 million Americans with it must inject
themselves with insulin every day to stay alive. Otherwise, sugar
will build up in their blood and cause such complications as heart
and kidney disease, blindness and nerve damage.
   Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system's
attack. The vast majority of people who develop insulin-dependent
diabetes have particular genes linked to the disease.
   However, most people with the susceptible genetic background do
not develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates is
evidence of an environmental role, said Ronald LaPorte, associate
professor in the epidemiology department at the University of
Pittsburgh.
   Studies also suggest that rates for American children younger
than 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976, which argues for a
change in the environment, said James Warram of the Joslin Diabetes
Center in Boston.
   What could this environmental factor be?
   Viral infections are one theory, since viruses show seasonal and
temperature preferences as does insulin-dependent diabetes. Diet is
another proposed trigger, with some support from animal studies.
   The question is complicated because the immune system starts
attacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetes
symptoms. So any trigger must have acted at some unknown time in
the past, said Jerome I. Rotter of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles.
   Rotter also said much of the geographic difference in rates may
be due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes in
various populations, rather than just environmental causes.
   Geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by an
international team of scientists who compared insulin-dependent
diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries. Their
work appears in the August issue of the journal Diabetes.
   Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 ``person-years'' in
Hokkaido, Japan, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in Finland.
A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent of
following one person for one year.
   Within the United States, the rates per 100,000 person-years
also showed variation: 9.4 in San Diego, 11.4 in Jefferson County,
Ala., 13.4 in Allegheny County, Penn., 15.1 in Colorado, 17.8 in
North Dakota and 20.8 in Rochester.
   Those figures are not adjusted for ethnic differences, which
play a role because whites have higher rates than nonwhites. For
example, figures for white children only give a rate of 13.8 for
San Diego and 16.9 for Jefferson County. North Dakota's rises to
20.3 and Rochester's dips to 20.6.
   The study's overall variation was most pronounced for children
younger than 5, suggesting the unknown environmental agent may
exert more influence in that population, said LaPorte. ``It seems
to be affecting the youngest children the most, whatever it is.''

   Grocery prices jumped 1.4 percent in July, the
biggest monthly increase since early 1984, as the drought's effects
reached supermarket checkout counters, the government has reported.
   However, there was little evidence of accelerating retail price
inflation elsewhere in the U.S. economy, the Labor Department
report indicated Tuesday. Excluding food, overall retail prices
rose just 0.3 percent for the month, slower than the pace of the
first half of 1987, the department said.

   Revco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 28,

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October

October dropped 0.79 cent a gallon to 44.67 cents a gallon.

trader expectations that the API's weekly report, released after
the close of trading, would show higher inventories of oil
products, particularly oil.
   The report indicated that while stocks of gasoline and
distillates rose last week, crude oil inventories declined by
nearly 4.3 million barrels.
   Analysts had expected a buildup of 2 million to 4 million
barrels of crude, said John Azarow of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The API reported gasoline stocks were up 349,000 barrels and
distillate stocks rose 2.1 million barrels.
   Analysts said the oil futures market has lacked direction in
recent weeks outside of the weekly API reports. The market is
awaiting fresh news affecting supply and demand and, particularly,
developments involving the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, they say.
   Last week, the United Nations intervened to stop the fighting
between Iran and Iraq, both OPEC members. Analysts say a permanent
cease-fire increases the chances that the 13-nation OPEC cartel
will cooperate in setting oil production limits, which in turn
would help raise world oil prices.

<HEAD>Kelly Stepping Down As Beatrice Chairman; New Deals In Works?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beatrice Co. is looking for a new chairman and
Donald P. Kelly may be in the market for some new corporate
dealmaking.
   Kelly, a reknowned takeover artist, is resigning as Beatrice's
chairman, the company announced Tuesday, as the company moves
further from megabuck wheeling and dealing to focus on running its
three main foodmaking companies.
   Frederick B. Rentschler, 49, Beatrice's president and chief
executive officer since June 1987, will continue running the
privately-held company on a daily basis.
   Kelly, 66, still will play a role as a director and major
investor in Beatrice, but several analysts see his resignation,
effective Oct. 1, as a sign Kelly wants to deal himself back into
the high-stakes game of corporate mergers and acquisitions.
   ``I think Kelly was put on this earth to do deals and I think
his leaving just reflects that he wants to get back in the game,''
said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   McMillin noted that Beatrice also is losing two key managers
brought on board by Kelly _ J.S. Corcoran, 45, senior vice
president of finance, and William E. Reidy, 57, senior vice
president of strategic planning.
   ``The fact that he took his top financial guy and his top
operating guy with him indicates to me that they'll be looking for
another company to run,'' McMillin said. ``Kelly likes to play
poker. Kelly likes to do deals. He's not going to Florida to retire
and play golf.''
   Liz Sode, Beatrice's vice president of corporate relations, said
Kelly was not available for comment Tuesday. She also said she did
not know, and would not speculate on, his future plans.
   In a statement released by the company, Kelly said: ``We have
helped shape Beatrice into a successful, highly focused,
top-quality consumer products company and accomplished this at a
faster pace than we had originally planned. Today our operating
units have better market shares and better overall operating
profits'' than before a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout engineered by
Kelly in 1986.
   Reporting directly to Renstschler will be the chiefs of
Beatrice's three major foodmaking companies: Albert J. Crosson,
president and chief executive officer of Beatrice Hunt-Wesson Inc.;
Lee O. Lochmann, president and chief executive officer of
Swift-Eckrich Inc.; and Robert H. Burns, president and chief
executive officer of Beatrice Cheese Inc.
   ``This transition from Don to Fred really is in keeping with
Beatrice's focus as an operating company now and with the fact that
it's no longer going to be involved in restructuring and
acquisitions,'' Ms. Sode said. ``Don's forte, of course, has been
in the dealmaking.''
   The 1986 leveraged buyout that took Beatrice private, with
financial backing from the New York investment firm of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., was one of the biggest such deals in U.S.
corporate history.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow
or with money raised by the sale of its assets.
   Since the buyout, Beatrice has sold more than $7 billion in
assets, including its Tropicana Products fruit juice division,
Beatrice International, E-II Holdings Inc. group of companies, and
its bottled water division.
   The company still produces such products as Hunt tomato sauce,
Orville Redenbacher popcorn, La Choy Oriental foods, Butterball
turkeys and County Line cheeses.
   Kelly was chairman, president and chief executive of Esmark,
which made Swift meats and Hunt-Wesson products, when it was
acquired by Beatrice in 1984 after a bidding war with Kohlberg
Kravis. He then left to form his own company before turning the
tables and negotiating the Beatrice buyout in 1986 for a total
purchase price and financing of $8.4 billion, the company said.
   In the fiscal year ended Feb. 29, Beatrice had net sales of
$4.01 billion, but reported a loss from continuing operations of
$105 million because of remaining debt from the buyout, Ms. Sode
said.

<HEAD>Donald P. Kelly: Crusty Dealmaker Leaves Beatrice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surprise announcement that Donald P. Kelly
will leave the chairman's post at Beatrice Co. is no reason for
managers to breathe any easier at companies in need of turnarounds.
   Kelly's personal war chest, garnered from sharp dealmaking,
golden parachutes and willing lenders, virtually guarantees that
he'll resurface on the takeover scene before long, experts say.
   For a man who orchestrated one of the biggest leveraged buyouts
in U.S. corporate history, Kelly, 66, is likely to keep doing what
he does best: turning deals.
   ``It sounds to me as if Don ... (is) regrouping to try to do
something new,'' said Ronald Morrow, a managing director at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It's been widely speculated that Don
wants to start'' a new dealmaking company.
   Kelly's resignation from Beatrice, effective Oct. 1, was
announced Tuesday.
   Observers had been expecting Kelly to spin off part of Beatrice
as a vehicle for acquisitions, particularly after last month's
announcement that for the first time since the $6.2 billion buyout
that took Beatrice private in 1986, the company was not for sale.
   But Kelly may not need an operations base. ``Don's track record
will carry with him wherever he goes,'' said John Bierbusse, an
analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   ``He is regarded as a very savvy individual,'' and companies
Kelly may have targeted ``can be nervous about him,'' Bierbusse
said.
   And who wouldn't be concerned about a man who once said he gets
``more nervous about a 6-foot putt than a billion-dollar deal.''
   Under Kelly's leadership, Beatrice sold off some $7 billion in
assets _ from Tropicana juice and International Playtex units to a
Coca-Cola bottler to Max Factor cosmetics.
   But rumors have been circulating that Kelly has had a falling
out with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the aggressive New York
buyout firm that backed his Beatrice deal. As Bierbusse sees it, a
conflict may have arisen over whether to sell what remained of
Beatrice as a whole or in parts.
   ``If I wanted to go it alone, I could probably raise a lot of
money without KKR,'' Kelly told Fortune magazine last month. ``But
I believe that Don Kelly always needs someone of equal or greater
power than he.''
   Short on modesty and high-brow education but long on instinct,
Kelly was raised on Chicago's rough-and-tumble South Side, starting
work at a gas station when he was barely a teen-ager.
   Kelly, a one-time Navy torpedoman, was known as a quick decision
maker as he worked his way up the corporate ladder at Swift & Co.
While traveling the country as many as 50 weeks out of the year for
Swift, Kelly built relationships with the rank-and-file over
countless beers and cups of coffee.
   He knew he could ``get the benefit of 50 years' experience at
Swift'' just by sitting in a tavern with an employee, he told
Fortune.
   By 1977, Kelly was raking in a six-figure salary as chief
executive of the food conglomerate Esmark Inc., the new name for
Swift, which he skillfully pruned and pared. When Esmark was
acquired by Beatrice in 1984, Kelly was believed to have made as
much as $20 million.
   Two years later, Kelly won his own battle for Chicago-based
Beatrice. Backed by Kohlberg Kravis, Kelly took the company private
in a $6.2 billion deal made under the premise that the whole was
worth less than its parts.
   Kelly then formed E-II Holdings Inc., a conglomerate made up of
Beatrice subsidiaries, with the intention that it would buy and
sell other companies through leveraged transactions. But E-II was
acquired by American Brands Inc. for $2.7 billion earlier this year
after E-II made a bid to take over that company.
   Proceeds from the E-II sale were estimated to have put $50
million in Kelly's pocket, in addition to a golden parachute
severance agreement valued at about $2.5 million.
   Kelly was unavailable to comment on his future plans. But as he
told Fortune, ``I can be very convincing and very hard to change
when I get going on something. I get going like a freight train
...''
   Observers are certain of only one thing. As one put it, ``he
ain't gonna retire.''

<HEAD>Trial Date Set In Shamrock Challenge To Stock Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. says it discussed
increasing an employee stock ownership plan ``long before there was
any whisper'' of a takeover bid from Roy E. Disney's Shamrock
Holdings Inc.
   Shamrock, a California investment firm owned by the Disney
family, claimed in a lawsuit filed in July that Polaroid improperly
increased an employee stock ownership plan from 5 percent to 14
percent to help thwart an unwanted acquisition.
   Carolyn Berger, a vice chancellor of Delaware's Court of
Chancery, scheduled hearings for Oct. 19-25 on Shamrock's suit to
halt the expansion, a court clerk said Tuesday.
   Cambridge-based Polaroid is a Delaware-chartered corporation.
Delaware's takeover law prohibits acquirers who obtain 15 percent
of a company's stock from completing a takeover for three years,
unless they have approval from the target's board of directors or
acquire at least 85 percent of the target's stock.
   Richard F. DeLima, Polaroid's vice president and secretary, said
Tuesday the company's board of directors had considered increasing
the size of the ESOP after it first was approved in March.
   ``By the time of the July (board) meeting, we were aware of
Shamrock's interest in the company and were thoughtful about
whether our plans for the ESOP might be interfered with,'' he said.
   DeLima said that in the period between the ESOP's approval and
its increase, Polaroid's board determined it could increase the
size of the stock issue to 10 million shares with ``relatively
modest'' reductions in pay and benefits.
   On Aug. 16, Polaroid rejected a sweetened takeover proposal from
Shamrock of $40 per share and 40 percent of any settlement in
Polaroid's $5.7 billion patent infringement case against Eastman
Kodak Co.
   Shamrock, which owns 6.9 percent of Polaroid, contends Polaroid
increased the number of shares in the stock issue after getting
wind of its bid.
   The increased ESOP was announced July 12 as part of a
reorganization that included the $300 million stock purchase plan,
up to 800 layoffs and entry into the conventional film market.
Polaroid last week announced it was targeting 1,500 early
retirements in a streamlining effort aimed at fighting the takeover.
   One Wall Street securities analyst said that because employees
who own the stock can decide whether to sell their shares, a
hostile takeover of Polaroid technically is not impossible despite
the 14 percent employee control.
   ``As a practical matter, it really does make it harder,'' said
the analyst, who asked not to be named. ``The legal fiction is that
each employee is an individual stockholder. ... They can play the
arbitrage business too.''

<HEAD>Texans Applaud Windfall Profits Tax Repeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oil producers and politicians say the repeal
of the federal windfall profits tax is only the first step needed
to help revive the oil and gas industry.
   Financial incentives for exploration and to keep marginally
producing wells in operation also are needed, oilmen say.
   The landmark trade bill President Reagan signed into law Tuesday
in California included the repeal of the eight-year-old windfall
profits tax on oil companies.
   John E. Watson, president of the Texas Independent Producers and
Royalty Owners Association, said the trade group had fought for
repeal since the tax was signed into law in 1980.
   The windfall profits tax was enacted in exchange for the
phase-out of price controls on domestic oil. Congress was
attempting to recapture some of the money oil companies were
expected to make when prices increased after full decontrol began
in 1981.
   About $77.3 billion in taxes have been collected since it was
imposed.
   Although low oil prices have kept oil companies from paying much
windfall profits tax during the past 2{ years, oil producers still
have had to certify their production and report it to the Internal
Revenue Service, Watson said.
   The base crude oil price upon which the tax is levied is between
$19 and $20 a barrel for independent producers, Watson said. Crude
oil sold for about $15 a barrel Tuesday.
   ``Of course, when you're not paying any tax, and it gets
repealed, it's not going to have a whole lot of immediate monetary
effect on you,'' Watson said. ``Some accounting work will be taken
off our back, hopefully.''
   Both U.S. senators from Texas, Democratic vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen and Republican Phil Gramm, played prominent
roles in the effort to repeal the tax.
   ``It is in fact the first positive step Congress has taken on
oil in a decade,'' Gramm said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
``They (oil companies) won't have to figure in this confiscatory
tax in figuring their benefits.''
   But Watson said that to further help the beleaguered oil and gas
industry, federal financial incentives are needed for marginal and
stripper wells.
   Stripper wells generally produce less than 10 barrels of oil a
day. Wells are considered marginal if production is low in
comparison to the amount of revnue obtained, Watson said.
   He also tax credits are needed for exploratory wells.
   Major oil companies fared well in the last quarter, said Watson,
whose organization includes about 4,000 independent producers and
royalty owners.
   ``Independents, on the other hand are still struggling. They're
still falling by the wayside,'' he said.
   Gramm said the oil industry has continued to pay an estimated
$100 million in complying with the tax rules during each of the
past two years, even though oil companies have paid only small
amounts of the actual tax.
   The federal government has spent about $15 million each of the
past two years for paperwork overseeing the tax, he said.
   Gramm said other measures, including tax incentives to spur
drilling and deregulation of gas prices, are still needed to boost
the industry.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower Against Most Currencies, Gold Falls Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today following remarks by
Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita.
   Gold prices also fell slightly in extremely quiet trading.
   The dollar slid after Sumita said the West German mark's decline
was ``inexplicable'' and termed a further drop in the yen as
undesirable.
   Selling pressure on the dollar then intensified when dealers
reported that the Deutsche Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank,
was selling dollars on the open market.
   ``No matter how well-bid the dollar still is, after the massive
interventions of the past few days, a pause is needed,'' said one
senior trader in Rome.
   But he stressed that market sentiment remains favorable toward
the dollar and that the currency could still rebound.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 134.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8957 West German marks, down from 1.9060; 1.5990
Swiss francs, down from 1.6055; 6.4415 French francs, down from
6.4635; 2.1395 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,406.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,407.50; and 1.2305 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2303.
   In London, the British pound was unchanged from late Tuesday at
$1.6795.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432 a troy ounce and at
midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $432.10. Both were down from Tuesday's late
bid of $432.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $432.10, down from $433 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 59 cents to close at a bid $434.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.73 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.74.

<HEAD>Fed Cattle Prices Up Sharply in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of fed cattle are topping $70 per
hundredweight in late August, up sharply from $66 in July, says the
Agriculture Department.
   ``The recent price strength reflects tighter supplies of
finished (fattened) cattle, stronger export demand and continued
brisk movement at retail,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said Tuesday.
   In all, cattle slaughter in August may rise only 8 percent from
July, although there are two additional working days this month,
which would suggest as much as a 10 percent increase from July, the
agency reported.
   ``Cow slaughter has begun picking up,'' the report said.
``However, this appears to be a seasonal movement of beef cows off
grass (pasture) rather than a forced drought movement.''
   There had been an increase in cow slaughter earlier this summer
as some producers in the drought-stricken Northern Plains and in
the lakes states were forced to send beef and dairy cows to market
because of feed shortages.
   In many cases, however, quality breeding animals have been
purchased by producers in other areas where feed is available, thus
forestalling massive sell-offs of herds.
   According to federal inspection reports, the slaughter of beef
cows this year through the first week in August totaled about 1.89
million head, down 9 percent from the same period in 1987. airy cow
slaughter, at 1.66 million head, dropped 3 percent.
   Prices of fed cattle in the southern Great Plains are selling
for more than $70 per 100 pounds of live weight in late August, up
from $66 in July, the report said.
   Beef from cows goes mainly into hamburger and processing, while
grain-fed steers and heifers provide the higher-grade cuts found in
supermarkets.
   Looking at pork, the report said weekly slaughter is expected to
increase sharply in September, pushing prices down.
   Meanwhile, hot weather has disrupted marketings and slowed
weight gains of hogs. That has lent some support to ``an otherwise
weak market'' this summer, the report said.
   Wholesale prices of dressed broiler chickens in early August
remained around 70 cents a pound, well above the 53 cents of a year
earlier. Prices should average around 61 to 65 cents a pound during
the third quarter, the report said.

   The Agriculture Department says farmers have
developed conservation plans for protecting 54 million acres of
highly erodible cropland, about 38 percent of the 143 million acres
targeted for protection by the 1985 farm law.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the Soil Conservation Service, said
Tuesday that plans have been put into effect on 17 million acres,
or about 12 percent of the affected land.
   Under the 1985 law, farmers who raise crops on highly erodible
land must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989, and
implement it fully by Dec. 31, 1994, to remain eligible for USDA
program benefits.
   ``We are on target for meeting the 1989 deadline,'' Scaling
said. ``We hope to have 65 percent of the plans completed by the
end of 1988 and the remaining 35 percent completed by the end of
1989.''
   However, Scaling cautioned farmers not to wait until the last
minute to request technical assistance from SCS because they might
have a long wait.

   Exports of U.S. horticultural products such as
fruit and nuts totaled $246 million in June, a 20 percent increase
from a year earlier, says the Agriculture Department.
   The shipments, not counting those to Canada, included a strong
showing by all products within the horticultural category.
   ``Sales of fresh fruit and tree nuts accounted for 49 percent of
export value in June,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service reported Tuesday. ``Inshell almond exports reached $21.7
million, with most shipments going to the European Community and
Japan.''
   Japan also accounted for 86 percent of the $21.6 million worth
of lemons and grapefruit exported in June, the report said.

<HEAD>Figgie International To Move Corporate Headquarters Back To
Cleveland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Figgie International, which moved its
corporate headquarters to suburban Richmond in 1982, is returning
to Cleveland, a newspaper reported today.
   Cleveland Councilman John E. Barnes told The Richmond
Times-Dispatch that the company will build a new headquarters on
600 acres of city-owned land just outside Cleveland in Warrensville
Township. Figgie will buy the land from city, Barnes said.
   ``There are several reasons'' for Figgie's decision to leave
Richmond, Barnes told the newspaper. ``Cleveland is within 500
miles of nearly 60 percent of the nation's population. It is a
strategic location and it is hot for development now.''
   The move will add at least 1,500 jobs to the Cleveland area and
possibly as many as 15,000 when operations are at full steam,
Barnes said.
   Officials in Henrico County, where Figgie bought 1,500 acres in
1982, said they had done everything they could to persuade the
company to stay.
   ``I'm sorry to see them leave,'' said Supervisor Richard W.
Glover. ``Certainly we'd like to have them here. I think they're
quite an asset to Henrico County, but the land stays here. I'm sure
that there will be others to come and I'm sure that there will be
others to go.''
   Figgie officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.
   A news conference was scheduled for 3 p.m. today in Cleveland to
make a formal announcement of the move, Barnes said.
   Harry E. Figgie Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, had
said in April that the company moved to Richmond from its former
headquarters in Willoughby, Ohio, because of the Virginia city's
stable labor climate, good general business conditions and access
to transportation systems. He said there would have to be an
economic reason to move back to Ohio.
   Revenues in 1987 for the diversified company, which makes a
range of products from baseballs to fire trucks, were a record
$1.02 billion, up 11 percent from 1986. Its 1987 profits were $49.3
million, up from $42.4 million in 1986. Sales in the first quarter
of this year increased 12 percent over the same period last year.
   The paper reported that sources said tax advantages lured the
company to move to Cleveland.
   ``I would think it's more than some tax abatement,'' said Paul
Ellsworth, president of the Metropolitan Richmond Chamber of
Commerce, citing the expense of moving. ``There have to be a lot of
issues.''
   Henrico supervisors said they had not known of the impending
move until last night and did not know if the company intends to
sell its Virginia property.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Union Back To Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 longshoremen protesting the
use of non-union labor to load explosives onto a military ship have
been ordered to return to work by a federal judge.
   A temporary restraining order was issued Tuesday by U.S.
District Judge Howell W. Melton against members of International
Longshoreman's Association Local 1408, who had refused to return to
work at Blount Island until the ship left port.
   Charles Spencer, president of the ILA local, said the workers
would immediately comply with the judge's order.
   The court order was requested by the Jacksonville Maritime
Association, which represented the owners of four ships filled with
Hondas, Mazdas, Isuzus and Subarus waiting to be unloaded by the
ILA.
   The union had refused to unload the ships to protest the use of
non-union labor by Florida Transportation Services Inc. of Fort
Lauderdale to load explosives on a military ship.
   A similar work stoppage occurred on June 20 when the union
refused to work when the same company unloaded explosives from
another military ship.
   The union claimed the use of non-union labor to handle the
explosives was unsafe because the workers were inexperienced in
handling the devices.
   The judge's injunction will remain in effect until Sept. 2 when
the union and the Maritime Association will meet in his courtroom.
The judge asked the two parties to try and work out their
differences by that time.
   The next scheduled work by Florida Transportation is Sept. 8
when it will unload explosives from a ship.

<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. has agreed to pay two
former executives who claimed they were illegally fired for
refusing to offer bribes to foreign officials a total of $25
million, ending a bitter four-year legal battle.
   In announcing the agreement Tuesday, U.S. District Judge William
O. Bertelsman said the settlement was ``fair and reasonable.''
   Ashland Chairman John R. Hall, Senior Vice President Richard
Spears and the company also were assessed a total of $3 million in
punitive damages for their treatment of the two men.
   Former vice presidents Bill McKay and Harry Williams had claimed
they were illegally fired for refusing to offer bribes to foreign
officials or to cover up such bribes.
   A court earlier had found that Ashland had violated the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by engaging in a
pattern of illegal interstate activity to obtain oil in the late
1970s and early 1980s that led to the men's dismissal.
   A spokesman for Ashland Oil and an attorney for McKay declined
to comment on the settlement except to confirm it. Attorneys for
Williams could not be reached for comment.
   Bertelsman said McKay and Williams would decide how they would
split the $25 million.
   A hearing on a request by the company for a new trial or for a
different judgment that had been scheduled for Thursday was
canceled.

   Unions representing 120,000 General Motors Corp.
workers in Europe criticized the automaker Wednesday for moving
toward longer shifts as well as weekend and night work.
   The new policy will mean increased stress, fatigue and
disruption of family life, the International Metalworkers'
Federation said.
   Auto industry union officials from West Germany, Britain, Spain,
Belgium, France, Austria and Portugal met under the federation's
auspices Wednesday in Geneva to coordinate strategy.
   A federation statement also said GM management has sought to
increase plant running time since moving its European headquarters
to Zurich in 1986 in a bid to reduce social regulation by the
European Economic Community to a minimum.
   At its Antwerp plant, GM has begun 10-hour shifts and regular
Saturday work under the threat of plant closures and layoffs, the
federation's general secretary Herman Rebhan said.
   GM Spain has introduced night shifts and hired many temporary
contract workers with little job security, he said.
   West German unions have resisted similar moves but have been
threatened with 9,000 layoffs by 1992, Rebhan added.
   ``These new shift systems will worsen future conditions for
workers,'' he said. ``The price is being paid for by workers'
families.''
   The federation groups unions in heavy industry around the world.

   Kids are changing in Japan, appearing to lose
interest in some of the world's most timeless creatures _ bugs.
Purveyors of insects say modern entertainments like computer games
have slowed their sales to a crawl.
   ``This has been a terrible year for sales,'' said Mitsuo Otsuka,
manager of the Insect Corner at Tokyo's Takashimaya department
store.
   Otsuka said the store used to sell $380 to $480 worth of insects
on a good Sunday. ``Now we're lucky if we can sell half that
much,'' he said.
   In rural Japan, the sight of a child with net out to nab a
cicada or dragonfly is common. But in the city, Otsuka and other
bug salesmen say hopping insects are no match for modern diversions.
   ``It's computer games. Kids are more interested in machines
these days,'' Otsuka said.
   Even so, he said, Takashimaya expects to sell about $6,000 worth
of bugs this year.
   The bug-hunting season in Japan hits its peak in early July and
lasts through August. Rural children collect the bugs near their
homes and keep them in plastic cages sold at local pet stores. The
children also are encouraged to bring their bugs to school, where
they are studied in science classes.
   No one knows when the summer pastime began among Japanese
children, but ancient scrolls contain pictures of people keeping
bugs in their homes.
   To city kids, the hunting ground is often the rooftops of
department stores like Takashimaya, where such exotic creatures as
the coleopteran, cricket and stag beetle are easy prey _ for the
right price.
   A clerk at the Tokyu department store's pet shop said she had
sold a 3-inch male stag beetle for $770 early this month. ``But
only insect-crazy adults buy those bugs, not kids.''
   A medium-range item, she said, was a pair of smaller stag
beetles. The beetles, which came with a plastic cage, dirt and a
few slices of rotting eggplant, were priced at $77.
   ``It's a real buy,'' she said. ``Until yesterday the price was
15,000 yen ($115).''
   Otsuka said Takashimaya doesn't sell pricey insects anymore, and
relies on the smaller stag beetles, the Homoeogryllus japanicus, or
bell-ringing insect and the coleopteran, or Atlas beetle. Most of
Otsuka's insects were selling for $1.54 to $4.60.
   ``The male Atlas beetle is the most popular with the kids
because its `horns' are shaped like a samurai helmet,'' he said,
referring to the ancient Japanese warriors.
   ``When I was a child growing up in Tokyo they didn't sell bugs
in department stores,'' said Otsuka, who has been in charge of
Takashimaya's bugs for the past 10 years. ``But children now have
less chance to see insects in their natural environment. It's very
sad to think that they have lost interest.''

   Bell Atlantic president and chief operating
officer Raymond W. Smith has been elected president and chief
executive officer to take over when Thomas E. Bolger resigns on
Dec. 31.
   The company announced Tuesday that Bolger will remain chairman
of the board for a transition period into 1989.
   ``The time is right for an orderly transition of leadership, and
Ray Smith is the right person to lead Bell Atlantic to a successful
future,'' Bolger said.
   Philip A. Campbell will continue as vice chairman and chief
financial officer, reporting to Smith. Also reporting to Smith will
be Robert A. Levetown, executive vice president and general counsel.
   Bolger was elected chairman and chief executive officer of Bell
Atlantic in October 1983, when the company was still part of the
Bell System.
   ``Tom Bolger has led Bell Atlantic through the uncertain
currents of divestiture to a position of prominence in the
telecommunications industry,'' Smith said. ``Our challenge now is
to build on the solid foundation he has created.''
   Smith has served as Bell Atlantic's president and chief
operating officer since November 1987.
   Previously, he served as vice chairman and chief financial
officer with responsibilities for Bell Atlantic's financial plans,
external affairs, human resources, strategic direction and
diversification.

Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>DP Holdings Gets Approval to Buy Two California Thrifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   DP Holdings Inc. received federal
regulatory approval Tuesday to acquire two California savings and
loan institutions, including one that is insolvent.
   DP Holdings, based in San Francisco, is an investment group
headed by former Treasury Secretary William Simon and Preston
Martin, the former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   DP Holdings plans to raise as much as $207.5 million in new
capital to finance the acquisition _ then merger _ of insolvent
Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo, and Western Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Marina del Rey.
   The acquisition will be aided by a federal assistance package
totaling an estimated $565 million. It was the 77th resolution of
an insolvent thrift by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board so far this
year.
   Bell Savings had been in the Bank Board's management consignment
program for three years.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will contribute to
the acquisition with an estimated $500 million note and by
purchasing $15 million of preferred stock of DP Holdings.
   The FSLIC also will receive 25 percent of the common stock of DP
Holdings, although its shares will be non-voting.
   The FSLIC will share on an 80 percent-20 percent basis any
losses on certain assets until DP Holdings absorbs $35 million.
Thereafter, the FSLIC will provide 100 percent coverage on those
assets. It also will receive 80 percent of certain gains from the
sale of covered assets.
   With the acquisition, DP Holdings will boost its assets to
nearly $8 billion from the current $3.5 billion.
   Other thrifts owned by DP Holdings include Westcoast Savings and
Loan of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; Honolulu Federal Savings and
Loan; and Southern California Savings and Loan.

<HEAD>Cigna To Sell Horace Mann Subsidiary For $500 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of the Springfield, Ill.-based
Horace Mann Cos. should not have to worry about moving after Cigna
Corp. announced it would sell the insurance subsidiary to a new
corporation for $500 million, officials said.
   The investment banking firm Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, a
management buyout specialist, arranged and will finance the cash
purchase announced Tuesday.
   Investors in the new corporation will include Paul Kardos,
president and chief executive officer of Horace Mann, as well as
other Horace Mann senior managers and Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen.
   Kardos said the new arrangement would ensure Horace Mann's
remaining a major business in Springfield. Cigna had announced Aug.
3, 1987, that it would sell Horace Mann.
   ``When it was announced that we were on the block ... there was
a lot of speculation and there were a lot of questions being
asked,'' Horace Mann spokesman John O'Shea said.
   Mann employs more than 2,600 people nationwide, about 1,400 of
them in the Springfield area, and speculation centered on whether a
new buyer would move or cut back.
   ``No one could say that would or wouldn't happen'' until
Tuesday's announcement, O'Shea said of such questions. ``There's no
plans for that.''
   The agreement, the 26th management buyout in the 19-year history
of Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, is subject to regulatory approval
and completion of undisclosed financial arrangements.
   ``The sale of Horace Mann is a further step in an effort to
better focus our strategic emphasis on commercially oriented
insurance and investment products,'' Cigna chairman Robert D.
Kilpatrick said.
   Kardos said Horace Mann has had ``a constructive relationship
with Cigna,'' but said all parties in the deal would benefit.
   ``Horace Mann will have the independence to control its own
destiny and maintain the management philosophy and employee
relations upon which the company has been built,'' Kardos said.
   Horace Mann sells personal life, auto and homeowners insurance,
as well as group and annuity products primarily to the educational
market.
   The company had 1987 revenues of $720 million with assets of
almost $2 billion. Its book value as of June 30 was about $340
million.

<HEAD>EEC To Defend Itself Against U.S. Trade Bill If Necessary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Wednesday reiterated it will defend its international trade rights
if these are damaged by the U.S. trade bill President Ronald Reagan
has signed into law.
   EEC External Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq said in a
statement the bill confirmed a U.S. tendency ``to interpret
international trading rules unilaterally.''
   ``The Community stands ready to defend its legitimate interests
each time these are threatened by unilateral measures ... by U.S.
authorities on the basis of the trade bill,'' he said.
   De Clercq said he would seek an ``adequate'' EEC response to the
bill when the EEC Foreign Ministers meet here Sept. 26.
   De Clercq said the EEC had trade rights in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, the international trade organization, and
that it will ``defend them if necessary.''
   President Reagan signed the trade bill into law on Tuesday.
   Among others things, it gives U.S. negotiators more bargaining
room at international trade talks, boosts U.S. ability to fight
restrictive trade policies of other nations and allows the
president to block foreign investments if these are seen to impair
U.S. national security.
   The EEC objects to portions of the bill including a section
raising retaliatory powers in trade and to the extension for two
years of the Export Enhancement Program. The program pays surplus
farm commodities from government bins to exporters to boost
overseas sales. The program has a price tag of $2.5 billion.
   A Commission spokesman said the EEC ``will check, on a
case-by-case basis, to see how the bill is implemented but we first
want a reaction from the member states.''
   He noted that the bill's contents clashed with President
Reagan's strong views on free trade guarantees.
   The president signed the bill and, in a speech, acknowledged
``it could lead to an import fee that would be illegal according to
international law and inconsistent with our goal of moving toward a
free world trade.''
   In his statement, De Clercq said the United States had declared
at the Toronto summit of industrialized nations in June that
``nations must continue to resist protectionism and the temptation
to adopt unilateral measures.''
   The EEC also was party to the declaration.

<HEAD>Harcourt Brace to Lay Off 750 Theme Park Workers</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The dismissal of 750 workers in six Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc. theme parks around the country is part of a
``belt-tightening'' program by the parent of Sea World and other
facilities, executives said.
   The layoffs announced Tuesday affect about 10 percent of the
park system's 7,500 full-time employees, said Robert Evanson, a
senior vice president and chairman of Harcourt Brace's parks
operation. They include nearly 350 layoffs in Central Florida.
   ``Employee cuts are a routine part of any corporate
belt-tightening. We will be a more efficient company,'' said Dan
LeBlanc, a spokesman for San Diego Sea World in California, which
will lose about 150 employees.
   Orlando-based Harcourt Brace, a major publishing company,
reported a net loss of $62.9 million on revenue of $446.6 million
in the second quarter. The company repelled an unwelcome takeover
bid last year from British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell by
adopting a $3 billion recapitalization plan and plunging into debt
before selling off several assets.
   A total of 334 workers have received layoff notices at company
facilities in Central Florida, including 113 at Sea World, 161 at
Boardwalk and Baseball near Haines City and 60 at Cypress Gardens
in Winter Haven. An additional nine park support workers will be
laid off from corporate headquarters.
   About 215 employees were fired Tuesday at Sea World of Texas in
San Antonio. Harcourt Brace operates another Sea World in
Cleveland, but there was no word on job cuts there.
   The fired workers, ranging in experience from several months to
more than 15 years, will leave no later than Sept. 6.
   Departments involving care of the parks' animals and direct
services to park visitors were largely spared.
   ``The lines aren't going to be any longer at the food stands or
anything like that,'' said LeBlanc. ``Animals will continue to
receive the world-class care that they're used to. Those areas
barely have been touched.''
   Evanson, 51, was appointed to the park system chairmanship
Monday, replacing Jack O. Snyder, who resigned last month amid a
management reorganization.
   Evanson has been with Harcourt Brace since 1985 and previously
served as deputy for publishing. Without being specific, he said
the newer parks in Florida and Texas had the largest cutbacks.
   The company's theme parks employ about 7,500 full-time employees
and bring in seasonal help during the peak summer months to push
the system's work force to 11,000 or 12,000.
   Most of the temporary workers are laid off soon after Labor Day.
All of Tuesday's layoffs involved the permanent work force.
   Despite the layoffs, LeBlanc said Sea World's shows and other
attractions will remain unchanged.

<HEAD>Papers Ask for Union Support in JOA Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit's two major daily newspapers are asking
their six unions to support an attempt to overturn a 30-day stay
blocking implementation of the joint operating agreement.
   The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News on Tuesday asked the
unions, which originally opposed the partial merger, to sign briefs
asking U.S. District Judge George Revercomb in Washington D.C., to
overturn the decision.
   Revercomb is to hold a hearing Sept. 8.
   The unions represent 80 percent of the 4,200 employees at both
papers. Union officials were mixed on whether they would comply
with the papers' request.
   ``I imagine we're probably going to sign it, unless there's
something in there we really can't agree with,'' said Joel Wilson,
president of Mailers Union Local 2040.
   ``I'm against it, the way that thing is worded,'' said Donald
Kummer, administrative officer of The Newspaper Guild of Detroit.
   Robert Hall, Free Press general manager, said the three-page
brief says the papers are convinced ``that the Free Press is in
probable danger of financial failure.''
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved a joint
operating agreement between the two newspapers Aug. 8.
   On Aug. 17, U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green issued an order
blocking the partial merger, saying there was a strong likelihood
JOA opponents could have Meese's decision overturned.
   Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the Free Press, has said it would
close the paper if the JOA is denied. Under the plan, the Free
Press and News would combine some business functions but maintain
separate editorial staffs.

   The stock market pushed broadly higher today
after losing ground over the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has fallen nearly
38 points over the past three sessions to its lowest level since
late May, was up 10.49 at 1,999.82 after 30 minutes of trading.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 5 to 3 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 493 up, 296 down
and 588 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 18.09 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 22.63 million shares on Tuesday.
   The market has been trending lower all month in sluggish trading.
   Investors have generally shown little inclination to buy stocks
because they are fearful that the recent pace of economic expansion
is strong enough that inflation is likely to pick up.
   On Tuesday, the government reported that consumer prices were up
modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled.
   But while the reports sparked a mild rally in bond prices,
stocks failed to follow through.
   Nonetheless, some analysts feel a mild rebound may be coming
because stocks have fallen so far in the past few weeks.
   Stock traders are also looking toward the government's report
set for release on Thursday of its latest revision in
second-quarter economic growth. Among the early active issues on
the NYSE, Kansas City Power & Light was unchanged at 29, Wickes was
down [ at 13 and Zayre was up { at 22{.
   The NYSE index was up 0.45 at 146.39. At the American Stock
Exchange, the composite index was up 0.46 at 292.46.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.89 to close
at 1,989.33. That is its lowest close since it ended at 1,956.44 on
May 27.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
552 issues up, 811 down and 580 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 119.54 million shares, down from 122.25
million in the previous session.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC said Wednesday it purchased
a 4.5 percent stake in Irish Distillers Group PLC as part of a
hostile attempt to acquire Ireland's largest distiller.
   Working through the subsidiary GC&C Brands Ltd., Grand Met
offered 253 million Irish punts, or about $354 million for Irish
Distillers late last week, but Irish Distillers' board rejected the
offer on Monday.
   The new bid, made following GC&C's restructuring last week as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Grand Met, replaces a $278 million offer
made by GC&C in May. GC&C originally was controlled by a
three-party consortium, which also included Guinness PLC and
Allied-Lyons PLC.
   The original offer attracted only 20.34 percent of Irish
Distillers' shares before protests by the European Commission
forced the consortium to disband.
   EC officials said the consortium had decided in advance to split
up Irish Distillers' markets and brands, which would violate the
Community's competition law.

<TEXT>
   The nation's trade deficit for the second quarter posted the
biggest improvement in more than five years, narrowing by 14.9
percent, the government reported today.
   The news boosted the dollar on world currency markets. The U.S.
currency was quoted at around 134.35 Japanese yen shortly after the
release of the trade figure, up from 134.11 yen late Tuesday in New
York.
   The dollar had surged Tuesday in spite of continued efforts by
major central banks to restrain it.
   The Commerce Department said a record level of U.S. exports and
the first quarterly decline in imports in three years pushed the
deficit down to $29.9 billion in the second quarter.
   The second-quarter trade gap was down from an imbalance of $35.2
billion in the first three months of the year. Both quarters
represented improvements from a record deficit of $41.2 billion in
the fourth quarter of last year.
   The 14.9 percent narrowing in the deficit represented its
biggest decline since the fourth quarter of 1982, when the
imbalance fell by 18.9 percent.
   The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown
up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The
earlier figures showed a 12.8 percent drop in the deficit to $32.6
billion in the second quarter, compared to $37.4 billion in the
first quarter.
   The drought's impact on consumers was reflected by a government
report Tuesday that indicated grocery prices jumped by 1.4 percent
during July, the biggest monthly increase since early 1984,
although it showed little evidence of accelerating inflation
elsewhere in the economy.
   Excluding food, overall retail prices rose just 0.3 percent for
the month, slower than the pace of the first half of 1987, the
Labor Department reported Tuesday.
   The report reassured bond investors wary of inflationary
pressures, sparking a mild rally in the credit markets. The price
of the Treasury's 30-year bond, one indicator of inflationary
speculation, rose about $5 for every $1,000 in face value, as its
yield fell to 9.38 percent from 9.45 percent late Monday.
   Wall Street failed to follow the bond market, and finished
little changed amid low trading volume. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials, which fell 25.78 points on Monday to reach its lowest
level in nearly three months, dipped another 0.89 point to close at
1,989.33.
   The government also reported that orders for ``big ticket''
durable goods plunged ny 7 percent in July, the biggest drop in
four years, primarily due to huge declines in orders for cars and
to decreased military purchases.
   The decline had been anticipated after durable-goods orders
skyrocketed 8.7 percent in June, the biggest monthly increase in
more than six years.
   In another report, the Labor Department said Americans' average
weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, climbed 0.6 percent
in July, the best showing since a 1.2 percent increase in April.
   The inflation report indicated that, including the
drought-related price spikes for food _ which accounts for about
one-sixth of people's spending _ consumer prices rose 0.4 percent
in July, an annual rate of 5.2 percent.
   ``Despite all the talk about inflationary pressures, it's very
difficult to find much in the way of evidence of it, even with this
huge increase for food,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist for the
Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.
   The higher food prices from the four months of dry weather in
the Farm Belt had been anticipated and, if anything, analysts were
surprised that they were not bigger.
   The 1.4 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 9.6
percent jump in egg costs, a 7.4 percent boost for poultry and a
4.7 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables.

   Stock prices staged a broad advance in light
dealings today after giving ground over the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on
Tuesday and had fallen nearly 38 points since Friday, climbed 16.00
to 2,005.33 after 90 minutes of trading.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 2 to 1 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 755 up, 339 down
and 569 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 42.58 million shares as of 11 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 46.12 million shares at the same point
on Tuesday.
   The market has been trending lower this month in sluggish
trading, and some analysts said the market was due for a rebound.
   Jack Solomon, an analyst for Bear Stearns & Co., said the rise
appeared to reflect a technical reaction to ``the excesssive doom
and gloom'' that has weighed down stock prices for the past few
weeks.
   ``It is a release from excessively consistent selling
pressure,'' he said.
   Investors have generally shown little inclination to buy stocks
because they feel the economy is exanding strongly enough that
inflation may pick up.
   They are concerned that the Federal Reserve would take
additional steps to push interest rates higher if inflation
accelerated.
   Analysts said a government report today that the nation's trade
deficit narrowed in the second quarter also helped stock prices.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Wickes was down [ at
13, Navistar rose [ to 5\, American Express fell ] to 28\ and
International Business Machines rose 1 to 111~.
   The NYSE index was up 0.80 at 146.74. At the American Stock
Exchange, the composite index was up 1.03 at 293.03.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a technical reversal of
Tuesday's mostly lower pattern, analysts said.
   Soybeans led the advance after two days of sharp declines that
saw the contract for September delivery of soybeans plunge a total
of 64 cents to $8.07 a bushel, a 12-week low.
   ``There's a little bargain hunting down here,'' said Joel
Karlin, a research analyst for Chicago-based Research Department
Inc. ``A lot of people are saying the 64-cent fall was overdone.''
   The weather outlook also was supportive for the soybean market,
with some meterologists taking showers out of their weekend
forecasts for the drought-striken Midwest, Karlin said.
   News of corn sales to Taiwan and South Korea gave the corn
market an additional boost, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2{ cents lower to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.87 a bushel; corn
was 2\ cents to 4{ cents higher with September at $2.77{ a bushel;
oats were 3 cents to 6{ cents higher with September at $2.53{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 6{ cents higher with September at
$8.11{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with October at
70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .23 cent
higher with August at 81.65 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower
to .12 cent higher with October at 40.32 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent lower to 1.20 cents higher with August at
37.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Pan Am Says Pension Payment Could Drain Resources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $73 million pension payment due next month from
Pan Am Corp. could leave the ailing airline with limited financial
resources to offset the slow fall and winter travel seasons,
according to government documents.
   Pan Am outlined the problem in documents filed recently with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, The Miami Herald reported in
Wednesday's editions.
   New York-based Pan Am is seeking an Internal Revenue Service
extension for its annual pension contribution due Sept. 15. The
airline also owes an additional $46.1 million from last year's
pension debt.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler told the Herald that the
airline may be forced to sell some assets or obtain wage reduction
agreements from some of its unions in order to offset the payment.
   Members of the largest union at Pan Am, the Transport Workers,
recently rejected a wage freeze agreement that would have saved the
company an estimated $81 million over three years.
   Pan Am had a net loss of $265.3 million last year. Its chairman,
Thomas Plaskett, recently said the airline might sell its Latin
American routes if labor concessions aren't made.

   Tootsie Roll Industries Inc., bidding for a
bigger chunk of the nation's sweet tooth, has announced it is
acquiring one of its competitors, Charms Co. for $65 million in
cash.
   Charms, based in Colts Neck, N.J., manufactures Charms
square-shaped roll candy, Charms hard-candy lolipops and Blo-Pops
candy pops with bubble-gum centers. The company had 1987 sales of
$38 million and pre-tax income of about $3 million, Tootsie Roll
said in a statement.
   ``In the last five or six years, their business has doubled,''
Melvin Gordon, Tootsie Roll's chief executive, said Tuesday. ``The
Blo-Pop is a good, growing segment.''
   The acquisition reflects a ``major commitment'' by Tootsie Roll
to expand its presence in the $7.5 billion-a-year U.S. candy
market, said Ellen Gordon, president of the Chicago-based company.
   Tootsie Roll, maker of Tootsie Rolls, Tootsie Pops, Mason Dots
and Cella's chocolate-covered cherry candies, had 1987 sales of
$115 million and net income of $14.6 million, a 14 percent increase
over its 1986 net income.
   Charms has approved Tootsie Roll's tender offer and its plan to
create a Charms subsidiary, which will remain in New Jersey, Mrs.
Gordon said. The transaction should be completed by Sept. 30, she
said.

   The stock market rallied this morning, moving
higher early in the session and then managing to hold on to most of
the early gains.
   Trading continued at a sluggish pace.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on
Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions, was
up 13.16 at 2,002.49 at noontime. It had been up nearly 17 points
earlier in the day.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 2 to 1 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 803 up, 390 down
and 565 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 59.85 million shares as of noon on
Wall Street compared with 62.63 million shares at the same point on
Tuesday.
   The market has been trending lower this month, and some analysts
said it was due for a rebound.
   Jack Solomon, an analyst for Bear Stearns & Co., said the rise
appeared to reflect a technical reaction to ``the excesssive doom
and gloom'' that has weighed down stock prices for the past few
weeks.
   ``It is a release from excessively consistent selling
pressure,'' he said.
   But Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., noted, ``Nobody is rushing in to buy.''
   He said some of the buying was by traders who had previously
agreed to sell borrowed stocks in expectation that prices were
going lower.
   Investors have generally shown little inclination to buy stocks
because they are fearful that the recent pace of economic expansion
is strong enough that inflation and interest rates are likely to
pick up.
   On Tuesday, the government reported that consumer prices were up
modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled.
   But while the reports sparked a mild rally in bond prices,
stocks failed to follow through. Prices in the bond market were
little changed today.
   Bear Stearns' Solomon said today's stock rally may partly
reflect a delayed reaction to bond price rise over the past few
days, however.
   He said a government report this morning that the nation's trade
deficit narrowed in the second quarter to $29.9 billion from an
imbalance of $35.2 billion in the first three months of the year
also helped the rally.

   Stock prices managed to creep into positive
territory Wednesday, as a strong start on Wall Street pulled London
equities higher.
   However, dealers said activity remained sparse, as many
investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of Thursday's release of
British trade figures for July and the upcoming three-day holiday
weekend in Britain.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 1.3
points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 1,819.2.
   ``We keep dancing around 1,815 to 1,820, but without much
follow-through or direction we're not going to make any headway,
one way or the other,'' said one equity trader.
   Volume was modest with 384.8 million shares changing hands,
compared with 319.2 million shares traded Tuesday.
   Dealers said one large computer-generated program trade
accounted for a substantial portion of Wednesday's volume.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average opened about 2
points better, and then quickly climbed almost 20 points higher
before falling back a bit as the London session drew to a close.

<HEAD>Firm Mapping Out America For Personal Computers Meets With Success</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TROY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long after explorers charted their course by
stars or compass, a computer software pioneer has literally mapped
out a product and a business strategy that is guiding his company
to success.
   The 3-year-old company is MapInfo Corp., which sells a software
package that allows the personal computer user to merge databases
and digital maps of areas within the United States.
   With a couple of keystrokes, the user can place the cursor at a
point on a map displayed on the computer screen and have access to
volumes of information about that point.
   MapInfo can search a database for points within a boundary,
determine latitude and longitude of a point or find an address.
Users can focus in on a 52-foot span of a city block or zoom out to
a 5,000-mile range.
   That may not sound like anything new, says MapInfo President
Sean O'Sullivan with a smile, but his young company claims to be
No.1 in desktop mapping. In fact, he says, there isn't even any
competition _ yet.
   ``These kinds of capabilities have been available on
minicomputers and mainframes before, but it's never been made so
that the common person can use it or it's never been priced so that
the common person can afford it,'' said O'Sullivan, who developed
the company with three other students of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in 1985.
   While some might view MapInfo's product as competition for
mapping via larger computers, it can also complement those methods,
says Thomas Delaney, manager in IBM's geographic and mapping
products department in Kingston, N.Y.
   IBM is on MapInfo's list of customers, and is also a competitor.
   ``The market is not really a market where if you do PC stuff,
you're going to influence mainframes. It really all has to work
together,'' he said.
   Delaney refused to say if IBM, which now is involved in mapping
using mainframes and minicomputers, is developing a program that
would be comparable to MapInfo's.
   So just who uses digital maps and databases on personal
computers?
   Companies or individuals use MapInfo for sales and marketing,
trend analysis, demographic analysis, dispatching and even planning
of routes for optical fiber cables.
   Customers include police departments who want to map out crime
scenes, real estate agents, city planners, cemetery planners,
orange growers and scientists tracking insect populations or AIDS
concentrations.
   ``Even if the job is really large ... and they've (clients) got
their heart set on a larger system, we would recommend MapInfo to
start out with and to train their people, if nothing else,'' said
Mickey Talton, vice president of CAPS Consulting, which works with
the growing market of geographical information systems.
   Based in Tuscaloosa, Ala., CAPS Consulting deals primarily with
urban planning departments and recommends MapInfo frequently
because of its quality, speed with large databases, ease of use and
price, he said.
   ``Smaller cities and smaller government entities can afford to
have this in their offices,'' he said.
   O'Sullivan said sales went from zero to millions within one
year, but he refuses to disclose figures.
   Their customers, which are located in 18 countries, include the
U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service, the U.S. Geological
Survey, American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Chrysler Corp., General
Motors Corp., Chemical Bank and McDonald's Corp.
   This spring, MapInfo won a $250,000 contract with the U.S. Army
to provide mapping software to its recruiting command.
   The system will be used for sales and marketing applications to
help the Army better allocate recruiting personnel.
   ``There's a potential (for MapInfo) to be a $50 (million) to a
$100 million dollar company down the road,'' O'Sullivan said.
   MapInfo came to be when O'Sullivan completed the design of an
electronic map and tracking system for automobiles as part of a
college project. By the time Sullivan graduated in 1985, he and
three other engineers and programmers had joined with business
consultant Michael Marvin and obtained financial backing to launch
the firm.
   The first digital mapping system was unveiled in 1987, the
current version in January 1988.
   The software package costs $750 and digital maps for 300
metropolitan areas in the United States range in price up to $2,000.
   The programs provide names of streets, rivers and bridges, as
well as address number ranges for every block and side of a street.
   Buyers can also use the software with their own maps.
   Because the firm has met with success so far and has been
written about in technical magazines, the threat of competition
always looms.
   ``We always feel like we're running against ghosts,'' said
Marvin, who is MapInfo's chief executive officer.
   An offshoot of the firm called Map Media International was
launched this spring, which uses the MapInfo software and adapts it
to the markets for newspaper and television.
   And at MapInfo, the development staff is always working on the
next version of the mapping system.
   ``This company actually has the chance to be one of the top 10
software companies in the United States, because the market is just
exploding at this point in time,'' O'Sullivan contended.

<HEAD>NYSE Chairman Calls For Common Rules On Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rules against insider trading are so inconsistent
in stock markets worldwide that surveillance officials are having
trouble controlling the illegal practice, the head of New York
Stock Exchange said Wednesday.
   John Phelan, chairman and chief executive officer of the leading
U.S. stock market, called for establishing common definitions of
insider trading on international exchanges in an attempt to combat
unscrupulous traders and reassure the investing public that the
markets aren't rigged.
   ``Everybody comes from different culture and corporate
background,'' Phelan told reporters at the Foreign Correspondent
Club of Japan. ``But the users of those markets have to see those
markets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work in
them.''
   Phelan urged each market to spell out its own definition of what
insider trading is and then work together to set up common rules.
   ``Within the market place, everybody talks the same language,''
he said. ``But if it is perceived by any major participant that the
market is unfair, there will be a lack of use of the market and
that will be detrimental to everybody.''
   Phelan criticized the Japanese approach to insider trading as
``taking a narrow interpretation.'' But he declined to assess
recent measures taken by Japanese securities authorities, saying,
``Their need are different from our needs.''
   Currently several cases of what Western finance experts charge
are insider trading deals _ securities transactions based on
information not available to the public _ are raising questions in
Japan's financial community about the ethics of Japanese stock
deals.
   In the most prominent case, several politicians' aids and senior
journalists admitted to buying stock of a real estate concern
before the issues were made public, and making huge profits by
selling the shares after they were listed.
   Phelan also announced the formation of a new committee to
counsel the NYSE board of directors on Japanese business and
financial matters.
   The Japan Advisory Committee will be chaired by ex-Japanese
Foreign Minister Saburo Okita and vice-chaired by Akio Morita,
chairman of Sony Corp, Phelan said.
   ``Japan's corporate community has become an important partner in
worldwide commerce, and at the same time, Japan is opening the
doors of its financial community to western participants,'' he said.
   The committee is the latest of 11 advisory bodies the exchange
has established. A European Advisory Committee was formed in 1985.
   Phelan credited Japan's efforts to open its financial market to
foreign investors and companies.
   ``When I came here three years ago, what everyone was talking
about was more market access,'' he said. ``And today, more and more
what you hear about are things you hear about in New York and
London _ how to make money, how the market is growing, what new
instruments are coming into the market.''
   He said it is still difficult for U.S. securities firms to
penetrate the Japanese market, but it is equally difficult for
Japanese to break into the U.S. market.
   ``Clearly, it is not easy to penetrate the national market which
was established by domestic insitutions over a period of time,'' he
said. ``But I ... expect to see continuing opening up of the
(Japanese) market because I think it is a Japanese interest to do
so.''

<HEAD>Dollar, Pound End Lower In Choppy European Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An AMs version planned by 5:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished lower against most major
foreign currencies in thin, choppy European trading Wednesday,
pushed down by central bank intervention.
   Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was pushed down by several
spurts of intervention from the central banks of West Germany,
Switzerland and Belgium, but it found strong buying interest at
about 1.8885 West German marks.
   The intervention involved the central banks of fewer countries
than on previous days, dealers said. But they said the central
banks that did intervene made it clear that they didn't want the
dollar above 1.90 marks.
   The pound also slumped, on fears of a deterioration in Britain's
trade deficit.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.6788 from $1.6795 late Tuesday.
It slumped to 3.18 marks from 3.20 marks.
   Dealers say they were increasingly worried that Thursday's
release of British trade figures would show a widening from June's
1 billion-pound, or $1.68 billion, deficit.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8915 West German marks, down from 1.9060; 1.5950 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6055; 6.4250 French francs, down from 6.4635; 2.1370
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,403.50 Italian lire, down from
1,407.50; and 1.2321 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2303.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 134.25 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $433.90 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $432.75. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $433.50 an ounce, compared with $433 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 59 cents to close at a bid $434
an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid price of
$6.81 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.74.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and South Korea expressed regrets Wednesday
over the U.S. trade bill that was signed Tuesday by President
Reagan, saying it has protectionist provisions.
   Reagan called the trade bill a step toward opening worldwide
markets to American products, but expressed displeasure with some
of the provisions.
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he regretted the
trade bill but hopes the U.S. government will implement the law
``in a manner to curb trade protectionism.'' He said previously
that he would ask Reagan to veto the package when the U.S. Congress
passed it earlier this month.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said Japan will promote the Uruguay
Round of trade talks in order to curb protectionist pressures in
the United States.
   Some of the nations that say the bill is protectionist are
themselves accused of being protectionist by the United States.
   Among other measures, the bill transfers authority from the
president to the trade representative to decide on measures to be
taken against what the United States considers unfair trade
practices.
   In South Korea, a Foreign Ministry statement accused the U.S.
trade bill of having ``all the protectionist elements which aroused
so much concern and protest from Korea and many other trading
nations.''
   ``We are particularly concerned with the likely
counter-reactions from U.S. trading partners,'' the statement said,
adding the legislation would encourage enactment of similar laws or
retaliation.
   The South Korean Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. administration
to ensure ``the law be implemented in such a way as not to
adversely affect the smooth growth of the Korea-U.S. trade
relationship.''
   The signing Tuesday climaxed months of negotiations between the
Reagan administration and Congress. Reagan vetoed a previous
measure because it contained a provision requiring a 60-day notice
to employees of plant closings and layoffs. Congress passed the
advance-notice provision as a separate bill, and it became law.
   The United States' record $171 billion trade deficit in 1987 was
a key reason behind congressional action to try to improve the U.S.
standing in the global marketplace.
   Of the overall U.S. trade deficit last year, up from $156.2
billion in 1986, the shortfall with Japan was again the largest at
a record $59.8 billion, up from $58.6 billion in 1986 and $49.7
billion in 1985.
   The deficit with Taiwan was $19.0 billion, up from $7.1 billion
in 1986, and the shortfall with South Korea was $9.9 billion, up
from $7.1 billion in 1986.
   Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura
said, ``I urge the U.S. government, in enforcing this law, to
maintain its policy of protecting free trade and never to give way
to the pressure of protectionists.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Iraq prepares to rebuild from its war
with Iran, companies based in Asia, Western Europe and the United
States are already jostling for what could be some very big
business.
   South Korean businessmen are pouring into Iraq's capital in
hopes of winning orders for major construction projects. Japan is
also expected to be active in seeking business.
   At a recent Baghdad trade fair, 26 U.S. companies had display
stands. And several Western European companies are already at work
on major construction projects.
   Peace negotiations aimed at ending the fighting between Iraq and
Iran open in Geneva on Thursday, five days after a U.N.-sponsored
truce took effect in the 8-year-old conflict.
   ``The South Koreans have been showing vigor and determination to
have the lion's share in Iraq's reconstruction effort,'' said a
diplomat in Baghdad, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi officials have said that they would look favorably on
companies and countries that maintained business with Iraq during
the Gulf war, and which agreed to defer payments and reschedule
debts.
   ``The Koreans have maintained business with Iraq during the hard
times, and deferred major loans until the war came to an end. They
expect the Iraqis to reward them for their loyalty,'' he said.
   Several Western European companies have also continued to do
business with Iraq.
   Britain's Paterson Candy International is helping build a $1
billion irrigation project west of Baghdad, and a West
German-Italian consortium is building the $1.7 billion Saddam dam
on the Euphrates River. Italy's Saipem group has won a $1.4 billion
contract to build an oil pipeline from Iraq across Saudi Arabia.
   When the war started, Iraq was investing its billions of oil
dollars in an ambitious development plan that included steel,
petrochemical, fertilizer and automobile plants and massive water,
road and housing projects.
   Iraq has refused to provide figures on its losses in the war,
either human or economic. But foreign estimates put the cost of
just rebuilding the country's war-damaged transport facilities, oil
installations, housing, factories, schools and hospitals at $30
billion.
   Damage to oil installations alone from Iranian bombing and
shelling attacks has amounted to $8 billion, according to an
estimate by Kiyotaki Tsuji of the Japanese Institute of Middle East
Economic Studies.
   Steel and oil giant USX Corp. plans to sell an idle steel plant
in Baytown, Texas, to Iraq, which wants to dismantle the plant and
ship it home to build pipes for irrigation and oil production. Iraq
reportedly has offered Pittsburgh-based USX $100 million for the
plant, but some Texas congressmen oppose the sale.
   In recent years, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has changed some
of his economic policies, pushing privatization rather than the
socialist central planning and government control that prevailed
before the war.
   Last week, for example, the Iraqi government said the country's
seven major hotels, its biggest restaurants and other tourist
facilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector.
   South Korean companies were the primary contractors for many of
Iraq's suspended projects, including power plants, oil refineries,
highways, pipelines and ports. Immediately after Iraq and Iran
agreed to a cease-fire, South Korea's major construction companies
hastily dispatched their chief executives to Baghdad.
   One ghost from the war hanging around the reconstruction banquet
is Iraq's foreign debt, estimated at $60 billion.
   But since Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's,
foreign businessmen seem ready to overlook this.
   Diplomats said they expect the Iraqis to continue to defer some
of their debts by seeking new credits as they repay old ones.
France, West Germany, Italy and Japan have already rescheduled
billions of dollars in loans to Iraq.
   France, Iraq's second-largest arms supplier after the Soviet
Union, has extended about $5 billion in credit for weapons
purchases.
   A South Korean businessman expressed confidence in Iraq's
postwar economy.
   ``Assuming oil prices hold steady, revenues from oil are
projected to reach around $14 billion this year,'' he said,
speaking on condition he not be identified.
   ``Looking further ahead, the country's revenues could be $20
billion in early 1990,'' he said.
   Some Japanese companies have begun lobbying for major post-war
contracts, raising the prospect of tough competition between the
two Asian powers at the same time that Western European and U.S.
companies are becoming more active in the Iraqi contest.
   The South Korean companies left their offices in Iraq open
during the war and kept their equipment in the country, hoping to
return and do business there.
   ``We have always been able to distinguish between wartime Iraq
... and Iraq of the next century, with its great economic
potential,'' the South Korean businessman said.
   U.S. companies are seeking a big slice of Iraq's reconstruction
pie. The Reagan administration restored financing to Iraq from the
Export-Import Bank last year, after withdrawing it when Baghdad
stopped debt repayments.
   U.S.-Iraqi trade, estimated last year at more than $700 million,
also is expected to swell in the wake of the cease-fire.

   Stock prices were broadly higher this afternoon,
as the market extended the morning's gains in light volume.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on
Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions, was
up 20.98 at 2,010.31 with two hours left in the session.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of more than 2 to 1
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 928 up,
411 down and 549 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 84.44 million shares as of 2 p.m.
on Wall Street compared with 84.81 million shares at the same point
on Tuesday.
   The market has been trending lower this month, and some analysts
said it was due for a rebound.
   Jack Solomon, an analyst for Bear Stearns & Co., said the rise
appeared to reflect a technical reaction to ``the excesssive doom
and gloom'' that has weighed down stock prices for the past few
weeks.
   Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said he detected no rush to buy stocks.
   He said some of the buying was by traders who had previously
agreed to sell borrowed stocks in expectation that prices were
going lower.
   Solomon said a government report this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed in the second quarter to $29.9 billion from
an imbalance of $35.2 billion in the first three months of the year
also helped the rally.
   Among actively-traded issues on the NYSE, Wickes was down \ at

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Prosecution Challenge to Posner's Probation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MILT SOSIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday rejected a prosecution
complaint that probation for millionaire and convicted tax evader
Victor Posner gives the impression that the rich can buy their
freedom while the poor go to prison.
   Posner pleaded no contest in February to overvaluing land he
donated to a college. He received five years probation and a fine
of $4 million after agreeing to donate an additional $3 million to
a program for South Florida's homeless.
   Then-U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner challenged the sentence in
April, arguing that it would ``only emphasize that the rich can
trade money for liberty while the poor cannot.''
   But in a ruling released Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Eugene
P. Spellman, who had sentenced Posner, rejected the prosecution's
arguments. He emphasized that under the probation requirement, the
industrialist must devote 20 hours a week to the homeless project.
   ``Posner may have avoided prison, but his service obligations
will be so personally demanding and time-consuming that he is by no
stretch of the imagination a `free man,''' the judge wrote.
   In 1985 Posner, who runs a 40-company empire valued at $4
billion, was rated the nation's highest-paid executive with an
annual salary of $12.7 million. The judge said he conservatively
calculated that Posner's time was worth $3,200 an hour.
   ``As one of the highest-paid individuals in the United States,
this time commitment alone over five years is worth more than $16
million,'' Spellman wrote.
   ``There is no plausible punishment more reasonably related to
Posner and his crime than to have him roll up his sleeves and
dedicate a substantial part of his life to furthering a vital
charitable cause,'' said the judge.
   The prosecution had specifically attacked the requirement that
Posner donate $3 million to the homeless project, saying that
portion of the sentence was illegal.
   But Spellman noted that Posner had agreed to the donation no
matter what decision was made on the prosecution challenge, and
called the issue moot.
   In recent months Posner has been discussing plans for the
homeless project with a court-approved committee that will oversee
the effort. He has said he envisions a pilot project aimed at
providing homes, perhaps taking advantage of federal subsidies.
   Posner was convicted on 10 tax fraud counts for inflating the
value of land donated to Miami Christian College when writing the
charitable gift off on his income tax return.
   With the time he must spend on the homeless project, Spellman
noted, ``charity will no longer merely mean a tax writeoff to
Victor Posner.''

<HEAD>Guinness To Appeal Takeover Panel Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guinness PLC said Wednesday it will continue to
appeal a ruling by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, which
decided the brewer violated the panel's code of conduct during its
1986 takeover of Distillers Co.
   If the ruling is upheld, Guinness may be required to pay as much
as 100 million pounds, or about $168 million, to former
shareholders of Distillers, maker of Gordon's gin and Johnnie
Walker Scotch whiskey. The ruling already has been upheld by the
British High Court and the Court of Appeal.
   Guinness said it now plans to ask the House of Lords, Britain's
final court of appeal, to consider the regulatory body's ruling.
   The panel ruled last September that a Swiss company, Pipetec AG,
acted in concert with Guinness when it bought Distillers shares
during the final stages of its $4.3 billion takeover battle.
   The purchase gave Guinness more than 15 pecent of Distillers'
shares.
   Under panel rules, a 15-percent holding would have forced
Guinness to make a cash offer to Distillers shareholders at least
equal to the maximum price it paid for Distillers shares over the
previous 12 months.
   Guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for
third parties to buy Guinness shares during the takeover,
apparently to boost the share price and make Guinness'
cash-and-stock offer more attractive than a rival bid.
   Seven men, including former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders,
have been charged with criminal offenses in the case.

<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. said Wednesday its profit soared
five-fold in its first fiscal quarter on the strength of a
``gratifying sales performance'' and success in reducing costs.
   Sony said it earned 16.1 billion yen, or $122 million based on
an exchange rate of 132 yen to the dollar, in the period ended June
30, up from 3.25 billion yen a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 37.2 percent to 463.6 billion yen, or $3.51
billion, from 337.8 billion yen a year earlier.
   The sales gain reflects strong demand in all areas, especially
in Europe and Japan, as well as the addition of sales generated by
the former CBS Records Group, which Sony bought in January.
   The exchange rate used to calculate dollar equivalents was the
one prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

<HEAD>Minnesota Business Dean Named President Of Conference Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preston Townley, 49-year-old dean of the
University of Minnesota's business school, has been selected
president and chief executive of the Conference Board, the research
organization said Wednesday.
   Townley is a noted fund-raiser who led a $40 million campaign at
Minnesota and is president of the Harvard Alumni Association for
the 1988-89 term.
   In an interview, Townley said his goal is to make sure the
Conference Board's activities mesh with the desires of the senior
executives who make up its board of trustees.
   Townley has been dean of Minnesota's Carlson School of
Management since 1984. He helped secure a $25 million gift from
entrepreneur Curtis Carlson to the university, $18 million of which
went to the business school. In turn, the school was named after
Carlson.
   From 1964 to 1983, Townley held a variety of jobs at General
Mills Inc., headquartered in Minneapolis. He has also been active
in raising money for the arts, community organizations and the
Democratic party.
   Townley is to be formally elected by the Conference Board
trustees Sept. 22. He will succeed James T. Mills, who will be 65
in November and has served nearly seven years as president and
chief executive.
   The Conference Board, founded in 1916, is a non-profit,
business-supported research group with a staff of more than 350 in
the United States, Canada and Europe.

<HEAD>Brazil Gets $1.41 Billion Loan from IMF</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday
offered Brazil $1.41 billion in new credits to add to the $120.2
billion the nation is expected to owe at the end of the year.
   U.S. banks hold about $20 billion of Brazil's debt, which is the
biggest in the Third World. The U.S. government holds the biggest
block of shares in the international fund, to which Brazil already
owes $3.08 billion. The fund is owned by 151 countries.
   The government of Brazilian President Jose Sarney, hard hit by
inflation, may draw installments of the fund's ``standby
arrangement'' _ as the new loan is called _ through Feb. 28, 1990.
Under the fund's usual practice, reviews are held after each
installment to decide if the borrower has been performing as agreed
and whether the next installment can be drawn.
   The fund's credits go along with $5.2 billion being offered to
Brazil by banks worldwide to which it already owes about $68
billion. Brazil has 700 creditor banks, which have pledged 95
percent of the additional loans promised. Disbursal of such loans
is often withheld if the fund's disbursements are stopped.
   Interest on old debt already costs Brazil $10.2 billion to $10.4
billion a year. Much of the interest owed to banks was not paid
last year, but some payments have now resumed. The principal has
not been reduced in recent years, as is generally the case with
Third World debt, which is expected to reach a total of more than
$1.2 trillion by the end of the year.
   The fund said Brazil has pledged to cut the government's deficit
in 1988 to 4 percent of the country's gross national product and to
cut it again in 1989. The deficit amounted to 5.5 percent of GNP in
1987. The World Bank calculates that Brazil's total production in
1986 was worth about $250 billion, or $1,810 for each citizen.
   Brazil is promising to cut inflation, according to the fund's
announcement. Figures from Brazil say inflation reached a record
24.04 percent for the month of July and may run close to 1,000
percent for the year. By the fund's calculations, consumer prices
have been rising at an annual rate of about 500 percent in the
first four months of the year.
   The Brazilian government's program, as outlined by the fund,
aims to shrink differences of income among its people, to increase
savings, improve the country's surplus in world trade, reduce
barriers to imports, increase efficiency, reduce government
regulation, privatize state-owned industry and reform the financial
system.
   ``These reforms are expected to ... contribute to foster overall
economic growth,'' the fund said.
   Despite its economic problems Brazil already has one of the best
records for growth in the Western Hemisphere: 4.3 percent annually
for each citizen over the years 1965 to 1986, according to the
World Bank. Growth in the United States as only 1.6 percent over
the same period, but Americans earn almost $10 for every dollar the
average Brazilian makes.

<HEAD>Builder Wants Royalty On Handcrafted House Priced At $685,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home builder Bert Garey thinks of his
work as art, so he's refusing to sell one of his latest creations
unless the buyer agrees to pay a 1 percent royalty.
   The unprecedented proposal is sending new shudders through the
already trembling California realty market, where the median price
for a single-family home has jumped 21.2 percent in the past year
to more than $170,000.
   The home on which Garey wants a royalty is priced at $685,000.
Garey is requesting the 1 percent cut for him or his heirs each
time the house is sold.
   ``Every time a realtor spends two weeks selling a house, he gets
6 percent,'' said Garey. ``I don't see why the person who designed
and built it shouldn't get 1 percent.''
   But real estate attorney Ken Fishbach said the housing market
could be set reeling if the royalty idea catches on.
   ``This has a huge potential to snarl up real estate
transactions,'' he said. Unusual deed restrictions can make it hard
for title companies to provide clear title for properties, he
explained.
   ``It's the kind of thing that only happens in California,''
quipped Ralph Holmer, the Chicago-based chief counsel for the
National Association of Realtors. He said it's the first time he's
heard of an artist's royalty in real estate.
   If builder royalties should become commonplace, many believe it
could only add new fuel to the blazing California realty market.
   The California Association of Realtors reported Wednesday that
the median price of an existing home rose during July to $172,347
in California _ $208,110 in the San Francisco Bay area.
Nevertheless, the number of home sales has risen 8.2 percent in the
past year.
   Garey's homes are priced about 20 percent higher than homes of
comparable size in the area, but the builder still considers them a
bargain. He says the royalty has nothing to do with money.
   ``It's pure ego,'' Garey said. ``I want something that shows my
17-year-old son that I was here ... something to be seen for my
effort.''
   Garey has admired Berkeley's distinctive houses since he was a
19-year-old history and literature student at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   One day about 25 years ago he rode his motorcycle through the
hills and discovered a home under construction by local
designer-builder Judd Boynton. That night, he recalls, he dreamed
about the house and later went to Boynton and said he wanted to buy
it, even though he didn't have any money.
   ``I'm not going to sell it, but I'll teach you to build your
own,'' Boynton replied.
   Since then, Garey has designed and handcrafted 11 homes. He says
he has hoisted every hand-polished beam and hammered every board,
usually with the help of just one assistant. He also says he has
done the wiring, set the tile, caulked the windows and installed
the plumbing.
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``It's like sculpting on a large scale.''
   A brochure describes the home for which Garey wants a royalty as
``timeless architecture ... not a style but an attitude ... a
living sculpture of form and feeling, light and view, redwood and
mahogany.''
   So far, there has been no taker for the four-bedroom house in
the Berkeley hills with a spectacular view of the Golden Gate
Bridge.

   The stock market pushed ahead broadly this
afternoon, extending the morning's gains as the session wore on.
   Trading remained relatively slow, however.

said it was due for a rebound.

   Solomon said a government report this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed in the second quarter to $29.9 billion from
an imbalance of $35.2 billion in the first three months of the year
also helped the rally.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The corn market led grain and soybean futures to
a sharply higher close Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
partly on fears of a freeze this weekend in the Midwest.
   Analysts were skeptical of the frost talk, which helped drive
corn futures prices up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a
bushel.
   ``I find it hard to believe with all the hot weather we've
had,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller & Co., a
Chicago-based division of the British-owned trading company LIT
America Inc.
   He called the freeze talk ``crazy'' but acknowledged that some
meteorologists have predicted an early frost, which would do
further damage to corn and soybeans already damaged by the
summer-long drought.
   Crop futures also advanced on perceptions that rain was slowing
the wheat harvest in the Soviet Union, possibly reducing the amount
of wheat that will be harvested there, Gidel said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 7{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.91 a bushel; corn was 3}
cents to 10 cents higher with September at $2.83} a bushel; oats
were 5 cents to 6{ cents higher with September at $2.53{ a bushel;
soybeans were 16 cents to 26{ cents higher with September at $8.31
a bushel.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. said Wednesday it plans
to export 100,000 Tennessee-made microwave ovens to Europe by the
end of 1989.
   The U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sharp Corp. said the ovens, made
in Memphis, Tenn., will be shipped to 11 European countries: West
Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Austria,
Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Britain.
   The Memphis plant, Sharp's only U.S. factory, produces about
90,000 color televisions and 65,000 microwave ovens a month. In
addition, it began making personal computers in January.
   The company said it is studying the possible export of other
American-made products to Europe and Asia.

   A late-afternoon surge helped the stock market
post a big gain today, as stocks regained some ground lost over the
past three sessions.
   Trading remained relatively slow, however.
   The market has fallen fairly steadily this month, and some
analysts said it was due for a rebound.
   Jack Solomon, an analyst for Bear Stearns & Co., said the rise
appeared to reflect a technical reaction to ``the excesssive doom
and gloom'' that has weighed down stock prices for the past few
weeks.
   Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said he detected no rush by big investors to
buy stocks.
   He said some of the rise could be attributed to buying by
traders who had previously agreed to sell borrowed stocks,
expecting prices were going lower.
   Solomon said a new government report that the nation's trade
deficit narrowed in the second quarter to $29.9 billion from $35.2
billion in the first three months of the year may have encouraged
some stock buying by taking some pressure off the Federal Reserve
to push interest rates higher.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mars candy-bar clan is worth $12.5 billion,
surpassing the Newhouse publishing dynasty as the richest family in
America, Fortune magazine reports.
   If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could
buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end
to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times.
   The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of
the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about
itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&Ms.
   ``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is
as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA,''
Fortune said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988
Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on
newsstands next Monday.
   The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on
what comparable food concerns have sold for recently.
   ``Thus, Forrest Mars and his three children, Forrest Jr., John
and Jacqueline, overtake the Newhouse publishing magnates as the
richest Americans,'' Fortune said.
   Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The
richest remains the Sultan of Brunei, whose oil wealth makes him
worth $25 billion. Next is King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and family,
worth $18 billion.
   Fourth is Britain's Queen Elizabeth II with $8.7 billion; next
is the Newhouses, whose communications holdings are worth $8
billion; in sixth place is retail king Sam Walton, founder of
Wal-Mart stores, and family, worth $7.4 billion; seventh is
Canada's Reichmann family, with $6.3 billion in assets that range
from swank New York real estate to interests in railroads and
utilities.
   Eighth is Kenneth Irving and family, a Canadian clan that owns
400 companies worth $6.2 billion; ninth is Kenneth Thomson and
family, Canadian owners of a publishing, retailing, energy and real
estate empire worth $6 billion; and in 10th place is Gerald
Grosvenor and family, British land barons worth $5.4 billion.
   Of the 129 individuals and nuclear families that comprise this
year's list, there are 51 in the United States, 38 in Europe, 19 in
Asia _ including 12 Japanese _ 13 Arabs and eight others, Fortune
said.

<HEAD>Ashland, Former Executives Settle</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with four grafs to UPDATE with Ashland taking
fourth-quarter charge against earnings</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. said Wednesday it would
take an after-tax charge of about $25 million in its fiscal fourth
quarter to cover the cost of settling a lawsuit brought by two
former executives.
   Company spokesman Roger Schrum said the charge against earnings
would amount to about 22 cents per share in the three months ended
Sept. 30.
   The announcement came after Ashland reached a settlement in
principle to pay $25 million to the former executives who claimed
they were fired for refusing to offer or cover up bribes to foreign
officials.
   U.S. District Judge William O. Bertelsman, who announced the
arrangement Tuesday in the four-year legal battle, said he had
picked the figure and applied ``constructive pressures'' on each
side to accept it.
   An eight-week jury trial of the case in Covington ended June 10
with a $69.5 million decision again Ashland, the biggest ever
verdict in Kentucky. Ashland later sought a new trial or a
different judgment.
   The jury award included damages for lost past and future wages
of $14.4 million for former vice president Bill McKay and $7.7
million for former vice president Harry Williams.
   Those amounts were tripled because of a finding that Ashland
violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by
engaging in a pattern of illegal interstate activity to obtain oil
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   In addition, Ashland Chairman John R. Hall, Senior Vice
President Richard Spears and the company were assessed a total of
$3 million in punitive damages for their treatment of the two men.

<HEAD>Dollar Sinks; Gold Higher</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar sank Wednesday with a slight push
from a few central banks after having resisted concerted official
efforts to lower it in previous sessions.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $434.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $431.85
an ounce late Tuesday.
   Traders said the market was influenced by an article in
Wednesday's editions of the New York Times that quoted an unnamed
senior U.S. official as saying the Reagan administration believes a
further rise of the dollar could be troublesome.
   Also, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita reportedly said the
dollar's recent rise against the West German mark was
``inexplicable.''
   Further undermining the dollar was a sale of hundreds of
millions of British pounds for West German marks, said Jerry Egan,
a senior trader for the Bank of Boston. He said the trade was done
by selling sterling for dollars and then selling dollars for marks.
The result was to lower the dollar against the mark, starting a
slide.
   The dollar's fall was fairly steady. Most times when the dollar
is falling it stages periodic rallies, or bounces, but Wednesday
``it was bouncing like a dead cat,'' Egan said.
   Currency dealers in Europe said there were spurts of
intervention by the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland and
Belgium.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.6788 from $1.6795 late Tuesday,
influenced by fears that Britain would report a bigger trade
deficit Thursday. But later in New York it rose to $1.6869 from
$1.6740 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 134.25 yen. Later in New York, the dollar fell to
133.83 yen from 134.11 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8820 West German marks, down from 1.9128; 1.5855 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6102; 1.2339 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2308; 6.3960
French francs, down from 6.4895; and 1,396.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,415.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8915
West German marks, down from 1.9060; 1.5950 Swiss francs, down from
1.6055; 6.4250 French francs, down from 6.4635; 2.1370 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,403.50 Italian lire, down from
1,407.50; and 1.2321 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2303.
   Gold prices rose late in the trading day in reaction to the
weakness of gold. Gold's dollar price becomes cheaper for foreign
investors when the dollar's exchange rate falls.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 59 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid
$434 an ounce.
   Later, gold rose in London to a late bid price of $433.90 a troy
ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $432.75. In Zurich, gold closed
at a bid $433.50 an ounce, compared with $433 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $434.90 a troy ounce from $432.20 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid price of
$6.81 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.74. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $6.782 a troy
ounce from $6.730 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The aluminum industry's bid for early labor
contract settlements failed Wednesday in Cincinnati, where
bargaining ended in disagreement over economic issues.
   Pittsburgh-based Aluminum Co. of America, the industry leader,
and Reynolds Metals Co. of Richmond, Va., opened talks Aug. 9 with
the United Steelworkers of America and the Aluminum, Brick and
Glass Workers.
   About 21,000 members of the two unions will continue working
under two-year contracts that don't expire until May 1989. Since
the two sides reached an impasse in the early talks they planned to
reopen the bargaining nearer the expiration date.
   ``The problem was that what they came up with on profit sharing
was very inadequate,'' said USW spokesman Charles Robb in
Pittsburgh.
   Alcoa offered to give union members a share of only those
profits that exceeded 6 percent of the value of its U.S. assets,
and Reynolds offered a share of those profits exceeding 10 percent
of shareholders' equity, he said.
   Under those proposals, ``In 1987, Reynolds' biggest profit year,
they would have shared slightly more than $600 per worker, and
Alcoa would have shared nothing,'' Robb said.
   Combined with other provisions, the companies' offers would have
represented hourly wage increases projected at 37 cents, he said.
   ``Our members gave up about 95 cents an hour in the current
contract,'' Robb said. ``Certainly we want our members to recoup
what they had given up since the companies are tremendously
profitable.''
   ``We offered both unions a four-year agreement featuring a
profit-sharing plan, an immediate insurance option and increased
pension benefits,'' said Alcoa Chairman Paul O'Neill.
   Alcoa reported 1987 profits of $200 million on sales of $7.77
billion and 1988 first-half profits of $416.3 million on sales of
$4.59 billion.
   Reynolds reported 1987 net earnings of $219.5 million on sales
of $4.32 billion and 1988 first-half profits of $204.9 million on
sales of $2.65 billion.
   The Pittsburgh-based USW represents about 4,000 Reynolds
employees at 21 locations in the United States and Canada and about
6,000 Alcoa employees at nine locations in the United States. The
ABGW represents about 4,000 Reynolds workers and about 7,000 Alcoa
workers.
   The two unions negotiate side-by-side on separate contracts.

   The nation's automakers Wednesday reported a 13.2
percent dip in their mid-August sales of cars and trucks, but
analysts attributed much of the drop to the curtailment of buyer
incentives.
   ``Incentives were just coming in last year and there are no new
incentive programs right now,'' said analyst David Healy of the
investment firm Drexel Brunham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``So
Americans are buying the things.''
   The latest sales report, covering the Aug. 11-20 period, is
compared with daily sales from the same period a year ago.
   General Motors Corp.'s share of the U.S. market slipped during
the period to 46.4 percent, down from 54.3 percent during the same
period last year.
   Meantime, Ford Motor Co. boosted its share from 28.6 percent to
31.6 percent, and Chrysler Corp. increased its piece of the
industry's pie from 11.2 percent during mid-August 1987 to 13.6
percent during the same period this year.
   ``Chrysler and Ford seem to be eating GM's lunch,'' Healy said.
   Overall, car makers in the United States reported selling
298,580 cars and trucks during the nine selling days of this year,
compared with 343,845 vehicles bought during the same period last
year, when there also were nine selling days.
   For the month so far, car and truck sales were off 10 percent,
from 607,125 in 1987 to 578,643 this year. Domestic and foreign
automakers report sales for all of August in early September.
   Car makers offered some of their most attractive incentives last
year. But this year, as inventories have shrunk, automakers have
been less likely to offer special incentive plans.
   The car makers reported that for the year, sales of U.S.-made
cars and trucks are up 8 percent, from 7,092,789 last year to
7,699,649.
   Each of the Big Three reported dips in car sales during
mid-August, compared with the same period last year.
   General Motors Corp. said it sold 88,394 cars this year, down
30.3 percent from 126,887 during the incentive-bloated period last
year. Ford Motor Co. reported a 10 percent drop in sales to 60,184
from 66,907 a year earlier.
   Chrysler Motor Co. showed the smallest decrease, dropping 0.8
percent from 26,200 cars in mid-August 1987 to 25,985 during the
period this year.
   Meantime, Honda North America Inc. said it sold 9,259 cars
during mid-August of this year compared with 7,563 cars in the same
period last year _ a 22.4 percent increase.
   Nissan Motor Corp. USA's sales fell 4.5 percent during the
period from 4,380 cars in mid-August 1987 to 4,182 in the same
period this year. Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. reported sales of
1,429 cars during the period this year compared with 1,188 last
year, an increase of 20.3 percent.

<HEAD>Drought Concerns Turn To Fears Of Early Freeze In Futures Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears that frost could nip the Corn Belt as early as this
weekend helped send corn and soybean futures prices sharply higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat and oats also
advanced.
   On other markets, coffee, livestock, precious-metals and
stock-index futures all rose while energy futures finished mostly
lower.
   Meteorologists and grain analysts were skeptical of the
Midwestern frost talk, which helped drive Chicago corn futures
prices up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' said James Roemer, a meteorologist
and commodities adviser for Freese-Notis Weather Inc. and Weather
Trades Inc., both of Des Moines, Iowa.
   ``There's going to be some 30s and 40s in parts of Michigan and
parts of the Great Lakes region so it'll be cool for the weekend
and then we'll be warming up again next week,'' he said.
   National Weather Service meteorologist Jane Hollingsworth in
Chicago predicted lows in the 40s this weekend in the Northern
Plains and Great Lakes region ``but it doesn't look like there's
any indications right now for freezing temperatures in the
Midwest,'' she said.
   The National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperatures
and below-normal rainfall for the Midwest next week.
   Roemer said early frosts _ early meaning September _ followed
two of the last four summer droughts, in 1974 and 1983.
   He said the early freeze in 1974 wiped out a large part of the
soybean crop but added that this year's crops were maturing at an
above-average pace, so frost would have to occur no later than
Sept. 20 to cause significant damage.
   Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller & Co., a Chicago-based
division of the British-owned trading company LIT America Inc.,
called the freeze talk ``crazy.''
   ``I find it hard to believe with all the hot weather we've
had,'' he said.
   Crop futures also advanced on perceptions that rain was slowing
the wheat harvest in the Soviet Union, possibly reducing the amount
of wheat that will be harvested there, Gidel said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 7 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.90} a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 10
cents higher with September at $2.83} a bushel; oats were 5 cents
to 6} cents higher with September at $2.54 a bushel; soybeans were
12 cents to 27{ cents higher with September at $8.31{ a bushel.
   Coffee futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange on continuing concerns about dry weather in Brazil, the
world's leading coffee producer and exporter.
   Coffee settled 2.91 cents to 5.46 cents higher with September at
$1.2668 a pound.
   Unexpectedly strong demand for beef by retailers boosted cattle
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while strong cash hog
markets helped to push the pork futures higher, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .83 cent higher with October at
71.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to 1.05 cents
higher with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.40 cent higher with October at 40.47 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with August at
37.97 cents a pound.
   Precious metals rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
mostly technical factors with the inflationary implications of the
weaker dollar providing additional support, said Jack Barnanel,
director of futures trading for Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $2.80 higher with October at $438.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.4 cents higher with September
at $6.79 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced sharply in a technically motivated,
late-afternoon surge on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the
contract for delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled
4.45 points higher at 261.75.
   Most energy futures slipped lower in lethargic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 7 cents
lower with October at $15.68 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent to
.39 cent lower with September at 43.75 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .25 cent lower to .33 cent higher with September at
47.51 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Quarterly Trade Deficit Shrinks, Stocks Up, Auto Sales Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America's bulging trade deficit shrank 15 percent in the
April-June quarter, the government said Wednesday in a report that
strengthened Republican campaign claims of economic achievement but
didn't impress financial markets.
   Although the Commerce Department figures showed the biggest
quarterly improvement in more than five years, the dollar fell and
bonds weakened. The stock market rallied, but trading was light and
brokers attributed the gain to internal market influences that had
little to do with the general economy.
   The Commerce Department said the difference between what America
spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of $29.9 billion in
the second quarter, compared with a deficit of $35.2 billion in the
first three months of 1988.
   Many economists regard the trade deficit as one of the most
visible weaknesses in the economy, reflecting a relentless
addiction to cheap imports and consequent difficulty for domestic
companies trying to compete. Democrats have attempted to make the
trade deficit an issue in the presidential campaign.
   But the improvement reported Wednesday suggested that U.S.
manufacturers are making strong gains in selling abroad. Some
economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by close to
25 percent for the year as a whole, marking the first annual
improvement since President Reagan took office.
   Republicans are hoping voters will focus on the improvement,
which has already shown up in the Commerce Department's monthly
merchandise trade reports.
   But on Wall Street, the trade news was largely disregarded and
the volume of trading remained low. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks, which had lost nearly 38 points over the
previous three sessions, climbed 37.34 to close at 2,026.67 in what
brokers described as a technical recovery.
   In foreign-exchange trading the dollar, which ordinarily would
be expected to rally on improved U.S. trade figures, fell with a
slight push from selling by a few central banks concerned about its
recent rise.
   Traders said the currency market was influenced by an article in
Wednesday's editions of the New York Times that quoted an
unidentified senior U.S. official as saying the Reagan
administration believes a further rise of the dollar could be
troublesome.
   The dollar's decline was partly responsible for a poor showing
in the bond market, where traders are sensitive to changes in the
value of the U.S. currency because it directly affects the demand
for U.S. bonds by foreigners.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell about $2.50 per $1,000 in
face amount and its yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to
9.39 percent from 9.37 percent late Tuesday.
   In other economic news, major automakers said mid-August sales
of U.S.-made cars and trucks fell by 13.2 percent from the same
period a year earlier, when sales were inflated by buyers taking
advantage of dealer incentives.
   Companies making cars in the United States reported selling
298,580 cars and trucks during the Aug. 11-20 period this year,
compared with 343,845 vehicles during the same period last year.

   NCNB Texas National Bank depositors have withdrawn
about $300 million from the bank in recent weeks, and bank
officials say the total could double.
   ``We're concerned _ but only because we would like to hang on to
every deposit and customer we can,'' said Timothy Hartman, NCNB's
vice chairman.
   Hartman said Tuesday the withdrawals apparently reflect concern
about the approaching end of a guarantee on deposits above $100,000
and the loss of additional deposit insurance that was available
through the 40-bank system of NCNB Texas' predecessor, First
RepublicBank Corp.
   In late July, NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., acquired the
former banks of First RepublicBank from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. NCNB agreed to invest up to $240 million for the
130 Texas banking locations of First RepublicBank, which was
declared insolvent.
   NCNB initially will acquire a 20 percent stake in the bank but
has an option to buy the rest from the FDIC, which promised to pump
$4 billion into the Texas institution.
   ``I don't know if it is possible to find a more sound
institution anywhere,'' Hartman said.
   Under terms of an agreement announced July 29, the FDIC planned
to withdraw the additional coverage for deposits above $100,000
that it installed in March to halt a run on First RepublicBank.
   The move does not affect the normal coverage of up to $100,000
offered to depositors at all federally insured institutions.
   Hartman said NCNB has alternative sources of funding _ including
$3 billion in cash due from the FDIC as part of the transaction _
and faces no cash squeeze because of withdrawals.
   In fact, NCNB expects withdrawals to total as much as $600
million, about 10 percent of the $6 billion in the $100,000-plus
accounts the bank maintains.
   Hartman said depositors apparently had grown accustomed to the
luxury of multibank insurance, a program through which customers
could spread their deposits among several First RepublicBank
institutions for additional FDIC protection.

   A young computer whiz pleaded innocent
Wednesday to 11 counts of felony larceny stemming from an alleged
scheme to bilk six investors out of more than $500,000 to keep his
business operating.
   Tex Zachary Hildreth, 24, faces a maximum penalty of five years
in prison or a $25,000 fine and two years in jail on each charge if
convicted. He was ordered held in lieu of $100,000 bail at the
local jail.
   Hildreth, who fled to New Hampshire and attempted suicide with
his mother after authorities and creditors moved in on his software
firm Massdata Corp., had been free on $1,000 bail during a
two-month-long grand jury investigation.
   Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Andrew Gill Meyer approved
the prosecution's recommendation that bail for Hildreth be
increased because more indictments are expected in the case.
   Defense attorney Gregory Sullivan said he would ask during a
bail review hearing Thursday that Hildreth be allowed to post
$5,000 to $10,000 cash bail, which would be returned when he
appeared for trial, instead of paying a surety bond as requested,
which would not be returned.
   Mike McGorty, spokesman for the Norfolk County district
attorney's office, said Assistant District Attorney Dennis Mahoney
told the judge that Hildreth orchestrated ``a scheme of grand
proportion'' to get people to invest in his company.
   Mahoney, head of the county's white collar crime unit, told the
court Hildreth obtained loans by telling investors of a phantom
family trust that he would use to pay back their inestments.
   Hildreth told investors he would soon be eligible for funds from
the trust left to him when his father died, he said. But
investigators determined that Hildreth's father is still alive and
that the trust never amounted to more than $30,000.
   As Massdata slid into the red, Hildreth also allegedly used
falsified documents to obtain bank loans.
   ``As part of the investigation, we determined that certain banks
made loans based on papers presented by Mr. Hildreth and the
documents were allegedly fictitious or forgeries,'' McGorty said.
   ``This could stretch well beyond a million dollars,'' McGorty
said.
   The grand jury is also looking into a $400,000 loan to Hildreth
from the Rockland Trust Co.
   ``It appears that some of this money was being solicited to pay
off other investors and also some bank notes,'' McGorty said.
   After Hildreth and his mother, Rose, 50, fled Massachusetts with
creditors close behind, they were recaptured when an employee at
the Manchester, N.H., Holiday Inn reported a bloodied man wandering
about the lobby.
   Police found Hildreth, who apparently had slashed his wrists.
His mother and a bottle of non-prescription pills were found in
their hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes,
police said.
   Hildreth bought his first computer at the age of 16 and, with
the help of a mentor, rented office space to start his own software
firm at the age of 20.
   He quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success, including
a $220,000 Weymouth condominium, a $32,000 BMW, and a 50-inch,
$4,000 color TV.

<HEAD>MCCA Shareholders Approve Merger with BellSouth Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stockholders of Mobile Communications
Corp. of America approved Wednesday the $676 million merger of the
Jackson-based company's local paging and cellular telephone
operations into BellSouth Corp., MCCA officials announced.
   The merger agreement provides that other MCCA operations _
including nationwide paging, air-to-ground and marine
communications and telephone answering services _ will be spun off
into a new publicly held company, according to a news release
issued by MCCA. The as yet unnamed new company also will be based
in Jackson.
   BellSouth reported revenues of $12.27 billion in 1987, up 7.2
percent from 1986. The latest figures for MCCA show revenues of
$93.6 million for 1987, up from $70.8 million for 1986.
   The merger and spin-off will become effective as soon as federal
and state regulatory and judicial approvals have been received.
MCCA Chairman John N. Palmer, who will be chairman of the new
spinoff company, said he expected all required federal and state
approvals to be received by late in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   MCCA shareholders will receive the equivalent of $28.75 in
BellSouth stock and one share in the new spinoff company for each
share of Class A or Class B MCCA stock held, he said. Since there
are about 23.5 million shares outstanding, the value of the
BellSouth stock is about $676 million.
   The new company's primary operating subsidy will be National
Satellite Paging, a nationwide paging and voice mail system
headquartered in Washington, D.C.
   MCCA provides personal mobile communications services in 100
cities and 34 states and the District of Columbia.

   Stock prices surged Wednesday, bouncing back
from levels last seen nearly three months ago in a rally that
gathered momentum toward the finish. Trading volume, however,
remained sluggish.
   Analysts said the market had been due for a rebound after this
month's steady decline. But they said some encouraging news on the
trade deficit and some bargain-hunting also contributed to the
rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on
Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions,
climbed 37.34 points to close at 2,026.67, its biggest gain in
nearly a month. Tuesday's close had left the market's best-known
indicator at its lowest level since late May.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5-to-2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,089 issues up, 376 down and 498 unchanged. The NYSE index rose
1.99 to 147.93.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.80 million shares,
up from 119.54 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
151.27 million shares.
   Prices rose smartly for the first hour of trading, pulled back
somewhat at midday and then extended their gains during the early
afternoon. A 12-point spurt in the final hour of trading lifted the
Dow Jones industrial average to its biggest gain since a 46.40 rise
on July 29.
   Jack Solomon, an analyst for Bear Stearns & Co., said a
combination of factors helped lift prices.
   He said this month's decline had soured the market's mood, and
Wednesday's activity reflected ``a release from excessively
consistent selling pressure.''
   He said some investors may have found soem bargains at their
depressed levels, while professional traders who had previously
sold borrowed stocks, expecting prices to fall, decided to buy
stocks.
   Solomon said the stock rally may have also reflected a delayed
reaction to Tuesday's government reports that consumer prices were
up modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled.
   He said a new government report that the nation's trade deficit
narrowed in the second quarter to $29.9 billion from an imbalance
of $35.2 billion in the first three months of the year may also
have provided some encouragement.
   All three reports were seen as reducing pressure on the Federal
Reserve to push interest rates higher, he said.
   ``If we get some good political or economic news, this rally may
continue. We may have broken the backbone of the decline,'' Solomon
said.
   But other analysts noted the gains came in continued slow
trading, and were skeptical about prospects for further gains.
   ``This seems to be feeding on itself a little bit,'' said Bill
Raftery, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``I don't
think it means a turning point in the market.''
   Wickes was the most actively-traded stock on the NYSE, slipping
[ to 13. Its management has proposed a leveraged buyout at $12 a
share.
   International Business Machines was the second most active
issue, climbing 1~ to 112}. Other point-plus gainers included
Boeing, up 2[ to 58}; Dow Chemical, up 1} to 83, and Philip Morris,
up 2\ to 91}.
   The automobile stocks rose despite reporting lower sales in
mid-August compared with a year earlier. Ford Motor rose 1| to 49,
General Motors rose } to 73 and Chrysler was up ] at 22].
   Some airline issues were strong gainers. UAL, parent of United
Airlines, jumped 2] to 90[, while AMR Corp. rose 1] to 43\, Delta
Airlines was up } to 46} and NWA Inc. rose } to 43].
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, rose $32.37 billion, or 1.26 percent, to
$2.606 trillion.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 4.91 to 299.50, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 4.04 at 261.13.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.06
to 294.06. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 376.03, up 2.50.

   The president of Colombia's state oil
company Ecopetrol was fired Wednesday because of disagreements with
the minister of mines and energy, Oscar Mejia Vallejo.
   Mejia, in a news release, said Jose Chona was ousted because
``there was a mutual lack of trust'' between the two men.
   He did not elaborate on the disagreements, although he
criticized as too costly Chona's plans to build an $800 million
refinery. Mejia also accused Chona of refusing to allow Ecopetrol
profits to be used for helping economically depressed areas.
   Andres Restrepo, a former minister of development, was appointed
as Chona's replacement.

<HEAD>Court Approves $14 Million State Bailout for CM&W Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge approved Wednesday a
$14 million state bailout of the Chicago, Missouri & Western
Railway.
   Citicorp and Heller Financial Inc., which are owed more than
$100 million by the railroad, had opposed the rescue plan and
sought to have the railroad shut down and its assets sold.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John Schwartz said in a written
decision that the public interest required the railroad to continue
to operate while its court-appointed trustee, Daniel R. Murray,
works out a reorganization plan.
   ``The history of this railroad, the lenders' relationship to it,
as well as the history of this case, demand this opportunity be
given to the trustee if the public interest is not to be damned,''
Schwartz concluded.
   A spokeswoman for Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, who put
together the rescue package of grants and loans, applauded the
decision to keep the CM&W running.
   The creditors' attorney, Neal Wolf, was out of his office and
not immediately available for comment.
   The railroad operates freight service over its entire 632-mile
line between Kansas City, Mo., and Joliet, with trackage rights
extending the final 40 miles to Chicago.
   The 157-mile Amtrak route between Joliet and Springfield is used
by 300,000 people annually, according to Thompson's office.
   The creditors had argued that even under the best of
circumstances, the railroad's earnings would not come close to
paying even the interest on the loans.
   CM&W filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws on April 1, listing debts of $131.8 million
and assets of $103.5 million.
   On July 29, Schwartz allowed CM&W to accept $1 million of the
proposed bailout to keep the railroad rolling through the
completion of bankruptcy proceedings.

<TEXT>
   There is no snap, crackle or pop to Kellogg
Co.'s claim that B-vitamins in its Rice Krispies cereal provide
pep, and the company has agreed to stop some of its advertising on
the claim, New York's attorney general said Wednesday.
   Kellogg, of Battle Creek, Mich., agreed Aug. 4 to stop all
advertising in New York that might mislead consumers about the
health benefits of Rice Krispies, said state Attorney General
Robert Abrams.
   Kellogg's ads had claimed B-vitamins in Rice Krispies would give
consumers added physical energy, vigor and power, and also asserted
that fatigue was due to lack of these vitamins, Abrams said.
   Of the five B-vitamins contained in Rice Krispies, three _
thiamin, riboflavin and niacin _ are known to help convert food
into the type of energy needed by the body's cells, Abrams said.
But there is no evidence that eating Rice Krispies has an effect on
a person's energy level or feeling of well-being, he said.
   Studies have shown B-vitamins are readily available in the
American diet and the majority of consumers who suffer from fatigue
do not have any primary vitamin deficiency, Abrams said in a
statement.
   The attorney general obtained a formal ``assurance of
discontinuance'' from Kellogg on Aug. 4, stating the company would
not use any advertising or labeling that might lead consumers to
believe B-vitamins added to Rice Krispies provide energy or relieve
fatigue.
   The company admitted no liability but paid $10,000 toward the
cost of New York's investigation.
   A recording at Kellogg's Battle Creek headquarters said the
offices were closed Wednesday afternoon.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based public advocacy group, applauded the attorney
general's efforts. CSPI brought the Rice Krispies health claim to
New York's attention last October.

<TEXT>
   Offers of food, lodging, money and
equipment continued to pour in Wednesday for a group of Iowa
farmers who have come to Idaho to cut free hay for their
drought-starved livestock.
   Meanwhile, organizers of the hay harvest said they've received
calls from farmers and farmer groups in North Dakota, Minnesota and
Iowa asking whether there was enough hay to feed their livestock as
well.
   ``When we put out the notice, we didn't realize we were going to
get such a tremendous response,'' said Mike Tracy, director of
information for the Idaho Farm Bureau. ``It's turned into a
monumental task.''
   Organizers of the hay harvest had worried there wouldn't be
enough machinery to keep the Iowans busy, but offers of equipment
began pouring into the Farm Bureau office here Tuesday after a Farm
Bureau official appealed on television for donations.
   Tracy said the 64 Iowans would begin cutting hay on Thursday.
   The tired contingent Iowans arrived late Tuesday in two
Greyhound buses donated by the transportation company for the
1,600-mile trip west.
   The men, women and teen-agers stayed overnight in rooms donated
by three motels while Farm Bureau and National Farmers Organization
officials scouted about 4,500 acres of hay on pasture land placed
in the government's Conservation Reserve Program.
   ``They really like what they're seeing,'' Tracy said. ``They're
real pleased with the quality.''
   The harvest could provide as much as 5,000 tons of hay. As of
the first of this week, 76 percent of the hay crop in Iowa was
considered in poor condition by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   The Iowans, who plan to harvest, bail and ship for about 10
days, faced an Aug. 31 deadline to be off the reserve lands, which
are under the control of the USDA.
   ``A lot of us guys are just plain out of hay,'' said Don
Tibbals, an Albia, Iowa, dairy farmer. ``The USDA finally realized
that and released the conservation reserve program lands.''
   ``A lot of farmers are feeding their winter hay now,'' said
Junior McCall of Clarinda, Iowa. ``We usually don't have to start
(feeding) hay until December,'' added Larry Keller of Nunia, Iowa.
   The Iowans will cut mostly grasses planted to prevent erosion on
the reserve lands in northern and eastern Latah County, about 30
miles east of Moscow, Tracy said.
   The hay is to be shipped back to Iowa on rail cars donated by
the Burlington Northern Railroad.
   Details were still being worked out on getting the hay to
loading points and how it will be distributed when it arrives in
the Midwest, said McCall, who made the trip with his son, Jeff.
   ``Hopefully, it will be dropped off at different spots,'' he
said.
   Help for the Iowa farmers came from fraternities at the
University of Idaho and Washington State University, which have
offered to help harvest the hay, as did Future Farmers of America
and other farm organizations, Tracy said.
   Local restaurants and Granges have donated food to feed the
field workers. Three banks in Chariton, about 45 miles south of Des
Moines, put up cash for meals along the way.
   ``We haven't had to pay for anything yet,'' said Keller.
   Norman Plank, an Idaho Farm Bureau official, estimated 200
boxcar loads of hay might be moved.
   The 4,500 acres could be expected to produce about 5,000 tons of
hay, said Dan Harwood of Colfax, Wash., a National Farmers
Organization representative.

<HEAD>Investors Flock To `How To' Seminar on Thrift Investment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financiers who have acquired troubled
savings and loans told a capacity crowd of high-stakes investors
Wednesday that the thrift industry is the investment ``bonanza'' of
the next decade.
   More than 350 investors packed a conference room at the Fairmont
Hotel to hear three nationally-known investors share their insight
on how to make money buying into the beleaguered thrift industry.
   The daylong event was sponsored by the Federal Home Loan Bank of
San Francisco, which hopes to lure investors with at least $1.5
million to spare into purchasing an ailing thrift.
   ``This will be your bonanza in the next decade _ lucky you,''
said Preston Martin, chairman of Wespar Financial Services Inc. and
former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
   Martin, who is involved in several investment groups, including
that of former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, appeared
with investment banker Alan E. Rothenberg and Stephen T. McLin,
president of San Francisco's America First Financial Corp.
   The panel members are touting thrift investment because they say
the competition will help their own businesses thrive and will
improve the health of the whole industry.
   ``It's important to get this problem solved,'' said McLin.
``It's going to help the health of the entire industry. The sooner
we get this thing fixed, the better it's going to be for
everybody.''
   The symposium also featured Federal Home Loan Bank Board
Chairman M. Danny Wall, who told listeners it was important to
build up the industry's capital.
   ``We see (that) more and more of our attention should be given
to the savings side,'' Wall said. ``This country has got to do more
about capital expansion if we want to continue to be competitive in
this world.''
   Thrifts are attractive investments in several aspects, according
to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. Unlike commercial
banks, they are relatively easy to acquire, and there are few
restrictions on what types of businesses may acquire an ailing
thrift.
   Furthermore, they provide flexibility in investment powers,
including broad powers for real-estate-related diversification, and
are relatively easy to expand geographically, under federal laws
allowing thrifts to branch in up to three states.
   In its latest acquisition, DP Holdings Inc., the investment
group headed by Martin and Simon, received federal approval Tuesday
to acquire two California savings and loan institutions, including
one that is insolvent.
   DP Holdings will raise up to $207.5 million in new capital to
finance the acquisition and will get a federal assistance package
totaling an estimated $565 million.
   McLin, whose limited partnership in May acquired Eureka Federal
Savings & Loan Association, a troubled San Francisco-area thrift,
said that to successfully take over a thrift an investor must have
capital, good management and patience.
   ``We went into (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) with
the willingness to invest $100 million _ and we had this in cash,''
he said, describing the Eureka acquisition.
   ``Conversely, if you're short on capital you'd better be very
long on management. If you can go in and hit them with a proven
track record, then it's possible without creating more of a joint
venture framework,'' McLin said.
   Regulators are trying to sell 259 thrifts. A much larger number
are technically insolvent but have not yet been taken over by
federal officials.
   Last week in Atlanta, a similar symposium attracted 600 people.
   Bank Board officials have struggled to bring new capital into a
thrift industry battered by bad loans, and see the interest in the
symposiums as a sign that enthusiasm among investors may be growing.
