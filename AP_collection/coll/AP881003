   ``Greetings to the people, this is Tania. On April 15 my
comrades and I expropriated $10,660.02 from the Sunset branch of
the Hibernia Bank. Casualties could have been avoided had the
persons involved kept out of the way and cooperated with the
people's forces.'' _ Patty Hearst, April 1974.

   The newspaper heiress sat smiling in a posh
Manhattan hotel suite, answering questions about her past as an
urban guerrilla and her present status as a suburban housewife.
   ``The whole business gets stirred up every five or 10 years
anyway,'' Patricia Hearst Shaw said, as she sipped a glass of
mineral water. ``And then six months from now they'll have
forgotten what I look like again and that will be that.''
   What's stirring up things now is Paul Schrader's ``Patty
Hearst,'' based on her recently re-released book, ``Patty Hearst:
Her Own Story,'' which tells the story of her 1974 San Francisco
kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
   Hearst's two daughters, Lydia, 3, and Gillian, 7, will see
actress Natasha Richardson _ posing as Mommy _ hold a rifle while
robbing a California bank.
   ``It was something I knew would be done,'' she said of the
movie. ``And so, when (producer) Marvin Worth came and said he
wanted to use the book and make a film, I thought, well, this is
kind of my best chance. If it's going to happen, it's going to
happen.''
   Besides, Hearst said, one of her two daughters already knows the
tale of Tania, the name given to her by SLA head Donald DeFreeze,
also known as Field Marshal Cinque. He and five other SLA members
died in a shootout with police three months after the kidnapping.
   ``My eldest does only because she came home from the bus one day
and asked about it. Someone on the bus had told her about it,'' she
said. ``She wasn't that interested in it, you know?
   ``She was kind of shocked that it had really happened. She
couldn't believe it and she's never said anything about it again.''
   Hearst is the daughter of Randolph A. Hearst, chairman of the
board of the Hearst Corp., which owns an assortment of newspapers,
radio stations, magazines and television stations across the
country. Her grandfather, William Randolph Hearst, was the subject
of Orson Welles' acclaimed film, ``Citizen Kane.''
   The kidnapping was more a matter of expediency than anything
else. Her name had been in the newspaper announcing her engagement
to Steven Weed, along with the fact she was attending University of
California at Berkeley. The kidnappers pulled a card with her
address from a public file at school.
   ``They never did ask for ransom,'' Hearst said. ``I'm really
hard-pressed to say what they (the SLA) were thinking about. They
were saying, `Well, we would have kidnapped your father except he
was so much more heavily protected.' And I thought, `Oh, please.'
It's the same as everybody else: They kidnap or injure women and
children because it's easier. I don't know what politically their
goal was supposed to be.''
   As a gesture of good faith on behalf of his daughter, Hearst
established a $2 million program called ``People in Need'' which
distributed food to the needy throughout California. The SLA
leaders never responded to the program; initially, they demanded
that $70 worth of food go to every needy person in the state.
   Patricia Hearst has had her family's support throughout.
   ``I was surprised, because with the SLA they were busy
convincing me that not only had my family abandoned me, they would
never want to see me again,'' she said.
   She maintained in the interview, as she has all along, that she
was brainwashed and totally under the sway of the SLA because of
its mental and physical torture of her.
   The abduction was front-page news. The subsequent events _ two
bank robberies, one slaying, 19 months on the run, rumors the whole
thing was staged, her arrest, trial, conviction and presidential
pardon _ seemed almost like a movie as they occurred.
   ``If you weren't reading about me, you were reading about the
Watergate hearings, or someone else going to prison or being
indicted,'' said Hearst, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek
seven times in two years. ``I guess it just fit right in there with
all the other political drama that was taking place at the time.''
   She was arrested in September 1975, convicted of participating
in the bank robbery and received a seven-year prison sentence.
President Carter pardoned her in 1979. She married Bernard Shaw,
her former bodyguard, and they have been living in Westport, Conn.,
for the past four years.
   Hearst wasn't involved in the making of the movie, although she
did meet once with Richardson and she has viewed the finished
product. Did it bring back bad memories?
   ``Yes and no,'' she said. ``It's really so different for me to
try and look at it as an objective observer. So I haven't really
spent any time thinking how does this make me feel; it's more like,
`What am I seeing up there?'''
   Hearst has changed dramatically from the 21-year-old who raised
a clenched fist for photographers after her arrest by the FBI, who
listed her occupation as ``urban guerrilla,'' who was labeled ``a
common criminal'' by U.S. Attorney General William Saxbe.
   Now 34, she lives quietly with her husband and children,
occasionally returning to San Francisco for such events as the
opening of the opera season.
   The flashbacks that plagued her after the kidnapping _ violent
dreams where she would kill SLA comrades Bill and Emily Harris _
are gone. She giggles nervously about the events of the past,
although she acknowledges that discussing them can be disquieting.
   ``I don't like it much,'' Hearst said.
   And she's hopeful the release of the movie can be the final
chapter in the Hearst case.
   To those who remain skeptical about her story, she says, ``I
think the movie is like reading my book and saying there's still
questions that aren't answered _ well, I guess only if you can't
stand what you read, if you wanted to hear something else.''

<HEAD>`Patty Hearst' Kidnaps The Imagination Of Paul Schrader</HEAD>

   Director Paul Schrader believes a good movie
should make good dinner conversation.
   ``And maybe that's the goal of this movie _ not to solve the
case,'' said Schrader of his latest project, the film ``Patty
Hearst.''
   While tidy endings abound elsewhere, ``Patty Hearst'' stops just
where it starts: atop a stack of questions, with few explanations
about why a kidnapped heiress became a self-proclaimed urban
guerrilla. Final conclusions about guilt or innocence, as Schrader
sees it, should be made back at home, over roast beef, mashed
potatoes and buttered green beans.
   Such ambiguity marks a change of course for the filmmaker. When
writing ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Raging Bull'' and ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' Schrader dealt with visceral emotions. With ``Patty
Hearst,'' he has made a movie whose loudest voice is ambivalence.
   But that, he thinks, is what daily decisions are sometimes
about. ``Movies offer us problems. But life offers us dilemmas,''
he said in an interview. ``It's always easier watching movies
because there is a problem, and they get rid of the problem.''
   Schrader's career, like that of any demanding filmmaker, has
been marked by both triumphs and spills. Even those who didn't see
Robert De Niro in 1976's ``Taxi Driver'' can quote Schrader's
dialogue verbatim: ``You talkin' to me?'' But who remembers 1987's
``Light of Day.''
   He also did an erotic remake of ``Cat People'' in 1981, starring
Nastassja Kinski, Malcolm McDowell and John Heard.
   A Michigan native, he graduated from the University of
California at Los Angeles' film school and lives in New York with
his wife, actress Mary Beth Hurt. Since he began work in 1974 by
writing the screenplay for Sidney Pollack's ``The Yakuza,'' about
Japanese gangsters, Schrader has been drawn repeatedly to colorful
and controversial figures.
   ``I didn't really know the answer to the (Hearst) dilemma
before,'' he said, ``and I still don't. That was one of the things
I had to accept in making the film. The answer to, `Did she or
didn't she?' is yes and no. You try to present that mystery to the
audience. But when I tried to weigh the argument to one side or the
other, I found that it rang false. Yes, she was turned into a
political revolutionary. No, that wasn't Patty Hearst. For every
statement, there is an equally valid counterstatement.''
   When Hearst told her story in the book ``Every Secret Thing,''
she said the Symbionese Liberation Army brainwashed her during her
1974 ordeal. Schrader's movie, while adapted by Nicholas Kazan from
the book, takes a slightly different tack. ``Patty Hearst''
balances the scales, suggesting that Hearst may have made a choice
in her own destiny.
   ``It looked interesting from the outside _ kidnapping, bank
robbery, shootout _ but then you got in it and you say, `Wait.
There's no story,''' Schrader said. ``You can imagine that if she
had died in Watts (during the shootout that killed six SLA members)
what the mythology machine would have made of her. She would have
been Tania, the grand revolutonary hero.
   ``But there are some massive limits here. The story is
dramatically deficient. ... You care about people who do things.
This girl doesn't do anything. She doesn't act. She is acted upon.
It runs against the commercial essence of cinema.''
   To make ``Patty Hearst'' as compelling as possible, Schrader
spun out a visually inventive narrative: It sticks to the facts,
but with odd camera angles, cyclical music and eerie, gothic sets.
He cast British actress Natasha Richardson, daughter of Vanessa
Redgrave, in the title role.
   ``If I did a docudrama, it would just lie there,'' he said.
``This called for a hand of authorship. I am telling her story. And
I have to acknowledge that the first pronoun in that sentence is as
important as the second.''
   Odd though it may sound, there are similarities between Hearst
and some of Schrader's earlier protagonists.
   ``In a way, she's a socially marginable character, too,''
Schrader said. ``And I've always enjoyed taking a point of view of
someone who's sort of on the margins of society _ a psychopathic
cab driver (`Taxi Driver'), a homosexual, suicidal novelist
(`Mishima'), the boxer Jake LaMotta (`Raging Bull'), Jesus (`The
Last Temptation') _ and say, `Let's take their point of view. Let's
see the world as they see it.'
   ``One of the things that the movie sort of says at the end is,
`Here we have this empty vessel, who everyone turns into a symbol
for their own purposes. ... And at the end of the movie, she says,
`Look. I hate to disappoint you. But I'm just me and I'm not that
interesting.'''

   The court-ordered removal of children from the
Bethel Home for Children due to suspicion of brutality and neglect
infuriated founder Herman Fountain, who bitterly regretted his
failure to defy authorities in the name of church rights. Before
the battle of Bethel was over, he would have another chance to do
just that. This is the third and concluding installment of ``Gates
of Hell.''

   Friday's raid at the Bethel Home for
Children was followed by Monday's last stand.
   Over the weekend, word reached Judge Robert Oswald that some of
the children who had fled police had returned to Bethel. He ordered
authorities back to the church to retrieve any children they could
find.
   Bethel founder Herman Fountain, in Youth Court awaiting further
hearing testimony, caught wind of the action and ordered his staff
to ignore the subpoenas that had summoned them and return to
Bethel. There would be no compromise on this day.
   Fountain locked the church doors, barricading three dozen
parents and children in the church they had built by hand. Dozens
of state troopers and sheriff's deputies stood by for more than
three hours, while Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain Jr. tried
to negotiate the childrens' release.
   Police finally broke in and took the children, while church
members recited Bible verse and sang hymns.
   ``If God be for us who can be against us?'' read the Bethel sign
by the road.
   Fountain; his eldest son, Herman Jr., nicknamed Bubba, and
Brother David Owens were among eight people arrested that day.
Fountain faces three counts of felonious assault on a police
officer and one count of inciting a riot, all scheduled to be
presented to the grand jury later this month.
   Troubles seemed to overrun the pastor like the locusts of
Pharaoh's Egypt. A former Bethel resident, Rhonnda Traxler,
gathered reporters outside the courthouse and alleged Fountain
sexually molested her and another girl while they were at Bethel.
Fountain denied the accusation and leveled his own: ``You can't
believe this girl. There's no telling how many men she's been
with.''
   Another former Bethel child, Ray Friery, filed a $1 million
federal lawsuit against Fountain, alleging assault and battery,
abuse, neglect and false imprisonment.
   Fountain wasn't the only one with problems. Many state workers
involved in the case received harassing phone calls or believed
they were being followed by Bethel supporters.
   Brittain sent his 13-year-old daughter out of state after
anonymous callers threatened to kidnap her and put her in a church
home where she would never be found again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Before the Youth Court hearings ended, about half of the more
than 70 children taken from Bethel had testified. Some were too
frightened to appear.
   ``They're really wicked little kids,'' Fountain said in a later
interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm talking about
homosexuals, I'm talking about lesbians, I'm talking about
prostitutes. I'm talking about one boy who raped his 84-year-old
grandmother. I'm talking about one who murdered his sister.
   ``I'm talking habitual runaways, I'm talking car thieves, I'm
talking nymphomaniacs.''
   Brittain dealt with the same youngsters but saw something
different.
   ``For the most part, they're pretty normal kids who have been
battered around by life pretty badly,'' the welfare commissioner
said. ``They're children trying to put their lives back together.''
   Some parents had despaired of getting help from state agencies;
for them, Bethel was a last resort. For others, it was a matter of
convenience. One child was sent to Bethel because he ``took food
from the refrigerator,'' Brittain said.
   But as the hearing continued after the raid on Bethel, some
parents sat in the courtroom and wept, overwhelmed by stories of
hair-pulling, face-slapping, lap-running and switchings. A
13-year-old girl with Down's syndrome said she ran laps all day
long, received frequent spankings and sometimes stood for hours on
tiptoe with her chin above a light switch.
   ``They said she was a little brat and had a demon in her,''
another girl said. ``Parents agreed with it. They said that's what
you deserve if you've acted in a wrong way.''
   Some parents said they were misled. They didn't know what Bethel
really was. Other parents knew exactly what Bethel was.
   ``When I went down there, I was totally convinced what had
occurred was not morally right, legally right or anyway right,''
said Jack Hicks of Birdsboro, Pa. But his two teen-age sons support
Fountain, and they changed his mind.

   ``They love the man tremendously. If my children said to me,
`Dad, that's not the way it was, they were cruel and abused us,'
I'd be after Brother Fountain,'' he said. ``But they've solidified
my support.''
   About 50 of the children were released to their parents, who
signed a court agreement not to return them to Bethel without the
judge's approval. Protecting the children this way was about all
the state and Judge Oswald could do since Bethel is a private,
unregulated facility.
   Now a dozen parents, including Hicks, are preparing a lawsuit
against the state for its action at Bethel.
   ``I look at this much beyond just an incident that occurred in
the state of Mississippi,'' Hicks said. ``Let's term it religious
harassment.''
   __=
   Life is slow at Bethel these days, with so few children around.
The home remains open, but rows of girls' bunk beds stand empty
except for the stuffed bears and rabbits left behind by former
occupants.
   A few new children have come since the hearings. A few former
residents have returned.
   No winner has emerged from the emotional battle over Bethel,
which begins and ends with a collision of convictions.
   Brittain and his team of investigators, Oswald and prosecutor
Mark Maples consider it a matter of child protection.
   Herman Fountain, his faithful flock and other fundamentalists
who came to lend support have called it an issue of religious
freedom.
   Conservative religious belief courses through Mississippi's
veins and beats fiercely in its heart. The perception that the
state is venturing into the realm of the church makes blood run
hot. But so does the perception that church home operators are
using fundamental religion and the Bible as justification to abuse
and neglect children.
   ``I'm a Christian; they're supposed to be Christians,'' said
welfare investigator Kathy Prine, who teaches Sunday school at her
Baptist church. ``I believe this is wrong. These kids are being
physically abused. These people claim the kids are liars and are
not being abused but are being raised by what the Bible says.
   ``It makes you question your faith and your job. When we went in
there, I asked someone, `Am I hurting the church? Am I hurting
God's work by doing this?' I thought about it, and I said, `No. No,
I'm not.'''
   Oswald, in his order removing the children from Bethel, wrote,
``If there is a conflict of interests between religion and the
protection of children, this Court's decision must be to protect
first the children.''
   Fountain sees it another way. ``I dealt with (Oswald) in
chambers, about his soul. He says, `The laws of the land are first
and that (the) Bible's second,''' Fountain said. ``I said, `That's
wrong, that Bible's first and the law of the land is second.'''
   Mississippi, along with North Carolina, South Carolina,
Louisiana, Missouri and Florida, has no law licensing church-run
boarding homes, although some voluntarily apply for licenses.
   As a result, there is no way to reach many of the children in
such homes, many of whom are denied communication with the outside
for months at a time, or to ensure that basic educational,
sanitation and safety standards are met.
   ``We've had to wait years to collect information in bits and
pieces from runaway children,'' Brittain said. ``We have no way of
knowing what's going on inside those four walls.''
   Maples has filed a court petition to force Bethel to comply with
state laws governing education, safety standards and child labor
laws. The court has yet to act on it. If enforced, such an order
could close Bethel, because Fountain has said he would never
cooperate.
   For the two years he has been welfare commissioner, Brittain has
pushed for a law to open the doors of homes like Bethel; Fountain
has prayed against one.
   This might well be the year that the power of prayer is overcome
by the power of politics: observers agree that outrage over
conditions at Bethel has been so great that the Legislature might
be forced to act.
   Even Fountain agrees, saying, ``It would take an act of God'' to
prevent a licensure law from emerging in the next legislative
session.
   At Bethel, they will be praying round the clock.
   ``They're going against God, and that's their problem. That's
why we're going to win,'' Fountain said. ``The gates of hell ain't
going to prevail against our church.''

   KOPKAMTIB was abolished recently by a
KEPPRES, which created BAKORSTANAS to take its place.
   The acronym _ some would call it alphabet soup _ is alive and
kicking in Indonesia. What happened recently, in translation from
Indonesian acronymania, is this:
   The Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and
Order (KOPKAMTIB, or Komando Operasi Pemulihan Keamanan Dan
Ketertiban) was abolished by a presidential decree (KEPPRES, or
keputusan president), which created in its place the Coordinating
Agency for Assisting the Strengthening of National Stability
(BAKORSTANAS, or Badan Koordinasi Bantuan Pemantapan Stabilitas
Nasional).
   Acronyms and abbreviations are a national craze, used to
condense unwieldy phrases but serving in many other cases to
compound confusion.
   For one thing, it is common, if not preferable, to use the first
syllable instead of the first letter of words, as with KEPPRES.
   The main political party is called GOLKAR, which is short for
Golongan Karya and comes out in English as Functional Groups.
   Headline writers delight in the convenience offered by the
thousands of short forms, but to the uninitiated the front pages of
Indonesian newspapers resemble a lexicographer's nightmare.
   Acronyms also are found in telephone books and on the doors of
government offices. Standard dictionaries offer no help.
   Many say the use of acronyms first spread during the
administration (1949-66) of President Sukarno, known familiarly as
Bung Karno, for Brother Sukarno.
   During the Sukarno years, the habit was applied to English
phrases as well as the national tongue, Bahasa Indonesia.
   The term ``neo-colonial imperialism'' was cut to ``necolim.''
   A sports tournament for Third World athletes became known as
Ganefo _ Games of the Newly Emerging Forces.
   Communist China became CINKOM.
   Blame or credit for entrenching linguistic short cuts is usually
pinned on the armed forces, or the abri.
   As early as 1976, Professor Takdir Alisjahbana warned that the
influential military was coining so many acronyms that the standard
of Bahasa Indonesia might deteriorate. He said such usage added
nothing to the stock of new ideas but only increased the burden on
the memory.
   One magazine editor cautioned his staff about shortening jaksa
agung (attorney general) to jagung, which means popcorn.
   There are acronyms for most government departments and senior
officials.
   The president's personal assistants are aspri _ short for
``asisten pribadi president.''
   The alphabet soup is sometimes flavored with numbers.
   P3 is what people sometimes call the opposition political group
Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (United Development Party).
   Then there's BP-7 _ Badan Pembinaan Pendidikan Pelaksanaan
Pedoman Penghayatan Dan Pengamalan Pancasila.
   That's the Board for Guidance on the Means of Teaching
Guidelines for the True Interpretation and Implementation of the
State Ideology.

   Nine months after the Dona Paz sank
in the worst peacetime shipping disaster, the death toll remains a
mystery and secrecy surrounds official investigations into the
cause of the accident.
   The 2,215-ton Dona Paz collided Dec. 20 with the 629-ton oil
tanker Vector off Mindoro island. Both vessels exploded in huge
fireballs.
   Only 26 of the 1,775 people known to be on board the vessels
were saved, but the real death toll may never be known.
   Manifests on inter-island vessels are notoriously inaccurate.
They often record children as ``half passengers'' or disregard them
entirely. Corrupt officials frequently accept bribes to allow
overloading.
   In addition, many victims probably were incinerated when the
vessels exploded and will never be accounted for. Rescuers found
only 108 bodies, many of them charred and mutilated beyond
recognition.
   Sulpicio Lines, owner of the Dona Paz, has never officially
acknowledged that the passenger ship carried more than the 1,583
people listed on the manifest.
   But Vicente Gambito, a Sulpicio Lines vice president, says the
company has paid claims to relatives of 2,748 people. He said each
claimant received $1,500 in exchange for agreeing not to file suits
or seek additional compensation.
   Another 1,642 claims are being processed.
   Uncertainty of just who was on the ship has led to fraud.
Gambito said one man was jailed after receiving a settlement, then
returning with claims for another 13 ``relatives.'' Some
``relatives'' turned up in the United States and were not even
related to the claimant, Gambito said.
   ``What we're trying to play here is a percentage game,'' he
said. ``There is no way that we can, with finality, prove or
disprove that a person was on board. So we are taking chances.''
   The Dona Paz was authorized to carry 1,518 passengers and a crew
of 60. The Vector carried 13 crewmen, two of whom survived.
   Most aboard the Dona Paz were poor people from the islands of
Samar and Leyte who planned to spend Christmas with relatives in
Manila.
   Gambito said payment of claims does not necessarily mean the
company admits the claimants' relatives were aboard the Dona Paz.
He said five applications proved false.
   But Rosario Marasigan, an assistant director of the Department
of Social Welfare and member of the government task force, said she
believes most of the claims settled by the company were genuine.
   Both houses of Congress have completed separate investigations
but have not acted on their findings.
   Both congressional reports found virtually everything about
Philippine shipping wrong. They cited obsolete ships and navigation
charts, poor or non-existent communication and navigational aids,
lax enforcement of safety regulations, and poorly trained crews.
   Officials say there would have probably been no survivors if
three merchant ships had not been in the area when the collision
occurred. They picked up the survivors.
   The Philippine Coast Guard has not released findings of the
official investigation conducted by its Board of Marine Inquiry.
Board members, mostly retired civilian seamen, said they submitted
their findings to the Coast Guard in March.
   The Coast Guard in Manila, 110 miles north of the collision,
received first word of the tragedy eight hours after it happened.
It took another eight hours to launch search and rescue operations.
   One of the many unanswered questions is whether the Dona Paz
sent out a distress call. None of the crew survived, and no radio
station reported any distress signal.
   To check the effectiveness of the receiving system, National
Telecommunications Commission Chief Jose Luis Alcuaz boarded a ship
a few weeks after the disaster and sent an SOS from the collision
site. No Coast Guard station acknowledged receipt.
   Members of the marine board refuse to discuss their findings.
Law requires that findings be forwarded to the Coast Guard
commandant for review and release.
   Lt. Cmdr. Makaraig Cuevas, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the
papers were being reviewed.
   Asked why a report had not been released, Col. Victor Corpuz,
the Coast Guard official reviewing the findings, replied: ``The
commandant has not signed it. Why are you interested?'' He then
hung up.

alive.

   Raoul Wallenberg is a ghost in the
Soviet prison system. Officially declared dead by Moscow, he is a
faint shadow who over the last 43 years has wandered through
prisons, mental hospitals and labor camps.
   Whether dead or alive, the Swedish diplomat lives at least for
those who admire his courage in saving thousands of people from
Nazi death camps during World War II. He would be 76.
   Rumors reaching his family say Wallenberg, arrested by the
Soviets in Budapest, Hungary, in the waning days of the war, was
still living in an isolation cell earlier this year.
   ``We have indications. That's all we can say without endangering
people. They are not witnesses, only indications,'' said his
half-sister, Nina Lagergren.
   The Soviets never explained why they arrested Wallenberg, but it
is likely they suspected him of being an American spy. The Kremlin
later expressed regret.
   ``We cannot have a question in our minds that he is alive,''
said Mrs. Lagergren, 67, in an interview. ``How could we work for
40 years for his freedom if there was a doubt in our minds? We have
to believe.''
   Mrs. Lagergren, who runs the Raoul Wallenberg Committee of
Sweden, clings to any reason for hope.
   In Soviet prisons, she said, ``people can survive a long time.
It may be cynical to call it good, but there is no stress from
daily life, you don't overeat, you don't drink or smoke. Humans
have a fantastic ability to adapt.''
   Swedish author Kenne Fant, whose novel ``R,'' based on
Wallenberg's imprisonment, was published in August, said he
believes the prisoner's records have been destroyed and that his
identity may be lost forever.
   Pressure to find Wallenberg persists.
   ``We raise the question at every opportunity,'' said Vollrath
Tham, the Foreign Ministry official in charge of the Wallenberg
file. The U.S. and Israeli governments also are active.
   On Sept. 16, Warren Zimmermann, U.S. delegation chief at the
Vienna Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, demanded
``a full and open accounting'' of Wallenberg's fate.
   Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, replying four days later at
a news briefing in Moscow, said that according to a handwritten
report found in 1957 in the Lubyanka Prison archives, Wallenberg
died in 1947 of a heart attack, two years after his arrest. It said
he was cremated.
   ``There is nothing new in it,'' said Mrs. Lagergren. ``They have
repeated it for 30 years, and if you study it, it's quite
unbelievable. Even they concede there is no evidence that Raoul is
dead.''
   Mrs. Lagergren said she hoped for a new probe of the case,
because she believed the Soviets were interested in clearing the
record on the crimes of the Stalin era.
   When he was 32, Wallenberg went to Budapest at the suggestion of
the U.S. War Refugee Board. Besides providing passports and ``safe
houses'' for Jews, he dissuaded the Nazis from blowing up the
Jewish ghetto before evacuating the city, saving its 70,000
residents from probable death.
   Wallenberg had been in Hungary six months when he was arrested.
Many Hungarian Jews credited Wallenberg for their survival.
   Fant said that while researching his novel, he spoke with
someone, whom he did not identify, who heard Wallenberg was seen
Dec. 22, 1986, in the south-central labor camp of Blagoveshchenka,
a closed city in the Soviet Union.
   Fant told reporters in August his source ``has been in touch
with a person who saw a bent old man at the labor camp who was
being treated for frostbite on his right foot. This man was
described by fellow inmates as the one who saved Jews in Budapest.''
   In 1974, Wallenberg was reported seen in the Siberian camp of
Vadivovo. He was described as an old-looking man with thin white
hair who had been ill.
   Sweden questioned the Soviets about Wallenberg in 1956 and again
in 1965, but let the case lie dormant until a new eyewitness
account surfaced in 1978.
   Under pressure from Israel, President Jimmy Carter raised the
issue at the 1979 summit with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   ``That was during the detente period. We hoped that Raoul would
be back within a year,'' said Mrs. Lagergren.
   Gorbachev's glasnost policy has revived hope, said Mrs.
Lagergren. Her other brother, Guy von Dardel, ``was in the Soviet
Union in June, and he felt the atmosphere had changed. They were
much more open and cooperative,'' she said.

<HEAD>Candidates Say Quality of Judges, Not Ideology, Would Determine
Choices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush hints that rival
Michael Dukakis might get advice from the American Civil Liberties
Union on filling Supreme Court vacancies while Democratic critics
suggest that Bush will be bound by a GOP platform plank insisting
upon judges who oppose abortion.
   But beyond the campaign rhetoric, both candidates respond in a
similar fashion on the question of naming justices: Both insist
they won't apply an ideological litmus test to their choices.
   ``I think if you ask people in my state, they'll tell you that
my record is a strong one,'' Dukakis said last week. ``I look for
people of intelligence and integrity. I don't ask them what their
party affiliation is.''
   Bush has said he will appoint judges ``who have more sympathy
for the victims of crime and less for the criminals.''
   But asked specifically last week if he would heed that GOP
platform plank calling for the appointment of judges who ``respect
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human
life,'' Bush said:
   ``I don't want to have a specific objective for a judge. ... I
want people who will interpret the Constitution and not legislate
from the bench. I would not have a litmus test criteria. ... I'd
keep it very general,'' he said.
   As the Supreme Court opens its 1988-89 term today, the question
of the kind of individuals each candidate would appoint to the high
court is percolating as a campaign issue.
   In appearances last week, the vice president repeatedly
challenged Dukakis to say whether he would follow the advice of the
ACLU in selecting Supreme Court justices.
   ``I think it's a good question to ask. All he has to say is no,
they won't have any influence on him,'' Bush said in Michigan on
Thursday.
   The vice president has sought to portray Dukakis as an
ultra-liberal because of the Democrat's own characterization of
himself last year as a ``card-carrying member of the ACLU.'' The
organization often has defended the free-speech rights of groups
advocating unpopular causes and Bush contends it has a liberal
agenda.
   The next president seems likely to put a major stamp on the
makeup of the nine-member court. Bush has said that the 41st
president ``will very possibly appoint two or three justices to the
Supreme Court, where they'll sit well into the next century.''
   When the next president takes office, the three oldest and most
liberal justices will be over 80: William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   Dukakis was asked in an April interview with The Village Voice
whom he particularly respected among the Supreme Court justices.
His choices: Louis D. Brandeis (served l916-39), Hugo L. Black
(1937-1971), William O. Douglas (1939-1975), Brennan (1956-) and
Marshall (1967-). All were considered liberals.
   Voice columnist Nat Hentoff cited a 1986 tribute by Bush to the
late Potter Stewart (served 1958-81), who is considered a
middle-of-the roader.
   ``Potter thought it important not to succumb to ideological
labels'' Bush said, and then quoted Stewart: ``Your boss is only
the Constitution and the law. But they can be _ and should be _
very, very strict bosses.''
   As governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis has appointed more than
100 judges, ranging from municipal court justices to the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts.
   The September issue of The American Lawyer quotes Sheldon
Goldman, a University of Massachusetts law professor, as saying the
judges Dukakis has appointed, generally, have been ``cautiously
liberal, or moderately progressive.''
   The Supreme Court in recent years has become increasingly
conservative.
   Still, even though President Reagan made three appointments to
the court _ Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy
_ he will not leave quite the stamp on the court that some liberals
had feared.
   Each of his appointments replaced justices who were either
moderate or conservative, and Reagan did not have a chance to
replace a liberal with a conservative member.
   Says Dukakis: ``These are lifetime appointments. These are
appointments that have to be made very carefully. ... There is
nothing a president does that leaves a more lasting legacy than the
appointment of justices to the Supreme Court.''

<HEAD>Legacy Of Leftist Military Ruler Shadows Peru</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The shadow of a leftist military ruler and his
revolutionary government still hovers over Peru, 20 years after he
seized power with tanks and troops and left an indelible stamp on
Peruvian life.
   Gen. Juan Velasco, a stocky career soldier and fiery speaker,
toppled Peru's democratic government on Oct. 3, 1968, and forced
then-president Fernando Belaunde into a lengthy exile.
   Under an ambitious program labeled ``neither capitalist nor
communist,'' Velasco's regime radicalized Peruvian politics,
imposed widespread state economic controls and began lasting social
reform.
   In a military legacy, Velasco steered Peru away from the United
States and toward the Soviet Union. Peru remains Latin America's
leading purchaser of Soviet arms outside of Central America,
according to the U.S. government.
   Leftist political parties, which had operated on the fringe of
national politics, emerged during the Velasco era to become a
dominant force.
   His efforts to revolutionize Peru's deeply entrenched class
structure, while cutting dependence on the United States, won
widespread acclaim throughout the Third World.
   ``Velasco was a person who wanted to make reform in behalf of
the poor. He had a genuine commitment to that,'' said Felipe Ortiz
de Zevallos, head of the respected economics analysis firm Apoyo.
   But Ortiz de Zevallos and other Peruvian analysts say Velasco's
well intentioned efforts to set Peru on a more socially just course
failed due to nearsightedness and contradictory and authoritarian
policies.
   The military strongman himself was deposed in another bloodless
military coup amid increasing economic woes in 1975. He died two
years later after a lengthy illness.
   The succeeding military government of Gen. Francisco Morales
Bermudez toned down the strident nationalist rhetoric that
frightened the middle and upper classes and alienated foreign
businessmen and investors.
   It also began dismantling some of Velasco's reforms while
preparing the way for restoration of democracy. Belaunde was
re-elected president in 1980.
   Analysts say the current policies of President Alan Garcia,
elected to a five-year-term in 1985, reflect the authoritarian
approach at reforming Peru's conservative structure.
   Garcia's nationalization of Peru's private banks a year ago, in
the mold of Velasco, met great opposition and aggravated Peru's
mounting economic woes, analysts said.
   Analysts said a major reason for the 1968 coup was the belief
that stability provided by a military government was needed to
foment modernization and avoid growth of insurgency movements.
   ``The military was absolutely convinced that the country had to
be changed in a scheme of social justice,'' said Federico Velarde,
director of the social studies institute Desco.
   Despite Velasco's efforts, one of the world's most mysterious
and bloody leftist guerrilla groups, the Shining Path, took up arms
in 1980 in a growing insurgency that has claimed 12,000 lives.
   Velasco's first moves were a series of widespread
nationalizations, which started with the takeover of the Exxon
subsidiary International Petroleum Company.
   As the state's economic role grew, the government imposed
production and distribution reform and allowed worker participation
in businesses.
   Peru's communist-dominated unions have since become one of the
nation's most powerful political and economic forces in Peru.
   Velasco then wrenched from Peru's aristocracy the rich sugar and
cotton plantations of the coast and the massive cattle and farming
haciendas in the highlands, aiming an agrarian reform at returning
land to the Indian peasants who worked it for centuries as virtual
serfs.
   Ortiz de Zevallos said many of the Velasco's programs resulted
in a morass of inefficiency because they were poorly planned and
executed.
   The quantity and quality of industrial and agricultural output
declined between 1968 and 1975, he said.
   Ortiz de Zevallos said Peru under Velasco began a process of
indebtedness to foreign lenders, which led to a false sense of
well-being that still exists.
   ``The situation produced exactly the opposite of what the
military government had proposed,'' said Julio Colter, director of
the Institute of Peruvian Studies, a sociological research
organization.
   ``A new round of social inequalities followed that manifested
themselves in intensified class struggle and a generalized
opposition to the government,'' he said.

   A keen-eyed captain of a West German
cargo ship rescued two British fishermen who were close to death
after six hours in the English Channel, Falmouth coast guard said
today.
   ``They were just two heads bobbing in the water,'' said coast
guard duty officer David Mayall. ``They were very lucky to be
seen.''
   With water temperature at 59 degrees, ``we would expect people
to die after that length of time in the water,'' Mayall said.
   ``It was pure luck we spotted them,'' said Capt. Gunter Feicks
of the Hamburg-registered Jan Becker, 3,170 tons, which was en
route from Rotterdam to Waterford in the Irish Republic.
   Fishermen Fred Steel and Gregory Lett, both age 38 from
Cornwall, grabbed life belts and jumped into the sea at 2 a.m.
Sunday when their 60-foot boat, Semper Parates, sank from an
unknown cause in 10 minutes off Land's End.
   Six hours later, the freighter passed by and Feicks, looking
through his binoculars, spotted something in the water ``that
shouldn't have been there.''
   The ship called for help and a Royal Navy helicopter winched the
two men from the sea and flew them to a hospital in Truro. They
were suffering from hypothermia _ subnormal body temperature _ but
were comfortable, the hospital said.

   Two days after his heart surgery,
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece was able to get out of
bed and walk, a Harefield Hospital spokesman said.
   The 69-year-old leader underwent six hours of surgery on Friday
to replace a diseased aortic valve.
   ``He is fine. There are no problems or complications,'' said a
hospital spokesman on Sunday. He said Papandreou was able to walk
around the intensive care unit of the hospital.
   Papandreou was restricted over the weekend to visits from his
three sons, his daughter and his companion, Dimitra Liani. His
wife, whom he said he is divorcing, did not come to Britain.
   If Papandreou continues to make good progress, he could be out
of the hospital in 10 days.
   The Greek leader flew to Britain last month suffering from
narrowing of the main heart artery and underwent treatment to ready
him for the operation.

<HEAD>Close Contest in Key States Likely to Decide White House Winner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush commands an early autumn advantage
over Michael Dukakis in the Electoral College, but the campaign for
the White House will be decided in a series of close, hard fought
contests from California to Connecticut, according to an Associated
Press survey of the 50 states.
   Republicans sound confident following a strong, late summer
surge by Bush. Democrats project concern but say there's ample time
to overtake the vice president.
   ``Dukakis won the primary on his Massachusetts miracle claim,
but now people are remembering what government, the economy, was
under Jimmy Carter,'' said Tony Feather, executive director of the
Republican Party in Missouri, where the two candidates are rated
even.
   Said Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, where Dukakis is
the underdog: ``It's not over yet by any stretch of the
imagination. But he's got to go on the offensive'' against Bush's
charges of liberalism.
   The nationwide public opinion surveys indicate a narrow
advantage for Bush, although the same surveys show enough undecided
and loosely committed voters to alter the outcome of the race at
the last moment.
   Adding to the uncertainty is a campaign calendar that includes a
debate Wednesday between vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle
and Lloyd Bentsen, followed by a return engagement between Dukakis
and Bush in mid-October. After that comes a three-week sprint to
the finish line punctuated by a barrage of television commercials.
   Despite steady, late summer advances by Bush _ and Democratic
talk of a Dukakis rebound _ neither man has been able to seize an
advantage in a string of states where the election will be decided.
The list includes Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey,
Connecticut, California and more, totalling over 150 electoral
votes.
   It takes 270 electoral votes to win the White House, and the
only Democrat to make it in the last five elections was a
southerner, Jimmy Carter.
   Bush appears to be solidifying much of the traditional
Republican base across the South and Rocky Mountain West, the
survey showed. He is rated the solid leader in Florida with its 21
electoral votes and seems to be opening a little daylight between
himself and the Democrats in Texas, although Dukakis is waging an
intensive campaign in running mate Lloyd Bentsen's home state.
   Border states such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee
remain competitive.
   Dukakis is given the edge in several traditional Democratic
party strongholds, including New York with its 36 electoral votes,
but has not been as successful as Bush in cementing his own
political base.
   The AP survey of political leaders, independent analysts and
public opinion polls in all 50 states turned up frequent
expressions of concern among Democrats over the shape of Dukakis'
campaign, tempered with hope that the Massachusetts governor may be
on the rebound after suffering a political free fall earlier in the
campaign.
   ``I think we have turned around what I perceived was a slide
here,'' said Ohio's Democratic chairman, Jim Ruvolo.
   In Maryland, a traditional Democratic state where the polls show
a close race, the party's vice chairman, John Willis, said, ``I
would like to be further ahead. I would like to be 20 points ahead
but that's unrealistic.''
   Republicans who were worried when Bush was down in the polls
last summer are smiling at their fortunes now that he is showing
surprising strength in states like New York, Pennsylvania and Iowa
that figured to be among his weakest.
   ``It looks like a dead heat in states like New York and
Massachusetts and a really strong Democratic candidate should be
considerably ahead in states like those at this point,'' said
Robert S. Poliner, chairman of the Republican party in Connecticut.
Dukakis remains a solid favorite in both Massachusetts and New
York, the AP survey showed.
   Senior campaign aides to both men offer different perspectives.
   Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said Bush's electoral
college base of ``210 to 220 votes'' is intact, freeing the vice
president to campaign intensively in swing states with occasional
forays into Democratic strongholds.
   Dukakis aides say the race will be won or lost in the large
number of battleground states where neither candidate has the edge.
   ``The race has tightened up and it's competitive and a lot of
people haven't made up their minds,'' said Dukakis communications
director, Leslie Dach. ``The states that we need to win this race
are very competitive.
   The Electoral College lineup looks like this:
   _ Bush's strongest region is probably the South, where he leads
almost everywhere. Bentsen's presence on the ticket almost
guarantees a close race in Texas, however, and Dukakis has strong
support in North Carolina and border states such as Arkansas,
Kentucky and Tennessee.
   _ California and Washington on the West Coast are rated as
tossups, with Dukakis given the edge in Oregon. Bush appears to
have firmed up support in traditional Republican states such as
Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, but the Dukakis campaign says it has
strength in New Mexico and Montana.
   _ Farm states such as Kansas and Nebraska are leaning to Bush,
while Dukakis harbors hope for the Dakotas. Dukakis is favored in
Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota in the upper Midwest. Dukakis has no
hopes for Quayle's home state of Indiana. The Democrat seems to
have a slight edge in Illinois, but Democrats concede he is
probably slightly behind in Ohio and Missouri. Republicans see a
narrow advantage in Michigan.
   _ The Northeast is Dukakis' strongest region, and despite
closer-than-expected public polls, he is regarded as the likely
winner at home in Massachusetts as well as New York, Rhode Island,
Maryland and West Virginia. Vermont and Maine appear to be close,
and New Hampshire is Bush territory.

<HEAD>Tiny Town Of Bickleton Builds A Home For Bluebirds</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BICKLETON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birdhouses outnumber homes in this tiny
community, which bills itself the bluebird capital of the world and
goes out of its way to make sure the shy birds keep coming back.
   This town of 150 in the windswept Horse Heaven Hills first gave
bluebirds an incentive to stay more than two decades ago, and they
have returned again and again to raise their young and provide a
little extra income for a depressed economy.
   ``It's a real community pride,'' said Lynn Mains, co-owner of a
restaurant and one of many who help maintain the birdhouses.
   The Bickleton bluebirds are now gathering in flocks for their
mid-October migration to Mexico or southern California. The males
begin returning in February, often to the same house, and are
followed by the females.
   Although the altitude and climate of this wheat country are
ideal for bluebirds, their population was declining two decades
ago, Ms. Mains said. The birds are cavity dwellers, and there were
not enough dead trees or rotted fence posts for them to build nests
in.
   Jess Brinkerhoff of nearby Richland realized the problem while
camping in the area with his wife, Elva, in 1965. They nailed up a
rusty one-gallon can, and that became the first of about 1,500
birdhouses that fill the town and dot the surrounding countryside.
   At first, the Brinkerhoffs were the lone caretakers for the
birds, building, cleaning and maintaining the houses. ``My wife
passed away four years ago, and then the people of Bickleton took
over,'' said Brinkerhoff, 78.
   Because arthritis and advancing age have slowed Brinkerhoff
down, the chief birdhouse maker now is Bill Shotwell, who's built
about 400.
   ``I usually saw out the pieces for 100 birdhouses and drill the
holes, and I'm supposed to be retired,'' Shotwell said.
   Unlike the many swallows that swarm to San Juan Capistrano in
southern California on the same day every year, just a few thousand
bluebirds trickle into Bickleton.
   But that was enough to lead the North American Bluebird Society
to proclaim Bickleton the bluebird capital of the world in 1983.
The Brinkerhoffs also were recognized.
   It's not easy to keep bluebirds in the neighborhood. Old nests
must be completely cleaned out each winter, and the houses need
periodic maintenance.
   The houses are white and the roofs blue, approximating the color
of the male bird's plumage. ``The females are attracted to it,''
Ms. Mains explained.
   The little town hasn't profited much from its bluebirds, mostly
because it is so far off the beaten path. Bickleton is 50 miles
south of Yakima, on a narrow, winding two-lane road that climbs
steeply up to the town.
   But a few hundred visitors are drawn each year by celebrations
such as the annual Bluebird Run and the Bluebird country Christmas.
   Merchants sell glass bluebirds, T-shirts and caps, as well as
the plywood houses made by Shotwell, with profits going toward the
building of more houses.
   In addition, ``each year we have a contest to see who can spot
the first one,'' Ms. Mains said. ``You win a good pat on the back
and a cup of coffee.''

   A policewoman full of life and laughter and a
jobless Vietnam veteran haunted by the horrors of war lived worlds
apart, but their worlds collided when they died side by side in a
bloody rampage.
   Clem Henderson shot Irma Ruiz in the heart in the doorway of the
Montefiore School on the West Side. Minutes later, Henderson fell
fatally wounded just a few feet away, shot by Mrs. Ruiz's partner.
Two other people also died.
   Mrs. Ruiz's partner, Detective Gregory Jaglowski, remembered her
as ``a great woman, best friend. She was the greatest partner you
could ever have.''
   ``Irma made us laugh,'' Officer Dorothy Griffin said in her
eulogy at Mrs. Ruiz' funeral one week ago. ``She loved jewelry and
diamonds, and like a diamond, she sparkled. ... Her sense of humor,
her quick wit, were matched only by her love of family.''
   Both Henderson and Mrs. Ruiz were 40 when they died Sept. 22. He
was the father of three sons; she had three sons and a daughter.
   Henderson harbored a ``passion for the plight'' of Vietnam GIs,
said David Finke, a friend who works for the Midwest Committee for
Military Counseling, a private, non-profit group Henderson was
involved with. ``He felt that nobody wanted to listen, that society
had turned its back.''
   So, he helped other vets, working with the National Black Draft
Counselors and dreaming of creating his own veterans center. He'd
even picked out a building that he talked of buying, Finke said.
   But the day he died, Henderson stalked his neighborhood armed
with a .38-caliber revolver, and vowed to ``kill everybody I see.''
   Henderson's demons likely took him back to Vietnam, friends say.
Psychiatrists call it ``post-traumatic stress syndrome.''
   ``My sense is that once he started shooting, he was just back on
patrol again. He was in the jungle under this detached sense where
you simply turn off your emotions,'' said Finke.
   ``How do we expect them to unlearn those reflexes just because
they are discharged,'' Finke asked. ``You've got a time bomb
situation with embittered people who are feeling abandoned.''
   To know the real Clem Henderson, you have to know his pre-war
life, said Alonzo Jackson, brother of Henderson's ex-wife, Emma.
   ``Before the war, he was open, always happy, and energetic.
After the war, he was different. ... He mostly kept to himself,''
Jackson said at Henderson's burial Friday.
   ``He was a victim of the Vietnam War, plain and simple.''
   Police records show Henderson was arrested 12 times, mostly for
battery and disorderly conduct, and spent more than six years in
jail between 1973 and 1984.
   He found work at a beauty school, but a 1985 gunshot wound to
the head caused seizures that forced him to stop, friends and
acquaintances say. Police records show the wound was
self-inflicted; Henderson's brother, Roger, says he was shot by an
attacker.
   Henderson alternated between living with his mother and his
second wife, Daisy, Finke said. But he also talked of sleeping on
park benches, Finke said.
   Mrs. Ruiz knew the risks of police work, but rarely talked about
the dangers, said brother-in-law Paul Fedrick.
   By all accounts, family and police work were her dreams come
true.
   ``She has approximately 25 nieces and nephews, and she made sure
that every Christmas, every kid had something under the tree,''
said Fedrick, 29. ``She was like the matriarch to the family.''
   She graduated at the top of her class from the police academy in
1976, becoming one of the first Hispanic women on the force, and
won departmental honors since then.
   But her children and family came first.
   ``What stands out in my mind is that whenever we needed a parent
to come in for any reason, she would be there,'' said Sister
Campion Maquire, principal of Christ The King School, which the two
youngest Ruiz children attend.
   ``We were proud to have her in our community,'' said neighbor
and close friend Rose Coleman. ``(I) only wish that everybody had a
chance to know her.''

<HEAD>Transcript of Astronauts' News Conference From Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of the news
conference conducted in orbit Sunday by the five Discovery
astronauts, Frederick H. Hauck, Richard O. Covey, George D. (Pinky)
Nelson, John M. (Mike) Lounge and David C. Hilmers. Questions were
read by reporters at the Johnson Space Center:
   Q. Commander Hauck, you said before the flight that you expected
to see some surprises. Can you tell us what surprises you've seen
on this flight?
   Hauck: Well, I guess the first surprise was right at liftoff. We
had a caution and warning sound, actually an alert tone that got
our attention real quick and gave us a few moments to concern
ourselves about it. We also had a problem with one of our flash
evaporators. Those were technical problems. I guess I was very
pleased that I wasn't surprised, and how much I enjoyed it up here.
We've really enjoyed being up here in this tremendous machine and
seeing the beautiful sights we've seen.
   Q. Gentlemen, you are all veterans of spaceflight, you've all
been there before, but it's been more than 2{ years for all of you.
Is there any difference in being back in space? What have you
observed? Does it feel different or does it feel the same?
   Hilmers: I think it's surprising how little has changed. I think
all of us readapted to space very quickly, and the communications
with Mission Control seemed like it really hadn't been 2{ years. I
think everyone was adept at all the jobs that we had to do, and I
think we got back in business very well.
   Q. Gentlemen, your wives said the other day that watching the
launch they were filled with excitement, but also fear. That it was
wonderful and awful at the same time. I'm interested in your
feelings as you took off.
   Covey: I think I can speak for the crew and say it was really
wonderful when we lifted off. It certainly was more
anxiety-producing than we had anticipated, at least I had,
throughout the entire ascent. I had forgotten what it was like to
accelerate at 3 G's for a sustained period of time and how helpless
you really feel during that time period.
   Q. For Dave Hilmers, you've flown before but after this flight
is over what special moment do you want to tell your family about?
   Hilmers: Well, I think there are going to be an awful lot of
moments that I'm going to tell my family about, so many things that
we've showed up here. I think some of the Earth views that we've
seen and some of the nighttime scenes of the stars, those are just
so undescribable I wish that I could take the view that I actually
see rather than just pictures back to them, but I'll try my best to
describe them.
   Q. You guys didn't appear very busy up there at times. Was your
flight plan too conservative and would your time have been better
spent with a busier flight plan?
   Lounge: Well, I think we stayed pretty busy. Here on the middeck
we've done about 12 different scientific experiments of one sort or
another. And the days have seemed very full. In the future we hope
to get back into the business of putting on spacesuits and building
space stations and repairing satellites. But there's a lot of good
science that you can do right here in this facility you see us in
right now.
   Q. To follow on your opening and Dave's comments there a moment
ago, can you tell us specifically about some of the more
spectacular sights you've seen around the world? And let's go to
Pinky.
   Nelson: Well, I guess I'll divide it into three different parts.
In the daytime, we've had some spectacular passes across Africa
(transmission interrupted briefly) ... great shots of the ground.
At night, the indescribable views coming over South America. Huge
fires in the forests, and big cities down there. And the sky at
night is a completely different view. We spent some time just
looking with our eyes and some time looking with our
low-light-level camera that have given us some views. I always
enjoy seeing the Southern Hemisphere and have been dragging people
to the window showing them the Magellanic Clouds and the Southern
Cross.

   Q: I have a question for Rick and Dick. Can you give us some
idea of your flight plan for tomorrow, your landing patterns and
what landmarks you`ll be looking for as you come in?
   Hauck: We'll be coming in just about between Los Angeles and
Santa Barbara, overhead the coast at about 110,000 feet and
circling around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds
permit to land on Edwards runway 17. We'll pass overhead the field
at about 40,000 feet, becoming subsonic. You all can hear as we're
supersonic a double sonic boom. When you hear that, you'll know
we're about five minutes from landing. And then we'll make a
standard approach, 300 miles per hour, coming down to a touchdown
at 200 miles per hour on that lakebed.
   Q: For Mike Lounge. There are two men now running for president.
What would you say to them from the shuttle to convince them to
fully support the space program and its longterm future, even if it
means putting up budget increases for NASA in a time of
considerable deficits.
   Lounge: That's a tough one. I think we have to take the long
view. This is a very important flight simply because it's the first
step. I would hope that all of the enthusiasm that we've seen
throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens
and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if we're going to make
this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to get us on
the path to the future.
   Q: Gentlemen, the Challenger crew set out to teach some very
important lessons to the children of the world. I would like to
know what lessons you would hope would be taken from your flight
and the effort it took to get to where you are today?
   Covey: John, I've got a couple of young daughters and I know
what I would like them to learn from what I've done is that there
is always a reward for hard work, both individually and as a group,
much like the effort that was put forth by NASA and the contractors
to get the space shuttle flying again. And that there are new
adventures everywhere and space is one of them and hopefully that
all of the young children out there who want to come to space
someday will at least have the opportunity to try.
   Q: For Commander Hauck. Admiral Truly told us yesterday that
``NASA really threaded the needle on your launch.'' With the extra
emphasis on safety and a lot of flexibility, apparently, in the
launch schedule, do you think the launch came a little too close to
violating the safety criteria?
   Hauck: Oh, as I understand your question, do we think the launch
came too close to violating safety criteria. Not from my
perspective. That is, we were very comfortable with the liftoff as
it was executed. We thought the launch team, as a matter of fact
after main engine cutoff we were complimentary within ourselves to
the launch team and the way they handled a few minor annoyances
down close to the launch, the question of our cabin pressure and so
forth. From our perspective, we couldn't have been happier with the
way that launch went off and the countdown too.
   Q: I have a question for Pinky Nelson. As a trained research
scientist, can you tell us how well the several experiments that
you have managed could have been executed by automated equipment
with no people on board?
   Nelson: Well, to be honest with you a number of these could have
been run automated. The advantage of running them in the mode that
we have (interrupted by signal drop) ... Let me add one thing, and
that is all of the experiments that we brought on board this time
have exceeded my expectations in the way they have run.
   Q: Do you feel you have fulfilled all the objectives of the
mission and what, if any, recommendations do you have for changes
in the orbiter?
   Hauck: The machine worked superbly. I'm not sure that we've had
a mission that has been this trouble-free with an orbiter before.
Have to talk with the folks on the ground, I guess. We have flown
with our launch and entry suits for the first time since the first
four missions. We do find those to be a bit of an encumbrance.
We'll need to talk very seriously about whether there's a bit of a,
I'll call it, a bit of compromise that we would like to make. It's
certainly a trade between the advantage that the suit gives us
should we have a problem and the fact that it doesn't allow us
quite the flexibility that we had before. I guess that's the major
one. And I can't think of any others.
   Q: What's the Hispanic contribution to the space program so far?
   Hauck: Could you repeat the question please?
   Q: The question is what is the Hispanic contribution to
spaceflight before.
   Hauck: Well, I'd say there's no doubt about it that we've
hundreds of thousands of people out throughout the United States
that have worked on the space program and I think that every race,
every minority group is represented. They may not be represented to
the degree that that group might like, but I know that in our
travels throughout the country to the various centers and the
contractors, we have spoken with a number of Hispanics and many of
which we have worked closely with at the Johnson Space Center and I
think it's really a contribution of the American people that we're
really very proud of.
   Q: We've heard a lot in the last few days about the cabin
getting warm. Can you tell us how comfortable are you and the rest
of the crew as far as cabin temperature, and what kinds of things
are your doing to keep cool?
   Lounge: It was a little warmer than it is now in the first
couple of days of the flight because of the flash evaporator
problem. Today, we feel we've got that working pretty well. We've
been boiling water all day long to cool the vehicle and I put on a
long-sleeve shirt and we've all got long pants on for the first
time. It's not been bad at all, really.
   Q: Pinky, good wishes from everyone in Minnesota, especially our
home town in Willmar. Before you left, you said you were going to
monitor your own physical and mental responses to the liftoff phase
of the mission because you had not specific tasks. What did you
learn?
   Nelson: We're going to have a good tolerance for heat, I guess.
It's pretty warm in the suit. This is where I launched, there where
Dick Covey is sitting. I didn't have much of a view so I paid a lot
of attention to my body. It's difficult to breathe during the 3 G
part of the flight, mainly because of the weight of the suit and
the harness. You can feel a little bit of the inside of your body
shifting around with the weight and then shifting back again as the
engines cut off. I've got some more on my tape some place. I'll
have to tell you about it later.

<HEAD>Campaigning Ends With Pro-Pinochet Caravan, Skirmishes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a flurry of rallies, arrests and
speeches in the streets, campaigning was put on hold today while
Chileans prepared for a vote on extending right-wing Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's presidency to 1997.
   Police and some army troops were out in force.
   By law political campaigning ended on midnight Sunday, after a
massive pro-Pinochet caravan of cars, trucks and buses jammed the
capital's main boulevards and groups of opposition sympathizers
skirmished with riot police.
   Dozens were arrested in the skirmishes, according to preliminary
police reports. Helmeted riot officers used tear gas, water cannons
and nightsticks to disperse groups of Pinochet opponents on the
downtown streets.
   At least ten people were hurt, two seriously, in isolated
incidents throughout the day, including brawls between government
supporters and opponents.
   Hundreds of policemen patrolled the streets and were joined
Sunday by small army units, most of them manning machine guns
mounted on pickup trucks and other vehicles.
   The government has insisted that it will keep strict order
before and during Wednesday's referendum, in which the government
is asking Chileans to ratify a proposal by Pinochet and other
military commanders that he remain in power until 1997. The armed
forces has traditionally been charged with guarding elections in
Chile, where the last presidential ballot was in 1970.
   If a majority of the 7.4 million registered voters cast ``yes''
ballots, Pinochet will begin a new eight-year term in March. If
most vote ``no,'' an open presidential election will be held in
December 1989 and Pinochet will hand power over to the winner in
March 1990.
   In either case, elections for a congress are planned in a year.
   The legislature was disbanded when Pinochet, commander of the
powerful army, seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the
3-year-old elected government of President Salvador Allende, a
Marxist.
   However, the legislature will be virtually powerless to amend a
1980 constitution, crafted by Pinochet's administration, that gives
the military autonomy and a strong supervisory role in national
affairs.
   In Sunday's pro-government demonstration, tens of thousands of
horn-honking, flag-festooned cars, trucks and buses filled the
city's main boulevard and several other major thoroughfares.
   Lines of vehicles stretched for miles from the city's center,
especially on major roads to the affluent eastern suburbs. Huge
traffic jams were spawned as they attempted to converge shortly
after noon on the government palace in downtown Santiago, the
capital city that is home to more than 4 million of the country's
12 million people.
   ``Viva Pinochet,'' shouted participants, many of them young
people. They filled private cars, flatbed trucks and buses
decorated with red, white and blue national flags and posters
showing a smiling Pinochet in civilian dress.
   Loudspeakers atop many of the vehicles urged people to vote
``yes'' in the referendum, while drivers leaned constantly on their
horns.
   It was by far the biggest demonstration of voter support for
Pinochet, 72, who lags behind the opposition in most opinion polls.
A 16-party opposition coalition staged its final campaign event on
Saturday, drawing a crowd of hundreds of thousands of middle- and
working-class Chileans to an open-air rally.
   It was difficult to estimate attendance at Sunday's
demonstration, as participants in the caravan snaked through the
streets. Government-owned Radio Nacional of Santiago said 30,000
vehicles took part. A pro-government campaign spokesman claimed
that 700,000 people participated, but the figure appeared to be an
exaggeration.
   As the caravan broke up, groups of government opponents entered
the downtown on foot and in cars, chanting ``He's going to fall.''
Police sent them fleeing with tear gas and water cannons, but they
regrouped again and again, whistling in derision at the passing
cars of Pinochet backers.
   Pinochet recently has been easing political restrictions and
cultivating a conciliatory image that contrasts with his harshly
authoritarian reputation.
   He decreed an end to states of emergency in effect since he took
power and lifted a ban on the return of all leftists in exile. Many
of them were expelled or fled during a wave of fierce repression
that followed the coup.

   Q: We thought they were going to keep you on the ground at the
Cape because of high-level winds that were blowing in wrong
direction. During your ascent, could you tell that at all? Did it
have any effect whatsoever on the vehicle when you reached 30,000
to 40,000 foot?
   Hauck: No, those are forces that are masked and would be masked
by the vibrations that we feel just from the resonance and acoustic
vibrations from the solid rocket motors. We would not have expected
to feel them and we did not.
   Q: To Mike Lounge, in the opening comments you talked about the
Challenger dream being alive in your hearts. Since it appears
you've had a little extra time on this mission after the satellite
deployment on Thursday, I was wondering if you might be able to
share with us some of the heart-to-heart talks that you all have
had among yourselves during the flight.
   Lounge: Ah, no, probably not, those aren't the kinds of things
you share. We've done a lot of thinking about our friends that we
lost 2{ years ago, and I've done a lot of contemplating on that
personally as I'm drifting off to sleep at nights. And it's good to
be back where they wanted to go so badly.
   Q: For Rick or for Pinky. When it comes to safety and rescue, do
you think the United States should go together with Russia and
Europe and Canada and other countries? And if there should be some
standards?
   Nelson: If the question is how are we going to handle
international cooperation within our own program, I think you do
that through planning ahead of time, through standards that you set
and through the procedures that you use so that by the time you get
around to flying with an international group, or international
crew, you're all working with the same procedures, you all have the
same knowledge and capabilities of carrying those out so that
there's really going to be no difference among the crew whether
it's all American or has internationals on board.
   Q: Could you appraise the mission management team process before
liftoff, and whether you can tell your colleagues who will follow
you if it works well.
   Hauck: Well, this gives me an opportunity to thank my good
friend Captain Bob Crippen for the outstanding job that he did from
our perspective in pulling that all together. And this didn't all
just happen, of course, in the last few days before the launch. It
was a many-month effort and I thought that management team _ of all
that I saw in close at the FRRs for the main engine firings and
FRRs for the orbiter itself _ I was just very happy, and I think
that bodes very well for the way we do business.
   Q: You've been taking photos of phenomena on Earth such as
volcanoes in Africa and hurricane damage in Mexico. What have you
observed there that might be of value to those areas?
   Hilmers: Well, I think some of the biggest things that we've
seen are things like deforestations, we've seen erosion, we've seen
some land usage that kind of disturbs us. And I think the good
lesson is that we take back these photos to men on Earth in their
respective countries to make sure that they take care of what
nature has given them and to make sure it is used wisely. Our
environment is a very fragile thing and I think that's something
that we're very impressed by when we take photos and as we look out
the window.
   Q: Have you caught yourself being so excited at times or other
crew members around you that you've had to subdue yourself?
   Hauck: Yes, yes we do. As a matter of fact it's good that we're
_ I think if we were a crew of one, the possibility of getting
distracted by the beautiful sights and the fun of being up here
could perhaps cause you to not pay enough attention to what you're
doing. The crew concept is a wonderful thing and it keeps us on our
toes.
   Q: On liftoff day, there was an agreement signed in Washington
between Europe, Japan, Canada and United States about Freedom, the
space station. Do you have any comment on that?
   Hauck: I think that's great. That just means we can pull
together even more time working on the same problems and the same
solutions and if there's a team up here that can get a lot more
done than five people individually, there's no question that the
unique cultures that each of the international partners bring to
this effort will be synergistic and make the whole bigger than the
sum of the parts.
   Q: What do you think now, Pinky, about the future of the space
shuttle as a platform for scientific platform?
   Nelson: I think the future is bright for a scientific use for
the space shuttle. As I mentioned before, the middeck that we're in
is really a national resource. Many scientists will be glad to have
a room this size with zero gravity inside it that has electricity
and water available for them to do their experiments in. I think it
will be used extensively in the future, probably primarily as a
development lab, as a test bed for experiments such as the ones
we've got on board where prototypes can be tested and where new
concepts can be proven that can then later be developed and
expanded and put into free-flying satellites or put on board the
space station in production facilities.
   Q: As you get ready for landing, do the problems with the flash
evaporator system and one of the OMS rockets concern you, if no why
not.
   Hauck: Well of course, they're something that concerns you if
you have the next failure. Our understanding right now is that the
flash evaporator, though, we expect it to work almost fully up to
its potential and we could sustain another failure and still be in
good shape. That's also the case with the orbital maneuvering
engines. It's true that we do have one thrust vector control system
down on the last engine, but we have a backup and we also have the
capability of locking that control system in its current position
and still de-orbit, plus we could shut down one engine and come
back on the other engine and if that would fail, we could come back
on the reaction control system. So we have quite a backup
capability there.''

   Following are the 13 appropriations bills for
the 1989 fiscal year, which began Saturday, with the dates they
were enacted into law and the amounts of new spending they
provided. The bills are needed to pay for the functioning of
federal agencies.

   A pipe bomb exploded in a residential
neighborhood Sunday night, killing an 8-year-old boy and injuring
five other children, authorities said.
   ``There's some kids that found a pipe bomb,'' said Lt. R.C. Swan
of the Fort Worth Fire Department. ``One of them was killed when it
went off.''
   Ambulances took three children to Harris Methodist Hospital and
two to John Peter Smith Hospital, Swan said.
   The bomb exploded in front of a home in a neighborhood of
single-family residences near a light industrial area on the city's
south side. The children found the device alongside a curb, said
Capt. Roy Knight of the fire department.
   Investigators recovered some fragments of the pipe bomb, but
Knight said he didn't know what the device was made of or contained.
   Swan said no fire occurred as a result of the explosion.
   Information on what happened was sketchy Sunday night because
the injured children were still being treated, and three were in
serious condition, hospital officials said. The name of the dead
child was not immediately released.
   Mark Zamora, 7, was in serious condition with eye and facial
injuries, said Michael Mayo, night administrator at John Peter
Smith Hospital.
   Irena Herrera, 4, also was in serious condition with injuries in
her abdominal area and lower extremities and a fractured left leg,
Mayo said.
   Mark's 8-year-old brother, Joel, was in serious condition with
eye injuries at Harris Methodist Hospital was in serious condition
with eye injuries, said emergency room spokeswoman Ruth McFadden.
His sister, Jael Zamora, 11, was in good condition with
lacerations, Ms. McFadden said.
   Irena's 6-year-old brother, Rudy, was also in good condition
with lacerations and facial powder burns, the spokeswoman said.
   Ms. McFadden said Jael told authorities that the children were
playing with the bomb when it went off.

<HEAD>Ticket? Anybody Got a Ticket to the Dukakis Rally? Check with the
Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A ticket to a Michael Dukakis rally
is easier to come by than one for a Boston Red Sox home game or a
performance of ``Les Miserables.'' And a lot cheaper, too.
   What makes a Dukakis ticket unusual is that people need one at
all.
   In fact, they do if they want to be right down front, within
cheering distance of the Democratic presidential candidate.
   Or, in this campaign, it might be more appropriate to say within
heckling distance of the candidate.
   Immediately after Labor Day, Dukakis began encountering intense
heckling, particularly from anti-abortion activists.
   He had to fight to be heard during an appearance in early
September in Niles, Ill.
   The campaign decided something had to be done. Their response
was to rope off the area closest to the podium and require tickets
for admission.
   Even students at Rutgers University needed tickets to get close
to Dukakis when he delivered a speech on the environment.
   In that case, a ticket got a little star quality because actor
Robert Redford introduced the candidate.
   Tickets also were required for rallies in Melrose Park, Ill.;
Jersey City, N.J.; and Greensburg, Pa.
   The tickets were free, obtained from elected and party officials
or from unions.
   So, at each rally, the people down front were reliably
enthusiastic for the candidate and cheered at every jibe against
Republican George Bush, their response usually drowning out the
chants of Bush supporters relegated to the fringes of the crowd.
   Another tool used to control hecklers is loud speakers, the huge
kind, usually found at events like rock concerts.
   A bank of mega-decibel speakers placed at the rear of the crowd
assures that the candidate's voice will be heard above the chants
of any hecklers.
   At Rutgers, someone neglected to provide quite enough speakers
and Dukakis had to contend with a large group of pro-Bush students
who chanted, ``Borrrring, borrrring,'' and recited the Pledge of
Allegiance to the flag.
   But they didn't have tickets, so they were too far from the
podium to effectively disrupt his speech.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   During a campaign stop in Idalou, Texas, reporters traveling
with Dukakis were delighted to receive colorful bandanas, some red,
some blue.
   Several reporters were wearing them when they got off the plane
with Dukakis in Ontario, Calif. The entourage went off to tour the
Stringfellow toxic waste dump.
   The next stop was a nearby high school and a Secret Service
agent asked the reporters to take off their bandanas.
   He said local gangs _ the Crips and Bloods _ wear colored
bandanas to identify themselves. The agent said local police were
concerned that seeing reporters wearing the scarves would encourage
the practice among students.

<TEXT>
   For two weeks, Dukakis kept his distance from reporters, a
tactic reflecting concern that responses to questions often were
overshadowing the messages in his speeches.
   When he held a news conference in Dallas, a reporter asked if
the reduced access to the candidate was a shift in attitude.
   The candidate smiled, shrugged and pointed out that he was
answering questions at that very moment.
   ``Take advantage of the opportunity,'' he said. ``You never know
when it will happen again.''
   When the news conference ended and he was leaving the room, a
reporter shouted, ``See you next month, governor.''

   For the United Nations, last week was a
week of champagne and euphoria. Even the U.N. fountain, dry for
three years of financial drought, was splashing again in the autumn
air _ a sign of happy times.
   There was the Nobel Peace Prize for U.N. peacekeeping and the
farewell speech of President Reagan, who finally praised the world
body.
   Reagan and other speakers hailed peace agreements, talks or
prospects of peace in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war, Southern
Africa and Namibia, Cambodia and the Western Sahara _ conflicts in
which the United Nations has played or will play a major role
resolving.
   So popular is the United Nations that Britain and Iran chose it
as the forum to announce the resumption of full diplomatic
relations.
   China and the Soviet Union chose it to announce the first
working visit of a Chinese foreign minister to Moscow since the
1950s, a major step toward a Sino-Soviet summit.
   At the United Nations, Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers also
discussed Cambodia, signaling a new impetus by the communist rivals
to solve the problem of Vietnamese occupation.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Democratic
Presidential Candidate Michael Dukakis chose the General Assembly
and the nearby Waldorf Astoria to meet.
   Even the fountain in the U.N. Plaza, turned off in a fiscal
austerity drive, was turned on in a sign that the United Nations
has received both a little more money from the United States and
other indebted nations, and a lot more respect.
   The high point of the week was Thursday, when the Nobel Peace
Prize was awarded to U.N. peacekeeping operations worldwide for 40
years. The Nobel Prize committee cited recent U.N. achievements in
mediating an Afghan agreement and in arranging a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   While celebrating the Nobel Peace Prize with champagne, U.N.
officials warned the United Nations still has a beer pocketbook
because the organization owes nearly $600 million.
   The three-week General Debate, a parade of world leaders, began
Monday when President Reagan addressed the General Assembly of 159
nations and, in a dramatic turnabout, conceded the organization he
criticized for seven years was doing a good job.
   ``Yes, the United Nations is a better place today,'' Reagan
said, ``but so, too, is the world.''
   Reagan's administration had debunked the organization for
anti-Western bias, ineffectiveness and wasteful bureaucracy.
   Other speakers lauded the United Nations.
   They also covered the full range of standard problems, from
apartheid to Third World debt but the tone was far less contentious
than in previous years, reflecting the improvement in East-West
relations.
   There was special emphasis on strengthening the existing ban on
chemical weapons and Reagan called for an international conference
in Paris on the outlawed weapons. President Francois Mitterand of
France urged embargos of chemical weapons materials to offending
states.
   The environment was a major topic and for the first time,
Shevardnadze devoted a major portion of his General Assembly speech
to the ozone layer, the biosphere, acid rain, dying seas and dying
fauna.
   For the Soviets, it was a major shift in focus, a joining of the
international ecological movement as it seeks to extricate itself
from regional conflicts and improve relations with Washington and
Beijing.
   But there were problems and embarrassments, too, signs of
limitations of the world organization.
   Just hours after champagne flowed to celebrate the Nobel Peace
Prize announcement, the Soviet Union said the U.N.'s tiny 50-man
observer force in Afghanistan and Pakistan was ``not doing a good
job.''
   Shevardnadze told the permanent members of the Security Council
that the U.N. team has failed to investigate flagrant violations of
the Afghanistan agreements by Pakistan for allegedly training and
arming Afghan rebels.
   And while a U.N.-supervised cease-fire was holding on the
Iran-Iraq war front, talks toward a permanent peace have dragged
into their second month.
   Both sides have been intransigient, after Iraq introduced the
issue of sovereignty over the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway and
insisted on early U.N. dredging before proceeding with talks on
other issues.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Opponents of apartheid denounced
President P.W. Botha's courtship of black Africa as ``sheer
hypocrisy'' after he returned from Zaire, his third summit with a
black African leader in as many weeks.
   An official of the outlawed African National Congress, fighting
South Africa's white-minority government, on Sunday condemned
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire for meeting Botha over the
weekend.
   Botha said the increasingly open contacts between South Africa
and its black neighbors discredited the sanctions campaign waged
against South Africa by Western countries opposed to apartheid,
South Africa's system of racial segregation.
   In his recent visits to Mozambique, Malawi and Zaire, Botha has
not been met by demands from black leaders for political changes.
Their public criticisms of apartheid have also been mild or
non-existent.
   One of Botha's chief foreign policy goals has been to expand
ties with black Africa without having to promise concessions to the
disenfranchised black majority in his own country.
   However, Mobutu made it clear that he pressed the issue of
jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela during the private talks with
Botha on Saturday.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, would neither
confirm nor deny reports that President Botha promised the
unconditional release of Mandela during the Zaire meeting.
   Zaire Radio in Kinshasa on Sunday called the meeting a
diplomatic triumph, furthering Mobutu's efforts to bring peace to
southern Africa, where a civil war is going on in Marxist-led
Angola and guerrillas are fighting South African rule of South-West
Africa.
   But Stanley Mabizela, the ANC's chief representative in
Zimbabwe, said African leaders should shun Botha because he
``executes people who are victims of an inhuman society, as well as
political prisoners.''
   South Africa's largest-selling black newspaper, City Press,
described the visit to Zaire as ``sheer hypocrisy.
   ``What is the point of achieving peace and stability with
neighbors when your own country is engulfed in flames?'' the paper
asked in an editorial Sunday.
   Apartheid must be abolished and negotiations held with
legitimate black leaders, City Press said. ``Until these minimum
demands are met, Mr. Botha can tour the rest of Africa as much as
he likes _ peace will not come to this country.''
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   The summit also drew criticism in Zaire, where police fired on a
crowd of about 200 university students protesting Botha's visit.
Professors on Sunday said two of the protesters were wounded.
   But Botha said he planned more trips in Africa soon.
   Last month, Botha traveled to Mozambique and invited its
president, Joaquim Chissano, to visit South Africa. Both Chissano
and Mobutu accepted the invitations, although no dates for their
visits were set.
   No black African leader has made a state visit to South Africa
since Botha took power in 1978.
   Mobutu was quoted Sunday by The Washington Post as saying he won
``a firm commitment'' from Botha that Mandela, 70, will be freed
soon after he recovers from tuberculosis, and be allowed to return
to home.
   Botha has offered previously to release Mandela in exchange for
Mandela's renunciation of violence. Mandela, recuperating from
tuberculosis in Cape Town, has refused to repudiate the violent
tactics of the ANC, which he led until he was jailed 26 years ago.

<HEAD>Bentsen, Quayle Often on Same Side in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Dan Quayle of
Indiana have voted together for the Reagan tax cuts, military aid
to the Contras, money for the MX missile and the death penalty for
drug-related murders.
   On such issues as defense and capital punishment, in fact,
Bentsen's voting record is at odds not with Quayle, but with his
own running mate, Michael Dukakis. Quayle, on the other hand, has
little apparent quarrel with any of George Bush's positions.
   Still, the two vice presidential candidates have often found
themselves at loggerheads, including a recent battle over whether
to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings.
   As they gird for their nationally televised debate in Omaha,
Neb., Wednesday night, each will be probing the other's record for
points of attack.
   For the younger, less experienced Republican, whose credentials
the Democrats have ridiculed, the debate may also be an opportunity
to emphasize those issues where he, Bush and Bentsen are of one
mind _ and Dukakis is of another.
   But there will also be ample opportunity for Bentsen to point
out stark differences between his and Quayle's voting records on
social programs, labor issues, civil rights, education, energy and
other matters.
   Bentsen, 67, has served nearly 24 years in Congress, twice as
long as his 41-year-old rival, and the Texan is near the pinnacle
of the Senate power structure as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   In this year alone, Bentsen has been the Democrats' point man in
successful efforts to enact major legislation on trade,
catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and the nation's
welfare programs.
   A defense-minded Texas Tory, Bentsen was pushing for tax cuts _
including a lower capital gains tax _ back in the late 1970s during
the Carter administration, when he chaired the Joint Economic
Committee.
   Quayle is a back-bench Republican who sits on the Armed
Services, Budget and Labor and Human Services committees. His main
legislative accomplishment during eight years in the Senate was the
Job Training Partnership Act of 1983.
   He made that legislative effort, with support from a liberal
Democrat, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, over the
reservations of the Reagan administration.
   Quayle has been a stalwart supporter of the Strategic Defense
Initiative. But Bentsen also supports it. Like Bentsen, Quayle
voted in 1986 to override Reagan's veto of a bill imposing
sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime.
   On the campaign trail, Quayle almost never mentions Bentsen,
while constantly pillorying Dukakis as weak on defense and as
merely another ``inexperienced liberal governor'' like Jimmy
Carter, the last Democrat to occupy the White House.
   But as a freshman member of the House in 1977, Quayle supported
Carter's plan to kill the B-1 bomber. In the pivotal vote, Quayle
and seven other Republicans sided with the Democrats on a 202-199
showdown on the issue. Reagan revived the B-1 when he took office,
and all 100 bombers now have been built.
   Quayle voted to sustain Reagan's veto this year of the Civil
Rights Restoration Act; Bentsen voted for the successful override.
   On the plant closing notification law, Quayle was the leading
opponent and Bentsen the leading proponent. Quayle argued it would
impose ``a legislative straitjacket on industry'' and ``impede our
capacity to compete in world markets.''
   Bentsen and Quayle debated the issue last April 22 on public
television's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. Reagan later vetoed the trade
bill because it contained the 60-day notice provision.
   But Bentsen and fellow Democrats came back with separate trade
and plant closing notification bills. Reagan eventually signed the
trade bill and let the plant closing notification measure become
law without his signature.
   Bentsen and Quayle were on opposite sides of this year's effort
in Congress to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage for the first
time since 1981.
   Quayle, after initially resisting any increase, supported a
compromise including a sub-minimum training wage for teen-agers.
Quayle says he now supports a $4 minimum wage, but says what the
working poor really need is better training and education, not a
higher minimum wage.
   There will be no increase in the minimum wage this year,
however. Faced with the threat of a Republican filibuster and
unwilling to accept a sub-minimum wage for teens, Senate Democrats
recently dropped efforts to raise the minimum to $4.55.
   Bentsen votes most of the time with the Democratic majority, but
he has broken ranks to support Reagan requests on Contra aid, SDI
and the MX mobile missile.
   Quayle was an outspoken opponent of legislation to ban the use
of lie detectors in the workplace, and he complained when the White
House dropped its opposition last March that it had ``caved like a
house of cards.'' Bentsen supported the bill.
   Bentsen and Quayle were on opposite sides of the Senate's May 9,
1985 vote for a one-year budget freeze _ including Social Security
_ that passed 50-49, with Bush casting the tie-breaker. But while
Bentsen voted against a freeze on that occasion, he voted twice in
1984 and 1985 for other freeze proposals that would have delayed
Social Security cost-of-living increases for six or 12 months.
   On other issues:
   _Bentsen has voted in favor of prayer in public schools and for
a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget _ both of which
are opposed by Dukakis and supported by Bush and Quayle.
   _Bentsen, the Texan, also favors an oil import fee, which
Dukakis, Bush and Quayle oppose.
   _The Democrat senator sided with Quayle and most Republicans to
kill a six-month extension of the amnesty period for illegal
immigrants.
   _Quayle voted for the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme
Court; Bentsen voted with the Senate majority to reject it.
   _The Republican led a successful fight in 1986 to win
confirmation of Daniel Manion to a seat on a federal appeals bench
in Indiana. Critics had challenged the conservative lawyer's
credentials. Bentsen voted against Manion.
   Quayle says he opposes abortion except to save a mother's life,
and he has voted for an anti-abortion constitutional amendment and
against federal funding of abortions. Bentsen also says he
personally opposes abortion and federal funding except in cases of
rape, incest or to save a mother's life. But he has often voted
against restrictions on funding and has voted against a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
   The centrist Bentsen got identical ratings from the AFL-CIO and
the American Conservative Union in 1986: 50 percent from each.
Quayle got a grade of 82 percent from the conservative group, but
only an 8 percent from the labor federation.

<HEAD>Milosevic Strengthens Hand Before Oct. 17 Showdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IVAN STEFANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Serbian leader hailed by
supporters as ``the second Tito'' has moved closer to regaining
Serbian control over two provinces and is strengthening his hand
inside the divided Communist leadership.
   Slobodan Milosevic was given a boost last week with the
resignation of two political rivals and formal party backing for
Serbia's demands to absorb Vojvodina and Kosovo provinces.
   The moves have given Milosevic ammunition that will be useful in
a major political showdown expected at a Central Committee meeting
Oct. 17.
   On Friday, the Communist party's Presidium, or politburo,
approved Serbia's drive to tighten control over the two provinces,
apparently bowing to the pressure exerted by hundreds of thousands
of Slavs at almost daily rallies.
   Late Saturday, the state news agency Tanjug announced the
resignation from the powerful 23-man Poliburo of Bosko Krunic, who
until July held the annually rotating leadership of Yugoslavia's
ruling Communist party.
   Krunic's resignation followed the similarly sudden exit of Franc
Setinc, a Communist leader from the liberal northern republic of
Slovenia, last Monday.
   Setinc resigned in a public letter attacking the ``insanity'' of
emotional mass rallies by Milosevic supporters, who frequently have
called for the ouster of Krunic and other Communist leaders.
   Ostensibly, the rallies _ which drew at least another 100,000
Slavs on to the streets this weekend _ are held to express support
for the Serbs and Montenegrins in ethnically troubled Kosovo, where
Slavs allege daily harassment by the Albanian majority.
   The emotional crowds wave portraits of the 47-year-old
Milosevic, lauding the leader of Serbia's Communist party for his
drive to reimpose full Serbian control over Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   Since the rallies started in July, however, they have become a
vehicle for expression of popular discontent with the party's
inability to end a protracted economic and social crisis.
   The annually rotating collective leadership of the country and
the party bequeathed by the late Josip Broz Tito before he died in
1980 has failed to come to grips with Yugoslavia's problems.
   This weekend, inflation officially hit 217 percent. Unemployment
stands at 15 percent. An austerity program adopted last May to
repay the $21 billion foreign debt is to be modified next week,
with the government again trying to stave off worker unrest by
giving way to demands for higher wages to cope with spiraling price
hikes.
   In this chaos, Milosevic has skilfully used the emotional issue
of Kosovo to unite many hundreds of thousands of Serbs behind him
and to appear to them as the strong political leader needed to rule
as effectively as Tito.
   Arguably Yugoslavia's most backward region, Kosovo was once the
heart of Serbia's medieval empire. To the mostly Christian Slavs,
it symbolizes Serbia's most glorious days.
   But the province is now dominated by mostly Moslem ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people and
have the highest birthrate in Europe.
   The Slavs resent how the Albanians have used Tito's 1974
constitution, which granted broad powers to the autonomous
provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   Serbs allege that the Albanians seek even greater autonomy in
the form of a full-fledged republic. If this happens, Serbs argue,
the republic would instantly secede and unite with neighboring
Communist Albania, precipitating Yugoslavia's disintegration.
   By taking up the cause of Kosovo's Serbs, Milosevic can thus
argue that he is acting not simply for the benefit of the Slavs but
to preserve the six republics that comprise Yugoslavia.
   In the republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina,
party leaders are suspicious of Milosevic and traditionally wary of
Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's republics.
   Bosnia-Herzegovina posted police on its borders last month to
stop potential pro-Milosevic demonstrators from rallying there.
   DANAS, an influential Croatian weekly, wondered aloud in its
latest issue ``Who Will Say Enough?'' to protest rallies.
   Both the state presidency and the party Presidium have urged
Yugoslavs not to attend the massive rallies.
   But Milosevic never asked his supporters to go home and his
recalcitrance now seems to have paid off.
   At Friday's Presidium meeting, state president Raif Dizdarevic
said the proposals for changes granting Serbia greater control are
``an acceptable basis'' for discussion.
   Replied Milosevic: ``It is with great satisfaction that we heard
encouragement today.''

<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motor homes, many
festooned with American flags, stretched for four miles along a dry
lake bed Sunday as thousands of people camped out waiting to see
space shuttle Discovery land.
   ``This is what America's all about,'' said Vic Failla, 61, of La
Verne, a World War II veteran who brought his brother Tony to see
the shuttle end its four-day flight at this air base in the Mojave
Desert 80 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Touchdown is scheduled for Monday at 9:37 a.m. PDT.
   Recreational vehicles streamed into the eastern shoreline of
Rogers Dry Lake on a ribbon of heat-rippled two-lane blacktop lined
by twisted Joshua trees and surrounded by rattlesnake-infested
desert.
   Across the dry lake bed, the Air Force Base hangars glistened in
102-degree heat. As night fell, temperatures dipped into the 70s
and the bright lights of the base could be seen across the lake bed
from the spectator encampment.
   Many of the campers enjoyed candlelight dinners inside their

<HEAD>Quayle Not Worried About Making Gaffes in Debate, But Says He'll
Be Nervous</HEAD>

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, conceding he could make one of his celebrated gaffes at
Wednesday's debate with Lloyd Bentsen, says he'll be fighting off
butterflies but will be ready for the critical confrontation.
   ``I will be prepared. I'll be ready,'' he vowed during a
pre-debate interview with The Associated Press.
   Polls show many voters are skeptical about Quayle's
qualifications, and Quayle said he sees the debate as his ``golden
opportunity'' to resolve their doubts. But the Indiana senator
sought to play down the debate's impact on the election.
   ``It is important and the American people will be able to see
the two vice presidential nominees,'' he said. ``But when they go
in that voting booth they're going to be voting for a president of
the United States, and that's where their attention is going to be
and that's where the election is going to be decided.''
   Quayle will focus his attacks on Democrat Michael Dukakis rather
than the Texas senator, whom Quayle sees as more in tune with
Republicans than Democrats.
   ``The opponent for me is Michael Dukakis. He's the one that's
running for president. He's the one that if he would get in, I
think it'd be very difficult time for this country. The senator
from Texas is the vice presidential nominee, and my target and my
discussion and my focus that evening will be on the governor from
Massachusetts,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle will field the first question from the panel of
journalists at the Omaha, Neb., debate. He has been closeted with
top advisers at an undisclosed location in the Washington area
boning up on the issues and conducting mock debates with Bentsen's
stand-in, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   He admits to some nervousness, but says that should evaporate.
   ``I won't really get the butterflies going probably until
Wednesday. But they'll be there. There's no doubt,'' he said,
adding that he expects to be ``very much in control'' by the time
the debate begins.
   Quayle's embattled tenure as George Bush's running mate has been
marked by intense media scrutiny into his military service,
academic record and personal life. He has made a number of
high-profile gaffes _ telling reporters at one point ``I didn't
live in this century,'' among other things.
   ``The problem is that every time there's just one little miscue
it gets amplified as if this is the standard operating procedure,
which it's not,'' he said.
   But Quayle said he is not worried about making such ``miscues''
on Wednesday.
   ``The reason I'm not is because it's going to be questions and
answers. There's always that possibility, but I'm a very confident
person,'' he said. ``And the American people will be able to see me
in an unedited version for the first time since New Orleans, and
it's going to be a great opportunity for me.''
   GOP strategists have said that because Quayle has been portrayed
as a caricature and lightweight candidate he should benefit from
the low expecations for his performance. In essence, they suggest,
anything short of a major blunder will allow him to come away
looking good.
   ``I'm treating it as an opportunity to get up there, respond to
the questions, tell the American people where I want to lead this
country with George Bush ... and articulate a vision for the
future. So I don't look at it as low expectations, high
expectations. I'll leave that to others,'' Quayle said. ``What I
perceive this debate as is a golden opportunity for me to just be
myself.''
   Aides have said they want Quayle to tone down his boyish
exuberance so he will appear dignified and mature beside the
67-year-old Bentsen. They are said to be advising him to speak
slower and perhaps to rein in the wild gesticulating he sometimes
exhibits.
   But Quayle said he is not worried about looking less experienced
than Bentsen, who has 18 years in the Senate and speaks with a
dignified and patrician air.
   ``Age alone is not the only qualification for vice president or
president. You have to look at experience, you've got to look at
judgment, you've got to look if you can make a difference. I
believe I can make a difference ... like I have made a difference
in areas like job training and national defense,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kennedy Could Be Key Vote on Major Supreme Court Decisions This
Term</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Will stand</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy may hold the
decisive vote on such issues as civil rights, affirmative action,
the death penalty and drug-testing that the Supreme Court will take
up in its new term beginning today.
   Many experts say Kennedy, beginning his first full term since
becoming a justice last February, could determine whether the
court's erratic 20-year drift toward conservatism will accelerate
dramatically.
   Over the next nine months, the court has agreed to rule on these
issues:
   _The death penalty for convicted murderers who committed their
crimes before reaching age 18.
   _The death penalty for mentally retarded killers.
   _The power of local governments to require that a certain
percentage of public works projects be awarded to minority-owned
construction businesses.
   _Mandatory drug testing for railroad employees involved in
serious accidents and for people seeking drug-enforcement jobs
within the U.S. Customs Service.
   _The continued vitality of a 1976 Supreme Court decision used to
fight private, or non-governmental, racial discrimination.
   The court could be deeply divided on each issue.
   ``We're not sure where he lines up,'' Thomas Krattenmaker, dean
of the Georgetown University Law School, said of Kennedy. ``It will
be interesting to see whether Kennedy takes the middle road or opts
for a more ideological route.''
   An anticipated bellwether for Kennedy and the court is a North
Carolina case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment.
The justices, with Kennedy on the side of the majority, voted 5-4
last April to use the case to reconsider a 1976 decision called
Runyon vs. McCrary.
   In the 1976 decision, the court said racially segregated private
schools violate federal civil rights law when they refuse to admit
black students. The ruling let civil rights groups use that law as
a weapon in attacking other forms of private bias as well.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun recently told a group of law students
in Arkansas, ``I think the outcome of the case will be of some
significance as to the movement of the court during the balance of
the 20th century.''
   Marsha Levick, executive director of the National Organization
for Women's legal arm, said Kennedy's votes in the North Carolina
case and other pending civil rights disputes are key.
   ``Anthony Kennedy is absolutely someone to watch. He has not
been generous in his reading of civil rights laws'' as a federal
appeals court judge, she said.
   Blackmun, author of the high court's 1973 decision legalizing
abortion, told his Arkansas audience that Kennedy's views on the
issue _ as yet unknown _ could put the landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling
in jeopardy if a new abortion case wins the court's review.
   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?' I
think there's a very distinct possibility it will _ this term,''
Blackmun said.
   Four court members _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor _
have criticized the 1973 decision.
   Krattenmaker warned against judging Kennedy by his initial
votes, noting that in his early years on the court Blackmun was
considered a staunch conservative but is now viewed as a leading
liberal on many issues.
   Noting that Blackmun soon will be 80 and that the court's two
leading liberals, Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall, are in their 80s, Krattenmaker said, ``We must look for
signs or signals that one or more of the justices is considering
retirement.''
   The court's conservatives are much younger. Rehnquist is 63,
White 71, Scalia 52, O'Connor 58, and Kennedy 52.
   The court's ninth member, Justice John Paul Stevens, is 68.
   Here, in summary form, are some of the cases the Supreme Court
is expected to decide this term:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEATH PENALTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Should capital punishment be banned for all murderers not yet
18 when they committed their crime? The court came close to
deciding the issue last June but its deliberations in an Oklahoma
case yielded no clear majority position. Kennedy did not
participate in that case but will take part in deciding similar
cases from Georgia and Missouri this term.
   _Should mentally retarded killers be executed for their crimes?
The court is studying the case of a Texas murderer who has the
mental capacity of a 7-year-old.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May local governments require minority participation in public
works projects? The justices will resolve an attempt by Richmond,
Va., authorities to revive a so-called set-aside program that
required the prime contractor on any city building contract to
subcontract at least 30 percent of the project's value to firms
that are at least one-half minority owned.
   _May whites who claim they are the victims of ``reverse
discrimination'' challenge a court-approved plan between the
Birmingham, Ala., Fire Department and black firefighters to promote
more blacks?
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUG TESTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Is it an impermissible invasion of privacy rights to require
people seeking drug-enforcement jobs with the U.S. Customs Service
to undergo drug tests in which urine samples are taken?
   _May the nation's railroads require all employees involved in
serious accidents to undergo mandatory drug tests?
   Other drug-testing controversies, affecting many more people,
are waiting in the wings.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CRIMINAL LAW</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Is a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal
crimes valid? The validity of the U.S. Sentencing Commission that
fashioned those rules also is at issue _ and at stake are sentences
already meted out for tens of thousands of convicted criminals.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FREE SPEECH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May states use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult
bookstores accused of selling obscene materials even before those
materials are officially judged to be obscene? The court's ruling
in an Indiana case could affect anti-pornography efforts in other
states as well.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FAMILIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May states block a man from trying to prove he fathered the
child of a woman married to someone else? California, as do most
other states, gives a conclusive presumption of fatherhood to a
wife's husband and thus blocks others from claiming paternity.
   _May unwed fathers who actively seek custody of their children
be stripped of all parental rights if adoption is deemed to be in
the child's best interests? A case from California.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LIABILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May public officials be sued for their alleged negligence in
permitting a child to be abused by a parent? The Wisconsin case
gives the court an opportunity to study the phenomenon of holding
public officials accountable for their failure to take certain
actions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SEXUAL BIAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _How difficult should it be for a woman to prove she was
illegally discriminated against because of her employer's
``unconscious stereotyping.'' The court will study the District of
Columbia case of a woman who says she was denied an accounting firm
partnership because her bosses believed she acted too aggressively
for a woman.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the Soviet bloc's only
independent national youth group said the group would benefit from
the sweeping political changes engineered by Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in the Soviet Union last weekend.
   Gabor Fodor of the Union of Young Democrats, or FIDESZ, said the
strengthening of Gorbachev's power in the Soviet Union would boost
the reform wing of Hungary's Communist Party, which would in turn
give the youth group freer reign.
   ``They (the authorities) won't attack FIDESZ as hard and will
allow it to work,'' Fodor said Sunday.
   Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist Party leader, engineered a major
overhaul of the Soviet power structure in which he also assumed the
presidency, the top government.
   FIDESZ was established in March as an alternative to Hungary's
communist youth group, KISZ, which had lost thousands of members in
recent years. Communist officials initially branded FIDESZ illegal
and pressured it to cease its activities.
   Later, authorities softened their criticisms.
   About 700 people attended a two-day meeting over the weekend at
Budapest's Jurta theater to discuss the statutes of FIDESZ. Fodor,
a member of the group's six-man governing body, said the first
congress was a ``school of democracy for us.''
   He said the political weight of the organization is stronger
than its membership of about 1,500 indicates.
   ``The authorities are afraid of us because we are young and have
a clean slate,'' Fodor said.
   Janos Lukacs, a member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo,
told a Central Committee meeting last week that FIDESZ was
attempting to ``thwart dialogue'' and rejected what he called the
``aggressive stand'' of the group.
   Laszlo Koever, another founder of FIDESZ, countered that the
party leadership should be happy about the spread of grassroots
organizations and should recognize FIDESZ's readiness for dialogue.
   FIDESZ hopes to become fully legal under a new law of
association and assembly to be passed by parliament in December.
   Fodor said FIDESZ supports the reform wing of the Communist
Party, most closely identified with Politburo members Imre Pozsgay
and Reszo Nyers.
   On Sept. 12, Pozsgay, who was promoted to the Politburo in a
power shuffle in May, received a five-member delegation from FIDESZ.
   Fodor, who was a member of the delegation, said Pozsgay advised
the group not to press certain issues he said they could not
achieve progress on now, such as a re-evaluation of the 1956
anti-Communist revolt or a withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   However, Pozsgay did not suggest the group stop its activities,
Fodor said.
   FIDESZ is to hold a second congress in November to adopt a final
political program.
   Peter Veres, a spokesman for the group, said FIDESZ advocates a
multiparty system and decreased defense spending and would like to
field candidates for parliament.

<HEAD>U.S. To Begin Contra Training Programs Under New Aid Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration expects to be able
to institute non-military training programs for the Nicaraguan
Contras under a new humanitarian aid package, U.S. officials say.
   The old aid program, which expired last Friday, allowed the
administration to use the $17.7 million package only for food,
clothing, medical services and shelter.
   The new $27 million, six-month package signed into law by
President Reagan on Saturday calls for assistance in the same four
areas, but the word ``only'' has been deleted. That will permit the
administration greater flexibility in how the money is spent.
   In signing the $14.3 billion foreign aid bill, Reagan criticized
what he said was a minimal amount of humanitarian aid for the
Contras.
   U.S. officials, speaking only on condition they not be named,
said they envision U.S.-sponsored ``skills training'' in areas
ranging from radio maintenance to record keeping, human rights and
health care.
   The officials said such programs should boost the morale of the
thousands of rebels who are camped along the Honduran-Nicaraguan
border.
   Many of the rebels flocked to these camps from inside Nicaragua
over the past six months to take advantage of the assistance
programs being carried out in the border area by the Agency for
International Development.
   No deliveries were made inside Nicaragua because agreement could
not be reached with the Sandinista government on an acceptable
delivery system.
   The officials said they expect opposition to the proposed
training programs from some members of Congress.
   The prospects for a renewal of military aid for the rebels are
not good. The aid package, initially approved by the Senate in
August, authorized the release of $16.5 million in stockpiled
military equipment under certain conditions.
   But the funds would require congressional approval before
adjournment of the current session, and there is only about a week
left before members go home. The next session of Congress begins in
January.
   There has been no attempt by the administration to trigger a
vote on release of the funds.
   Congress rejected an administration military aid request on Feb.
3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contras
occurred on Feb. 29.
   The majority of the Contras have since resettled along the
border area, faced with the prospect that their principal
benefactor, the United States, can no longer be relied on to aid in
their quest to topple the Sandinista government.
   According to officials, the Contras have some ammunition left
but are no match for the Sandinistas, who received an estimated
$400 million in military equipment from the Soviet Union during the
first eight months of the year.

   Rep. Dennis Eckart says he refused to dye
his hair, but in every other way the Ohio congressman has tried to
transform himself into Dan Quayle as Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen readies for Wednesday night's debate.
   ``I played Abraham Lincoln in 4th grade, so I've played a
Republican before,'' quips Eckart, who is standing in for the GOP
vice presidential nominee in mock debates with Bentsen.
   Actually, Eckart, the former high school and college actor now
in his fourth term in the House, has played a variety of roles,
including a Walter Mondale for Ohio Sen. John Glenn's campaign four
years ago.
   Like Quayle, Eckart is a young, handsome Midwesterner, although
dark-haired and not blond like Quayle. At 38, Eckart is actually
three years younger than the Indiana senator. But at this point, he
feels he knows him well.
   ``He's a cheerleader. He's very enthusiastic about what he
does,'' says the Democrat, who, in the spirit of the Indiana
senator, wore a golf tee tucked over one ear and carried a putter
on the campaign jet Sunday.
   ``I've spent a lot of time on the practice tee at Congressional
(Country Club)'' since getting called to play Quayle about three
weeks ago, he joked.
   Eckart says he has studied Quayle's congressional record and
hours of videotapes of his television performances, including the
1980 debates against Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., whom Quayle defeated
to enter the Senate.
   ``Dan actually took him apart repeatedly,'' he said.
   Eckart says the format for Wednesday's debate in Omaha, Neb. _
with questions from reporters, two-minute answers and one-minute
replies _ favors Quayle. It will be ``a series of one-minute sound
bites. ... And that's where Dan Quayle is absolutely at his best,''
he said.
   ``I think it's a grievous mistake'' to underestimate Quayle's
debating ability, especially on television, he said.
   ``I think Dan is the consummate media-age politician,'' he said.
``I think Wednesday night is playing on Dan Quayle's home court.''
   And this time, ``Dan has got the best handlers in the world,''
he said, referring to Bush media adviser Roger Ailes, who is
overseeing Quayle's preparations.
   Eckart presented Bentsen with an inscribed golf ball _ the words
are a campaign secret _ when he mock debated Bentsen for the first
time Sunday morning in a Washington, D.C., hotel room. He plans
another performance today in Austin, where Bentsen is cramming for
the debate.
   Eckart is separated from Bentsen except when they debate. He
says he doesn't know either Bentsen or Quayle very well, although
he has worked with both of them occasionally in Congress.
   He refuses to disclose the contents of Sunday's session, but he
says his research unearthed some zingers Quayle might use. ``I sent
them (a couple of staffers) scurrying out of the room,'' he bragged.
   Eckart says he enjoys ``getting into the head'' of people he's
playing. Asked what he found inside Quayle's head, he laughed and
said, ``Room to maneuver.'' It was about the only negative thing he
had to say about Quayle's ability.
   In playing the Indiana senator, Eckart says he tried to
duplicate his mannerisms and his point of view. But it is difficult
to predict what attitude Quayle will bring to the debate, since it
won't be what he calls the ``vintage Dan Quayle'' of waving his
arms to stir up the crowds.
   ``That's a wild card,'' he says.

Freedom</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has declined to
confirm or deny reports that President P.W. Botha promised to free
imprisoned black activist Nelson Mandela.
   In a joint communique released after Botha's meeting Saturday
with President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Mobutu said he was
``encouraged by the flexible approach'' taken by Botha regarding
Mandela.
   Mobutu was quoted Sunday in The Washington Post as saying, ``I
obtained from Botha a firm commitment that Mandela will soon be
freed without any conditions, that he will be allowed to return to
his home without any constraints.''
   A French news report also said President Botha told Mobutu he
would release Mandela.
   The report was at first denied by Roland Darroll, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman. Darroll said Mobutu, if quoted properly, was
overstating the gist of the summit discussion.
   However, a statement issued later by Foreign Minister Pik Botha
avoided contradicting Mobutu and left open the possibility
President Botha may indeed have made some type of promise.
   The statement said: ``The only agreed version of the discussion
concerning Mr. Mandela's release is contained in a joint communique
issued at the conclusion of the talks.''
   Mandela, 70, is considered the most popular leader among South
Africa's disenfranchised black majority. He has been jailed since
1962 and is serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to
overthrow the government.
   The Post quoted Mobutu as saying in a telephone interview that
Botha gave his ``solemn promise'' he will not send Mandela back to
prison once he recovers from tuberculosis in a Cape Town nursing
home.
   Botha frequently has said he would release Mandela in exchange
for Mandela's renunciation of violence. Mandela has refused to
repudiate the violent tactics of the outlawed African National
Congress, the main group fighting South Africa's government.

   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former
hostage in Lebanon who is moving to Los Angeles, urged hundreds of
worshipers at a farewell Mass to remember the remaining U.S. and
British captives.
   ``I hope after I leave you will not forget them in your
prayers,'' he said Sunday. ``May we one day meet again in the
kingdom of God, where there is only Jesus and dancing.''
   Jenco co-celebrated the Mass at The Grotto, a Marian shrine
where he has been in residence since February. Jenco was leaving
today to become Roman Catholic chaplain at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles.
   The Servite priest, who was released in Beirut in July 1986
after 19 months of captivity, urged worshipers to maintain a
``childlike capacity to trust'' and to use children as a model for
avoiding prejudice.
   ``Children don't choose friends on the color of their skin,
their clothes or the size of their houses,'' Jenco said. ``It is
those of us who are older who clutter up our lives with prejudice
and hatred.''

   Gold medalist Teresa Weatherspoon of the U.S.
Olympic women's basketball team gave out more than a few autographs
when she passed through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   Weatherspoon gave her basketball and a poster signed by her
fellow teammates to Army Sgt. Paul Patricio, 20, on Friday.
   Patricio, a Seattle native, suffered third-degree burns on 50
percent of his body and lost both hands and a forearm in saving the
lives of seven soldiers after a helicopter crash Feb. 25 near
Chico, Texas. Ten others died in the crash.
   ``I gave it to him because he's such a courageous young man to
save those people's lives and I just admired him for it,''
Weatherspoon, 22, said from her home in Pineland, Texas.
   ``I was shocked,'' Patricio said Saturday. ``She said I deserved
that basketball more than she did and she wanted me to have it.''
   Skycap Eddie Harris, who had helped the soldier off his plane in
a wheelchair, introduced him to Weatherspoon while the guard was

   Actress Carol Burnett says a telephone hotline
session here has taught her that alcoholism makes no distinction
between people of the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``The problems are the same. The feelings are the same. The love
is the same,'' Miss Burnett told reporters Sunday during an
informal meeting sponsored by the Soviet-U.S. Joint Conference on
Alcoholism and Drug Addiction.
   ``The only difference is the language,'' she said.
   Miss Burnett and her daughter, Carrie Hamilton, took phone calls
from Soviet citizens for three hours Saturday. The day marked the
seventh anniversary of Miss Hamilton's decision to stop taking
drugs.
   ``Many people believed it was impossible to achieve sobriety,''
Miss Hamilton said of the callers. ``I'm here as proof they're
wrong.''
   Soviet officials said that while Miss Burnett, the daughter of
two alcoholics, is not well known in their country, they value her
knowledge and experience in struggling against alcoholism.

   The late Mafia boss Sam Giancana was frying
sausages and peppers when an unknown visitor shot him to death, and
his daughter Antoinette Giancana is making sure his culinary
interests survive his violent demise.
   Ms. Giancana, who let people in on the bedroom activities of
mobsters in her 1984 book ``Mafia Princess,'' says she now plans to
publish the ``Mafia Cookbook.''
   The book, she says, will feature the favorite recipes, wines and
culinary secrets of 35 of Chicago's most notorious gangsters and
will go beyond Italian cuisine.
   ``Just like my father, these men didn't enjoy just Italian
food,'' said Ms. Giancana, 53. ``They wanted the creme de la creme
wherever they went and they got it _ steak divine, crab imperial.''
   Her father, one of the nation's most powerful mobsters, was shot
seven times in the head and killed in his suburban Oak Park home in
1975.
   One source for the book will be Mike Fish, 85, who said he often
ate at the Chicago home of gangster Al Capone's mother.
   ``She was a wonderful cook,'' Fish said. ``Al was a heavy eater
who liked rare steaks. His mother would prepare a dozen types of
pasta, but Capone preferred spaghetti and meat sauce, heavy on the
cheese.''

<HEAD>Reagan Lauds Congress for Getting Down to Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan doesn't like everything he
sees in the new spending measures for 1989, but he says Congress
still deserves a pat on the back for getting its work done on time
this year.
   Reagan, who signed the last of 13 major spending bills on
Saturday _ the first day of fiscal 1989 _ said ``For the first time
in years, all the government's budgetary work is done.''
   ``The last of the government's 13 appropriations bill have been
delivered to me and I have signed them,'' he said in his weekly
radio address, just hours after Congress approved the money to keep
federal agencies operating.
   The usually rancorous budget process was eased this year because
Congress and the White House had cut deals that virtually
guaranteed approval of the spending bills even before Reagan
introduced his budget.
   It was the first time since 1976 that the House and Senate, both
controlled by Democrats, had passed the bills separately and on
time.
   ``Congress deserves a pat on the back for completing all 13
separate appropriations bills for a fiscal year,'' Reagan said.
``They worked long and hard to meet this year's deadline.'
   But Reagan criticized as minimal the amount of humanitarian aid
Congress granted the Contra rebels of Nicaragua, and chided
lawmakers for approving a ``protectionist'' textile bill that he
vetoed earlier in the week.
   Had Reagan signed all the bills before 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday
as he had hoped, it would have been the first time since 1948 that
all appropriations bills were enacted before the start of the new
fiscal year.
   Last year Reagan signed a $600 billion catchall spending bill,
but he threatened to exercise his veto if a similar measure was put
on his desk this year.
   Reagan signed six appropriations bills Saturday, including a
$282 billion defense spending bill and a $14.3 billion foreign aid
measure. The other bills were signed earlier.
   The usual ferocity over spending priorities was tempered by the
desire of the administration and congressional Democrats to avoid a
repeat of last year's embarrassing budget finale.
   But it remained to be seen if the spending measures would fall
in line with strictures of the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law,
which requires a deficit of $146 billion for fiscal 1989.
   If the deficit should surpass $146 billion when it is measured
on Oct. 15, spending would have to be cut across-the-board by at
least $10 billion, an amount that would cause political pain for
lawmakers in an election year.

   Firefighters nearly surrounded a
10,665-acre wildfire Sunday that burned one home in a four-day
rampage through the San Bernardino mountains and put out a small
blaze in the Angeles National Forest.
   ``All they're doing right now is mopping up,'' Ken Schmidt, a
California Department of Forestry fire dispatcher, said of the San
Bernadino blaze.
   The fire, dubbed the Texas blaze, was set by an arsonist
Wednesday on Texas Hill. Fanned by strong, dry Santa Ana winds, it
closed nearby Interstate 15 at times, and forced hundreds of
residents to flee their homes.
   One luxury ranch home burned, and six people were injured.
   The fire was 80 percent contained Sunday afternoon with full
containment expected by Monday evening. Full control was expected
by Thursday, said Forestry Department dispatcher Andrew Avila. The
force of 950 firefighters was being reduced.
   In the Angeles National Forest, three air tankers were sent up
to help about 200 U.S. Forest Service firefighters fight a fire two
miles south of the Little Rock Reservoir, said forest service
dispatcher John Grabowski.
   The fire, which started about 3 p.m., burned five acres in
steep, inaccessible terrain, 35 miles northeast of downtown Los
Angeles, he said. There were no reports of injuries and the blaze
was doused in about 30 minutes.
   Another arson fire in Millcreek near Yucaipa charred 135 acres
of heavy brush north of Highway 38, about 75 miles east of downtown
Los Angeles, authorities said. It was under control Sunday, but
three firefighters were injured in the process.

   Republican Dan Quayle believes the vice presidential debate will
enable the GOP contender to dispel doubts harbored by some voters
about his candidacy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, still uncomfortable
with the format, is relying on mock debates and intense preparation
to ready for the encounter.
   The tickets' top candidates _ Republican George Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis _ took a day off from campaigning Sunday
while their running mates crammed for Wednesday night's matchup in
Omaha, Neb.
   Quayle, in a pre-debate interview with The Associated Press,
said that although the vice presidential encounter is important,
the determining factor for American voters is the candidate for the
White House _ and the Indiana senator will direct his attacks at
the Democratic nominee.
   ``The opponent for me is Michael Dukakis. He's the one that's
running for president,'' Quayle said. ``The senator from Texas is
the vice presidential nominee, and my target and my discussion and
my focus that evening will be on the governor from Massachusetts.''
   Dukakis, who spent Sunday in Boston, was traveling to an
elementary school in Hartford, Conn., today before attending a
rally on the statehouse steps. The Democratic nominee also was
visiting DearbornHeights, Mich., to watch the incineration of
confiscated drugs at a local sanitation plant.
   Bush was greeting the return of the space shuttle Discovery and
its five-man crew at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The vice
president was planning a campaign stop later in the day in Redding,
a growing Northern California city.
   Meanwhile, a statewide poll in heavily-Democratic Maryland found
the two candidates in a virtual dead heat with Bush leading Dukakis
48-44 percent. The survey of 889 registered voters, conducted for
The Baltimore Sun Monday through Thursday, had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.
   The vice presidential candidates cleared their campaign
schedules to concentrate on the debate, while workers at the Civic
Auditorium in Omaha readied the hall after a performance by a
Christian rock band and an Terry Forsberg, is decorating the
candidates' dressing rooms with carpeting and drapes.
   ``They'll look like your living room _ or better yet, theirs,''
Forsberg said.
   Quayle holed up with top advisers at an undisclosed location in
the Washington, D.C., area, and conducted mock debates with
Bentsen's stand-in, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   The Indiana senator said he was not concerned about possible
gaffes during the debate, a problem for the candidate during his
campaign appearances.
   ``The reason I'm not is because it's going to be questions and
answers. There's always that possibility, but I'm a very confident
person,'' he said.
   Republican strategists believe expectations remain low for
Quayle's performance based on his miscues and reputation as a
lightweight candidate. But the Indiana senator says he is not
giving much consideration to expectations.
   ``The American people will be able to see me in an unedited
version for the first time since New Orleans, and it's going to be
a great opportunity for me,'' he said.
   Bentsen, meanwhile, held a mock debate with Quayle stand-in,
Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, and then flew to Austin, Texas, to
devote his time to debate preparation.
   In the mock session, Eckart's attacks sent staffers scurrying
for research material, and left Bentsen a bit uncomfortable with
the debate format _ 90 minutes of questions, two-minute responses
and one-minute rebuttals.
   ``He does not seem relaxed,'' said Bentsen's spokesman Mike
McCurry. ``If it were the Senate floor he'd be very comfortable and
if it were the Senate rules he would be very comfortable.''
   Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, also downplayed
expectations for the Texas senator, an odds-on favorite based on
his experience.
   ``I have a lot of confidence in Senator Bentsen. But Dan Quayle
is a very effective debater,'' she said.

   Officials are continuing to track the orbit of
a nuclear reactor which once powered a Soviet spy satellite, but
say there no longer is a danger of radioactive debris falling to
Earth.
   The reactor earlier had been ejected from the satellite, Kosmos
1900, and sent into a higher orbit where it does not pose a threat
to earth, officials said.
   Maj. Alex Mondragon, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command's
Space Surveillance Center in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., said Sunday
that the rest of the Soviet satellite has disintegrated and poses
no danger.
   Two pieces fell to Earth along the eastern coast of Africa on
Saturday, he said.
   ``There's no danger ... I think it's over,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Mondragon said the nuclear reactor is still being tracked in its
higher orbit. ``It should stay up there for a number of years,'' he
said.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Saturday lifted a
nationwide alert which had been imposed earlier when there was
concern some radioactive debris might fall to earth.

<HEAD>Du Pont Defends Role in Operating Weapons Reactors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co., facing criticism for its
operation of nuclear weapons reactors at the Savannah River Plant,
insists its commitment to safety at the South Carolina facility is
``unyielding.''
   ``We were appalled and dismayed to read news accounts which
assert that we have in any way posed a nuclear safety threat to our
employees or the public,'' the company said in a statement on
Sunday.
   ``Our record of performance in radiation control and nuclear
safety clearly indicates the opposite,'' it said. ``In fact, we
have never had an employee experience a single day of lost work
from any nuclear incident.''
   The safety of the Department of Energy reactors came under heavy
criticism at a congressional hearing Friday.
   A 1985 memorandum disclosed at the hearing listed 30 incidents
at the five Savannah River reactors between 1957 and 1985. They
included one in which fuel rods melted and another in which a chain
reaction nearly went out of control.
   ``There are currently some senior managers within the department
with an attitude toward production reactor safety which on the face
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program
prior to the (shuttle) Challenger accident,'' said another memo
released at the hearing.
   That memo was written Sept. 16 by Richard Starostecki, a deputy
assistant energy secretary.
   In a statement provided by Clif Webb, a Du Pont spokesman at the
Savannah River Plant, the company said all 30 incidents cited in
the 1985 memo ``were in the formal reactor incident reporting
system.''
   Also, it said the report was reviewed with Du Pont's reactor
safety advisory committee in May 1985 and with the National Academy
of Sciences in October 1986.
   Refuting allegations that it had withheld or covered up
information, Du Pont said it has provided daily and monthly
operations reports to DOE; maintained a formal reactor incident
reporting system since 1957; provided semiannual summary reports of
reactor incidents to Du Pont and DOE management for the past 20
years; and shared reactor incident report information with the news
media.
   ``Our commitment to the safe operation of the Savannah River
Plant, the safety of our employees and the protection of public
health and safety is unyielding,'' the company said.

   Thousands of members of an Estonian
nationalist group demanded greater autonomy for their republic and
charged the Kremlin with sapping Estonia's agricultural resources,
causing suffering and food shortages.
   Soviet authorities ``are to blame for our suffering here, the
lack of food here,'' delegate Albert Danielson told more than 3,000
members of the fledgling People's Front Sunday at the group's first
congress in Tallinn, the picturesque capital of this republic on
the Baltic Sea.
   Some speakers objected to what they called the Moscow's
``colonialist'' policy in which the government siphons off
Estonia's agricultural output and manufactured goods.
   ``We have been reduced to the level of slaves in a manor,''
farmer Enno Peets told the cheering delegates.
   The blue, black and white flag of the independent Estonian
republic that existed between the two world wars was brought to the
Town Hall stage during closing ceremonies Sunday that featured
singing of the nationalist song ``Fatherland.''
   The two-day conference opened Saturday with an address by
Estonia's Communist Party chief, Vajno Vyalyas, who greeted the
group in the name of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Official sanction for the meeting was an indication of the
changing attitudes of authorities, who until recently would have
jailed those espousing nationalist sentiments.
   The issue of ethnic relations is an important one for Gorbachev,
who is beset by unrest among the Soviet Union's more than 100
ethnic groups.
   Unrest has been particularly troublesome here and in two other
Baltic republics, Lithuania and Latvia, as well as in the southern
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The Soviet Union took over the Baltic republics under a 1939
agreement with Nazi Germany.
   The People's Front, formed in April, says it does not challenge
the authority of the Communist Party and is not interested in
breaking away from the Soviet Union. But some members say privately
that their ultimate goal is independence.
   The group claims membership of 60,000 of Estonia's 1.5 million
people.
   Vyalyas told a news conference that the republic's reforms ``are
always favorably accepted'' by Gorbachev, but that some proposals
go too far.
   ``Our wills and wishes have certain limits ... when fantasy goes
too far from reality we must stop these things,'' he told reporters.
   A clear sign of recent liberalization was the presence at the
congress of an Estonian nationalist who has spent much of his life
in labor camps for his views.
   Mart Niklus, released in July after serving eight years in his
most recent term, could be immediately spotted in a sea of business
suits by his dark gray and black striped camp uniform. The
54-year-old Niklus said some ideas expressed at the congress were
similar to those that sent him to the camps.
   The delegates passed nearly two dozen resolutions Sunday,
including one demanding that the 1939 agreement in which Estonia
became part of the Soviet Union be renounced.
   Another resolution urged the Estonian government and the
Communist Party to stop the flow of people of other nationalities
into the republic, where ethnic Estonians make up 60 percent of the
population.
   The resolutions have no legal force, but the Communist Party and
government already have endorsed many of the group's demands.
   In a speech Saturday, Vyalyas strongly backed demands to wrest
control from government ministries in Moscow over the republic's
economic and cultural affairs.
   Peets, in remarks that brought delegates to their feet, said he
had been a collective farmer for 34 years and was incensed that
Soviet leaders, including Gorbachev, propose renting state land to
farmers to spur productivity.
   He said his ancestors bought land when Estonia was independent
and that it was the state that should have been paying him rent.
   Without naming the People's Front specifically, Gorbachev and
the Kremlin leadership have expressed support for populist
movements and endorsed Estonian-proposed reforms for putting the
republic's economy in the hands of local managers and preserving
the native culture and language.

   Bumper stickers that evoke snickers
with double-entendres can lead to jail in Florida.
   Police are now the official arbiters of what's naughty and nice
under a new state law imposing fines and jail terms for motorists
sporting bumper stickers authorities consider obscene.
   Offenders face a second-degree misdemeanor arrest, six months in
jail and fines of up to $500.
   And that's just for the first offense. Maximum fines and jail
times could double the second time.
   The law passed by state legislators this year went into effect
Saturday.
   Under the statute, a bumper sticker can be obscene if it appeals
to lewd sexual interest, if it depicts sexual conduct in an
obviously offensive way or if it lacks serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.
   ``It's one of the most unconstitutional laws ever passed,''
American Civil Liberties Union member Jim Green said. ``It's a
total joke.''
   Highway Patrol attorneys will issue interpretations of the law
before troopers enforce it, said Broward County State Attorney's
Office spokesman Jack Freese.
   ``I think most people want this law,'' Highway Patrol spokesman
Max Shell said. ``The average person does not want to see
four-letter words and stickers that allude to sex when they're
driving on the highway.''

   The 33-year-old Naperville man just missed representing the
United States on the three-man national team in the World
Hairdressing Championships in Dusseldorf, West Germany, but planned
to enter the contest in the open competition today.
   Rizzo spent $2,000 to go to Europe and train with the U.S. team,
which he failed to make by finishing fourth. He feels the contest
will be good training for the 1990 championships in Tokyo.
   Contests for hairdressers involve speed and technique. Depending
on the category, competitors have 15 to 50 minutes to finish their
work on the heads of models, and they try to sculpt unusual waves
and shapings.
   Rizzo, who owns a salon, is a consultant to a hair styling
products manufacturer and gets $700 per appearance.
   But the world champion can make $1,500 per appearance, he said,
and others in the field say a gold medal could mean much more in
endorsements and appearances.
   His wife, Sue, 31, is looking forward to his winning top honors
in Tokyo and then retiring, Rizzo said.
   ``She wants me to go and get it done with,'' he said. ``She
says, `You've been in competition long enough. It's about time you
go out to stud.'''

   A bipartisan group of legislators says the
next president should increase spending for non-nuclear weapons and
meet military budgets by cancelling new weapons instead of cutting
training.
   ``We seem to believe that our `big guns' _ our strategic nuclear
missiles, our proposed space weapons _ will somehow save us from

   The report was released by the Congressional Military Reform
Caucus, a seven-year-old bipartisan group of senators and House
members who have pushed for improvements in U.S. defenses. Reps.
Charles Bennett, D-Fla., and Tom Ridge, R-Pa., are chairmen of the
group.
   The study called for shifting money from long-range nuclear
weapons and Star Wars anti-missile research into conventional
forces, such as armor and tanks. No figures or force levels were
recommended.

   Authorities today stepped up rescue
operations in four flood-covered states in northern India, where
news reports say as many as 800 people have died.
   In Pakistan, government officials said Sunday that more than 1
million people had been left homeless by flooding in the eastern
part of the country. The official death toll was at 31 but
unofficial reports have said many more died.
   In India's Punjab state, governor S.S. Ray said the three major
rivers in the region had receded below danger level, allowing
workers to step up relief efforts.
   However, he said about 200,000 people were still marooned in
1,650 villages and at least 142 people were reported missing.
   Relief workers used boats to try to rescue trapped villagers,
officials said. Helicopters dropped packages of food and other
supplies into the flooded areas, and Indian air force transport
planes carried gasoline, diesel and kerosene into areas where road
and rail service had been cut off.
   Officials also were trying to determine the extent of crop
damage in Punjab, which produces more than half of the country's
wheat and rice.
   The official death toll from the flash floods, which struck
Punjab and the neighboring state of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and
Jammu-Kashmir beginning Sept. 22, stood at 414. But news reports,
most unattributed, put the tally as high as 800.
   Floods frequently batter the subcontinent when the summer
monsoons begin in late June. In August, more than 1,000 people died
in neighboring Bangladesh in that country's worst flooding.
Hundreds of thousands were left homeless.
   The Associated Press of Pakistan reported Sunday that nearly
2,000 villages there were hit by flooding from heavy rains in
mid-September and more than 850,000 acres of land were still under
water.
   Lahore, the ancient Punjab capital of 6 million people, remained
cut off from most of western and northern Pakistan. Parts of the
highway linking Lahore to Islamabad, the nation's capital, had been
under water for several days.
   Army soldiers have been flying over the hardest hit areas and
dropping sealed food bags to people still clinging to their roofs
to escape the water. Food along with medical supplies were also
ferried to stranded residents by motor boat.
   Officials said at least 1 million residents were forced to leave
their homes.
   The threat from the Ravi and Chenab rivers in Pakistan's eastern
Punjab province has passed but the Sutlej River flowing west from
India continues to be a problem, officials said. They said the
Sutlej, only a trickle since India built a dam 30 years ago, has
risen dramatially.
   Leaders of the flood stricken countries have called for
cooperation in fighting the floods.
   Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Nepal's King
Birendra's agreed to ``mitigate the incidence of floods in the
future,'' according to a joint statement released in Katmandu.
   Ershad visited Nepal on Sunday. The two agreed to support the
idea that any solution to the problems of managing natural
disasters requires regional cooperation involving all countries in
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
   The group includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
   Ershad also visited India Thursday for talks with Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi as part of his campaign for international support to
control flooding.

<HEAD>More Than 1,000 Prisoners Released Under Amnesty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 prisoners, including
52 political offenders, were released today under a special amnesty
marking South Korea's National Foundation Day, a major national
holiday.
   The amnesty, however, was criticized by opposition parties, who
have been demanding the release of ``all political prisoners.''
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said his party, along with other
opposition parties, would try to enact a special law to win the
release of other ``prisoners of conscience.''
   Kim, president of the main opposition group, the Party for Peace
and Democracy, gave no overall figures but said ``only one-tenth of
the prisoners of conscience'' were freed.
   Those freed today included Lee Tae-bok, a 38-year-old publisher
whose release was demanded by delegates attending the World
Congress of PEN here in early September. PEN is a London-based
world organization of literary figures.
   Lee was arrested in 1981 on charges of plotting to organize a
leftist underground movement and formenting a communist rebellion
through a publishing company he owned, PEN said.
   He was sentenced to life, which was later commuted to 20 years
in 1983.
   PEN sought the release of three other writers also in jail for
political reasons, but they were excluded in the amnesty.
   Government officials said the other writers, mentioned by PEN,
were directly involved in arson that resulted in deaths or
anti-South Korea activities in favor of communist North Korea.

<HEAD>Bush Widening Lead Over Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, benefiting from general
satisfaction with the state of the country, leads Democrat Michael
Dukakis 48-41 percent in the race for the presidency, according to
a new Time magazine opinion poll.
   Bush's margin was one percentage wider than the lead he held in
a similar Time national survey in August and it was a few
percentage points more than other national polls have given the GOP
nominee in recent weeks.
   The vice president is leading partly because most of those
surveyed are pleased with the state of the country, according to
Time. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said things are going
``fairly well or very well,'' the highest proportion since October
1984.
   However, a majority of those polled believe that blacks, the
young, the elderly, low-income families and the middle class are
worse off under Ronald Reagan.
   And 51 percent of those polled said Bush is ``avoiding the real
issues of the campaign.'' Only 41 percent said the same of Dukakis.
   Forty-seven percent of the respondents believe the choice of Dan
Quayle as a running mate reflects unfavorably on Bush's ability to
make important presidential decisions.
   Asked about the recent debate, voters found Dukakis ``more
believable'' by 40 percent to 39 percent, and also gave Dukakis
credit for having a better command of the facts, by 44 percent to
35 percent.
   The poll, conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, surveyed
1,101 likely voters by telephone Sept. 27-28. The sampling error
was estimated at plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Thousands Heed Government Order to Return to Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of civil servants and factory
workers heeded stern official warnings and returned to work today
as the military government appeared to have broken Burma's first
general strike in 26 years.
   Attendance figures were not available but some government
officials said about 80 percent of the workers were expected to be
back at their jobs rather than face dismissal or other punishment.
   ``Anyone who prevents, obstructs or interferes with workers
returning to work on Oct. 3 will be dealt with sternly,'' the
government warned in press and radio announcements Sunday. The
government had earlier warned that workers who did not report back
today could be fired.
   Opposition parties have urged strikers to stay away from their
jobs, hoping to pressure the current government, which was formed
following a Sept. 18 military coup lead by hardliner Gen. Saw Maung.
   Western diplomats say a general strike, which began Aug. 8,
appears to be the last effective weapon of pro-democracy forces in
Burma which since late July have tried to topple an entrenched
authoritarian system.
   ``We have to go back. We need money, our salaries, and the
special rations of rice and oil,'' one returning government clerk
said.
   Some government employes returned to work last week and drew
their September salaries on Sept. 30. They were also given special
rations of rice and edible oil _ both in short supply in Rangoon as
a result of the political upheaval and strike.
   The strike was the first mass labor agitation since strongman Ne
Win seized power in 1962 and instituted a military-backed,
one-party system which advocated socialism. Trade unions were
hastily formed after the Aug. 8 strike but without funds to support
striking workers or real organizational experience.
   Still, it appeared unlikely that the government machinery and
state-owned factories would regain momentum in the near future.
   Some civil servants were seen loitering near shops after signing
attendance registers in their offices. Asked why they were in the
streets instead of at their desks, one said: ``There is no work in
the office at the moment.''
   Virtually all of the country's more than 1,000 factories had
ceased operations because of the strike and are faced with lack of
spare parts and raw materials. A large number have been ransacked
by looters who have taken away or destroyed machinery and materials.
   A recent television report showed cigarette factories and a soap
factory in northern Rangoon totally destroyed. Looters of many
enterprises even stripped off tin roofs, which are selling at
inflated prices on the black market.
   Banks reopened but only to handle salaries and pensions of
government employes. Servicing of private accounts has not begun.
   Already in crisis when the anti-government movement began,
experts say Burma's economy is shattered.
   Burma's major aid donor, Japan, has stopped sending assistance
in recent weeks while West Germany and the United States have
frozen all but humanitarian aid in reaction to the ruthless
suppression of dissent by the authorities.
   By official count, about 425 persons have been killed since the
Sept. 18 coup. Western diplomats and opposition figures say
casualties were far higher, while several thousand are reliably
believe to have died as the military put down earlier
demonstrations.
   The government has promised general elections and allowed
political parties to register, thus formally breaking the monopoly
on power held by the Burma Socialist Program Party since 1962.
   However, this party, now renamed the National Unity Party, is
solidly entrenched and has a nation-wide organizational network.
The strongest of the opposition groups, the National League for
Democracy, does not even have a central office and virtually no
funds.
   The league has not yet announced whether it would contest the
elections.
   Ne Win resigned in July and was replaced by Sein Lwin, a
hard-line military man. He too resigned after massive
anti-government protests and was replaced by Maung Maung, a
civilian. Saw Maung ousted Maung Maung.

<HEAD>New KGB Chief Kryuchkov Is Secret Police Veteran</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Kremlin Shake-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's newly appointed KGB chief is a
veteran of the secret police force, but unlike his predecessors he
was not given a seat on the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
   Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, 64, was named KGB chief Saturday by the
Supreme Soviet shortly after the nation's parliament elected
Mikhail S. Gorbachev president.
   Kryuchkov replaced Viktor M. Chebrikov, a full Politburo member
since 1985 and KGB chief since 1982. Chebrikov remained on the
12-man Politburo, but he was shifted to responsibility for legal
affairs in a newly streamlined apparatus of the party's
policy-making Central Committee.
   The 300-member Central Committee also added Alexander V. Vlasov,
who as interior minister is in charge of uniformed police, to the
non-voting Politburo members. That move could enhance the status of
the uniformed police over the KGB in Gorbachev's new power
structure.
   Few details are known about Kryuchkov, who became deputy
chairman of the KGB in November 1978.
   In a four-paragraph biographical sketch, the official news
agency Tass said Kryuchkov, who holds the rank of an army general,
held senior posts on the security force for more than 20 years.
   Tass said he trained as a lawyer and worked several years as a
prosecutor. He also served on the Central Committee staff from 1959
to 1967.

<HEAD>Shuttle Landing _ You Only Get One Try</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike an airplane that
can circle an airport for hours, when the shuttle glides to Earth
without power, it gets only one chance to land.
   ``There's no opportunity to go around. You've got to hit it the
first time,'' said Bob Evans, chief of the Air Force research
projects office at this Mojave Desert military base, 80 miles
northeast of Los Angeles where Discovery was to end its four-day
mission at 9:37 a.m. PDT today.
   The task of landing begins half a world away from Edwards Air
Force Base, and re-entry could result in the orbiter burning up in
the atmosphere if it is done incorrectly.
   Here is how NASA says a textbook landing would progress:
   After the astronauts have put on their new emergency escape
suits, the pilot positions the shuttle upside-down and tail-first.
He then fires small rockets in what is called the ``deorbit burn''
an hour before landing. Flight computers fire other thrusters to
flip the shuttle forward again for re-entry.
   The computer guidance system helps keep the shuttle at the
proper angle for re-entry, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration also has modified Discovery's heat-shielding tiles
and blankets to improve the craft's ability to withstand heat.
   Once the shuttle descends to 75 miles above Earth's surface, it
enters the atmosphere at about 25 times the speed of sound. It is
then about 5,000 miles west of Edwards Air Force Base.
   The pilot monitors computer controls to perform ``energy
management,'' which means making S-turns and other maneuvers to
reduce the shuttle's speed as it approaches the landing site, said
Milt Thompson, chief engineer for NASA's Dryden Flight Research
Facility here.
   ``If he doesn't control his energy accurately enough he may
overshoot Edwards and not have a place to land or undershoot and
land in the water,'' Thompson said.
   Heat from re-entry ionizes atoms of air around the shuttle when
it is about 50 miles above the Earth and about 25 minutes before
landing. That has the effect of blacking out ground-to-shuttle
communications for about 13 minutes until the orbiter is 30 miles
above the planet and heading toward the California coast.
   Once it descends to about 10 miles altitude, thrusters no longer
can move the orbiter, so control depends on flaps, rudders and
speed brakes, which are run by a hydraulic system powered by three
auxiliary power units, or APUs.
   According to a study by an engineering consulting firm
commissioned by NASA and McDonnell Douglas Corp., there is a
one-in-70 chance that all three APUs will fail during landing and
cause the shuttle to crash. NASA contends the risk is far lower.
   At an altitude of about 22 miles, or 115,400 feet, the shuttle
crosses California's coastline near Santa Barbara at a speed 4.37
times the speed of sound.
   From that point until the orbiter slows below the speed of sound
minutes before landing, anyone under the flight path will hear two
loud sonic booms as the shuttle's nose and wings zip through the
air.
   Approaching from the west, the shuttle flies east over Edwards
and circles north, west and then south as it continues to slow and
glides toward its unpaved runway on Rogers Dry Lake.
   It angles downward at about 21 degrees, seven times steeper than
the path of a commercial jet, before leveling out 17 seconds before
landing.
   ``It comes down like a streamlined brick,'' Thompson said.
   The commander usually starts to control the shuttle manually at
this point, pulling the nose up to reduce speed. The pilot opens
doors to deploy the landing gear 14 seconds before touchdown.
   Normal touchdown occurs at a speed between 210 and 225 mph, and
the shuttle rolls to a halt in about 8,000 feet.
   Discovery's commander, Frederick H. Hauck, was asked during a
news conference from space Sunday to describe the final moments of
landing:
   ``We'll be coming in just about between Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara, overhead the coast at about 110,000 feet and circling
around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds permit to
land on Edwards Runway 17.
   ``We'll pass overhead the field at about 40,000 feet, becoming
subsonic. You all can hear as we're supersonic a double sonic boom.
When you hear that, you'll know we're about five minutes from
landing. And then we'll make a standard approach, 300 miles per
hour, coming down to a touchdown at 200 miles per hour on that
lakebed.''
   NASA has modified Discovery's braking and steering systems in
hope of avoiding the brake and tire damage that occurred during
earlier landings.
   The crew once steered shuttles down the runway by applying
differential pressure to brakes, but that caused brake overheating
and damage. Now a backup nosewheel steering system has been
installed so the shuttle could be steered straight in crosswinds or
if tires blew out.
   NASA also installed a thicker main landing gear axle, put holes
in brake pistons to prevent pressure surges, modified controls to
equalize pressure on adjacent brakes and installed thicker brake
discs.
   At the urging of astronauts and the Rogers Commission, which
investigated the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger launch disaster, shuttles
will land here for the foreseeable future, frustrating NASA's
initial plans to save time and money by landing the spacecraft
regularly back at the Cape Canaveral, Fla., launch site.
   The 44-square-mile dry lakebed at Edwards leaves plenty of room
for safety if brakes fail or tires blow out.
   Eighteen previous flights landed here, five at Cape Canaveral,
and one at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a key opposition victory, the
Supreme Court paved the way for open elections later this year by
ruling that political party may field candidates.
   The decision Sunday by the nation's highest court overturned a
decree by the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq that candidates
must run as individuals unaffiliated with political parties.
   The ruling was a victory for opposition leader Benazir Bhutto,
who had claimed Zia's decree was unconstitutional and would
unfairly favor governing party candidates.
   ``Pakistan today has a real chance of moving towards national
unity,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a telephone interview from her
residence in the southern port of Karachi, where she is resting
following the birth of her first child Sept. 21.
   ``Representative government will be set up ... which would work
for the peace and stability of the country,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   With candidates allowed to run on a party basis, Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party is expected to do well in November
elections against Zia loyalists, who are split into two factions of
the center-right Pakistan Muslim League.
   The ruling could also help Pakistan return to democratic rule
after 11 years under Zia, a military general who imposed eight
years of martial law during his time in office.
   Zia _ who ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years
later _ was killed in a plane crash Aug. 17. The cause of the crash
is under investigation.
   In May, Zia dismissed the 3-year-old civilian government of
Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and dissolved parliament,
saying it was corrupt and incompetent. He named a caretaker
government and scheduled elections Nov. 16.
   Zia's successor, former Senate Chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan,
promised to continue the late president's policies until the
November election but asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the
vote should be held on a party basis.
   After the ruling was announced, caretaker Justice Minister Wasim
Sajjad announced a list of reforms to the country's election laws
to combat cheating and streamline the electoral process.
   Among other things, Sajjad said, the Cabinet:
   _gave the federal election commission the power to suspend any
officer immediately on suspicion of impropriety.
   _eased requirements for a candidate's registration.
   _required the use of national identity cards to prevent multiple
voting.
   _raised the maximum campaign spending limits.
   Pakistanis still are awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on
the constitutionality of Zia's dismissal of the civilian government.
   A federal high court on Sept. 27 ruled that Zia's action was
unconstitutional, thus implying that the caretaker government was
illegitimate.
   Ishaq Khan appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in order
to assure that the caretaker government remain in office until the
elections. The justices are expected to rule on that case early
this week.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Again Devalues Currency, Raises Gas Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of Nicaragua's currency has
dropped 77 percent and the price of gasoline has doubled in this
year's fourth round of economic measures designed to shore up a
battered economy.
   The official exchange rate for the national currency, the
cordoba, went from 180 to the dollar to 320 to the dollar over the
weekend. The government-controlled exchange rate, available for
only a handful of transactions such as those involving medical
supplies, allows 485 cordobas to the dollar.
   Gasoline rose from the equivalent of $1.02 a gallon to $2.03 a
gallon. A month ago, it sold for the equivalent of 46 cents a
gallon.
   State workers will get an immediate 35 percent raise, the
government said.
   The leftist government blames the 8-year-old war with U.S.
backed rebels, known as Contras, for economic woes that include
rampant inflation, shortages of food and fuel and a shrinking
economy.
   President Daniel Ortega described similar economic steps taken a
month ago as a matter of ``survival'' until Nicaragua is at peace.
   Planning Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said the most recent
devaluation is designed to ``establish a realistic relationship
between prices in the domestic and international markets,''
according to the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista party,
Barricada.
   The Sandinista government began making economic adjustments in
February, when inflation was said officially to be at 1,300
percent. A series of devaluations and gasoline price hikes have
followed.
   Many wage and price controls were lifted in June.

   Gosh it's been a long and contentious campaign
year here in the United States of America. Consider instead the way
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev runs for president: Quietly,
spending little money, insulting none of his opponents, oblivious
to the polls, gracious in victory.
   Our political parties should pay attention to the card-carrying
communists over in Moscow.
   Take last Friday, for example.
   That was the day when, practically out of nowhere, the Central
Committee met to consider personnel shifts at the top level of the
Communist Party. The meeting was important because the party has
held power in Moscow since 1917 and so Central Committee decisions
tend to have wide influence over government.
   Prevailing in the Central Committee is like winning a Democratic
primary for Congress in West Virginia.
   And what were Michael Dukakis and George Bush up to on Friday?
   The Democrat began his day with a farm rally in Idalou, Texas,
en route to the famous Stringfellow toxic waste site near
Riverside, Calif., and a town meeting at Rubidoux High School. Then
on to San Francisco for a dinner honoring party fund-raiser Walter
Shorenstein.
   Bush, a card-carrying Republican, enjoyed a similarly exciting
day. The schedule called for a morning student assembly at
Ridgefield Memorial High in New Jersey, then a meeting with
Archbishop Whealon of Hartford, Conn., before a rally at St.
Joseph's College.
   Of course these presidential candidates can't be everywhere at
once, so they send their running mates out, too. Lloyd Bentsen
began his day at the First Union Plaza in Charlotte, N.C. Dan
Quayle was at the Great American Firehouse Exposition and Muster in
Philadelphia.
   During Friday's Central Committee meeting, Andrei Gromyko gave
up his party positions and sources expected that just 24 hours
later, at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet, he would quit as
president, too.
   Imagine the campaign that must have taken place in those 24
hours as word rifled through the 10 time zones and 130 languages of
the Soviet Union that Gromyko had chosen to vacate the presidency.
His retirement created an immediate opening. It was like Ferdinand
Marcos calling a snap election.
   Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist Party, was an
odds on favorite to win the job, rather like Ronald Reagan running
for re-election in 1984.
   He had three things going for him in the whirlwind campaign for
the presidency (aside from the magnificent personality that leads
American observers to speculate that he'd be a great pol in a
democracy as well as in a police state).
   Thing One: He knew this snap election was imminent _ the ruling
Politburo having already decided to make some reforms and some
personnel changes. So he had time to prepare a platform and put
together a majority coalition.
   Thing Two: Gorbachev had recently been out on the stump, in
Siberia. Siberian citizens freely expressed dismay over economic
hardships, pleas that may have energized Gorbachev and sparked his
effort to push quickly for the next stage of reform.
   Thing Three: His principal rival, conservative Yegor Ligachev,
had been on vacation most of the preceding month. Anyone who
follows politics knows that it is stupid to go on vacation just as
a campaign is heating up. Former Vice President Walter Mondale went
fishing after the Democratic National Convention in 1984 and lost
49 states, including every state he failed to go fishing in.
   Gorbachev won his presidency before opponents could even
schedule advertising time in the major media markets.
   He was nominated Saturday and when the presiding officer of the
Supreme Soviet asked, ``And who is against?'' not one of the 1,500
legislators raised a hand. The winner nodded, smiling. With his
victory, and a dozen other key personnel moves, Gorbachev had won a
change that ultimately could set the stage for a crucial transfer
of power from the Communist Party to the Soviet government.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis and Bush are intensifying their struggle for
American popular support. They are visiting tens of tarmacs and
dozens of day care centers. They will debate again. They will
exchange police endorsements, poke at one anothers'
vulnerabilities. Slowly, grudgingly, they provide a glimpse of how
they want to handle such issues as deficits, AIDS, Star Wars, the
Contras _ even relations with the Kremlin. In response to the
popular will, they may shift a position: Dukakis more sympathetic
to the Pentagon, Bush more understanding of abortion and less
tolerant of pollution or administration malfeasance.
   They'll kiss a million babies, shake a billion hands, spend a
zillion dollars and then after two years of this, one of them gets
to be president, just like Gorbachev. Ligachev? In his absence,
they put him in charge of agriculture.

<TEXT>
   In a corrugated metal complex that
reverberates with echoes of aerospace history, a team of 1,000
workers is building a replacement for the ill-fated space shuttle
Challenger.
   The new orbiter vehicle is as yet unnamed. It is a collection of
titanium forgings, machined parts and electronic boxes known at
this stage of production only as OV-105.
   Its letter-number designator sounds more fitting for a robot in
a ``Star Wars'' film than a spacecraft in a fleet of shuttles
bestowed the stately titles of Atlantis, Discovery and Columbia.
   ``It's not our job to give it a name,'' shuttle production chief
Seymour Z. Rubenstein of Rockwell International, the principal
shuttle contractor, said cheerfully in a recent interview. ``That's
the government's job.''
   Actually, the replacement shuttle's name will be the brainstorm
of school children who submit entries in a national competition
that opens this fall.
   After several elimination rounds, the administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration will select a winner
in May 1989, said Bill Green, a Rockwell International spokesman.
   Only one thing is certain about the name.
   ``It definitely won't be Challenger 2, or anything like that,''
Green said.
   While OV-105 waits for a name, about 100 subcontractors and
2,000 Rockwell shuttle program workers are giving the $1.3 billion
orbiter its shape in Downey, a suburb of Los Angeles, and in
Palmdale, the Mojave Desert city 50 miles north of Los Angeles
where final assembly is to take place.
   Already, the space vehicle's wings have sailed through the
Panama Canal from Grumman Corp. on New York's Long Island on their
journey to the Mojave Desert. The nozzles that guide the orbiter as
it flies through space hail from McDonnell Douglas Corp. in St.
Louis. Other key components are made at Rockwell facilities in
Oklahoma and Ohio, and additional parts are being flown in from
dozens of other locations across the United States.
   When the new shuttle is finished, it will look almost exactly
like the three others in the fleet.
   ``Essentially it will look the same,'' said Rubenstein,
president of Rockwell's Space Transportation Systems Division.
   That there are no drastic changes from previous shuttles is a
point of pride for Rubenstein, one of the principal original
designers of the shuttle.
   ``No other country could have built it,'' he said. ``It's a
well-designed product built by a tremendously dedicated work
force.''
   Even though it looks the same as earlier orbiters, it will
incorporate all the improvements found necessary by the Rogers
Commission, which investigated the launch disaster that took the
lives of the Challenger crew 2{ years ago.
   Most notable is a crew escape system _ a telescoping pole the
crew could use to slide down and then parachute to the ground or
into the water. Such a bailout system, a version of which was added
to Discovery before its current flight, could not have saved the
Challenger crew.
   The new shuttle also will have upgraded electronics and an
improved braking system, changes that also are being incorporated
into the rest of the shuttle fleet.
   Like its predecessors, OV-105 is taking shape in a complex where
the Apollo capsule and Apollo-Soyuz command modules were built.
Rockwell also built the X-15 rocket plane and the P-51 Mustang
fighter plane.
   ``This company is rich in aviation and space heritage,''
Rubenstein said., ``The company has a history of building aircraft
and spacecraft that were on the leading edge.''
   Congress gave the go-ahead to build the replacement shuttle on
July 31, 1987. It is scheduled to be delivered in April 1991 and
fly in space in 1992.
   Work on production and assembly of the new orbiter is nearly
half complete because the company got approval in 1983 to built a
set of ``structural spare parts.'' The spares were actually key
components of a shuttle superstructure that were to be used if a
shuttle was ever damaged.
   ``No one had planned on the loss of a vehicle,'' Rubenstein said.
   But, after Challenger, the spare parts functioned ``like an
insurance policy'' in speeding production of the replacement
orbiter. Many major shuttle components, like the aft fuselage
section, take as long as five years to machine because they must be
forged from titanium and measured to a high degree of precision.

<TEXT>
   For two months in the summer of 1968 the
student movement gained momentum. ``Mex-i-co, Li-ber-ty!'' they
shouted. On Oct. 2, army machine guns silenced them, 10 days before
the city's Olympic Games.
   That night, the Night of Tlatelolco, was one of the bloodiest
ends to the protests that shook the world in 1968. Officials put
the death toll at 29, but students said hundreds were killed.
   The movement withered and seemed to die. But 20 years later,
festering discontent with a political system governed by a single
party reemerged in an unprecedented vote against the still-dominant
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
   ``At the very high price of lives, of blood, of prison for many
people, the '68 movement opened a democratic channel that kept
swelling until it overflowed in 1988,'' said Gilberto Guevara, one
of the principal leaders of the movement.
   In the July 1988 general elections, the opposition made
unprecedented gains in Parliament against the PRI, in power since
1929.
   Mexico in 1968 was still in its ``miracle years'' of economic
expansion. The authoritarian government dominated unions, campesino
organizations and the press.
   Despite the growth, ``distances between the classes also were
growing and that wasn't the heritage expected of a government that
said it came from a revolution,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a leading
political analyst who teaches at Columbia University.
   On July 26, two student marches, one commemorating the Cuban
revolution, merged and headed toward Zocalo Plaza, site of the
National Palace and the Metropolitan Cathedral. Police blocked them
and the clash lasted several hours.
   In the weeks that followed, students battled police with
slingshot-launched rocks and Molotov cocktails. Police countered
with clubs, guns and fixed bayonets. Soldiers fired a bazooka to
break down the door of one high school.
   More than 250,000 students went on strike. Demands emerged _
elimination of riot police, firing of the police chief, freedom for
political prisoners and abolition of a law on political crimes.
   The students also called for fundamental changes _ democracy,
political participation, respect for basic freedoms _ and began
directly attacking President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz.
   The army occupied the National University, site of the 1968
Olympic Stadium, in violation of its autonomy. With the Oct. 12
opening of the Games approaching, it pulled out on Sept. 30.
   On Oct. 2, more than 6,000 students rallied in the Plaza of the
Three Cultures, known as Tlatelolco.
   As the demonstration began, there was the whump of a mortar and
red and green flares flashed.
   ``There was an infernal shooting,'' said Guevara, who was on a
fourth-floor balcony with other student leaders. ``Bullets,
bullets, bullets. Until suddenly a tank began to fire at the
building. The building caught fire.''
   The official death toll was 29. Students placed it at 200 to
300. Only two were soldiers. Many of the casualties were people in
apartments or stores.
   About 300 people, including Guevara, Alvarez and other leaders,
were jailed for 2{ years.
   The students never gained significant support from labor or
peasants. But when the problems they pointed out weren't corrected,
other sectors joined their criticisms.
   ``It's 20 years later, through the electoral process, when
everything explodes again, now without violence, but in a much more
massive way,'' Alvarez said. ``The great contribution of '68 was to
show that political activity was respectable and necessary.''
   Indeed, Sunday, more than 100,000 people chanting ``Don't Forget
Oct. 2'' filled the Plaza of the Three Cultures to commemorate the
student movement.
   The meeting also was a rally in support of the left, which has
numerous leaders from the '68 movement and has the backing of the
current National University student organization.
   Raising their arms in clenched fists or ``V'' for victory, they
yelled ``Death to the PRI.''
   ``This is a reencounter of the revolutionary, democratic,
progressive forces to tell (President-elect Carlos) Salinas de
Gortari and (President) Miguel de la Madrid that this nation is not
going to continue tolerating imposition,'' said Heberto Castillo, a
leader of teachers who supported the students in 1968.
   Castillo ran for president for the Mexican Socialist Party, then
withdrew in favor of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
   ``'68 marked our lives and determined our destinies,'' Guevara
said. ``All those from '68 took on themselves an enormous burden of
responsibilities ... politics took deep roots in us ... in a sense
of commitment, commitment to construction of democracy, commitment
to the people, to the poor. `68 is almost a religion, an ethic.''

<HEAD>Aboriginal Law Stops Hunt For Killer Crocodile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aboriginal elders today invoked tribal
laws to protect a crocodile that killed a member of their tribe,
telling police to stop hunting the reptile because it is sacred.
   Police reported that aboriginal clans were holding a tribal
meeting to decide what to do after a 25-year-old aborigine of the
Gumatj tribe in the Northern Territory was found bitten in half at
a pond.
   The victim was not identified but was believed to have been
snatched while camping alone 10 miles from the mouth of the Cato
River. An autopsy was to be carried out in Darwin after the upper
half of his body was found Sunday.
   Police wanted to search for the rest of his body by shooting
saltwater crocodiles that inhabit the Cato River of Arnhem Land,
near where the attack took place.
   But aboriginal elders today gave police strict instructions not
to shoot or even approach any crocodile they suspect is responsible
until a decision is made.
   Saltwater crocodiles are found across northern Australia. The
reptiles were declared a protected species in 1974 when they were
threatened with extinction because of indiscriminate hunting for
their skins. Conservationists now note that crocodiles, which have
no natural predators, have grown in size and have lost their fear
of man.
   At least 11 people have been killed by crocodiles in the past
two years.
   Brian Walsh, the Northern Territory Conservation Commission's
chief wildlife officer, said local aborigines regard crocodiles as
sacred.
   ``You have to realize that in East Arnhem Land the crocodile is
of totemic significance and is very important to the culture ... so
they won't make any decision until they have all sat down and had a
meeting about it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Americans overwhelmingly believe the federal
government is rife with corruption, with seven in 10 saying they
think illegal payoffs are common, a Media General-Associated Press
poll has found.
   On specific cases, a plurality in the national poll said former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III should have been charged with
crimes, and half opposed a presidential pardon for the highest
official charged in the Iran-Contra case, former National Security
Adviser John M. Poindexter.
   Respondents were evenly split on a pardon for Poindexter's
assistant, former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   More fundamentally, the poll of 1,125 adults found deep
skepticism of the federal government's integrity. Just 40 percent
thought of the government as honest overall, while 50 percent said
not. The rest didn't know.
   An even greater share, 69 percent, said the federal government
was poorly managed _ and more still, 82 percent, said they were not
surprised to learn of recent allegations of payoffs in the awarding
of Pentagon contracts.
   But the poll's most critical finding was the broad belief that
corruption pervades the federal government: Seventy percent said
they thought that taking illegal payoffs for special favors was
widespread.
   That belief carried for majorities of all demographic groups _
from a low of 60 percent of Republicans to a high of 82 percent of
liberals. Overall, just 20 percent of respondents did not believe
payoffs were widespread.
   The Reagan administration, however, did not carry heavy blame
for the concern over ethics. While 43 percent said the
administration had done a bad job of enforcing ethical standards in
government, 40 percent said it had done a good job. That was within
the poll's three-point margin of error.
   There were other signs of good will toward the Reagan
administration. Fifty-one percent said it had done a good job of
managing the government, even though most said the government was
poorly managed overall. And 55 percent did not blame the
administration for the Pentagon scandal.
   In the Iran-Contra case, Vice President George Bush has said he
hopes for an acquittal of North, who with Poindexter is accused of
conspiring to sell arms to Iran in exchange for American hostages,
and to divert the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. The trial will
not take place before the Nov. 8 election.
   Fifty percent of the poll's respondents said Poindexter should
have been charged; 30 percent said not and the rest didn't know.
There was a greater division on North, who gained support through
his defense of his actions at congressional hearings last year:
Forty-three percent said he should have been charged and 42 percent
said not.
   The breakdown was the same on whether President Reagan should
pardon the men, which he has not ruled out. On Poindexter, half
opposed a pardon and 30 percent favored it; on North, 41 percent
were in favor, 44 percent opposed.
   Meese, attorney general since 1985, resigned this summer, saying
he had been vindicated of corruption allegations by a special
prosecutor's decision not to seek charges against him. The
prosecutor said Meese probably violated tax laws and conflict of
interest laws, but did not file charges because he had no evidence
Meese sought personal gain.
   In the survey, however, 46 percent said Meese should have been
charged with crimes, to 30 percent who agreed with the decision not
to charge him. The remainder, 23 percent, had no opinion.
   Republicans were the strongest supporters of North, Poindexter
and Meese, with Democrats the greatest critics and independents
more divided. On ethics and management as well, Republicans
strongly supported the administration and most Democrats rated it
poorly. Most independents said the administration had done well on
management, but they were split on ethical enforcement.

   Early returns in Veracruz state elections
showed Mexico's ruling party losing 15 of 203 mayoral seats in the
first local balloting since the opposition scored unprecedented
gains in July.
   The Excelsior news service said opposition parties, hoping to
continue inroads made against the ruling party in the July general
elections, claimed victories in more than 20 municipalities in the
Sunday vote.
   Official returns were scheduled to be made public on Oct. 9.
   Veracruz, a lush, productive state on the Gulf of Mexico, is a
key petroleum center with 3 million registered voters.
   In the 1985 municipal elections, the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, ran unopposed or against mostly token
opposition and won all but five of the 203 races. This time,
opposition parties fielded candidates in 177 races.
   State authorities said there were isolated incidents of violence
but did not give any details.
   Fraud was an issue in the July 6 general election, won by the
PRI's presidential candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari. He begins
his term Dec. 1, taking over from President Miguel de la Madrid.
   The opposition, made up of the leftist Democratic Front and the
rightist National Action Party, made its strongest gains ever in
the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
   The opposition claims the balloting was rigged by the PRI, in
power since 1929. The PRI denies the allegations.

<TEXT>
   The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen on the
Tokyo foreign exchange market today while share prices slumped on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   After opening at 133.78 yen, the dollar moved in a narrow range
of 133.72-133.95 yen in light trading before closing at 133.90,
down 0.40 yen from last Friday's close of 134.30 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely
followed barometer on the exchange, lost 154.60 points, or 0.56
percent, from last Saturday's close, to end the day's trading at
27,545.53.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major shares are listed, slackened to 650 million shares compared
to 1 billion last Friday.
   Exchange dealers said the weaker dollar reflects the poor
showing of the currency in overseas markets.
   ``It opened lower than last week's level, but there were no new
incentives to push down the dollar further,'' said an exchange
dealer at a major Japanese bank.
   ``Insurance firms and institutional investors would start buying
the dollar if it declined to the mid- to lower 133-yen level
anyway, so I don't expect it to go down too much further than where
it is now for a while,'' said the trader, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Securities dealers attributed the sluggishness in share prices
and trading volume to a lack of fresh incentives in the market.
   ``The market environments are not necessarily poor,'' said a
dealer at a major securities firm, referring to stable exchange
rates and the strong performance of the world economy. ``But the
market had no direction this morning.''
   They also said news of Emperor Hirohito's weakening condition
last Saturday is affecting the market negatively.
   ``It's been a pattern that share prices slump every time we hear
about a worsening in the condition of His Majesty the emperor,''
said a broker at a major securities firm.

   Discovery's five astronauts headed
back to Earth today after a remarkably smooth four-day flight that
kept their pledge to the Challenger crew and ``resumed the
journey'' of Americans into space.
   The shuttle travelers were on course to ignite re-entry rockets
for a fiery hourlong dash through the atmosphere. Touchdown was
scheduled for 12:37 p.m. EDT on a dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force
Base in California's Mojave Desert.
   The astronauts were awakened shortly before 4 a.m. EDT with a
parody of the Beach Boys' song ``Fun, Fun, Fun'' radioed up by
Mission Control. ``We'll have fun, fun, fun until we gotta put the
shuttle away,'' a musical group chorused.
   ``Like the Beach,'' Discovery commander Frederick H. Hauck told
Mission Control. ``That is outstanding, outstanding. Thank you very
much... You do good work.''
   Thousands of people were already gathered in the desert Sunday
to cheer their dramatic arrival, and Vice President George Bush was
expected to greet them. The weather looked fine for a landing.
   Hauck and his crew were coming home from the first shuttle
flight since the Challenger explosion of Jan. 28, 1986, and on
Sunday they poignantly remembered the five men and two women who
died in that tragedy.
   In an emotional message which they took turns reading, Hauck,
pilot Richard O. Covey, mission specialist George D. Nelson, John
M. Lounge and David C. Hilmers eulogized their fallen comrades as
``fellow sojourners'' and friends and expressed ``reverence for
those whose sacrifice made our journey possible.''
   ``At this moment, our place in the heavens makes us feel closer
to them than ever before,'' Nelson said as the television screen
showed the tail of Discovery silhouetted against a striking view of
Earth 184 miles below.
   ``Lest we ever forget...that to ascend to this seeming tranquil
sea will always be fraught with danger, let us remember the
Challenger crew whose voyage was so tragically short,'' said Covey.
   ``Today, up here where the blue sky turns to black,'' said
Hauck, ``we can say at long last to Dick, Mike, Judy, to Ron and
El, and to Christa and Greg:
   ```Dear friends, we have resumed the journey that we promised to
continue for you. Dear friends, your loss has meant that we could
confidently begin anew. Dear friends, your spirit and your dreams
are still alive in our heart.'''
   The seven who died aboard Challenger were Richard Scobee,
Michael Smith, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka,
Gregory Jarvis and schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.
   Following the memorial, Discovery's astronauts held a 20-minute
news conference from space while gathered in the middeck in front
of a photograph of the Challenger crew.
   ``It's good to be back to where they wanted to go so badly,''
Lounge commented.
   Replying to questions from reporters at the Johnson Space Center
in Houston, the crew expressed pleasure over Discovery's
performance and the results of the mission, during which they
released a $100 million communications satellite from the cargo bay
and conducted a dozen science and technology experiments.
   Hauck had said before the flight that because more than 200
modifications had been made, flying Discovery would be like testing
a new spacecraft. He said then he expected some equipment
surprises, but reported Sunday ``the machine worked superbly,''
with only a few minor glitches.
   He said, however, there would be a discussion ``with the folks
on the ground'' about the bulky, uncomfortable spacesuits the
astronauts have to wear on liftoff and landing to take advantage of
a new escape system.
   The experiments were wide-ranging, from growing crystals in
weightlessness to testing a laser beam communications system.
Nelson said all ``exceeded my expectations in the way they have
run.''
   Lounge was asked what he would say to the two presidential
candidates to convince them to support the space program. He
answered this way:
   ``This is a very important flight simply because it's the first
step. I would hope that all of the enthusiasm that we've seen
throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens
and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if we're going to make
this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to to get us
on the path to the future.''
   The shuttle redesign following Challenger focused on the
solid-fuel booster rockets that caused the accident. But extensive
modifications also were made to the orbiting vehicle, the main
engines and the external fuel tank.
   Among changes to the orbiter were several to improve the
performance of the brakes and steering system for landing, with an
eye toward eventually returning shuttles to Earth on the concrete
runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, just two miles from
the shuttle launch pad.
   Landings in California add nearly $1 million to the cost of a
shuttle mission and delay a spacecraft's return to flight because
of time lost in having to ferry it back to the launch area bolted
to the top of a Boeing 747 jet.
   Only five of the 24 pre-Challenger missions ended in Florida,
and each resulted in tire wear or damage because of problems with
the brakes or steering system.
   After Discovery blew one tire and damaged another on the 16th
mission in 1985, all subsequent landings were made on the wide-open
dry lakebed at Edwards.
   The Rogers commission that investigated the Challenger accident
recommended that all landings be scheduled for California until the
new systems have proved themselves, using the Florida runway only
in an emergency.
   Design improvements included strengthening the main landing gear
axles, changing the electronics to equalize pressure put on the
brakes and changing the brake pad material for better performance.

   Here is a transcript of the tribute
by the Discovery astronauts Sunday to the crew of space shuttle
Challenger. NASA said the astronauts wrote the statement
themeselves and took turns reading it.
   David C. Hilmers:
   We'd like to take just a few moments today to share with you
some of the sights that we've been so privileged to view over the
past several days.
   As we watch along with you, many emotions well up in our hearts
_ joy for America's return to space, gratitude for our nation's
support through difficult times, thanksgiving for the safety of our
crew, reverence for those whose sacrifice made our journey possible.
   John M. Lounge:
   Gazing outside, we can understand why mankind has looked toward
the heavens with awe and wonder since the dawn of human existence.
We can comprehend why our countrymen have been driven to explore
the vast expanse of space, and we are convinced that this is the
road to the future, the road that Americans must travel if we are
to maintain the dream of our Constitution to secure the blessings
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
   Richard O. Covey:
   As we, the crew of Discovery, witness this earthly splendor from
America's spacecraft, less than 200 miles separates us from the
remainder of mankind. In a fraction of a second our words reach
your ears. But lest we ever forget that these few miles represent a
great gulf, that to ascend to this seemingly tranquil sea will
always be fraught with danger, let us remember the Challenger crew
whose voyage was so tragically short.
   George C. Nelson:
   With them, we shared a common purpose; with them we shared a
common goal. At this moment our place in the heavens makes us feel
closer to them than ever before.
   Those on the Challenger who had flown before and seen these
sights, they would know the meaning of our thoughts. Those who had
gone to view them for the first time, they would know why we set
forth.
   They were our fellow sojourners, they were our friends.
   Frederick H. Hauck:
   Today, up here where the blue sky turns to black, we can say at
long last to Dick, Mike, Judy, to Ron and El and to Christa and
Greg: Dear friends, we have resumed the journey that we promised to
continue for you. Dear friends, your loss has meant that we could
confidently begin anew. Dear friends, your spirit and your dreams
are still alive in our heart.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Appeals For International Aid For Students</HEAD>

   The leader of Burma's strongest rebel
group today appealed for international aid for the students who
have fled to his bases seeking military training to topple the
country's authoritarian government.
   Hundreds of students, some of whom had led recent
anti-government demonstrations in Burma, gathered on a large, open
field at this Karen camp as Gen. Bo Mya, spoke to Thai and foreign
correspondents.
   Some Burmese Buddhist monks were also present.
   Bo Mya said the Karens would allow the students to set up
independently run camps where the rebels would provide military
training and arm the students for a war against the military-run
government in Rangoon.
   Two small groups of students reportedly have already been given
rudimentary training and have slipped back into Rangoon, where
hardline Gen. Saw Maung staged a military coup Sept. 18 and
ruthlessly put down pro-democracy protests.
   ``Now, the students are urgently in need of international
assistance for the success of their movement,'' said a statement
from the Karen National Union.
   He said his rebel group presumed the international community
realized the rebels had insufficient weapons and ammunition of its
own.
   Bo Mya said he has received no response to letters sent to the
United States, Japan, Great Britain and other governments
describing brutal conditions in Burma and urging them to halt all
aid to Rangoon.
   The rebels, who have fought the central government for four
decades, said nearly 3,500 people had sought refuge in
Karen-controlled areas along the Thai-Burmese border, including
1,545 at his base about one mile from the Thai frontier.
   ``The persecution, killing and hostile searches are still going
on in Rangoon and other cities. We believe many more will be
coming,'' Bo Mya said.
   By official count, about 425 persons have been killed since the
Sept. 18 coup. Western diplomats and opposition figures say
casualties were far higher, while several thousand are reliably
believe to have died as the military put down earlier
demonstrations.
   Student leader Winn Moe, who also appealed for foreign aid, said
the students expected many more colleagues to join them once
independent, functioning camps were set up.
   ``We will try our best to see that they (students) will have the
best privileges we can offer but we are not rich revolutionaries
and we do not have enough ourselves,'' Bo Mya said.
   Karen spokesman Em Marta said some problems had already surfaced
among the students, who have formed an All Burma Federation of
Student Unions. These included leadership disputes and factionalism.
   ``They are young, enthusiastic and very impatient. We cannot
fight our enemy with that,'' Em Marta said.
   This base is located 43 miles south of the key Thai border town
of Mae Sot and several days' walk from Rangoon to the west.
   The Karens rose up against the central government in 1949 saying
that earlier promises of considerable autonomy had been broken.
Since then, a dozen ethnic minority groups have also taken uy arms
against Rangoon and together control large areas along the
Thai-Burmese border.
   Ten of the rebel groups, including the Karens, are banded
together in a loose National Democratic Front, which claims to
field 35,000 guerrillas. The Karen National Union says it has
17,000 soldiers who are widely regarded as good jungle fighters.

<HEAD>Armani and Gigli Give a Young Start to Summer Collections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 spring-summer ready-to-wear shows
have gotten off to a young start with Giorgio Armani's trendy
Emporio girls and the romantic maidens of Romeo Gigli.
   Both designers used teen-age models Sunday to underline the
youthful look of their collections, but whereas Gigli's girls
looked like they walked out of a Degas ballet scene, the Armani
kids wore jeans and sweatshirts with slogans and designs printed
everywhere.
   The Emporio line was invented several years ago by Italian
ready-to-wear genius Giorgio Armani to satisfy the needs of the
younger set in both style and pocketbook. But it does not exclude
those who are merely young at heart.
   There are plenty of neat cotton pant suits, with small jackets
and loose trousers, long skirts, demure blouses and stand-by
blazers to enhance an older woman's town and country wardrobe too.
   Slogans and designs on clothing are the big thing among Italian
youth these days and Armani picked up on this trend. The phrase
``100 Percent Summer'' can be read on T-shirts, blouses and even
earrings.
   Animals are a favorite design with llamas and elephants
stitched, painted or pinned on shirts, pants and jackets.
   The choice of animals reflects the folklore inspiration of the
collection. Armani draws on India for his sari-type skirts,
super-loose pants and glittery beaded jackets, while from Peru he
borrows geometric designs and bright colors, as well as the popular
Indian flat-topped bowler hat.
   Bright shades always seem a strain for Armani, used to the muted
tones of his native industrial Milan, and when not involved in
folklore fantasy he reverts to his standard beiges, grays and navy
blues.
   Except for a few micro-mini tube dresses and some very short
shorts, Armani pulls his hemlines right down to the ankle for next
summer.
   Whereas the lengthened hemline at Armani marks a change from
last season's mini, the look at Gigli is long and drab as per usual.
   His jackets in cotton, jersey or linen had that old thrift-shop
look, oversized, with maddeningly long sleeves that always looked
like they needed hemming.
   Pants were trim and vaguely tailored, the most modern item in
the collection.
   The newest look at Gigli's is the knot, with which he tied
together hemlines, bodices and waistlines. Aside from enhancing the
Orphan Annie look of the collection with make-do mending, the Gigli
knot could become the latest rage in geometric puzzles. In fact it
takes either a genius or a good set of instructions to figure out
where and how to tie them.
   The five day semi-annual Milan ready-to-wear shows will end
Thursday, and will include the new spring-summer collections of
such fashion favorites as Ferre, Krizia, Versace and Missoni in
addition to Italy's ``numero uno,'' Armani.

<DATELINE>TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York overcame her
much-publicized fear of reptiles long enough to linger today at a
pool full of dangerous sea snakes.
   ``I dont want to leave because I am fascinated by these
creatures,'' the former Sarah Ferguson told her husband, Prince
Andrew, at the Townsvilles Great Barrier Reef Aquatic Wonderland
soon after the Royal couple started their four-day tour of
Queensland state.
   The Duchess grimaced as she tentatively touched a live sea
cucumber, a marine inhabitant of tropical waters, in a special open
``touch'' tank at the multi-million-dollar tourist attraction.
   The royal couple were greeted by sweltering tropical heat when
they touched down at Townsvilles Airport today after spending four
days in Sydney on their bicentennial tour.
   Sarah and Andrew will fly to the remote towns of Cloncurry and
Mount Isa on Tuesday before going to Brisbane Wednesday.

<HEAD>Police Reportedly Foil U.S. Embassy Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police thwarted a planned guerrilla attack on
the U.S. Embassy, arresting two armed men while the others fled,
according to a newspaper report.
   Two guerrillas armed with guns and explosives were detained
outside the heavily guarded downtown embassy at about noon
Saturday, Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said. He was
quoted Sunday in the daily El Comercio, Peru's leading newspaper.
   There were no reported injuries during the arrests.
   Mantilla, head of Peru's anti-subversion effort, would not
identify the guerrilla group involved. The embassy and its
installations have been the targets of more than a dozen attacks in
the past decade by leftist guerrillas, who accuse the United States
of conducting imperialistic policies toward Peru.
   Mantilla told El Comercio the guerrillas planned to attack the
walled, half-block embassy complex with several accomplices who
escaped. The newspaper did not provide further details.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Loveridge told The Associated
Press that embassy security staff were unaware of the incident. He
said the embassy was investigating the report.
   Loveridge said U.S. government installations are considered at
high risk and are heavily guarded with U.S. Marines, privately
hired security staff and Peruvian police guards.
   In the last attack against the embassy, rebels of the pro-Cuban
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement in June fired mortar rounds at
U.S. Ambassador Alexander Watson's residence compound, damaging the
roof but causing no injuries.
   The Maoist Shining Path guerrilla organization also has been
linked to attacks against U.S. government installations.

   The Summer Olympics will be remembered
for moments of glory like that enjoyed by U.S. diver Greg Louganis
and the startling moment of disgrace when the gold was stripped
from Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.
   The Soviet Union won the first U.S.-Soviet Olympic medal contest
since 1976, getting 55 gold medals to 37 for East Germany and 36
for the United States. Host South Korea rose to fourth in the world
with 12 golds.
   The fear of terrorism and massive civil unrest prompted
extraordinary security, but neither bogey materialized as nearly
10,000 athletes from 160 countries tested their mettle in 16 days
of competition ended Sunday.
   As always, there were shining moments of glory, from an opening
ceremony with exotic dancers and parachutists to a closing with
hugs and tears, fireworks and dances, and the mascots of Seoul and
Barcelona, the site of the 1992 Games, floating together into the
starry night.
   Louganis claimed his second pair of gold medals after hitting
his head on a springboard. He said he talked with his coach about
quitting the Olympics after hitting the board and opening a cut
that needed five stitches to close.
   ``We walked and discussed all the things we had gone through to
get there,'' he said. ``I decided to stay in, and I'm glad I did.''
   Louganis said Sunday he is retiring from diving to begin an
acting career.
   What had been the highest moment of the Games _ Ben Johnson
rocketing to victory over U.S. great Carl Lewis in a 100-meter dash
world record _ led to the deepest pain when the Canadian was caught
cheating with muscle-building anabolic steroids.
   Twenty years from now, when most of the records set in Seoul are
broken, the impact of Johnson's disgrace will still be felt if
athletes and trainers heed the events here and end doping.
   ``There have been high points and some low points, and the most
important low point was Ben Johnson,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee, said today.
``That was indeed a blow.''
   But catching Johnson and expelling him and nine other athletes
with positive drug tests was an indication that ``we have won the
battle against doping,'' Samaranch said.
   Sports officials from the United States and the Soviet Union on
Sunday announced Sunday they would join forces to work towards the
elimination of drugs from sport.
   A statement issued by the U.S. and Soviet Olympic committees
said the groups would investigate using the exchange of testing
teams, lab results and technical data; education programs; and
uniform penalties.
   For the United States, a serious problem at the Seoul Games was
a rising tide of anti-American sentiment.
   It was exacerbated by NBC's coverage, which the Koreans saw as
anti-Korean and insensitive to local culture; the arrest of several
American athletes; and the perceived rudeness of the U.S. team at
the opening ceremony.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, cultivated friendship by bringing in the
Bolshoi Ballet, the Moscow Philharmonic, films, a photo exhibit and
copies of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   The announcement of an unprecedented sports exchange program
between South Korea and the Soviet Union and the arrival of the
first Soviet diplomats since World War II also warmed relations.
   Soviet athletes, as they did in Calgary, Canada, during the
Winter Games, made a special effort to meet with local people.
American athletes tended to isolate themselves.
   All those differences became apparent at the sporting events,
where Koreans often cheered louder for the Soviets or East Germans
than they did for Americans, despite a close 40-year relationship
with the United States.
   Still, there were Louganis and other Americans to unabashedly
cheer for _ like sisters-in-law Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, who led an assault on the track and field record
books, and Louganis.
   Griffith Joyner won golds in the 100, the 200 and the 400-meter
relay, and silver in the 1,600-meter relay. She set a world record
in the 200 and an Olympic record in the 100. Joyner-Kersee won two
golds, taking the heptathlon with a world record 7,291 points and
the long jump with an Olympic mark of 24 feet, 3{ inches.

   A Brooklyn teen-ager says he'll do his homework
``a little more often'' now that space shuttle Discovery's
commander has read one of his assignments in space.
   Philip J. Morgan wrote a letter to shuttle commander Frederick
H. Hauck last May as an assignment for his eighth-grade science
class at St. Mark's Catholic School.
   ``I am a worried 14-year-old that is worried about the future,''
he wrote. ``I feel that some of America's future is riding on you
and your crew's shoulders. I give you all the inspiration I can
give you because your ride this fall means so much to me.''
   Hauck interrupted the crew's schedule Saturday to read the
letter. He said he hoped it would show young people that ``we are
back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits that will
come in the future.''
   Interviewed Sunday after he came in from playing football with
friends, Morgan, known as ``P.J.,'' said Hauck had eased his fears
``a lot,'' but he is still worried ``because there are always
risks'' in any space mission.
   Morgan's teacher, John D. Santoro, said he gave the assignment
as a way of introducing current events into the science class. Of
85 letters, Morgan's was the only one to draw such a personal
response, Santoro said. Other students received autographed
pictures from the astronauts they wrote.
   ``I thought the fact they had gotten pictures was great,''
Santoro said. ``But when he read the letter yesterday _ this was
unreal.''
   Hauck called Morgan last week and said he might read the letter
from space.
   ``I didn't think he'd really read it. I didn't think there would
be enough time,'' the youngster said.
   Morgan said he was surprised at the attention his letter has
attracted. ``It was meant as a homework assignment. I didn't even
imagine it would go this far.''

<HEAD>Three More Rightwing Renegades Arrested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today arrested three more
renegade soldiers sought in last year's bloody coup attempt and
seized $5,000 apparently earmarked to finance a new mutiny, the
military announced.
   Col. Oscar Florendo, chief military spokesman, said Air Force
Lt. Col. Francisco Baula, Philippine Constabulary Capt. Roque
Maranon and trainee Inocencio Cuyuca were arrested around noon at a
bar along Manila Bay.
   Baula was former operations officer of the 420th Supply Wing of
the Philippine Air Force and led the takeover of Villamor Air Base
in Manila during the Aug. 28, 1987, attempt to topple President
Corazon Aquino.
   Maranon was among dissident officers who took over Camp Olivas,
a constabulary garrison in central Luzon, during the failed
attempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300
wounded. He was formerly a member of the Presidential Security
Group during the administration of ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Florendo said the three would be charged with mutiny. He
presented the renegade soldiers to reporters, but they made no
statement.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila area commander, said $5,000 in
pesos was found in Baula's car. Asked whether the money was to
finance a new coup attempt, Biazon replied ``it's for the boys,''
meaning rebel recruits.
   Last week, Biazon told reporters that unidentified businessmen
and opposition politicians were under surveillance for possible
links to the mutineers.
   The arrests bring to more than 70 the number of rightwing
extremists captured in recent weeks. They include former soldiers
linked to Marcos.
   Florendo refused to speculate when the military would recapture
the leader of the 1987 coup attempt, former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan.
   Honasan was arrested last December but escaped the following
April from a prison ship in Manila Bay. Last Tuesday, security
forces arrested former Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano, another key
leader of the August 1987, uprising, during a raid on a hotel in
Quezon City.
   Matillano also escaped last April in a separate incident.
   During today's news conference, Florendo also announced the
arrests of eight New People's Army rebels operating in the capital.
He said the eight, most of them teenagers, were apprehended in
raids Saturday and Sunday near Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of the
Philippine Army.
   He said the eight were believed to be members of urban guerrilla
assassination teams, which have claimed responsibility for killing
scores of soldiers and police in the Manila area.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told a congressional committee
last week that about 2,800 rebels and sympathizers were believed to
be hiding in Manila.
   Florendo said the eight were working as sidewalk ice cream
vendors.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Head: Secret Service Rivalries Thwarted Hostage Efforts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with quotes from Fadlallah interview, quote
from news agency not appearing in magazine. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rivalries between intelligence agencies
have sabotaged efforts to help free foreign hostages, the spiritual
leader of an umbrella group believed to be holding the hostages
said in an interview published today.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also said the issue of
the hostages had become political rather than humanitarian.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for underground
Shiite extremist factions holding most of the 17 foreigners missing
after being kidnapped in Lebanon since March 1985.
   Fadlallah told the English-language Monday Morning magazine that
``the struggle of intelligence services and of states is such as to
set at nought our best efforts'' on behalf of the hostages.
   ``The issue was until recently a humanitarian one with political
dimensions,'' Fadlallah was quoted as saying. ``Now it has become
wholly political, so a discussion of it necessarily implies a
discussion of relations between the states involved and the
kidnappers.'' He did not elaborate.
   Fadlallah was responding to a question about reports that
American hostages will be released soon and that the kidnappers of
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite were awaiting specific responses
from the British government.
   The Christian-controlled local news agency al-Markazia on Sunday
issued advance excerpts of the Fadlallah interview with Monday
Morning. The broadcast quoted Fadlallah as saying that the hostage
ordeal was nearing its end.
   ``When the hostage question shifts to high-level talks between
big powers, and they start speaking of deadlines, that means the
question is nearing its end,'' Fadlallah was quoted as saying.
   That quote did not appear in the interview published by the
magazine and there was no explanation for the discrepency.
   In Jerusalem, the editor of an Israeli newspaper said Sunday
that negotiators for the United States and Iran were holding talks
near Geneva on the release of eight Amercan hostages and one
British hostage.
   Hesh Kestin, managing editor of the Nation newspaper, said the
talks included delegations representing Iran and the United States
and ``a mixed group'' of intermediaries. He did not elaborate.
   The Nation, an English-language weekly that began publication a
month ago, reported Friday that the United States has struck a
secret deal with Iran, promising economic aid and arms sales in
exchange for the release of eight of the nine American hostages in
Lebanon.
   It said the deal would include the release of frozen Iranian
assets in U.S. banks and the resumption of diplomatic relations.
   President Reagan, White House officials and the State Department
all denied the report.
   According to the Nation, which quoted unidentified sources in
Geneva, Iran would secure the release of five American hostages on
or around Oct. 7. A second group of hostages, including three
Americans and a Briton _ possibly Waite _ would be released a week
later, the report said.
   All are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.
   The newspaper report said the U.S. put aside its demand that
Tehran release Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, one of the nine
Americans, because officials were convinced Iran does not control
the kidnappers holding him.
   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to
negotiate the release of hostages.
   In Beirut on Saturday, kidnappers holding three American
educators and an Indian professor said they would release one
hostage as a good-will gesture.
   The group, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free,
or when.

   Auto tycoon Henry Ford II, who
coveted his privacy in life, has had his affairs dragged into
public view in death.
   Bickering over his $350 million trust between Ford's third wife,
Kathleen DuRoss Ford, and the rest of the Ford family boiled over
in a public courtroom last week, with more than a dozen lawyers and
a horde of reporters present.
   Mrs. Ford's lawsuit against her stepson, Edsel B. Ford II, tried
to block the appointment of a new trustee. Although a last-minute
settlement was all but approved last week, the ordeal left its mark
on the Ford clan.
   ``I don't think there can be a victory in a case like this for
anybody, said George Kemsley, an attorney for Edsel Ford. ``Henry
Ford desired privacy and that wish for privacy was disregarded.
Consequently I think everybody lost.''
   By the standards of Palm Beach, where manicured hedgerows and
private guards keep unwanted eyes from intruding on the affairs of
wealthy residents, the publicity was especially disturbing.
   ``Everything my father did in life he did very quietly and very
unassumingly,'' Edsel Ford told The Associated Press. ``His
business life is a matter of record, but his family life was
something he cherished a great deal. He was a very private man.''
   Henry Ford II took control of Ford Motor Co. in 1945 from his
dying grandfather, auto pioneer Henry Ford. At age 28, he cut
unprofitable divisions and hired new managers, making daily
decisions that built the family company into a worldwide auto
empire.
   He divorced his second wife, Christina, in 1980 and married
Kathleen, a 40-year-old former model, in Carson City, Nev. None of
his children attended the wedding.
   Before he died of pneumonia at 70 a year ago, Ford named
Kathleen sole beneficiary of the trust until her death, when the
money would pass on to his six grandchildren.
   He named three trustees: Kathleen, son Edsel, and lawyer Martin
Citrin, the husband of one of Mrs. Ford's close friends.
   But in April, Citrin committed suicide and the trouble began.
   Ford's hand-picked alternate trustee, William Donaldson, asked
for a $1 million annual fee. Edsel Ford said Donaldson, a former
undersecretary of state and founder of the Yale School of
Organization and Management, was worth it. Mrs. Ford called it
extortion and sued to block Donaldson's appointment.
   She claimed in a court deposition that Edsel Ford and Donaldson
threatened to reduce her income from the trust to the minimum $1.5
million spelled out in the will, a charge Edsel Ford vehemently
denied.
   He also denied any animosity existed between his stepmother and
the rest of the family.
   ``This ill-will thing is strictly a function of
sensationalism,'' said the son of Ford's first wife Anne, who
remains uninvolved in the trust dispute.
   Attorneys narrowly avoided an open court battle by agreeing to
settle the lawsuit hours before a hearing early last week in Palm
Beach County Circuit Judge Vaughn Rudnick's courtroom.
   But before Rudnick could approve the settlement, lawyers for the
grandchildren balked, demanding that a legal guardian be found to
ensure their clients get their share of the trust.
   Retired Circuit Court Judge Robert Hewlitt, called by some the
``gentleman judge'' of Palm Beach County, was appointed and is
reviewing the settlement.
   If Hewlitt and Rudnick approve it, only one obstacle will keep
the family's finances in the public eye: Christina Ford's $5.4
million alimony claim against the estate. A motion to dismiss her
claim was rejected Wednesday by yet another Palm Beach County judge.

<HEAD>School Official at Center of Rare Vermont Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Concern about official wrongdoing in Vermont
was once so minimal that from the 1930s to the 1960s a Statehouse
window was kept open for officials and others who'd forgotten their
keys.
   Then came the Bennington school scandal.
   ``As far as I can tell, never in the state's history has there
been something of magnitude,'' said state archivist Gregory
Sanford. ``The cases have always involved an individual, not a
network.''
   So far it has led to four convictions, including the school
district's treasurer and a school board member, numerous
resignations and the decertification of six educators.
   At the center is George Sleeman, who served for 13 years as
superintendent of the Southwest Vermont Supervisory Union, the
state's largest school union.
   He faces four trials, the first of which began last week. In
all, he is accused of 37 counts of embezzlement and perjury.
   His reign is compared to those of the old ward bosses in big
cities outside Vermont, who managed to get dead people to vote on
Election Day. Sleeman is accused of running classes that never met
and had at least one dead person as a student.
   ``George Sleeman took money for his own purposes, money that was
in his care because he had the trust of the people who put him in
that position; money that was intended to go to help in the
education of children,'' state prosecutor David Suntag told jurors
as Sleeman went on trial for nine of 37 counts of embezzlement and
perjury.
   The issue in the first trial is whether Sleeman improperly paid
himself $8,000 from school funds for increased rent on an office.
   Sleeman's lawyer, William Sessions, said Sleeman believed he was
authorized to receive the increased rent. He blamed the problems on
poor bookkeeping.
   ``There were no rules, no regulations, nothing on how accounting
should be,'' Sessions said as he described one of the accounts.
   Sleeman, suspended in 1985, has refused comment on any of the
charges against him.
   But the rent checks form a small part of the school scandal,
which began June 7, 1984, with the announcement the school system
had a deficit of $1.7 million.
   As auditors and investigators began looking into the deficit,
offices were burglarized and financial records disappeared.
   A break-in at Sleeman's office in which crucial records were
taken ``was not a burglary, but an attempt to make us believe it
was a burglary,'' a Bennington police detective said.
   Auditors said Sleeman ran a ``shell game,'' using about 140 bank
accounts for a school system that typically would have 10.
   The alleged corruption included bidding practices, which some
said were rigged to favor Sleeman's friends, and the food service
program.
   The food service program's former director, Donat Ratelle, said
he wrote checks to Sleeman because he told him to.
   ``You don't question the superintendent,'' Ratelle said.
   Asked why, he said, ``You don't know George Sleeman.''
   ``George searched for power, to be a ward boss,'' said Richard
Chapman, who served as interim superintendent following Sleeman's
suspension.
   Sleeman oversaw 4,400 students, 350 teachers, two dozen
administrators and at annual budget of $20 million.
   ``In this community, what George said, it came as authority. If
you didn't agree with him, he could do something to you,'' Chapman
said.

   The dollar eased in early European trading today
and foreign currency traders said the market had calmed following
the dollar's sell off Friday in New York.
   Gold prices barely moved.
   The dollar tumbled Friday following U.S. Federal Reserve
Governor Martha Seger's warning against a higher currency, and on a
sharp drop in oil prices.
   Traders in Frankfurt, West Germany, said they were disappointed
that Friday's surge of activity did not continue on Monday.
   ``We were really optimistic this morning, and we thought the
movement would continue with profit-taking, but it has fizzled out
again,'' said one dealer at a West German bank.
   ``There is surprisingly little interest among traders and
(commercial) customers. It looks as if we'll have the same story as
last week, but on a slightly lower level.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 133.90. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 133.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8687 West German marks, down from 1.8725
   _1.5840 Swiss francs, up from 1.5830
   _6.3580 French francs, down from 6.3700
   _2.1057 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1185
   _1,392.10 Italian lire, down from 1,396.50
   _1.2137 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2171
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6937, slightly more
expensive for buyers than late Friday's $1.6905.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $393.25 an ounce, down
from $394.45 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $394.20.
   ``This market has the look of no interest about it,'' said the
head of bullion at one London trading firm. ``There is very little
activity.''
   In Zurich, the bid price was $396.00, unchanged from late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.31 to close at a bid $397.91.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.11 an ounce,
little changed from Friday's $6.14.

<TEXT>
   Generoso Pope Jr., who built an empire on
The National Enquirer's splashy brand of journalism, was remembered
fondly by employees after his death of a heart attack at his
beachfront home. He was 61
   ``He was the paper,'' Enquirer Managing Editor Nat Chrnaz said.
``It's shattering. It really is.''
   Pope was taken to John F. Kennedy Medical Center on Sunday,
where he was pronounced dead, said hospital spokesman Larry
Schwingle.
   Pope had a fortune estimated at more than $150 million by Forbes
magazine.
   Known as a tough boss, he pushed his highly paid reporters _
many from Britain's Fleet Street _ to keep cranking out ``what
inquiring minds want to know.''
   ``He was not a person who was isolated in an ivory tower,'' said
Enquirer reporter Roger Capettini. ``The man rarely, if ever, took
vacations. He was involved in every aspect of the Enquirer. I think
Mr. Pope was a creative genius.
   ``It's a very sad occasion,'' Capettini said. ``He truly was
loved by his employees. He demanded a lot of us, but he rewarded
and compensated us.''
   While the Enquirer flourished, its style has many critics, and
several celebrities have sued the publication. Among them were
Carol Burnett, who sued for libel in 1981 and won $800,000; Frank
Sinatra, Cary Grant, and actress Shirley Jones all settled out of
court.
   Pope was a native of New York City and his father was the
founder of the Italian-language daily, Il Progresso.
   The younger Pope graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology at 19 and at age 25 bought the struggling New York
Enquirer with $75,000 he borrowed.
   ``I took over, then discovered the paper was about a week away
from bankruptcy,'' Pope said in a December 1985 interview. ``There
was just one employee and me. It took six years before we finally
broke even in 1958.''
   By changing the paper's format and adopting its glitzy, style,
he turned it into the best-read supermarket tabloid with a
circulation of 4.5 million.
   Pope said the paper evolved when ``I discovered that gore would
sell _ gory pictures, gory stories.'' He later shifted the focus
towards celebrity news and gossip, health tips and the bizarre. His
more sensational Weekly World News has another 1.1 million readers.
   In 1971, Pope brought his newspaper to Lantana, a coastal town
of 10,000 about nine miles south of Palm Beach. He put up and
decorated a 126-foot fir tree, a Christmas tradition ever since.
The tree draws thousands of people each year.
   Pope, Lantana's largest employer, was known for his generosity
to the community. He recently endowed the town with a rescue
vehicle, and was on the board of trustees for the hospital where he
died.
   Pope, who has six children, was married three times. His widow,
and wife of 29 years, is Lois Pope.
   A funeral Mass was scheduled Wednesday morning at Holy Spirit
Catholic Church.

   Gunmen burst into a west
Belfast house early today and shot a man to death, and four
children survived a gunfire attack at their home, police said.
   The Irish People's Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for killing a man they identified as Henry McNamee,
33, a Roman Catholic.
   The organization is a fragment of the Irish National Liberation
Army, itself an extremist offshoot of the Irish Republican Army.
Its claim was made in a statement to news organizations.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
said the man was shot several times at close range just before 3
a.m. A spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said he could not confirm the man's identity.
   The spokesman said the police force does not confirm or deny
whether specific individuals are providing them with information.
McNamee's brother said Henry McNamee had not collaborated with
police.
   In the other shooting, four children aged 1 to 12 and their
grandmother were unhurt when several men fired about 20 shots into
their house in south Belfast, police said. They said they were not
aware of any motive for the atack.
   In another development, the British army said it took seven
hours to defuse a 600-pound car bomb found in a stolen van in a
parking lot at Magherafelt, 42 miles northwest of Belfast.
   The bomb was detected by a police patrol Saturday night 90
minutes before the outlawed IRA called a local radio station to say
it was there. The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   In Londonderry, the second largest city in the province, police
said an unidentified youth was recovering in a hospital after being
hit in the stomach with a plastic bullet. The bullet was fired by
troops quelling a riot in the Roman Catholic Bogside area.

<TEXT>
   Army patrols in machine-gun mounted
jeeps and armored-personnel carriers patrolled this city and
Karachi today after ethnic violence left more than 215 people dead
in southern Pakistan.
   Pakistan President Ghulam Ishaq Khan arrived here today to tour
the scene of last Friday's bloody shooting spree in Hyderabad where
more than 150 people died, according to the national news agency,
APP.
   More than 50 people died in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city, a
day later in retaliatory rioting.
   The trouble is between Mohajirs, immigrants from India, and
Sindhi separatists who want Sind province to be independent of
Pakistan.
   Most of the dead in Hyderabad on Friday were Mohajirs. Members
of the immigrant community rioted in Karachi, 100 miles to the
southwest, on Saturday, killing most Sindhis.
   Violence continued Sunday when at least 17 people were killed.
   Two people were killed in Hyderabad in a shooting spree when
police briefly lifted a curfew.
   The two-hour break in the curfew was intended to give residents
an opportunity to buy food. Police quickly resumed the curfew after
the shootings.
   In Karachi, a group of people clashed with police Sunday and set
about a dozen vehicles ablaze. Eight people died before police
restored order, government authorities said.
   Police reported that seven people were killed in ethnic-related
gunbattles in the neighboring cities of Tando Adam and Mirpur Khas,
about 150 miles north of Hyderabad.
   Sind province officials met Ishaq Khan at the airport and
briefed him on the massacre. The president flew in from a brief
visit to Karachi.
   No new deaths were reported today.
   Ishaq Khan has called an emergency meeting of the provincial
Sind caretaker cabinet to get to the root of the violent ethnic
clashes which crept further into the interior.
   Pakistan's army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, said the
weekend carnage was part of a coordinated conspiracy to destablize
Pakistan as it prepares for national elections set for Nov. 16.
   The militant Sindhis are members of the Jeay Sindhi Movement,
who are seeking an independent homeland.
   The Mohajirs, who dominate the province's cities, have formed
the Mohajir Quami Movement to press for official recognition as a
fifth nationality in addition to the Sindhis, Punjabis, Baluchis
and Pathans.

<TEXT>
   The fate of three Haitian soldiers who forced
their way onto a New York-bound jet in Haiti will depend largely on
whether they were victims or victimizers in their Caribbean
country, a human rights official says.
   ``The question is: Are they worthy of refugee protection? ...
Are they merely fugitives from justice or are they refugees from
persecution?'' said Arthur Helton, director of the Political Asylum
Committee of the Lawyers for Human Rights.
   The three soldiers were arrested Saturday when American Airlines
Flight 658 arrived at Kennedy Airport.
   They boarded the plane in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince,
armed with rifles and seeking political asylum. But the pilot
persuaded them to surrender their weapons 15 minutes into the
flight and none of the 233 people on board was hurt.
   The soldiers were to be arraigned today in U.S. District Court
on charges of air piracy. The trio _ identified by Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey police as Edouine Noel, 24; Nicolas
Normil, 23; and Jean Charleston Bienaime, 23 _ could face
deportation or long U.S. prison terms, authorities said Sunday.
   No information has been made public that would answer Helton's
questions. The FBI, the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S.
Attorney's office were unable to provide any details Sunday about
the men's motives or background.
   As one of the soldiers was being led away in handcuffs at the
airport Saturday night, he called out to reporters that he fled
Haiti because of ``division a l'armee'' _ French for strife in the
army. He and his two comrades were still dressed in their
olive-green military uniforms and black boots as authorities took
them away.
   A Port Authority detective said Saturday night that the men
expressed concern about a ``communist takeover'' of Haiti, though
none of the turmoil in Haiti in recent weeks has been generally
attributed to communists.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was installed as president Sept. 17
following a coup by lower-ranking soldiers that led to the ouster
of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. The coup triggered a military uprising
that led to the ouster of military commanders loyal to Namphy and
the Duvalier family dictatorship that preceded him.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Johnny Frank said the three soldiers
could face maximum sentences of 20 years to life in prison if they
are tried and convicted of air piracy.
   The men can expect to be tried before their application for
political asylum is considered, Helton said. He said the request
for asylum could be granted even if the men are convicted, assuming
they can prove that they acted out of desperation.
   But if the men are shown to have been perpetrators of violence
in Haiti, they could be deported following their conviction, Helton
said.
   Another possibility is that the Haitian government would seek to
extradite the men, he said. Such a request would be considered
before a trial was held in the United States.

   A Japanese climber and a Sherpa guide
were swept to their deaths last week by an avalanche, the Nepalese
Tourism Ministry said today.
   Akihiko Mori, 43, of Tokyo and Ang Dawa Sherpa, 27, were
descending from 5,900 meters on Mount Annapurna I last Thursday
after having carried up food supplies and tents when the accident
occurred, the ministry reported.
   The two were about 30 minutes from their expedition's Camp One
when they were swept away by the avalanche, the ministry said.
   It said another Japanese, Tsuyoshi Ono, 43, from Saitama
prefecture near Tokyo was also with the two alpinists and escaped
injury but had to spend the night in the snow.
   Ono managed to reach one of the expedition's other tents Friday
morning to report the incident.
   The remaining seven members of the Japanese expedition and their
Nepalese staff started a search that continued until Saturday, but
the two missing mountaineers could not be found, the ministry said.
   Mori was the leader of the expedition tackling the 26,538-foot
Himalayan peak. The expedition reportedly abandoned its attempt
Sunday.
   It was the third fatal accident in the Nepalese Himalayas in the
current post-monsoon climbing season, which lasts from September to
November.
   Last month a Nepalese member of a British expedition died on
Mount Annapurna III and another Nepalese accompanying a Spanish
expedition died on Mount Everest, the world's highest peak.

   An amusement ride that had passed

a broken coupling, stranding 20 people upside down for more than an
hour, according to a state official.
   At least 12 people were treated at hospitals for dizziness and
other minor problems after the Super Loops ride at the Bloomsburg
Fair malfunctioned Saturday night, authorities said.
   ``They were up there upside down, waving their arms, just
hanging there,'' said fairgoer Vince Vangroski of Hazleton. ``They
started to panic a little bit. Being upside down for that period of
time is scary.''
   Neil Cashman, director of the state's Bureau of Amusement Rides,
said the ride had been passed by state inspectors Tuesday after a
worn-out wheel discovered by the ride owner's inspectors was
replaced.
   ``Everything was right up to par,'' he said.
   The ride's cars run inside a single large vertical loop, and are
attached to and pulled along by a flexible inner loop, he said. The
broken coupling attached a car to the inner loop.
   Passengers are held in their seats by lap and safety bars. A
safety cage runs the entire length of the train.
   Rescue workers had to move the train slowly to the bottom of the
loop to remove the passengers, Cashman said.
   He said his office would contact the ride manufacturer, LMC Inc.
of Texas, to find out whether similar problems had been reported
elsewhere. He said he had not heard of any prior problems with the
ride.
   According to the state's Amusement Ride Inspection Act, rides
must be checked every time they are set up. It was passed by the
state Legislature in 1984 after several accidents occurred on
traveling carnival rides.
   Cashman said a preliminary investigation does not indicate any
wrongdoing.
   A state police spokesman said about 100,000 attended the
agricultural exhibition and carnival Saturday, its last day. The
ride was dismantled early Sunday morning.

   Bavarian Gov. Franz Josef Strauss, a
leading ultra-conservative, died today after suffering a heart
attack that doctors said was likely caused by other internal
problems, the state government said.
   He was 73.
   The Bavarian government said in a statement released to the news
media that Strauss died at 11:45 a.m. (6:45 a.m. EDT) in a hospital
in the city of Regensburg.
   Strauss, one of West Germany's most colorful politicians who
helped organize the country after World War II and served in its
first Parliament, collapsed during a hunting trip Saturday.
   Strauss' daughter Monika and sons Franz-Georg and Max-Josef
joined political associates who gathered at Regensburg's Brothers
of Charity hospital, about 65 miles northeast of Munich, capital of
Bavaria.
   Dr. Rolf Manz, head of the medical team that had cared for the
governor, said Strauss had suffered a mild heart attack brought on
by an undetermined internal disorder.
   Strauss' thick Bavarian accent, coupled with his sharp tongue,
made the outspoken, stocky state governor one of West Germany's
most recognized and controversial politicians.
   He was the head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian
sister party of the nationally dominant Christian Democrats, which
are headed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   He served in a number of Cabinet posts, including minister of
defense and minister of finance. He left Parliament in 1978 when he
was elected Governor of Bavaria.
   In recent years, the outspoken Strauss often used his base in
Bavaria to steal the show from Kohl.
   In 1949, the year West Germany was founded, Strauss was elected
to the federal Parliament controlled by the conservatives under the
country's first Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer.
   His wife, Marianne, died in a 1984 automobile accident.

<TEXT>
   Sadness and joy blended at the 40th anniversary
celebration for St. Ignatius Catholic Church, one of 43 parishes
tagged by the archdiocese to close because of declining inner-city
membership.
   About 300 parishioners marked the occasion Sunday with Mass and
brunch. Red balloons carried the ironic theme of the long-planned
celebration: ``Life Begins at 40.''
   The Rev. Anthony Helinski, St. Ignatius' pastor, concluded Mass
by saying he has responded to the archdiocese's proposal with a
letter of appeal.
   ``When a bishop speaks, we don't goose-step,'' Helinski said, to
the cheers of parishioners. ``Catholic people must be consulted in
all aspects of their lives and certainly on something as important
as a change in their parish.''
   He said the proposal, which dealt another blow to a decaying
city, is unjust and ``not a way to deal with people today.''
   He said he believes all 43 churches designated to close and the
five that would merge with some of the closing churches will fight
the directive, which was announced Wednesday by Archbishop Edmund
Szoka.
   Leaders of the affected churches will begin developing a
strategy at a meeting tonight, Helinski said.
   The plan, which affects about 10,000 Roman Catholics, calls for
St. Ignatius' 150 families to merge with those at St. David's,
about a mile away. All of the churches are in Detroit except for
one in the suburb of River Rouge.
   The Detroit Archdiocese comprises 331 parishes in six counties
with about 1.5 million members. That figure is up from 900,000
after World War II, but most of that growth has been in the
suburbs. In 1976, more than 100,000 Catholic households were in
Detroit, as against fewer than 50,000 now.
   Helinski said he thinks the decision to close the churches is
also related to the shortage of priests.
   Parishioners were upset that the decision appears to contradict
what the church recently asked parishes to emphasize _ ministry to
the poor, sick and elderly.
   The announcement followed four years of study of urban parishes
by a task force, which concluded that 43 of the city's 112 churches
aren't viable.
   Mark and Beverly Clark Pattison, members of the St. Ignatius
church council, charged that the task force never looked closely at
the parish or gave it a fair chance to defend itself.
   ``They don't understand what it means to ask people to cross
three neighborhoods and a freeway to get to a Catholic church,''
Mrs. Pattison said.
   But Kay Federspiel, secretary at St. Ignatius for 20 years
before she moved from the neighborhood after her house was
burglarized, said she watched the church decline.
   ``There used to be 1,400 parishioners here; now there are maybe
300,'' she said. ``You see what the neighborhood is like around
here with the burned-out houses and you can't blame people for
moving away.''

   A 20-year-old man expelled from the Air Force
Academy because he lost part of his leg in an auto accident says he
believes the decision was a mistake, but now just wants to ``get on
with my life.''
   Dan Korslund lost his right leg 8 inches below the knee after
the June accident near the academy in Colorado. He walks with the
aid of a cane, and will soon be fitted with a prosthesis.
   Air Force Secretary Edward ``Pete'' Aldridge refused last week
to waive a Pentagon rule that calls for ``disenrollment'' of any
service academy cadet who loses all or part of a limb.
   Korslund, a cadet third class who would have been a sophomore
this year, said he didn't blame Aldridge or the Air Force, but
added that the decision was a disappointment because ``I felt I
should have had the chance to prove to them that I could have done
it.''
   He said he would try to return to the academy if there was an
opportunity to appeal Aldridge's decision, ``but I'm not going to
hold my breath. Now I just want to get on with my life.''
   Korslund said he intends to attend college and major in biology,
branching off into sports medicine.
   Sens. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and William Armstrong, R-Colo.,
had pressured Aldridge to keep Korslund in the academy. Armstrong
said he would ask President Reagan on Tuesday to consider the case.
   Korslund, who was discharged from the Seattle Veterans
Administration Hospital on Friday, is living with his mother in
Tacoma.

<HEAD>Chad, Libya Restore Diplomatic Relations After Years Of Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya and Chad, after years of bitter fighting,
announced today they have restored diplomatic relations and said
they will settle their territorial dispute in a responsible and
understanding manner.
   In a statement carried by the Libyan news agency JANA, which
said it was issued simultaneously in the capitals of Libya, Chad
and Togo, the two countries said they intended to ``establish
relations of good neighborliness and cooperation.''
   Diplomats from Togo were reportedly instumental in bringing
together Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi and President Hissene Habre
of Chad, long bitter enemies, to restore ties.
   In the statement, Chad and Libya said they would respect the
Sept. 11, 1987, cease-fire that ended their fighting in the
mountainous deserts of northern Chad and ``deal with their regional
disagreement in a peaceful way.''
   By the end of October, Chad will send an ambassador to Tripoli
and Libya will open a ``People's Bureau'' _ as it calls its
embassies _ in N'Djamena, the statement said.
   Habre ousted a Libyan-backed government in 1982 but only
succeeded in driving Libyan troops out of most of the country early
last year, in a series of lightning attacks by Chadian soldiers in
light trucks.
   The remaining territorial dispute concerns the Aouzou Strip, a
45,000-square mile band of land thought to be rich in uranium,
along the border between the two countries. Libya continues to
occupy the strip, which it contends was ceded by France to Italy in
1941 before Chad and Libya became independent.
   Libya had annexed the territory in 1973.
   Habre's government received extensive French and American
military aid for his battle with Libya. France sent several
thousand troops, equipped with anti-aircraft weapons and Jaguar and
Mirage warplanes to deter Libyan attacks on southern Chad,
especially N'Djamena.
   In Paris, the French government said in a statement it ``is
pleased by this decision which will open an era of peace between
the two countries.''
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told reporters that
France would consult with Chad before withdrawing the French force,
now down to about 1,200 men. He noted that the French presence ``is
not there to stay forever,'' and could be reinforced very quickly
from French bases in the neighboring Central African Republic in
case of renewed threat.
   Chad has been wracked by war almost continuously since it became
independent from France in 1960. When former rebel leader Goukouni
Oueddei was president from 1980 to 1982, he invited the Libyans
into the country, and they sent 7,000 men. Gadhafi announced plans
to merge the two countries.
   Habre ousted Goukouni in 1982, sending him fleeing to the north.
The following year Goukouni started a military drive on N'Djamena.
After Libyan troops became directly involved, France sent in an
intervention force and halted the advance.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France and Gadhafi signed a
mutual troop withdrawal agreement in late 1984 and the French
pulled out. Gadhafi reneged, to Mitterrand's embarrassment, and the
French sent their troops back to Chad.

<TEXT>
   A congressional candidate accused of linking an
airline and the AIDS epidemic became a man without a party when the
Colorado Democratic Party executive committee disowned him.
   Party officials voted 33-1 on Sunday to deny John Mitchell the
use of the name Democrat in his campaign after he failed to respond
to allegations stemming from a lawsuit filed against him by Trans
World Airlines.
   The airline has accused Mitchell, a Colorado Springs teacher and
real estate agent, of distributing posters connecting TWA with AIDS.
   ``The party needed to deal with this openly. Don't flinch, don't
blush, just do business, and I think that's what we've done here,''
said state Democratic Party Chairman Buie Seawell.
   Mitchell did not attend Sunday's meeting and has not been
available to talk with state party officials since the lawsuit was
filed Sept. 19 in U.S. District Court at Denver. He failed to
return calls to his home telephone answering recorder made Sunday
night by The Associated Press.
   According to TWA's lawsuit, which seeks $500,000 in damages,
Mitchell sent a poster to the airline's New York offices in July
saying ``Thousands of these have been sent around the country. Our
staff is working on a new poster. They will continue to be sent
until TWA corrects the hurt you have caused-cost me.''
   The posters, according to the lawsuit, said ``AIDS is Spread
Through TWA,'' ``Today's TWA Means AIDS'' and ``TWA: Travel With
AIDS.''
   Mitchell was unopposed for the nomination to run against
incumbent Republican Rep. Joel Hefley in a GOP-dominated district
which encompasses the Colorado Springs area. It was his first try
at political office.
   The 5th District Democratic Committee on Sunday issued a
complaint against Mitchell that later was accepted by the executive
committee and resulted in the party's disavowal of his candidacy.
   The complaint said Mitchell's failure to respond to the
controversy has hurt the campaigns of other Democratic candidates
in the district.
   The party's vote won't affect the ballot itself, which already
has been printed. Only a court order could have gotten Mitchell's
name off the ballot. Party officials said they preferred not to
take such a measure.
   Rick Daily, the party's attorney, said the party wasn't making a
judgment on TWA's allegations against Mitchell but was moving
against him only ``because of Mr. Mitchell's failure to act like a
responsible candidate and step forward and deal with those issues.''
   Mitchell's squabble with TWA apparently began in 1983 when he
took the airline to small claims court in two separate cases in
Colorado Springs to recover ``frequent flyer'' benefits he believed
he deserved.
   Mitchell won one case but lost the second one. Shortly
afterward, TWA said it received posters and stickers anonymously
connecting the airline with AIDS.

   Israeli-backed Christian militiamen shelled
a U.N.-policed vilage in south Lebanon today, wounding an Irish
peacekeeper, three Lebanese women and an 8-year-old boy.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon, said the Irishman was injured in the head when a 60mm
mortar round crashed into one of the Irish battalion posts in
Qabrikha, 18 miles east of Tyre.
   He declined to give the Irishman's name.
   Lebanese police later said four villagers, including three women
and a boy, also were wounded in the bombardment.
   Police said the South Lebanon Army militia opened up on the
Shiite Moslem village after a roadside bomb exploded in the village
of Qantara, in Israel's self-designated securitu zone in south
Lebanon. It as not clear whether anyone was hurt in the explosion.
   The 2,000-man militia patrols the 6-to-10-mile deep security
zone jointly with Israeli troops.
   The buffer was established after Israel withdrew the bulk of its
occupation force from south Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year
invasion.

   Soviet officials today capped the biggest shake-up
in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 3{ years in power by replacing Politburo
member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov as premier of the Russian republic.
   The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic, the largest of the
15 Soviet republics, elected Interior Minister Alexander V. Vlasov
_ an ally of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev _ as the new premier.
Vlasov was named a candidate member of the Politburo during a
central committee meeting Friday.
   The 62-year-old Vorotnikov was moved to the ceremonial job of
president of Russia. Vladimir P. Orlov, the 67-year-old president
of the republic, retired.
   Vlasov had been named a candidate member of the Politburo during
a Central Committee meeting on Friday.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev recommended the
changes.
   The latest changes come after Gorbachev led the most dramatic
political changes in the Soviet leadership of his 3{ years in power.
   Today's meeting of the Russian Supreme Soviet in the Grand
Kremlin Palace comes two days after the national parliament elected
Gorbachev the country's president to replace 79-year-old Andrei A.
Gromyko.
   On Friday, Gorbachev pushed a major shake-up through the
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee. He retired two
full and two candidate Politburo members, promoted four other
people and streamlined the Central Committee's apparatus.
   Vorotnikov and Ukrainian Communist Party leader Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky are the only two members of the ruling 12-man party
Politburo who were there before Gorbachev took power.
   One Western diplomat in Moscow, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Vorotnikov was considered a ``swing'' vote on the
Politburo. He generally supported Gorbachev's reforms, but was
``not real outspoken, cautious, not zealous,'' the diplomat said.
   Vlasov had worked in Gorbachev's home area of southern Russia
before becoming interior minister, in charge of the police, in
1986. His replacement is to be named by national authorities.
   Vorotnikov was first deputy premier of the Russian republic in
1975-1979, but lost the support of the Kremlin leadership in the
last years of President Leonid I. Brezhnev and was made ambassador
to Cuba. He was summoned back to Moscow after Brezhnev's death in
1982, and became premier of the republic the following year.
   Gorbachev's election Saturday by the 1,500 deputies of the
national Supreme Soviet unified the party and gave him both the top
government and party jobs _ and more power to force through his
programs of reform.
   Gorbachev has advocated a more powerful presidency than the
largely ceremonial job held by Gromyko, who was elevated to the job
in July 1985 after serving 28 years as Soviet foreign minister.
   On Friday, Gorbachev isolated Yegor K. Ligachev _ widely thought
to be the leading conservative on the Politburo _ by placing him in
charge of farm policy. He also eliminated another member of the
Politburo Old Guard, Mikhail S. Solomentsev, and retired candidate
Politburo members Vladimir I. Dolgikh and Pyotor N. Demichev.
   Friday's hastily called meeting of the policy-making Central
Committee elevated economist Vadim Medvedev from the committee's
secretariat to full Politburo status and streamlined the committee
structure, giving key Gorbachev allies important responsibilities.
   The Politburo changes left the Kremlin with no clear No. 2 man,
a position that generally had been regarded as Ligachev's.
   Sources said the decisions for change were thought to have been
made at a Politburo meeting Sept. 26, after which top officials on
overseas trips were ordered back to Moscow.
   The Saturday session of the national parliament also selected a
new chief of the KGB secret police, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, to
replace Viktor M. Chebrikov. Chebrikov moved to a job overseeing
legal and judicial affairs in the party's Central Committee
apparatus.
   Nikolai V. Talyzin, a candidate Politburo member and former
chief of the State Planning Committee, was demoted from first
deputy prime minister to Soviet ambassador to the Council for
Mutual Economic Assistance, the trade bloc of the Soviet Union and
its allies.
   Alexandra P. Biryukova, the highest-ranking woman in the Kremlin
hierarchy, took on new responsibilities. She was named a candidate
member of the Politburo on Friday and the next day was made a
deputy prime minister.

<HEAD>Court To Decide On Christmas Displays at Government Buildings in
Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether displays of a Christmas nativity scene and a menorah,
symbolizing the Jewish holiday of Chanukah, should be allowed at
two government buildings in Pittsburgh.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that each display
violated the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and several Pittsburgh
residents challenged the displays in a 1986 lawsuit.
   Since 1981, a nativity scene or creche depicting the birth of
Jesus Christ has been displayed inside the main entrance to the
Allegheny County Courthouse for about six weeks during the
Christmas season.
   A block away, an 18-foot menorah has been displayed each year on
the front steps of the City-County Building since 1982.
   A federal trial judge refused to order the dismantling of the
displays last Christmas. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled, by a 2-1 vote last March 15, that the displays unlawfully
promote religion.
   ``The only reasonable conclusion is that by permitting the
creche and the menorah to be placed at the buildings the city and
county have tacitly endorsed Christianity and Judaism and have
therefore acted to advance religion,'' the appeals court ruled.
   The creche is owned by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic
men's group. The menorah, a nine-branched candelabrum, was donated
by Chabad, a Jewish organization.
   The Supreme Court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to
include nativity scenes in officially sponsored holiday displays.
   In that ruling, the justices let Pawtucket, R.I., officials
place a creche in a Christmas display because such decorations as
Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen also were included.
   But lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a
narrow one, and have disallowed various Christmas displays deemed
too religious.
   Since a 1970 Supreme Court ruling, courts have been using a
three-part test to determine whether some government action
violates church-state separation.
   A law or governmental practice is not a violation of religious
freedoms if:
   _It has a secular, or non-religious purpose.
   _Its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion.
   _It does not foster ``excessive governmental entanglement'' with
religion.
   The 3rd Circuit court said the displays in Pittsburgh advanced
religion, and therefore were unconstitutional.
   In dissenting from the appeals court ruling, Judge Joseph F.
Weis Jr. said, ``This aggressive `neutrality' ... will lead not to
accommodation but to animosity, not to tolerance of but to
hostility toward, religion.''
   The appeals court decision was appealed by Allegheny County,
Pittsburgh and Chabad.
   The cases are Allegheny County vs. ACLU, 87-2050; Chabad vs.
ACLU, 88-90; and Pittsburgh vs. ACLU, 88-96.

   Orders to U.S. factories, bolstered by a big
jump in orders for military goods and transportation equipment,
rose a sharp 3.1 percent in August, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods in
August rose $6.8 billion to $226.6 billion, rebounding from a 3.6
percent decline in July, the steepest in 18 months. The June
increase of 5.4 percent had been the biggest jump in 17 years.
   Excluding the volatile defense goods category, orders rose 2.7
percent in August following a 0.6 percent decline a month earlier
and a 2.9 percent rise in June.
   Orders for durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, jumped 5.9 percent, following a 7.4 percent
fall in July and an 8.7 percent increase in June. This sector has
swung widely from month to month, influenced by volatility in
transportation orders.
   Orders for transportation equipment were up 19.0 percent
following a drop of 22.5 percent in June and a 33.3 percent jump in
June. The department said the August gain to $34.8 billion, which
included a 167.1 percent rise in orders for military ships and
tanks, was led by a $1.6 billion gain in aircraft and a $3.0
billion jump in motor vehicles and parts.
   In other categories, orders for primary metals including steel
fell 1.8 percent and electrical machinery was off 0.1 percent.
Other machinery orders, apparently helped by spending by
manufacturers to expand capacity, rose 6.3 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods were off a slight 0.1 percent
$103.6 billion. Increases in rubber and plastics, paper and tobacco
offset declines in chemicals, petroleum, textiles and clothing.
   Total orders for the first eight months of the year have
averaged $217.7 billion a month, 7.8 percent higher than a year
ago. Manufacturing, helped by a boom in export sales fueled by the
lower value of the dollar, has been one of the strongest areas of
the economy.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 2.1 percent in August
following a 1.0 percent decline in July.

   An armed man stormed the Moroccan
consulate today and threatened staff in the building before
surrendering to police, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported in the incident, but several staff
members were still hiding in the building, according to police
spokesman Hans Stoop.
   The man rushed the consulate in the city's port district and
surrendered after negotiating with police shortly afterward, Stoop
said.
   He had been carrying a firearm and used it to threaten consulate
staff, several of whom had fled the building, Stoop said.
   However, an undetermined number of workers had fled upstairs,
Stoop said.
   Heavily armed police entered the consulate to make sure they
were safe and there were no other attackers, he added.
   It was not immediately clear what the man's motives or his
nationality were, Stoop said. The weapon was also not immediately
identified.
   There have been occasional reports of friction among the
180,000-member Moroccan guest worker community in the Netherlands
and their government.

<HEAD>Abuse Alleged in Elephant Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A zoo advocacy group is calling for an
investigation into the cause of a half-dozen puncture wounds on the
head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was
trying to treat the wounds.
   ``What we're talking about here is abuse,'' Sandra Keller,
spokeswoman for Citizens for a Better Zoo, said Sunday. ``We have
been receiving complaints about the way these elephants are being
mistreated for several months.''
   Veterinarian Gail Hedberg was treating an abscess on the head of
a 3{-ton Asian elephant named Tinkerbelle when the animal attacked
her Saturday, fracturing her pelvis.
   Zookeepers said Tinkerbelle did a ``handstand'' on the woman.
Hedberg was listed in stable condition today at San Francisco
General Hospital.
   Some officials defended practices at the San Francisco Zoo.
   ``We have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may
appear abusive because we're not talking about puppy dogs and pussy
cats here,'' said zoo director Saul Kitchener. ``How do you get a
10,000-pound elephant's attention?''
   Elephant keeper Michele Radovsky said beating an elephant is no
different from ``people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their
dog.''
   But Paul Hunter, a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said the
abscess on Tinkerbell's head was caused by someone hitting her too
hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook.
   ``The elephants get beaten up real bad, and I'm getting tired of
it,'' said Hunter.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Lottery Ad Issue in Minnesota Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the federal government may continue to bar newspapers from
carrying advertisements for privately run lotteries and other games
of chance.
   The justices said they will study a Minnesota Newspaper
Association challenge to a postal law effectively prohibiting such
advertising.
   The court also said it will judge the validity of the postal
law's effective ban on newspapers publishing lists of lottery
winners.
   A federal judge in Minnesota last Dec. 31 upheld the ban on
newspaper advertising but struck down as unconstitutional the ban
on publishing lists of lottery winners.
   The Minnesota newspapers group's appeal said the ban on
advertising violates free-speech rights.
   In a separate appeal, Justice Department lawyers asked the high
court to reinstate the ban on publishing lists of lottery winners.
   Federal postal law contains an exemption for a state-conducted
lottery published by a newspaper in that state or in an adjacent
state.
   The controvery acted on today focuses mainly on lotteries and
other gaming, such as bingo and raffles, sponsored by non-profit,
charitable organizations and others.
   Lawyers for the Minnesota newspapers said, ``The revenue
generated by charitable gaming is very sustantial. In Minnesota
alone it appears to exceed $200 million per year.''
   Postal laws prohibit use of the mails to disseminate information
about any lottery not run by a state. Since nearly all newspapers
rely on the mail for at least a portion of their distribution, the
postal laws apply to them.
   U.S. District Judge Paul A. Magnuson upheld the ban on lottery
advertisements even though he acknowledged that the ads are a
constitutionally protected form of commercial speech.
   He said Congress has two substantial interests in the ban:
preserving the states' power to prohibit or limit gambling within
their borders and restricting the interstate growth of private
lotteries to reduce the threat of organized criminal involvement.
   But Magnuson ruled that newspapers cannot be barred from running
lists of private lottery winners unless such lists are found in
advertisements.
   ``Lists of prizes awarded do not fit the definition of
commercial speech. A prize list also has value as news,'' the judge
said.
   The cases are Minnesota Newspaper Association vs. Postmaster
General, 87-1943, and Frank vs. Minnesota Newspaper Association,
87-1956.

<HEAD>Court Will Weigh Pipeline Fee Case from Oklahoma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case that could bear
on a wide range of federal fees and taxes, today agreed to judge
the validity of a 1986 federal law imposing ``user fees'' on
pipeline companies.
   The justices said they will hear a Reagan administration
challenge to an Oklahoma court ruling that struck down the law. A
pipeline company that transports hazardous liquids had attacked the
law as unconstitutional.
   Administration lawyers said a number of recently enacted user
fees could be affected by the case.
   They cited the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
assess nuclear power plants for licensing and inspection and the
authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose
fees to finance its regulatory programs.
   Directly involved in the case acted on today are fees _ or taxes
_ imposed on pipeline companies that transport hazardous waste and
natural gas.
   The government is seeking to collect about $8.5 million a year
from the companies to pay for federal pipeline safety programs run
by the Department of Transportation.
   At issue is whether the assessments are fees or taxes and
whether the law grants the secretary of transportation too much
discretion in determining how much money the companies must pay.
   U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner in Tulsa, Okla., ruled last year
that the assessments are taxes, and therefore the law improperly
gives the transportation secretary power to set tax rates.
   ``Where no request for an agency's services is made and no
specific benefit is conferred upon the one being assessed, the
assessment cannot be labeled a fee,'' Wagner said.
   He added that the law gives the secretary so much discretion
that ``the amount to be assessed each company could be almost any
figure from zero to 100 percent of the entire'' cost of the safety
program.
   The assessments may be based on how many miles of pipeline a
company operates, the quantity of natural gas or liquid and how far
it is shipped, or the gross revenue of the company.
   The law was challenged by Mid-America Pipeline Co., assessed
$53,000 in 1986.
   Wagner said that depending on what formula the transportation
department chose, Mid-America could be required to pay from 5
percent to 28.3 percent of the $8.5 million total to be collected.
   The case is Burnley vs. Mid-America Pipeline, 87-2098.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. David E. Satterfield III, a
conservative Democrat who represented Virginia's 3rd District in
Congress for 16 years, has died at age 67.
   Satterfield died Friday of heart failure at the Medical College
of Virginia Hospital, said college spokeswoman Stephanie Halloran.
   He was first elected to the House in 1964 from the Richmond area
district and retired in 1980. Before entering Congress, he served
on the Richmond City Council from 1954 to 1956 and in the Virginia
House of Delegates from 1960 to 1964.
   In Congress, Satterfield was known as a stauch defender of
tobacco interests. His support of conservative causes hurt him with
his more liberal Democratic colleagues in the House and cost him a
subcommittee chairmanship in 1979.
   When he retired, Satterfield supported a Republican to succeed
him, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley.
   ``He was a good friend, and he was very helpful to me when I was
first elected,'' Bliley said. ``He has helped me in every election
since.''
   Satterfield is survived by his wife, two sons and a brother. A
memorial service was scheduled for today in Richmond.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Antitrust Appeal by California, Minnesota, Alabama,
Arizona</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, setting the stage for an
important antitrust ruling, today agreed to decide whether states
may sue in behalf of those indirectly affected by illegal
price-fixing.
   The court voted to hear an appeal by four states _ California,
Minnesota, Alabama and Arizona _ seeking to participate in a
multi-million-dollar settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix
cement prices.
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor disqualified
themselves from the case without explaining why.
   Lower courts had dismissed the states' efforts to sue for county
and municipal governments that had purchased cement or products
containing cement. The states sought the triple-damages awards
allowed under federal antitrust law.
   In throwing out the states' lawsuits, a federal trial judge and
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on a 1977 Supreme
Court decision. In it, the justices said federal antitrust law does
not permit indirect purchasers to sue.
   Under the 1977 ruling, if a manufacturer illegally conspires to
fix a product's price and sells it to a retailer, the retailer may
sue for triple damages. But if the retailer passes on the illegally
inflated price when selling the product to the ultimate consumer,
the consumer may not use federal antitrust law to sue.
   Lawyers for the four states, supported by the Reagan
administration, say Congress never intended federal antitrust law
to negate state laws protecting indirect purchasers.
   A spate of lawsuits were filed against cement manufacturers in
1976 and 1977, alleging a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices. Each
of the four states involved in today's court action filed a suit,
based in part on state laws protecting indirect purchasers.
   State laws in California, Minnesota and Alabama expressly give
indirect purchasers the right to sue.
   Arizona's law could be interpreted to permit such suits.
   The litigation was consolidated in federal court in Arizona, and
by 1981 cement manufacturers had agreed to pay $32 million to
settle the case.
   Direct purchasers then challenged the states' right to be
compensated for indirect purchases.
   U.S. District Judge Manuel L. Real dismissed the indirect
purchasers' claims in 1985, and the 9th Circuit court upheld his
dismissal last year.
   Reagan administration lawyers, in supporting the ensuing Supreme
Court appeal by the four states, said two key federal antitrust
laws ``contain no statement of congressional intent to preempt
state antitrust remedies.''
   ``In these circumstances,'' the administration lawyers argued,
``there is no basis for a conclusion that (federal antitrust law)
preempts state indirect-purchaser statutes.''
   They said at least 11 other states and the District of Columbia
have enacted laws expressly giving indirect purchasers the right to
sue.
   The states are Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland,
Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota and
Wisconsin.
   The case is California vs. ARC America Corp., 87-1862.

<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether communities may seek to protect young teen-agers by barring
anyone over 18 from dance halls or other establishments catering to
minors.
   The court said it will consider reinstating a Dallas ordinance
that licensed certain dance halls on the condition only teens 14 to
18 and their parents or guardians be admitted as patrons.
   A Texas appeals court struck down the ordinance, ruling that it
unduly interferes with young people's constitutionally protected
right to associate with whom they please.
   In urging the justices to reinstate the ordinance, Dallas
officials said, ``The potential harm comes from the association
with persons who may influence the behavior of the children not
only at the dance hall where supervision exists but also away from
the dance hall.''
   But the state appeals court last Oct. 29 ruled that the age
limit cannot be enforced.
   ``A child's right of association may not be abridged simply on
the premise that he `might' associate with those who would persuade
him into bad habits'' such as illegal use of drugs or alcohol, the
state court said.
   It added: ``It is primarily the responsibility of the parent,
not the city, to tell the minor how old his dance partner may be.
The answer lies in supervision, not in strict segregation by age
group.
   ``There is no showing that the less restrictive means of
supervision will be ineffectual to control the evil perceived'' in
allowing, say a 20-year-old, to enter the premises and peacably and
consensually dance with a 14-year-old, the state court said.
   The ordinance had been challenged by Charles M. Stanglin, who
operates the Twilight Skating Rink in Dallas.
   Stanglin has a so-called ``Class E'' dance hall license, issued
to those dance places catering to minors.
   He divided the floor of his skating rink so that patrons dance
or skate to the same music in full view of one another. No alcohol
is allowed inside.
   The ordinance he challenged forbids anyone not between the ages
of 14 and 18, except for parents or legal guardians of patrons, to
dance or even be on the premises.
   The state court struck down the age-segregation portion of the
Dallas ordinance but upheld that portion imposing midnight curfew
for such establishments.
   The case is Dallas vs. Stanglin, 87-1848.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study the
power of federal courts to decide some disputes in which a federal
agency takes charge of a failing state-chartered financial
institution.
   The justices said they will hear a Reagan administration
challenge to a ruling from Illinois limiting federal court
jurisdiction in cases involving the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. (FSLIC).
   Justice Department lawyers said the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling could have serious consequences for the FSLIC, under
financial strains to insure deposits in failing thrift institutions.
   The FSLIC and its parent agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, reported in September that they had added more than $12
billion in outstanding debt since mid-August while shutting down,
merging or finding new owners for 46 insolvent savings insitutions.
   At issue in the case acted on today was whether the FSLIC can
sue in federal court when it seeks to collect money, potentially
hundreds of millions of dollars, allegedly owed to the failing
thrift institutions.
   The 7th Circuit court ruled in November 1987 that the federal
courts lack authority when the alleged violations of federal law
are subsidiary to related allegations of state law violations.
  peals courts elsewhere have given broader
authority to federal courts to decide such suits.
   Justice Department lawyers said the 7th Circuit court ruling
could undermine efforts by the FSLIC to sue those who owe money to
failing savings and loan institutions.
   For example, the government's appeal said, it is now too late to
sue the Manning directors in Illinois state courts because of that
state's statute of limitations.
   The former directors urged the Supreme Court to reject the
appeal.
   The case is FSLIC vs. Ticktin, 87-1865.

   Two toddlers died of severe head injuries
and their father was found dazed and seriously injured in a roadway
minutes after a family quarrel.
   The three all received ``blunt trauma injuries'' early Saturday
while walking on a county road about half a mile from their home,
said Sheriff Wesley Walraven. Authorities had no suspects but said
it was unlikely that they had been hit by a car.
   Brandon Miles Frix, 2, was dead at the scene; his 3-year-old
brother, Jarrett, died later at an Atlanta hospital.
   The boys and their father, 27-year-old Charles A. Frix, left
their home on foot about 3:50 a.m. Saturday after the father and
his wife apparently quarreled, Walraven said. A passing motorist
found them lying in the road minutes later.
   Walraven said investigators have not found any evidence the
three were struck by a car. He declined to comment on other
possible causes until investigators are able to interview the
father.
   Michael Thomason, a volunteer firefighter, said Frix seemed
dazed and told rescue workers ``it don't matter'' when they asked
whether he and his sons has been hit by a car.
   ``He said, `Lord Jesus, take my hand, for I have sinned' _
that's all we could get out of him,'' Thomason said.
   Frix, who suffered head injuries, was listed in serious but
stable condition Sunday.
   There apparently were no witnesses, the sheriff said. Forsyth
Sheriff's Department Detective David Bennett said authorities
``just honest to God do not know how it happened.''
   The boys' mother told police she did not know what happened on
the road, Bennett said.

<TEXT>
   Kwan Fai Mak, convicted of 13 killings in what
Seattle prosecutors called the ``largest robbery-related mass
murder in American history,'' lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court let stand rulings that Mak received a fair trial and
properly was sentenced to death.
   Mak and Benjamin Ng were convicted of murdering 13 patrons of a
Chinatown gambling club in Seattle during a Feb. 18, 1983 robbery.
   Prosecutors said Mak planned and supervised the ``Wah Mee Club
massacre,'' and that one of his objectives was to leave no
witnesses.
   All patrons and employees present in the club during the robbery
were bound and, in turn, shot in the head from close range. One
patron, 61-year-old Wai Chin, survived to testify against Mak and
Ng.
   The Washington Supreme Court, in upholding Mak's conviction and
death sentence, said his crime ``set a new gauge for cowardly
murder in this state.''
   Mak, who emigrated from Hong Kong to Seattle when he was 15, was
21 when the crime was committed.
   His appeal contended that the state Supreme Court wrongly failed
to order an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Mak was denied
effective legal help.
   The case is Mak vs. Washington, 88-5114.

<TEXT>
   A New York City developer ordered to remove
the top 12 floors of a 31-story condominium building in Manhattan's
fashionable upper East Side lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the
building's height must be reduced even if construction was
permitted through a mistake by city officials.
   The developer, Parkview Associates, said it will lose more than
$9 million if forced to remove the top 12 floors of the building
located at the southeast corner of Park Avenue and 96th Street.
   The company bought the site in 1982 and received a construction
permit from New York City's Department of Buildings in 1985.
   Department officials misinterpreted a zoning map in permitting a
31-story building. The error was discovered in 1986, and the
department ordered the owners to stop work _ after the building had
been topped off at 31 floors.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
last February that ``the original permit in this case was invalid''
because it authorized construction above 19 floors.
   But the state court said the owner must share in the blame.
   ``Even if there was municipal error in one map and in the
mistaken administrative issuance of the original permit, those
factors would be completely outweighed in this case by the doctrine
that reasonable diligence would have readily uncovered'' the
correct limitations, the state court said.
   It also rejected arguments by Parkview Associates that the
city's order to reduce the building size is an unconstitutional
taking of property without due process.
   That issue cannot be addressed now because the builders have not
applied for a zoning variance, the state court said.
   Lawyers for Parkview Associates said it is the victim of
``grotesque mistreatment,'' stuck with a vacant building and
mounting losses while unable to get any income from the property.
   The case is Parkview Associates vs. New York City, 87-1837.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Illinois Decision About Working on the Sabbath</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider,
for the second time in two years, the authority of states to deny
unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath.
   The court said it will decide whether Illinois officials
lawfully refused to pay benefits to a man whose refusal to work was
not based on the doctrine of any established religious body.
   William Frazee of Peoria was disqualified from receiving
unemployment benefits after turning down in 1984 a temporary job
assignment that would have required him to work on a Sunday.
   Frazee said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of
Christianity is that non-emergency work on Sundays is forbidden.
   The Illinois Department of Employment Security State ruled that
Frazee's rejection of the job offering disqualified him from
receiving unemployment benefits. State officials said a refusal to
work due to religious convictions must be based ``on some tenets or
dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect or
denomination'' _ and not on individually held religious scruples.
   A state appeals court rejected Frazee's appeal. ``The injunction
against Sunday labor must be found in a tenet or dogma of an
established religious sect. (Frazee) does not profess to be a
member of any such sect,'' the appeals court ruled.
   In three previous rulings, the Supreme Court has barred states
from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse certain
work because of religious scruples. But in all three cases, the
workers' refusal was based on the teachings of an established
religious sect.
   The Supreme Court in 1963 struck down a South Carolina law that
kept a Seventh-day Adventist from collecting unemployment benefits
after she was fired for declining Saturday work.
   The court in 1981 ordered Indiana to pay unemployment benefits
to a Jehovah's Witness who quit when transferred by his employer to
a job producing turrets for military tanks.
   And in early 1987 the justices said Florida authorities had
violated a Seventh-day Adventist's religious freedom by denying her
unemployment benefits because she refused to work on Saturdays.
   The Illinois appeals court said the distinction between Frazee's
case the previous Supreme Court cases ``may be a thin and fragile
line.'' But it said the fact that Frazee's refusal to work on
Sunday is not tied to any established church ``is a dividing line
which we deem significant.''
   The Illinois Supreme Court refused to hear Frazee's appeal last
Feb. 3.
   The case is Frazee vs. Department of Employment Security,
87-1945.

<HEAD>Florida Must Pay for Destroyed Trees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that states must compensate tree nursery owners required to destroy
healthy citrus plants that may have been exposed to an infectious
disease.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Florida
officials who say the ruling could force the state to pay $250
million to nursery owners.
   The Florida Supreme Court ruled in January that the state must
pay two nurseries for destruction of their trees.
   The state court ordered a trial to determine how much money is
owed Mid-Florida Growers Inc. and Himrod & Himrod Citrus Nursery,
both based in Hardee County.
   During two weeks in 1984, the state agriculture department
burned 137,880 of Mid-Florida's trees and budwood, and 143,594 of
Himrod's.
   State officials said they were worried the plants were infected
with citrus canker that could spread if the trees were sold to
citrus growers.
   The nursery owners said the tree-eradication program was less a
means of preventing public harm than a way of maintaining public
confidence in the state citrus industry.
   The state Supreme Court agreed that ``destruction of healthy
trees benefited the entire citrus industry and, in turn, Florida's
economy, thereby conferring a public benefit rather than preventing
a public harm.''
   The state court also said there is a distinction when officials
destroy decayed fruit, unwholesome meat or diseased cattle. In
those cases, the property is worthless, the state court said.
   There was ample evidence the destroyed trees were healthy, the
state court said, adding that 50,000 citrus plants from the two
nurseries were sold to customers and no canker ever was discovered
on the buyers' premises.
   The state court said the nursery owners are entitled to just
compensation as required by the Constitution's Fifth Amendment when
officials seize private property.
   Florida officials said they could end up being forced to pay
$250 million to all nursery owners in the state whose trees were
destroyed to prevent the canker disease from spreading.
   The state's appeal was supported by Florida citrus growers and
officials from nine other states who said the nursery owners are
not entitled to compensation.
   The states are Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming.
   The case is Department of Agriculture vs. Mid-Florida Growers,
87-2123.

<HEAD>Court To Hear New York Case on Noise levels From Rock Concerts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City officials concerned about
ear-splitting noise levels at Central Park rock concerts won a
Supreme Court hearing today.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the city cannot
control the volume at concerts by using its own sound system
operated by a city-designated engineer.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June ruled that the
city's approach violates performers' freedom of artistic expression.
   The appeals court said, ``In the highly subjective realm of
music, legitimate regulation of noise levels does not justify
standardization. The required use of the city's system and
technician forces each performer and sponsor to filter its sound
quality, tone, mix and other aesthetic factors through the city's
technician and sound system.''
   City officials said the ruling is unrealistic, and they hinted
the ruling might even cause a riot if it leaves officials with no
other choice than ``pullling the plug'' on loudspeakers in the
middle of a concert.
   At issue are rules for concerts in Central Park's Naumburg
Bandshell, an amphitheater that is the city's most frequently used
park facility.
   The noise-control campaign is aimed at protecting visitors to
the park's neighboring Sheep Meadow, a 13-acre area decreed a
``quiet zone'' by Mayor Edward Koch in 1985.
   Park officials were concerned that rock groups unable to mix
their sound very well would resort to loudness to compensate for
that lack of skill. So the city hired a consultant to install and
run the sound system.
   The constitutionality of the plan was challenged by music groups
and Rock Against Racism, which sponsors an annual bandshell program
of speakers opposing racism.
   City officials noted that the organization's sound engineer,
when asked what should be the limit on noise, said, ``I think a
volume that causes people's ears to bleed would be too loud.''
   The 2nd Circuit court said the city may regulate the volume at
the concerts. But it said that could be enforced without requiring
the use of the city's sound system and engineer.
   If all else fails, the appeals court said, ``The plug can be
pulled on the sound to enforce the volume limit.''
   City officials replied, ``Pulling the plug during a concert
before a large, excited audience is not a practical alternative.''
   The case is Ward vs. Rock Against Racism, 88-226.

   Former U.S. Rep. Charlie Jonas, who was
known as ``Mr. Republican'' in North Carolina during his 20 years
in Congress, has died at 85.
   Some 250 people, including Republican Gov. Jim Martin, attended
a funeral service Saturday in Jonas' hometown of Lincolnton.
   Jonas, who died Wednesday, was first elected to Congress in
1952. He was re-elected nine times on a pledge of fiscal
conservatism.
   His father, Charles A. Jonas, was the state's first Republican
elected to Congress since the turn of the century.
   ``Charlie Jonas was a great inspiration to me in my political
career,'' said Martin, who succeeded Jonas in the 9th District
congressional seat before being elected governor. ``He was a good
counselor from time to time when as a young congressman, I needed
it.''
   Jonas is survived by a son and a sister.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Whether Student Rights Ignored in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case of widespread
interest among educators, today agreed to decide whether New York
state universities may ban some commercial activities in dormitory
rooms.
   The court said it will review a ruling that students' rights
were ignored when college officials barred a Pennsylvania cookware
company from conducting its sales pitch in dormitories.
   An appeal by the State University of New York (SUNY) to revive
the ban on its various campuses received support from university
officials in 10 states and groups representing thousands of college
administrations nationwide.
   The SUNY board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibit
most commercial enterprises from operating on state university
campuses.
   The ban was challenged by American Future Systems Inc., a
housewares company in Bryn Mawr, Pa., after one of its
representatives was arrested in 1982 at the state university campus
in Cortland, N.Y.
   She had refused to leave a dormitory.
   AFS attracts customers by offering free Florida vacations to
students who arrange sales demonstrations in their dormitory rooms
for groups of their friends.
   U.S. District Judge Neal P. McCurn upheld the SUNY ban against
such activities, ruling that AFS had no free-speech right to sell
its products on campus.
   But the focus of the case shifted on appeal. The company
withdrew as a plaintiff from the case and its lawyers now represent
SUNY students who are challenging the prohibition.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March noted the
change as it overturned McCurn's ruling.
   ``The case no longer involves an effort by outsiders to gain
access to university property,'' the appeals court said. ``Rather
it concerns only the constitutional rights of students in their
dormitories.''
   The appeals court added: ``The SUNY regulation survived
constitutional scrutiny (by Judge McCurn) only because the First
Amendment rights of students were ignored.''
   Without spelling out the details, the appeals court sent the
case back to the judge with instructions to ``draw a suitable
order'' that will not offend students' rights ``to receive
information and hear speech in their dormitory rooms.''
   The appeals court suggested the university find a less
restrictive means of meeting its legitimate interest in preventing
disruption and over-commercialization on campuses.
   In a friend-of-the-court legal brief, officials from
universities in 10 states said the appeals court ruling will
``seriously erode'' their power to control campus life.
   ``This case implicates far more than the sale of cookware by (a)
Pennsylvania pots and pans purveyor,'' the officials said. ``The
fundamental right of state colleges and universities to control the
use of their premises is at issue.''
   The officials are from state universities in California,
Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, South Carolina,
Rhode Island, New Jersey and Vermont.
   Other groups supporting the SUNY appeal are the American Council
on Education, the American Association of State Colleges and
Universities, the National Association of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges and the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators.
   The case is State University of New York vs. Fox, 87-2013.

<HEAD>Can States Make Employers Pay Vacation to Fired Workers?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether
states generally may prosecute employers for withholding accrued
vacation pay owed fired workers.
   The court said it will hear a Massachusetts appeal supported by
officials in 12 other states.
   The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled last May that
the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
preempts state prosecution of a bank president accused of denying
vacation pay to two fired vice presidents.
   The vacation pay was part of the bank employee benefit plan, and
states are barred by ERISA from using crimnal laws to enforce such
plans, the state court said.
   ``We conclude that a company policy providing for payments to
employees upon discharge of unused vacation time ... is an employee
welfare benefit plan within ERISA,'' the state court said.
   It added that the situation would be different if, for example,
state officials alleged that an employer stole money from an
employee benefit plan. That type of misconduct would be subject to
state laws prohibiting thievery, the state court said.
   ERISA is designed to protect worker benefits, but it differs
from a criminal law providing fines and jail terms for violators.
   The Massachusetts court barred the prosecution of Richard
Morash, presiden of The Yankee Bank for Finance and Savings.
   The Yankee Companies Inc. in May 1984 acquired the financially
troubled Home Savings Bank.
   Two vice presidents, Christopher Winslow and William Tuttle,
were fired a year later. Winslow said the bank owed him $14,520 for
66 unused vacation days and Tuttle said he was owed $11,146 for 42
unused vacation days.
   State prosecutors filed criminal charges against Morash after he
refused to pay most of the money the two vice presidents claimed
they were owed.
   Morash was accused of violating a state law that applies
specifically to employers who do not pay wages to workers,
including vacation benefits.
   Such laws are preempted by ERISA, the Massachusetts court ruled.
   Law enforcement officials Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maine,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming urged the high court to review the
case.
   They said if courts in other states follow Masschusetts' lead
and bar enforcement of similar laws, it will ``dramatically reduce
the protection that workers now receive because federal law and
enforcement mechanisms do not provide sufficient remedies for
wrongfully denied vacation pay.''
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Morash, 88-32.

   City and federal investigators plan
laboratory tests in an effort to determine the origin of a pipe
bomb that exploded, killing a 9-year-old boy and injuring five
other children.
   ``It was a terrible situation,'' said fire department Lt. R.C.
Swan. ``It was quite an explosion.''
   Max Herrera was killed and his brother, sister and three
neighbor children were injured Sunday evening when the 6- to
8-inch-long bomb they believed was a ``big firecracker'' exploded.
   Fire Capt. Roy Knight said the children may have found the bomb
along their street. But the dead boy's older sister, Rosie
Arredonda, 24, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that ``some kid
gave Max the bomb. Max lit it and it went up.''
   ``We've heard the kids were passing it around, trying to light
it with matches,'' said Fire Department District Chief David Carr.
``They had it in their hands. Whether they lit it or not, we don't
know. ... They were playing with it, but we can't be sure at this
time where it came from.''
   In spite of the strength of the blast that threw debris up to
150 feet away, nearly 75 percent of the bomb remained intact.
   ``We've got the whole (bomb),'' said Lou Iliano, agent of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``There's quite a
bit of physical evidence. I was surprised at how much there was
left.''
   Shannon Hartigan, a pediatric nurse, was among the first on the
scene.
   ``I saw that little boy,'' Ms. Hartigan said of Max. ``I was
going to help him and I couldn't, of course, because there was
nothing to do to help.''
   She said the five injured children were coherent at the scene.
``All they kept asking was `Are we going to die?''', Ms. Hartigan
said.
   Two of the injured children were treated and released. One was
in fair condition after surgery to repair broken bones, one was in
serious condition after surgery for facial and eye injuries, and
one was in fair condition with head injuries, hospital officials
said.

<HEAD>WPPSS Bond Buyers Lose Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by
investors who lost money in the largest municipal bond default in
U.S. history, stemming from a doomed nuclear power project in
Washington state.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' let stand a ruling that dismissed some key investor
claims triggered by the $2.25 billion default.
   The justices also rejected an appeal by the bond counsel in the
case seeking additional legal protection.
   Investors, ranging from individuals to major corporations, sued
the Washington Public Power Supply System and numerous others in
1984.
   The Washington State Supreme Court last year upheld a state law
that retroactively expanded protection for cities and utilities
against some bondholder claims.
   That ruling made it more difficult for investors to recover
their losses by suing public agencies. But at the same time the
state court permitted other investor claims to proceed to trial.
   A trial began last month in Tucson, Ariz., in which more than
24,000 bond buyers are charging fraud by 19 defendants _ 16
utilities, two engineering firms and a financial adviser. The
defendants allegedly withheld crucial information from investors
who bought bonds to finance construction of two nuclear power
plants.
   The appeal acted on today challenged portions of the 1987
Washington Supreme Court decision upholding state law protections
for cities and utilities. The law is aimed at shielding the public
agencies, and ultimately their electricity customers, from being
sued for alleged negligence.
   The law does not protect the agencies from being sued for fraud,
and those allegations are being aired in the Tucson trial.
   The state court said protecting the agencies from being sued for
negligence does not interfere unlawfully with interstate commerce,
does not violate investors' due process rights and does not
illegally impair any contractual agreement between bondholders and
issuers of the securities.
   The nation's highest court in 1985 rejected an earlier bid by
investors to ease recovery of their losses.
   All told, investors say they have lost $7 billion _ the $2.25
billion in bonds plus interest they would have received if there
had been no default.
   The bonds were to finance two proposed WPPSS nuclear plants to
meet an anticipated increase in power needs in the Northwest. But
facilities already built by the mid-1970s proved adequate to supply
the region and construction of the two new plants was abandoned in
1982. That triggered the bond default.
   Eighty-eight cities, utilities and electrical cooperatives in
the Northwest took part in agreements to build the two plants.
   In a companion case acted on today, the bond counsel firm of
Wood Dawson Smith & Hellman appealed for greater protection from
being sued. The firm said it should be given the same protection
afforded the public agencies that issued the bonds.
   The cases acted on today are American Express vs. WPPSS,
87-1889, Haberman vs. WPPSS, 87-1897, and Wood Dawson vs. Haberman,
87-2109.

Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a Pennsylvania couple criminally convicted in their young son's
death for trying to heal him through prayer rather than seeking
medical care.
   The court, without comment, let stand William and Linda
Barnhart's convictions for manslughter and endangering the welfare
of a child stemming from the 1981 death of their 2-year-old son,
Justin.
   The Barnharts, members of a fundamentalist religion who live in
Beaver Valley, Pa., received probationary sentences.
   Their appeal asked how the Barnharts could be held criminally
liable ``for putting their faith in God with the reasonable
expectation that the First Amendment would protect them?''
   The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees religious freedom.
   A state appeals court, in upholding the convictions, said there
is ``no easy answer'' in the Barnharts' case.
   In the late spring of 1981, the Barnharts detected a small lump
in Justin's abdomen. The lump grew over the summer, and by his
death on Sept. 10 Justin's abdomen had become quite large and
distended.
   An autopsy ordered by the Cambria County coroner indicated that
Justin's death was caused by a Wilm's tumor that weighed nearly
five pounds.
   The tumor's presence, and its effect on Justin's organs,
resulted in his death by starvation.
   The Barnharts made Justin's condition known to fellow members of
the Faith Tabernacle Congregation, who joined in prayer for him.
The child's abdomen was anointed with oil by the church's pastor.
   The appeals court, noting that three generations of the
Barnharts' family have adhered to the church's
healing-through-prayer beliefs, said, ``The question becomes one of
degree: to what extent may a parent impose these beliefs on a minor
child?''
   It concluded: ``Faced with a condition which threatened their
child's life, the parents had no choice but to seek medical help.''
   The appeals court, however, said its upholding the criminal
convictions was not meant to denigrate the Barnharts' religious
beliefs.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear the Barnharts'
appeal last Jan. 14.
   In seeking help from the nation's highes court, the Barnharts'
appeal said, ``A significant number of Americans adhere to the
(same) religious principles, and they along with the (Barnharts)
look to this court for guidance.''
   The case is Barnhart vs. Pennsyvlania, 87-1722.

<HEAD>Court Kills Lawsuit Against Penthouse by Four Rhode Island
Schoolgirls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today killed a $7.5 million
lawsuit against Penthouse magazine by four Warwick, R.I.,
schoolgirls and their parents.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the 1986
publication of a photograph of the four girls and an accompanying
headline did not amount to libel or intentional infliction of
emotional distress.
   In the autumn of 1985, the principal of Warwick's Oakland Beach
Elementary School decided to segregate the sexes during recess
periods because of fighting between boys and girls.
   In its reporting of the trouble, the Providence Journal-Bulletin
published a photograph showing Leslie Fudge, Jennifer Ann Merritt,
Tina Marie Oliver and Renee Vincentbs-down sign to
show their disapproval of the principal's decision.
   A story and the photo of the four girl giving the thums, who ranged
in age from
8 to 12, were distributed nationwide by The Associated Press.
   The April 1986 issue of Penthouse published the photograph over
a headline that read ``Little Amazons Attack Boys.''
   In a brief article, the school principal was quoted as saying
the recess segregation was enforced to protect the school's boys
from its girls.
   ``They kick them in the shins, pull their hair and kick them ...
well, in various places,'' the principal was quoe issuance of the original
permit, those
factors would be completely outweighed in this case by the doctrine
that reasonable diligence would have readily uncovered'' the
correct limitations, the state court said.
   It also rejected arguments by Parkview Associates that the
city's order to reduce the building size is an unconstitutional
taking of property without due process.
   That issue cannot be addressed now because the builders have not
applied for a zoning variance, the state court said.
   Lawyers for Parkview Associates said it is the victim of
``grotesque mistreatment,'' stuck with a vacant building and
mounting losses while unable to get any income from the property.
   The case is Parkview Associates vs. New York City, 87-1837.

   The Supreme Court today refused to force an
insurance company to help pay for cleaning up dioxin, a highly
toxic chemical, disposed of in various Missouri locations in the
early 1970s.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that an
insurance policy held by the chemical firm responsible for the
pollution did not make the insurance company liable for clean-up
costs.
   Dioxin has been linked to cancer, liver and immune system
disorders and a serious skin condition called chloracne.
   In 1982, the federal government bought out homes and property in
Times Beach, Mo., because of dioxin contamination. What was once a
town of 2,240 residents ceased to exist in 1985 when Times Beach's
aldermen voted to disincorporate the town.
   In the appeal acted on today, Missouri Attorney General William
A. Webster said his state faces spending tens of millions of
dollars to clean up the dioxin.
   ``As of November 1986, Missouri already had spent nearly $3
million to clean up the dioxin contamination ... and clean-up is
ongoing,'' Webster said. ``The state's projected share of the cost
to clean up ... primary dioxin-contaminated sites in Missouri is
$20 million.''
   The dioxin, a waste product from a Verona, Mo., plant owned by
the now-defunct ortheastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Co.
(NEPACCO), was disposed of in various ways.
   In 1971, NEPACCO arranged to dispose of at least 85 55-gallon
drums of wastes in a trench near a Verona farm.
   In 1971 and 1972, dioxin-contaminated wastes from the Verona
plant were spread on the Bubbling Springs Stables in Fenton, Mo.,
and roads in Times Beach to control dust.
   From 1970 to 1972, NEPACCO was insured by Continental Insurance
Companies. Its policy required Continental to pay ``all sums which
the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages...''
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency sued NEPACCO in
1982, alleging that it had caused ``endangerment to health and the
environment.''
   The chemical firm was held liable for certain clean-up costs.
   Missouri sued NEPACCO in 1983 in an effort to recover other
clean-up costs, sparking Continental to sue NEPACCO to protect
itself against insurance claims.
   The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Feb. 26
that the word ``damages'' in the NEPACCO insurance policy did not
apply to clean-up costs, a form of ``equitable relief.''
   The case is Missouri vs. Continental Insurance, 87-1953.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact $48 Million Judgment Awarded TWA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today left intact a $48.3
million judgment awarded Trans World Airlines against a company
founded by the late billionaire Howard Hughes.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Summa Corp.
and William R. Lummis, administrator of the Hughes estate, that the
award should be thrown out.
   The Delaware Supreme Court upheld the award last April 4 in a
case that began in 1962.
   Summa Corp., formerly called Hughes Tool Co. or Toolco, owned 78
percent of TWA stock when Toolco was sued by other TWA shareholders.
   The minority shareholders said TWA was denied an opportunity to
be competitive and profitable because Toolco refused to allow the
airline to purchase its own jets in the 1950s. TWA was forced to
lease jets and buy some from Toolco, the suit said.
   ``For reasons clearly attributable to the eccentric or
idiosyncratic business methods of Howard Hughes, TWA was unable to
establish a jet fleet as quickly as its competitors,'' the Delaware
Supreme Court ruled.
   It upheld a lower court ruling that awarded TWA more than $17.2
million plus interest of about $31.1 million.
   Hughes began acquiring TWA stock in 1939 and increased his
holdings to 78 percent by 1958.
   The Civil Aeronautics Board, which was interested in Toolco's
experimental work in developing airplane parts for the military,
approved the acquisition of TWA.
   The nation's highest court ruled in 1973 that Toolco did not
violate federal antitrust laws when buying up TWA stock.
   But the TWA minority shareholders then sued in state court in
Delaware, charging Toolco with violating state corporation laws
that require companies to seek the best interest of stockholders.
   After more than a decade of pre-trial maneuvering, a state court
found Toolco violated its fiduciary duty to TWA.
   The Delaware Supreme Court, in upholding the verdict, said the
1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision did not give Toolco ``blanket
immunity'' from being sued.
   The state Supreme Court said, ``As a whole, Toolco acted for its
sole benefit at the expense of its fiduciary duties to TWA's
minority shareholders.''
   The state court said Toolco, through the lease and sale of
planes to TWA, ``accrued substantial profits, reportable as capital
gains, as well as other tax benefits. Furthermore, Toolco
structured the transactions to minimize its exposure to risk at the
expense of TWA's profits. Such conduct hardly comports with basic
concepts of fair dealing.''
   The state court also rejected Toolco's argument that it delayed
TWA's acquisition of jets in the 1950s because it was waiting for
jets with true trans-Atlantic capability.
   Other airlines were buying the jets for their trans-Atlantic
routes until the later models were available, the state court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Summa Corp. said the Delaware
court ruling is a threat to ``the supremacy of federal statutes and
(federal) agency orders.''
   The case is Summa Corp. vs. TWA, 88-149.

<HEAD>Drugs, Kiddie Porn, Parental Leave Still on Congressional Agenda</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts 2 grafs on textile bill after 8th graf pvs, ``What

   Before the 100th Congress shuts down, its
members likely will be fighting old battles against illegal drugs
and child pornography, and new ones over child care and mandatory
parental leave from work.
   Congress also may approve legislation to apply the first-ever
anti-lobbying restrictions on former members of Congress, and the
House could change its rules to extend civil rights protections to
its own employees.
   With the possibility of Congress adjourning for the year this
week, there's no guarantee that any controversial measures will
pass. But many often do in the last-minute frenzy that usually
accompanies the end of a congressional session.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said a hybrid
pornography-child care-parental leave bill is less important than
the anti-drug measure.
   ``If you asked the American people which is more important, the
drug bill would be on everybody's list,'' he said Friday.
   The social issues in the parental leave bill have ``yet to be
defined'' by the presidential candidates, Dole said, adding, ``It
seems to me these issues ought to be looked at in the full light of
day in 1989.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., agreed ``the
drug bill is exceedingly important,'' but said the other three
issues should be approved before lawmakers leave.
   ``What could be more important than these?'' he said. Contending
that the presidential campaign should not influence Congress, Byrd
said, ``Let us remove them from the national debate. Let's enact
them now. The responsibility is ours. Why put it off so the
presidential and vice presidential candidates can debate who is
more pro-family.''
   The House has scheduled a vote, probably Tuesday, on overriding
President Reagan's veto of the Textile and Apparel Trade Act. The
legislation would limit the growth of textile and apparel imports
to 1 percent per year, and hold footwear imports to 1986 levels.
   Countries that increase their purchases of U.S. agricultural
goods could be given preference in the awarding of the quotas.
Senate Democratic leaders have not announced their plans on an
override.
   The House on Sept. 22 voted 375-30 for its version of the
anti-drug bill, which authorizes some $2 billion in new spending
and includes provisions to punish recreational users and murderers
alike.
   But the legislation includes a number of get-tough provisions
that may face court challenges, and there's no telling whether the
Senate will accept them. If the Senate does approve a bill, the two
houses could get bogged down in conference.
   The Senate bill will have a similar price tag, but includes a
number of differences. It does not include House provisions for
strong civil fines against drug users; the death penalty for those
who kill during drug-related crimes; and language to admit evidence
in federal court that was seized illegally by officers acting in
``good faith.''
   The parental leave component of the Senate legislation would
require businesses with more than 50 employees to give workers at
least 10 weeks of leave to cope with a newborn, newly adopted or
seriously ill child or a worker's own serious illness.
   Some of the most adamant opponents of the leave measure added it
last week to a bill strengthening laws and penalties against child
pornography and obscenity.
   The child care section would be modeled on the Act for Better
Child Care Services, a Democratic initiative centered on subsidies
to help families pay for day care.
   The anti-lobbying measure not only would place restrictions on
recently retired members of Congress, but on former presidents and
vice presidents.
   It also would expand current lobbying restrictions on former
executive branch officials.
   The Senate already has approved its own set lobbying
prohibitions for those who quit the executive branch or leave
Congress. Both measures are aimed at those who leave the government
and then immediately lobby their former colleagues _ usually on
issues with which they were involved.
   The House also is slated to vote on a proposed rules change to
extend civil rights protections to all employees of the House. The
measure would establish an internal enforcement process.
   The rule would provide all House employees and job applicants
with protection against discrimination based on race, color,
national origin, religion, sex, handicap or age. The language is
patterned after federal civil rights law.
   The Senate is preparing to consider a bill that would make
hundreds of changes and create some protections for taxpayers
involved in IRS disputes.
   Unlike most of the other tax bills of the 1980s, there is little
in this legislation to draw the concern of the average family. Most
of the changes are intended to clear up ambiguities or correct
errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. But there are tidbits for some
farmers, oil drillers, free-lance writers, first-time homebuyers,
banks and workers who receive educational assistance from their
employers.
   Appearing doomed as the session headed toward an end were Clean
Air Act revisions that advocates say would step up the nation's
battle against urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals.
   Attempts by George Mitchell, D-Maine, to put together a
consensus in the Senate were far from successful last week, with
deep regional divisions over acid rain provisions the main
stumbling block.

<HEAD>Mickey Spillane's Ex-Wife Fails to Alter Nevada Divorce Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Mickey Spillane's ex-wife failed today
in a Supreme Court bid to alter her divorce settlement.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Nevada court decisions
dismissing Sherri Spillane's lawsuit contesting the $18,000
settlement she received in 1983 from Spillane, creator of the
fictional detective Mike Hammer.
   The couple had been married in California in 1964, but according
to court records they did not live together after 1979. During that
time, Spillane resided in Murrell's Inlet, S.C., and his wife lived
in California.
   Spillane, whose books have sold more than a million copies
around the world, for years has been a familiar figure in
television beer commercials.
   Sherri Spillane, who appeared on the covers of several of
Spillane's books, tried to have their divorce settlement altered in
1985. She contended, among other things, that Spillane fraudulently
concealed community property assets.
   One state judge noted that the former Mrs. Spillane obtained a
marriage license to marry Michael Standing 20 minutes after her
divorce from Spillane was final.
   The judge said that while still married to Spillane, Sherri
Spillane had a longterm love affair with Standing.
   ``The court will not pass judgment on morality, but such actions
certainly are not those of a caring, faithful, loving spouse,'' the
state judge said.
   The Nevada Supreme Court threw out the lawsuit last year.
   The case is Spillane vs. Spillane, 88-45.

<HEAD>Religious Group Must Pay Arkansas Sales Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial religious group seeking to
avoid paying an Arkansas state sales tax on goods and services it
furnishes to members lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the Alamo
Foundation must pay the taxes on meals, clothing, goods and
services provided to its members, who in turn work for the
foundation.
   The foundation _ also based in California _ runs a restaurant, a
grocery store, two service stations, a clothing store and an auto
repair shop in Arkansas. The businesses are run for profit, and
foundation members _ also called associates _ work there without
receiving salaries.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled last March that the members are
``paid'' by having their material needs met by the foundation.
   For example, the state court said, the Alamo Restaurant had
total sales of $2.3 million from Sept. 1, 1977 through Aug. 31,
1980. During that period, $1.4 million worth of food was sold to
the general public and the balance was consumed by Alamo members
and their families.
   The state court said that the food was transferred to the
members in exchange for their work, and therefore the foundation
must pay taxes on the transfers.
   ``The simple fact that the Alamo Foundation is a religious and
charitable organizae split between the two contending sponsors.
   The party commission also was awarded the sponsorship of the
debate this Wednesday in Omaha, Neb., between Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and his Republican
counterpart, Dan Quayle.
   The league had already signed contracts for a hall in Los
Angeles and made other arrangments for the second Bush-Dukakis
debate.
   But knowledgeable sources said there was no agreement about the
stage, podiums or panel of questioners for the second debate, and
that the campaigns had not discussed final arrangements with the
league by late last week.

   The Supreme Court today turned away an appeal
accusing defeated high court nominee Robert H. Bork of improperly
participating in a case just before he quit as a federal judge.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Bork's
failure to disqualify himself from a libel case violated the
conservative Liberty Lobby group's due-process rights.
   Liberty Lobby sued The Wall Street Journal for $50 million over
a 1984 article and a 1985 column that appeared in the newspaper.
   The column was written by Suzanne Garment, a Journal writer
whose husband, Leonard Garment, is a longtime friend of Bork's.
   Garment, a Washington lawyer, served as Bork's chief spokesman
during an unsuccessful campaign to win Senate confirmation of
Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.
   The Senate rejected Bork by a 58-42 vote last October.
   Bork's participation in the Liberty Lobby case was challenged
because of his relationship with the Garments.
   In both the article and column, Liberty Lobby was referred to as
``anti-Semitic'' and was linked to books authored by an advocate of
racial betterment through genetic selection.
   Although Liberty Lobby admits to being an anti-Zionist
organization it denies being anti-Semitic. The lawsuit also denied
any links with the author's works.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, whose participation
in the case also was challenged, dismissed the lawsuit in 1986.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
upheld the libel suit's dismissal last Feb. 5, in an opinion
written by Bork.
   Bork quit the federal bench that same day.
   In his opinion for the appellate panel, Bork said, ``We tend to
agree with the district court that if the term `anti-Semitic' has a
core factual meaning, then the truth of the description was proved
here.''
   The appeals court also rejected Liberty Lobby's denial of a link
to the mentioned books, published by Noontide Press in Torrance,
Calif.
   ``The record evidence that both (group treasurer Willis Carto)
and Liberty Lobby exercise substantial financial and editorial
control over the publishing activities of Noontide is, in our view,
compelling,'' Bork wrote.
   The full court of appeals last Feb. 25 denied Liberty Lobby's
request to have its lawsuit revived and Bork disqualified.
   The case is Liberty Lobby vs. Dow Jones & Co., 87-2053.

   NOTE: This breakdown counts the vacant seats in the 3rd District
in New Jersey and the 19th District in New York as Democratic and
the 2nd District in Tennessee as Republican. James J. Howard's
death in March left the New Jersey seat vacant, while John J.
Duncan's death in June left the Tennessee seat vacant. The New York
seat is vacant after the resignation of Mario Biaggi.
   The trend line gives the anticipated new party division for the
U.S. House. It is calculated by adding the number of races which
each party has won or is leading.

<TEXT>
   A man with two vials of crack and a record of
arrests for drug possession was doused with a flammable liquid and
fatally burned on a sidewalk near Madison Square Garden, police
said.
   The man, who identified himself as Michael Howard and said his
nickname was ``Scandalous Mike,'' died Sunday morning at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, about 10 hours after the attack
Saturday evening.
   Capt. William K. Roe said nobody had been arrested and police
did not have a motive for the attack. Howard, who police records
said was 29, had three arrests for drug possession on his record
but none for selling.
   ``It's narcotics-related to the extent that the man had
narcotics on his person, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's
why he was killed in this manner,'' Roe said Sunday.
   Howard had two crack vials in his mouth, ``which is where people
who sell crack keep it,'' he said.
   ``So the indications are that it is a possible narcotics dealer
dealing crack in the area, although he has never been arrested for
selling,'' Roe said.
   Detective Joseph McConville, a police spokesman, said three or
four men approached Howard from behind, poured a liquid over him
and ignited him.
   Howard managed to cross the street before collapsing. He who
told police, ``You know me, I'm Scandalous Mike,'' as he was
removed from the scene. He also indicated that he knew who his
assailants were.
   He died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center from
second-and third-degree burns over 98 percent of his body, said
Solomon Torres, a hospital administrator.
   His fingers were so badly burned that it was difficult to
confirm his identity through fingerprints, Roe said.
   Amtrak police at Penn Station said they were familiar with
``Scandalous Mike,'' Roe said. Two of the man's three
drug-possession arrests took place at the station, where many
homeless and street people congregate.

   The wife of soul singer James Brown has
been convicted of a drug charge and fined $330, a court official
said today.
   Adrienne Brown, 38, of Aiken, S.C., appeared in Merrimack
District Court on Friday on a charge of possession of the drug PCP
based on lab tests on the contents of a plastic container. The
container was confiscated last May when a fire broke out in a
Bedford hotel where she and her husband were staying.
   She also was charged with arson and criminal mischief following
the May 10 fire. Mrs. Brown said she wasn't in the hotel room when
the fire began.
   The Hillsborough County attorney declined to seek indictments on
the fire-related charges.
   Mrs. Brown and her husband were in New Hampshire for a concert
performance.
   Last month, in Augusta, Ga., Mrs. Brown withdrew a guilty plea
to two drug charges stemming from arrests in April and May.

<HEAD>Court Upholds More Federal Control of Water in National Parks in
California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a decision
giving the federal government greater water rights in its
management of national forests in California.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by California
officials that the federal government does not have the same water
rights, under state law, as private landowners.
   In a 1976 case involving water rights for Hallett Creek in
Lassen County, the U.S. Forest Service claimed two kinds of rights
for Plumas National Forest lands:
   _A ``reserved'' right under federal law for primary purposes
such as firefighting and road watering during timber harvests.
   _A ``riparian'' right under California law for secondary
purposes, including ``wildlife enhancement.''
   The state Water Resources Control Board upheld the federal
government's claim for a reserved right but denied its claim for a
riparian right _ one enjoyed by private landowners whose property
is touched by a body of water.
   The 1976 ruling meant the Forest Service was entitled to divert
and use 95,000 gallons of Hallett Creek water each year. It had
sought an additional 547,000 gallons each year for wildlife
enhancement.
   Joined by the Sierra Club, the federal government appealed the
state board ruling.
   California courts, including the state Supreme Court last Feb.
18, ruled for the federal government.
   California officials then sought the Supreme Court's help in the
appeal acted on today. That appeal was supported in a
``friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by eight other states:
Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Washington and Wyoming.
   The case is California vs. U.S., 87-2010.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, beginning its new term
today, announced it will expand its study of drug testing in the
workplace, agreeing to decide whether a railroad may require
workers to take the tests routinely.
   The court began its 1988-1989 term in a whirl of activity,
acting on about 1,000 cases in its first day. Before the term ends,
it is expected to hand down important decisions on such other
issues as civil rights, affirmative action and the death penalty.
   In today's drug-testing case, the justices said they will review
a ruling that barred the Consolidated Rail Corporation, or Conrail,
from imposing the tests without permitting collective bargaining
over the issue.
   The court announced earlier this year that it would review two
other drug-testing cases _ one involving railway workers and the
other the U.S. Customs Service.
   In the earlier railway case, the justices will decide whether
constitutional privacy rights of workers are violated by federal
regulations requiring blood and urine tests for those involved in
serious train accidents.
   The Customs Services tests are conducted for those seeking drug
enforcement jobs.
   Today's action significantly expands the scope of the court's
review by including a case in which a private company _ rather than
the government _ is adopting mandatory drug tests.
   All three cases will be decided in the court's new term, which
will conclude by July.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether displays of a Christmas nativity
scene and a menorah, symbolizing the Jewish holiday of Chanukah,
should be allowed at two government buildings in Pittsburgh.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that each display
violated the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   _ Agreed to decide whether states may be sued in federal court
by parents seeking to enforce a law aimed at assuring adequate
education for handicapped children.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Pennsylvania
officials ordered to pay a year's private school tuition for a
student with a learning disability.
   _ Rejected the appeal of a Pennsylvania couple criminally
convicted in their young son's death for trying to heal him through
prayer rather than seeking medical care.
   The court, without comment, let stand William and Linda
Barnhart's convictions for manslaughter and endangering the welfare
of a child stemming from the 1981 death of their 2-year-old son,
Justin.
   _ Left intact a $48.3 million judgment awarded Trans World
Airlines against a company founded by the late billionaire Howard
Hughes.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Summa Corp.
and William R. Lunnis, administrator of the Hughes estate, that the
award should be thrown out.
   _ Agreed to decide whether the federal government may continue
to bar newspapers from carrying advertisements for privately run
lotteries and other games of chance.
   The justices said they will study a Minnesota Newspaper
Association challenge to a postal law effectively prohibiting such
advertising.
   _ Agreed to decide whether communities may seek to protect young
teen-agers by barring anyone over 18 from dance halls or other
establishments catering to minors.
   The court said it will consider reinstating a Dallas ordinance
that licensed certain dance halls on the condition only teens 14 to
18 and their parents or guardians be admitted as patrons.
   _ Refused to force an insurance company to help pay for cleaning
up dioxin, a highly toxic chemical, disposed of in various Missouri
locations in the early 1970s.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that an
insurance policy held by the chemical firm responsible for the
pollution did not make the insurance company liable for clean-up
costs.
   _ Agreed to consider the authority of states to deny
unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath.
   The court said it will decide whether Illinois officials
lawfully refused to pay benefits to a man whose refusal to work was
not based on the doctrine of any established religious body.
   In the Conrail case, the railroad announced in February 1987
that it unilaterally would check for drugs as part of a urinalysis
administered periodically to workers and also when they returned to
work after an absence.
   The railway said the need for the tests were manified by an
accident at Chase, Md., on Jan. 4, 1987, in which an Amtrak
passenger train collided with Conrail locomotives, killing 16 and
injuring 174. The Conrail engineer and brakeman subsequently were
found to have been using marijuana.
   Conrail had been conducting urine tests since 1976 as part of
periodic physical examinations administered to workers at intervals
varying between one and three years depending on the employee's age
and job classification. But those tests were aimed at discovering
whether a worker, for example, had diabetes and not whether the
employee was using drugs.
   Railway labor unions said adding the drug screening component to
the urinalysis violated the federal Railway Labor Act.
   The unions said the expanded tests were a major change in
working conditions and must be submitted to collective bargaining.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia agreed
with the unions.
   ``Conrail's addition of drug screening to the urinalysis
examination of employees as to whom Conrail has no particularized
suspicion of drug use changes the terms and conditions governing
the employment relationships,'' the appeals court said. ``It
therefore constitutes a major dispute which Conrail cannot impose
unilaterally.''
   The appeals court noted that drug and alochol abuse is a major
problem for the transportation industry.
   It cited studies estimating 25 percent of railroad workers drink
on duty and showing that alcohol and other drugs were responsible
for 37 deaths, 80 injuries and $34 million in property damage
between 1975 and 1985.
   But dealing with the problem must be accomplished at the
bargaining table, the appeals court said.
   The drug-testing case is Conrail vs. Railway Labor Executives
Association, 88-1.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Arguments Power Agency Policy Costs Californians
Billions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away arguments
that the policies of the Bonneville Power Administration are
costing electricity consumers in California billions of dollars.
   The justices, without comment, decided not to order changes in
the way the BPA distributes hydroelectric power throughout the
Pacific Northwest and California.
   The BPA, an independent, self-financed marketer of electric
power within the federal Department of Energy, sells electricity
generated by 31 federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. It also
operates a system of electric power transmission lines.
   The legal controversy acted on today involves the transmission
line system, which is called the Pacific Northwest-Pacific
Southwest Intertie.
   Congress established the system in the late 1960s in order for
the Pacific Northwest and Pacific Southwest to exchange power when
one region has a surplus supply and the other region has a heavy
demand.
   BPA owns and operates most of the Intertie transmission lines
north of the Oregon-California border. Lines south of that boundary
are owned by several California utilities.
   BPA policies on distribution of power over the transmission
lines were challenged in a lawsuit by the two California state
agencies, the Public Utilities Commission and the Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission.
   The agencies contended that the BPA access policies illegally
excluded low-cost energy generated in the Pacific Northwest and
Canada from the transmission system. The state agencies said
lower-cost energy thus was prevented from reaching California
consumers.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the BPA last
November.
   In seeking the Supreme Court's help, lawyers for the California
agencies said the transmission line access policy ``will produce a
transfer of wealth between regions of the United States on the
order of billions of dollars.''
   Reagan administration lawyers urged the justices to reject the
appeals.
   The cases are California Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission vs. BPA, 87-1835, and California PUC vs.
BPA, 87-1836.

<HEAD>Kinnock Defeats Party Leftists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with defeat of bid to block policy,
other details. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `In a ballot...'
^By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock, who crushed a left-wing attempt to unseat him as his
party's leader, today defeated a bid to block apolicy review that
supports the role of private enterprise.
   Kinnock kicked off the party's annual weeklong convention Sunday
night by crushing a challenge for his job by the doyen of the party
left, former Cabinet minister Tony Benn.
   The more than 1,000 conference delegates today rejected the
attempt to kill the policy review _ which would push the socialists
toward the center _ by a vote of more than 10-to-1.
   Kinnock ordered the review after Labor's third successive
election defeat by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
1987.
   In a break with traditional party ideology, the review abandons
a previous commitment to renationalize all the industries sold by
Mrs. Thatcher since she came to power in 1979. In addition, it
drops some of the left wing's favorite causes by partially
accepting Mrs. Thatcher's curbs on labor unions.
   A series of left-wing speakers accused Kinnock of putting
forward what one called ``a pompous document which rejects
socialism.''
   In a ballot at the start of the conference Sunday evening,
Kinnock, 46, overwhelmingly defeated his challenger, Tony Benn, 63.
Kinnock appeared certain to use the victory as a new mandate to
push the party toward the center.
   Kinnock received 88 percent of the votes of an electoral college
composed of labor union leaders, legislators and local constituency
parties. Benn has pledged to continue trying to stop what he calls
the ``virtual repudiation of socialism'' at the Blackpool
conference.
   The final stages of the policy review will be presented to the
party's annual conference next year, along with the documents
debated today.
   In another vote Sunday, Kinnock's deputy Roy Hattersley also
defeated on the first ballot with a two-thirds majority a bid to
unseat him by two leftists, John Prescott and Eric Heffer.
   Kinnock hailed the votes as a ``great honor and a great trust.''
   ``It imposes a great duty, too,'' said Kinnock. ``We want to use
this great victory to secure a greater victory at the next general
election.''
   Benn has scheduled a series of fringe meetings through the
weeklong conference in this northeast England resort to press home
his argument that Kinnock, in the hope of averting another election
defeat, has ditched Labor's fundamental policies. These include a
commitment, at least on paper, for the government to control all
means of ownership and production.
   Kinnock had been expected to defeat Benn's challenge by a wide
margin. In addition to getting virtually unanimous backing from the
labor union leaders, who comprise 40 percent of the electoral
college, he also received majority support from the often hostile
Labor constitutency parties.
   All but 35 of the party's 228 parliamentary legislators voted
for Kinnock.
   Latest opinion polls show Labor narrowing its big gap with the
ruling Conservatives but still trailing them by between 9 and 5
points, despite a fall in the Conservatives' popularity.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Attorney Fee Issue in Texas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether those who win partial victories in civil rights lawsuits _
losing on the central issue _ are entitled to recover their
attorneys' fees.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by school teachers in
Texas who challenged anti-union regulations.
   The regulations, adopted by the Garland Independent School
District, barred teacher union representatives from visiting
schools during regular school hours or using school public address
systems or other communications facilities.
   The rules also prohibited private conversations among teachers
regarding the employee organizations and also barred any teacher
from using a school's internal mail system or bulletin board to
discuss union activities.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the regulations
affecting union representatives. But the appeals court said it
violates the free-speech and free-association rights of teachers to
ban private conversations or prevent them from using the mail or
bulletin board facilities.
   The appeals court ruled in February that the Texas State
Teachers Association and the Garland Education Association, which
filed the suit, are not entitled to be reimbursed for attorneys'
fees.
   Federal civil rights laws provide that ``the prevailing party''
in such cases is entitled to reimbursement. The idea is to provide
an incentive for lawyers to represent civil rights plaintiffs, who
frequently have limited financial resources and find it difficult
to get legal representation.
   At issue in the case acted on today is what constitutes a
prevailing party.
   The 5th Circuit court said the teacher unions ``did not succeed
on the central issue of their suit and did not obtain the primary
relief sought. The main thrust of this lawsuit was (their) attempt
to open up Garland Independent School District campuses during
school hours to outside representatives of employee organizations.
(They) failed in this attempt.''
   The appeals court acknowledged that the teachers prevailed ``on
significant secondary issues.''
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, the teacher groups said there
is confusion among federal appeals courts over the ``prevailing
party'' issue and they asked the justices to provide clear
guidelines.
   The case is Texas State Teachers Association vs. Garland
Independent School District, 87-1759.

   Gunmen killed a Roman Catholic
man in his home Monday, and the extremist group that claimed
responsibility said the man was slain because he was a police
informer.
   But the family of Henry McNamee, 33, denied he was an informer,
and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
refused comment.
   The Irish People's Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for McNamee's death in a statement to news media.
   The organization is a splinter group of the Irish National
Liberation Army, itself an extremist offshoot of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   Police said gunmen burst into a west Belfast home just before 3
a.m. and shot McNamee at close range before escaping in a hijacked
car. The car was later recovered nearby, police said.
   ``My brother is innocent of that accusation (of being an
informant),'' said Joe McNamee. ``It is as simple as that.''
   ``He has been in jail before due to the circumstances and the
situation in Northern Ireland but he was not an informer.''
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly
Catholic Irish Republic.
   In south Belfast, four children aged 1 to 12 and their
grandmother escaped injury Monday when several gunmen fired about
20 shots into their house, police said. They said they were not
aware of any motive for the attack.

   President Reagan today put in a plug for the
forthcoming 500th anniversary celebration of Christopher Columbus'
voyage to America, but confessed he has a little trouble with the
observance's name.
   ``It's called the quincentenary, and it may take another 500
years before I can say that easily,'' Reagan told a crowd in the
White House East Room as he signed a proclamation declaring Oct. 10
as Columbus Day.
   Later in his remarks, the president stumbled over the word,
referring to the`` Christopher Columbus Quincentenni - centenary
Commission'' that he appointed to make plans for the 1992
observance.
   Next time he came to the word, he paused, grinned, and got it
right: ``Quincentenary.''
   Whatever you call it, said Reagan, ``it will be a time when
Americans from all backgrounds look back on all that voyage has
meant to mankind over the past half millenium.''

<TEXT>
   A one-time top aide to Aerican Samoa's former
non-voting delegate to Congress received a three-month prison term
Monday for masterminding a payroll padding scheme that netted
$130,920.
   Matthew Iuli, who was chief aide to former Del. Fofo I.F. Sunia,
was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris on his guilty
pleas to conspiring to defraud the government and filing a false
payroll claim.
   Sunia, 51, a Democrat who had represented American Samoa since
1981, resigned his seat after pleading guilty Aug. 3 to a single
conspiracy charge. He could receive a five-year prison term and a
$250,000 fine when sentenced Tuesday by Harris.
   The judge rejected a defense request _ unopposed by prosecutors
_ that Iuli be placed on probation because he had not personally
benefited from the scheme and had fully cooperated with prosecutors.
   ``I think that probation is not appropriate in your case,''
Harris said, noting the extent of the crime.
   ``A period of incarceration is not necessary to deter you or
rehabilitate you, but to deter others,'' Harris said. ``There are
an awful lot of other offices up on Capitol Hill.''
   Iuli could have received two five-year sentences.
   As part of his guilty plea, Iuli agreed to pay the government
$25,000 as restitution and has already made a $10,000 payment,
defense lawyer Richard Saltsman told Harris.
   Both Andary and Saltsman noted that Iuli did not personally
benefit from the scheme, under which he arranged for paychecks to
be issued to Samoans who were falsely listed as working for Sunia.
   Between February 1983 and August 1986, 78 paychecks worth
$130,920 were issued by the government as a result of false payroll
vouchers submitted by Sunia's office, according to court papers.

<HEAD>More Than 1,000 Prisoners Released Under Amnesty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Monday released more
than 1,000 prisoners, including 52 political offenders, under a
special amnesty marking South Korea's National Foundation Day, a
major national holiday.
   Opposition parties, who have demanded the release of ``all
political prisoners,'' criticized the amnesty. Opposition leader
Kim Dae-jung said his party, along with other opposition parties,
would try to enact a special law to win the release of other
``prisoners of conscience.''
   Kim, president of the main opposition group, the Party for Peace
and Democracy, gave no overall figures but said ``only one-tenth of
the prisoners of conscience'' were freed.
   Those freed Monday included Lee Tae-bok, a 38-year-old publisher
whose release was demanded by delegates attending the World
Congress of PEN in Seoul in early September. PEN is a London-based
organization of literary figures.
   Lee was arrested in 1981 on charges of plotting to organize a
leftist underground movement and fomenting a communist rebellion
through a publishing company he owned, PEN said.
   He was sentenced to life, which was later commuted to 20 years
in 1983.
   PEN sought the release of three other writers also in jail for
political reasons, but they were excluded in the amnesty.
   Government officials said the other writers, mentioned by PEN,
were directly involved in arson that resulted in deaths or
anti-South Korea activities in favor of communist North Korea.
   Also Monday, 150 actors, actresses and other film workers
protested outside a Seoul cinema against the independent
distribution of U.S. films.
   Protesters gathered in front of a downtown movie theater showing
the U.S. film ``Fatal Attraction'' and sat in the entrance.
   Some sang songs or held placards asking fans to boycott the
theater in order to ``guard our culture and our industry.''
   Billboards advertising the movie were peppered with black
splotches from paint bombs, part of an earlier protest. Statements
passed out to bystanders claimed that direct distribution of
American films was ``an attempt to seize complete domination'' of
South Korea's film industry.
   Police reported no arrests and the protest was peaceful.
   American films have been available in South Korea, but under a
new trade liberalization law U.S. filmakers are being allowed to
distribute movies directly to South Korean cinemas instead of
through South Korean producers.
   Local film producers say the new regulations will wreck the
local industry.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans believe bribe-taking is rampant in the
federal government, a Media General-Associated Press poll has found.
   The national survey of 1,125 adults found deep skepticism of
government integrity. In the most critical finding, an overwhelming
70 percent said they thought taking illegal payoffs for special
favors was widespread.
   Fully half the respondents called the government dishonest
overall and seven in 10 called it poorly managed. Even more, 82
percent, said they were not surprised to learn of recent corruption
charges involving the Pentagon.
   On specific cases, a plurality said former Attorney General
Edwin Meese III should have been charged with crimes, and half
opposed the suggestion of a presidential pardon for former national
security adviser John Poindexter, the highest official charged in
the Iran-Contra case.
   Respondents were evenly split on a pardon for Poindexter's
assistant, former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, who gained support
through his defense of his actions at congressional hearings last
year.
   The Reagan administration did not carry heavy blame for the
overall doubt about government honesty. While 43 percent said the
administration had done a bad job of enforcing ethical standards,
40 percent said it had done a good job. The split was insignificant
given the poll's three-point error margin.
   Also, 51 percent said the administration had done a good job of
managing the government, even though most said the government was
poorly managed overall. And 55 percent did not blame the
administration for the Pentagon scandal.
   Democrats predominated in the 35 percent who did blame the
administration for the Pentagon case, which involves allegations of
payoffs in the awarding of military contracts. But large majorities
of all groups, Republicans and independents included, were
unsurprised by the charges.
   Similarly, majorities of all demographic and ideological groups
said they believed taking payoffs was widespread in the government
_ from a low of 60 percent of Republicans to a high of 82 percent
of liberals. Overall, just 20 percent of the respondents did not
believe payoffs were widespread.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis proposed tighter
ethics rules and sharply criticized the administration for its
ethical performance last week. But the poll, conducted Sept. 6-14,
found respondents split evenly on whether Dukakis or Republican
nominee George Bush would be better at enforcing ethical standards.
   In the Iran-Contra case, Poindexter and North have been charged
with conspiring while in the White House to sell arms to Iran in
exchange for American hostages, and to divert the proceeds to the
Nicaraguan rebels. Their trial will not take place before the
election; Bush has said he hopes North is acquitted.
   Fifty percent in the poll agreed that Poindexter should have
been charged; 30 percent said not and the rest didn't know. There
was a greater division on North: Forty-three percent agreed with
the charges, 42 percent did not.
   The breakdown was the same on whether President Reagan should
pardon the men: On Poindexter, half said no and 30 percent yes; on
North, 41 percent said he should be pardoned, 44 percent said not.
   Meese, attorney general since 1985, resigned this summer, saying
he had been vindicated of corruption allegations by a special
prosecutor's decision not to seek charges against him. The
prosecutor said Meese probably violated tax laws and conflict of
interest laws, but did not file charges because he had no evidence
that Meese sought personal gain.
   Forty-six percent in the survey, however, said Meese should have
been charged with crimes. Thirty percent agreed with the decision
not to charge him and the remaining 23 percent had no opinion.
   Republicans were the strongest supporters of Meese, North and
Poindexter, with Democrats the greatest critics and independents
more divided. On ethics and management as well, Republicans
strongly supported the administration and most Democrats rated it
poorly. Most independents said the administration had done well on
management, but they were split on ethical enforcement.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis bantered with
pupils at a public elementary school today and told one of them
that Vice President George Bush was like a drug that ``puts you to
sleep.''
   The Massachusetts governor began a campaign swing that aides
said would tie together various themes he has been sounding over
the past few weeks, particularly education.
   Speaking with fourth- and fifth-grade pupils at the Alfred E.
Burr Elementary School here, Dukakis talked about drugs and asked
the students if they knew the names of bad drugs. One child
declared, ``Bush is a drug.''
   To that, the Democratic joked, ``Puts you to sleep, right?''
   Dukakis told the students that his goal was making the United
States ``No. 1 and staying No. 1.''
   ``If we are going to be the best then we are going to have to
build a very strong future,'' Dukakis said, urging the youngsters
to consider careers as teachers or scientists.
   Dukakis also talked about the landing today of the Discovery
space shuttle at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., which his
Republican rival attended.
   From the school, Dukakis headed for a rally at the Connecticut
statehouse and planned to fly to Detroit to observe the destruction
of an illegal drug cache.
   Dukakis adviser Kirk O'Donnell said the nominee's focus during
campaign appearances this week ``will be on the future ... and
children are a good way to do it.'' He said Dukakis would be
visiting other schools to press that theme.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly by
computer and interviews were conducted with the adult in each
household who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results,
19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five
points, for example, for Republicans.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed
100:
   1. Overall, do you think the federal government is well-managed,
or is it poorly managed? Well: 19 percent. Poorly: 69 percent.
Don't Know-No Answer: 12 percent.
   2. Do you think of the federal government overall as honest, or
not? Yes: 40. No: 50. DK-NA: 10.
   3. When it comes to managing the federal government, do you
think the Reagan administration has done a good job or a bad job?
Good: 51. Bad: 33. DK-NA: 16.
   4. How about when it comes to enforcing ethical standards in the
federal government _ do you think the Reagan administration has
done a good job or a bad job? Good: 40. Bad: 43. DK-NA: 17.
   5. Regardless of how you may vote, who do you think would be
better at enforcing ethical standards in the federal government _
George Bush or Michael Dukakis? Bush: 38. Dukakis: 40. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Who do you think would be better at managing the federal
government _ George Bush or Michael Dukakis? Bush: 50. Dukakis: 34.
DK-NA: 16.
   7. The special counsel who investigated former Attorney General
Edwin Meese said Meese probably violated tax laws and conflict of
interest laws. But the special counsel did not file criminal
charges because he found no evidence that Meese sought personal
gain. Do you think Meese should have been charged with crimes, or
not? Yes: 46. No: 30. DK-NA: 23.
   8. In a different case, a special prosecutor has filed criminal
charges against two former Reagan administration officials _ John
Poindexter and Oliver North _ for their roles in the Iran-Contra
affair. Do you think John Poindexter should have been charged with
crimes, or not? Yes: 50. No: 30. DK-NA: 20.
   8a. how about Oliver North _ should he have been charged with
crimes, or not? Yes: 43. No: 42. DK-NA: 15.

<HEAD>General Strike Ends In Burma, Government Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government said nearly all
civil servants and factory workers obeyed an order to return to
work Monday, ending a monthlong general strike aimed at ending 26
years of authoritarian rule.
   The state radio announced that attendance at 18 ministries and
various departments was about 95 percent, while all civil servants
returned to their jobs in the second largest city of Mandalay. The
strike began Aug. 8.
   The radio said security forces killed four more people, who were
looting a gasoline station in eastern Rangoon, bringing to about
430 the number of people who by official count have died since Gen.
Saw Maung seized power in a military coup Sept. 18 and ruthlessly
put down anti-government demonstrations.
   Although tens of thousands of workers returned to their jobs,
many left after drawing their salaries and signing attendance
sheets. The government had earlier ordered a resumption of work
under penalty of dismissal.
   The only acts of defiance reported in the capital Monday were
several small hit-and-run demonstrations by students.
   The strike was the first mass labor agitation since strongman Ne
Win seized power in 1962 and instituted a military-backed,
one-party system.
   Despite the apparent end of the strike, it appeared unlikely the
government machinery and state-owned factories would regain
momentum in the near future.
   Most of the country's more than 1,000 factories had ceased
operations and are faced with lack of spare parts and raw
materials. A large number have been ransacked by looters who stole
or destroyed machinery and materials.
   Several thousand students, who spearheaded the anti-government
protests, have fled to remote border areas under the control of the
Karen and other ethnic minorities who are also fighting the central
government.
   Associated Press newswoman Molly Yong, reporting from the Karen
guerrilla camp of Thay Baw Bo, said rebel leader Gen. Bo Mya Monday
appealed for international aid to 3,500 students who have fled to
his rebel bases.
   Bo Mya said the Karens would allow the students to set up
independently run camps where the rebels would provide military
training and arm the students for a war against the military-run
government in Rangoon.
   The Karens are among a dozen major ethnic minority groups in
Burma, a country of 38 million people. The Karens, who live largely
along the Thai-Burmese border and in the Irrawaddy delta, number
about 2 million.
   During the colonial period large numbers were converted to
Christianity by American missionaries and enjoyed relative freedom
under the British rule.
   Feeling that the promise of autonomy within a federal system
after independence had been broken, a number of Karens fled to
jungle areas along the border and in 1949 rose up in rebellion,
managing to fight their way to the gates of Rangoon before being
pushed back to their sanctuaries.
   Bo Mya said recently that his insurgent group, called the Karen
National Union, fields 17,000 troops.

   Radicals opposed to Japan's monarchy desecrated
several imperial institutions around the country as Emperor
Hirohito lay in serious but stable condition Monday, police and
palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old Hirohito, who fell ill Sept. 19 after vomiting
blood, was given another 0.4 pint blood transfusion to fight
anemia, but otherwise remained in stable condition, palace
spokesman Kenji Maeda told reporters.
   Hirohito's fever fluctuated during the day between 98.6 and
100.58 degrees, but fell back to the 98.6-degree level Monday
night. Maeda said Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning monarch,
was ``resting quietly.''
   Police said radicals claiming to belong to the Revolutionary
Workers' Association spray-painted a sign at the burial mound of
Emperor Jimmu, the country's legendary first sovereign, and
scattered horse feces on the ground in Nara, western Japan.
Leaflets demanding an end to the monarchy were also found at the
site, said a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He said the scraps of paper bore the name of the leftist group.
   In neighboring Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, two suspected
leftists ignited a smoke bomb in front of a local office of the
Imperial Household Agency and scattered leaflets signed by the
association near the smoldering device, said Kenichi Yoshino, a
police spokesman in neighboring Kyoto.
   Yoshino said several of the leaflets were also found near a
caretaker's office which overlooks the grave of Emperor Meiji, who
died in 1912.
   In Tokyo, two paper bags containing smoke bombs and batteries
exploded after they were apparently ignited by firecrackers at
subway stations near the Imperial Palace, police said. No one was
injured in the incidents.
   ``The explosions were apparently the actions of radicals opposed
to the extensive coverage by the media of Emperor Hirohito's
illness,'' said a police official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Two more people were reported killed
in this southern city Monday, and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan met
with local leaders about ethnic violence that claimed more than 200
lives over the weekend.
   People fired guns into the air during a two-hour break in the
curfew late Monday afternoon and one person was killed by a stray
bullet, police reported. They said the second was shot by an
attacker who fled.
   Ishaq Khan met with officials of the city and Sind province
about the violence. It began Friday night with an attack by Sindhi
gunmen on immigrants from India called Mohajirs, in which at least
160 people died.
   He also has visited Karachi, the country's largest city, where
more than 50 people were killed after the Hyderabad massacre.
   Some opposition politicians have suggested agents of India were
behind the violence in Sind province, but government officials have
not been so speific.
   A statement distributed by the official news agency APP quoted
Ishaq Khan as saying: ``Those who are trying to pit brother against
brother are the real enemies of Pakistan, and the government has
taken note of it. The government is fully aware of the elements who
indulged in the bloodbath and will eliminate them with an iron
hand.''
   Those ``elements'' were not identified.
   Karachi was reported quiet Monday, with several districts under
curfew and soldiers in armored vehicles patrolling the streets.
Military units also patrolled Hyderabad, 100 miles northeast of
Karachi.
   Gen. Aslam Beg, the army commander, and some other officials
claimed the violence was part of a conspiracy to disrupt national
elections set for Nov. 16. The statement by Ishaq Khan said
elections ``will be held on schedule and in an impartial, fair and
free manner.''
   Police and witnesses said the main culprits in Friday's
Hyderabad massacre were members of the Jeay Sind movement who want
an independent homeland.
   Mohajirs, almost 40 percent of the province's population, have
formed their own group to seek recognition as a nationality along
with Sindhis, Punjabis, Baluchis and Pathans.
   Karachi and Hyderabad have a history of ethnic troubles between
local tribes and immigrants from India and other parts of Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   A group of 150 British travelers arrived home
Monday, 56 hours after they set out on what was to be a four-hour
trip from Greece.
   ``We felt like a cargo of toxic waste that nobody wanted,'' said
Sara Hind, a costume designer, when the group reached London's
Gatwick airport at 2 a.m. They left the resort island of Skiathos
in the northern Aegean Sea on Friday.
   Airport officials said passengers were delayed by a 48-hour
strike of Greek civil aviation workers. Officials said hundreds of
tourists were transferred by sea from closed island airports to the
mainland and bused to Athens airport.
   ``When we finally landed at Gatwick, we gave ourselves a round
of applause for sticking it through without going round the bend
(mad),'' Ms. Hind said.

<TEXT>
   The capital's 17,000 taxi drivers on
Monday began a 15-day boycott of downtown Athens to protest a
controversial set of anti-pollution measures that restrict cab
circulation in the area.
   Taxis are included in traffic restrictions banning half of
Athens' 800,000 cars from a five-square-mile zone around the city
center between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays, according to odd and
even license plate numbers.
   ``The government can't go on blaming us for Athens' pollution,''
said an Athens Taxi Drivers' Union spokesman. ``This strike will
prove that even when we don't circulate in the city center the area
will be plagued by the nefos.''
   `Nefos,' which means cloud in Greek, is the Athenian term for
the brown smog layer that forms over the city on windless days.

   Harold Robinson, the general secretary of
the Dunkirk Veterans Association, died from injuries suffered in a
fall, his family said Monday. He was 68.
   Robinson, died Sunday in a hospital in Leeds, northern England,
his son Nigel said. He said Robinson was paralyzed from the neck
down when he fell down a flight of stairs at his home on Wednesday.
   The former prisoner of war was made a member of the Order of the
British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II and was awarded the French
National Order of Merit for his part in founding the World War II
veterans association which has a worldwide membership of 50,000.
   Nearly 200,000 British soldiers and 140,000 French troops were
ferried across the English Channel from Dunkirk in northern France
between May 26, 1940, and June 2, 1940, to escape rapidly advancing
German troops.
   Robinson is also survived by his wife, Eileen, and another son.

<TEXT>
   The wife and mother-in-law of
heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson called police over the
weekend when he flew into a rage but no complaints were filed and
no arrests were made, authorities confirmed today.
   ``The man has done nothing wrong,'' Chief Thomas J. Sciaretta
said at a news conference following reports that Tyson hurled
furniture through windows of his mansion Sunday morning. ``It's his
home. He's entitled to do anything he pleases, provided no one is
injured.''
   Tyson's rage was sparked by an interview his wife, actress Robin
Givens, and mother-in-law, Ruth Roper, had with Barbara Walters,
which was broadast Friday on ABC's ``20-20,'' the New York Post and
New York Daily News reported.
   In the interview, Givens and Roper portrayed Tyson, 22, as a
``scary'' and ``frightening'' person to live with.
   The Post said Tyson, who has said he is manic-depressive, hurled
a sugar bowl, a fireplace andiron and chairs through the windows of
his home. The News said Tyson brandished ``an instrument'' from the
fireplace and ran through the home smashing windows.
   The police chief said there was damage but would disclose only
that there was broken glass in the foyer.
   People suffering from manic-depression can alternate between
moods of abnormal excitability and mental depression. In last
week's television interview, Tyson said he would not take
medication for the ailment.
   Sciaretta disclosed the barest of details of the case.
   He said he believed it was Givens, a star of television's ``Head
of the Class,'' who called his department about a disturbance at
Tyson's northern New Jersey estate.
   When police arrived, they spoke with Givens and Roper, who asked
the officers to speak to Tyson and calm him down, Sciaretta said.
   The officers explained to Tyson that they just wanted to resolve
the situation but the boxer felt the police presence was
unwarranted, the chief said.
   When Givens and her mother left the estate a short time later,
Tyson was in the driveway, Sciaretta said, adding that Tyson left
shortly thereafter.
   He refused to elaborate further.
   The Post said Tyson drove to New York City. Hours later, he
phoned for a limousine to pick him up after he missed meeting a
friend, the newspaper said.
   ``I've heard things, but I cannot comment on it,'' said Bill
Cayton, Tyson's manager.
   But the 83-year-old woman who has been characterized as Tyson's
``adopted'' mother, Camille Ewald, told the Post that Tyson's
behavior comes as no surprise in light of the ``20-20'' interview.
   ``I think that if I was Mike I would have choked her right then
and there on that show,'' she said. ``She was trying to belittle
him, take everything away, his dignity, and embarrass him in
public.''
   The reported incident came one day after the three celebrated
Roper's birthday. The Post said the champion ``didn't seem to be
that upset'' Saturday as he watched the heavyweight Olympic bout on
TV with Finkel and boxer Ed Hopson.
   It was only the latest in a series of problems for Tyson. Last
month, he crashed in his car and was knocked unconscious, forcing
him to postpone a match, and news reports later said he had
threatened beforehand to kill himself.
   Meanwhile, boxer Mitch Green, who had an impromptu fight with
Tyson outside a Harlem clothing store in August, was arrested
Sunday for the third time in less than two weeks Sunday after
police found him in a car that had crashed into a parked vehicle,
authorities said.
   Green, 31, who was charged with driving while impaired, has had
his driver's license suspended 54 times, police said.
   Green pressed assault charges following his Aug. 23 street fight
with Tyson, but dropped them three days later. He lost a bout with
Tyson for the U.S. Boxing Association heavyweight title in 1986.

<HEAD>Eskimos Lose Challenge to Pipeline Rates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS Artic to Arctic throughout.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the rates being charged for transporting oil through the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a rate agreement
between Alaska and the pipeline's eight owners.
   The rates were challenged by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp.,
established under Alaska law to protect the rights of Inupiat
Eskimos.
   Lawyers for Arctic said the pipeline rate agreement, which
extends through the year 2011, ``will have a critical effect on the
development and cost of oil from the Alaska North Slope, an energy
resource vital to our nation's economy and security.''
   After large reserves of oil were discovered on Alaska's North
Slope in 1969, eight oil companies constructed an 800-mile pipeline
to the all-weather port of Valdez on the state's Pacific coast.
   The pipeline was completed in 1977, at a cost of some $9 billion.
   The Alaska law, aimed at promoting oil production, extinguished
the land claims of native Alaskans by compensating them with money.
   Arctic is one of 13 regional corporations given ownership of
lands formerly held by natives. Arctic leases much of its 4.5
million acres for the benefit of its Inupiat Eskimo shareholders.
   Oil from Arctic's lands likely will start being shipped through
the pipeline sometime in the 1990s, and the oil's value to Arctic
will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by charges levied for
transporting it.
   After nine years of administrative proceedings, Alaska and the
pipeline's eight owners reached a rate agreement in 1986.
   Arctic attempted to challenge the agreement, contending that the
per-barrel rates it yielded are too high.
   But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the
agreement as uncontested after ruling that Arctic was not
``particularly aggrieved'' by the pipeline rates.
   A federal appeals court here upheld the commission ruling last
Oct. 27 after noting that the rate agreement is not binding on
Arctic, and that Arctic is free to challenge the rates once oil
from its lands begin to pass through the pipeline.
   ``Arctic can properly be left out in the cold for the moment,''
the appeals court ruled, adding, ``The commission acted within its
lawful authority and discretion in closing a long and wearisome
chapter in the saga of (Trans-Alaska Pipeline) rate regulation.''
   The pipeline's owners are Amerada Hess, Arco, BP, Exxon, Mobil,
Phillips, Sohio and Unocal.
   The case is Arctic Slope Regional Corp. vs. FERC, 87-1869.

   Cheers erupted from
425,000 people today who gathered in tents, motor homes and trucks
and atop every NASA building here as the space shuttle completed
the first flight since Challenger exploded.
   ``I had goose bumps all over,'' said Diane Bonds, who traveled
600 miles from Roy, Utah, to watch Discovery touch down. ``I have
always wanted to see one of these and now I have.''
   ``I think we're back on top,'' said Mike Asfall, who supervises
training for Air Force and NASA personnel working on the main
shuttle engine at Rockwell International's Rocketdyne plant in
Canoga Park, Calif.
   ``Everyone has a flag up. It's so patriotic,'' said John
Tibbets, 78, who led an 11-unit brigade of Airstream trailers from
the San Bernardino Airstreams Club across shimmering desert roads
to the public viewing site Sunday.
   Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. George Neiss said 109,000 vehicles
carried an estimated 410,000 people to the public viewing site by
the time Discovery landed at 9:37 a.m. PDT. At least 15,000 more
were in the VIP section, where Vice President George Bush was on
hand to greet the astronauts as they descended from the orbiter.
   Only one larger crowd had ever gathered to watch a shuttle land:
an estimated 500,000 for the shuttle Columbia on July 4, 1982, when
President and Nancy Reagan greeted the astronauts.
   Screams broke out from the public viewing area on the hard clay
eastern shore of Rogers Dry Lake at 9:34 a.m., as two sonic booms
reverberated across the Joshua-tree dotted high desert. Then cheers
and applause broke out as Discovery appeared in the sky.
   Crowds also cheered from atop NASA buildings as the
Star-Spangled Banner began blaring when the orbiter completed a
fast turn high over the lakebed and plummeted swiftly to Earth,
then coasted to a stop.
   All day Sunday, recreational vehicles, cars and even big rigs
streamed across heat-rippled two-lane blacktop and took up
positions surrounded by rattlesnake-infested desert. Despite some
concern about the reptiles, medics reported no problems.
   The camp of silver Airstream cocoons, decorated with American
and California flags, joined thousands of other motor homes on the
44-square-mile lake bed where the shuttle was to land.
   ``This is what America's all about,'' said Vic Failla, 61, a
World War II veteran from La Verne who brought his brother, Tony,
to this air base 80 miles north of Los Angeles.
   License plates on the motor homes, trucks and cars represented
states as far away as North Dakota and Florida.
   The crowd was festive but orderly. The constant whir of portable
generators droned throughout the day and night. Campers peered
through binoculars and telescopes and set out jugs of tea to brew
in the 102-degree heat. Teen-agers buzzed around on all-terrain
vehicles.
   Vendors hawked tiny flags and other souvenirs, such as Stealth
bomber models and mugs. Alice Brakke, selling $2 flags, and
witnessing her 18th shuttle landing, broadcast from her booth a
tape of the late Kate Smith singing ``God Bless America.''
   Other speakers broadcast news from the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
   ``It's like a kid going to Disneyland,'' said Gordon Gilmore,
56, of Fort Worth, Texas. ``All these flags are really something.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today granted a stay of
execution for a convicted killer who had said he wanted his
execution by lethal injection to take place tonight as scheduled.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
granted the stay on a motion claiming that Gerald Smith, convicted
of fatally beating a woman with an 8-pound metal bar, may not be
competent to decide on filing appeals of his sentence.
   Smith's execution would have been the first in Missouri in 23
years.
   The panel said more time was needed for the full court to
determine whether Smith was competent to make decisions on his own
fate.
   Assistant Attorney General John Morris said the state would file
a motion as quickly as possible challenging the stay. He said he
did not know exactly what type of legal motion it would be.
   The stay was sought by the Missouri Public Defender Commission.
   On Sunday, about 50 death penalty opponents rallied on the
Capitol lawn, just blocks from the Missouri State Penitentiary
where Smith was scheduled to be executed by injection at 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday, three days before his 30th birthday.
   Speakers denounced capital punishment as state-sanctioned
homicide and called on Republican Gov. John Ashcroft or the courts
to block the execution.
   A spokesman for Ashcroft, a death penalty supporter, has said
the governor would not stop the execution.
   The execution would be the first to be carried out since 1965
and the first under Missouri's 11-year-old reinstated capital
punishment law.
   Smith has demanded that all appeals be dropped. In the past,
he's asked that appeals be halted, but later changed his mind.
However, in an interview Friday, Smith said he would not waver this
time because he considers all further appeals hopeless.
   Smith remains steadfast on wanting the execution to take place,
prison spokesman Dale Riley said.
   At the rally, speakers representing the American Civil Liberties
Union and other anti-death-penalty groups said that although Smith
was a murderer, it was not the state's place to execute him.
   On Sept. 8, 1980, Smith used an iron bar to beat to death Karen
Roberts, a woman he said had given him a venereal disease and
caused him to lose his fiancee. He received a second death penalty
for his part in the 1985 murder of fellow death row inmate Robert
Baker.
   If the execution is carried out, it would mark the first time
the state has executed anyone since Feb. 26, 1965, when Lloyd Leo
Anderson went to the gas chamber for murdering a 15-year-old St.
Louis delivery boy during a drugstore robbery.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected arguments
aimed at making it easier to sue those accused of taking part in
antitrust conspiracies uncovered years after they occurred.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to revive a lawsuit
by Colorado officials against a paving contractor accused of
bid-rigging.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case
but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Colorado's appeal was supported by law enforcement officials
from most states. They said a ruling that threw out the Colorado
suit ``rewards conspirators for the successsful concealment of
their conspiracies'' and puts a ``generally impossible burden'' on
officials pursuing bid-rigging cases.
   The Colorado attorney general's office accused Western Paving
Construction Co. of engaging in a conspiracy to rig bids on state
highway projects between 1971 and 1978.
   The state said it learned of Western Paving's role in the scheme
on July 27, 1983, when federal prosecutors disclosed a case against
another company accused of criminal bid-rigging on Colorado highway
projects.
   The state sued Western Paving, seeking triple damages, on July
19, 1984. That was more than four years after Western Paving's
alleged participation in the conspiracy, thus exceeding the statute
of limitations in the federal antitrust law covering such
violations.
   But Colorado officials said the four-year time period should be
extended because Western Paving fraudulently concealed the alleged
conspiracy.
   U.S. District Judge Alfred A. Arraj threw out the suit in 1986.
He said, ``Fraudulent concealment occurs when a defendant takes
affirmative steps in addition to the original wrongdoing to prevent
the plaintiff from discovering the wrong.''
   Colorado officials ``failed to allege any facts which constitute
affirmative acts of concealment,'' Arraj said.
   His ruling was upheld in a brief, unsigned 4-4 decision by the
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March. The 10th Circuit
court has jurisdiction in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Utah,
Oklahoma and Wyoming.
   In their Supreme Court appeal, Colorado officials said that for
the bid-rigging scheme to succeed the participants were required
actively to conceal their conduct.
   The state officials said that the participants agreed among
themselves to divide up road-building projects by taking turns
submitting low bids. The designated losing companies would submit
slightly higher bids ``to further enhance the illusion of
competition,'' the officials said.
   The states supporting Colorado's appeal said Arraj's ruling
``puts an antitrust plaintiff to the generally impossible burden of
pleading and proving that a bid-rigger took an affirmative act to
cover up that which by its very nature is already concealed.''
   They said the ruling is in conflict with other federal court
rulings.
   The case is Colorado vs. Western Paving Construction, 87-2027.

   Two Americans who planned to offer a
reward for the return of American MIAs by floating currency down
the Mekong River were arrested by authorities in Laos on Monday, a
Thai hotel executive said.
   Donna Long, 45, of Jacksonville, N.C. and another American, who
asked not to be identified, were arrested by Laotian authorities
and were being investigated, said the executive, Pornthipa
Vajarabukka.
   Miss Long told The Associated Press on Sunday the two planned to
drop plastic bags containing dollar bills and other currencies into
the river and to distribute the money in villages along the Laotian
bank of the river.
   The waterway forms a boundary with Thailand and then flows on to
both Cambodia and Vietnam. Each bill was stamped with a message
saying that a $2.4 million reward was being offered to anyone who
could bring an American prisoner of war to the International Red
Cross.
   Miss Long said the pair planned to hire a fishing boat near the
Thai city of Ubon, drop the packets into the river and then proceed
to the Laotian river bank. It was not known what the duo actually
did before they were seized.
   Miss Long revealed the plan on condition that the story was not
released until the two returned or were captured.
   The reward money to any Cambodian, Laotian or Vietnamese is
being offered through the National Steering Committee for American
War Veterans, a private MIA-POW group, which says the $2.4 million
has been pledged by 21 congressmen and the American Enterprise
Institute.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as still missing in
action from the Indochina War in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The
three Indochinese governments deny that any Americans are alive in
their countries but some private American groups disagree.
   In 1987, several MIA-POW activists, including relatives of MIAS,
floated balloons down the Mekong River from the Thai shore with
offers of the $2.4 million reward with no known result.
   Members of the committee, including its chairman Ted Sampley,
were scheduled to arrive in Thailand on Wednesday.
   Ms. Pornthipa, a manager at Ubon's Phatum Rat Hotel, said the
two sought assistance to find their way to the river and the hotel
felt obliged to help them. She said she would cross the river to
Laos, something allowed for Thai nationals, on Tuesday to deliver
food and inquire about their status.

   Authorities made 110 arrests, including
actor Martin Sheen, at the Nevada Test Site during a nuclear
weapons protest celebrating the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.
   Some 200 protesters were on hand for Sunday's observance, said
Energy Department spokesman Chris West.
   Many of the protesters were arrested more than once when they
crossed the test site boundary, were arrested and released, then
crossed again, West said. All were cited for misdemeanor trespass.
   Sheen has been arrested numerous times in demonstrations at the

   The League of Women Voters withdrew today as
sponsor of the presidential debate in Los Angeles later this month,
saying it refused to be ``an accessory to the hoodwinking of the
American people'' by the George Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigns.
   The league's surprise announcement immediately threw into doubt
the second nationally televised confrontation between the
presidential candidates, which had been scheduled for Oct. 13 or
Oct 14.
   League president Nancy M. Neuman said the group was presented
with a debate agreement between the Bush and Dukakis campaigns and
was told that the league had to accept it.
   ``The campaigns' agreement was a closed-door masterpiece,'' she
said. ``The agreement was a done deal, they told us.''
   ``It turned out that the league had two choices,'' she said.
``We could sign their closed-door agreement and hope the event
would rise above their manipulations or we could refuse to lend our
trusted name to this charade.''
   Ms. Neuman said: ``The League of Women Voters is announcing
today that we have no intention of becoming an accessory to the
hoodwinking of the American people. ... Under these circumstances,
the league is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential
debate scheduled for mid-October in Los Angeles.''
   In letters to Bush campaign chairman James Baker III and Dukakis
campaign chairman Paul Brountas, she said the league would
reconsider its stance if the campaigns withdrew their
``non-negotiable demands.''
   The league released a copy of the candidates' agreement.
   ``It spelled out everything,'' Ms. Neuman said. ``Between
themselves, the campaigns had determined what the TV cameras could
take pictures of. They had determined how they would select who
would pose questions to their candidates.
   ``They had determined that the press would be relegated to the
last two rows of the hall. They had determined that they would pack
the hall with their supporters. They had determined the format.''
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk, campaigning with Dukakis
in Connecticut, said a joint party debate commission could assume
sponsorship and hold the second debate either as scheduled or after
a brief delay.
   The campaigns' agreement calls for each side's ``best efforts to
obtain a mutually agreeable sponsor'' if one of the original
sponsors drop out.
   There was no certainty Bush would agree to a new sponsor. The
GOP nominee holds a narrow lead over Dukakis in national public
opinion polls and was the one who insisted on league involvement in
the debates.
   Kirk brushed aside any possibility that Bush might not
participate in a second debate.
   ``They may try, but I don't think they can,'' he said. ``They
are committed to two presidential debates and the American people
are well aware of that. Even if they tried to do an end run around
it, I don't think they can get out of it.''
   Bush, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, said he was not
aware of the League's withdrawal. When reporters asked Bush whether
he would attend if the joint party commission picked up
sponsorship, the vice president said, ``I can't answer a
hypothetical question.''
   The league, the traditional sponsor of presidential debates, was
pushed aside in the battle for sponsorship of the first
presidential debate held Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem, N.C., by a
commission created by the two major political parties.
   The Dukakis campaign sided with the party commission early in
the year, but the Bush campaign left the issue of sponsorship open
until after the GOP National Convention in August.
   Then the campaigns negotiated a compromise in which the two
scheduled debates were split between the two contending sponsors.
   The party commission also was awarded the sponsorship of the
debate this Wednesday in Omaha, Neb., between Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and his Republican
counterpart, Dan Quayle.
   The league had already signed contracts for a hall in Los
Angeles and made other arrangments for the second Bush-Dukakis
debate.
   But knowledgeable sources said there was no agreement about the
stage, podiums or panel of questioners for the second debate, and
that the campaigns had not discussed final arrangements with the
league by late last week.

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Franz Josef Strauss, a right-wing
state governor who upstaged federal chancellors and left his mark
on world affairs, died Monday at age 73.
   ``He was one of the architects of the Federal Republic (West
Germany),'' Bavarian radio said during a break in somber music it
broadcast to mark the governor's death. He had collapsed during a
weekend hunting trip.
   Strauss was a formidable power for decades and weathered a 1962
scandal that forced his resignation as federal defense minister. He
led the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's national Christian Democrats.
   Kohl's office said the chancellor was breaking off a trip to the
Far East to return to West Germany.
   Spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said the government was ``deeply
affected'' by the death of Strauss. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher called him ``one of the most important personalities of
German postwar history'' and declared: ``His political achievements
deserve the respect of all citizens.''
   His influence was particularly strong during the last decade,
when he was governor of Bavaria, and Kohl needed approval from the
burly boss of Munich for major domestic programs.
   It was in foreign affairs, however, that Strauss insisted on
making his influence felt and his name known.
   He visited communist East Germany in 1983 to deliver a credit
line of 1 billion marks, then worth $400 million, in return for
concessions that included removal of some guns and mines from the
border.
   Also in 1983, Strauss visited Poland and Czechoslovakia for
talks with the leaders of those Soviet-bloc states.
   In Israel two years later he defended his advocacy of West
German arms sales to Saudi Arabia, dismissing claims that his
country should not sell arms to Arabs because of its moral
responsibility for Nazi crimes against Jews.
   Strauss was a firm supporter of NATO and its decision to base
nuclear missiles in Western Europe.
   He was fluent in English and often visited Washington for
meetings with U.S. political leaders, including President Reagan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that Reagan
sent a message of condolence describing Strauss as ``one of the
great figures in the democratic history of the Federal Republic of
Germany. He was a firm friend of the United States, sharing our
dedication to human freedom and close cooperation between our two
countries.''
   An active amateur pilot, Strauss flew the airplane that took a
Bavarian delegation to the Soviet Union in December 1987 for talks
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and leaders.
   A month later, he visited Johannesburg and expressed ``moderate
optimism'' about South Africa, whose 26 million blacks are denied a
voice in national affairs. He also said the white authorities
deserved recognition for reforms.
   The governor was outspoken and fervently Roman Catholic, two
characteristics of his mountainous southern state.
   He collapsed Saturday while hunting in the Regensburg area with
Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, one of the world's richest men
and West Germany's largest landowner.
   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau said in its evening
editions Monday: ``F.J. Strauss is Dead! State Ceremony Ordered.''
   Accompanying the front-page article was a photograph of Strauss
and the prince, both clad in traditional green loden Alpine hunting
outfits, taken on a simliar outing in 1983.
   An official announcement said Strauss died in a Regensburg
hospital after ``multiple-organ failure,'' including kidneys and
lungs. The cause of death was given as ``heart and circulation
failure.''
   Strauss had been in a coma, kept alive with a respirator.
   As defense minister in the early 1960s, Strauss claimed a report
in Der Spiegel magazine criticizing military maneuvers bordered on
treason. He created further controversy by ordering several of the
left-leaning magazine's staff members arrested, and was forced to
resign in 1962.
   Leftist publications also accused Strauss of involvement in
payoff scandals in the purchase of military fighter jets, and in
deals involving the U.S. aircraft company Lockheed.
   One of the governor's favorite political sports was taunting
leftist foes. After his death, the Greens party said his name was
synonomous with ``cold War, arms buildup, atomic policies and a
magisterial understanding of politics.''
   Strauss became a cabinet member in 1953 under West Germany's
first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, and was finance minister the
``Great Coalition'' Kurt Georg Kiesinger formed in 1966 with the
leftist Social Democrats. He became governor of Bavaria in 1978.
   His wife died after a car accident in 1984. His three children _
daughter Monika Hohlmeier and two sons Max-Josef and Franz-Georg _
live in the Munich area.

<HEAD>British Publisher Of Henry Miller Novel Could Be Prosecuted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British publisher of a 1940 novel by American
writer Henry Miller faces possible prosecution after complaints
about the book's explicit sexuality, prosecutors said Monday.
   The Director of Public Prosecutions said it is considering
taking action over Miller's ``Opus Pistorum,'' which surfaced three
years after Miller died at age 88 in June 1980.
   The investigation was prompted by recent complaints from the
public, including one from Christian Action Research and Education,
an evangelical charity that promotes traditional family values, the
prosecutor's office said.
   ``The matter is under consideration,'' said a spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   Publisher W. H. Allen said it has sold about 60,000 copies of
the novel, subtitled ``Under the Roofs of Paris,'' in the last four
years.
   Britain's leading news agents, W. H. Smith, said it had
withdrawn the book from its shelves, not because it is being
investigated but ``because it is not selling well,'' a spokesman
said.
   ``If you're a customer, you can still place an order for the
book,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition on anonymity.
   Miller wrote ``Tropic of Cancer'' and other books which gave
frank accounts of his life and sexual exploits in New York and
Paris and were banned in the United States until 1961.
   The last successful obscenity prosecution in Britain against an
acclaimed writer was in the mid-1960s when Hubert Selby Jr.'s
account of homosexuality in ``Last Exit to Brooklyn'' was banned.

   Vice President George
Bush, taking full advantage of his incumbency, greeted the
returning Discovery astronauts today as they departed the space
shuttle with a large American flag in hand.
   The vice president said it was ``a great day for our country.''
   A campaign spokesman had said that Bush wanted to be the first
person the astronauts would see upon their return, and he was,
standing with several top NASA officials at the foot of the shuttle
ramp. The astronauts led Bush in the traditional walk-around to
review the shape of the ship. After posing for photos, Bush snapped
a salute to the astronauts.
   The Republican presidential nominee said ``Wasn't that great?''
over and over after the shuttle taxied to a stop here. Bush, with
NASA officials and veteran flyer Chuck Yeager at his side, then
greeted the five crew members once they left the shuttle.
   Bush scheduled a rally in Redding later today and also planned
to spend Tuesday in California, a critical state where polls show
the White House race dead even.
   The four-day, one-hour flight of Discovery was the first shuttle
mission since Challenger exploded in January 1986, killing its
astronaut crew and schoolteacher passenger. Bush said last week it
was ``great to be back in space'' with the shuttle and that the
return was overdue.
   The high visibility of the landing offered the GOP nominee wide
publicity in his contest with Democrat Michael Dukakis, following a
quiet weekend at home for both candidates. Dukakis praised the
landing from afar.
   Bush was asked last week if he would invite Dukakis to join him
at the shuttle landing. He replied negatively, saying such an
invitation would politicize the event.
   Bush aides said he would be there by virtue of his office, not
as a candidate for the presidency. But the shuttle stop puts Bush
in a position to continue his battle for California's 47 electoral
votes.
   Both Bush and Dukakis are devoting substantial resources and
time in the state, where polls have shown the race a virtual dead
heat.
   The California trip comes on the heels of new reports about a
matter that continues to dog Bush _ his dealings with Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted in the United
States on drug trafficking charges.
   Former CIA chief Stansfield Turner said Sunday that Bush
fostered close ties with Noriega, but he did not know whether the
vice president played a role in reinstating the Panamanian ruler to
the CIA payroll in the 1980s.
   ``It's not a coincidence that every time Bush was in the
government, we were very friendly with the Noriegas and the
Marcoses (former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos) and that
ilk,'' said Turner, who headed the agency in the Carter
administration and now supports Dukakis.
   Turner, in a telephone interview from New Orleans, said Noriega
was taken off the CIA payroll after Turner became director in March
1977. But payments to Noriega resumed during the Reagan
administration, he said.
   Turner denied published reports that he had accused Bush of
instigating a resumption of CIA payments to Noriega.

   Penn State football Coach Joe Paterno will
meet his match this week _ a man for whom ``nothing has been normal
since'' he won a Paterno look-alike contest.
   Edward H. Ravitch, 54, was chosen last week by Penn State's
Homecoming Committee out of 71 entrants, including three dogs, said
homecoming Chairman Marc Weinberg.
   Ravitch meets the coach Friday morning, is part of Penn State's
homecoming parade that afternoon and meets with alumni that night,
Weinberg said. On Saturday, Ravitch will sit with the homecoming
king and queen as the Nittany Lions take on the Cincinnati Bearcats
in State College.
   Ravitch says he's thrilled with the limelight.
   ``I'm a ham,'' he said.
   Ravitch, a former teacher turned inventor, said it's been hard
trying to find clothes to match Paterno's.
   ``He wears his pants short, above his socks,'' Ravitch said.
``That's archaic.''
   A 1978 graduate of Temple, Ravitch said he has no hard feelings
toward Paterno after Temple's 45-9 drubbing by Penn State on
Saturday.
   ``I have great respect for him because he cares for his kids as
sons, not only as players,'' said Ravitch.
   But he said he'll take the opportunity to kid Paterno.
   ``I'll tell him we don't look alike,'' said Ravitch. ``I'm
better looking than he is.''

   Oprah Winfrey promises to reveal how she
lost 54.2 pounds _ as soon as she loses 10 more pounds.
   The talk show host said losing the weight was her ``single
greatest accomplishment.''
   Winfrey's brief visit here and appearance before 4,000 people
raised about $40,000 for the United Way of the Central Carolinas
and the United Way of Gaston County.
   She decided to do the benefit Sunday, she said, because the
money would help battered women ``who are trying to turn their
lives around.''
   The cheerleading talk for women was punctuated with anecdotes
about herself _ childhood with her grandmother in Mississippi and
how she became bald after a visit to a hairdresser ordered by her
bosses at a Baltimore television station.
   As the show ended, Denver sculptor Marge Crunkleton presented
her with a clay statue of Sophia, Winfrey's character in ``The
Color Purple,'' which was filmed in Anson County.

   Olympic diver Greg Louganis, who won two gold

the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
   The dives that made Louganis famous _ the jackknife, twister and
back dive _ were captured on four silver coins issued by the
Marshall Islands, located between the Philippines and Hawaii.
   Three one-ounce $25 coins are sold in a set for $300; a 5-ounce,
$75 coin is offered for $300. The coin series are legal tender in
the Marshalls.
   ``I'm flattered because the coins are beautiful and because
they're honoring me on a coin,'' Louganis said while signing
autographs Sunday at the Long Beach Philatelic and Numismatic Show
at the city's convention center.
   Some proceeds from sales of the coin, the first to honor a
living American athlete, will benefit the Amateur Athletic Union
and United States Diving Inc., officials said.

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Chadian President
Hissene Habre, bitter enemies in a long desert conflict, restored
diplomatic relations between their nations Monday and agreed to
solve their differences peacefully.
   A statement issued in both countries and in Lome, Togo, said
Chad and Libya would ``scrupulously respect the Sept. 11, 1987
cease-fire'' that ended the fighting in northern Chad.
   The agreement, mediated by Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema, comes at a time when the mercurial Gadhafi appears to be
showing signs of some moderation, at least with regard to his
neighbors in North Africa.
   It also comes a year after Habre's forces, in a series of
lightning battles, succeeded in driving he Libyans out of northern
Chad after years of occupation in support of Chadian rebels.
   The statement did not mention the Aouzou Strip, a
44,000-square-mile band of territory across the northern border of
Chad that was seized by Libya in 1973. The Aouzou is he subject of
a dispute going back to pre-World War II days before either Chad or
Libya became independent.
   In an interview with The Associated Press last month, Gadhafi
said he was willing to negotiate the status of the Aouzou.
   ``We can negotiate,'' he said. ``It is a problem of borders. If
the United States and France get out of Chad, there is no problem.
They are using Chad for their imperialist interests.''
   The French, who have a 1,200-man intervenion force in Chad,
welcomed the diplomatic move. The French Foreign Ministry called it
a ``decision that opens the way to peace and the establishment of
neighborly relations between the Libyan and Chadian peoples.''
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said France would
consult with Chad before withdrawing the troops, all stationed in
the southern half of the country. He noted the French presence ``is
not there to stay forever,'' and could be reinforced quickly from
bases in neighboring Central African Republic.
   Some observers feel Gadhafi's less radical approach to foreign
policy lately might be the result of the influence of Omar
al-Muntasser, who became prime minister earlier this year.
   One diplomat who has followed Libyan affairs for years said
Gadhafi wants ``to give a more reasonable appearance to the outside
world'' and often has followed the advice of the more moderate
elements around him. ``He realized his image was bad,'' said the
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gadhafi re-established relations with Tunisia in December,
ending a two-year break caused when Libya expelled more than 30,000
immigrant workers, throwing them on to an already weak Tunisian
labor market.
   A document outlining a new union between Libya and Algeria is
now being discussed in both countries and is soon to be put to a
referendum.
   Libya also is participating in discussions which many hope
eventually will lead to a North African union involving Libya,
Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, known as the Maghreb, or
Arab West.
   On the home front, Gadhafi recently called for the abolition of
the death penalty, freed many political prisoners and loosened
economic restrictions.
   Gadhafi began meddling in Chadian affairs almost from the moment
he took power in 1969. He started by arming and supplying northern
rebels fighting the government in N'Djamena, and in 1973, seized
the Aouzou Strip.
   Nearly every northern Chadian leader has allied himself with
Gadhafi at one time or another, including Habre himself.
   During his brief reign from 1980 to 1982, former president
Goukouni Oueddei invited the Libyans into the country. They gladly
accepted, sending in 7,000 men. Less than two years later, however,
responding to international pressure over Gadhafi's plan to merge
Chad with Libya, Goukouni ordered the Libyans to leave, and they
withdrew to Aouzou.
   Habre ousted Goukouni in 1982, sending him fleeing to the north.
The following year, the anti-government forces began a drive on
N'Djamena.
   After Libyan troops became directly involved, the French
intervened to halt the advance. France, and to a lesser extent the
United States, have been Habre's main military and economic backers
since he seized power in 1982.

   The Voice of Lebanon radio station said
today American hostage Alann Steen could be released soon in
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut.
   ``Steen has not been released yet, but he could appear very
shortly,'' the radio said, adding the hostage was expected to
appear either at west Beirut's commercial Hamra district or in Bir
Hassan at the city's southern edge.
   At the United Nations in New York, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Al-Sharaa said one of the American hostages could be
released at ``any minute.''
   ``Now I have good news for the American people,'' he told a news
conference. ``In particular, because one of the American hostages
will be released within one hour from now. He can be released any
minute.''
   The foreign minister said the hostage would be released in
Lebanon, brought to the Syrian capital of Damascus and turned over
to U.S. officials. He said he did not known the name of the hostage.
   In Washington, President Reagan's chief spokesman said the
United States has been told by another government in the Middle
East that a hostage will be released.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to identify the country that
sent the message and would not confirm that the hostage was an
American.
   The Voice of Lebanon cited unidentified high-ranking security
sources for its brief report.
   The station is based in Christian east Beirut and speaks for the
right-wing Christian Phalange party.
   A group holding Steen and two other American professors as well
as an Indian colleague said in a statement released Saturday that
it would free one of the hostages as a goodwill gesture to the
United States.
   The group, calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine, said the release was designed to stimulate U.S. support
for the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's military
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
   The group's statement did not specify a deadline or say which
hostage would be released, but called on the families of the four
hostages to be on hand in Beirut for the release.
   That appeared to be addressed to Steen's wife Virginia-Rose, who
is vacationing with her parents in the United States. She is
expected back in Beirut Wednesday. Steen was reported ill at one
point in his captivity but the reports could not be confirmed.
   The four educators were kidnapped by gunmen posing as riot
police Jan. 24, 1987 at the campus of Beirut University College.
   Steen, 49, a native of Boston, was professor of journalism at
the university. His wife, 31, of Jackson, Mich., is a fine arts
professor at the school.
   The other three hostages the group claims to hold are: Jesse
Turner, 41, a native of Boise, Idaho, and a professor of
mathematics and computer science; Robert Polhill, 54, of New York
City, professor of business and lecturer in accounting; and
Mithileshwar Singh, 61, professor of finance and resident alien of
the United States.
   Their wives are tensely waiting for news at Badr Turner's campus
apartment.
   ``We are listening to the radios. God willing these rumors come
true. It's a good sign whoever is released,'' Mrs. Turner, a
Lebanese, said in a telephone interview.
   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy said he has no comment on the
report.
   Nine Americans are missing in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   In Clark Lake, Mich., Mrs. Steen waited by her telephone today
for news of her husband.
   ``We're just waiting and watching like everybody else ...'' she
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``There's
nothing confirmed yet.''
   Mrs. Steen said she talked to representatives of the State
Department earlier today, but she did not say what was discussed.

   Sharon Knight is developing food that is out
of this world.
   Using plastic growth chambers and carefully selected varieties,
the University of Illinois horticulturist can produce crops like
lettuce and rice faster than ordinary farmers. The quick-grown
vegetables could help feed people on 21st-century space stations,
she says.
   ``Our goal is to produce the greatest amount of products in the
shortest amount of time in the smallest space possible,'' Ms.
Knight said in a recent interview.
   Her research, begun at Purdue University in 1979, is sponsored
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. She is part
of a scientific team working on the agency's Controlled Ecological
Life Support System.
   The idea is to develop the best varieties of crops like
potatoes, soybeans, wheat, lettuce and rice to be grown on space
stations _ perhaps near the moon or Mars.
   The plants will serve two purposes. They will recycle human
waste used as fertilizer, and they will convert carbon dioxide
exhaled by the astronauts into oxygen they can breathe. The plants
also will produce the food for a nutritious vegetarian diet.
   Ms. Knight began by screening scores of lettuce varieties to
find the one that would grow the fastest and produce the most food.
Factors such as light, temperature, nutrition and atmosphere were
carefully monitored and adjusted to find the ideal combination.
   She found the best lettuce for space is Waldmann's Green.
Started from tissue culture instead of seed and grown with its
roots in nutrient solution instead of soil, the crop can be
harvested in just 19 days. She said lettuce grown in the field
takes nearly 60 days to mature.
   Ms. Knight next plans similar work with rice.
   Astronauts have visited Ms. Knight and the other researchers to
see how crops can be grown in space and to offer their suggestions.
   Since a diet of only a few vegetables could be boring, Ms.
Knight said it will be the job of food engineers to convert some of
them into tasty food bars or cakes, providing more variety in
appearance and flavor.
   But lettuce likely would be served in its natural form as a
salad because psychologically ``it will be nice to have something
green to eat,'' Ms. Knight said.
   One hundred square meters of vegetables probably would be
necessary to feed each person, she said. Computer control of the
environment and robots to help with the work are likely, she said.
   ``If there were only four people on the space station, they'd
spend all their time raising crops, so there will have to be some
automation.''
   Research remains to be done, including using natural growth
hormones to speed maturity and compensating for limited or zero
gravity, she said.
   The work also could have ``terrestrial spin-offs,'' said Ms.
Knight. ``It may lead to expansion of crops grown in
controlled-environment agriculture, especially increasing the
potential for greenhouses to be located in arctic and arid regions
of the world.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Say They Will Remain In U.S. Consualate</HEAD>

   Three prominent activists
encamped in the U.S. Consulate said in a letter published Monday
they will remain in their sanctuary to ``illustrate the pain of
detention.''
   The anti-apartheid leaders _ Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli
Moosa, leaders of the banned United Democratic Front coalition, and
Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National Education Crisis
Committee _ have been at the Johannesburg consulate since they
escaped from detention Sept. 13. Morobe and Khanyile are black,
Valli Moosa is of Indian descent.
   Each had been held more than a year without trial under the
country's state of emergency regulations.
   The South African government has said the three are free to
leave the consulate and will not be detained or restricted.
   But the activists said they do not trust the government and
repeated their call for the release of other political detainees.
   ``One newspaper editorial suggested that we should `call the
government's bluff' by walking out,'' the three said in letter
dated Sept. 28 and published Monday in the Sowetan, which covers
the main black township outside Johannesburg.
   ``We do not need to tempt the devil in order to merely prove he
is evil,'' they said. ``We really see no virtue in handing
ourselves over for another indefinite period in detention.''
   The men gave no indication of when they intended to leave the
consulate.
   ``We find no joy in spending 24 hours a day in the United States
Consulate boardroom,'' the letter said. ``However, our escape and
subsequent occupation of the consulate is meant ... to illustrate
the pain of detention which hundreds around the country suffer.'''
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without trial for
varying lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency.
About 1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most
are being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left his refuge Saturday to obtain medical treatment, his
law firm said.
   Ngcobo has filed a civil court action alleging police assaulted
him and tortured him with electric shocks during the five months he
was detained without being charged.
   The government has said Ngcobo will not be detained again, but
that he faces possible prosecution on a charge of illegal weapons
possession.

<NOTE>EDs: Top 11 grafs new with Bush, Dukakis, League statement; pick
up 8th graf pvs bgng ``The vice presidential...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, surrounded by the jubilant Discovery
crew, today proclaimed ``a great day for our country'' and Democrat
Michael Dukakis said he was thrilled by the space shuttle's
accomplishments, as the prospects for a second presidential debate
were thrown into doubt.
   The League of Women Voters, which was sponsoring the Los
Angeles-based debate, said today it was withdrawing and accused the
Bush and Dukakis campaigns of manipulating the debate preparations.
   League president Nancy Neuman told reporters in Washington that
the group refused ``to lend our trusted name to this charade.''
   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk said the bipartisan party
commission that sponsored the first debate could step into the
League's role, and he warned the Republicans not to use the
League's withdrawal as an excuse to dump the second debate. The
showdown had been scheduled Oct. 13 or 14.
   ``They may try, but I don't think they can. They are committed
to two presidential debates and the American people are well aware
of that. Even if they tried to do an end run around it, I don't
think they can get out of it,'' Kirk said.
   Bush was asked whether he would attend a debate under different
sponsorship and said, ``I can't answer a hypothetical question.''
   Bush was on hand as the astronauts landed the Discovery at
Edwards Air Force Base in California. ``Wasn't that great?'' he
said of the landing. ``It was great, a great day for our country.''
   Bush inspected the shuttle with the crew, posed for a ``thumbs
up'' photograph with the astronauts, and then saluted them.
   Dukakis interrupted his speech at the old statehouse in
Hartford, Conn., to let the crowd know the shuttle had landed
safely.
   ``America is back in space,'' the Democrat said. ``We are proud,
and we are thrilled at its achievements and the courage of that
crew.''
   Dukakis lectured elementary students in Hartford, Conn., today
on the evils of drugs and told them, ``If we are going to be the
best then we are going to have to build a very strong future.'' He
also planned to be on the hand as officials destroyed an illegal
drug cache in Detroit later today.
   The vice presidential hopefuls _ Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle _ spent the day preparing for their Wednesday
night debate in Omaha, Neb.
   Quayle, in a pre-debate interview with The Associated Press,
said that although the vice presidential encounter is important,
the determining factor for American voters is the candidate for the
White House _ and the Indiana senator will direct his attacks at
the Democratic nominee.
   ``The opponent for me is Michael Dukakis. He's the one that's
running for president,'' Quayle said. ``The senator from Texas is
the vice presidential nominee, and my target and my discussion and
my focus that evening will be on the governor from Massachusetts.''
   Meanwhile, a statewide poll in heavily-Democratic Maryland found
the two candidates in a virtual dead heat with Bush leading Dukakis
48-44 percent. The survey of 889 registered voters, conducted for
The Baltimore Sun Monday through Thursday, had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.
   The vice presidential candidates cleared their campaign
schedules to concentrate on the debate, while workers at the Civic
Auditorium in Omaha readied the hall after a performance by a
Christian rock band and an exhibition by pro wrestlers.
   The biggest task facing the crew, according to City Public
Events Manager Terry Forsberg, is decorating the candidates'
dressing rooms with carpeting and drapes.
   ``They'll look like your living room _ or better yet, theirs,''
Forsberg said.
   Quayle holed up with top advisers at an undisclosed location in
the Washington, D.C., area, and conducted mock debates with
Bentsen's stand-in, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   The Indiana senator said he was not concerned about possible
gaffes during the debate, a problem for the candidate during his
campaign appearances.
   ``The reason I'm not is because it's going to be questions and
answers. There's always that possibility, but I'm a very confident
person,'' he said.
   Republican strategists believe expectations remain low for
Quayle's performance based on his miscues and reputation as a
lightweight candidate. But the Indiana senator says he is not
giving much consideration to expectations.
   ``The American people will be able to see me in an unedited
version for the first time since New Orleans, and it's going to be
a great opportunity for me,'' he said.
   Bentsen, meanwhile, held a mock debate with Quayle stand-in,
Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, and then flew to Austin, Texas, to
devote his time to debate preparation.
   In the mock session, Eckart's attacks sent staffers scurrying
for research material, and left Bentsen a bit uncomfortable with
the debate format _ 90 minutes of questions, two-minute responses
and one-minute rebuttals.
   ``He does not seem relaxed,'' said Bentsen's spokesman Mike
McCurry. ``If it were the Senate floor he'd be very comfortable and
if it were the Senate rules he would be very comfortable.''
   Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, also downplayed
expectations for the Texas senator, an odds-on favorite based on
his experience.
   ``I have a lot of confidence in Senator Bentsen. But Dan Quayle
is a very effective debater,'' she said.

   Leftist guerrillas armed with guns
attacked an army patrol aboard a civilian bus in the southern
Amazon region, killing 13 soldiers and two civilians, the Defense
Ministry said Monday.
   In another incident in northern Colombia, guerrillas of the
National Liberation Army killed three policemen in the town of
Segovia, 190 miles north of Bogota, police said without elaborating.
   The attacks, which occurred Sunday, come after Colombia's six
rebel groups last month rejected a cease-fire and peace talks
offered by President Virgilio Barco. Some of the guerrillas
suggested the government negotiate social and economic changes,
which Barco rejected.
   The army patrol attacked in the southern state of Caqueta was
disobeying military orders by traveling on a civilian bus, the
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
   The bus, carrying about 25 soldiers and 15 civilians, was
attacked on a jungle road 40 miles south of the city of Florencia,
the ministry said.
   The rebels had placed an explosive charge on the road to stop
the bus, according to Gen. Edgar Pallares, the military governor of
Caqueta.
   In addition to those killed in the attack, 12 soldiers and five
civilians were wounded, Pallares said in the interview with the
Bogota radio station Caracol. The guerrillas who staged the bus
attack belonged to the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, he
said.
   Pallares was named governor of Caqeuta in June 1987 after
guerrillas killed 27 soldiers in an ambush.

killing all eight people on board, the Rio Airport Authority said
Monday.
   The plane, belonging to the Armar Air Taxi company, was flying
from the southeastern coastal resort town of Buzios to Rio on
Sunday when the pilot asked to make an emergency landing at the
navy air base in Sao Pedro da Aldeia, 90 miles east of Rio, the
base said.
   The plane crashed near the runway and burst into flames, killing
the six passengers and two crew members, the airport authority

   Former Watergate and Iran-Contra investigators
asked George Bush and Michael Dukakis on Monday for their views on
proposals intended to prevent lawbreaking by government officials.
   The presidential candidates were asked, for example, whether
they would agree not to appoint anyone ``who has played a leading
partisan role in the most recent presidential election campaign''
as attorney general or director of the FBI, CIA or Internal Revenue
Service.
   The group, called the Special Committee for Iran-Contra and
Watergate Reform, includes lawyers who served on various Watergate
investigative or prosecutive staffs or with the House and Senate
investigative committees on the Iran-Contra affair.
   They said their proposals were drawn from recommendations made
by the American Bar Association and by Watergate and Iran-Contra
committees and investigative staffs. The proposals are ``designed
to prevent official lawlessness and promote government
accountability.''
   The results of their questionnaire, which also will be sent to
major congressional candidates, will be published Oct. 20.
   The candidates also were asked whether they favored or opposed:
   _Extending the naming of independent counsels to investigate
members of Congress as well as high executive branch officials.
   _Presidential pardons prior to trial of individuals indicted by
an independent counsel.
   _Legislation requiring the president to sign an authorization
before any covert action is begun and requiring him to notify
appropriate members of Congress within 48 hours.
   _Legislation barring the National Security Council staff from
intelligence-gathering or covert action.
   _Public financing for congressional candidates, a limit on funds
they could accept from political action committees, and prohibiting
members of Congress from receiving honoraria if they get higher
salaries.
   The group includes Sam Dash, former chief counsel of the Senate
Watergate Committee; John W. Nields Jr., former chief counsel of
the House Iran-Contra committee, and Richard Ben-Veniste, former
chief of the Watergate prosecution task force.

   A gunman clad in camouflage shot and
wounded a third-grader on an elementary school field this morning,
authorities said.
   The girl was reported in stable condition with arm and chest
wounds.
   Police rushed to Mascotte Elementary School in this small
central Florida community, searching a heavily wooded area for the
man, said police dispatcher Cathy England.
   ``Somebody outside the fence of the school shot into the school
grounds,'' said Betty June Cofield, secretary to the Lake County
school superintendent. ``It was a man in a camouflage outfit.'' The
man had used a rifle, authorities said.
   The girl, identified as 9-year-old Leah Wilbanks of Mascotte,
was shot just before 11 a.m. as she took part in a physical
education class on the school's PE field, said Ms. Cofield.
   No one else was hurt in the incident, Ms. Cofield said. She did
not know how many shots were fired.
   The man apparently had been hiding in the brush before he jumped
up and fired, authorities said. Capt. Randy Swails of the county
sheriff's department said he had a rifle, but authorities didn't
know the exact type or caliber.
   A helicopter and a small plane were dispatched to assist in the
search, and a dog team was summoned. The school is near a heavily
wooded area, with orange groves and several lakes nearby.
   Leah was in stable condition at Orlando Regional Medical Center,
said spokeswoman Jean Lowe.
   ``She suffered two gunshot wounds to upper arm and chest. The
bullets entered and exited,'' said Ms. Lowe. The child was being
evaluated by doctors for possible surgery, she said.
   After the shooting, worried-looking parents arrived at the
school to take their children home. The school has an enrollment of
about 415.
   Jerry Kiefer of station WHOF-AM in Leesburg said Leah was the
granddaughter of the station's sales manager, Thomas Chapman.
   Mascotte, whose road signs proclaim it ``The Friendly City,''
has a population of 1,100.
   It was the third school shooting incident in as many weeks. Last
week, two little girls were killed and nine other people wounded at
a school in South Carolina, while the previous week, five people,
none of them students, were killed in a shooting in and near a
Chicago elementary school.

<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin long claimed anti-Semitism was a
purely capitalist scourge that couldn't exist under socialism.
   But the state-run press has thrown into doubt that official
tenet and even suggested there may not have been much difference
between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler on the question of
anti-Semitism.
   Soviet doctrine for decades has maintained that the overthrow of
capitalism in the 1917 Russian Revolution did away with the
economic exploitation that fosters anti-Semitism.
   One of the publications in the forefront of the ``glasnost''
campaign, the weekly Ogonyok, recently published an expose on a
grave near Minsk that contained the remains of thousands of people
shot as ``enemies of the people'' in the late 1930s under Stalin.
   Ales Adamovich, who wrote the article, said he had clashed with
another author who tried to justify the actions of Stalin's secret
police.
   ```They believed,' my opponent stressed, referring to the guards
and the watchmen whose tower loomed over the head of all 170
million people (then the Soviet population),'' Adamovich wrote.
``Well, those who committed unthinkable atrocities in occupied
Byelorussia, Ukraine, Russia and the Baltic states _ could they not
also refer to their `symbols of faith?' They could, and that's how
they justified themselves at the Nuremberg trial.''
   Another magazine, the monthly literary journal Oktyabr, in its
latest edition, printed a passage from Vitaly Grossman's novel
``Life and Fate'' about the rise of ``State anti-Semitism.''
   Oktyabr has been serializing Grossman's masterwork, a World War
II-era historical novel long banned in the Soviet Union, that
sketches parallels between wartime Russia and Nazi Germany and the
ideological tyrannies of Stalinism and Nazism.
   But reader Viktor Koretsky complained in a letter that a ``very
important'' segment had been skipped over in the serialization. The
journal's editors acknowledged that part of the novel had been
``omitted,'' but did not explain why. They then printed the missing
2{-page fragment, including these passages:
   ``In the course of two millennia, have there ever been occasions
when the forces of freedom and humanitarianism made use of
anti-Semitism as a tool in their struggles? Possibly, but I do not
know of them,'' wrote Grossman, who died in 1964.
   In contrast, he said, ``in totalitarian countries, where society
as such no longer exists, there can arise state anti-Semitism.
   ``The first stage of state anti-Semitism is discrimination: the
state limits the areas in which Jews can live,'' Grossman wrote.
``The second stage is wholesale destruction. At a time when the
forces of reaction enter a fatal struggle against the forces of
freedom, then anti-Semitism becomes an ideology of Party and State
_ as happened with Fascism.''
   Oktyabr's editors noted the segment follows chapters dealing
with Adolf Eichmann, the Gestapo official who oversaw the
annihilation of millions of Jews, and said Grossman was describing
``the racist policy and ideology of fascism _ state anti-Semitism.''
   But the passage would appear to embrace anti-Semitism in
official Soviet life as well, and in one place, it mentions
``cosmopolitanism,'' a charge used under Stalin to persecute Jewish
authors, artists and other figures after World War II.
   ``No other writer has so convincingly established the identity
of Nazism and Soviet Communism,'' said Grossman's English-language
translator Robert Chandler, in a forward to the British edition of
the novel. ``The parallels between the two systems are drawn
repeatedly...''
   Soviet officialdom had little illusion about the explosiveness
of the message contained in ``Life and Fate.'' In 1960, Grossman
completed the 800-page novel and submitted it to an official
literary journal, Znamya. It was returned with a rejection slip
calling the work ``anti-Soviet.''
   KGB officers were sent to Grossman's home with orders to
confiscate not only the manuscript, but even sheets of used carbon
paper and typewriter ribbons. When Grossman appealed to the ruling
Politburo for the return of his manuscript, Kremlin ideologue
Mikhail A. Suslov reportedly told him there would be no question of
``Life and Fate'' being published for another 200 years.
   The book has finally seen print in the Soviet Union because of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for glasnost, or greater openness,
that has brought about a more candid examination of the country's
past.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal liability trial over a 1985
Delta Air Lines crash that killed 137 people resumed Monday after
being in recess since early August.
   At stake in the non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge David
O. Belew Jr. is more than $100 million in claims from survivors and
relatives of victims. Delta is trying to have the government pay
part of the claims and the cost of replacing the Lockheed L-1011
jet destroyed in the crash of Flight 191 at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   If Belew rules that the government should share blame in the
tragedy, a separate trial will determine how much the government
should pay.
   Neither Delta nor the government disputes that a violent
downburst of air, or microburst, from a rapidly developing
thunderstorm at the edge of the runway slammed the aircraft into
the ground. Meteorologists say there is no known way to forecast a
microburst.
   Delta claims a lack of communication between government air
traffic controllers and meteorologists prevented the flight crew
from getting the information they needed on the weather.
   Government lawyers argue the flight crew had the best view of
the storm.
   The recess was to accommodate the judge's schedule.
   Delta attorneys have finished presenting their case.
   Likely upcoming witnesses for the government include Gene
Skipworth, the last flight controller to communicate with the
Flight 191 crew before the crash, government attorney Roy Krieger
said.
   Krieger said the government also plans to present pilot experts,
including an Eastern Airlines official who will testify about
Delta's pilot training programs.
   Attorneys said witnesses will be called to support the
government's contention that Capt. Edward M. Connors of the Delta
flight crew was heavily using prescription drugs about the time of
the crash.
   Delta lawyers have disputed that claim.

   Florida Democrats choose a candidate
Tuesday to oppose Republican Rep. Connie Mack III for the seat
being vacated by three-term Sen. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.
   Only about one-fourth of the state's voters are expected to show
up for the election featuring a runoff between longtime rivals Bill
Gunter, 54, and Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, 55.
   It's Gunter's third try for the Senate and the second for
MacKay, a former state legislator serving his third term in the
U.S. House.
   Gunter, Florida's insurance commissioner since 1976,
unsuccessfully sought his party's nomination in 1974. He won the
Democratic primary and runoff in 1980 before losing to Republican
Paula Hawkins in the general election.
   MacKay ran third in the 1980 primary.
   Both candidates engaged in negative campaigning to such an
extent that state Democratic Chairman Charles Whitehead said it
could cost the party the Senate seat being vacated by Chiles after
18 years.
   ``I certainly think, what with what has gone on in the primary,
it's going to make a tougher race for us to win than I would have
liked to have had,'' said Whitehead.
   MacKay has made personal integrity an issue, pointing to
Gunter's taking campaign contributions from the industry he
regulates, and saying a 1986 FBI investigation cast a shadow over
Gunter's performance as commissioner. Gunter says the investigation
exonerated him.
   In a state with a large Jewish population, Gunter has questioned
MacKay's support for Israel. MacKay has angrily depicted this as
part of a whispering campaign unjustly accusing him of
anti-Semitism.
   Both campaigns said the race was close.
   Dot Joyce of the Florida Division of Elections predicted an
overall turnout of 25 percent as voters choose party candidates to
run for a variety of other posts, including insurance commissioner,
secretary of state, and federal and state House races.
   There are three U.S. House runoffs, all among Republicans.
   L.A. ``Skip'' Bafalis and former Lee County Commissioner Porter
Goss seek the GOP nomination in the 14th District, where Mack has
given up the seat once held by Bafalis to run for the Senate.
   The GOP runoff victor faces Democrat Jack Conway, a retiree who
was the first national president of Common Cause, a government
watchdog group, and a longtime civil rights activist.
   Clifford Stearns, an Ocala hotel and restaurant operator, meets
Jim Cherry of Turkey Creek, former head of the state Farmers Home
Administration, in the 6th District Republican race.
   The winner will face Democratic state legislative veteran Jon
Mills of Gainesville in the general election battle to succeed
MacKay.
   In the 11th District, Republicans will select Bill Tolley of
Melbourne or Rod Borum of Indialantic to face five-term incumbent
Bill Nelson, who plans to run for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination in 1990.

<HEAD>Medicare Excess Billings Hit $2.7 Billion, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors who charge higher fees than the
federal government considers reasonable billed their Medicare
patients $2.7 billion for the additional charges last year, a
statistical analysis showed Monday.
   That was spread among 70.3 million physician claims _ roughly
one-fourth of all submitted to Medicare in fiscal 1987 _ and
averaged $38.11 in extra charges per billing.
   Medicare beneficiaries are required to pay 20 percent of the
amount Medicare deems reasonable, and those co-payments amounted to
$25.99 for each of the 70.3 million claims that also contained what
Medicare calls ``excess billing.''
   Adding the average Medicare co-payment to the average excess
charge resulted in an average out-of-pocket expense of $64.11 for
each of the patient bills that exceeded the Medicare standard.
   The excess-billing claims came from the 63 percent of the
nation's doctors who have not agreed to abide by the fee schedules
set by Medicare.
   The percentage of claims with excess charges ranged from 3
percent in Massachusetts, where state law forbids excess billing,
to 51 percent in Wyoming.
   Although federal health officials and Congress have instituted a
series of programs designed to encourage doctors to follow the
Medicare scale, there is no national rule requiring them to do so.
   The percentage of physicians who voluntarily follow the Medicare
fee schedule ranges from 73.5 percent in Alabama to 14.9 percent in
Idaho.
   Despite the state law keeping doctors from collecting excess
charges from their Medicare patients, only 45.9 percent of
Massachusetts doctors have voluntarily agreed to be listed on
Medicare's roster of ``participating physicians'' who ``accept
assignment.''
   A physician who ``accepts assignment'' charges only the fee that
Medicare deems reasonable and proper, considering his or her bill
fully paid after collecting 20 percent from the patient and 80
percent from Medicare.
   ``With physician net income 10 times that of the elderly, it's
not too much to ask that all doctors accept the rates Medicare sets
for reimbursement as full payment from all Medicare patients,''
said Robert M. Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, a
consumer group that released the study.
   ``That's why we support national legislation prohibiting excess
charges. Voluntary efforts on the federal and state levels have not
worked well enough, even when they have included incentives.''
   Citizen Action, which claims 1.7 million members, based its
survey on records maintained by the Health Care and Financing
Administration, the agency that manages Medicare. Fiscal 1987 was
the last year for which full statistics are available. Fiscal 1988
ended only last Friday and all the bills are not in for the most
recent 12-month federal budget year.
   The Citizen Action analysis showed that the doctors who treat
Medicare patients received an average income of about $60,000 in
fiscal 1987 just from those patients. That included the 80 percent
paid by Medicare and the enrollee's 20 percent share of
``reasonable charges.''
   ``Doctors who are not participating physicians (those who can
bill patients excess charges) receive, on average, an additional
$7,400 per year in excess charges to seniors,'' the study said.

<HEAD>Labor Party Conference Agrees To Tone Down Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual conference of the
opposition Labor Party endorsed on Monday key proposals to tone
down left-wing policies in a bid to end nearly a decade of
Conservative Party government.
   Leftists, already soundly defeated in a bid to oust Labor leader
Neil Kinnock, accused him of ditching cherished socialist
principles after three successive election defeats by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The review, the first stage of a two-year process, includes
dropping a commitment to renationalize all state-owned industries
sold by Mrs. Thatcher and also accepts some of her drastic curbs on
the powers of labor unions.
   ``We don't have to cling to the past, terrified to move,''
Labor's election campaign manager, Bryan Gould, told more than
1,000 delegates at the Winter Gardens conference center in this
north England resort.
   ``There is a bright socialist future for this party and this
country if only we have the courage to think for it,'' Gould said.
   A succession of left-wing speakers denounced the policy review
document, ``Social Justice and Economic Efficiency,'' which
stresses the role of capitalism while promising greater state
control of the economy.
   To cheers from supporters, miners' leader Arthur Scargill, a
pro-Marxist, said the new policies were ``a clear departure from
the basic principles and traditions of our party.''
   ``I didn't join this party to have a yuppieland approach, to run
capitalism better than the Tories,'' said Scargill. ``I joined this
party to change this society and create a socialist alternative.''
   Delegate Matt Wrack described the document as a ``pompous,
self-important, mendacious load of drivel.''
   Kinnock ordered the review after Labor's last election defeat in
1987.
   The new proposals, released last spring, also stipulate tax rate
ceilings of 50 percent to 60 percent, compared with 86 percent
under the last Labor administration, which lost power in 1979.
   The proposals are the first stage of a two-year process. The
rest of the review, including the party's controversial pledge to
scrap nuclear weapons unilaterally, is due to be published next
spring, with final decisions made on the whole package at Labor's
1989 convention.
   The next election must be held by 1992, but it is likely in 1991.
   Labor's constitution still has a basic Marxist-style tenet
adopted in 1918, which calls for ``common ownership of the means of
production, distribution and exchange.'' Kinnock and his top aides
insist that a mixed economy of private and state control does not
conflict with the tenet, known as Clause 4.
   Under the new policies, a Labor government would only
nationalize giant utilities, such as British Gas, sold by Mrs.
Thatcher. She plans also to sell the national electricity utility.
   But the rest, which include British Airways, a national freight
service, Jaguar cars and the state's remaining share in British
Petroleum, would be left in private hands. One in seven voters has
bought shares in the big Tory government sales alone.
   Kinnock plans to use his resounding defeat of a leadership
challenge by leftist Tony Benn as a mandate to press on with what
he calls a party platform based on ``realism.''
   In a ballot Sunday night, Kinnock won 88 percent support from an
electoal college consisting of labor union leaders, the party's 228
members in the 650-seat House of Commons, and local party branches.
   The Labor Party was founded by the trade unions at the turn of
the century and they continue to fund it. Benn pledged to fight on
and maintained Kinnock's tactics would not win the next election.

   Here is a state-by-state breakdown of
government statistics on fiscal 1987 physician charges to Medicare
beneficiaries in excess of what the government considered
reasonable and proper. The data was compiled by Citizen Action from
records of the Health Care Financing Administration.
   The first figure for each state is the actual amount of excess
charges paid. Second is the number of claims with excess charges.
Third is the percentage of claims with excess charges. Fourth is
the state ranking, based on percentage of claims with excess
charges. Fifth is the average excess charge per claim. The last two
figures are the percentage of physicians who have agreed to abide
by fee schedules set by Medicare based on 1988 figures, followed by
the state's ranking based on that percentage.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians sought agreement Monday on a measure to
limit secret voting in Parliament in a bid to stave off a possible
government crisis.
   A vote is expected in the Chamber of Deputies later this week,
and political analysts said Premier Ciriaco De Mita's 6-month-old
coalition government hangs in the balance.
   Since the vote itself will be secret, politicians see the
possibility of ``snipers'' _ those who vote against their own party
_ as being a determining factor.
   ``If the proposal is rejected there is no doubt Mr. De Mita will
resign,'' said Francesco D'Onofrio, a constitutional expert for De
Mita's Christian Democrat Party.
   Italy is one of the few Western democracies where most
parliamentary votes are secret and roll-calls are taken only on
votes of confidence. The practice has been blamed in part for the
chronic instability of Italian governments.
   De Mita's predecessor, fellow Christian Democrat Giovanni Goria,
resigned as head of Italy's 47th postwar government in March after
losing a series of secret votes. His seven months in office were
plagued by political infighting.
   The same five parties that had made up Goria's government agreed
in April to reform the coalition under De Mita by placing limits on
the secret ballot.
   They agreed the secrecy would only be retained for questions
involving fundamental liberties or for issues of conscience such as
genetic manipulation or abortion. But some members of Parliament
have had second thoughts, viewing the secret vote as the only way
to keep some degree of freedom from the tight party discipline.
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, a powerful Christian
Democrat, took some distance from De Mita last week when he said
Parliament ``shouldn't exaggerate'' any changes and should consider
limiting open voting to financial questions.
   A series of amendments to limit open voting have been tacked on
to the original coalition government proposal, and the Chamber of
Deputies will vote on these.
   Mario Usellini, a Christian Democrat, said in a newspaper
interview that about 10 percent of the 630 members of the Chamber
of Deputies are inclined to break party discipline but would be
afraid to do so if most votes were open.
   ``They are deputies with a weak position in their party and feel
most exposed because they fear expulsion (from the party) and an
electoral boycott,'' he told Milan's Corriere della Sera.
   The secret vote also is believed to help special interests,
since no voting records can be kept.

<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators have found 140 more wild
horses apparently fatally shot in remote central Nevada, bringing
to 268 the number found dead in the area, the Bureau of Land
Management said Monday.
   The horses were discovered about 10 miles north of a site where
authorities had found 41 horses slain and 40 miles north of an area
where 87 horses had been shot, said Bob Stewart, a spokesman for
the federal agency.
   In all three cases, Stewart said the carcasses and bones
indicate the horses died over a six-month period starting about a
year ago.
   And while BLM investigators haven't stated yet that the earlier
shootings and the latest deaths are connected, ``I'd be surprised
if there's not a connection,'' Stewart said.
   Stewart added he didn't know if there was any link between the
central Nevada horse killings and reported shootings of several
wild horses at Silverpeak in southern Nevada.
   The Bureau of Land Management has increased surveillance of the
rangeland it controls in Nevada following the discovery in August
of the 41 slain horses. The second group of horses was found after
the agency got a tip from an unidentified person being questioned
about the first killings.
   A helicopter crew made the latest find in an area about 30 miles
north of Austin, and ground crews were to go to the isolated area
to confirm the cause of death, Stewart said.
   Terri Jay, director of the Nevada Commission for the
Preservation of wild Horses, has said rewards totaling $12,000 are
being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone involved in the shootings.
   More than 38,000 wild horses run the open range of 10 western
states, up from about 17,000 when Congress decided in 1971 to make
it a crime to harrass or kill wild horses on public lands.
   Nevada's wild horse herds are among the largest in the West,
with estimates of up to 28,000 of the animals roaming the state.
   At the turn of the century, there were some 2 million wild
horses in the West, but they were relentlessly hunted and
slaughtered for pet food and glue.

   The decision by Vice
President George Bush to watch the Discovery landing prompted
officials on Monday to move the viewing site for relatives of the
astronauts, a NASA spokesman said.
   A 20-foot-high platform usually set aside for families to watch
was instead provided for the vice president. Bush took time out
from his presidential campaign to attend Monday's shuttle landing
in what was described by his staff as an official function.
   The platform, which sits on the lake bed where the shuttle
lands, has steps leading up to a flat wooden area on top that is
surrounded by a railing.
   During early shuttle landings, the platform was reserved for
President Reagan, said Ralph Jackson, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Reagan attended the fourth
landing on July 4, 1982.
   ``They (the astronauts' families) are in a better viewing
spot,'' Jackson said. ``They were moved, but it was no
inconvenience to them. Actually, they are closer and in a better
viewing position.''

   One of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon
will be freed later today and handed over to the U.S. ambassador to
Syria, the Syrian foreign minister said.
   The foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, told a midday news
conference at the United Nations he had ``good news for the
American people. ...
   ``One of the American hostages will be released within one hour
from now. He can be released any minute.''
   He spoke shortly after 1 p.m. EDT. There had been no report of
any hostage freed as of two hours later.
   Kidnappers holding three American professors and one Indian
educator said today they will free one hostage at the west Beirut
headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian
refugees.
   The announcement from Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine came in a 36-word handwritten statement in Arabic
delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.
   The Syrian foreign minister said the hostage, whose name he said
he did not know, ``will be released in Lebanon, where he was
kidnapped, and the Syrian security forces will bring him to
Damascus to hand him over to the American ambassador.
   NBC News and CBS News and, in Beirut, the Voice of Lebanon radio
station reported that Alann Steen, 49, of Boston, was being
released. State Department officials said they could not confirm
the report.
   Steen's wife, Virginia, told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview that she had talked with the State Department hours
earlier.
   ``We're just waiting and watching like everybody else. ...
There's nothing confirmed yet,'' she said.
   President Reagan, asked during a picture-taking session if he
thought a hostage was about to be released, replied:
   ``It's hard to tell with what little information we have. As far
as we know, no hostages has been released yet. We have no word on
that.''
   Earlier, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States had been told by another government that a hostage held by
Iranian sympathizers was being released imminently.
   Fitzwater said U.S. government officials ``received reports''
this morning that a hostage would be set free, and said that the
reports came from a ``third-party government in the region.''
   At the State Department, an official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the latest report came from the Islamic Jihad
through the Syrian government.
   He said that was the group holding four American educators and
any release was likely to come from those four hostages. A total of
nine Americans are held hostage in Lebanon.
   The four educators believed held by Islamic Jihad, all captured
Jan. 24, 1987, are:
   Steen, a journalism professor at Beirut University College;
Jesse Turner, a visiting professor at the school; Robert Pohill, an
assistant business professor, and Mithileswar Singh, an Indian
citizen holding resident alien status in the United States.
   Nearly four months after they were taken captive, Turner said in
a videotape released by Islamic Jihad that Steen was suffering from
high blood pressure, was in ``pitiful'' health and was expected to
die at any moment despite being under a doctor's care.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said, ``We have received reports
that a hostage would be released,'' the presidential spokesman
said. ``But we have not received a name, and I cannot comment any
further.'' He said he did not know if the hostage purportedly to be
released is an American.
   During his daily White House news briefing, Fitzwater said the
tip off to a hostage release was relayed to U.S. officials in
Washington by an American embassy overseas.
   Last Friday, Reagan, while on a campaign trip to Chicago, denied
that the administration was steeped in negotiations with Iranian
officials in Geneva aimed at securing the release of at least five
American hostages by Oct. 7, as a report published in Israel held.
   Earlier in the week, however, the president, during a meeting in
New York with representatives of Persian Gulf states, told
reporters he was optimistic about the hostage situation. He also
said, however, that he didn't want to talk about it.
   In Beirut on Saturday, kidnappers holding three American
educators and an Indian professor said they would release one
hostage as a goodwill gesture.
   The group, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free,
or when.
   Fitzwater said, ``Our situation is the same. Our policy is the
same. No deals. No quid pro quos.''
   ``First of all, we need to wait and see that it does happen,''
he said, noting that ``we have had some similar kinds of reports in
the past ... that fell through. ... There is a concern, in the
sense that we don't know what their motives are in any of these
actions.''
   In an interview published today, the spiritual leader of an
umbrella group for kidnappers holding foreign hostages said he
thought the problem was nearing an end.
   ``When the hostage question shifts to high-level talks between
big powers, and they start speaking of deadlines, that means the
question is nearing its end,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
spiritual head of Hezbollah, was quoted as saying in the weekly
Monday Morning magazine.
   The Christian al-Markazia news agency carried advance excerpts
of the interview on Sunday.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella group
for kidnappers holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Besides the four taken prisoner in January 1987, these Americans
are also held hostage in Lebanon:
   _Thomas Sutherland, the dean of agriculture at the American
University in Beirut. He was taken prisoner June 9, 1885; Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
   _Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller of the university,
captured Sept. 12, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice Organization
said it took Cicippio prisoner.
   _Terry Anderson, chief Mideastern correspondent of The
Associated Press, captured March 16, 1985. Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility.
   _Frank Herbert Reed, director of the private Lebanon
International School, taken prisoner Sept. 9, 1986. The pro-Libyan
Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Moukhtar Forces took responsibility.
   _Edward Austin Tracy, a children's book author. He was captured
Oct. 21, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice Organization said he was
its prisoner.
   _Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, captured Feb. 17, 1988, in
a kidnapping claimed by the Oranigzaion of the Oppressed on Earth.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen tossed a football
and declared himself relaxed and ready Monday for his vice
presidential debate with Republican Dan Quayle.
   ``We'll talk about the issues, those that are facing America,
and get away from some of these slogans,'' the Texas senator told
reporters during a break outside the hotel where he is preparing
for the Wednesday night confrontation in Omaha, Neb.
   Formal rehearsals for the debate were being videotaped in an
empty restaurant next door to Bentsen's hotel. Campaign aides set
up two lecterns, a table for the panelists and a dark backdrop to
duplicate debate conditions, with Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio,
playing the role of Quayle.
   Bentsen scheduled no campaign events until Tuesday, when he will
attend a rally before he flies to Omaha. His only public appearance
Monday was when he emerged from his hotel for a game of catch
football with former University of Texas players who included 1969
quarterback James Street.
   ``I think we're relaxed for it. I think we're ready for it,''
Bentsen said. Was he nervous? ``I'm not nervous,'' he said.
   Bentsen, 67, joked about the differences in age and physical
appearance between himself and the telegenic Quayle, 41.
   He said that when Michael Dukakis asked him to join the
Democratic ticket, he quipped to his wife, B.A., ``I hope he
doesn't just want another pretty face.''
   ``She said, `Lloyd, dream on, dream on','' he said.
   Bentsen spent the morning in meetings with a dozen aides before
he headed to the mock-debate studio in the afternoon. His advisers
included people from his Texas entourage and Dukakis' campaign
headquarters.
   ``I think he's obviously going to be well-prepared for this
experience,'' said George Christian, former press secretary to
President Johnson and a longtime Bentsen associate.
   ``Most people have already decided that Bentsen is more
qualified than Quayle, and I don't really believe that is the issue
of this debate,'' he said.
   ``I don't think this is going to be Quayle-bashing debate,''
Christian said, adding that he expected Quayle to perform well.
Instead, he said, Bentsen needed to attack Republican distortions
of such issues as crime and gun control.
   ``The Bush campaign has used a campaign of distortion to attempt
to paint Gov. Dukakis as a wild-eyed Northeastern liberal, and here
in Texas that has hurt,'' Christian said. ``Sen. Bentsen is one of
the better Democrats available to answer that sort of thing.''
   Texas has 29 electoral votes, third highest of any state, and
despite Bentsen's presence on the ticket the Democrats are trailing
in the polls.
   Susan Estrich, the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign manager, said the
staff was trying to help Bentsen express his achievements and
experience in concise ways that fit the format of the 90-minute
debate.
   ``I think he's in very good shape,'' she said.
   Estrich said it would not be fatal to the Democrats if Bentsen
fared poorly against Quayle.
   ``There are no make-or-break occasions in this campaign. There
are no do-or-die days,'' she said. ``We think we have five weeks to
convince the American people that this is the team for our future
and we're in a tough and competitive race.''

   A crowd of 425,000 people
_ the second-largest ever to watch a space shuttle land _ cheered
proudly Monday as Discovery dropped from a deep-blue desert sky and
gently touched down on a dusty lake bed.
   About 410,000 people had funneled cars, motor homes, trailers
and trucks down a two-lane road to a public viewing area to witness
the completion of the first shuttle mission since Challenger
exploded 32 months ago. An additional 15,000 watched from a VIP
viewing area.
   ``It sends chills up my spine,'' 26-year-old Steve Bestwick of
Port Hueneme said as two sonic booms reverberated across Rogers Dry
Lake at 9:34 a.m., three minutes before the touchdown.
   Then the gleaming white-over-black Discovery appeared from the
west and made a fast turn high overhead.
   Bestwick marveled at how quickly it plummeted to the hard-packed
floor of the Mojave Desert.
   ``That's beautiful, but geez, it's so steep,'' he said.
   ``I had goosebumps all over,'' said Diane Bonds, who traveled
600 miles from Roy, Utah. ``I have always wanted to see one of
these and now I have.''
   The vehicles, many displaying American flags, started gathering
Sunday beside the 44-square-mile lake bed in the Mojave Desert 80
miles north of Los Angeles. Some had license pates from states as
distant as Florida.
   Most of the shuttle watchers felt Discovery's safe return would
reinvigorate America's manned space program, which had been
virtually paralyzed following the Challenger disaster.
   ``I certainly hope it does,'' said Betty Davis, 66, of Goleta.
``We need to spend our money on this. It's exciting and patriotic.''
   After the landing, most viewers sprinted for their vehicles,
which threw a huge cloud of talcum powder-like dust into the air as
they crowded toward the single exit gate out of the parking area.
   The two-lane blacktop highway is the only road leading away from
the viewing site.
   Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. George Neiss said 109,000 vehicles
carried an estimated 410,000 people to the public viewing site by
Monday morning.
   Only one larger crowd had ever gathered to watch a shuttle land:
an estimated 500,000 for the shuttle Columbia on July 4, 1982, when
President and Mrs. Reagan greeted the astronauts.
   Ellery Sabin, 66, who had traveled from Ludington, Mich.,
perched atop his 33-foot motor home and surveyed the recreational
vehicles, tents, cars and trucks stretching across the desert
dotted with bizarrely twisted Joshua trees.
   ``This is crazy,'' he exclaimed. ``I've been around crowds, but
this is really something.
   ``There's such a sense of pride here,'' Sabin said. ``We need to
continue with the space program. I don't like to see them throw
taxpayer money away on a lot of things, but this is certainly worth
it.''

<TEXT>
   As flood waters receded Monday,
authorities intensified relief operations in four states in
northern India, where at least 462 people have died in nearly two
weeks of flooding.
   In the city of Bombay in western India, torrential rains killed
at least 14 people on Monday, Indian news agencies reported.
   Roads and rail communications in the city were cut off after the
heaviest rainfall in a day for three decades was recorded Monday,
news agencies said without giving the amount in inches.
   The government said 462 people have been killed in the floods,
which on Sept. 22 struck the northern states of Punjab, Haryana,
Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.
   News reports said the floods claimed as many as 800 lives.
   Sidharta S. Ray, governor of Punjab, said the area's three major
rivers _ the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi _ had receded below the danger
level, allowing workers to step up relief efforts.
   More than 250,000 people were evacuated from 1,650 villages that
are still cut off by water, Ray told reporters. More than 140,000
people have left their homes and were accommodated in 242 relief
camps, he said.
   Ray said 142 people are still reported missing in Punjab, the
area worst hit by the floods.
   Relief workers used boats to try to rescue trapped villagers,
officials said. Helicopters dropped food supplies into flooded
areas, and Indian air force transport planes delivered fuel into
areas where road and rail services were cut off.
   Officials were still trying to determine the extent of crop
damage in Punjab, which produces about half the country's wheat and
rice.
   Floods frequently batter the subcontinent during the summer
monsoon rains, which begin in late June and last through September.

   Authorities said Monday they retrieved
most of a bomb that killed a 9-year-old boy and injured five other
children but said they haven't learned the origins of what the
children called a ``big firecracker.''
   Until laboratory tests are complete, probably later this week,
no further information about the Sunday night explosion will be
disclosed, said Lou Iliano, resident agent of the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The explosion killed Max Herrera and injured his brother and
sister and three other children, all ages 4 to 11, in a south Fort
Worth neighborhood.
   The children were playing with the ``large and volatile'' pipe
bomb when it detonated, said David Carr, fire department district
chief.
   ``We've heard the kids were passing it around, trying to light
it with matches,'' he said. ``They had it in their hands. Whether
they lit it or not, we don't know. ... They were playing with it,
but we can't be sure at this time where it came from.''
   However, the dead boy's older sister, Rosie Arredonda, 24, told
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, ``some kid gave Max the bomb. Max lit
it and it went up.''
   Ms. Arredonda said the Herrera children had accompanied their
mother to a grocery store a block away, but left the store to play
with their friends.
   The children were playing with some type of pipe and some
matches, and at one point, a woman took the device away from the
children, witnesses said.
   The blast spewed fragments of the bomb as far as 150 feet,
although nerly 75 percent of it remained intact, Carr said.
   ``We've got the whole (bomb),'' Iliano said. ``I was surprised
at how much there was left.''

   Heavy storms sent torrents of rainwater and
mud into the streets and highways of this southern city Monday,
killing eight people, cutting off road and rail traffic and
disrupting phone links, authorities said.
   Officials at the regional prefecture in Montpellier said all
highways leading to the city of 130,000 were blocked and urged
people not to try to drive there. The flood waters also stopped all
trains to Nimes, 440 miles south of Paris, which is known for its
large and well-preserved Roman arena.
   In Paris, the Interior Ministry said eight people had died in
the flooding and said Interior Minister Pierre Joxe went to visit
the disaster scene.
   Officials said six helicopters evacuated more than 100 people
stranded by the high water. More than 6 inches of rain fell on
Nimes in 36 hours.
   Up to five feet of water covered downtown streets Monday,
swamping cars and trucks before the levels began to subside in the
afternoon.

<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted racketeer was sentenced Monday
to 20 years in prison for his involvement in a network of massage
parlors that were transformed into houses of prostitution.
   The trial turned over a lot of rocks in the quiet community and
shocked many residents.
   William J. Evers, 49, will be eligible for parole in seven
years. He faced a maxiumum of 313 years in prison.
   Outagamie County Circuit Judge Dennis Luebke, who gave Evers
credit for 18 months of pre-sentence confinement, criticized him
for continuing to be involved in the massage parlor business after
being sentenced to prison on related charges.
   At a preliminary hearing, a judge blamed the community for the
prostitution problem.
   ``None of it would have been possible without the patronage of
the people of the Fox River Valley,'' Reserve Judge Albert Twesme
of Galesville said. ``They are the ones who made all this
despicable behavior possible. It was they who made these activities
lucrative.''
   Twesme said he had been shocked by testimony that some of the
prostitutes were busiest after Sunday church services.
   Reading from a statement prior to sentencing, Evers said he
regretted his actions for the past five years, especially their
impact on his wife, Anita.
   ``I apologize to the court, the community and especially my
family,'' he said.
   ``There's no doubt that Mr. Evers is a man of great
intelligence, a natural born leader of people. He views himself as
a superior human being; a player that dictates to society and
individuals that are weaker than himself,'' Prosecutor John Des
Jardins said.
   Des Jardins said rehabilitation was ``an impossibility for Mr.
Evers at this point. In effect it almost becomes a hobby for Mr.
Evers to try to outwit society.''
   On July 23, a jury convicted Evers of 23 felony charges and one
misdemeanor.
   Evers was convicted of three counts of racketeering, two counts
of allowing the continued use of a place of prostitution, 18 counts
of establishing a person in a place of prostitution, and one count
of misdemeanor theft.
   He was found innocent of 11 counts of causing a person to
practice prostitution and one count of soliciting a person to
practice prostitution.

   It's back to Beijing for Ling Ling, the giant
panda who delighted American audiences for nearly a year.
   Thousands of fans turned out Sunday for his last day on display
at Busch Gardens. The panda, on loan since November, returns
Tuesday to the People's Republic of China.
   ``He's been a real bright spot for us,'' said Terri Pereira, who
has a yearlong park pass and said her family has made weekly

   ``It's a gut-wrenching feeling,'' said Walt Johnson, one of the

bamboo. ``This'll be my last day with him.''
   Ling Ling was originally displayed with Yong Yong, an older
female panda who was returned to the Beijing Zoo in April.

<HEAD>13 Reported Killed In Rocket Attack On Afghan City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired rockets into
the Afghan city of Kandahar that killed 13 people, Radio Kabul
reported Monday.
   The radio said a military correspondent with the official Afghan
Bakhtar news agency said another 22 people were injured in the
attack on residential areas of the southern city over the weekend.
   Soviet troops left Kandahar on Aug. 15 as part of the withdrawal
of an estimated 100,000 Red Army soldiers under an accord signed in
Geneva. The pullout of the troops, which invaded Afghanistan in
1979 to support the Marxist government, is to be completed by Feb.
15.
   Both the Soviets and the Afghans have accused Pakistan of
violating the Geneva agreement by harboring and arming Moslem
guerrillas.
   Pakistan has charged the Soviet-backed Afghan government with
violating its airspace more than 150 times since the May 15 accord
was signed.
   Radio Kabul said the Afghan government filed a complaint with
Pakistan's representative in Kabul, charging Pakistan with
supporting a guerrilla attack on Asadabad in the northeastern
province of Kunar. Eight people died in that attack, which Radio
Kabul said occurred on Friday.
   In another development, a Japanese free-lance photographer was
killed over the weekend by a mine on a road in eastern Afghanistan
where Moslem guerrillas and government troops were fighting, rebels
reported.
   The woman, identified as Naoko Nanjo, 30, was covering a
guerrilla operation on the road between Kabul and the city of
Jalalabad, 75 miles from the Pakistan border, the rebels said
Sunday.
   Japanese Embassy officials in Islamabad said they also had
received the report but were unable to confirm it.
   If correct, Ms. Nanjo would be at least the sixth Western
journalist killed while covering the 9-year-old war between Moslem
insurgents and Soviet-backed Afghan government troops.
   During the weekend operation, the guerrillas captured seven army
posts along a 21 mile stretch of the highway, killing 39 troops and
capturing 12. Two guerrillas were killed and five were wounded, the
spokesman said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending fell 0.6 percent in
August, the government said Monday, and economists blamed the
lackluster performance on rising interest rates and previous
overbuilding in many regions.
   The Commerce Department said building activity declined to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $396.1 billion in August,
following a revised 0.7 percent gain in July. The July figure had
been preliminarily reported as a strong 1.2 percent gain.
   For the first eight months of the year, activity was up only 0.4
percent over the same period in 1987, failing even to keep pace
with the 1.4 percent increase in construction costs.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist in Washington who publishes a
construction newsletter, cited five reasons for the sluggishness:
rising interest rates, the effects of the 1986 tax law, high land
prices, a no-growth movement on the West Coast and the lack of
public spending on sewerage, water systems and other public works
needed to support building.
   Despite rising interest rates in August, strength in housing,
particularly single-family homes, partly offset weakness in most
other areas.
   Residential construction overall was up 0.7 percent to $190.8
billion, bolstered by a 1.0 percent jump in construction of
single-family units to $115.6 billion and a 0.5 percent rise in
apartment construction to $22.0 billion.
   Construction of commercial buildings including shopping centers
was down 6.0 percent to $26.8 billion in August.
   Factory construction dropped for the third consecutive month. It
fell 3.1 percent to the lowest level since April 1987. Activity in
this sector had been rising earlier this year as manufacturers
increased capacity to meet a boom in export sales.
   Government construction projects fell 2.1 percent to $77.5
billion and included a 12.7 percent drop in highway construction.
   Construction of office buildings in August rose 0.4 percent to
$28.1 billion.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said demand for office space in the Northeast and the
Washington, D.C., area is somewhat offsetting the lack of activity
in states such as Texas, where many now-vacant office buildings
were constructed based on the assumption that oil prices would stay
high.
   Hotel and motel construction was up 3.0 percent to $6.7 billion.

<TEXT>
   The financial health of the nation's hospitals is
taking a turn for the worse, which could lead to more hospital
closings and a decline in the quality of patient care, an industry
group said Monday.
   The main cause of the hospitals' financial woes is
less-than-adequate payments under government Medicare and Medicaid
programs, said the Healthcare Financial Management Association,
citing a survey of 1,400 hospitals. There are about 7,000 hospitals
in the country.
   ``The first thing we need is to have a payment policy for
Medicaid and Medicare services that is rational,'' said association
President Richard L. Clarke. ``We feel that it is currently unfair
to hospitals.''
   ``We believe government and employers must ... make decisions
for payment of health care services which meet the financial needs
of hospitals that conscientiously manage their costs,'' he said.
   Under changes that took effect in October 1983, Medicare pays a
set amount for a given service or treatment. The schedule was set
by Congress in an effort to curb sharply escalating healthcare
costs and reduce federal budget deficits.
   Clarke said that move has resulted in more patients being
treated at outpatient clinics and walk-in surgical centers, and a
decline in hospital occupancy rates.
   ``I think what we'll find in the future is that more hospitals
will close, others will eliminate unprofitable services such as
emergency rooms, and others will have no ability to borrow money to
replace aging plant and equipment,'' said Clarke.
   The organization for financial managers of hospitals and other
businesses in the health-care field has 26,000 members.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Health Care Finance Administration,
which administers the Medicare government-insurance program used
primarily by senior citizens, declined to comment specifically on
the report, saying he had not seen it.
   But spokesman Robert Hardy said Medicare payment rates for
hospitals are ``fair and realistic.''
   There were rate increases of 2.9 percent to 3.9 percent on Oct.
1, he said, noting the boosts varied depending on location.
   ``Basically, Medicare was put into business not to make sure
that every country in the hospital makes a profit ... but to make
sure that senior citiizens get quality health care,'' Hardy said.
   He suggested a major factor in hospitals' financial problems is
too many beds, citing nationwide occupancy rates averaging only
about 60 percent.
   Clarke acknowledged a nationwide surplus of hospital beds.
   But he said hospitals that ``will be forced out of business for
purely financial reasons are probably the ones needed most _ in
poorer sections of urban areas ... and in rural areas.''
   Last year, a record 79 hospitals closed around the country, half
in inner cities and half in rural areas, according to the American
Hospital Association. Forty-nine hospitals closed in 1985 and 71 in
1986.
   Profit margins among the hospitals surveyed fell from 2.9
percent in 1986 to 2.4 percent in 1987, a decline of 17.2 percent,
according to the association's Hospital Industry Financial Report
for 1983-87.
   The study said Standard and Poors reports during the past five
years show that 22 percent of all hospital credit ratings have been
lowered, while 5 percent have been raised.
   Unless the financial trend is reversed, hospitals could be
``hard pressed to meet the health care needs of the future'' and
there could be an overall decline in the quality of patient care,
Clarke said.

<HEAD>Drivers Take To Picket Lines In Dispute With Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drivers who haul stars, equipment and
props for television and movie producers went on strike Monday, the
second time this year the entertainment industry has been strained
by a labor dispute.
   Unions representing electricians and laborers also authorized
strikes against producers on Monday, said Earl Bush,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 399. He estimated about
3,200 workers were on strike.
   Producers, stung already by a 22-week strike by scriptwriters
that ended in August, vowed their movie and television production
schedules would not be disrupted again and hired replacement
drivers. No new talks were scheduled.
   The Hollywood plumbers and plasterers unions did not join the
protest. And Hollywood's talent unions _ actors, writers and
directors _ have contract clauses that forbid them from honoring
the picket lines of other unions.
   Teamsters were hoping that drivers who belong to locals that
aren't striking the producers would still honor picket lines and
refrain from making deliveries to studios.
   The strike was called after weekend negotiations, which were
ordered by a federal mediator, collapsed. The union voted 1,441-196
on Thursday to reject the contract proposal submitted by the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   Key issues dividing the two sides include overtime rules for
weekend work, salary rates, wages for out-of-town film and
television production and guidelines for making non-union films.
Some Teamster drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61
to $14 per hour.
   About two dozen pickets marched Monday in front of the Hollywood
Boulevard offices of producer Stephen J. Cannell. Drivers also
picketed the Cannell production ``Hunter.'' The NBC-TV show was
shooting on location at the Santa Monica Pier.
   Bush blamed the producers for the impasse.
   ``We have attempted to cooperate every way possible not to have
a strike,'' he said. ``Can we stop production? I guess that's
something we're going to have to wait to see.''
   In a separate news conference, J. Nicholas Counter, president of
the alliance, said the Teamsters' demands were unreasonable in an
era of higher production costs.
   ``We've been very flexible in attempting to achieve our goals,''
Counter said. ``These issues are as important to us as the issues
in the writers' strike.''
   Counter said replacement drivers would have no problem filling
work requirements. ``We will continue to produce,'' Counter said.
``We will operate today. We will operate tomorrow.''
   Bush said the Teamsters had offered to extend the contract that
expired on July 31 for one year, but the producers refused. He
claimed the producers' bargaining position reflected an attempt to
``break the union.''
   Counter denied that producers were engaged in any union-busting
tactics. ``We will gain control of our costs,'' Counter said. ``And
that's not union-busting. We're trying to create more union jobs.''
   Bush said he did not know when talks would resume or how long
the strike might last. ``The next move is up to the federal
mediator.''

<HEAD>Fuel Economy Standard Set at 26.5 MPG for 1989 Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department on Monday set
fuel-economy standards for 1989 passenger cars at 26.5 miles per
gallon of gasoline, a level the nation's two largest automakers say
they could meet without layoffs and production cuts.
   The department's decision kept the fuel economy average required
for each auto manufacturer from increasing to the 27.5 mpg enacted
by Congress in 1975. Since 1986, the automakers have been required
to meet a 26 mpg standard.
   A higher requirement ``would have clearly put our domestic
full-line manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage compared to
some foreign manufacturers, especially the Asians, who have been
building only small cars and can easily meet the fuel-economy
requirements,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.
   The order issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, an agency within the Transportation Department,
said 26.5 mpg represented the level attainable by General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in their domestic fleets of passenger cars
without ``harmful production restrictions and without any
significant restrictions on consumer choice.''
   ``Thus, no job or sales losses should result from GM and Ford,
as well as the manufacturers of most foreign vehicles sold in this
country, meeting the standard; indeed, that standard should help
preserve the ability of the two domestic companies to recapture
sales and jobs from competitors,'' the NHTSA order said.
   GM and Ford, which had warned higher fuel-economy standards
would force cutbacks of big-car production and cost the industry
hundreds of thousands of jobs, were quick to praise the order.
Consumer groups were critical.
   GM said the decision ``was in the best interest of American
workers and consumer choice.'' The company said the 1975 law that
established the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards
was ``outdated.''
   Ford said the agency's decision ``recognizes that consumer
preferences resulting from low fuel prices have placed a
particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 27.5
mpg standard.''
   The nation's third-largest automaker, Chrysler Corp., whose car
line is concentrated in the smaller, more fuel-efficient models,
said only that it would exceed 27.5 mpg in 1989 and said ``a
meaningful gasoline tax would eliminate the need for a CAFE-like
regulatory system.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has argued that his company has
successfully met the fuel-economy level set by Congress and federal
regulators should not change the rules to help companies that have
been less successful in making fuel-efficient cars.
   The Center for Auto Safety, which favors stricter fuel-economy
standards, said through Director Clarence Ditlow that the
Transportation Department's decision was ``another cave-in by the
Reagan administration'' and vowed to go to court to try to force
the agency to let the standard increase to 27.5 mpg.
   Other critics, such as Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and the
Energy Conservation Coalition, called for higher standards to
reduce the release of gases into the atmosphere, arguing that
automotive emissions contribute to a long-term warming of the
Earth's atmosphere through the greenhouse effect.
   ``As the evidence mounts that the Earth is getting warmer and
may experience unprecedented temperature increases, the U.S. should
be improving automobile efficiency to reduce greenhouse
emissions,'' Wirth said.
   The Reagan administration, GM and Ford contend that the
fuel-economy standards, enacted to reduce petroleum imports, have
outlived their usefulness.
   With gasoline prices now running about $1 a gallon across the
nation, the need to conserve is less pressing than it was in the
mid-1970s and consumers want to buy larger cars, the administration
and the automakers say.
   NHTSA's decision coincided with release of a public opinion poll
concluding that 90 percent of Americans believe the government
should require the automakers to build more fuel-efficient cars.
   The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters Sept. 10-14 was
conducted for the Communications Consortium, a public relations
firm representing environmental groups. The margin of error was
about three percentage points.

<HEAD>Sudanese Prime Minister To Begin Peace Talks With Rebel Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi and rebel
leader John Garang will begin peace talks aimed at ending a
5-year-old civil war that has displaced thousands of people in
Sudan, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The English-language daily Sudan Times said the meeting probably
would be held late this month in Kampala, capital of neighboring
Uganda.
   El-Mahdi received a message last week from Garang expressing the
rebel leader's willingness to start negotiations, the newspaper
said. The message was delivered through Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, it said.
   If held, the meeting would be the second between el-Mahdi and
the former army officer who in 1983 launched a rebellion in
southern Sudan against the Moslem-dominated government. A June 1986
meeting in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, failed to end the
fighting.
   Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army claims control over most
of the southern countryside, while government forces dominate large
towns and cities.
   The rebels, mostly animists and Christians, demand the
government grant them more autonomy and initiate economic reforms.
   But some refugees have accused the guerrillas of taking their
crops and cattle and recruiting their young people.
   About 600 people fleeing the civil war in the countryside took
refuge in a town where thousands are fighting malnutrition and
diseases, the Sudan News Agency reported today. The new refugees
recently arrived in the town of el-Muglad, about 460 miles south of
Khartoum, which already is home to 5,000 people who escaped the
fierce battles between the rebels and government, the agency
reported. It did not give the exact date of the refugees' arrival.
   Half a dozen people were dying every day in el-Muglad from
spreading diseases caused by malnutrition, the agency said.
   Since 1983, about 820,000 people have left their homes in
southern Sudan as a result of the civil war. Some settled in
government-controlled towns and cities, while others wandered north
to Khartoum, and eastwards into Ethiopia. This summer, at least
8,000 people died of starvation while fleeing the war.
   El-Meiram, another town 500 miles south of Khartoum, houses
about 20,000 refugees under conditions of malnutrition and disease,
the agency said. About 2,550 people had died in el-Meiram between
June and August, the agency said.
   Tensions were mounting in the town because thousands of Arab
tribesmen and their cattle were expected to arrive there soon,
swelling the size of the town to about 70,000 people, the agency
said.
   The United States and other donor governments have recently
succeeded in moving large quantities of food and other supplies
into the Sudan, after months of difficulties that had frustrated
relief agencies, according to Jay F. Morris, deputy administrator
of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Arrangenments are
being made for the agency to provide $l.5 million to the Sudan
government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, according to
Deputy Spokesman Phyllis Oakley.
   Morris said that on Sept. 25 the guerrillas tried and failed to
shoot down a transport plane carrying U.S. supplies from Khartoum
to the city of Juba. He said the rebels also have threatened to
shoot down flights headed for Aweil, where 100 deaths a day from
starvation have been reported.
   ``We deplore these outrageous actions which target trucks and
planes that are undertaking humanitarian missions,'' Mrs. Oakley
said.
   Last month Mauris Lawya, the governor of Equatoria province,
said a convoy of 912 trucks bound for Juba under army escort had to
return to Yie because of rebel attacks. He added that in another
convoy only 96 out of 1,080 trucks were able to to reach Juba, 750
miles south of the capital.
   The rebels fear the government will use relief convoys to bring
reinforcements to areas the rebels control, which they claim
include 90 percent of the countryside in the south.

   The Rev. Louis J. Eisele, a Jesuit priest
and seismologist who was the first person to record an Alaskan
earthquake that killed 114 people in 1964, died Monday after a
brief illness. He was 76.
   Eisele, also a physicist, taught at the Roman Catholic Spring
Hill College in Mobile and operated its seismographic station for
more than 40 years.
   Eisele, nicknamed ``Father Earthquake,'' reported data on major
quakes to the National Earthquake Information Service and was the
first to record the March 2, 1964, quake. It registered 8.5 on the
Richter scale of ground motion.
   Eisele invented the Eisele AC Transducer pen and ink seismic
station. This year, he had installed a new seismographic electronic
recording unit at Spring Hill, the first such system in the country.
   Survivors include three sisters and a brother.
   His funeral will be Thursday at St. Joseph's Chapel on campus.

<TEXT>
   This financially strapped city is
keeping its promise to replace houses destroyed in July when a
790,000-gallon water tank collapsed and released a wall of water
downhill into a poor neighborhood.
   The July 22 flash flood killed three people, injured more than
20 and destroyed at least 13 adobe and wood homes. Cars, furniture
and parts of houses were washed to the bottom of the slope.
   The next day, Mayor Jaime Bermudez visited the neighborhood and
promised the city would provide medical care and replace everything
that could be replaced.
   Two months later, the city is erecting cinderblock replacement
houses.
   ``The flood forced the city to build me a new home, which is
better than what I had,'' Elida Molina said last week. ``Our new
home is going to have an indoor bathroom, a separate kitchen and a
bedroom. We had only one room before. Things are looking bright
now.''
   But her enthusiasm is tempered.
   ``Three boys that I knew were killed,'' she said. ``They can
never be replaced.''
   The water was released when a 75-foot-long wall of the concrete
water tank gave way. Officials believe heavy rain might have
weakened the tank's foundation.
   There was no immediate word Monday how much the disaster is
costing the city. City spokesman Mario Trejo was in a cabinet
meeting with the mayor in preparation for his state-of-the-city
speech. The money will come out of the public works and maintenance
department.
   Juarez, a city of 1.5 million people, has an operating budget of
less than $12 million and has been operating in the red since 1986,
so the rebuilding just adds to the deficit.
   In addition to the new houses, the city has provided a doctor
who set up a tent office in the neighborhood to provide free
medical attention and prescriptions.
   ``I'm going to be here for as long as people need medical
attention,'' said Dr. Leonardo Ruiz, who sees about 10 patients
daily. ``There aren't any more residents with serious injuries.
They have all gotten better.''
   ``We never expected this kind of help,'' said resident Maria
Santos Garcia. ``They tell us that in two weeks all the homes will
be rebuilt.''
   In the meantime, families are staying with relatives.
   What hasn't gotten better is some children's fear, Ms. Santos
said.
   ``When it starts raining, you see a lot of children crying and
running to their moms,'' she said. ``Some of the children are
afraid to go to sleep because they are afraid of waking up in
water.''
   The children get help from social workers who visit
periodically, she said.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Representation of Poor in Civil Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether federal courts have the authority to force lawyers to
represent in non-criminal cases people too poor to pay for legal
help.
   The justices said they will hear the appeal of John E. Mallard
of Fairfield, Iowa, who was ordered to represent prison inmates in
a suit charging prison officials with mistreatment and other
misconduct.
   Two current inmates and one former inmate at the Iowa state
penitentiary in Fort Madison said prison guards and officials filed
false disciplinary reports against them, physically mistreated them
and endangered their lives by revealing they were informants.
   A federal judge picked Mallard from a list of lawyers to
represent the three because they are too poor to hire attorneys.
   Mallard sought to be excused on grounds he lacked experience in
trial cases and that the federal courts lacked the power to require
an unwilling attorney to represent someone who requests a lawyer in
a civil case.
   Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid, at taxpayer expense,
generally a fraction of what they would receive normally.
   In civil rights cases like the one in the case acted on Monday,
lawyers are paid expenses and may be paid a part of any damages won
by their clients.
   U.S. District Judge Harold D. Vietor denied Mallard's motion to
be excused from the inmates' suit.
   ``Mallard can hardly claim incompetence when he has filed an
18-page brief in support of this motion that demonstrates thorough
research, careful reasoning and effective writing,'' Vietor said.
``Despite his renunciation of any claim to being a litigator,
Mallard does have litigation experience. Mallard is not
incompetent.''
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Vietor's decision
last December.
   The Iowa attorney general's office urged the Supreme Court to
reject Mallard's appeal. The office acknowledged that it is a
hardship for lawyers to be forced to take cases without being paid
a fee.
   But, the attorney general's office said, ``The attorney
appointment process ... spreads the risk of that hardship, makes
more efficient and effective the utilization of practicing
attorneys and is soundly rooted in the ethical obligation of each.''
   The case is Mallard vs. U.S. District Court, 87-1490.

<HEAD>Farmers Begin Signing Up for Federal Drought Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers began signing up for payments Monday
under a $3.9 billion benefits package to aid victims of the drought
that hammered the nation's croplands over the summer.
   ``The telephones have been real busy all morning with calls from
people asking for appointments,'' said James Anderson, director of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS)
office in Brown County, S.D.
   The Agriculture Department agency is in charge of parceling out
aid under the program President Reagan signed into law on Aug. 11
to offset losses among farmers from a drought that reduced the U.S.
harvest an estimated 31 percent.
   Brisk business was reported at ASCS offices in the nothern Grain
Belt, where blistering sun and scarce rainfall wrecked the spring
wheat crop. In most places, though, there was no stampede on the
first day of a lengthy sign-up period that ends in March.
   Across the midcontinent, many farmers were still in their fields
harvesting what was left of their crops after the drought. Only
after they are finished will they know the full extent of their
losses _ prerequisite for receiving benefits under the program.
   ``It's a production-loss program,'' said Dale Hertlein,
executive director of the Fayette County, Ohio, ASCS office. ``So
to know exactly what the guy has lost, he will have to finish
harvesting first.''
   In Texas, ASCS state executive director Terence G. Harman said
quiet prevailed at most of the agency's 239 county offices.
   ``We're in harvest in a lot of the crops down here ... and so
we're involved in a lot of other things rather than standing in
line,'' he said. ``I think there will be a gradual trickle'' of
farmers coming in to apply for the benefits in the months ahead.
   ``I'm sure there must be somebody in the state of Iowa who is
done with the harvest,'' said Bob Furleigh, state ASCS director.
But he said there was no flood of farmers at the agency's offices.
   ASCS has county offices nationwide and in some cases farmers who
have wrapped up the harvest can do much of the ``paperwork'' of
applying for benefits on computer terminals in those offices.
   Sometimes, farmers can obtain a check on the day that they apply
for the aid. In other cases, the length of the wait varies.
   The cost of the assistance remains uncertain, although officials
say it could exceed the $3.9 billion price tag estimated when the
measure won congressional approval.
   Among highlights for eligible producers:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>LIVESTOCK AID</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock producers with annual gross revenues of less than $2.5
million can get either half of their feed costs from the government
or surplus grain owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
at discounted prices.
   Those eligible are producers of cattle, sheep, goats, swine,
poultry, horses, mules and donkeys used for food or in the
production of food, and fish used for commercial food production.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CROP AID</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop producers with gross annual revenues of less than $2
million can receive payments for losses greater than 35 percent of
normal production.
   They are eligible for aid equal to 90 percent of losses in
excess of 75 percent of normal production.
   Producers also are eligible for assistance equal to 65 percent
of losses between 35 percent of normal production and 75 percent.
   These losses are calculated on the basis of ``payment rates''
set by the Agriculture Department and which vary from one crop to
another.
   On that basis, some of the payment rates will involve:
   _For crops participating in farm programs, such as wheat, feed
grains, cotton and rice, the payment rate will be the target price,
a figure set by Congress, adjusted by the secretary of agriculture
and normally used to calculated ``deficiency,'' or income support,
payments for farmers.
   _For non-participating program crops, the payment rate will be
the county rate for price-support loans.
   _For tobacco, the payment rate will be the national average
price-support loan rate for the type of tobacco involved.
   _For sugar beets and sugar cane, the payment rate will be ``a
level determined by the secretary to be fair and reasonable'' in
relation to 1988-crop price supports for beets and cane.
   _For soybeans and non-program crops, the payment rate will be
the average commodity price received in the state for the previous
five years, not counting the high and low years.
   Among other provisions, farmers who received advance deficiency,
or income-support, payments ``may not have to refund (those)
otherwise unearned payments on crop losses up to 35 percent of
normal production.''
   An owner of 1,000 or fewer acres of trees planted for commercial
purposes will be eligible for 65 percent federal assistance if
losses of the 1987 or 1988 tree seedlings is greater than 35
percent, adjusted for normal mortality.

   The Supreme Court, studying whether states may
use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult bookstores, was told
Monday by an Indiana prosecutor that a key part of that state's law
may be invalid.
   Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, prosecuting attorney for
Marion County, conceded under questioning from the justices during
the opening day of the new court term that some pre-trial seizures
of material may be unconstitutional.
   But Goldsmith said the questionable nature of pre-trial seizures
should not be a basis to throw out racketeering laws that are
providing a growing number of states with a powerful new weapon to
fight obscenity and organized crime.
   Invalidating such laws ``would provide a safe haven for
organized crime,'' Goldsmith said.
   John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer representing
Indiana bookstore owners, said the racketeering laws pose a major
threat to free speech.
   ``A basic governing concept that has ennobled the country's
history is that anyone may not lose the right of speaking by
speaking,'' he said.
   Weston said laws like the one in Indiana not only threaten book
sellers but also abridge ``the American public's right to receive
vast quantities of material.''
   Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law,
patterned after the much-used federal RICO act, authorizes law
enforcement officials to seize property used in a racketeering
enterprise.
   The law was used in March 1984 against three Fort Wayne
bookstores selling sexually explicit materials. Each was accused of
at two least violations of the state's obscenity laws.
   Authorities padlocked the stores and seized all inventory.
Similar legal action was taken against three stores in Indianapolis
_ although those store owners did not appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The three Fort Wayne bookstores were allowed to reopen in April
1985, but only one, Fort Wayne Books, remains in business. It filed
one of the appeals that the Supreme Court agreed to study and
decide by July.
   The justices also are reviewing a companion case in which the
Howard County, Ind., sheriff's office charged Ronald Sappenfield
with distributing obscene material and violating the state RICO
law. The case has not yet gone to trial.
   An Indiana appeals court ruled in June 1985 that applying the
state RICO law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenity
violates free speech rights.
   Padlocking bookstores accused but not convicted of selling
obscene material is impermissible ``prior restraint'' on free
expression, the appeals court said.
   But the Indiana Supreme Court in March 1987 reinstated the law.
   During an hour's arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on
Monday, Goldsmith was pressed to explain why law enforcement
officials could seize a store's entire inventory of books based on
as little as two sales of an osbcene book.
   Justice John Paul Stevens said the law seems to brand the
bookstore as a criminal enterprise that authorizes an
inventory-wide seizure ``even if the rest of the store is filled
with nothing but Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare.''
   Goldsmith said the law is designed to apply with equal force to,
for example, drug dealers and smut peddlers. It would be ``no
different than if cocaine were sold twice,'' he said. The purpose
is to prevent organized crime from shielding the proceeds of
illegal activities, he said.
   While Goldsmith conceded that pre-trial seizures of bookstore
inventory may be unconstitutional, he argued that in the case of
Fort Wayne Books the law enforcement activities were permissible.
   He said the store was convicted 39 times previously of obscenity
violations.
   Goldsmith also said that post-conviction seizures of bookstores
should be permitted even if the high court invalidates pre-trial
seizures.
   The justices also quizzed Weston vigorously.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist questioned why someone
convicted of obscenity violations should be protected from having
property seized any more than a drug dealer should enjoy that
safeguard.
   ``Peddling obscenity is not presumptively protected by the First
Amendment,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Trio Says Untested Part Used On Navy Helicopters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Navy airman and a former civilian co-worker
allege that untested parts from a wrecked Huey helicopter are being
used to keep a pair of rescue helicopters in operation at the
Navy's Corpus Christi base.
   Petty Officer Bryan Sims of Houston, and a former petty officer
who did not want to be identified, told the Houston Chronicle they
have been punished for objecting to the practice of installing
unproven parts from a Huey that crashed in 1985, killing three
crewmen.
   Their former co-worker, a mechanic, also asked not to be
identified, the Chronicle said.
   The former petty officer received an honorable discharge this
year. Sims, 27, faces a court-martial. Both maintain that
accusations against them, ranging from alcohol abuse to losing
gear, are false.
   Sims, a helicopter mechanic still assigned to the Corpus Christi
Naval Air Station, says gauges, hydraulic equipment and flight
control rods were switched from the wrecked helicopter to the pair
still in service.
   A base spokesman said the Hueys have been tested and are safe,
but he would not immediately discuss how spare parts are obtained.
   Lt. Barbara Kent, a spokeswoman at Navy headquarters in
Washington, said the Navy does not routinely use parts from wrecked
equipment.
   She said any part that is recovered from a damaged aircraft
``must be properly tested and certified ready for issue.''
   ``Any naval aircraft which has had maintenance performed on a
part of the flight control system, engine or any other
safety-of-flight related component or system, is flight tested
before final clearance for normal operations,'' Kent added.
   The three who talked to the Chronicle said orders to transfer
the parts were issued by chief petty officers, and the parts were
not examined or tested before being installed.
   The mechanic told the newspaper that the helicopters could crash
if the control rods malfunction.
   Sims and the other men acknowledged they have no proof that the
recycled parts have malfunctioned during flight.
   The Hueys are used primarily to rescue airmen from trouble
during training flights from bases in Corpus Christi, Beeville and
Kingsville. They also back up the Coast Guard during any rescues of
civilians in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Base spokesman Lt. Robert Stevens said the Hueys are being
inspected by an Army maintenance team and are safe. The
inspections, he said, are not in response to objections from any
airmen.
   Base commander Capt. C.L. Reynolds said the Navy ``is not
attempting to harass or discriminate against'' Sims.
   Personnel records supplied by Sims contain several positive
assessments. But, Sims said, he started receiving negative ratings
in 1986 after he refused an order to transfer a control arm from
the wrecked helicopter, which was stored outdoors, to a working one.
   One 1988 evaluation says Sims should not remain in the service
because he is ``self-serving and self-seeking'' and has ``a sullen,
arrogant and condescending attitude.''
   None of the criticisms mentions any refusal by Sims to transfer
the helicopter parts.

   The United States will provide $125 million in
long-term aid to help Jamaica cope with the aftermath of Hurricane
Gilbert, President Reagan told Jamaican President Edward Seaga on
Monday.
   The hurricane took more than 25 lives and caused millions of
dollars in property damage in the island nation Sept. 12-14.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in a statement on
Reagan's meeting with Seaga, said the president also thanked the
Jamaican leader for his government's drug eradication efforts.
   He said Seaga outlined Jamaica's program of reconstruction in
the wake of the hurricane and showed the president pictures of the
destruction on the island.
   One picture showed an entire housing complex with no roofs, the
spokesman said. Another showed a banana and poultry farm that had
been wiped out.

<HEAD>Wife of Misidentified Airman Says it was Like Death Sentence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of an Air Force officer whose
plane crashed during the Vietnam War testified Monday that the
misidentification of some bone fragments as his was like giving him
a death sentence should he still be alive in Southeast Asia.
   ``The message went out to those countries: `Don't you ever
return that guy because this would be a real humiliation''' to the
U.S. government, Anne Hart told a federal judge hearing a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit brought by Mrs. Hart, her daugher
Gillian and her mother-in-law Vera Hart.
   The 45-year-old Pensacola woman was was the first witness in the
non-jury, civil trial over the military's misidentification of
seven bone fragments found at a plane crash site in Laos as being
the remains of Lt. Col. Thomas Hart III.
   The military withdrew the identification after an outside expert
hired by Mrs. Hart said it was impossible to tell if the fragments
belonged to her husband or anyone else.
   The lawsuit claims the three suffered emotional distress as a
result of the misidentification, which they contend was
intentional, and they are seeking an unspecified amount put only in
the multimillion-dollar range. Five other children originally
listed as plaintiffs have been dropped from the suit.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Winston Arnow ruled Jan. 12 that Mrs.
Hart suffered from severe emotional distress, leaving only the
matter of damages to be decided in her portion of the case.
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs will try to show Hart's mother also
was emotionally distressed and that his daughter suffered from
bulemia, an eating disorder that caused her to lose 30 pounds.
   ``It's very similar to living without any skin,'' Anne Hart said
of her life since the dispute over the bones' identification began
in 1985.
   She described the initial news of her husband's plane crash Dec.
21, 1972, and then the identification of the remains more than 13
years later as like being ``hit with a two-by-four.''
   She said she recovered enough to lead a relatively normal life
after the crash, but she has been unable to do so following the
misidentification of the remains and the military's insistance on
burying them as her husband.
   A self-proclaimed ``Army brat'' whose father was a military
physician, she accused Army and Air Force officials of lying to her
and causing her to become so disillusioned with the government she
once revered that she had to seek professional counseling for
emotional distress.
   She said she has has trouble sleeping and gave up activities
with the National League of Families, a support group for families
of servicemen who are missing in action or had been prisoners. She
testified she spends most of her waking hours as a volunteer worker
at the Pensacola Veterans' Center, where she can be with people who
feel the same way.
   She also testified she has left her children to fend for
themselves, failed to pay bills although she had the money to do so
and can see no reason for living, although she lacks the courage to
commit suicide.
   Hart was one of 16 crew members aboard the AC-130 Spectre
gunship when it was shot down near Pakse, Laos.
   Two crewmen were rescued and one was immediately identified as
killed, but the other 13 has been listed as missing until the crash
site was excavated by U.S. Army and Laotian authorities in 1985.

   Moslem kidnappers on Monday released
Indian hostage Mithileshwar Singh after more than 20 months in
captivity, police said. Syrian authorities who received him refused
to confirm his identity immediately.
   Singh, a resident alien of the United States, was set free at
10:05 p.m. (3:05 p.m. EDT) near the headquarters of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Beirut, said a police
spokesman who demanded anonymity.
   The reported release followed press reports that American
hostage Alann Steen was about to be released.
   Singh, 60, a finance professor, Steen and two other American
teachers were kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987 by gunmen posing as riot
police at the campus of Beirut University College, where they
taught.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine claimed
responsibility for the kidnappings. Singh's reported release came
five minutes after a deadline set by the group in a 36-word
handwritten statement released earlier Monday to a Western news
agency in Beirut.
   In Damascus, the minister of state for foreign affairs, Nasser
Qaddor, said that an American hostage had been released and was in
Syrian hands. Qaddor would not reveal his identity, telling
journalists to return to the foreign ministry at 9 a.m. Tuesday, (2
a.m. EDT) when the hostage would be handed over to the American
ambassador.
   Singh holds an Indian passport but also has an American green
card, making him a legal resident alien in the United States.
   In another statement released Saturday, the kidnappers said they
would free one of the hostages as a goodwill gesture to the United
States.
   The group said the release was designed to stimulate U.S.
support for the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's
military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
   Steen, 49, a native of Boston, was professor of journalism at
Beirut University College. His wife, 31, of Jackson, Mich., is a
fine arts professor at the school.
   The other hostages the group claims to hold are: Jesse Turner,
41, a native of Boise, Idaho, and a professor of mathematics and
computer science; and Robert Polhill, 54, of New York City,
professor of business and lecturer in accounting.
   Nine Americans are missing in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Some residents whose homes were rattled by
sonic booms from Discovery on Monday said they were delighted by
the thundering reminders that America is back in space.
   ``They don't bother me one bit,'' said Wayne Roper of Ojai, a
resort community 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. ``It's just
good to have them back. I love the space shuttle.''
   Ojai residents have long lived under the flight path of space
shuttles and are used to the sonic booms that in the past have
broken windows and knocked glassware off shelves in the largely
rural, mountainous area.
   But no problems were reported with the Discovery's booms, which
most treated like the return of an old friend after the skies went
silent following the Challenger tragedy 32 months ago.
   ``It startled for me for a second. And then I said to myself,
`There's the Discovery,''' said John Christianson. ``Then I didn't
have to wonder anymore whether everything would be all right. I
knew the shuttle was here.''
   The Discovery glided at supersonic speeds over Ojai at about
9:30 a.m. PDT before safely landing seven minutes later on a dry
lake bed in the Mojave Desert to the cheers of more than 400,000
spectators.
   The sonic booms, caused by shock waves produced by Discovery as
it traveled faster than the speed of sound, were heard from as far
north as Santa Barbara and south to suburban Valencia, about 35
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   Police dispatchers in Santa Barbara and Ojai said they got one
call each from people asking about the noise, but no damage was
reported.
   Valencia resident Linda Ruhland described the sound as a
``ba-boom.''
   ``I thought it was sort of sexy,'' she said.

<HEAD>State Department Says Sudanese Rebels Attack Aid Convoys</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels have attacked aid shipments,
reversing their previous practice of letting them proceed safely,
the State Department said Monday.
   Jay F. Morris, deputy administrator of the United States' Agency
for International Development, said that nine drivers and
assistants from Kenya are dead or missing and an unknown number of
relief trucks were abandoned Sept. 8, when forces of the Sudanese
Peoples Liberation Army attacked a convoy driving from Yei to Juba.
   Morris said that on Sept. 25 the rebels tried unsuccessfully to
shoot down a transport plane carrying U.S. supplies from Khartoum
to Juba. He said the rebels have threatened any flights heading for
Aweil, where 100 deaths a day from starvation have been reported.
   ``We deplore these outrageous actions which target trucks and
planes that are undertaking humanitarian missions,'' said
department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   She said arrangements are being made for AID to provide $1.5
million to the Sudanese government. A U.S. team has been sent to
help the Khartoum government and other donors to work out a plan to
meet the area's needs.
   Christian and other guerrillas in The Sudan, which is directly
south of Egypt, have been fighting since 1983 against the country's
Moslem-led government.
   According to Morris, thousands of refugees have been driven from
the countryside into towns, especially in the southern part of
Kordofan province, which is near the area that has seen the most
fighting. The United States and other governments have recently
moved large amounts of food and other supplies into the area, after
months of difficulties.
   The rebels fear the government will use relief convoys to bring
reinforcements to areas the rebels control, which they claim
include 90 percent of the countryside in the south.

   A Pittsburgh couple fell in love then fell
into marriage, plunging 3,000 feet by parachute to their wedding
site.
   ``Is this what I envisioned? No. I envisioned St. Mary's Church
in Warren, Ohio,'' said JoAnn Nardo, mother of the bride.
   Sabrina Nardo, 31, of Pittsburgh, a graphic artist, and Edwin
``Ebby'' Boehm Jr., 33, chef and manager of a Pittsburgh
restaurant, met while skydiving four years ago. They jumped from an
airplane Sunday and landed in the park in downtown Pittsburgh,
where they exchanged vows in an outdoor ceremony.
   The bride wore a satin jumpsuit, which, with the crackle of
Velcro retainers, converted into a gown. She replaced her beaded
jump cap with a veil and put on makeup after landing.
   ``I was terrified there for a few seconds,'' Miss Nardo said
after wind deflected her landing from the park lawn to a paved
walkway on the edge of the Monongahela River.
   ``It all worked out. Besides, I didn't want to get grass stains
on my clothes,'' she said.
   ``The jump was terrific,'' said Boehm. ``This marriage, it's
only going to keep on getting better.''

<HEAD>Indian Professor Thought He Was Safe in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends say Mithileshwar Singh, the Indian professor taken
hostage in Lebanon with three Americans last January, thought he
was safe in that strife-torn land.
   J.B. Curtis, president of now-defunct Western Colorado
University, where the 60-year-old Singh taught, called him a
``dedicated educator.''
   ``He had a contract and would honor his agreement. He enjoyed
his students and believed he was safe,'' Curtis said of Singh, who
is a resident alien of the United States.
   A family friend, Mary Pillais, said Singh told her during a
visit in September 1986 ``there was nothing to be afraid of. He
said there were guards at the university to protect them.''
   Another friend, Ruth Dale, said Singh's wife Lalmoney did not
want to return to his post at Beirut University College ``because
of all the bombing and fighting. But Mr. Singh said there was
nothing to worry about. The fighting was miles away.''
   Singh was born in Varanasi, India, Dec. 13, 1927. He taught
eight years at the University of Agra and eight years as an
assistant professor at the University of Gorakhpur before coming to
the United States in 1965 to do graduate work at the University of
Oregon in Eugene.
   He graduated from the University of Oregon in 1968 with a
master's degree in business administration, and received his
doctorate from Western Colorado, an independent-study institution
that operated in 1970-83, according to Beirut University College.
   Singh taught at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville in
1970-72 as an assistant professor of business management. He also
taught business at Milton College, Wis., before moving to Grand
Junction, Colo., in 1976.
   In Grand Junction, he taught at Western Colorado University and
the Western Colorado School of Business, which later merged with
Technical Trades Institute, a vocational and business school still
in operation.
   Singh was offered a one-year visiting professorship in Beirut in
the fall of 1983. He ``liked the students and the school and when
they asked him to stay on, he did,'' said Curtis.
   Curtis said Singh later was named chairman of the business
department on the Beirut campus.
   He was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 and his abduction was claimed by
the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   The Singhs have no children, Curtis said.

   Fifteen people were treated at hospitals and released for
complaints associated with the chemicals.
   The vandals broke a bottle containing a mixture of several
chemicals, including the pesticide malathion, sending noxious fumes
through cooling ducts in the three-story, windowless Hialeah-Miami

   A python was among the animals released. The intruders also
emptied refrigerators and scattered papers.
   The cars were not found and no arrests had been made.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analyses used by federal agencies to check on
pesticides in the nation's food supply can't detect about half the
pesticides permitted to be used, a research arm of Congress
reported Monday.
   Food is checked by the Food Safety Inspection Service of the
Agriculture Department, which analyzes meat and poultry; the
department's Agricultural Marketing Service, which analyzes eggs;
and the Food and Drug Administration, part of the Health and Human
Services Department, which analyzes all other foods.
   As a routine matter, the agencies can use only ``multi-residue''
analyses _ methods that reveal the concentration of a number of
compounds. Except in special cases, methods useful for detecting
only one compound are too expensive to use, the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment reported.
   There are 316 pesticide active ingredients for which the
Environmental Protection Agency has established maximum permissible
concentration of residues in food, or tolerances.
   The OTA report said the five multi-residue methods used by the
Food and Drug Administration can detect only 163 compounds.
   Similarly, these methods can detect only 10 of 74 compounds with
pending or temporary tolerances, 25 of 56 with no established
tolerance and 92 of 297 breakdown products, impurities or other
``pesticide-associated chemicals.''
   The report presented less detail on the Food Safety Inspection
Service, but did say the four methods used there can detect about
40 chemicals.
   ``FSIS has identified 10 highly ranked pesticides it would like
to monitor routinely but cannot using its multiresidue methods,''
the report said.
   FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said the agency had not had a chance
to study the report and therefore could not comment. A chemist to
whom he referred detailed questions did not answer.
   USDA spokeswoman Karen Stuck said she was seeking comment from
agency officials.
   Diane Baxter, staff scientist for the National Coalition Against
the Misuse of Pesticides, said the lack of coverage in routine
monitoring ``worries us very much.''
   She said fungicides of a class called ``EBDC'' whose breakdown
products cause cancer and the herbicide glyphosate are chemicals
that need routine monitoring.
   Results from what analyses could be performed showed a low
failure rate. The report said 2.5 percent of about 12,700 samples
last year showed excessive residues, but the sampling was not
random.
   Samples contained a higher percentage of fruits and vegetables
than the general food supply, and were biased toward food-pesticide
combinations known to yield residue problems.

<HEAD>Deaver Files Appeal of Conviction for Lying to Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver
filed a formal appeal Monday of his conviction that he lied under
oath when questioned by a grand jury and a House subcommittee about
his lobbying activities.
   The former deputy White House chief of staff was given a
suspended three-year sentence and a $100,000 fine last month by
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   The judge also ordered Deaver to perform 1,500 hours of
community service and barred him from lobbying the federal
government for pay during a three-year period the former White
House aide was placed on probation.
   A longtime friend of President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
Deaver became a Washington lobbyist after resigning from his White
House job in May 1985.
   He was convicted last year of lying in 1986 to a grand jury and
the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee that
investigated whether his lobbying of former Reagan administration
colleagues violated conflict-of-interest laws.
   The formal notice of appeal, signed by Deaver and his lawyer,
Herbert J. Miller Jr., was filed in U.S. District Court.

<HEAD>Court to Rule in Pension Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court announced Monday it will
settle a dispute over pension benefits in which billions of dollars
could be at stake.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the Mead Corp. of
Dayton, Ohio, which was ordered to pay additional pension benefits
to six workers at a Virginia company formerly owned by Mead.
   Mead acquired Lynchburg Foundry Co. in Virginia in 1968 and set
up a pension plan that provided early-retirement benefits to
workers at age 62 and had 30 years of service.
   Mead sold Lynchburg Foundry to a new owner in 1983 and
terminated the pension plan.
   It refused to pay the early retirement benefits to the six
workers. Five of them had worked more than 30 years apiece although
none had reached 62. The sixth had worked 28 years and was 61.
   The six were given lump-sum benefits by Mead that were based on
a retirement age of 65 _ a total of about $56,500 less for all six
than they would have received under the early-retirement plan.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in April 1987 that
Mead must pay additional benefits to the former employees from a
$10 million surplus in the company's pension fund.
   The appeals court said five of the six workers must receive
benefits based on what they would be entitled to if they retired at
62 and the benefits for the sixth should be calculated on a
retirement age of 63 that he would reach with 30 years service.
   The appeals court based its ruling on the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, a federal law designed to protect
workers' pensions.
   Mead said billions of dollars could be at stake in the case for
pension plans nationwide.
   More than 49 million workers are covered by 849,000 retirement
plans that control almost $2 trillion in assets, the company said,
and the issues involved in the case acted on Monday affect more
than a quarter of those plans.
   The case is Mead Corp. vs. Tilley, 87-1868.

<HEAD>Soviets Propose World's Armies Set Aside Units For U.N.
Peacekeeping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union says it is ready to set
aside troops for a reserve of U.N. peacekeepers to be sent to
global flashpoints, if other nations do the same.
   It also suggests posting U.N. peacekeepers in ``explosive areas
of the world.''
   Carolyn Dulin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission, said of
Moscow's latest proposals, ``These are interesting ideas; I would
not say they are good or bad.''
   She said, however, that the suggestions are the latest in an
overall Soviet package of proposals for international security
which Washington opposes on the grounds it would replace the
existing U.N. charter.
   Last Thursday, the U.N. peacekeeping operations were awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize for 1988.
   The latest Soviet proposal, first introduced as a document to
the General Assembly on Sept. 22 and now bound for assembly
consideration, calls for ``the establishment of a reserve of
military observers and armed forces of the United Nations.''
   ``The U.S.S.R. is prepared to participate in the formation on a
mutual basis with other countries of a system of personnel training
for service in the United Nations troops,'' it added.
   The Soviets said they would be willing to provide their own
military units in appropriate peacekeeping situations.
   The five permanent members of the Security Council _ the United
States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union _ usually do
not send troops to join peacekeeping units to avoid accusations
that the superpowers or former colonial powers are trying to
involve their armed forces in local conflicts.
   There have been exceptions, such as the British peacekeepers in
Cyprus and Americans in Lebanon, when the countries requesting
peacekeepers do not object.
   The Soviet proposal also suggested an expanded use of U.N.
peacekeepers ``in situations where accusations are made of outside
interference for the purpose of destabilizing governments,'' and
putting U.N. observers along the borders of a nation fearing
foreign interference ``at the request of that country alone.''
   Last week, the Soviets assailed the U.N. peacekeepers in
Pakistan and Afghanistan for allegedly not investigating Soviet and
Afghan claims that Pakistan was repeatedly violating the April 14
Geneva accord on Afghanistan. The Soviets and Afghans accused
Pakistan of trying to undermine Afghanistan.
   The accord calls for Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and for
non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said
last week the fate of future peacekeeping forces is in question
because of this issue.
   The Soviets could use their seat on the Security Council to
block establishment of peacekeeping units.
   The newest Soviet U.N. peacekeeping proposals are part of the
``Comprehensive System of International Peace and Security'' that
Moscow has introduced for three General Assembly sessions, so far
without success.
   ``It's no secret that we're against the `comprehensive
system,''' said U.S. spokeswoman Dulin on Monday. ``We feel that's
sort of a reforming of the U.N. Charter, which we feel is not
necessary.''
   Other Western U.N. ambassadors on the Security Council have said
they think some Soviet proposals have merit; their objection is
only to the overall package, which they say would replace the
Charter.

<HEAD>Iran Says Mild U.N. Action on Chemical Weapons Encouraged Iraqi
Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said Monday the Security Council's
meek criticism of the Iraqis' use of poison gas encouraged Iraq
``to continue ... its horrifying use of chemical weapons'' against
the Kurdish minority.
   The allegation was made by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velyati in his address to the 43rd session of the General Assembly.
   Iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons against Iran in the
8-year-old war between the Persian Gulf nations, but has denied
using such weapons against its own Kurdish rebels battling for
autonomy in northwestern Iraq.
   Iraq also has accused Iran of using chemical weapons in the war
_ a charge Iran has denied.
   The U.S. State Department has said it has evidence Iraq used
poison gas against the Kuridsh insurgents.
   Velyati told the General Assembly, ``While the Security Council
dealt in two different resolutions, 612 and 620, with the Iraqi use
of chemical weapons, the mild nature of the resolutions in fact
encouraged Iraq to continue on a massive scale its horrifying use
of chemical weapons.''
   Resolution 612 condemned the use of chemical weapons and 620
criticized the use of such weapons ``against Iranians'' without
mentioning Iraq.
   Western diplomats have said the Security Council did not
specifically denounce Iraq because it hoped to avoid complicating
the Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   Velayati said that after the Security Council resolutions Iraq
``used on a large scale chemical weapons against its own Kurds in
the northern part of the country.''
   The foreign minister again blamed Iraq for starting the war and
claimed the Iraqis had seized more than 700 prisoners of war since
a U.N.-mediated cease-fire began Aug. 20.
   Velyati gave no indication of any change in Iran's positon on
the disputed Shatt-al-Arab estuary, which is the southern boundary
between the two nations and is Iraq's only waterway outlet to the
Persian Gulf.
   A boundary treaty was established in 1975, but Iraq has
repudiated it and claims Iran abrogated the accord in 1979. Iraq
wants control over both banks of the Shatt-al-Arab to ensure a
secure passage to the gulf.
   That is a main issue stalling peace negotiations that remained
deadlocked after a session at the United Nations on Saturday. It
was the first meeting between Iran and Iraq since talks in Geneva
on Sept. 13.
   Velayati, without naming Israel, also said the conflicts in the
Middle East cannot be resolved until ``this racist regime is
eradicated and the rights of Palestinians to self-determination and
the establishment of an independent government within their own
territory are restored.

<HEAD>OTC Dealers Accept Market-Wide Trading Halts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers
announced Monday that despite its opposition in principle to
market-wide trading halts, it would go along with one at the
request of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Although the NASD, which governs the over-the-counter stock
market, repeated its objections in detail, the new position by its
board of governors is seen as removing an obstacle to SEC approval
of a proposed one-year experiment with a trading halt rule.
   In July, the New York Stock Exchange, the nation's largest stock
market, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest market for
stock index futures, submitted a so-called ``circuit breaker'' plan
that would halt trading across markets for one hour if the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 250 points or more or if the futures
market dropped by a parallel amount. The plan calls for a two-hour
halt if the Dow fell an additional 150 points.
   If the NASD had refused to budge, it would have made
implementation of the pilot program difficult because the SEC does
not have authority to impose an across-the-board market halt
without a presidential order.
   Ever since the stock market crash last Oct. 19, when the Dow
fell 508 points, securities industry and government officials have
been trying to agree on measures to calm volatility and restore
investor confidence.
   One of the few concrete proposals to emerge has been the circuit
breaker concept first advanced by the White House task force headed
by investment banker and now Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
An administration working group that included the heads of the
regulatory agencies affected, including the SEC, later endorsed it.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue said of the NASD position, ``We
believe it's a constructive action and it's generally consistent
with the recommendations of the working group.''
   She said the agency has not yet acted on the submission from the
NYSE and Merc, but said action on such proposals is generally taken
within 90 days.
   Those who favor circuit breakers say the stock and futures
markets in effect behave as one market because high-speed computer
linkages. Proponents argue that it is better to artificially stop
trading at a predetermined point before one market breaks down,
sending sell orders cascading into markets that remain open.
   However, NASD Joseph R. Hardiman said in a statement that
circuit breakers ``are likely to increase market volatility rather
than curb it.''
   ``The closer a market gets to a circuit breaker level, the more
likely it is of reaching as sellers rush to execute orders under
the wire. Academic studies also indicate that markets are the most
volatile at the opening or reopening of a security following a
trading halt,'' he said.
   But the NASD statement said its board ``acknowledged that there
may be unacceptable risks imposed on any market which remains open
when all its counterparts have closed.''
   ``We're recognizing we're living in the real world here and if
all other markets close, we can't just stand here and be the market
of last liquidity,'' said NASD spokesman Bob Ferri.
   The new NASD stance is effective through the end of 1989.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Praise Shuttle Crew; Second Debate Up In The Air</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: TOP 11 grafs new with debate developments and new Dukakis
ads, picking up 8th pvs, Bush and...clear winner.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis hailed
the success of the Discovery space shuttle mission on Monday, while
their top campaign aides found a new sponsor for the second debate
after the League of Women Voters abruptly withdrew.
   ``A great day for our country,'' proclaimed the Republican vice
president, who was on hand at Edwards Air Force Base, California,
to witness the landing of the shuttle. Bush was driven to within a
few feet of the spacecraft and shook the hands of the five-member
crew as they emerged.
   ``America is back in space,'' Democrat Dukakis told a rally in
Hartford, Conn. ``We are proud and we are thrilled at its
achievements and the courage of that crew.''
   Meanwhile, both campaigns quickly found a sponsor to replace the
league.
   Dukakis campaign Chairman Paul Brountas said he talked with Bush
Chairman James A. Baker III by telephone and that they agreed to
ask the bipartisan commission that had sponsored the first debate
to sponsor the second as well. The commission agreed and all well
go ahead on schedule, Brountas said.
   Bush campain spokesman Mark Goodin said as well that both sides
have agreed to a commission-sponsored debate no later than Oct. 14.
He said the commission will have to decide on the location although
it will try to hold the debate in Los Angeles, where it was
originally scheduled to be held Oct. 13 or Oct. 14.
   The forum was scheduled to be held Oct. 13 or 14.
   Janet Brown, executive director of the bipartisan commission
that sponsored the first debate, said earlier Monday the panel had
received ``very positive messages'' from both campaigns that it
would be asked to take over sponsorship of the second forum.
   The Dukakis campaign also disclosed it is running two more
television ads, part of series called, ``The Packaging of George
Bush.''
   The new ads show men sitting around a table and discussing how
to portray Bush as an environmentalist and how to deal with
allegations of administration ties to Panamanian military leader
Manuel Noriega.
   Both ads end with a voice saying: ``They'd like to sell you a
package. Wouldn't you rather choose a president?''
   Bush and Dukakis debated Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem, N.C., a
confrontation after which both sides said they were pleased with
the outcome and neutral observers found no clear winner.
   The vice presidential candidates _ Republican Dan Quayle and
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen _ were off the campaign trail, preparing for
their debate Wednesday night in Omaha, Neb.
   Bentsen was doing his preparation in an Austin, Texas, hotel and
during a brief break he told reporters: ``I think we're relaxed for
it; I think we're ready for it. ... I'm not nervous.''
   The first presidential debate was sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a body co-chaired by Paul G. Kirk Jr. and
Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican
parties, respectively.
   The League, which was to sponsor the second presidential debate,
abruptly withdrew from that role and president Nancy Neuman told a
Washington news conference that ``we have no intention of becoming
an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American people.''
   Ms. Neuman said League officials objected to an agreement
reached between the two campaigns which covered all details of the
debate.
   ``The issue is who's in control of the debate,'' said Ms. Neuman.
   The agreement between the two campaigns covered such details as
the makeup of the panel of questioners, the time the candidates
would have for responses, as well as where people would sit in the
hall and whether the debaters would sit or stand.
   The campaigns worked out similar details between themselves for
the first debate and proclaimed all parties pleased with the
arrangement.
   Brountas said he thought the debate commission was ``very
pleased'' with the way the first debate went.
   Tate said she thought most Americans would agree with the
campaigns on the issue of control over such details.
   Campaigning in Connecticut, Dukakis said, ``Mr. Bush offers
complacency; I offer change. He gives us slogans; We're offering
solutions to the problems American families face every day and
every week and every month.''
   He said he was offering solutions that were ``not big-money
solutions or big-government solutions.''

<HEAD>Former E.F. Hutton Employee Settles Libel Claim With Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former E.F. Hutton branch manager has
dropped a lawsuit claiming he was libeled in the brokerage firm's
1985 report about its elaborate check-kiting scheme, according to
court papers filed Monday.
   The out-of-court settlement negotiated in July by attorneys for
John M. Pearce and Hutton was approved in an order by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Flannery.
   According to court papers, each side will pay its own expenses
in the case, which was to be submitted first to arbitration by the
New York Stock Exchange before any proceedings in federal court.
   The settlement was negotiated shortly after Pearce had lost his
suit against former Attorney General Griffin Bell, who had been
hired by Hutton to investigate the check-kiting scheme and produce
a report.
   A federal court jury on June 20 absolved Bell of any civil
liability, ruling that none of the statements about Pearce in the
report was false or defamatory.
   The terms of the settlement were not made public and attorneys
for both sides refused to comment on it. ``The matter stands
resolved,'' said Stephen G. Milliken, Pearce's lawyer.
   Hutton, now part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., pleaded guilty
in 1985 to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud and agreed to pay a
$2 million fine after admitting that branch employees participated
in the overdrafting scheme.
   The company also agreed to reimburse banks for the millions of
dollars in interest that was lost when branch officers wrote checks
against funds that had not been deposited in their company accounts.
   Bell and his Atlanta law firm, King & Spalding, were hired to
conduct an internal investigation and write a report about the
check kiting scheme. The report blamed Pearce, who managed Hutton
branches in Bethesda, Md., and St. Louis, as one of six officials
responsible for the scheme.
   Pearce, now a businessman in Sarasota, Fla., claimed that Bell
and Hutton conspired to absolve top company managers by placing the
blame on mid-level executives.
   His parallel claim against Hutton was to be submitted to
arbitration under New York Stock Exchange rules.
   Bell, whose report exonerated top officials of wrongdoing, said
he couldn't find any evidence of illegal conduct by the company's
ranking officials. The report only blamed these executives for
failure to properly manage employees and detect improprieties.

<HEAD>Post in New Polish Cabinet Reported Offered to Moderate Foe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate opposition figure who founded a
group to promote private enterprise said he was offered a position
Monday in the government being formed by new Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   Unconfirmed reports said other members of the opposition also
were approached about serving in the government.
   Aleksander Paszynski, who edits a magazine for private home
builders and who founded the pro-business Economic Society, said in
a telephone interview that he was offered a position at a meeting
with Rakowski on Monday.
   The Economic Society for a year has been stymied in its bid for
official registration.
   Paszynski said Rakowski's offer concerned the Ministry of
Construction and Local Planning and the job would deal with
apartment construction. He declined to be more specific and said he
had not made up his mind whether to accept.
   ``I can say only one thing, that he (Rakowski) is really
intensively searching for new faces,'' said Paszynski. ``I can't
tell you what the results of this search are.''
   Rakowski, a member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, was
appointed prime minister on Sept. 27 and is scheduled to present
his Cabinet for approval by the Sejm, or parliament, on Oct. 13.
   Rakowski told parliament he would need two weeks to enlist
ministers with ``reformatory attitudes'' and expressed the hope his
would be a ``coalition government with a broader representation
than has been the case.''
   Rakowski succeeded Zbigniew Messner, who resigned Sept. 19 with
his entire Cabinet after the government came under heavy attack for
its handling of the economy.
   Bronislaw Geremek, a senior adviser to Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, said he heard of several attempts to enlist independent
figures for high posts in the Rakowski government, but knew of no
one who accepted.
   Geremek called the recruitment a ``strange attempt ... certain
to fail'' to circumvent planned round-table talks this month
between authorities and the opposition.
   Paszynski has been a leading advocate for the right to form
private associations. The official publication Lad quotes him in
its current issue as urging that Solidarity be made legal again and
that other groups, including his own Economic Society, be legalized.
   Solidarity, outlawed in 1982, reported that opposition activist
Jozef Pinior and three associates received suspended sentences by a
Wroclaw court on Monday for an alleged assault on a factory guard
there during a wave in strikes in May.
   Czeslaw Borowczyk was sentenced to 1{ years in prison, Pinior
and Aleksandra Sarata to one year each and Yolanta Skiba to eight
months, but all sentences were suspended for a three-year
probationary period, Pinior reported.
   They were found guilty in connection with an incident during a
May 5 factory rally at the Dolmel electric machinery plant in which
the guard was said to have suffered a broken arm.
   Pinior, a Solidarity leader in Wroclaw and a founder of the
illegal Polish Socialist Party, or PPS, denied assaulting the
guard, as did the other defendants.
   ``We treat it as pure harassment for our PPS activities,''
Pinior said of the verdict. He said the four planned to appeal.

   A man in the midst of a divorce has been
charged with trying to hire someone to take a bomb concealed in a
tape recorder to his wife in Scotland, police said Monday.
   The bomb was set to explode when the play button was pressed.
   Charles Hili, 54, a former U.S. Marine munitions expert from
Long Island, was arrested after a man answered an advertisement
Hili placed in the Irish Voice newspaper Oct. 1, seeking a ``tough
Irishman ... to handle a confidential assignment,'' police said.
   The respondent then called police, said Detective Sgt. Daniel
Severin.
   The man who answered the advertisement met with Hili under
police surveillance on Sunday.
   Hili allegedly spelled out his instructions and handed the man a
tape recorder with a bomb inside, police said.
   Hili, a self-employed lumber buyer, also made arrangements to
pay the man $2,000, he said.
   Hili is charged of criminal solicitation, criminal possession of
a weapon and conspiracy.
   The man who answered the ad was an out-of-work Irish-American
who needed money, police said.

   The League of Women Voters dropped its
sponsorship of the second presidential debate Monday in a protest
over its lack of control, and the two campaigns quickly agreed to
replace it with a bipartisan commission.
   Spokesmen for both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush said the debate would go on, probably on Oct. 13 or 14
as scheduled, with the substitute sponsor.
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which
sponsored the first debate 10 days ago in Winston-Salem, N.C., said
it accepted the campaigns' invitation and was taking steps to hold
the debate in Los Angeles, as planned.
   ``The commission is delighted to respond positively to the
invitation and regards it as a vote of confidence in the
commission's approach to the debate,'' said Janet Brown, executive
director of the commission. ``We hope to be able to make an
announcment in the next day or so about funding partners.''
   Brown said the group, which was formed by the two national
parties, was seeking ``local partners'' to help finance the debate.
   The group was invited to become the new sponsor after Dukakis
campaign chairman Paul Brountas and Bush chairman James A. Baker
III talked by telephone and agreed to ask the commission.
   The debate had been scheduled for Oct. 13 or 14, depending on
the baseball playoff schedule.
   The League's move does not affect the debate between vice
presidential nominees scheduled Wednesday evening in Omaha, Neb.
   League of Women Voters President Nancy M. Neuman announced the
pullout at a Washington news conference where she used strong
language to denounce an agreement worked about between the two
presidential campaigns for debate format, staging and other details.
   She charged it would restrict questioning of the candidates and
result in a ``charade,'' devoid of spontaneity and a true exchange
on the issues.
   ``We have no intention of becoming an accessory to the
hoodwinking of the American public,'' Neuman said.
   Both the Bush and Dukakis campaigns said the League's decision
would not jeopardize the second debate and disputed the League's
charge. They pointed to the success of the first debate at Wake
Forst University, held under the same terms.
   But it was clear that Dukakis _ the lesser known and underdog
candidate _ stood to lose the most if the League's decision denied
him the chance to meet Bush a second time before a national
television audience.
   ``I want to go forward in Los Angeles,'' Dukakis said. ``The
agreement (with the Bush campaign) provides that if for some reason
the sponsor decides to pull out, we still go ahead. I want to go
ahead.''
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said the commission agreed to sponsor
the debate under the terms rejected by the League.
   ``They have both agreed that there will be no debate after Oct.
14 and that they will continue to look at Los Angeles, but if that
is not doable we will certainly look at other places,'' Goodin said.
   ``There is going to be a second presidential debate,'' Goodin
said.
   Neuman, the League president, contended the campaigns have so
controlled the format that questioning by a panel of journalists
will be subject to ``very clear restrictions in ters of what they
can ask.''
   She said the agreement that was presented to the League last
Wednesday was ``a closed-door masterpiece'' presented as ``a done
deal.'' In a printed statement she did not read at her news
conference, she said the agreement ``would perpetrate a fraud on
the American voter'' and ``add debates to their list of
campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest
answers to tough questions.''
   The League's involvement in 1988 debates has been long an issue.
Spurred in part by discontent with the League's sponsorship of
debates in previous presidential elections, the Republican and
Democratic parties joined with the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates to sponsor them this year.
   But sponsorship itself became one of the items at issue in
hardball debate negotiations between the Dukakis and Bush
campaigns. The campaigns ultimately agreed to two debates, one
sponsored by the commission and one by the League, plus a vice
presidential debate under commission sponsorship.
   At her news conference, Neuman released copies of the detailed
agreement reached by the two campaigns. It appeared to be the
general agreement that also covered their first debate.
   She said the league objected to a number of format and staging
issues, but acknowledged that at the heart of their dispute was the
League's lack of involvement in the agreement.
   ``The issue is, who's in control of the debate,'' she said.
   The League's decision was made by its 14-member board of
trustees.
   Pressed by reporters, she said conditions for the debate were
the same as the Winston-Salem debate, and said that panel was
``able to get around'' some of the limitations placed on it.
   When asked what restrictions the journalists faced, she cited
the requirement that the moderator's script be approved by the
campaigns. She also objected to the presence of a telephone line
from each campaign's headquarters at the debate site to the
debate's television producer, and to the pattern for rebuttal and
follow up questions.
   Bush campaign officials privately belittled the League's
complaints as ``nitpicking items'' and denied an attempt to control
questioning.
   One Bush campaign source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the League's action ``guarantees they're out of the debate
business for good. They made the mistake of misunderstanding their
role.''
   The debate was scheduled for the Shrine Memorial Auditorium in
Los Angeles. While Neuman suggested a willingness to give up League
rights to the auditorium, Vicky Harian, the League's debates
director, said ``I doubt very seriously'' it would relinquish its
rights.

   A Georgia congressman, dogged by news accounts
of a grand jury investigation into drug money laundering, demanded
Monday on the House floor that he be indicted immediately ``on all
charges that may be under consideration.''
   Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., who is locked in a tight re-election
battle, said he told Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a letter
Monday that he is ``ready, able and willing to go to trial on the
day following the indictment which I now request.''
   ``Simple justice and fairness demand that I be allowed to prove
my innocence in a court of law rather than in the media,'' Swindall
said. ``Simple justice and fairness also demand that I be allowed
to prove my innocence before rather than after the Nov. 8
elections.''
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Thornburgh would
have no response to Swindall's request.
   On Friday, Swindall criticized the grand jury investigation and
suggested it might be politically motivated. U.S. Attorney Robert
Barr in Atlanta responded that the decision by his office and grand
juries in his district ``have never been, are not, and will never
be influenced or made on the basis of statements by or pressures
from third parties, including persons who may be subjects of
investigations.''
   Earlier this year, it was disclosed that a videotape had been
made of an Aug. 28, 1987, meeting Swindall had with an undercover
federal agent posing as a money launderer for underworld figures.
   Swindall was subpoenaed and testified before the grand jury in
February, but has never been charged with any crime.
   In June, Atlanta newspapers obtained tape recordings from the
investigation and published excerpts that showed Swindall continued
to pursue negotiations for a $850,000 home construction loan long
after being told it might be financed with drug money he would be
helping to launder.
   Swindall apologized for his role in the negotiations, saying he
was wrong and ashamed but would continue to seek re-election. He
also asked the House ethics committee to determine if he had
violated any law or House rule. The panel agreed to investigate,
but has not issued a ruling.
   Swindall said Monday that news that the grand jury had been
reconvened just 36 days prior to the election made him take the
``unprecedented'' request for his indictment. He is opposed by
Democrat Ben Jones.
   Swindall said newspaper stories about the investigation based on
unnamed federal sources have made it impossible for him to defend
himself.
   ``The only way I know to stop it is to throw myself at the mercy
at the court and say I waive my rights, I want an immediate
trial,'' he said. ``I will try the case myself. I will walk into
the courtroom with a simple yellow pad and I will prove my
innocence in a forum where I can prove it.''

   Moscow went to Washington, D.C., Monday, apparently intending to
return to the Soviet Union.
   Theodore and Cheryle Branch of Erie moved to the Soviet Union in
October after suffering financial setbacks. They were granted
political asylum in January, and said the Soviets gave them a
furnished apartment in Moscow, medical benefits and jobs with Radio
Moscow.
   Branch has said they did not plan to return to the United States
until a U.S. embassy official in Moscow offered to match the
Soviets' benefits plus reimburse their travel expenses if the
couple came home.
   The State Department denied Branch's claims, and Soviet embassy
spokesman Boris Malakhov declined comment.
   The Branches were accompanied Monday by a crew from KDKA-TV of
Pittsburgh, whose Evening Magazine paid for their trip, said
Carolyn McClair, spokeswoman for the feature news program.
   The Branches said last week they would be broke by Monday.
   Meanwhile, Erie businessman David Olsen, upset the Branches
would forsake their country for the Soviet Union, said Branch
bruskly rejected an offer from him and New Jersey businessman Tom
Hogan for assistance returning to Moscow.
   ``Mr. Hogan is fully prepared to pay for the flight to the USSR.
I'm fully prepared to pay any expenses to any international airport
... and whatever's necessary,'' Olsen said. ``I said I'll literally
help them pack their bags. If it was necessary, I'll physically
carry them up the ramp and put them in a seat as long as it's an
international flight.''

<HEAD>Orders to U.S. Factories Up 3.1 Percent in August</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods surged 3.1 percent in August, the government said Monday in a
report cited as more evidence the economy continues to grow at a
robust pace.
   The Commerce Department said orders rose $6.8 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $226.6 billion, rebounding from a 3.6 percent
decline in July, the worst in 18 months. Orders were up 5.4 percent
in June, the biggest jump in 17 years.
   The overall orders number has been influenced in recent months
by wide swings in orders for transportation equipment, particularly
aircraft.
   But analysts said the underlying trend is strong and indicates
that a jump in the unemployment rate from 5.4 percent in July to
5.6 percent in August may be an aberration.
   ``There has been some question in the (financial) markets as to
whether manufacturing is stalling out. ... But with the orders
situation as strong as it is, it's clear to us manufacturing
remains on a solid track,'' said Stephen S. Roach, an economist
with Morgan Stanley & Co. ``I think the economy as a whole is
continuing to display very good momentum.''
   Total orders for the first eight months of the year have
averaged $217.7 billion a month, 7.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said members of his trade group remain optimistic,
at least through the rest of 1988.
   ``Manufacturers in general don't see any slowdown in their
orders over the next three to four months,'' he said.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending in August fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $396.1 billion. Economists say rising interest rates and
high vacancy rates for many kinds of buildings have kept this
sector sluggish.
   Manufacturing has been one of the most vigorous areas of the
economy this year because export sales have boomed with the lower
value of the dollar, which makes U.S. goods more affordable on
overseas markets.
   To meet demand for exports, manufacturers have stepped up
spending on new machinery to modernize their factories. Roach said
manufacturers prior to this year had been expanding capacity at the
slowest rate since World War II, and now that they're finally
spending more they're unlikely to taper off before considerable
pent up demand is met.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods rose 6.3 percent in August
to $38.5 billion, after rising 2.1 percent in July and 12.5 percent
in June.
   ``That's an extraordinary rise,'' Roach said.
   Orders for durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, jumped 5.9 percent, following a 7.4 percent
fall in July and an 8.7 percent increase in June.
   Excluding the volatile defense goods category, orders rose 2.7
percent in August following a 0.6 percent decline a month earlier
and a 2.9 percent rise in June.
   Orders for transportation equipment, a subcategory of durable
goods, were up 19.0 percent following a drop of 22.5 percent in
July and a 33.3 percent jump in June.
   The department said the August gain in transportation to $34.8
billion, which included a 167.1 percent rise in orders for military
ships and tanks, was led by a 14.4 percent gain in aircraft and a
17.0 percent jump in motor vehicles and parts.
   In other categories, orders for primary metals including steel
fell 1.8 percent and electrical machinery was off a scant 0.1
percent after a big increase in July. Other machinery orders rose
6.3 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods were off a slight 0.1 percent to
$103.6 billion. Increases in rubber and plastics, paper and tobacco
offset declines in chemicals, petroleum, textiles and clothing.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 2.1 percent in August
following a 1.0 percent decline in July.

   Michael Dukakis had a ready comeback
Monday when an elementary school student called out the name
``Bush'' to the Democratic presidential candidate's query to the
class to name some drugs.
   ``Puts you to sleep, right?'' Dukakis ad-libbed as he bantered
with fourth and sixth graders at the Allen E. Barr school.
   Aides said they were pleased with Dukakis' freewheeling
discussion with the students, and hoped to schedule similar
appearances in the future.
   Dukakis asked the combined fourth- and sixth-grade classes if
they had learned about the dangers of drugs, and then asked them to
list a few ``bad drugs.''
   The answers: Cocaine, marijuana, ``Angel Dust,'' heroin, crack,
cigarettes, and then, yes, ``Bush.''
   After giggles had subsided, Dukakis said: ``Bush is a drug, eh?
Interesting. I hadn't thought of that. Puts you to sleep, right?.''
   When it came to listing ``good drugs,'' Dukakis took exception
to one student's mention of ``aspirin.''
   The son of physician told the youths: ``It'll put a hole in your
stomach, I think, if you take too much of it. You've got to watch
it.''
   Dukakis told the youngsters he was glad they were receiving drug
education because, ``If you're going to make a contribution to the
kind of country we want to build together, it's very, very
important. I think the earlier you can begin to discuss those kinds
of things, the better.''
   He threw the floor open to questions, saying, ``I mean, here I
am, I might be the next president of the United States, right?''
   Dukakis was asked what the best and worst parts of running for
president were.
   ``You have an opportunity to meet wonderful people all across
this country ... And if you win, it gives you a chance to make a
real difference in the lives of people,'' he said.
   ``The toughest part is it's long, it takes a lot of work, a lot
of effort. But, you know, whatever you do in this life, if you want
to do it well, you have to work at. Got to get that homework done
and pay attention ...''
   He told the class: ``I want every single one of you to have a
chance to go on to college, and to do the best that you can do. I
want you to grow up, and marry and have children and buy a little
house.''
   ``I like this class,'' Dukakis said. ``I'm going to take you
wherever I go.''
   He promised to invite them to the White House if elected.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Monday
that Iran's war reconstruction must be done without ``criminal
Soviets and world-devouring America,'' apparently rebuffing rumors
of a more open foreign policy.
   Khomeini said the country's postwar reconstruction policy should
follow the principle of his revolutionary Islamic government:
``Neither East nor West.''
   His statement, reported by Iran's official news media and
monitored in Nicosia, came in reply to a letter from Iran's top
political leaders asking for guidelines for reconstruction policy
after the 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Khomeini as telling
President Ali Khamenei, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani,
Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili and Prime Minister Hussein Musavi:
   ``The valiant people of Iran will keep their revolutionary and
sacred faith and hate in their heart and employ their flames
against criminal Soviets and world-devouring America and their
agents and will hoist the banner of the genuine Islam of (Prophet)
Mohammed throughout the world.''
   Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and
spiritual leader, told the leaders he knew they would resist
attraction to East or West, adding:
   ``I am keeping a watchful eye on the internal and external
policies of the country and as long as I am alive I will not let
the course of our real policy change. ...
   ``It is your religious duty to cut off the last vein and roots
of our country's dependence on foreigners in any field.''
   Khomeini said ``invisible hands'' in the East and West had
spread stories that certain Iranian leaders were backing down from
this position and making connections with East or West. He said the
purpose was to sow discord in the Iranian revolution.
   In what appeared to be an appeal to avoid public disagreement
over policy, Khomeini told ``my enthusiastic revolutionary
children'' not to raise questions with officials without
considering Iran's political difficulties. He said such questions
might compel officials to reveal secrets of the Islamic state.
   Evidence has emerged that some Iranian leaders, notably
Rafsanjani, believe Iran must open up to the world after years of
hostile relations with East, West and most of Iran's Arab neighbors.
   But even Rafsanjani has been careful to adhere publicly to the
ideals of the revolution and declare they must not be diluted by
more contact with the West.
   Khomeini's statement seems to come down, at least where the
economy is concerned, on the side of the hardliners led by Musavi,
who insist on tight state control of the economy and extreme
suspicion toward foreign involvement.
   But it also underlined the political uncertainty that has
gripped Iran since its sudden acceptance of a United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire that took effect Aug.20.

   A Soviet satellite burned up when entering the
Earth's atmosphere after its nuclear reactor had been fired farther
into space, the official Tass news agency reported Monday.
   It said the unmanned Cosmos-1900 spacecraft ``ceased to exist''
at 1:26 a.m. Sunday Moscow time as it hit dense layers of the
atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
   The satellite, which the Soviets said was launched for
oceanographic research, separated from its nuclear reactor on
Saturday to prevent any radiation contamination on Earth, according
to Tass.
   It said the reactor was shut down automatically and boosted into
a stable orbit at about 440 miles above Earth and would remain in
that orbit long enough for its elements to decay to a safe level of
radioactivity.
   Cosmos-1900 was launched Dec. 12, 1987 and Soviet ground
controllers lost contact with it in April. It was known the
satellite was doomed because of its declining orbit and there was
concern it might contaminate the atmosphere with radioactive waste
on re-entry.
   The Soviets have put 33 nuclear-powered satellites into space
and one re-entered Earth's atmosphere in 1978, scattering some
radioactive debris in a remote section of northwestern Canada.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Banking Committee chairman, William
Proxmire, D-Wis., on Monday proposed a parliamentary maneuver that
would, if successful, allow Congress to pass legislation permitting
bank holding companies to own securities firms.
   The Senate in March overwhelmingly passed a bill allowing
affiliates of bank holding companies to underwrite most kinds of
securities, except corporate stock.
   In the House, the Banking Committee and the Energy and Commerce
Committee have passed competing versions. Both impose more
restrictions on banks and offer fewer new powers, but the Energy
and Commerce version is the most restrictive.
   The dispute between the committees has turned into a
jurisdictional war between Energy and Commerce Chairman John
Dingell, D-Mich., and Banking Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.
   So far, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has insisted that the
two settle their differences before the banking bill comes to the
House floor.
   In a letter last week to Wright, St Germain said he and Dingell
had been unable to agree and he complained that the Dingell
committee's ``overly broad perception ... of its jurisdiction has
... paralyze(d) ... one of the most important banking acts of this
century.''
   With Congress planning to adjourn at the end of the week,
Proxmire is proposing that most of the Senate bill be attached to
an unrelated banking bill already passed by the House. Other parts
of the Senate bill could be passed separately or linked to an
unrelated securities bill sponsored by Dingell that toughens
penalties for insider trading.
   Under the Proxmire plan, the banking-securities legislation then
could be ironed out in a conference between leaders in both
chambers before coming up for a vote in the full House and Senate.
That way, the House Rules Committee would not have to make a
decision on the competing jurisdictional claims of Dingell and St
Germain.
   Also, in a move to meet the concerns of St Germain and of Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has threatened to block the
maneuver, Proxmire added a series of ``pro-consumer'' provisions to
the bill, including a requirement that banks cash government checks
for non-customers and offer ``lifeline'' banking accounts to poor
people.

   Two Navajo tribal members to life in
prison Monday for the shooting and burning deaths of two tribal
police officers who had tried to break up a party.
   Thomas Cly, 22, and Vinton Bedoni, 31, were found guilty Aug. 2
of two counts of first-degree murder, aiding and abetting and use
of a firearm in a crime.
   ``There's no question this is a crime of first-degree murder in
its most brutal form,'' U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene said
in sentencing Cly.
   Greene also sentenced both men to a pair of five-year terms for
aiding and abetting and use of a firearm. Those terms are to be
served consecutively after the concurrent life terms, Greene said.
   A third defendant, Ben Atene Jr., 24, is scheduled for a new
trial Oct. 11. The same jury that convicted Cly and Bedoni
deadlocked on Atene, and U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene
declared a mistrial.
   Charges against a fourth defendant, Marques Atene, 22, were
dismissed when prosecutors acknowledged they lacked enough evidence
to convict him.
   The four were charged in the slayings of tribal policemen Roy
Lee Stanley and Andy Begay, whose bodies were found Dec. 5, 1987,
in a burned-out police truck in a remote southern Utah canyon.
   Prosecutors said the officers were killed at the site of a
bonfire drinking party near Gouldings the night of Dec. 4. Alcohol
is prohibited on the Navajo Indian Reservation.
   The officers were trying to break up the party and became
involved in altercations with the defendants.
   In the August trial, prosecution witnesses repeatedly changed
their accounts of the crimes, and defense witnesses who placed the
accused at other locations at the time of the slayings.

   Israeli soldiers raided more than a dozen West
Bank villages Monday and wounded 22 Palestinians, hospital
officials said. A general strike against school closures virtually
shut down the occupied lands.
   The army confirmed 11 casualties. Soldiers imposed or extended
curfews on eight refugee camps and neighborhoods in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, confining more than 150,000 Palestinians to their
homes.
   Troops detained about 20 members of the anti-Arab Kach movement
who entered an ancient synagogue near the biblical town of Jericho
for the second time in two days as part of a campaign to establish
a Jewish settlement in the area, the army reported.
   Army officials said the Kach members were turned over to police
and complaints would be filed against them.
   Last week, soldiers turned back three groups from the
nationalist-religious Gush Emunim movement that tried to settle
three West Bank sites, including in Jericho.
   Dozens of Jewish settlers wearing white prayer shawls and
carrying machine guns danced and sang Monday in deserted streets of
Hebron in the West Bank.
   Israel television showed dozens of soldiers on foot and in jeeps
guarding the procession on Simhat Torah, the holiday that ends the
annual Jewish religious reading.
   Hebron has been under curfew since Friday, when a Palestinian
merchant was shot and killed during a clash between settlers and
stone-throwing Palestinians.
   A rebellion against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8 among the
1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. At
least 280 Palestinians have been killed and six Israelis also have
been slain.
   The search-and-arrest raids on the villages were timed to
coincide with the one-day strike, an army spokeswoman said.
   ``On a strike day, you know there will be violence. We wanted to
prevent it through our increased presence and by making more
arrests,'' she said.
   She said more than a dozen villages were searched, but would not
provide further details, including the number of people arrested.
   In one raid, dozens of jeeps converged on the West Bank village
of Zeita, 10 miles east of the Israeli coastal town of Hadera,
Palestinians said.
   Hundreds of masked young people blocked roads to the village
with boulders and hurled stones to stop the soldiers from entering,
said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Troops
shot and wounded four teen-agers, hospital officials said.
   The raid came one day after Zeita youths hurled bottles and
stones at several Israeli cars. The village is located near a busy
intersection where many Israeli civilian cars pass. In the nearby
West Bank town of Tulkarem, Palestinians stoned a military jeep,
and troops opened fire, wounding three teen-agers, hospital
officials said.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, 13 Palestinians were wounded in
clashes in the towns of Nablus and Jenin, and the villages of Deir
Ghassan and Rujeeb, hospital officials said. Two people were hit by
army gunfire in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   The army said one Palestinian was wounded in the Gaza Strip
refugee camp of Jebaliya and confirmed 10 wounded in the West Bank.
It said it was checking the other casualty reports.
   Throughout the occupied lands, streets were deserted and shops
shuttered as Palestinians observed the one-day strike called by
Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, a group that backs the
Palestinian Liberation Organization.
   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, outlawed Palestinian flags
fluttered from electricity poles and walls in the center of town
bore English grafitti saying ``PLO _ Israel No.''
   Manger Square, the main tourist attraction in the biblical city,
was deserted except for an army patrol.
   The strike was called to protest the extended closure of schools
and universities by Israeli military officials who claim the
institutions are a flashpoint of anti-Israeli violence.
   In the West Bank, schools have been closed almost continuously
since the start of the uprising. In the Gaza Strip, elementary
schools are open, but high schools remain closed.

<HEAD>Cold Air Across Northern Plains Put Chill on Growing Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The coldest air so far this fall spread across the north-central
states Monday, bringing an end to the growing season across much of
Minnesota and the Dakotas.
   Gusty northerly winds Monday afternoon accompanied temperatures
in the 40s and low 50s north of a Plains cold front.
   A hard freeze was forecast overnight for all of North Dakota,
with temperatures expected to drop into the low 20s. Freeze
advisories were posted for the Dakotas, western Minnesota and much
of northern Nebraska, and a frost advisory was in effect for much
of southern Nebraska.
   By early Wednesday, the cold air will slide into the South, with
readings of about 40 degrees expected around Memphis, Tenn.
   While most of the nation was dry Monday, showers and
thunderstorms _ some severe _ wet southern Georgia and much of
Florida. Lighter rain fell from South Carolina to the mid-Atlantic
states, including showers in western New York.
   A tornado touched down near Cross City, Fla., damaging trees and
downing power lines.
   Rainfall for the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included almost
2 inches at Tallahassee, Fla., and more than 1{ inches at Brunswick
and Macon, Ga., and Apalachicola, Fla.
   At Jacksonville, Fla., nearly 2 inches of rain fell in two hours
ending at 3 p.m, with almost three-quarters of an inch in 20
minutes.
   Warm and dry conditions prevailed across the nation west of the
Rockies, with afternoon temperatures mostly in the 60s and 70s but
in the 90s to about 105 degrees in the desert Southwest. From the
northern Rockies to the Great Lakes, the mercury dropped into the
40s and 50s. Readings in the 60s and 70s reached from the East
Coast across the middle and lower Mississippi Valley to the central
and southern parts of the Plains and Rockies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Ely and Duluth, Minn., to 106 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif.
   The low in the nation early Monday was 18 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Tuesday, rainshowers were forecast from the Great Lakes
across New York to New England, with snowshowers over upper
Michigan and northern Wisconsin. Scattered showers also were
expected along the Atlantic coast, with thunderstorms over Florida.
   Tuesday's highs were forecast in the 40s and 50s from New
England across the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes region and the
upper half of the Mississippi Valley to the northern and central
Plains. Readings in the 80s were predicted for Florida and from the
southern half of Texas across the Southwest, but in the 90s or low
100s in the desert.

   The previous owners of the McClures'
new house used to take their work home with them. Unfortunately,
they were coroners.
   When the McClures' cat, Puffy, started growling in the backyard
Sunday night _ their first night in the new home _ the couple went
to investigate and found 25 boxes, bags and buckets full of human
body parts.
   The labeled body parts were left behind by the former
homeowners, a pair of Riverside deputy coroners, who apparently
were doing some work for an independent laboratory, authorities
said.
   The bags and boxes were labeled with people's names, a series of
numbers and dates, and a description, such as ``stomach and
contents.''
   McClure said he picked up a plastic bag, noted the squishy feel
and carried it into the light for a better look. The label on the
bag said: ``Heart.''
   ``It was all purple. When I found out it was a heart I dropped
it,'' said McClure, a 24-year-old auto technician.
   More parcels were discovered in the garage and the back yard was
dotted with clumps of hair.
   The Coroner's Office said the previous owners, Brad and Alendra
Birdsall, were cutting up human remains for an independent
laboratory where they both work part-time.
   Brad Birdsall, who visited the McClure home Sunday afternoon to
remove some items, said he had been instructed by his supervisors
not to discuss what the tissue samples were doing at the house.
   ``Suffice it to say it's for legitimate reasons,'' he said.
   The Birdsalls had left the McClures a note, written on a paper
towel and dated Oct. 1, that advised the new homeowners that some
property belonging to the Birdsalls remained at the home.
   ``We still occupy half the garage, the covered patio, part of
the brick patio (under the olive tree) and still have our tools in
the shed,'' the note stated. ``Call us if there are any problems.''
   Supervising Deputy Coroner Dan Cupido said his office had no
policy forbidding employees from working on human remains at their
homes, but an investigation could lead to a change in policy.
   The discoveries don't place any previous autopsies in doubt,
Cupido said.
   The McClures paid $85,000 for the house.
   ``The wife, she's so upset she's saying she wishes we hadn't
bought the house,'' McClure said.

   The wife of U.S. hostage Alann Steen said
she was still awaiting word on the fate of her husband, who was
rumored to be released Monday by Moslem captors who released
another man instead.
   ``We have not received confirmation of anything yet,'' Virginia
Steen said from her parents' home in Clark Lake in Jackson Couny.
The U.S. State Department is ``waiting like we are for any
confirmation coming out of Beirut or Damascus.''
   The release of Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a visiting finance
professor, followed press reports that Steen, 49, a journalism
professor, was about to be released.
   Steen, Singh and two other American teachers were kidnapped Jan.
24, 1987, by gunmen posing as riot police at the campus of Beirut
University College, where they taught.
   Mrs. Steen said she talked to State Department representatives,
but she did not say what was discussed.
   Nine Americans are missing in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.

<HEAD>Israel's Surrogate Militia Supports Christian Cabinet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Lebanese general who runs
Israel's ``security zone'' in south Lebanon declared support Monday
of the Christian slate in Lebanon's paralyzed, two-Cabinet
government.
   ``The Cabinet formed by President (Amin) Gemayel under army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun is the legitimate government,'' former
Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd said in his first public comment on the
situation.
   Lahd spoke at a news conference broadcast by the Voice of Hope,
the radio station of his South Lebanon Army militia.
   When Gemayal's term ended Sept. 23 without a successor having
been chosen by Parliament, Gemayel appointed Aoun, a fellow
Maronite Christian, prime minister of a six-man military government.
   Three Moslem officers named to the Aoun Cabinet refused.
Lebanon's Moslem majority rejected the Christian Cabinet and
declared the incumbent government of acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem, the legitimate authority.
   That caused one of Lebanon's biggest political crises since
independence from France in 1943. By unwritten agreement, Lebanon's
president always has been a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni
Moslem and the speaker of Parliament a Shiite Moslem.
   Lahd held his news conference at Jizzine, the largest Christian
town in south Lebanon, which has a population of 30,000. It is 25
miles south of Beirut in the northern tip of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone, which the South Lebanon Army patrols
with the aid of Israeli soldiers.
   ``We shall not be handcuffed in dealing with any danger that
threatens Lebanon's existence and unity. We shall take active
measures to restore unity and legitimacy to the nation,'' Lahd
said, without elaborating.
   Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal and
Justice minister in the Hoss government, was quoted as saying
afterward: ``If some in the security zone began threatening
military measures, we affirm that we were and still are against any
military actions.''
   Asked whether Parliament will convene to elect a new president
soon, Berri was quoted by Voice of Lebanon radio as saying: ``There
will be no elections. We do not need them (the Christians).
   ``We need one government, at least in the current stage, that
will unite the country and form a new (political) system. It is not
required to have a president who will rule without
responsibilities.''
   Israel controls a six- to 10-mile-deep strip of land in south
Lebanon as a buffer zone against guerrillas trying to infiltrate
Israel.

<TEXT>
   Novelist and Oscar-nominee Jerry
Gustav Hasford pleaded innocent Monday to felony charges he stole
thousands of books from libraries in the United States and England.
   Hasford, 41, of San Clemente pleaded innocent to two counts of
grand theft and a single charge of possession of stolen property.
   Superior Court Judge Harry Woolpert set a Dec. 5 trial date and
ordered pre-trial hearings to begin on Dec. 1.
   Hasford shared an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay
adaptation for ``Full Metal Jacket,'' a 1987 movie based on his
novel ``The Short-Timers.''
   Prosecutors contend Hasford stole more than $20,000 worth of
books from libraries in London, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Luis
Obispo, St. Louis and Longview, Wash., said Deputy District
Attorney Teresa Estrada-Mullaney.
   Campus police at California State Polytechnic University here
served Hasford with a search warrant on March 17. They were looking
for 87 books overdue on his library card.
   The officers discovered about 10,000 books, allegedly stolen and
stashed in a rented storage unit. Prosecutors have not tried to
explain what motive Hasford may have had. The books are believed to
have been checked out or stolen from as many as 70 libraries
worldwide.
   The books were primarily Civil War research volumes, Ms.
Estrada-Mullaney said.
   The charges relate only to a portion of those 10,000 books. It
is unlikely Hasford will be charged in connection with the
remainder of the books, she said.

   The head of NATO said Monday that the
leadership upheaval and other sweeping changes under way in the
Soviet Union offer the West a mixed picture, but ``there is still
more continuity than change.''
   ``The aim of Soviet reform efforts is, of course, not to please
the West. Nor do the Soviets intend to abandon their own system,''
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner told the Royal Institute of
International Relations in Brussels.
   ``On the contrary, the basic objective is to make the present
system work more efficiently and thus to enhance the credibility
and authority of the Communist Party.''
   Woerner, former West German defense minister, said the West
should welcome Soviet reform programs that promise greater freedom
for citizens.
   ``It is not in our interest to see the present reform programs
fail ...,'' he said. ``Stable and improved relations will require
predictability in the behavior of all countries involved.''
   Woerner said in prepared remarks that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``faces considerable problems in his efforts to modernize
the Soviet society. But he pursues his objective with energy and
determination, as last week's events in Moscow demonstrate.''
   Gorbachev late last week led the most dramatic political changes
in Soviet leadership of his 3{ years in power, including his
election as the country's president to replace Andrei Gromyko.
   In addition, Gorbachev has pushed policies of glasnost, or
openness, and perestroika, or reform. He also has pressed for
improved relations with the United States and other members of the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense alliance.
   President Reagan and Gorbachev last December signed the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty that provides for
elimination over three years of medium-range nuclear weapons.
   East and West negotiators also are pursuing discussions on
reducing conventional arms in Europe.
   ``There can be no doubt that there has been a shift in Soviet
attitudes and positions,'' Woerner said. ``Nevertheless, the
present picture is a mixed one.''
   ``There is still more continuity than change. The Soviets are
more actively pursuing arms control. But at the same time the
modernization of nuclear as well as conventional forces facing
Europe continues unabated.''
   ``There is a strong push for economic reform,'' he said. ``But
military expenditures remain at a level far beyond defensive
requirements.''
   He defended NATO against criticism it has been slow to respond
to Gorbachev's push and lacks a comprehensive strategy for pursuing
East-West relations.
   ``I strongly disagree with this perception. The achievements of
the last few years have come in response to our proposals and
determination,'' he said.
   Woerner said the West should encourage East bloc leaders in
their policy changes and be ready for greater cooperation.
   ``But in the end,'' he said, ``future developments will depend
on these leaders themselves, and in particular on the Soviets.''
   ``They must demonstrate,'' he said, ``that they are not merely
seeking a breathing space, but a permanently improved relationship
between East and West at a lower and more balanced level of
forces.''
   He cautioned that despite reform programs, ``Soviet military
capabilities and posture remain the same. We cannot base our
security on declared intentions which may rapidly change.
   ``A prudent insurance policy requires a defense based on a sober
evaluation of Warsaw Pact capabilities. And if we are to further
reduce the level of arms on both sides, we must have the political
determination required to keep the remaining forces _ nuclear as
well as conventional _ strong and up-to-date.''

<TEXT>
   Police on Monday arrested the leader of the
militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue on the eve of the
organization's ``siege of Atlanta'' _ intensive picketing to
blockade the city's abortion clinics.
   As those seeking to outlaw abortion prepared to renew
demonstrations that began during the Democratic National
Convention, activists who say the decision to end a pregnancy
should be a woman's, not the state's, readied their own
countermeasures.
   Like armies girding for battle, both sides planned rallies
Monday evening to arouse supporters.
   Randall Terry of Operation Rescue was arrested shortly after he
addressed a group of his supporters, who plan to block entrances to
clinics for four days beginning Tuesday morning.
   He was charged with conspiracy to commit a crime and jailed
under a $75,000 bond pending a hearing Tuesday afternoon, said
police Sgt. Dorothy Smith.
   Atlanta officials have vowed tough law enforcement to keep
demonstrations or any confrontations between the two sides from
getting out of hand.
   Abortion foes scheduled its rally at St. Jude's Catholic Church
in suburban Sandy Springs. Its goal, said spokeswoman Judi Loesch,
was to ``rev people up (and) give people the information they
need'' for the demonstrations.
   Pro-choice forces, meanwhile, planned a service at Central
Presbyterian Church across from the state Capitol in memory of a
woman who died from a back-street abortion.
   The program was to include speeches by Bill Baird, a longtime
advocate of a woman's right to choose and the owner of clinics in
New York; National Organization of Women President Molly Yard, and
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League.
   Organizers of Operation Rescue's so-called ``siege of Atlanta''
predict hundreds of their supporters will take part in blockading
the seven clinics in Atlanta where abortions are performed.
   Abortion rights groups, led by the Georgia Abortion Rights
League, have trained about 300 people to help escort women through
picket lines outside the clinics, said executive director Sally
Tyler.
   Also, a hearing is set Tuesday on the city's request for a court
injunction declaring anti-abortion pickets ``public nuisances'' and
forbidding them from blocking clinics or coming within 15 feet of
anyone seeking to enter a clinic.
   Ms. Tyler said pro-choice groups will not stage any
counterdemonstration outside the clinics because it ``makes it
harder on the individual woman; it becomes more confusion. ... it's
just more of a mob scene.''
   Operation Rescue, a New York-based organization, led 17
demonstrations in Atlanta beginning during the Democratic National
Convention in July. More than 700 people were arrested during those
demonstrations, many of them remaining in jail for up to 70 days
because they refused to give their names and identified themselves
instead as Baby John Doe or Baby Jane Doe. Three remain in jailed.
   Pro-choice groups scheduled Monday's rally ``because it is on
the eve of the return of Operation Rescue to Atlanta,'' Ms. Tyler
said.
   In addition, Monday was the 11th anniversary of the death of
Rosie Jimenez, who Ms. Tyler said was the first woman to die from a
cut-rate abortion after Congress cut off Medicaid funds for
abortions in 1977.

   President P.W. Botha will not
go to Zambia this week to confer with leaders of other African
nations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roland Darroll said Monday.
   His statement came in response to reports that Botha planned to
go to Lusaka, Zambia, to meet with President Kenneth Kaunda and
several other black African leaders.
   Botha has visited Mozambique, Malawi and Zaire over the past
three weeks for meetings that were seen as a breakthrough for
white-dominated South Africa.
   Botha told a public meeting Monday night in the town of George
in Cape province signs emerged of ``greater understanding and
cooperation but leaders of southern Africa still have to take the
great step in getting together.''
   ``Over many years the perception has developed that South Africa
is a belligerent country in an antagonist region,'' he said.
``Events in recent months have questioned the validity of this
perception.''
   Botha noted labor-market, scientific and technological links
between his country and its neighbors and said, ``A strong basis
for cooperation already exists between South Africa and the other
states in the region.''
   Malawi is the only African country that has formal diplomatic
ties with South Africa but some other countries have trade missions.
   South Africa has been politically isolated because of its policy
of apartheid.
   By South African laws and customs, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Hundreds Fell in September Fighting in El Salvador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Combat between government
forces and leftist guerrillas resulted in hundreds of casualties
last month, according to military and rebel reports issued Monday.
   The armed forces press office listed 88 rebels killed and 117
wounded in September and said 65 soldiers died and 141 were wounded.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
claimed to have inflicted 1,062 casualties on forces of the
U.S.-backed government last month, which saw the beginning of a
rebel drive called ``Death to Reagan's (Salvador) Policy, Yankee
out of El Salvador.''
   Radio Venceremos, the rebels' clandestine radio, said the deaths
of 78 troops was confirmed.
   The rebels do not usually provide figures on their own
casualties.
   Guerrillas early Monday attacked a branch of the state-run Banco
Capitalizador in Atiquizaya, 42 miles west of San Salvador, the
armed forces said.
   A communique said the branch was sacked and burned in the
pre-dawn raid, and that two national policemen were wounded
fighting the rebels.
   Bank manager Francisco Rodriguez told journalists the guerrillas
took about $48,000.
   The communique also reported that government forces kIlled five
rebels and wounded two in fighting Sunday in northeastern Morazan
province.
   No way exists to independently verify casualty figures reported
by either side in the 9-year-old war. Evidence indicates both sides
inflate the number of casualties inflicted on the enemy, while
underreporting their own casualties. Radio Venceremos said 450
soldiers were killed or wounded in what it described as the
``annihilation'' of the 4th Army Brigade headquarters in
Chalatenango province on Sept. 13.
   Reporters who visited the brigade that day saw damage from rebel
mortar fire but no evidence the base had been overrun. The
government said 15 soldiers and six guerrillas were killed in that
attack.
   The guerrilla claim for September was nearly double that of
August, when the rebels said they caused 544 government casualties.
   Rebel reports do not separate dead and wounded.
   About 65,000 people have died in the war, most of them civilians.

   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal presented the
documents certifying Saudi adherence to the treaty at a ceremony
attended by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and United Nations
officials.
   The United States is one of the countries authorized under the
treaty to receive such documents.
   U.S. officials said Saudi officials told Shultz earlier this
year of their intention to subscribe to the treaty, under which
signatory nations promise not to acquire a nuclear weapons
capability, among other requirements.
   The Reagan administration had been somewhat concerned about
Saudi Arabia's intentions after the monarchy acquired CSS2 missiles
from China. The Chinese had never exported the weapon previously
and had equipped its own arsenal with nuclear warheads, according
to U.S. officials who asked not to be identified.
   However, Saudi officials have assured the United States that the
missiles they imported from China are not equipped with nuclear
warheads.
   Israel has long been concerned about Saudi Arabia's intentions
because of the proximity of the two countries. Israel has not
signed the treaty.
   `The United States is extremely pleased that Saudi Arabia has
joined the community of nations embraced by the treaty,'' State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   He called the accord ``the most widely supported arms control
treaty in history.
   ``The broad consensus among mankind that the spread of nuclear
weapons is a danger that can and must be avoided,'' Redman said.
   ``With its accession to the treaty today, Saudi Arabia is
strengthening the global non-proliferation regime, demonstrating
its peaceful intentions in the region.''
   Redman expressed hope that all states which have not yet joined
the treaty will decide to do so.
   Shultz spent the day conferring with high-ranking Arab
diplomats, including Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   Redman said both countries agreed on the importance of expanding
relations after an extended period of acrimony generated by U.S.
allgeations that Iraq used chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels.
   He said Aziz repeated his Sept. 17 statement in which he
promised to abide by commitments Iraq has undertaken concerning
chemical weapons. The Reagan administration has said it interprets
that statement to mean Iraq forswears the use of such weaponry.
   Speaking briefly with reporters after meeting Shultz, Aziz said
there were ``no complaints'' from the U.S. side about chemical
weapons use.
   Iraq denied engaging in chemical warfare against the Kurds but
the Reagan administration said it had evidence to the contrary.
   Iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons against Iran in
their 8-year-old war.

<HEAD>Woman Flees Town Amid `Devil Worship' Hysteria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors that a woman was taking pictures of
prospective devil-worship victims got so out of hand that an
artist-in-residence said she fled for fear of her own safety.
   ``I've never seen such hysteria over nothing,'' said Janice
Braverman, a Cincinnati photographer. She suggested she became the
rumor's target because she was a stranger in town, and frantic
parents and a school principal failed to determine the truth.
   ``When I was fleeing town with my wet negatives, my mind went
back to the Salem witch trials, and I just couldn't believe that
that kind of hysteria could happen today, and I could understand
how it could happen then,'' Ms. Braverman said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press late Monday.
   ``I'm not a threatening-looking person. I'm 5 feet tall,'' said
Ms. Braverman, 36. ``I wasn't wearing black. I don't have jaggy
eyebrows or long fingernails.''
   Ms. Braverman arrived in Irvine in eastern Kentucky in
mid-September to start a one-year photography project under a
$10,000 grant from the Kentucky Arts Council.
   Rumors that devil worshipers were searching for blond, blue-eyed
victims for sacrifices reached the town from surrounding counties
about the same time.
   Ms. Braverman says that when she visited Estill County High
School to discuss the photo program with principal Russell Bowen,
she ran into four girls in a restroom skipping class.
   She told them about the project and they seemed interested.
   ``These were the kinds of kids I wanted to reach,'' Ms.
Braverman said in an interview with The Kentucky Post, a Covington
newspaper. ``The ones who might not do well in school and get
discouraged _ they drop out or skip classes.''
   She photographed them mugging for the camera in front of the
mirrors and showed them how to take pictures.
   By the weekend, rumors were circulating that a woman was taking
pictures of blonde-haired, blue-eyed girls, potential victims for
devil worshipers.
   Ms. Braverman went to Bowen's office the following Monday, Sept.
12, with Estill County Arts Project director Betty Holbrook, who
helped arrange the photography project.
   Bowen came out of his office yelling and screaming, Mrs.
Holbrook said.
   ``Janice tried to ask him what was the problem, could he tell
her what was wrong. He absolutely refused to talk to her,'' Mrs.
Holbrook said. ``He threatened to have us arrested and thrown off
the school grounds.''
   Mrs. Holbrook said the principal chased them from the building,
shaking his fist and screaming: ``Get out. Get out.''
   Superintendent William Alexander later told them that two
parents talked to Bowen about the pictures taken in the restroom
and that Bowen somehow linked Ms. Braverman to the rumors, Mrs.
Holbrook said.
   Asked by the newspaper if he discussed the matter with Ms.
Braverman, Bowen said: ``Did I talk with her? I don't have to talk
with anyone. To you or anyone else.'' He then hung up.
   ``He could have calmed things down,'' Ms. Braverman said.
``Instead he fanned the fears.''
   ``I thought I could give those students something, get them
excited about something,'' she said. ``Now I'm waking up from
nightmares. I don't know if I ever want to teach again. You can
turn around and find yourself accused of something for no reason at
all.''
   Alexander declined comment Monday. ``As far as I'm concerned,
the issue here is closed ... and that's where I'd prefer to leave
it,'' he said.
   Alexander said no action would be taken against any school
officials.
   The widespread rumors apparently began after authorities in
Breathitt County arrested six people in late July stemming from a
grave robbery that Jackson police said appeared to be related to
devil worship.
   Rumors that Satan worshipers would massacre students in Caldwell
County schools sparked what a police official called a ``mass
panic'' Sept. 16, when about half of the district's 2,400 students
left school.
   In West Virginia, officials in Sissonville blamed teen-agers
with overactive imaginations for rumors last week that a satanic
cult was searching for a blond, blue-eyed child for human sacrifice.

<HEAD>Designer of Mini Car Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUDREY WOODS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Alec Issigonis, designer of the box-like Mini
car that brought economical motoring to millions of Britons, has
died at age 81, the London Times reported.
   Issigonis, who also designed the immensely popular and
long-lived Morris Minor, died at his home in Edgbaston, Birmingham,
on Sunday, a death notice in Tuesday's editions of the Times said.
   No cause of death was announced but for years Issingonis
suffered from Parkinson's disease. He retired in 1971 but continued
working as a consultant to the Rover Group until a year ago.
   More than 5 million Minis, planned as ``a box on wheels,'' have
been built since they were introduced in 1959, setting a new
standard for small-car design.
   A 10-foot-long box, it weighed about 1,300 pounds and sold for
less than $1,500.
   It was just the car for the swinging sixties, a favorite with
aristocrats, film stars and the bell-bottomed and mini-skirted
young people who could, at last, afford a car.
   Despite embellishments and refinements, its outward appearance
has never greatly changed. The price has multiplied almost tenfold,
but sales are still buoyant.
   Said Issingonis in 1986: ``Oddly enough, I don't think I'm
proudest of the Mini. I think it was the Morris Minor, the first
all-British car to pass the 1 million mark.''
   That doughty little car, produced between 1948 and 1971, still
bowls along highways all over Britain, cherished and coddled by
owners who shun any thought of driving anything else.
   Its snub-nosed plainness, little changed throughout its
production years, retains an aura of tradition and sober
reliability. The wood-paneled station wagons and sprightly
convertibles are much sought after in the 1980s.
   About 100,000 are still on British roads. Thousands survive in
India and Pakistan, and Sri Lankans drive an estimated 45,000 of
them in various stages of decay.
   Issigonis was born on Nov. 18, 1906, in Smyrna, then part of
Turkey, and came to Britain with his widowed mother following the
1922 war between Turkey and Greece.
   After studying engineering in London, he joined Morris Motors in
1936 and built a lightweight hill-climb car to demonstrate the
potential of all-independent suspension.
   His first complete production car was the Morris Minor.
   After working at Alvis in the early 1950s, Issigonis returned to
what had become BMC to design and produce a small, economical car _
the Mini.
   The result was radical for the time _ a transverse engine
powering the front wheels.
   In 1967, Issigonis was named a fellow of the Royal Society,
Britain's most prestigious scientific establishment. He was
knighted in 1969.
   Issigonis was not married

   The State Department, confirming the release
Monday of an Indian hostage by kidnappers in Lebanon, said, ``We
are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has any information to
share with us'' about the nine Americans held in Lebanon.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Mithileshwar Singh, who is a
permanent resident of the United States, was in Syrian hands in
Beirut and would be taken to Damascus early Tuesday morning.
   Syrian officials later said that Singh arrived in Damascus early
Tuesday and would spend the night in a government rest house before
being turned over to U.S. officials.
   ``We join with Mr. Singh's relatives in rejoicing in his release
and call for the urgent, unconditional release of all hostages in
Lebanon,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The spokeswoman said she did not how he was freed or his
condition.
   Mrs. Oakley said Syria notified the U.S. embassy in Beirut and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is at the United Nations
in New York, of Singh's release.
   ``He'll be transported tomorrow to Damascus, and at that point
we will consult with him whether he wants to take advantage of the
facilities at Wiesbaden,'' she said.
   The United States maintains a hospital at the military base in
West Germany.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there would be no
comment from the White House until Singh had been turned over to
American authorities by Syria on Tuesday.
   The release had been expected at 2 p.m. EDT, and then at 3 p.m.
After two more hours of anxious waiting, Mrs. Oakley made the
announcement in the State Department newsroom at 5 p.m.
   Singh was released at 10:05 p.m. local time, 3:05 p.m. EDT,
across the street from the Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees, said a police
spokesman in Beirut who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We can confirm,'' Mrs. Oakley said, ``that the Syrian
government has told us they have custody of a hostage, an Indian
citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States.''
   She then identified the freed hostage as Singh, a visiting
professor at Beirut University College. ``We understood the Syrians
intend to transport Mr. Singh to Damascus on Tuesday morning,''
Mrs. Oakley said.
   Asked if there were indications other hostages would be
released, the spokeswoman said: ``No. This is all we have.''
   Singh's wife, Lalmoney, is in Beirut, and Singh, 60, will be
turned over the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Edward Djerejian, Mrs.
Oakley said.
   Although Singh is an Indian citizen, he is a permanent resident
of the United States and ``was associated'' with the Americans who
taught at the college, she said.
   The release came after kidnappers holding Singh and three
American teachers said they would free one of their captives at the
west Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian refugees.
   The announcement that a hostage would be freed from Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine came in a 36-word handwritten
statement in Arabic delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.
   President Reagan created a stir in New York a week ago when he
suggested that something was in the works regarding the Americans
held hostage by various pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.
   He said at the time that he could not say anything further
because ``you don't talk while a no-hitter is being pitched.''
   Fitzwater said later that the president had no special
information and was merely saying he didn't want to cast bad luck
on the situation.
   Earlier Monday, Fitzwater disclosed that a third-party
government had told the United States that there might be a hostage
released.
   Neither Reagan nor Fitzwater would speculate on possible motives
behind such a hostage release, although both steadfastly denied
that the U.S. government had been negotiating to win the liberation
of the Americans.
   During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with visiting
Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga, Reagan said no release would
take place ``on the basis of negotiations of any kind. We have done
nothing of that kind.''
   The three educators believed still held by Islamic Jihad, all
captured Jan. 24, 1987, are:
   Alann Steen, a journalism professor at Beirut University
College; Jesse Turner, a visiting professor at the school, and
Robert Pohill, an assistant business professor.
   Nearly four months after they were taken captive, Turner said in
a videotape released by Islamic Jihad that Steen was suffering from
high blood pressure, was in ``pitiful'' health and was expected to
die at any moment despite being under a doctor's care.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella group
for kidnappers holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Besides the three kidnapped with Singh in January 1987, these
six Americans are also held hostage in Lebanon:
   _Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985. Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility.
   _Thomas Sutherland, the dean of agriculture at the American
University in Beirut. He was taken prisoner June 9, 1985; Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
   _Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller of the university,
kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice Organization
said it took Cicippio prisoner.
   _Frank Herbert Reed, director of the private Lebanon
International School, taken hostage Sept. 9, 1986. The pro-Libyan
Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Moukhtar Forces took responsibility.
   _Edward Austin Tracy, an author of children's books. He was
seized on Oct. 21, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice Organization
said he was its prisoner.
   _Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, head of a 75-man observer
group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, was kidnapped
Feb. 17, 1988. The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth, believed to be a Hezbollah-affiliated group, claimed
Higgins' abduction.

   Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon freed Indian
educator Mithileshwar Singh, a resident alien of the United States,
after holding him hostage for more than 20 months and Singh was
taken to Syria early Tuesday.
   The kidnappers, who still hold three American colleagues of
Singh, released the Indian professor in southern Beirut on Monday
night and Syrian intelligence officers drove him to Damascus.
   He was taken to a government guest house where two doctors
examined him, according to a government official who spoke on
condition he not be identified. The official said the examination
was ``a normal routine'' and gave no details.
   He said Singh talked by telephone with the U.S. ambassador in
Damascus, Edward Djerjian, and would be turned over to the
ambassador later Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry.
   In Beirut, Singh's wife choked back tears as she told reporters:
``This is a happy day for me, but I still did not see him. I want
to see him.''
   Singh, 60, was released at 10:05 p.m. across the street from the
Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that aids
Palestinian refugees, a Lebanese police spokesman said.
   He was freed five minutes after a deadline set by Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine, which still holds three American
college teachers kidnapped with Singh at Beirut University College
in Moslem west Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987. The kidnappers posed as
police officers.
   Nine Americans are among the 17 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In Washington, the State Department said ``we are anxious to
talk to him (Singh) and learn if he has any information to share
with us'' about the other captives.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said: ``We join with Mr. Singh's
relatives in rejoicing in his release and call for the urgent,
unconditional release of all hostages in Lebanon.''
   Syrian intelligence officers and plainclothes secret service
agents took Singh into their custody in front of the former Kuwaiti
Embassy building facing the UNRWA headquarters in Bir Hassan on
Beirut's southern outskirts, police reported. About 7,500 Syrian
soldiers are stationed in west Beirut.
   Nasser Qaddor, Syrian minister of state for foreign affairs, had
said in Damascus Monday night that an American hostage was freed
and in Syrian hands.
   Singh holds an Indian passport and an American green card that
makes him a legal resident alien of the United States.
   Earlier reports by the CBS and NBC television networks and a
Christian radio station in Beirut said American teacher Alann
Steen, 49, a native of Boston and one of those kidnapped with
Singh, was the man to be released.
   A 36-word handwritten statement in Arabic delivered to a Western
news agency Monday said the hostage would be freed by 10 p.m.
   Accompanying the statement was a photograph showing U.S. hostage
Jesse Turner, 41, a native of Boise, Idaho, shaking hands with
Singh while Steen and Robert Polhill, 54, of New York City, the
fourth captive, smiled as if bidding the Indian farewell.
   Their wives waited for news at Mrs. Turner's apartment on the
Beirut University College campus.
   ``We are listening to the radios. Insha'allah, insha'allah (God
willing) these rumors come true. It's a good sign whoever is
released,'' Badr Turner, a Lebanese, said in a telephone interview.
   The kidnappers said in a statement released Saturday they would
free one hostage as a goodwill gesture and to stimulate U.S.
support for the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   They urged the families of the hostages to be in Beirut for the
release. The comment apparently was directed at Steen's wife,
Virginia-Rose, who is vacationing with her parents in the United
States. She is expected back in Beirut on Wednesday.
   Gunmen kidnapped the educators from Beirut University College
campus, where Singh taught finance.
   Steen taught journalism at the school and his wife, 31, of
Jackson, Mich., is a fine arts instructor there.
   Turner taught mathematics and computer science and Polhill was a
business teacher and lecturer in accounting.
   Singh was born in Varanasi, India, Dec. 13, 1927. He taught
eight years at the University of Agra and eight years at the
University of Gorakhpur before moving to the United States in 1965
for graduate work at the University of Oregon in Eugene.
   He obtained a master's degree in business adminstration from the
University in Oregon in 1968 and a doctorate from Western Colorado,
an independent-study institution that operated from 1970 to 1983 in
Grand Junction, Colo., according to Beirut University College.
   After teaching at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville;
Milton College, Wis., and Western Colorado, he joined the Beirut
University College faculty in 1983.

   Two state troopers in charge of a police
academy training program that put 16 cadets in the hospital said
their farewells Monday as they prepared to turn their jobs over to
new instructors.
   Also Monday, the state Department of Public Safety ordered its
police academies to stop using pushups and other exercise as
punishment in training cadets. The Agawam police academy was closed
Sept. 21 for an investigation.
   One cadet remained in a coma after collapsing on his first day
at the Agawam academy, which trains police for cities in western
Massachusetts. Others suffered dehydration and kidney failure,
doctors said.
   Troopers Charles Blake Gilmore and John M. Richardson ended
official duties at the academy Monday. On Tuesday, they will
transfer the academy's physical training program to state police
Lt. William J. Shea and Trooper James Ryan.
   The two men asked to be reassigned Friday because of the
attention the academy has received since members of their class
began collapsing two weeks ago.
   ``They will not have further contact with the class,'' said Jeff
Grossman of the Department of Public Safety.
   One cadet, Timothy Shepard, 25, remained in a coma Monday at a
Pittsburgh hospital where he underwent a liver transplant. Fifteen
other cadets were hospitalized when they reported to doctors on
their own or on the orders of the troopers.
   Several trainees showed signs of dehydration, exhaustion and
kidney failure, doctors said.
   A team of 15 doctors, professors and police chiefs was preparing
for an examination of the training practices that may have caused
the ailments.
   One member of the team named by the Massachusetts Criminal
Justice Training Council, the group of 22 law enforcement officials
that runs the Agawam academy, said Monday she doubted that anything
but overexercise could have caused the illnesses.
   ``There are data on military recruits who suffered acute renal
failure from overexertion,'' said Priscilla Clarkson, a University
of Massachusetts researcher on muscle damage.
   ``In fairness to the instructors,'' Ms. Clarkson said, ``they
may not have known how strenuous the exercise was. It's a matter of
knowing what kind of damage the type of exercise you're doing can
cause. Some are particularly effective at inducing muscle damage
without giving an immediate sign.''
   Some cadets reported undergoing 10{ hours of exercise the first
day of class with relatively little water. Police chiefs who sent
trainees to the academy have said water was available, but the
cadets may have hesitated to break ranks to ask for it.
   Another investigation, by the state attorney general's office,
entered its second week Monday. Spokeswoman Mary Breslauer said
nine investigators were still talking to witnesses.

<HEAD>Philippines Foreign Minister Calls For Debt Rescheduling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of the Philippines
called Monday for creditor nations to reschedule or even forgive
the debts owed by Third World countries.
   Raul S. Manglapus also called the United States a ``hegemonic
power'' that he said could ease the debt crisis but had not done so.
   Manglapus devoted his entire speech to the General Assembly to
the economic policies of the industrialized countries and accused
them of perpetuating and increasing the debt of Third World nations.
   ``It is valuable to reschedule debt, but it is even more
precious and human to forgive debt,'' he said.
   Manglapus proposed the creation of an International Debt and
Development Commission to evaluate alternative plans for global
debt management and said the commission staff could be drawn from
other international financial agencies.
   He said the commission should develop standards for debt relief
or debt forgiveness and propose them to the United nations for
``approval, proclamation and execution.''
   ``There is one hegemonic power today that could crack the whip,
the United States of America,'' he said. ``But the crisis is
enormous and there are rising economic powers with which the
enforcer must coordinate if order and resolution are to be reached.
This is not happening.''
   Referring to the industrialized North and developing South,
Manglapus said the North should not blame imports from the South
for unemployment and other economic problems and should instead
stop competing with the South.
   He said the North should get out of manufacturing and exporting
textiles, garments and shoes because they are ``economic activities
in which the North has no economic advantage.''
   The debt crisis is not only a problem for the debtor but also
for ``the creditor, a problem for the world,'' he said.
``Therefore, the solution cannot be sectoral. It must be total. It
cannot be regional, it must be global.''
   Manglapus praised U.N. achievements in peacekeeping and called
on the world body to play a larger role in resolving Third World
debt.
   ``What is this debt crisis but a monstrous threat to peace?'' he
said. ``Today the debt of nation to nation is not developing man.
It is killing man.''

   Michael Dukakis made a rare visit to Chicago's
South side and told black supporters Monday that George Bush would
lead an America ``where the very rich get even richer and the rest
of us just get by.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee opened a speech at the Regal
Theater on Chicago's South Side with a tribute to the late Mayor
Harold Washington and Dukakis' former rival in the presidential
race, Jesse Jackson.
   Then, repeatedly using the phrase ``aim high,'' Dukakis promised
an administration that would enforce civil rights laws and provide
same-day voter registration; pick judges committed to equality;
improve the quality of inner city schools; and assist
minority-owned small businesses.
   ``In a few short weeks, the American people will choose between
two fundamentally different futures, two different roads to
travel,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``One road leads to an
America of privilege _ an America where the very rich get even
richer and the rest of us just get by. This is George Bush's
America.
   ``The other road leads to an America of hope and opportunity for
all our citizens,'' Dukakis said. ``My friends, I want to lead
America on that high road of hope and opportunity. I want to lead
America into a new decade and a new era of greatness.''
   Aides said it was the first venture by a presidential candidate
to Chicago's South Side since Jimmy Carter in 1976.
   Dukakis, as he did earlier in the day during a rally in
Hartford, Conn., revealed no new proposals and instead touched on
familiar initiatives. On both occassions he used the ``best
America'' theme to end his speech, as he ended his closing
statement at the recent debate with Bush.
   In between the Connecticut and Chicago stops, Dukakis stopped in
Dearborn Heights outside Detroit to speak to students about drug
use and help destroy about $100,000 worth of marijuana, cocaine and
heroin by tossing it into a county incinerator.
   ``If you think America should settle for the bronze medal, then
you vote for Bush and (Dan) Quayle,'' a shirtsleeved Dukakis told
the Hartford rally.
   ``But if you believe, as I do, that America and Americans should
go for the gold _ in the classrooms, in the workplace and in the
world economy _ then your ticket on Nov. 8 is Mike Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen.''
   Alluding to the Discovery's successful space mission, Dukakis
said that just as President Kennedy made the decision to send
Americans to the moon, the next president would have to restore
U.S. leadership in the world marketplace.
   ``John Kennedy raised the Stars and Stripes until they literally
reached the moon,'' he said. ``I want to stamp the Stars and
Stripes on American products all over the globe.''
   Raising his voice to be heard over chanting Bush supporters,
Dukakis scoffed at what he called the vice president's contention
that ``everything's fine, not to worry.''
   ``Ask yourself this: Could your children today buy the house
they grew up in?'' he asked. ``Can they pay for a college education
without a mountain of debt when they graduate? Is your family
really getting ahead _ or is it just running in place or even
falling behind?''
   The Massachusetts governor cited his support for universal
health insurance, a college aid program relying on payroll
deductions, job training, business investment incentives and
vigorous enforcement of the trade law.
   He also took a swipe at Bush's repeated allegations that Dukakis
is a big-spending liberal in hiding.
   ``The solutions we're proposing are not big-money solutions or
big-government solutions,'' Dukakis said. ``And unlike Mr. Bush's
tired old ideas, they won't leave America running in place. They'll
make America the most powerful and productive country on earth.''
   At the Alfred E. Durr Elementary School, Dukakis occasionally
spoke in Spanish as he urged pupils to careers in teaching or
science. He also took a few questions, which he rarely does with
reporters on the campaign trail.
   When Dukakis asked the youngsters to name some drugs, one
replied, ``Bush is a drug.'' Said Dukakis: ``Puts you to sleep,
right?''
   At a county incinerator in Dearborn Heights outside Detroit,
Dukakis spoke to about 200 students before heading inside to help
destroy an undetermined quantity of heroin and cocaine.
   He then told students he was heading into the incinerator to
destroy the drugs and said, ``I don't want to burn the hands that
are going to hold the nation, I hope.''

   A man who opted for shooting a drug informant in
the head and heart instead of injecting him with drain cleaner won
a stay of execution Monday night, the second time since the killer
was sentenced to death in 1976.
   Bobby Marion Francis, 44, had been scheduled to die at 7 a.m.
Tuesday in the electric chair at Florida State Prison near Starke.
But U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt granted a stay, ruling
inadequate time to consider the appeal.
   A Monroe County jury found Francis guilty of murder in the death
of Titus R. Walters. Walters was bound and gagged for nearly two
hours while Francis planned how to kill him, according to court
records. Francis apparently debated injecting Walters with the
household caustic used to clear clogged pipes.
   Nesbitt said the appeal was filed shortly after noon Monday,
fewer than 19 hours before Francis was set to die. She said there
was not enough time for her to study all the testimony in the
voluminous file.
   The stay remains in effect until further orders by the judge.
Francis' death warrant expires Oct. 10.
   Francis, who was sentenced to death in June 1976, survived his
first death warrant when the Florida Supreme Court granted him a
stay in November 1987.
   Nine death row inmates are now under active warrants. Gov. Bob
Martinez has signed 55 death warrants since taking office 21 months
ago. Since then, Willie Jasper Darden and Beauford White have been
electrocuted.

   George Bush gave a
thumbs-up welcome to the returning crew of the space shuttle
Discovery on Monday in a picture-perfect example of how the
Republican can use the vice presidency to advance his campaign for
the White House.
   ``Just great,'' Bush said after watching the shuttle landing
from a flag-draped observation stand. ``A great day for our
country,'' the campaigning vice president added, standing front and
center as the space program concluded its first mission since the
Challenger disaster more than two years ago.
   A few hours later, Bush told a campaign rally in Redding,
Calif., that he was committed to development of an operational
space station by 1996. In remarks prepared for the occasion but not
delivered, he declined to embrace a manned voyage to Mars, saying
he wasn't completely certain that planet should be the next
destination for Americans in space.
   Bush said he was committed to continued manned space exploration
subject to ``budgetary considerations.''
   Bush formally hailed the astronauts at a welcoming ceremony a
few hours earlier, saying he was proud to ``welcome the space
shuttle Discovery back to earth, back to America, and back to the
future.''
   In his prepared remarks, Bush thanked the astronauts, thanked
the support crews and recalled the ``seven departed friends, who
will never be forgotten, cheering you from above.'' That reference
to the victims of the Challenger disaster more than two years ago
was the only somber note of a campaign day scripted to accentuate
the positive.
   A few moments after the shuttle, landed Bush's limousine drove
across the dry lake bed landing area and deposited him a few feet
from where the craft stood. He walked over to a ramp and _ while
television cameras recorded the scene _ shook hands with the five
astronauts as they walked down the steps. Skipper Fred Hauck came
first, holding a large American flag.
   At one point, vice presidential chief of staff Craig Fuller
gently pulled NASA administrator James Fletcher into the background
so Bush would be alone in the pictures of the greeting.
   Earlier, the vice president paused long enough to field a few
questions from reporters.
   He said he had heard rumors that an American hostage was being
released in Lebanon but quickly added, ``There's no way of knowing
the facts.''
   He also said he had received a briefing on the shake-up in the
Soviet. ``We keep on keeping on,'' he said. ``We do what's best for
the United States and if these changes work for the benefit of the
free world, so be it.''
   In the meantime, aides to Bush and Democratic rival Michael
Dukakis said the second presidential debate would go on despite the
withdrawal of the League of Women Voters on Monday as sponsor.
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which
sponsored the first debate 10 days ago in Winston-Salem, N.C., said
it accepted the campaigns' invitation and was taking steps to hold
the debate Oct. 13 or 14 in Los Angeles, as planned.
   The vice president witnessed the shuttle landing as he set out
on a three-day campaign swing through the West and South. Bush
enjoys a lead in the public opinion polls as well as a seeming
advantage in the Electoral College as the campaign enters its final
five weeks.
   California, the largest state with 47 Electoral votes, is rated
as even, and Bush made the campaign appearance in Redding after
leaving the NASA complex.
   Bush's journey to the California desert wasn't the first time he
has used his office to further his campaign for the White House,
and Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis has staged any number of ceremonies
in his home state to draw attention to his record there.
   But the day's events had a higher profile that Bush's trip to
the United Nations last July or his swearing in of Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos last month.
   This time, his schedule placed him at an event that was
guaranteed massive news coverage and served to associate the vice
president with the happy news that America's long drought in its
manned space program is over.
   The entire scene was choreographed meticulously by Bush's aides
for maximum television advantage.
   He shook hands with each of the five, posed for ``thumbs up''
photograph with the heat-blackened shuttle as a backdrop and then
joined the crew for a walk around the orbiter to see how well it
withstood four days in space.
   He got the red carpet treatment all day.
   The vice president's Air Force jet was met by Fletcher and Chuck
Yeagar, a well-known former test pilot, as well as California Gov.
George Deukmejian.
   Bush watched the shuttle landing from an observation tower,
accompanied by his wife, Barbara, and other NASA officials, then
took a 10-minute tour of NASA's Mission Control Center before
driving out to the shuttle and greeting its five-member crew.
   The Bushes then were driven to a private lunch with the NASA
brass and families of the shuttle crew members.

   A woman who pleaded guilty to neglect
charges in the death of a 4-year-old son gave up her day-old baby
for adoption Monday and also would undergo sterilization under the
plea bargain, her attorney said.
   Melody S. Baldwin, 29, was close to agreeing to be sterilized
Tuesday morning, the latest she can undergo the procedure without
waiting another six weeks, attorney Michael J. Donahoe said.
   A judge has said the operation could reduce her sentence.
   ``We're going to get that ironed out tomorrow,'' Donahoe said
after the adoption papers were signed. ``I think everyone wants to
make sure they're doing the right thing and not leaving themselves
open to criticism.''
   For medical reasons, a woman can only be sterilized within 48
hours of giving birth before waiting six weeks for conditions to be
proper again, Donahoe said.
   Baldwin, who is awaiting sentencing for administering lethal
doses of mind-altering drugs to her son Joshua two years ago, gave
birth to an 8-pound, 5-ounce boy Sunday at Wishard Hospital, where
she is being detained.
   Both were reported in good condition Monday.
   Donahoe said rights to privacy prevented him from saying where
the child would go or who was present for the signing.
   Marion Superior Court Judge Roy F. Jones has offered to give Ms.
Baldwin a reduced sentence if she agrees to be sterilized.
   She could face up to 20 years imprisonment on the neglect
charge. The former waitress had been charged with murder for
administering lethal doses of a drug and interfering with the
child's medical treatments.
   Ms. Baldwin was placed under a court order when she attempted to
leave another Indianapolis hospital, where she was being treated
for possible self-induced weight loss while she was pregnant.
   Jones later approved an order transferring Ms. Baldwin to
Wishard from St. Francis Hospital, where the sterilization process
cannot be performed because of the hospital's affiliation with the
Catholic Church.
   Donahoe filed a motion Friday to release his client on bond,
pending sentencing. Jones was awaiting a psychiatric evaluation on
Ms. Baldwin before ruling on the motion.

   Attorney Melvin Belli's accountant did not
know about a transaction that led to a $3 million tax claim, an
Internal Revenue Service auditor testified Monday.
   Belli, 81, maintains that he does not owe back gift taxes and
penalties on an office building he transferred to his son, Caesar.
The IRS contends the sale of the building was a sham, in which no
money changed hands because the $9,000 a month his son was to have
paid was offset by Belli being charged the same amount in rent.
   Large gifts are taxed against the giver at a higher rate than
the capital gains tax on a real estate sale.
   U.S. Tax Court Judge Julian Jacobs said he wants the trial,
which resumed Monday, to conclude this week.
   IRS auditor David Stohlberg testified he met four times over 10
weeks in 1984 with Belli accountant John Jones before he received a
grant deed and promissory note documenting the building transfer.
   He said Jones told him Belli had been ``difficult'' and that he,
Jones, was considering not keeping Belli as a client. Stohlberg
said Jones told him that until the tax examination began, he was
unaware of the transaction.
   Although the deed showed it was signed in January 1981, it
wasn't recorded until September 1984, the auditor said. The
discrepancy ``raised all sorts of questions in my mind,'' he said.
   Belli has testified that he made out a deed for the building to
his son on Christmas in 1978, but didn't deliver it until 1981,
telling his son to work out the purchase price. He said he wanted
to keep the building in the family, but was advised by Jones that a
gift would be taxed prohibitively.
   He said that he asked Caesar several times during the next three
years to get the building appraised and to take care of the related
legal paperwork, but nothing happened until 1984.
   A deed to the building was recorded with the city in 1984,
listing the date of purchase as 1981 and the price at $1.4 million.
The IRS said the building was worth $2.4 million in 1981 and $4.2
million in 1984.
   The IRS wants gift taxes and fraud penalties from Belli for
either $1.2 million, $1.4 million or $3 million, depending on
whether the transfer took place in 1978, 1981 or 1984.
   In a related case, the IRS is seeking more than $300,000 in back
taxes and penalties from Belli and his estranged wife, Lia, who has
filed for divorce.
   Belli sat in the front row of the courtroom with his son,
Caesar, Monday. During a break he peeked at an artist's sketch and
when he was asked how he looked, Belli replied, ``Tired.''

   Four people have been charged with murder in
the 5-year-old slaying of New York producer Roy Radin, who
authorities say was embroiled in a soured deal to finance the movie
``The Cotton Club.''
   Radin disappeared May 13, 1983, on his way to a meeting
concerning the film, and his body was found a month later with a
bullet wound in the head. His death, authorities said Monday, was a
contract killing.
   A key figure in negotiations over the film was Hollywood
producer Robert Evans, said Deputy District Attorney David Conn,
and ``I'm sure his testimony is going to become important at some
point.''
   ``We're not making any allegations against him at this time,''
Conn said. Asked if Evans, producer of such movies as ``Chinatown''
and ``Marathon Man,'' remains under investigation, Conn answered,
``Yes.''
   Charged with Radin's murder were Karen De Layne Greenberger,
formerly known as Elaine Jacobs; William Molony Mentzer; Alex
Lamota Marti; and Robert Ulmer Lowe. The complaint alleged that
they killed Radin ``for financial gain.''
   In addition, the complaint charged Mentzer, Lowe and a fifth
defendant, Robert Leroy Deremer with murdering June Mincher, a
prostitute. Conn said the two killings were unrelated except that
two of the defendants were involved.
   Conn said the Radin slaying resulted from a dispute between
Radin and Greenberger about a plan to raise $35 million from
investors in the Puerto Rican government for Evans' production of
``The Cotton Club.''
   The prosecutor said Radin was introduced to Evans by
Greenberger, and Radin became a middleman in the Puerto Rican
negotiations.
   But a dispute developed between Radin and Greenberger over a
finder's fee she was demanding, Conn said.
   ``We think the individuals felt the deal could go forward
without Radin being involved,'' Conn said, ``and it did go forward,
but without the Puerto Rican investors.''
   On May 13, 1983, he said Radin stepped into a limousine rented
by Greenberger ``with the intention of going to a restaurant and
discussing the business arrangement further.
   ``He never arrived at the restaurant and his body was found June
10, 1983, in the northwest corner of (Los Angeles) County in
Gorman,'' Conn said. ``He'd been shot in the back of the head.''
   Asked why it had taken so long to bring charges, Conn said: ``We
have new evidence that's been uncovered in the course of the
investigation by the sheriff's department.''
   Conn said the complaint was issued Sept. 22 but kept sealed
because of fear for the safety of an informant who has since been
relocated.
   Search warrants executed Sunday and turned up weapons and
explosives at the homes of Mentzer and Marti and at a storage
locker, he said..
   Conn said Mentzer was a private investigator involved in
security work with Marti, Deremer and Lowe.
   The complaint alleged special circumstances which could result
in the death penalty if the defendants are convicted.
   Greenberger was arrested in Florida, Conn said. Lowe was
arrested in Maryland, where Deremer was due to be arrested, he
said. Mentzer and Marti were arrested in Los Angeles.
   In 1980, actress-model Melonie Haller claimed Radin drugged and
raped her at gunpoint during one of the frequent parties at his
mansion on Long Island, east of Manhattan.
   The actress, who appeared in ``Welcome Back, Kotter,'' was found
dazed and bleeding on a Long Island Rail Road train. Radin who
pleaded innocent to the rape charges but guilty to possessing a
handgun, was fined $1,000 and placed on probation.

<HEAD>Costa Rica Assails Nicaragua For `Repression' of Democratic Rights</HEAD>

   The Costa Rican foreign minister said
Monday that no Central American nation fulfilled its duties under a
regional peace plan, but singled out Nicaragua in particular for
stepping up ``its repression.''
   ``The progress in this peaceful effort has stopped,'' said
Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto. President Oscar Arias
Sanchez of Costa Rica won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting
the plan.
   The minister, speaking in Spanish, told the 43rd General
Assembly that ``to a greater or lesser degree, none of the states
that signed the procedure (peace plan) has complied fully with the
letter of the agreement.''
   Costa Rica has not yet ratified the treaty establishing the
Central American Parliament envisaged in the plan, Madrigal Nieto
noted.
   The presidents of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and
El Salvador signed a peace plan Aug. 7, 1987, which has as its main
goals: cease-fires in insurgencies taking place in Nicaragua,
Guatamala and El Salvador; amnesty decrees; democratization
measures; lifting of emergency or martial laws; an end to outside
military adventurism in the region, and an end to using any
country's territory by groups or individuals seeking the overthrow
of a neighboring government.
   ``Unfortunately, we have to say that, over the months, we have
seen the Nicaraguan government step up its repression, move away
from fulfilling its commitments and attempt to reduce the crisis to
a problem of security, showing obvious contempt for democratic
values,'' Madrigal Nieto said.
   ``The most alarming thing, however, is that this situation has
serious repercussions for Nicaragua's neighbors, who have to take
in the thousands of people who flee in search of freedom, food and
shelter.''
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has been fighting
U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras since 1981.
   Madrigal Nieto told reporters later, speaking in English, ``The
firm commitment to democracy has not been made by some countries,
and that is the main problem.
   ``I mentioned Nicaragua clearly in my speech because I do not
think they have the political will to carry it (the peace process)
on. I think they could introduce a lot of changes, and they should
assume some other attitudes, more positive ones, to see real
progress.
   ``We think they should not send 40 political leaders to jail, as
they have had 40 people for more than 80 days without due process.
That does not contribute to our efforts to find this (diplomatic)
solution above any decision of the United States'' to fund a
military solution through the Contra rebels, he said.
   Madrigal Nieto said such democratic reforms would save Nicaragua
from later counter-revolution by rightists radicalized by
repression by the Sandinistas.

   The shuttle Discovery
returned to a star-spangled welcome from more than 400,000 people
Monday after a post-Challenger shakedown mission that NASA called
``an absolutely stunning success.''
   ``Discovery, welcome back,'' Mission Control told commander
Frederick H. Hauck as he guided the ship to a picture-perfect
landing after a four-day, 1.6-million mile mission. ``A great
ending to the new beginning'' of the manned space program.
   The national anthem was playing as the white ship, with its
stubby Delta-shaped wings, leveled out and rolled to a smooth stop
on the center line painted on the hard-packed sand of this desert
air base. It was precisely on time, at 9:37 a.m. PDT.
   They were met by their wives here and flew home with them later
in the day to their training base in Houston, to an enthusiastic
reception by about 4,000 Johnson Space Center area residents, city
officials and fellow astronauts.
   The Discovery crew arrived at Ellington Field in Houston in a
carnival atmosphere complete with flags, marching bands and bright
television lights.
   The astronauts and their wives stepped off the aircraft onto a
red carpet and walked between an honor guard of flag-carrying
Rangerettes from Friendswood High School.
   Earlier, the crowd at Edwards cheered and waved small American
flags for the successful completion of a mission that ended a
32-month period in which no manned ship bearing the American flag
went into space.
   Vice President George Bush, on hand for the touchdown, thanked
the astronauts at a ceremony later in the day ``for putting America
back in space.'' He said they had shown that ``the shuttle is a
strong bird and it could and should fly again.''
   And, referring to the seven who died when the Challenger
exploded, Bush told the Discovery crew: ``I can't help but think
that just as you had millions cheering for you from below, you had
seven departed friends who will never be forgotten, cheering for
you from above.''
   Mission Specialist David C. Hilmers sounded a common theme for
his fellow Discovery crewmen when he said:
   ``I want you to remember what this flight meant to America. I
want you to remember what America can do when it pulls together and
has a goal. I want you to remember that no matter how hard a
setback we've had, we can bounce back from adversity and I want you
to remember that we can continue to dream for the future and space
should be part of those dreams.''
   Earlier NASA administrator James C. Fletcher called the safe
return of Discovery ``a banner day for all of us,'' while shuttle
chief Richard Truly called the flight ``an absolutely stunning
success.''
   But Truly balked at a question that implied that with the new
success, the trauma of the Challenger explosion had been overcome.
   ``Even when we've flown a few flights, we are not going to
forget the Challenger accident,'' he said. ``For the people who
work in the program, that's going to be on their minds for a long
time.''
   Truly, a former astronaut, said from cursory inspection the ship
appeared to have suffered little damage from the rigors of
launching and returning through the atmosphere: a few tiles
suffered thumb-sized nicks, he said.
   ``We saw no problems I'm aware of in any system,'' said Arnold
Aldrich, who is director of the shuttle program.
   For 55 minutes after landing, the crew was occupied with
flipping switches and turning off systems while ground crews moved
up giant vehicles to ``safe'' the vehicle and to remove any
residual toxic gases.
   The flight was NASA's first since the Challenger mission ended
tragically 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. It was the
26th flight in the shuttle series.
   When the crew emerged, Hauck was waving an oversized American
flag and the step railing was festooned with six small flags. Bush
waited at the foot of the stairs and welcomed the astronauts
one-by-one, pilot Richard O. Covey, and mission specialists
Hilmers, John M. Lounge, George D. Nelson.
   The astronauts then led the Republican presidential candidate
around the nose of their ship as they performed the traditional
pilot's walk-around.
   Bush's Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, interrupted a
speech in Hartford, Conn., to let the crowd know the shuttle had
landed safely. ``America is back in space,'' he said. ``We are
proud, and we are thrilled at its achievements and the courage of
that crew.''
   Fletcher was asked if the vice president's presence was
politicizing the event.
   ``It is not a political visit by the vice president,'' said
Fletcher, who was appointed by President Reagan. ``He told me he
didn't want to talk about politics today ... As far as Governor
Dukakis is concerned, he was not invited; he did not ask to come.''
   The Air Force said 109,000 vehicles carried an estimated 410,000
people to the public viewing site and that at least 15,000 more
watched from a VIP section. The largest crowd for a shuttle landing
was a half-million on July 4, 1982, when President and Mrs. Reagan
greeted Columbia.
   ``It's a beautiful day down there and lots of folks waiting to
see you land,'' Mission Control told the astronauts as they
prepared their return.
   The main objectives of the mission had been met last Thursday,
first with a safe and successful launch, then with deployment of a
giant $100 million communications satellite. Afterwards, the
workload for Hauck and his crew was a relatively light one; NASA
had scheduled lots of trouble-shooting time to reflect the fact
that more than 400 changes had been made to the shuttle after the
Challenger accident.
   It appeared that the shuttle had passed its tests brilliantly
and Hauck commented he had never seen a ship so trouble-free.
``Good systems, good performance,'' was the word from Mission
Control.
   The rocket boosters, blamed for the Challenger explosion and its
loss of seven lives, performed apparently flawlessly on liftoff
last Thursday. Although the 149-foot-long rockets were recovered
immediately from the Atlantic, their segments had not yet been
taken apart for inspection.
   Hauck and pilot Covey guided the 97-ton, $1.5 billion spaceship
to a perfect landing. They had fired their braking rockets an hour
before touchdown to start the free-falling glide halfway around the
world from 188 miles high.
   The flight had a few minor problems. A cooling system that had
given trouble for most of the mission and had the astronauts
sometimes uncomfortably warm also failed momentarily during
Discovery's plunge to Earth.
   On touchdown, Hauck tested new brake and steering systems
designed to improve performance so that shuttles in the future can
return to landing at the launch site in Florida. That evaluation,
too, awaited analysis.
   Moments after the landing, Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., rose on the
House floor to proclaim that ``we are back'' in the nation's space
program.
   ``It has been a psychological lifting of a burden we have been
carrying for almost three years,'' said Nelson, who is chairman of
the House Science space subcommittee and was aboard the last
successful shuttle trip, the one before the Challenger accident.
   ``We are back, and we now we're going on to extraordinary
accomplishments in America's space program,'' he said. ``Americans
have reclaimed the high ground.''

   Two gunmen on a motorcycle drove up to a

   One other man in the car was wounded and taken to a hospital for

Francesco Sapuppo, 35, suspected of being a member of a Mafia clan
based in Catania, eastern Sicily's largest city with 375,00

   ANSA said police speculated the intended target was Sapuppo.
   The dead man, shot in the chest and head by pistol fire, was

<TEXT>
   Nearly 5,000 well-wishers, waving Texas and
American flags, turned out at a Houston airport Monday night to
welcome home the five Discovery astronauts after their mission that
carried Americans back into space.
   ``We were privileged to go around the earth about 64 times since
we left you,'' Commander Rick Hauck said at ceremonies at Houston's
Ellington Field.
   ``We saw some beautiful sights and we've lived in a wonderful
machine and it was wonderful to come back to Edwards Air Force Base
(Calif.). But it's even more wonderful to come back home,'' he said.
   The astronauts strolled from their NASA jets, which carried them
and their wives on a three-hour flight from Edwards, where they
landed Discovery safely earlier in the day.
   They walked along a red carpet and through a tunnel of American
flags, some of them pausing to hug their children. Then they
climbed a stairway to a blue drape-clad stage backed by a large
red, white and blue sign which proclaimed: ``NASA & Houston, Back
On Top To Stay.''
   ``We just got back from the greatest adventure of our lives and
it was a whole lot of fun,'' Mission Specialist Dave Hilmers said.
``But you shared this adventure as much as we did and you're just
as much the heroes as we are.
   ``Back in the dark days after the Challenger accident, folks in
Houston never lost faith in NASA and folks at NASA never lost faith
in Houston. Let's go back to work tomorrow and make this adventure
happen again and again and again.''
   The welcome home was a far cry from the return to Houston
shuttle astronauts had become accustomed to. In flights before the
Challenger accident, the return had become so routine that only a
handful of family members and friends were on hand to greet them.
   Monday's event, however, was intended to show the support of the
Houston-area communities for the space program, organizers said.
``We want to welcome you back as neighbors,'' Houston Mayor Kathy
Whitmire said.
   ``We had a special ceremony out at Edwards and that was kind of
welcome home for the country and it was very special,'' Mission
Specialist Pinky Nelson said. ``But this is more special because
we're coming home to our friends and coworkers and the people who
made it happen.''
   A high school band and flag-waving troupe entertained the crowd
in the hours before the astronauts arrived at the same field where
a week ago they left for Florida and the launch of Discovery.
   ``This is much like the first flight's return,'' said Gerry
Griffin, former director of the Johnson Space Center and now
president of the Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce, one of the
organizers of Monday airport event.
   Tommy and Molly Lowe, of Houston, brought their two small
children to the airfield and waited nearly four hours for the
astronauts. ``It's worth it,'' Mrs. Lowe said.
   Lowe said his daughter, Megan, was born 2{ years ago and arrived
home from the hospital the day the Challenger exploded. ``You feel
like it was part of you on the shuttle,'' he said.
   ``We've watched it from the start to finish,'' Mrs. Lowe said of
Discovery's mission. ``We were on pins and needles. But this is
just a part of American pride.''

<HEAD>30 More Mediterranean Fruit Flies Found, Major Infestation Feared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty Mediterranean fruit flies were
found in Los Angeles County traps, triggering a major effort to
kill the pests before they destroy crops, authorities said.
   The Medfly, a severe threat to California's multibillion-dollar
agricultural industry, is considered one of the most destructive
crop-damaging pests because it preys on more than 250 varieties of
produce, reproduces rapidly and survives in different climates,
officials said.
   The state's most serious infestation cost $97.6 million in
eradication efforts that continued from 1980 to 1982.
   The flies, both male and female, were discovered over the
weekend, said William Edwards, chief deputy to the county
agriculture commissioner.
   More than 1,300 detection traps were set after a male fruit fly
was discovered in a trap last week.
   ``This one has the potential to be really bad,'' Edwards said.
``Thirty-one flies is a significant number to start out with.''
   Edwards said aerial applications of the pesticide malathion are
tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
   Also planned is the release of up to 40 million sterile
Mediterranean fruit flies per week over a couple months in an
effort to eradicate the crop-destroying pests, he said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday
refused to lift a federal appeals court order blocking the
execution of a convicted murderer who wanted all appeals dropped.
   Gerald Smith, who was scheduled to be the first inmate put to
death by Missouri since 1965, had asked that no appeals be made to
delay his execution by lethal injection, scheduled for 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday.
   Smith was sentenced for the 1980 bludgeoning death of a former
girlfriend in St. Louis.
   The Supreme Court upheld the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which voted 8-2 late Monday to block Smith's execution, rejecting
the state's efforts to lift a stay issued earlier in the day by a
three-judge panel of the court.
   State Attorney General William Webster's office filed a petition
with the nation's highest court late Monday asking that the stay be
lifted, said spokesman John Baker.
   Smith telephoned The Associated Press to complain about the
stay. He said lawyers and judges were needlessly questioning his
competency and putting him and his wife through more turmoil by
delaying the execution.
   ``It's not me they're concerned about. They just don't believe
in the death penalty,'' Smith said. ``They may end up being sorry.
I won't elaborate on that. Whatever happens from here on out would
be their responsibility.''
   ``I was ready to go,'' Smith said. ``I was ready to meet my
maker and I was at peace with myself. I'm not sure I will be at
peace with myself when my time comes again.''
   The three-judge panel issued a stay in response to a petition by
the Missouri Public Defender Commission claiming Smith may not be
competent to decide on making appeals.
   The execution was scheduled to be carried out at one minute
after midnight so that if it was blocked, prosecutors would have
more than 23 hours under the Tuesday death warrant to try to have
the stay lifted.
   Authorities at the Missouri State Penitentiary proceeded Monday
as though the execution would take place, said spokesman Dale Riley.
   In their order staying the execution, the three judges said more
time was needed to review an affidavit from a psychiatrist
questioning whether Smith was competent to make decisions on his
fate.
   In an interview Friday at the prison, Smith said he considers
all further appeals hopeless and criticized outside efforts to stop
the execution.
   Asked how he would react if a court stepped in and blocked it,
Smith said: ``They can only block it for so long. Everything's been
resolved. They're going over the same things because they have
nothing else to go over.''
   Smith complained Friday about the Public Defender appeal, saying
it inaccurately said his wife had influenced him to drop appeals.
Smith, ruled competent by a federal judge two years ago, said he
had made the decision before he met his wife, whom he married in
prison last year.
   Smith was convicted of using an eight-pound iron bar to beat to
death Karen Roberts, a woman he said had given him a venereal
disease and caused him to lose his fiancee. He was given a second
death penalty for his part in the 1985 stabbing murder of fellow
death row inmate Robert Baker.
   The state's emergency motion filed in response to the stay noted
that last week, a different three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit
had refused to block the execution.
   ``The panel should not allow such a collateral attack upon their
opinion,'' the state's motion said.
   Gov. John Ashcroft issued a statement saying that a review of
Smith's record by the state Board of Probation and Parole provided
no new information that would prompt him to step in and block the
execution.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter asked
Monday that an international peace conference be held on the Middle
East and cautioned that the superpowers' ``uncontrollable'' allies
there could spark nuclear conflict.
   ``Without peace in the Middle East there cannot be peace in the
world,'' Carter told 900 people in a speech at the Oxford Union,
Oxford University's student-run debating society.
   Carter, 64, called for peace talks supervised by the U.N.
Security Council to resolve disputes in the Middle East and said
wealthy nations should donate $15 billion to fund any agreements
stemming from the proposed forum.
   ``The Palestinians must publicly accept Israel as a nation with
a permanent existence and must renounce violence,'' said Carter,
who also urged Israel to respect ``basic human rights'' and
self-determination for the Plestinians.
   During his presidency, the Georgia Democrat was architect of the
1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt.
   Carter said the Middle East remained the most likely flashpoint
for a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet Union and the United States have allies and friends
in that region who are unpredictable and uncontrollable,'' he said.
``There is no way to have an easy ... solution to the problems of
the Middle East, but the overwhelming majority of people there want
peace and justice.''
   He condemned Israel for using plastic bullets in the 10-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Israeli authories say the bullets, which reportedly killed several
protesters, are designed to cause injuries.
   The former president's appearance at Oxford followed his recent
tour of the Middle East.

<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on Monday
dismissed an appeal by an anti-abortion group seeking to put a
question on the state's November ballot about whether human life
begins at conception.
   The justices of the state's highest court issued the dismissal
without explanation, saying they wanted to make the decision known
by the ballot's printing deadline but needed more time to write
their ``opinion or opinions.''
   ``Until we find out (the court's reasons), I don't know what to
say except that I am greatly disappointed,'' said John Rankin, head
of the New England Christian Action Council, which sponsored the
ballot question.
   Susan Newsom, spokeswoman of the Planned Parenthood League of
Massachusetts, said the court had made a good ruling.
   ``I am not surpised at all at that decision. (The referendum)
did not fit the criteria at all for a public policy question.''
   The question would have asked voters to define, in biological
terms, when life begins. It gave three possible answers _
``conception, viability or birth'' and a write-in option where
voters could ``specify a different biological term.''
   State Attorney General James Shannon had ruled the non-biding
referendum improper, saying it failed to give a clear directive to
lawmakers and was ambiguous.
   Rankin said the question's objective was to develop a consensus
on when human life begins to redress what he considers a failing to
answer the question in the landmark Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court
decision allowing abortions.
   Although Rankin's group was unable to get the question on the
1988 Massachusetts ballot, Rankin found success in being able to
collect nearly 26,000 signatures for his ballot petition.
   ``I think what we have done so far is redefined the debate'' on
the issue from one typically limited to government funding for
abortions to a broader question, he said.

   The Supreme Court on Monday night refused to
let Missouri officials execute a convicted killer who was scheduled
to be the state's first death row inmate put to death in 23 years.
   The Justices, without dissent, rejected an emergency request
aimed at setting aside a lower court's postponement of Gerald
Smith's execution, which had been scheduled for early Tuesday.
   Smith, who had asked that there be no appeals made to delay his
execution, was convicted of the 1980 bludgeoning death of Karen
Roberts, a woman he said had given him a venereal disease and
caused him to lose his fiancee. He was given a second death penalty
for his part in the 1985 stabbing murder of fellow death row inmate
Robert Baker.
   He was to have been killed by lethal injection. The high court's
action means Smith will not be executed pending further review of
his case.
   No convicted murder has been executed in Missouri since 1965,
when Lloyd Leo Anderson was sent to the gas chamber for murdering a
teen-age delivery boy during a drugstore robbery.

   An Executive Council member whose own vote could
have given him a tie in his re-election primary, learned Monday
that a missing absentee ballot has turned up.
   Herbert Connolly, who has served in the obscure state office
since 1969, failed in a court bid to halt the printing of ballots
for the November election, which went to the printer Monday bearing
his rival's name.
   But Connolly won an expedited hearing in Superior Court after he
learned that a still-sealed absentee ballot was found in Brookline
town hall.
   Connolly said he was late getting to the polls on Sept. 15 and
failed to cast a vote for himself in the Democratic primary.
   So it was his own fault when a recount showed that Connolly had
lost the Democratic nomination for a seat on the Executive Council
by just one vote.
   The recount showed Connolly with 14,715 votes. His opponent,
Lowell City Councilor Robert B. Kennedy, got 14,716.
   The 67-year-old car dealer said he had been campaigning in the
neighboring city of Waltham on election day, ``and I waited until
the last minute to race over'' to vote.
   The eight-member Governor's Council, which dates from the
Colonial era, lost many of its powers in the 1960s. Its chief
remaining duties are to approve criminal pardons and confirm judges
nominated by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   In any event, failing to vote was not Connolly's only blunder.
Shortly before the primary, he placed a newspaper advertisement
urging his supporters to get to the polls on Sept. 14. The election
was Sept. 15.
   Connolly's lawyer, state Rep. William Galvin, former House
chairman of the Legislature's committee on Election Laws, said the
lost ballot could be blank.
   If it is opened and allowed and shows a vote for Kennedy, giving
him a two-vote margin, Galvin said he would still contest the
outcome.
   If the mystery ballot was cast for Connolly, Galvin said the
resulting tie would have to be broken by a vote of the ward and
town Democratic committees in Connolly's district.
   ``This is really a very interesting situation,'' observed Deputy
Secretary of State Martin Meehan.

   Farmers can start lining up today at
Agriculture Department offices to apply for federal drought aid
under a $3.9 billion disaster program passed by Congress two months
ago.
   The measure, signed by President Reagan on Aug. 11, authorizes
assistance for livestock, grain and other agricultural producers.
It is administered by the department's Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, or ASCS, which has county offices
nationwide.
   Drought and hot weather devastated this year's grain crops in
much of the country, reducing total grain output by an estimated 31
percent from 1987 harvests, according to USDA estimates.

   Congress also may approve legislation to apply the first-ever

   George Bush commands an early autumn advantage
over Michael Dukakis in the Electoral College, but the campaign for
the White House will be decided in a series of close, hard fought
contests from California to Connecticut, according to an Associated
Press survey of the 50 states.
   Republicans sound confident following a strong, late summer
surge by Bush. Democrats project concern but say there's ample time
to overtake the vice president.
   Bush appears to be solidifying much of the traditional
Republican base across the South and Rocky Mountain West, the
survey showed. He is rated the solid leader in Florida with its 21
electoral votes and seems to be opening a little daylight between
himself and the Democrats in Texas, although Dukakis is waging an
intensive campaign in running mate Lloyd Bentsen's home state.
   Border states such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee
remain competitive.
   Dukakis is given the edge in several traditional Democratic
party strongholds, including New York with its 36 electoral votes,
but has not been as successful as Bush in cementing his own
political base.

   Americans overwhelmingly believe the federal
government is rife with corruption, with seven in 10 saying they
think illegal payoffs are common, a Media General-Associated Press
poll has found.
   On specific cases, a plurality in the national poll said former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III should have been charged with
crimes, and half opposed a presidential pardon for the highest
official charged in the Iran-Contra case, former National Security
Adviser John M. Poindexter.
   Respondents were evenly split on a pardon for Poindexter's
assistant, former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   More fundamentally, the poll of 1,125 adults found deep
skepticism of the federal government's integrity. Just 40 percent
thought of the government as honest overall, while 50 percent said
not. The rest didn't know.
   The poll had a three-point margin of error.

Pinochet's presidency to 1997.
   Police and some army troops were out in force.
   By law political campaigning ended on midnight Sunday, after a
massive pro-Pinochet caravan of cars, trucks and buses jammed the
capital's main boulevards and groups of opposition sympathizers
skirmished with riot police.
   Dozens were arrested in the skirmishes, according to preliminary
police reports. Helmeted riot officers used tear gas, water cannons

   Now that Discovery has put the
nation back in space, sister ship Atlantis is set to follow in just
seven weeks and NASA plans seven more flights in 1989 on a mixture
of satellite delivery, secret military and dazzling planetary
missions.
   It's an ambitious schedule, considering that 32 months separated
the Challenger explosion and Discovery's journey that ended in
triumph Monday.
   But NASA officials who drew up the new manifest in August are
confident it can be done. In fact, they had planned two more
flights for 1989 but had to delete them because of a fuel plant
explosion in May that limits the supply of a component for the
shuttle's booster rockets.

   The Supreme Court, beginning a new term
Monday, set the stage for an important church-state ruling in a
Pittsburgh dispute over religious displays and expanded its study
of drug testing in the workplace.
   The justices issued orders in some 1,000 cases as they returned
to the bench after a three-month summer recess. They agreed to
grant full review in 20 of them.
   Most significantly, the court said it will decide whether
displays of a Christmas nativity scene and a menorah, symbolizing
the Jewish holiday of Chanukah, should be allowed at two government
buildings in Pittsburgh.

   The League of Women Voters dropped its
sponsorship of the second presidential debate Monday in a protest
over its lack of control, and the two campaigns quickly agreed to
replace it with a bipartisan commission.
   Spokesmen for both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush said the debate would go on, probably on Oct. 13 or 14
as scheduled, with the substitute sponsor.
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which
sponsored the first debate 10 days ago in Winston-Salem, N.C., said
it accepted the campaigns' invitation and was taking steps to hold
the debate in Los Angeles, as planned.

the Kremlin capped the biggest leadership shake-up in Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's 3{ years in power.
   The major beneficiary of the realignment of power was Gorbachev
himself. The Communist Party's general secretary was elected Soviet

Andrei A. Gromyko, 79, who retired.
   At a Monday meeting, the legislature of the Russian republic,

   Opposition leaders and Roman Catholic
church officials said Monday they fear violence by pro-government
provocateurs during this week's referendum on the presidency of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   A written declaration by the 16-party opposition coalition said
it had evidence that Pinochet supporters plan ``blackouts and
clashes with the people to interfere in the delivery of results''
of the Wednesday referendum.
   ``We call on people to vote early and to remain in their homes,
to reject provocations and violence, the only recourse available to
the regime to create a situation of chaos that impedes the normal
voting process,'' it said.

   Americans believe bribe-taking is rampant in the
federal government, a Media General-Associated Press poll has found.
   The national survey of 1,125 adults found deep skepticism of
government integrity. In the most critical finding, an overwhelming
70 percent said they thought taking illegal payoffs for special
favors was widespread.
   Fully half the respondents called the government dishonest
overall and seven in 10 called it poorly managed. Even more, 82

   The financial health of the nation's hospitals is
taking a turn for the worse, which could lead to more hospital
closings and a decline in the quality of patient care, an industry
group said Monday.
   The main cause of the hospitals' financial woes is
less-than-adequate payments under government Medicare and Medicaid
programs, said the Healthcare Financial Management Association,
citing a survey of 1,400 hospitals. There are about 7,000 hospitals
in the country.
   ``The first thing we need is to have a payment policy for
Medicaid and Medicare services that is rational,'' said association
President Richard L. Clarke. ``We feel that it is currently unfair
to hospitals.''

   Oil prices continued their dramatic march
downward Monday, flirting with the $13-a-barrel level in a stiff
test of lows not seen in two years.
   The November contract of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude which plunged 55 cents a barrel Friday, skidded another
31 cents to settle at $13.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Crude prices haven't closed this low since August 1986.
   The price of crude has skidded $2 a barrel over the past five
weeks. But experts say consumers probably won't see declines in
prices of gasoline and heating oil unless crude holds at these
depressed levels for an extended period.

<HEAD>Greene Takes Comedy Timeout From `L.A. Law' Role</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michele Greene, who plays a mousy junior
attorney on NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' gets the last laugh in her first
starring role in a television movie.
   Greene, in an about-face from Abby Perkins, is a bride who finds
the path to the altar a mixture of thorns and titters in NBC's
comedy movie ``Going To the Chapel,'' airing Sunday
   ``The fact that she's so different from Abby was a big
consideration for me,'' Greene said. ``Abby is very straight,
someone who does everything the right way. Abby gets all the
heart-wrenchers. She's inhibited, not expressive, emotionally
reserved.
   ``In the movie, I'm a girl from a crazy Italian family. A very
demonstrative family. They yell, they cry. My character is kind of
nuts. We meet her when she's under stress, and everything goes
wrong. I like to play a character like that. Abby would avoid a
confrontation. This character will call someone at 6 in the morning
and say, `We have to talk about this.'''
   The two-hour movie has a cast that looks like a who's-who of
sitcoms. The groom is Scott Valentine of ``Family Ties.'' The best
man is Mark Linn-Baker of ``Perfect Strangers.'' Others include
Barbara Billingsley (``Leave It to Beaver''), Eileen Brennan
(``Private Benjamin''), Joel Brooks (``My Sister Sam''), John
Ratzenberger (``Cheers''), Cloris Leachman (``Phyllis''), Max
Wright (``ALF'') and Dick Van Patten (``Eight Is Enough'').
   Greene will also be seen in another NBC movie, ``Double
Standards,'' which will be aired Oct. 17. That movie, based on a
true story, tells of a bigamous judge who had two wives and
families. Greene plays one wife, Robert Foxworth is the judge and
Pamela Bellwood is the other wife.
   The script for ``Going to the Chapel,'' originally titled
``Wedding Bell Blues,'' was sent to Greene to see if she was
interested.
   ``It was nice,'' she said. ``I didn't have to do anything. They
made me an offer. I laughed when I read the script. Halfway through
it I called my agent and said I wanted to do it.''
   The movie's wedding brings together two families who take an
instant dislike to each other. Greene's boisterous brood and
Valentine's snobs and social climbers all try to sabotage the
wedding.
   ``It's a comedy,'' she said, ``but what made me call my agent
were the dramatic scenes of the bride and groom trying to work out
their differences. Too many people think marriage is an arrival.
It's really the beginning of the trip.''
   Greene spent quite a bit of time in her wedding dress for
``Going to the Chapel.''
   ``The first time I put it on it was so pretty, so beautiful,''
she said. ``By the third day when they'd bring it in, I'd say, `I'm
not putting that thing on until the last minute.' We did the
picture in July and it was so hot. The dress came up to my neck.
When I took it off I had a red ring around my neck. I'd have to eat
lunch in it. And once I put the veil on I couldn't take it off.''
   The role of Abby Perkins in ``L.A. Law'' was written for Greene
by Steven Bochco, the executive producer and co-creator of the
Emmy-winning series. She had previously worked with Bochco on the
short-lived series about a minor-league baseball team, ``Bay City
Blues.'' She played the wife of a ballplayer, played by Perry Lang,
who went on to do the baseball movie ``Eight Men Out.''
   ``I guess stories about the minor leagues work in movies, but I
don't think it plays well in a series,'' she said.
   Greene was just out of the University of Southern California
when she did ``Bay City Blues'' in 1983.
   ``When I auditioned for that role, I felt I had a 50-50 chance
of getting it,'' she said. ``I really focused on that role, I
wanted it so badly. The day I read for it my dog got lost, and it
really shook me up. (The Rottweiler mix, named Inda, was found
shortly afterwards.) When I got it, I felt like I really owned that
role.''
   She said Abby has changed in the two years that ``L.A. Law'' has
been on the air.
   ``Abby loosens up a little each year,'' she said. ``There's a
major change in store for her this coming season. Let's say that I
don't have to wear business suits any more.''

<HEAD>Thousands of POWs Stranded by Stalled Iran-Iraq Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks have
left tens of thousands of prisoners of the Iran-Iraq war
languishing in camps, waiting for freedom that may be months, even
years, away.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran, who heads his
country's delegation at the talks, said in a recent Tehran radio
interview monitored in Nicosia: ``We're trying to get an exchange
of POWs arranged as quickly as possible.''
   But United Nations officials said the issue has still had not
been discussed at the month-old peace talks when they went into
their stall.
   When a prisoner exchange does come off, however, it will be the
biggest organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross
since the Geneva Convention of 1949.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 by Iraq. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Baghdad and
Tehran believe Iran holds 60,000 to 70,000 prisoners and Iraq
30,000 to 50,000.
   The POWs include hundreds of Iranian boy soldiers, many of whom
have been held since the early days of the 8-year-old war and have
grown up in captivity.
   The Soviet Union held thousands of Germans after World War II.
The last 9,000 were only released in 1955 after the Soviets and
West Germans agreed to establishing diplomatic relations.
   Iran has freed a handful of disabled Iraqis since a cease-fire
took effect Aug. 20.
   But Iraq has freed none and has even added to its tally by
seizing more than 700 Iranians in September in what Tehran claims
was a major cease-fire violation.
   U.N. observers have confirmed the Iranians were captured, but so
far have not been able to secure their release.
   Iraq's information minister, Latif Nayef Jassim, said his
countrymen ``are opening their arms wide to welcome home'' the POWs
held by Iran.
   But some diplomats fear that both sides will try to use the
prisoners as bargaining chips in the peace talks that bogged down,
almost as soon as they began, over sovereignty of the Shatt Al-Arab
waterway and troop withdrawals.
   The POWs appear to have become pawns in the propaganda war
between Iran and Iraq that has swelled since the peace talks began
Aug. 25 in Geneva.
   Iraq, stung by international condemnation for its alleged use of
outlawed chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels, has intensified
accusations that the Iranians have tortured, killed and brainwashed
Iraqi POWs. Iran has made similar charges.
   Jassim recently accused the Iranians of ``inhuman practices .. .
starting with mass executions and ending with psychological
torture.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying in a
statement: ``The savagery of Iran's rulers and their mad practices
against Iraqi POWs has caused the death of a large number of them.''
   Thirty disabled Iraqi POWs released by Iran in early September
recently told a Baghdad news conference that their Iranian guards
systematically torture prisoners and pressure them to switch
allegiances. Like most Iranians, many Iraqis are Shiite Moslems.
   Christians among the Iraqi POWs were singled out and subjected
to extreme maltreatment and pressure to convert to Islam by their
Shiite guards, the ex-POWs said.
   ``When I told them I was a Christian, they asked me to convert
to Islam before they would give me any medical help,'' said Wa'd
Aziz Na'mou, who told reporters he was captured in January 1987,
after he was wounded in the eyes during an Iranian offensive.
   ``I refused and they left me without treatment. I lost both
eyes. Many of the Christian soldiers were forced to convert to
Islam under psychological pressure and torture.''
   The prisoner's account could not be independently confirmed with
other sources or raised with Iranian officials because of limited
access Western news organizations have with Tehran.
   A prisoner exchange could also be hampered by thousands of POWs
held by both sides who do not want to return to their homelands or
who fear persecution once back home.
   A U.N. report in August said officials who visited some of the
15 known POW camps in Iran reported that they appeared to be run
internally by Iraqi Shiites who had switched allegiance to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The report said that as many as 20 percent of the Iraqi POWs
seen by the officials appeared to be defectors. Tehran newspapers
have said up to 20,000 Iraqi prisoners have opted to stay in Iran.
   The U.N. report added that many POWs on both sides fear
persecution if they go home and said Iraqi prisoners might riot if
repatriation is attempted.
   Many Iranians were also hesitant about being exchanged, the
report said.

<HEAD>Talk of Lisbon: Bringing Back a Burned-Out Chiado</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The talk of Lisbon these days is about
the Chiado, the 10-block area of 19th-century department stores and
shops swept by fire Aug. 25.
   Most of the talk centers on the Chiado's future in the heart of
the city.
   Will it be restored to what it was? Will modern high-rises win
out?
   ``I think they will have to preserve the facades of the district
_ it will have to look like it did before,'' said Joao Bento, a
26-year-old bank employee.
   Experts say facades of 18 of the 20 buildings damaged by the
fire are restorable.
   Even while the embers were still glowing on rua do Carmo and rua
Garrett, many Lisbonites began to worry that municipal authorities
would commission an up-market, high-rise development on the ashes.
   ``No one can have the illusion the Chiado will be what it was,''
said Alvaro Siza Vieira, an architect recently appointed by Mayor
Nuno Kruz Abecasis to plan the restoration. ``Even the dirt
engrained on the tiled facades was part of the atmosphere.''
   But Siza Vieira is not seen as likely to suggest a sprawling
hi-tech plan and has made his proposals subject to vetting by the
Portuguese Architects Association.
   But whatever form it takes, the ``new'' Chiado is expected to
point the way for the rest of this historic city, whose buildings
exhibit a ravishing collage of architectural styles but are in dire
need of restoration.
   Pedro Brandao, secretary general of the Architects Association,
said the organization wants a competition among local architects to
form a development team for the whole historic area of the Baixa,
Lisbon's lower city that was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake and
of which the Chiado is just one part.
   But Chiado watchers have concerns other than architecture,
provided the proposed plan does not involve complexes of apartments
of glass and aluminum.
   Author Jose Victor Adragao, for example, maintains that the
Chiado is cherished as much as anything else for its ``air, sounds,
smell of violets and roasting chestnuts, strolls and sandwiches
before the opera _ and because it is Lisbon.''
   Goncalo Ribeiro Teles, City Council member for the
ecology-conscious Monarchist Party, cautions: ``In other parts of
the city big businesses and banks have sprung up where cafes and
restaurants once were and have killed the city. The offices close
early, people leave and the area dies.''
   Insurers say the inferno caused $300 million in material damage,
but the Lisbon Shopkeepers Association estimates losses at double
that figure.
   Many small shopkeepers were under-insured at the time of the
fire and might not be able to afford to move into a new Chiado
commercial center, despite cheap loans from a $32.5-million
government credit line offered to traders to help them get back in
business.
   The lack of cash could also cast a pall on Ribeiro Teles' hopes
of handing back new Chiado apartments to the area's pre-blaze
residents who benefited from long-standing rent control.
   New apartments on expensive city center ground mean new leases
and higher rents, forcing former low-income residents out of a new
residential Chiado. The fire rendered 300 people homeless and left
1,200 shopworkers unemployed. Two people were killed in the fire
and 43 were injured.
   Alternative plans to keep the Chiado alive would be hotels or
student accommodations.
   One banker said he had already received hundreds of phone calls
from investors, mainly Japanese and Germans, asking to secure
pockets of land in the neighborhood.
   But the problem, Ribeiro Teles said, ``involves the whole of
Lisbon's historic zone and is vaster and much more serious than
that of the Chiado.''
   Brandao agrees.
   ``For the Chiago to recuperate, great amounts of money are not
needed ... but to restore all the historic part of Lisbon, we need
a lot _ and we don't have enough for that in all of Portugal.''

   Thought for today: ``Sin has always been an ugly word, but it
has been made so in a new sense over the last half-century. It has
been made not only ugly but passe. People are no longer sinful,
they are only immature or underprivileged or frightened or, more
particularly, sick.'' _ Phyllis McGinley, American poet (1905-1978).

   Since airline deregulation became law a decade
ago, some fares have been cut and flights have been added to major
cities. But the average passenger also has less help in coping with
travel problems.
   The Civil Aeronautics Board that formerly watched out for
passengers' interests is no more, and while its functions were
switched to other agencies, consumer protection is less visible
than in years past.
   Buying an airline ticket today amounts to signing a contract
between the passenger and the airline. Both have rights and
responsibilities, and the Airline Consumer Action Project, one of
the public-interest groups founded by Ralph Nader, has prepared a
booklet to help.
   ``Facts & Advice for Airline Passengers'' can be obtained for $2
by writing to Aviation Consumer Action Project, P.O. Box 19029,
Washington, D.C., 20036.
   The government, too, has a pamphlet for fliers, entitled ``Fly
Rights,'' which costs $1 from the Consumer Information Center,
Pueblo, Colo., 81009. Order booklet 156T.
   Air fares can be confusing, with changes being made constantly
and promotional tickets with low prices and many restrictions being
advertised.
   As with any purchase, getting the best price generally means
shopping around. Find out which airlines fly where you want to go,
and compare their prices.
   A good travel agent can be a big help, but finding the right
agent also takes some work. Check with several agents and see if
one comes up with the lowest priced fares consistently, suggests
the Airline Consumer Action Project.
   Flexible travel plans also are important in getting the best
price, that group points out.
   Ask about discounted prices for flights that leave at various
times. Night flights are often cheaper, as are weekend prices on
routes frequently used by business travelers during the week.
   Travel to vacation resorts is sometimes cheaper Monday through
Thursday, since the weekend flights are more popular. And
off-season fares also save money.
   Beware of restrictions and non-refundable tickets. They may be
cheapest, but you may not be allowed to change your plans. And if
you can't make the flight at all, a non-refundable ticket is
worthless.
   Many airlines offer lower rates for military personnel,
children, students, senior citizens and clergy, so folks in those
categories should ask.
   There are many other travel considerations discussed in the
booklets including being bumped, lost luggage, delayed and canceled
flights and smoking rules.
   In the end what it comes down to is the need for alert consumers
and, if a problem develops, some constructive complaining.
   Most airlines have someone at each airport to contend with
problems, often with the authority to pay compensation for bumping
and to write small checks to settle claims for lost or damaged
baggage.
   If no one is available, or they can't help, complain directly to
the airline's office of consumer affairs. Keep the letter short and
business-like, stating the problem and what you want the company to
do about it. Be warned, however, that if you make excessive demands
many airlines won't take the matter seriously.
   If, after writing and negotiating, the airline still declines to
resolve the complaint, consumers can file a lawsuit or complain to
local and federal government agencies.
   While government officials can't force airlines to settle,
bringing them in may help. Consumers can contact state and local
consumer affairs offices and also can write to the Consumer Affairs
Division, Room 10405, Office of Community and Consumer Affairs,
U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW, Washington,
D.C., 20590.

   Once derided as weekend warriors and beset with
various image problems, the National Guard today is at record
strength, better equipped and better trained, abroad as well as at
home. While some regulars still grumble, the Pentagon's Total Force
battle plan puts the Guard and the Reserves into ``full
partnership'' with other combat forces. Is the Guard ready? Here is
the first of two articles.

   CAMP BLANDING, Fla. _ Beyond the canopy of live oak trees you
can hear the sporadic thumping of 105mm howitzers. Down near the
titanium mine a gaggle of clattering tanks is kicking up a cloud of
white dust. A column of ``rat patrol'' jeeps with machine-gunners
standing at their mounted M-60s bounces through the palmetto and
scrub brush.
   The Gator Brigade, trained in the jungles of Central America to
defend the Panama Canal, is back in camp.
   It's one of the refurbished National Guard combat units prepared
to go to battle within days, part of a strike force of state
militias learning to fight in foreign lands, 58 different countries
in the past year in fact, from Panama to Saudi Arabia, from Korea
to West Germany.
   Not since Bunker Hill has America's oldest military force been
counted on so heavily to provide a first line of defense. Never in
its 352-year history, most military authorities agree, has the
National Guard been stronger, better equipped, better trained in
peacetime.
   Spec. 4 Jeff Cleveland is flat on his belly at the firing range,
polishing his marksmanship with the M-60, the machine gun he calls
``your primary killing weapon.''
   ``I'd go into battle with these guys in a heartbeat,'' says
Cleveland, 22, who recently joined the Guard after he finished a
three-year hitch in the Army and returned to Stuart to help run his
family's nursery. ``They know what they're doing. These weapons are
in better shape than we had in Korea and you're a lot closer to the
enemy in Korea.''
   The National Guard traces its heritage to the formation of three
regiments in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636. It has
traditionally had a dual role as a state militia commanded by the
governor and as part of the national defense force.
   Today, with the Guard playing a greater role in national
defense, many officials are concerned about the home front. In case
the Guard is mobilized for federal duty, 23 states, plus Puerto
Rico and the District of Columbia, have organized State Defense
Forces available to help out in emergencies such as natural
disasters and civil disturbances, like the Home Guard of World War
I and the State Guard of World War II. In event of all-out war,
they would also be available to guard hydrolectric dams, nuclear
plants and communications installations.
   The structure and strength of the State Defense Forces varies
widely from state to state, ranging from largely social
organizations whose members are not allowed to carry guns and must
buy their own uniforms, to serious military organizations with
strict training requirements. None of the defense force members,
mostly retired military personnel, is paid.
   There is considerable debate over just how much control, if any,
the Defense Department should have and who should pay the bills.
Ninety-five percent of the Air and Army Guard's annual $9 billion
budget is federal money.
   Back in the woods at Camp Blanding is a command tent hidden by a
camouflage net and guarded by coils of razor wire. A sentry with an
M-16 rifle demands the password. There Judge Richard G. Weinberg is
holding court in battle dress, the new German-style Kevlar helmet
on his head, his face smeared with black-and-green greasepaint.
He's also wearing the star of a brigadier general as commander of
the 4,300 troops of the 53rd Infantry Brigade, the Gator Brigade.
   The Gator Brigade is one of the National Guard units that train
regularly in Central America, a practice that has drawn objections,
even lawsuits, from several state governors who contend that the
state militia should not be used as a tool of U.S. foreign policy.
But some units of the 53rd have been undergoing annual two-week
training in Latin America since 1972, mostly in Panama but also in
Honduras, Ecuador, Peru and elsewhere.
   Weinberg, a circuit judge from St. Augustine and veteran of the
82nd Airborne and the Special Forces, figures he has been to Panama
about 20 times over the past five years and knows the terrain
``like the back of my hand.''
   ``Should hostilities break out in Panama, we could deploy there
in three to four days,'' he says. ``And if you have to mobilize and
physically go to those regions in an emergency, it's a lot better
to train by actually loading the aircraft and moving out as opposed
to practicing it at an armory somewhere.''
   Send the National Guard into battle on foreign soil in three to
four days?
   That's the Pentagon's Total Force battle plan which puts the
National Guard and the Reserves in ``full partnership'' with the
regular Army and Air Force, counted on to provide about half the
manpower in a war. Some Guard combat units would be on the front
lines within a few days, with the rest to follow within 30 to 60
days. Some units would reach the battlefield even before their
regular Army partners.
   ``It was not but a few years ago that they said we couldn't
fight our way out of a paper bag, and here we're on the spearhead
of an invasion,'' says Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr., chief of the
National Guard Bureau, the liaison with the Defense Department.
``Baby, we've come a long way.''
   Half a million National Guard troops have trained overseas in
the past few years, at an average of 40,000 to 50,000 a year, many
participating with the regular Army in such exercises as Reforger
in Europe and Team Spirit in South Korea.
   They are doing such things as building roads and supplying
medical care in Central America and flying airlifts to the South
Pole. A team of selected volunteers from the Gator Brigade went
through a French commando school in Martinique this summer. During
a Reforger exercise, a signal brigade from Florida opened up a line
of military communications across Belgium, the first time that has
been done since World War II. A Florida Special Forces battalion
staged a nighttime parachute drop into Germany.

   And never has the National Guard had more soldiers to throw into
combat, including World War I, when 379,000 guardsmen hit the
trenches, or World War II, when 300,000 served.
   Today's Guard manpower is at a record level, almost at full
strength, with 460,000 in 2,043 units in the Army National Guard,
and 115,000 in 642 Air National Guard units. That's about 100,000
more than even during the Vietnam War when many young men joined
the Guard to avoid the draft.
   The fact that Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, the Republican vice
presidential nominee, served in the Guard during that period drew
some political fire, including allegations _ which he denied _ that
his way into the Guard was eased by family influence.
   Today's young men and women, who were only children when the
Vietnam War was going on, are joining the Guard for a number of
reasons, including an apparent resurgence of patriotism, the
adventure of travel to foreign countries and to fatten their
wallets.
   Under the 1987 Montgomery GI Bill, Guardsmen are now eligible
for free college tuition after they sign up for eight years and
complete their initial six months of basic training. They can get
up to $140 a month for up to 36 months full-time education. They
also get year-round commissary privileges, not just for the periods
they are in training. A private makes $89.52 for one weekend, for
example, and a staff sergeant gets $194.37.
   A National Guardsman must train a minimum of 39 days a year,
including an annual 15-day period and one weekend a month. And with
today's global exercises many volunteer for extra duty. On average,
Guard officials say, enlisted personnel train about 49 days a year
and officers 79 days a year.
   ``We are doing exciting things that we did not do before,'' says
Maj. Gen. Robert C. Thrasher, adjutant general of California, whose
26-year-old son joined the Guard and a college ROTC program, partly
because of the free tuition payments.
   ``Also, I think patriotism is returning to a degree. To my son,
Vietnam is kind of a shadow in the past, something that happened in
history.''
   President Lyndon Johnson decided against large-scale
mobilization of the Guard for Vietnam. Of the 3.4 million sent to
Southeast Asia in that war, only 22,745 were guardsmen. Johnson
feared it would lead to more public pressure to ``bring the boys
home'' if entire hometown units were sent to war.
   Johnson's decision didn't make a lot of Guard officers happy.
   ``I think it was a very stupid decision on his part,'' says Maj.
Gen. Francis R. Gerard, New Jersey's blunt-spoken adjutant general,
the last of the World War II ace fighter pilots still on active
duty. ``That's what we're in the business for.''
   Once derided as ``weekend warriors'' and armed with sometimes
defective hand-me-down weapons, today's guardsman frequently trains
alongside his regular Army counterpart with top-of-the-line
weaponry such as the Abrams M-1 tank, the M-2 Bradley Fighting
Vehicle and the Roland Air Defense Missile.
   The Air National Guard, which provides most of the air defense
of the United States, with two fighter-interceptors on 24-hour
alert at each of 22 locations, also has benefited from the military
buildup of the Reagan years.
   ``Today the Air Guard is in basically the very same first-line
equipment that the active Air Force is in _ F15s, F16s, brand new
C-130s,'' says Maj. Gen. John B. Conaway, director of the Air
National Guard.
   Like the Army Guard, the Air Guard is a full partner in the
Total Force, participating in global exercies. Air Guard fighters
are frequently scrambled to intercept Soviet ``Bear'' bombers
approaching U.S. air space. Air Guard tankers provided air-to-air
refueling during the strikes at Grenada and Libya.
   While the Guard is better equipped than it ever has been, there
are still some shortages.
   ``We need more of it, just as the active forces do, and much of
the Vietnam-era equipment is beginning to age,'' says Dan Donahue,
spokesman for the National Guard Bureau. ``But, yes, we get
first-line equipment, right off the assembly line.''
   Not long off the assembly line was a $5 million Q36 radar
directing the Gator Brigade's artillery fire at this 65,000-acre
National Guard training base in a sparsely populated area of
north-central Florida. The high-tech machine was in the care of
Chief Warrant Officer George Howard of Plant City, an IBM
technician in civilian life, a Korean veteran who joined the Guard
at age 16. He's seen first-hand the transformation of the Guard
over the years.
   ``Brother, there's no comparison,'' he says. ``The training is
so much more intense. We used to meet once a week and drink beer
and play cards. Now we hit the ground running.''
   How do the regulars, the professionals, the West Pointers, react
to this ``partnership'' with part-time soldiers?
   Gen. John R. Galvin, who started out as a private in the
Massachusetts National Guard and is now commander of the U.S. and
NATO forces in Europe, had this to say after observing a National
Guard unit at the Certain Challenge exercise in West Germany in
late September:
   ``I really have come to appreciate the Guard and the Reserve,''
he said. ``I'm really high on them after what I have seen out here.
The reserve components are bigger in size than the active
components, so they are absolutely of the first importance to us.''
   But many regular Army officers grumble off the record that
guardsmen are after all only part-time soldiers and they are not
ready to accept them as equals.
   A senior Guard official, who didn't want to be identified by
name, put it this way:
   ``It's like being black and living down South. They may not like
us, but there are a lot of us and we've got a lot of votes.''

   ``I think there is genuine respect for the ability of the
Guard,'' says spokesman Donahue. ``I think, on the other hand,
there is concern, perhaps justifiable concern, over how many
missions you can shift to the Guard just because it's an economical
way to do it.''
   The Army National Guard's budget of $5 billion for 1988,
excluding equipment, is only 6.4 percent of the total Army budget.
   ``The Army cannot go to war without the National Guard and they
recognize this,'' says Maj. Gen. Donald Burdick, director of the
Army National Guard.
   Specifically, under the Army's Capstone mobilization plan _
which was first conceived in the late 1970s when many Guard units
were at less than 65 percent of their authorized strength _ the
Army National Guard accounts for 10 of the Total Force's 28 combat
divisions. In addition, upon mobilization it will ``round out''
eight of the regular Army's divisions, providing a brigade for each.
   The Army Reserve would provide mostly support units.
   Would the National Guard officers themselves be comfortable
taking their citizen-soldiers into battle on short notice?
   ``Yeah,'' says Maj. Gen. Robert F. Ensslin Jr., the adjutant
general of Florida who served in the artillery in the Korean War.
``The 53rd Infantry Brigade is so much better trained and equipped
than any force in Central America, including the Sandinistas, that
I have no doubt they would acquit themselves well.''
   In its report to Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci for fiscal
year 1987, the Reserve Forces Policy Board, an advisory group
comprised mainly of generals, said:
   ``The reserve components in this decade have made unprecedented
progress toward readiness goals in the areas of personnel,
training, equipment and mobilization preparedness.'' The Guard and
the Reserve, the board said, ``are capable of accomplishing their
wartime missions.''
   But, the board pointed out, ``They are expected to maintain
mobilization readiness in less than 20 percent of the time
available to active components.''
   In tests of basic combat skills, conducted by regular Army
evaluators, Army National Guardsmen fall about 2 to 3 percentage
points behind the regulars, Donahue says. As far as the Air
National Guard is concerned, he says, ``You can't tell the
difference.''
   There are problems. While National Guard units are being
equipped under the ``first to fight, first to equip'' policy
instituted by former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger, there
are shortages of certain items, such as 2{- and 5-ton trucks.
   ``Critical shortages still exist in the areas of communications
and electronics equipment, tactical and support vehicles, engineer
equipment and individual weapons,'' says the report from the
Reserve Forces Policy Board.
   It estimated the dollar value of the shortages of equipment for
the Guard and the Reserves at $14.7 billion.
   Also, most of the aging trucks used by the Guard run on
gasoline, while most of the Army's vehicles use diesel fuel, an
obvious logistical problem on the battlefield.
   The National Guard is also trying to live down the stigma of
past scandals, especially involving the misuse of government planes
and construction equipment by some state adjutants general.
   Maj. Gen. Vito Castellano, the former adjutant general of New
York who admitted he was a liar, usurer and bigamist, was sentenced
earlier this year to up to three years in prison on tax charges.
   ``There was a certain amount of distress on the part of various
members of the organized militia to see their former commander in
the public dock as a criminal,'' says Maj. Gen. Lawrence P. Flynn,
who succeeded Castellano as New York's top militiaman.
   Symbolic of the new Guard in more ways than one is 1st Lt.
Pauline Beiswanger, an ROTC graduate of the University of South
Florida who has trained in Panama several times with the Gator
Brigade and volunteers to go back every chance she gets.
   In a military organization that once was an all-male club, she
is one of at least two husband-wife teams in the brigade. Her
husband is Capt. William Beiswanger, an infantry company commander,
and when they're not playing war games they run a restaurant in
Holiday, Fla.
   Mrs. Beiswanger, who also works part-time as a substitute
schoolteacher, is one of about 26,000 women in the National Guard
and one of the 2,700 female officers. She doesn't mind the rugged
training.
   ``From the day you hit camp, you're in the field,'' she says.
``I sleep out there and do everything and I don't think anything
about it. I don't think you find gender bias in the National
Guard.''
   Maj. Peter Paul of St. Augustine, an aide to Brig. Gen.
Weinberg, has a wife named Mary, a sergeant on the staff of the
adjutant general. He doesn't make her salute in private, but he
endures a lot of jokes about Peter Paul and Mary.
   Then there's Pvt. Yvette Velasquez of Orlando, a petite woman of
20 who is in camp for the first time with the Gator Brigade, a
nervous ``Pvt. Benjamin'' in her camouflaged BDU (battle dress
uniform), Kevlar helmet and streaked face. What is she doing in the
National Guard?
   ``I wanted a change in my life, a challenge,'' she says.
``Besides, I'm the only female in my family who had the guts to do
it.''

<TEXT>
   The civilian visitors troop
into the green Army squad tent one by one, pausing at the entrance
to slake thirsts born of a tropic sun with paper cupfuls of
Kool-Aid.
   They have come by helicopter to this dusty camp in a remote,
northern Honduran valley to see for themselves the work of Task
Force III of the U.S. Army National Guard.
   Using charts and maps on easel boards, the task force commander,
Col. Eldridge Casto Jr. and his aides explain their mission, to
build the final seven miles of a 34-mile road into the Yoro Valley.
   Casto, a spare man with a West Virginia drawl, speaks with pride
of the men and women under his command who have moved thousands
upon thousands of cubic yards of earth, crushed ton upon ton of
rock into gravel and forced a formidable path across towering
mountains.
   He speaks, too, of the hundreds of doctors and nurses of the
National Guard who have gone into dozens of remote villages to
vaccinate and treat men, women, children, cows, horses, goats,
sheep, dogs and cats for an array of exotic ailments seldom seen in
the United States.
   ``It is invaluable experience,'' the colonel tells his visitors.
``It is something we simply can't get at home.''
   So for three years running, thousands of National Guard members
have come to Honduras in the November-to-June dry season to work
for two weeks alongside regular U.S. Army and Honduran soldiers on
a project once known as ``Blazing Trails-86'' and now called
``Fuertes Caminos-88.'' The Spanish name means Strong Roads.
   When work is completed in a few days, Casto says, the Yoro
Valley will for the first time be open to the outside world,
permitting access to new markets by its peasant farmers and
creating the possibility of development in one of the poorest parts
of one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere.
   ``The humanitarian aspects of this project are immeasurable,''
the colonel tells his listeners, who include a bank president from
Sardis, Miss., a state representative from Washington and a
professor from the Georgia Institute of Technology.
   His guests this day number 28. Many are community leaders back
home and they have been flown to Honduras in a military version of
a Boeing 727 with an escort that includes Lt. Gen. Herbert R.
Temple Jr., chief of the National Guard Bureau in Washington, D.C.
   In three days of briefings and tours, they will be told of
National Guard training exercises that cannot be duplicated in the
United States, of the good that comes from accompanying civic
action programs that range from drilling wells and constructing
latrines to building orphanages and schools.
   They will see with their own eyes the shy, grateful smiles of
Hondurans in one of 80 tiny, northern villages as they receive
periodic medical and dental care from a team of regular Army,
National Guard and local doctors, dentists and nurses.
   When the visitors return home, it is hoped they will carry what
they have seen and heard to political associates, civic clubs,
church groups and the like, for the National Guard is increasingly
under fire for conducting training missions abroad and needs all
the friends it can get.
   The road being built by the National Guard is not simply a
farm-to-market route designed to bring progress to an isolated
valley. It is a military road, built to the specifications of
Honduran army engineers, and designed to carry the heavy weapons of
war _ trucks, artillery, even tanks.
   And the Hondurans wanted this road in this particular place
because the Yoro Valley has for years been the inaccessible hiding
place of a small but persistent band of leftist insurgents.
   It is the National Guard's involvement, however tangential, in
the internal and even foreign affairs of other countries that has
troubled some Americans. Several governors, including
Massachusetts' Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
candidate, have objected to foreign training of their state
militias, arguing that they are being used for a purpose they were
never designed to fulfill _ the projection of U.S. policy abroad.
   American political influence and the presence of U.S. military
personnel in Honduras, including the 1,200 members of Task Force
Bravo permanently stationed at Palmerola Air Base also bothers many
Hondurans. It goes hand in glove with their dislike of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels who have been operating out of base camps
in Honduras for more than six years in an attempt to overthrow the
communist government of neighboring Nicaragua.

   Despite vastly improved equipment and more
intense training during the military buildup of the Reagan years,
America's National Guard still has an image problem.
   The regular Army still isn't quite ready to accept the new Guard
as its equal in the Total Force battle plan.
   ``They're not exactly an orphan any more,'' says a top Pentagon
official who did not want to be identified. ``But they're still a
poor relation.
   ``Realistically, how do you integrate, train and equip a
part-time Guard on a par with a full-time force? I think you can
count on them to fight. But for the most part, you can't count on
them in the very first wave of the war.''
   Says one Army officer: ``They're better, but they're not ready
to saddle up and fight as soon as the rest of my division gets the
call.''
   Adds another: ``They're still part-time soldiers. That's what
they're supposed to be, and that's what they are.''
   On the other hand, Gen. John R. Galvin, commander of the U.S.
and NATO forces in Europe, observed a National Guard unit training
in West Germany in late September and commented later: ``I'm really
high on them after what I have seen out here.''
   Military officers on both sides of the fence agree the National
Guard is a much more credible fighting force today than perhaps at
any point in peacetime history.
   They cite a real push to modernize Guard units: better-quality
recruits; worldwide training year-round instead of ``summer camp''
at home, and a serious effort to require Guard units to meet the
same type of readiness standards as active units.
   Lt. Col. John Chapla, a spokesman for the active-duty Army at
the Pentagon, says the parent service is convinced that attitudes
are changing as the Guard's war-fighting ability improves.
   ``Generally speaking, the ability of the Guard and Reserve to
work with the active-duty units has been significantly improved,''
Chapla says. ``We are now better prepared to go to war as a total
Army.
   ``And with those improvements, the attitudes about the Guard
being just `weekend warriors' are dying out. The attitudes are
changing. We are not going to be able to go to war and fight
effectively without significant participation by Guard and Reserve
components.''
   ``That's the official line, and things have improved, but old
attitudes die hard,'' counters a National Guard officer, who like a
half-dozen other officers and officials agreed to comment if not
identified.
   ``You can see it when they watch us train. There's still a kind
of snobbery.''
   ``I'm sure the questions still linger in the minds of the
decision-makers: `How reliable are they?' `How well-led are they?'
'' says another Guard officer.
   What about the Air Guard, the other half of the National Guard?
Officers in the field and in Washington express no doubts about its
fighting readiness.
   ``The relationship between the Guard and Air Force has always
been different,'' one official says. ``You've got fly-boys who flew
for the active force, are still flying today for airlines and
keeping their hands in, flying fighters on the weekends.''
   ``The Air Guard almost always has to be with the active force
for training, while the Army National Guard can train in their back
yard,'' observes an Army guard officer. ``That's an important
difference.
   ``And they tend to be flying every day, in their civilian jobs,
too. The guys in that Army Guard unit aren't smelling ordnance
every day. You can't be a recreational artilleryman. But those Air
Guard guys never stop flying and the active crews recognize that.''
   The Army National Guard in the old days was widely regarded as
something of a political organization.
   ``It used to be solely a question of who you knew to climb to
the top,'' says one Pentgon civilian.
   ``That's changed a lot. There are standards for a state adjutant
general, for example. But the perception hasn't caught up.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They're a diverse lot, from the strictly
businesslike to the flamboyant. They train, with varying intensity,
as auxiliaries to the National Guard to deal with emergencies at
home in the event the Guard is called to federal duty. They're the
State Defense Forces, ``one of the nation's best-kept military
secrets,'' in one insider's words.

   Volunteer armies are forming to guard the home front, patriots
drilling without pay and often buying their own uniforms in the
tradition of the minuteman militias of the American colonies.
   Pancho Villa first signaled the need, but that's history, too.
   Today's militias train as auxiliaries to National Guard units
that are expected to be on the battlefield within days following
the outbreak of war under the Pentagon's Total Force defense
doctrine.
   To fill the void left when the guardsmen are gone, almost half
the states over the last few years have organized State Defense
Forces _ sometimes called the State Guard, State Defense Corps or
State Military Reserve _ with about 10,000 members all told and
with widely varying strengths and capabilities.
   It's not unlike the Home Guard of World War I and the State
Guard of World War II.
   ``State Defense Forces are one of the best-kept military secrets
in our nation,'' says Jerry Fogel, executive director of the State
Defense Force Association of the United States, a 1,000-member
organization based in Kansas City, Mo., that was formed four years
ago as the state militia program was growing.
   Some of the State Defense Forces are little more than social
clubs, some are serious military organizations. At least one was
disbanded by state authorities because its leaders insisted on
camouflage uniforms and Rambo-style training, including parachute
jumps.
   The uniforms of these citizen-soldiers, most of whom are retired
from the military, range from hand-me-down fatigues to dress blues
purchased at their own expense. Tuxedos adorned with insignia and
campaign ribbons have been recommended for social occasions.
   The militiamen's primary job is more that of policemen or rescue
workers than soldiers. In the absence of the National Guard, they
would be called on to help out in emergencies such as hurricanes,
fires, floods and civil disturbances, assisting local police
departments, civil defense and disaster relief agencies. But should
the United States be threatened by invasion, they would also be
needed to guard strategic installations, hydroelectric dams, water
treatment plants, communications facilities.
   Each State Defense Force is controlled by the state governor and
his adjutant general, the state's top military officer. Unlike the
National Guard, which is 95 percent federally funded, they get no
money and little else _ except advice _ from Washington. That may
change.
   The National Guard Bureau, the Guard's liaison with the
Pentagon, has formed a committee to recommend some guidelines for
organization of the State Defense Forces, dealing with such things
as training, who can be a member, what uniform they should wear and
whether they should be armed.
   In most states the militia is trained to function as a military
police force, focusing on such things as traffic and crowd control,
search and rescue and communications. Others undergo more vigorous
combat training, which the National Guard Bureau opposes. The State
Defense Force is not part of the National Guard but both are under
the control of the individual state adjutants general and often
share the same armories.
   George J. Stein, a professor at Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, and an authority on military reserves, wrote in Military
Review magazine that attempts to train the militias as potential
combat forces ``are a waste of time.''
   While Stein believes there is a need for militias in a
constabulary role, he says, ``It is difficult to guess whether
nostalgia or fantasy underlies the desire of some members ... to
get out into the woods with a map and compass, play combat infantry
soldier and prepare to repel a parachute invasion from over the
North Pole.''
   But the states may do as they wish and any attempt by the
federal bureacracy to interfere raises the hackles of some state
officials.
   ``That which they don't fund, they sure as hell ain't going to
control,'' says Maj. Gen. Carl Wallace, adjutant general of
Tennessee, the Volunteer State.
   But Wallace strongly believes in the need for a State Defense
Force.
   ``We realized in late 1979 or '80 that Tennessee would be in bad
shape if all at once Guard units were mobilized and taken out of
the state,'' he says. ``We'd have equipment and armories across the
state that could not be protected.''
   The Tennessee Defense Force has 840 volunteers, including 15
women, and is organized in four brigades across the state. Members
must be between the ages of 17 to 70 and include doctors, lawyers,
preachers and even a country music singer, Grand Ole Opry regular
Charlie Walker, a World War II veteran who is a lieutenant colonel.
   The members wear regular Army uniforms, which they buy
themselves, with distinguishing name tags and brass. They don't
carry arms and there are no requirements for special training or
meetings. Most units get together about once a month.
   ``It's a combination of a ceremonial and social club,'' Wallace
says. ``They're not getting paid, but they're interested. They like
to put on a uniform.''
   The Texas State Guard, on the other hand, requires each
guardsman to undergo at least 96 hours of training a year. Local
commanders can, and do, require up to six times as much, according
to Col. Tom Williams, the director of the Guard.
   With units in 123 communities _ including nine military police
groups who are trained as MPs for guard duty, traffic and crowd
control, security and search and rescue _ the Texas State Guard has
signed up only 1,230 of the 3,036 troops it is authorized.
   ``It's tough to get people to work for nothing,'' Williams says.
   The militiamen do get paid when called to active duty by the
governor, such as the 34 called up when Hurricane Gilbert hit the
coast in September.
   The Texas militiamen are armed with riot-control shotguns and
night sticks and wear green fatigues. There is a full-time staff of
three, including Williams.
   The New York Guard has a cadre of 615 volunteers but says it
could mobilize up to 18,000 if the National Guard were called up.
They train with pistols, shotguns and rifles and hold weekly drills
at National Guard armories. One day a month, on a weekend, there is
daylong classroom instruction. A weeklong training program is held
once a year, but attendance is not mandatory.
   With an annual budget of about $100,000, the New York Guard has
two full-time administrators _ a deputy chief of staff and his
secretary. Members buy their own uniforms but get limited
reimbursements for military expenses.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: major investigations.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One led to the indictment of former Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner,
who was a U.S. appellate court judge at the time of his conviction
on bribery, conspiracy and fraud charges in February 1983.
   In another investigation, more than 100 suburban officials _
mayors, supervisors, commissioners, police officers _ were indicted
on corruption charges.
   ``What we learned in those years was that a lot of these
activities were interrelated. In other words, that one person who
was paying off one official in one town also was paying off other
officials in other towns,'' Valukas says. ``So we developed an
intelligence base and leads for all these other investigations.''
   With each round of indictments and convictions, federal
prosecutors and agents grew more aggressive, Valukas says.
   They began plotting elaborate stings, using undercover agents
wearing hidden tape recorders and microphones, creating their own
crooked companies to bribe public officials, even staging phony
crimes.
   In late 1978 and early 1979, the feds began planning what would
become one of the largest undercover investigations in the history
of the FBI, code-named Greylord, a horse's name picked from a
racing sheet by an agent, Walsh said.
   ``The Greylord case was very difficult from a legal standpoint
because we had to allow undercover agents to essentially commit
state crimes and allow undercover agents to perjure themselves,''
Walsh says.
   ``You're talking about allowing agents to get up in state court
and swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth and
then lie about their name and age and occupation.''
   In the probe's undercover phase, 1980-83, the agents found that
areas of Cook County's court system rivaled the fictional
portrayals of justice on such popular television shows as ``Hill
Street Blues.''
   Take the case of Raymond Sodini, a judge since 1971 who pleaded
guilty to accepting $6,000 in bribes and was sentenced to eight
years in prison in May 1987.
   He presided over a smelly, cramped courtroom on the 11th floor
above police headquarters on the city's South Side that became _ in
the words of the federal judge who sentenced him _ ``a cesspool of
corruption.''
   Undercover agents found that five lawyers had formed what
prosecutors called a ``hustlers' bribery club.'' They bribed Sodini
for permission to openly solicit business from criminal defendants
stepping off the elevators _ an unethical practice known as
hustling in the legal trade, evidence showed.
   The lawyers also paid off court clerks and sheriff's deputies to
steer unrepresented clients to them. The judge once had to mediate
a dispute among the clerks and deputies over who was getting the
most bribes, testimony at his trial showed.
   Sodini pocketed more than $1,000 a month in payoffs from 1980 to
'83, federal prosecutors contended at his trial.
   ``There has been testimony that this sort of thing had been
going on for decades,'' Valukas says. ``And the reason it went on
for decades is that no one ever talked about it. The system
condoned it.''
   One lawyer, Edward Nydam, kept meticulous records of his payoffs
to judges and court personnel from 1979 to '83 and read them aloud
in court during Sodini's trial. He listed the amounts next to
initials like ``BM'' for bagman or ``MF'' for ``Moonface,'' the
nickname of one judge.
   Patrick Ryan, a former sheriff's deputy and drinking buddy of
Sodini's, testified that the judge twice called in to say he'd been
out late drinking the night before and wouldn't make the 8 a.m.
court call for winos and vagrants.
   Sodini instructed Ryan to tell the court sergeant to put on the
judge's robes and handle the ``bum'' call. Later in the day, Sodini
signed the orders entered by the court sergeant, Ryan testified.
   While Greylord uncovered outlandish behavior, the Phocus and
Lantern investigations into licensing, zoning and purchasing fraud
turned up classic Chicago-style public corruption, Valukas says.
   He points to the case of Consumers Tire & Supply Co.
   Fred Taich, who owned the company in 1982-86, routinely bribed
10 city purchasing officers to win more than $2 million in
contracts to sell tires, tools and janitorial supplies to Chicago's
park district, transit agency and five city departments, evidence
at his trial showed.
   After paying the bribes, Taich often submitted inflated bills or
phony invoices for equipment the city never bought to recover the
cost of the payoffs, Valukas says.
   ``But this being Chicago, he wouldn't just make up a
non-existent invoice, he would include tax _ for say $25,000 worth
of non-existent tires _ and then add in a profit. That's tax and
profit on the bribe,'' Valukas says.
   Taich pleaded guilty in May to mail fraud and tax evasion. He
was sentenced to two years in prison, fined $100,000 and ordered to
repay $131,000 to the city.
   Greylord has wrought significant reforms in the county courts.
   ``I think the system is very, very healthy today,'' Chief
Circuit Judge Harry Comerford says. ``I think what has happened is
the bad seeds that had integrated themselves into the system have
been removed.''
   The special commission appointed by Comerford in the wake of
Greylord, has recommended 195 reforms and many already have been
adopted, says lawyer Jerold Solovy, the commission's chairman.
   The Chicago Police Department also has cleaned house since the
early 1970s and its internal affairs department now works closely
with federal agents and prosecutors.
   The federal investigations, indictments and convictions of City
Hall corruption prompted the City Council in 1987 to enact the
first ethics laws in Chicago's history, says Simpson, the political
science professor. Several civic groups formed a coalition to fight
corruption.
   It can't be done simply by passing a law, Simpson says.
   ``There's been a certain perverse pride among Chicagoans in the
scandals and as long as that didn't seem to affect the operations
of government _ as long as the garbage was picked up _ it was
viewed as sort of a form of entertainment,'' Simpson says.
   Valukas says: ``We're making inroads but I still think we have a
long way to go. Although I never like to predict what the grand
jury will do, you can expect that between now and the end of the
year corruption will be a topic of news coming out of the U.S.
Attorney's office. It is fertile ground _ unfortunately.''

   It was an ancient art form among the Indians of
Alaska, a tradition that almost died out in the latter part of the
20th century. Now the totem pole is coming back, with a new
generation of carvers taking up where their parents and
grandparents left off.

<TEXT>
   Lee Wallace is descended from a long line
of totem pole carvers, but his father, like many other Northwest
coast Indians, gave up his craft for the sake of becoming
``modern.''
   Today the younger Wallace is part of a renaissance in the art of
carving. Totem poles are coming back.
   At 36, Wallace is an apprentice carver at Saxman, a Tlingit
village just south of Ketchikan where leaders are building totem
poles into a local industry. Saxman has opened a totem park for
tourists and hopes eventually to have a pole factory.
   ``I'm from a long line of carvers. My grandfather,
great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather were all carvers,''
Wallace says as his adz, an ax-like tool used for trimming and
smoothing wood, shapes a beaver on a pole in the Saxman carving
shed.
   His grandfather was so renowned he was sent to other parts of
the United States to carve poles for exhibitions, Wallace says. But
his grandfather died in 1950 and Wallace's father gave up the craft.
   ``It was a time when it was not popular to carve, or to speak
the language, or to dance. It still wasn't really popular around
here in the '70s when I went to school,'' he says.
   Wallace took up carving a few years ago when he lost his job as
a flight attendant. Now he says there's nothing he'd rather do than
shape centuries-old cedar trees into works of art.
   Stories like Wallace's can be heard throughout southeastern
Alaska, where native arts galleries are opening amid souvenir shops
and new poles are going up next to totems carved decades ago.
   ``I would say five years ago you could look at the carvers and
list them on one hand. Now there are carvers all over,'' says Bill
Trudeau, former program director at the Totem Heritage Center in
Ketchikan.
   About 25 people, Indians and others, are studying traditional
carving at the center, a city-run museum established to preserve
old totem poles.
   At Saxman, high school students are offering carvings made in
Indian arts classes to a store that could hardly find items to sell
two years ago.
   ``In the last five years there's been national and international
recognition of the art form,'' says Ward Serrill, president of Cape
Fox Tours, the Indian corporation that runs the totem park. ``There
has been a proliferation of books written. Consequently it's a lot
easier for someone to make a livelihood.''
   Totem poles were just one of many types of art produced by
Northwest coast tribes. They also carved copper shields, wooden
boxes, large fishhooks and the interiors of their wooden plank
houses.
   When whites explored the region in the 1700s, they found totem
poles at Indian villages along more than 1,000 miles of coast, from
present-day Washington state through British Columbia to Yakutat, a
village at the top of the Alaska Panhandle.
   ``The restricting factors are the trees available and the
tools,'' Trudeau says.
   Totem poles serve three purposes, Serrill says. Some mark a
place, others are mortuary or memorial poles. The third type tells
a story or commemorates an event.
   The three most common colors are red, from volcanic rock; black,
from graphite or charcoal, and a pale aqua, made from copper ore.
The pigments were ground and mixed into paint with a natural
adhesive made by chewing salmon eggs and cedar bark.
   Poles traditionally were owned by chiefs or other wealthy people
who commissioned them. Carvers were traveling artisans who enjoyed
high social status.
   Serrill dates the decline of pole carving to the late 1800s and
the birth of a movement to suppress Indian culture. Throughout the
first half of the 20th century, traditional Indian activities were
discouraged.
   In 1938, the federal government included pole carving in the
Civilian Conservation Corps program. Decaying poles were brought to
Ketchikan from a number of outlying villages. Master carvers, many
in their 70s, were hired to duplicate them and teach the art to
younger people.
   The group restored 48 old poles and duplicated 54 before World
War II broke out in 1941. Then it disbanded to build airstrips and
other military facilities, says Mary Kowalczyk, ranger for Totem
Bight State Park north of Ketchikan.
   Carving all but stopped in the four decades that followed. The
art was kept alive at only a few centers, including the University
of Washington in Seattle, the Alaska Indian Arts Center at Haines
and in the workshops of several Canadian carvers.
   Today, a handful of masters from those programs are teaching the
current crop of novices. There are about 30 carvers in southeastern
Alaska, eight to 10 of them masters.
   One of the teachers is Wayne Price, who is working with Wallace
on the eagle-beaver pole at Saxman. Price carves one side of the
pole, then Wallace tries to match it stroke-for-stroke on the other
side. The 250-year-old cedar they're shaping lies horizontal on a
platform in the Saxman carving shed.
   Sitting on a partly carved paw and sharing his dried halibut
between sentences, the 31-year-old Price took a break to tell his
story.
   He started hanging around the Indian Arts Center in Haines in
1970, when he was in junior high school. He later apprenticed
himself to an older carver and eventually began winning
commissions. Since 1982 he has carved 17 poles.
   Totem pole carvers are paid $600 to $1,000 per foot. Price says
it's not worth his while to work on anything under 8 feet.
   Carvers generally finish poles in four to six weeks.

   The first thing Curtis Runnels tells his
archaeology students is that if they were stranded on a desert
island they probably wouldn't last a day. The students then proceed
to fashion the primitive tools and weapons used by prehistoric man.
The premise is to show how modern technology is derived from
ancient technology, the connection between ``pre-tech'' and
``high-tech.''

   In a Boston University science laboratory, a
student trims the top of a clay pot with a razor-sharp chip of
volcanic glass obtained by striking a rock with a deer antler. At
the other end of a long table, another undergraduate struggles with
a length of sinew to reinforce his beer can holder made of rafea, a
kind of vine.
   Another student is making a spear-throwing device called an
atlatl which was used by prehistoric man to obtain dinner.
   It's all part of Curtis Runnels' archaeology class,
``Prehistoric Technology and Culture,'' where few concessions to
modern man are permitted.
   The general idea is to make today's high-tech students
understand that the evolution from flint knapping to computer
processing wasn't as simple as it may seem.
   ``We're more or less learning how it started,'' says David
Cowan, a 19-year-old psychology major from Los Angeles.
   ``It takes a lot more thinking to understand the basic stuff
than it takes to understand the modern technology,'' he says.
   Runnels, an assistant professor of archaeology, developed the
class four years ago when he was at Stanford University. Students
fashion arrowheads and clay pots, start fires and speculate on how
3 million years ago primitive man figured out how to kill a deer to
get the antler to chip the volcanic glass to make the cutting tool.
   On the first day of class, Runnels tells his charges something
they probably already knew but never really dwelled on: that they
are slaves to technology.
   ``If you were to be thrust down on some desert island
somewhere,'' he says, with considerable exaggeration, ``you guys
would be dead in a day.''
   ``We're so dependent on this division of labor and other people
doing our technology for us that most of us cannot manipulate our
technology,'' he adds. ``You can use a computer but you can't make
one. In fact, you can't even make your dinnerware. Metal or
plastic.''
   The course's basic premise is to show how modern technology is
derived from ancient technology _ the connection between
``pre-tech'' and ``high-tech.''
   Runnels starts with stoneworking skills developed millions of
years ago in Africa. Metallurgy is studied next, followed by
pottery, basketry and monumental architecture, such as Stonehenge
and the pyramids.
   ``There's a logic to this progression because what happens is,
as technology changes, society changes,'' Runnels says. ``There's a
complex feedback relationship between these two things.''
   As an example, Runnels cites what he calls the ``prehistoric
arms race'' some historians believe developed about 5,000 years ago
when someone discovered that weapons made of metal were more
effective than ones of wood and stone.
   ``All of a sudden there are new offensive and defensive weapons
in the world,'' Runnels says, sitting in an office decorated with a
bronze sword, a basket filled with spears and sticks, and a tray
holding fossilized acorns from 2800 B.C. Greece.
   ``Now new fortification walls are necessary. Now you've got to
have those weapons if those guys have got them,'' Runnels says. ``A
whole new ball game opens up because the specifics of the
technology make it possible to control it.''
   Runnels approaches technological advances such as metallurgy,
which was developed 8,000 to 9,000 years ago, by comparing the
techniques of prehistory with those of today.
   He grabs a lump of multicolored rock sitting on the edge of his
desk. ``You know what that is? One of the most fundamental building
blocks of our whole electric civilization is copper, and that's the
source of copper,'' Runnels says.
   ``All of our metallurgy, including supersophisticated alloys,
have arisen out of essentially the same metallurgical techniques
that were used in prehistory. The iron beams that support this
building _ that technique was invented in prehistory. The glass in
the windows and in the computer screen are right out of the glass
technology.
   ``All of this was done without any record. People didn't come
down from their mountain where they were recording the great deeds
of political and military history to talk about what was going on
down at the factories.''
   Since Runnels' students aren't aware of any of this, he has them
build a fire and make their own cutting tools so they can
appreciate how ancient skills led to more sophisticated ones and
also fell out of use.
   ``It really gives you a sense that they were not idiots, they
were not nincompoops,'' says Joseph Bloch, 21, a senior from
Morristown, N.J., majoring in ancient and medieval history. He made
an arrowhead he is quite proud of.
   ``It really looks like something you'd dig up,'' he says. ``It's
amazing that you can make something that was made millions of years
ago.''
   Most of the dozen or so students who take Runnels' class each
semester major in fields outside archaeology but were attracted by
the hands-on nature and the professor's animated style.
   The class's first-aid kit is used often, when students nick
their fingers with antlers and obsidian, the deep maroon-colored
volcanic glass that is used to cut everything from clay to twine.
   One of the few high-tech materials used is a kiln to fire clay
pots to up to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. Runnels says a natural
blaze would do just as well, ``but for some reason they won't let
us build a fire in the parking lot.''
   When he taught the class in slightly more bucolic Palo Alto,
Calif., Runnels' did in fact have the class build a fire in the
woods. They roasted wienies and marshmallows, just like in
prehistory.
   ``Making fire is a lot harder to do than you'd think,'' says
Lara Prihodko, 20, a sophomore archaeology major with a new-found
appreciation for matches. ``It took like five people to do it.''

   To get to the offices of ``The Van Dyke
Show'' at Culver Studios you have to go to the rear of the building
and climb two flights of iron stairs.
   ``Maybe if the show does well we'll get new offices without
stairs,'' says Dick Van Dyke.
   In a new half-hour comedy on CBS, Van Dyke and his son, Barry,
play a father and son who team up to run a struggling regional
theater in a rural town in Pennsylvania. Barry gives up a career in
advertising to pursue his dream of running the theater. Dick is a
famous stage and screen star who stops off to see his son and is
dragooned into an effort to salvage the risky venture.
   ``The Van Dyke Show'' has its own hard climb ahead.
   The show is paired with Mary Tyler Moore's new sitcom on CBS on
Wednesday nights. Both shows premiere Oct. 26, although Miss
Moore's show is as yet untitled. It's a comeback effort for both of
them, once among the most beloved entertainers on television. It's
been a long time since either has had a hit show.
   ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960s, which also starred Miss
Moore, is a classic that makes just about everyone's list of
favorite shows. His next situation comedy was only moderately
successful, and his attempt at a variety show, ``Van Dyke and
Company,'' was a quick failure. His last regular appearance was on
``The Carol Burnett Show'' in 1977. He hasn't had his own show in
12 years.
   ``There's no talk that I know of to have Mary and I visit each
other's shows,'' Van Dyke says. ``But if I don't deliver her some
ratings she may drop in on me.''
   Barry Van Dyke has been in four series, ``The Harvey Korman
Show,'' ``Battlestar Galactica,'' ``Gun Shy'' and ``The Redd Foxx
Show,'' but none was a success.
   ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in the 1970s was another gem. But
two attempts at a variety show didn't work, nor did Miss Moore's
next comedy series in 1985-86.
   Both Van Dyke and Miss Moore face formidable competition on
Wednesday nights from ABC's ``Growing Pains'' and ``Head of the
Class'' and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   ``The Van Dyke Show'' also stars Kari Lizer as Barry's wife,
Barry O'Sullivan as their son, Whitman Mayo as the stage manager
and Maura Tierny as the woman who runs the ticket office.
   The show has also run into creative problems.
   ``We discarded the pilot because it wasn't right,'' says the
senior Van Dyke. ``We've made some changes in the concept and in
the cast. I think in the pilot we tried to get in so much
background exposition that we forgot to be entertaining. Our
relationship is no longer so adversarial.''
   Barry says, ``We had too much conflict and not enough comedy. It
was real but it wasn't funny. We've gotten rid of all the
background where he had been an absentee father and I was
resentful. We deal more with the present and the future: how a play
will be done, whether I'm going to let him help me out
financially.''
   ``We'll probably get into generational differences, such as how
to raise a child,'' adds Dick.
   All three of Van Dyke's comedies have centered on shows within
the show. In the first he was a writer on ``The Alan Brady Show,''
with Carl Reiner playing Brady. In the second show he was the host
of a local television talk show. And in the present show the focus
is the theater.
   The elder Van Dyke is well-tanned and his jaw juts out like a
snowplow beneath thick white hair. He wears a blue pullover sweater
with rimless glasses hanging from his neck, white sailing pants and
sneakers without socks. Barry looks like a younger version, but is
more conservatively dressed in darker clothes.
   This is their first real collaboration, although Barry made his
television debut on Dick's ``Morning Show'' on CBS in 1955. ``I'd
come out and say, `Daddy,''' he recalls.
   His acting debut was on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' at the age of
9 in 1962. He later worked as an associate producer on ``The New
Dick Van Dyke Show'' and made occasional appearances in small parts.
   ``Alan Brady had a talent show and I came in and played a
violin,'' Barry says of his debut performance. ``I was actually
taking violin lessons at the time. But that got me hooked on
acting. To a 9-year-old it looked like a great way to make a
living. Dad held me back until I was older.''
   Dick says he may use some of his own stage appearances for the
series. He won a Tony as best supporting actor for ``Bye Bye
Birdie.'' His last appearance on Broadway came when he took ``The
Music Man'' on the road and finished the tour at the City Center in
New York.

   In this city that boasts an extraordinary
symphony orchestra and a first-rate art museum, Josephine Abady
hopes to provide something it never has had before _ a world-class
theater.
   Her formidable task is to wake up the slumbering Cleveland Play
House, a regional theater long on history and short on artistic
excitement. For more than 70 years the theater has been part of
Cleveland's cultural life, alive but rarely making waves or
attracting attention.
   That changed after Abady arrived in January as the theater's
artistic director and began planning 13 productions on three stages
for her 1988-89 season. One of the first things she did was fire
the company's resident acting troupe, including some members who
had been employed for 25 years or more. There were protests from
some longtime subscribers, unhappy Play House board members and
angry letters to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
   ``I'm not the most popular girl in Cleveland,'' Abady says now.
``It was a very, very difficult decision to make, but this theater
had become very insular. It had used the same actors over and over.
So the quality and level of performance and production here had
become very small.''
   Abady will now cast each show separately, bringing in what she
says will be the best actors and directors she can find. And she
has a budget of $4.8 million, up $1 million from the previous
season, to bring her plans to fruition.
   She also brought in her own production staff, including a
literary manager and a company director, to strengthen the artistic
side of the operation. And she began putting together a season she
hoped would attract audiences and stop the downward spiral of
subscribers. They now number about 12,000, about half of the
capacity of the Play House's three theaters.
   What she devised was a fascinating mixture of the old and the
new.
   Her first production, although not part of the first season's
subscription series, was ``Born Yesterday,'' by Garson Kanin and
starring Ed Asner and Madeline Kahn. They were two big names who
might lure back audiences who stopped going to the Play House.
Abady directed the revival herself and after the September opening
in Cleveland, the play is on a long national tour before arriving
on Broadway next January. When it does, the Play House will gain
further visibility as one of its producers.
   Currently on her agenda is ``On the Waterfront,'' the world
premiere of the stage version of Budd Schulberg's novel of the same
name, adapted by Schulberg and Stan Silverman. Grant Show, of
television's ``Ryan's Hope,'' plays Terry Malloy, the role made
famous by Marlon Brando in the film, and Abady will direct again.
It will run through Nov. 20.
   ``I wanted to start off the subscription season here with
something that is new and dynamic but also familiar enough that
people who hadn't been coming to the Play House might be
attracted,'' Abady says. ``Something that was related to this
community without being a local play. And then I remembered that
Cleveland is redeveloping its waterfront.''
   For the rest of the season that ends next May, she has several
new plays including ``Italian-American Reconciliation'' by John
Patrick Shanley, who won an Oscar for his ``Moonstruck''
screenplay, and ``Real Dreams,'' a play set in Cleveland but
written by an Englishman. More traditional offerings include the
musical ``Carnival,'' directed by Jack Hofsiss; the London and
Broadway hit ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' and an all-black cast in
``The Glass Menagerie,'' starring Ruby Dee.
   ``Most of the stuff is new because I think if a theater is going
to make its mark on the community and, ultimately, the theatrical
world at large, you have to generate work as well as reproduce
work,'' Abady says. ```Born Yesterday' is a loving revival, but you
also have to do things like `Waterfront' and `Italian-American
Reconciliation'' and `Real Dreams.'''

   It's that community awareness and national profile that the
Cleveland Play House wants.
   The company certainly has the facilities: Its three-theater
complex looks like a red-brick medieval village rising out of the
ruins of the city's run-down East Side, an area still recovering
from the riots of the late 1960s.
   Behind the three theaters stands an old Sears, Roebuck
department store purchased by the Play House in 1980. The building,
now renovated, holds production facilities, some 200,000 square
feet of space where sets, costumes and props can be stored and
where rehearsals are held. What was once the ladies lingerie
department is now a private club and restaurant for theater
subscribers.
   Two of its theaters were built, side by side, in 1927 and a
third, larger theater, designed by Philip Johnson, was opened in
1983. Johnson linked all three theaters together with a huge
rotunda and added connecting passageways.
   ``This theater has always been a family affair. When they built
this building, it stopped being a family affair,'' Abady says,
referring to the Johnson project. ``It costs $1 million a year to
run it before there is the first bit of art on stage. Like a lot of
institutions, they had the edifice complex for a while.''
   Despite its long history, the Play House has had only a half
dozen or so artistic directors. The theater was founded in 1915 but
didn't really start developing until 1921 when Frederic McConnell
and K. Elmo Lowe came from Pittsburgh to run it. By the time Lowe
retired in 1969, their reign had lasted nearly 50 years. The
company had become a family. It also had its share of famous
graduates _ performers such as Joel Grey, Paul Newman, Margaret
Hamilton, Alan Alda and Dom DeLuise played the theater.
   In the 1970s, the theater was directed by Richard Oberlin who
had been trained by McConnell and Lowe. By the end of the decade,
critics were starting to grumble about the quality of the
productions. Some called the Play House dull, one step up from
community theater.
   The malaise continued into the '80s, and when Oberlin resigned
in 1985 William Rhys was named acting director. Rhys took over the
theater, while the board began its search for a permanent artistic
director who would be a strong leader. They found her in the
Berkshires.
   The 39-year-old Abady has made a lot of difficult decisions in
her career. For nine years, she ran the Berkshire Theater Festival
in Stockbridge, Mass. She eliminated the festival's deficit, set up
an endowment fund, reconditioned the theater and made it a center
for American drama. The festival even started to develop a national
profile, coming out from under the shadow of the Williamstown
Theater Festival, a star-studded summer troupe that also operates
in the Berkshires.
   ``I probably could have done that job for the rest of my life,''
Abady says. ``But I felt I wanted a new challenge, and I was afraid
of getting stale.''
   Abady will be a visible artistic director in Cleveland.
Brochures for the new season proclaim, ``Josephine Abady is coming
to town.'' Her name is stamped on the product, whether it succeeds
or not.
   ``My theory of management has always been the same, although
managers probably will have a fit,'' she says. ``You hire really
good people to do their jobs, tell them what the parameters are and
then you leave them alone. I've always had good people working for
me.
   ``If you make the environment for actors, directors and staff a
really productive one, where people feel they have a stake in the
outcome, it's easy to get good people,'' Abady says. ``The beauty
and thrill of the theater is that it's a collaborative process, if
it happens correctly. That's what I want to institute here.''

<HEAD>Most Valuable Ancient Tomb in Hemisphere Barely Saved From Robbers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SIPAN, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grave robbers came within 3 feet of making
off with the contents of the most valuable ancient tomb ever found
in the Western Hemisphere before Peruvian archaeologists with the
help of police beat them to it.
   Thus was saved the tomb of the Great Lord of Sipan, which one
American specialist says ranks with King Tut's tomb in Egypt as one
of the world's most important looks back to ancient times.
   The Sipan discovery was announced Sept. 13 by the National
Geographical Society in Washington, D.C., but details of how close
the grave robbers had come and how they worked were made known
recently here at the site.
   ``They were close to reaching him,'' said Walter Alva, director
of Peru's Bruning Archaeological Musuem, which conducted the
excavation. ``If they had, they would have destroyed his tomb and
we would not now have a discovery of incalculable value that will
allow us to know better the ancient Peruvians.''
   The archaeologists were tipped off to the grave robbers by other
robbers angry because they were not included in the plan.
   The robbers, who worked around the clock with a system of
sentries, succeeded in making off with peripheral treasures, but
the tomb itself was found intact by the archaeologists who were
able to perserve its contents and clues to a warring people who
preceded the Incas and made a desert bloom.
   But it took a police raid and gunplay near the site to finally
secure the area for the archaelogists to move in.
   The Great Lord of Sipan, a name given him by archaeologists,
ruled over a vast desert kingdom in what now is northern Peru. He
died in his mid-30s and lay unmolested for 1,500 years before the
grave robbers started their encroachment.
   His burial chamber contained finely crafted gold jewelry worth
half a million dollars and more than 1,200 ceramic vessels with
painted scenes of daily life of the Moche people, one of the
earliest civilizations of the Americas.
   The tomb, found on the upper platform of a pyramid near the
coastal village of Sipan 500 miles northwest of Lima, has
astonished archaeologists for its wealth and the information it
contains about a little known culture.
   The find also has focused a spotlight on the shadowy world of
international artifact smuggling and its impact on Peru, an
impoverished nation without the resources to protect and
investigate hundreds of pre-Columbian temples.
   ``This is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically in
the Western Hemisphere. The quality of the gold work is stunning,''
Dr. Christopher Donnan, an expert on ancient Peru, told a news
conference in Washington when the discovery was announced at the
headquarters of the National Geographic Society, which financed the
excavation.
   The importance of the tomb's contents to archaeology ranks with
the discovery in 1922 of King Tutankhamen's burial place in Egypt,
Donnan said. He is the director of the Museum of Cultural History
at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   The cache contained, among other items, a gold face mask, a
2-foot-wide solid gold crown, a gold knife, two strands of large
gold and silver beads shaped like peanuts and a gold warrior's
shield weighing almost 2 pounds.
   The Lord of Sipan was a warrior-priest with administrative
powers. He was about 35 at death and was 5{ feet tall.
   Buried with him were a dog, apparently a favorite pet; a child;
three young women, possibly wives or concubines; and three men,
including one believed to be a sentry, whose feet had been cut off
to prevent him from abandoning his duty of guarding the tomb in the
next life.
   ``Imagine the power he had! All those people were sacrificed and
entombed with him,'' said Luis Chero, resident archaeologist at the
site. ``He was a great lord with absolute control over the lives of
his subjects.'
   The tomb was at one end of a ceremonial, adobe-brick platform
230 feet long, 166 feet wide and 33 feet high.
   The 150-foot-high pyramid, called Huaca Rajada by local
villagers, juts up out of miles of surrounding sugar cane fields,
some of them still watered by canals built by the Moche, according
to Juan Martinez, an archaeologist on the excavation.

<HEAD>SIPAN: the excavation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists say the Moche people were a warring nation given
to human sacrifice, highly skilled in metallurgy and proficient in
using complex irrigation systems to make desert lands produce
bountiful harvests of cotton and corn.
   The Moche dominated a 300-mile stretch of Peru's northern coast
from about 100 to 800 A.D. Their civilization mysteriously
disappeared long before the Spaniards arrived in the 1530s and
destroyed the better known Inca empire, which held sway hundreds of
years after the Moche.
   The Huaca Rajada pyramid apparently was a giant mausoleum for a
succession of Moche rulers, and archaeologists have recently
discovered a second tomb, now under excavation, of another
warrior-priest, although of lesser rank than the Lord of Sipan.
   ``It is as if we were making the Moche live again,''
archaeologist Chero said of the discoveries.
   The Moche did not have a written language. But Chero, whose
copper skin and high cheekbones are mirrored in the faces on
Sipan's golden masks, said the carefully placed layers of ceramic
vessels with descriptive scenes found in the first tomb were like
``the pages of a book.''
   Valuable information about the relationship of one object to
another in a tomb is irretrievably lost when it is plundered by
grave robbers, known here as ``huaqueros,'' a word meaning looters
that is a spinoff of the Quechua word ``huaca,'' for holy place.
   ``Pottery is not placed haphazardly in tombs,'' Chero explained.
``It always is meant to communicate something. What the huaqueros
do is terrible. They destroy everything and take the pieces out of
their context.''
   Huaca Rajada is honeycombed with tunnels and pock-marked with
looters' pits. A vertical tunnel that Alva said was dug by
huaqueros stops about 3 feet short of the burial chamber.
   Fifteen feet away near the top of the platform is another tunnel
20 feet straight down.
   It was there that huaqueros from the village of Sipan struck pay
dirt in February 1987. Working day and night with guards posted to
warn of the arrival of strangers, several dozen looters extracted
what is believed to have been a treasure trove perhaps as great as
that found by the archaeologists months later.
   Soon afterwards authorities noticed an influx of unusually fine
gold and silver artifacts on the clandestine antiquities market.
Some artifacts confiscated at the Los Angeles airport in April may
include items stolen from Sipan. Alva has traveled to Los Angeles
to study the pieces.
   Without a tip from jealous huaqueros, ``it would have been very
difficult for the government to learn exactly where the gold was
coming from,'' said Martinez.
   In a police raid in April 1987 at the home of one of the
families looting the pyramid, a ringleader was shot and killed and
some of the gold artifacts were rescued.
   When Alva and his assistants arrived at Sipan to excavate the
pyramid, the villagers accused them of trying to take what was
rightfully theirs and threatened them. The site is now protected by
armed police and enclosed by a 10-foot-high barbed wire fence.
   ``Many people in Sipan say their families have dug through the
temples around here for generations,'' Martinez said.
   Taking artifacts from ancient temples is prohibited, but Peru
lacks the funds to enforce the laws or to finance archaeological
excavations.
   ``There is no economic support in Peru by the government to
conduct archaeological work on a large scale,'' said Martinez.
``The government is interested in projects that give quick
returns.''
   Chero said hundreds of temples on Peru's northern coast have
never been excavated by archaeologists because of lack of money.
   ``Near Sipan alone, there are 15 pyramids. We have a good idea
of where there may be tombs,'' he said. ``But without money, we
can't excavate.''

<HEAD>Nationalist or Realist? Thatcher Scorns United Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cynics have long joked that Britain joined the
European Economic Community not to advance unity in Europe but to
make sure it never came about.
   After Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's latest blunt dismissal
of the ideal of a United States of Europe, some are saying the
cynics were right.
   But for all those denouncing the Conservative Mrs. Thatcher as
insular and narrow-minded, others are welcoming her approach as a
much-needed cold shower on what they view as a fantasy.
   The longstanding question of how committed Britain is to Europe
boiled up anew Sept. 20 when Mrs. Thatcher, delivering a major
policy speech in the ancient Belgian town of Bruges, expressed
fears that the European Economic Community, also known as the
Common Market, might become ``a European superstate'' imposing its
will on the 12 member states.
   ``To try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the
center of a European conglomerate would be highly damaging,'' she
said.
   ``Europe will be stronger precisely because it has France as
France, Spain as Spain, Britain as Britain, each with its own
customs, traditions and identity. It would be folly to try to fit
them into some sort of identikit European personality.''
   (An identikit is a set of drawings of various types of eyes,
noses, mouths and other facial features that police artists use to
put together a composite sketch of a suspect.)
   In references that make European-enthusiasts in Britain wince,
Mrs. Thatcher recalled Britain's defeat of Germany in two world
wars.
   ``Had it not been for that willingness to fight and die, Europe
would have been united long before now _ but not in liberty and
justice.''
   Next day in Luxembourg, undaunted by angry continental press
comment, she said ``a centralized European government would be a
nightmare.''
   ``Elephant in the China Shop of Europe,'' declared Italy's La
Stampa, while the Dutch newspaper De Volskrant said Mrs. Thatcher
wrought more damage ``than Hurricane Gilbert.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's fellow leaders were more restrained.
   Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece, current president
of the EEC, called on Mrs. Thatcher to explain ``the exact meaning
of her vision.''
   Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans of Belgium said: ``I am
disappointed but I do not despair. She is intelligent and I think
we have good arguments to convince her yet.''
   For some it was not so much the words as what France's Le Monde
newspaper called her ``raw and provocative style,'' which
regenerated charges that Mrs. Thatcher, America's No. 1 European
ally, has a money-grabbing, anti-foreigner attitude toward the EEC.
   Central to the debate is 1992, when the community's current
trade barriers are to fall, turning Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain into one huge market of 322 million
people.
   The immediate focus of Mrs. Thatcher's misgivings is the
prospect of losing tax-raising prerogatives, and a remark by
Jacques Delors, the French socialist who heads the EEC's European
Commission, that after 1992, 80 percent of economic and social
legislation would be handled from the EEC headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium.
   European leaders don't realistically envisage a United States of
Europe in their lifetime, but Mrs. Thatcher argues that the
cumulative effect of regulations emanating from Brussels may be to
create an additional tier of government encroaching on national
sovereignties.
   For instance, the European Commission is pressing for sales
taxes to be harmonized throughout the EEC, arguing that it is
essential for the single market. For Britain this would mean
imposing sales taxes on food and children's clothes, which Mrs.
Thatcher has pledged not to do. It would also mean cutting taxes in
Britain on liquor and cigarettes, a major source of government
revenue.
   Mrs. Thatcher's suspicions on the monetary front were
illustrated recently, when she bluntly slapped down an idea mooted
by European leaders to set up a European central bank. She also
refuses to join the currency-stabilizing mechanism of the European
Monetary System.
   At present, the European Commission's powers are restricted to
recommending and implementing regulations, while the 518-member
European Parliament, which includes 81 British members, is mainly a
talking shop.
   Real power lies in the European Councils, which consist of the
heads of government or, say, the Finance or Foreign Ministers from
each country. Mrs. Thatcher has had to compromise on key issues
like farm subsidies, but she would strongly resist yielding the
power of veto that each country now has on issues that affect
``vital national interests'' or fiscal matters.
   Meanwhile, British Euro-politics have been transformed. It was a
Conservative government that took Britain into the EEC in 1973
despite opposition from the socialist Labor Party and the trade
unions that finance it.
   At the time, the unions feared the EEC as the flagship of
multinational companies and unrestricted imports and until 1983 the
Labor Party was pledged to pull Britain out.
   Now, the unions see Europe-wide social legislation from Brussels
as their best hope of winning back the power Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative government has taken from them.
   Delors got a hero's welcome at the British Trade Union Congress'
annual conference in September.
   ``1992 is much more than the creation of an internal market,''
Delors told the congress. ``It is necessary to improve workers'
living and working conditions.''
   The unions were delighted.
   ``The only card game in town at the moment is a town called
Brussels,'' enthused the transport workers' leader, Ron Todd. ``Now
is the time for us to learn some new rules, some new languages.''
   The Labor Party's foreign affairs spokesman, George Foulkes,
said Mrs. Thatcher had suddenly seen the future: ``A social Europe
looking after the interests of ordinary people ... frightened her
because she realized it would undermine the harshness of
Thatcherism.''
   Simon Jenkins, a columnist for The London Sunday Times, jibed
that Delors offered the unions a ``rose-strewn path back to their
former power: a paradise of Europe-wide restrictive practices ...
beyond the reach of any Thatcher reformation.''
   British mass-circulation newspapers, always chary of the EEC,
did not share the labor leaders' enthusiasm.
   ``She is saying exactly what the people think,'' commented the
4-million circulation Sun. ``They have no desire whatsoever to
become politically involved with foreigners with whom they have
nothing in common. ... European union is a dead duck.''
   Some argue that Mrs. Thatcher says openly what other leaders
won't admit publicly: that the EEC is primarily a trading bloc, not
a united political force.
   ``It is almost a tradition in many of the European countries to
pay lip-service to certain ideals and to have an understanding that
practice is a very different matter,'' commented John Coleman,
editor of the London-based New European.
   As for the public at large, callers to a recent radio talk show
were evenly divided between supporters and critics of Mrs.
Thatcher's speech at Bruges. A national poll done for the Mail on
Sunday, a pro-Thatcher weekly, indicated that a narrow 47-43
majority believe Britain's role lay in increasing ties with Europe
rather than the United States.

   Seventeen Americans served as state or
territorial governors before becoming president, although most also
held senior elected or appointed federal office before winning the
White House.
   The two most recent exceptions are Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan. Michael Dukakis hopes to become a third.
   The list of former governors who became president includes some
of the most distinguished chief executives and some who are
scarcely remembered.
   Thomas Jefferson, who was governor of Virginia during the
American Revolution, tops the list. Jefferson, the third president,
doubled the size of the nation by purchasing the Louisiana
territory from France in 1803.
   He had some training along the way, being principle author of
the Declaration of Independence, negotiating the peace treaty with
Great Britain, then serving as ambassador to France and secretary
of state.
   James Monroe, another Virginia governor, became the fifth
president after serving in the U.S. Senate, as envoy to France,
Britain and Spain, and as secretary of war and state.
   Andrew Jackson was territorial governor of Florida four years
after defeating the Seminole Indians in that state.
   His successor, Martin Van Buren, was governor of New York after
serving in the U.S. Senate, and was Jackson's secretary of state
and vice president.
   Other 19th century presidents who had been governors include
William Henry Harrison of Indiana, John Tyler of Virginia, James
Knox Polk and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, Rutherford B. Hayes of
Ohio, and Grover Cleveland of New York.
   William McKinley, the 25th president, was governor of Ohio for
1892-96.
   Theodore Roosevelt, who was vice president and took office after
McKinley's assassination, had been assistant Navy secretary before
resigning in 1897 to organize the Rough Riders in the
Spanish-American War. He was governor of New York for 1899-1901.
   Woodrow Wilson, who had graduate degrees in law and political
science, was president of Princeton University before serving as
governor of New Jersey in 1911-13. He was elected president in 1912
and invaded Mexico in 1914, the year that World War I began in
Europe. He was re-elected in 1916 with the slogan, ``He Kept Us Out
of War,'' but declared war on Germany the following year.
   Calvin Coolidge served as governor of Massachusetts for 1919-20
and for 1921-23 was vice president to Warren Harding, who died in
office.
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt was governor of New York for 1929-33,
after serving as assistant Navy Secretary in 1913-20, a post which
deeply involved him in diplomacy and logistics in World War I and
prepared him for his leadership role in World War II.
   Jimmy Carter served for one term as governor of Georgia before
his election as president in 1976.
   Ronald Reagan, a two-term California governor, defeated Carter
in 1980.

<TEXT>
   Sociologists have called comedy nightclubs an American
subculture. Sub no more. Stand-up comedy has spread to what used to
be called ``the sticks.''
   If any proof was needed that comedy clubs have arrived, it can
be found in Columbia Pictures' ``Punchline.'' It is a totally
entertaining view of the entertainment phenomenon. The only wonder
is why Hollywood took so long to get around to it.
   Tom Hanks is a medical student who is failing his studies
because he spends his nights in a Manhattan club, the Gas Station,
trying to make people laugh. Sally Field is a New Jersey housewife
and mother of three who plays hooky from home for the same reason.
   The Gas Station is peopled by zealots driven to make that big
score on the Carson or Letterman shows. Most of them haven't a
ghost of a chance, and some are pitiable. They join in a kind of
competitive camaraderie, like members of a college fraternity. The
house mother is club owner Mark Rydell, who can be alternately
merciless and compassionate.
   Field is exquisitely unfunny onstage with her dumb Polish jokes,
and you wonder why she persists. Hanks, on the other hand, shows
promise; at least he has the ruthlessness that comedy is reputed to
demand. Eventually he takes pity on the hapless housewife and
coaches her into an acceptable act.
   Suddenly the Gas Station is thrust into the big time, with a
network television competition staged in the club. The comics
compete fiercely, but only one can be the winner.
   David Seltzer wrote and directed ``Punchline,'' and he has
captured all the grit and grind, the heartbreak and the triumph of
stand-up comedy. Sometimes he oversimplifies: the climactic
telecast lacks logic; would any network allow uncensored comedy?
Also, the incipient romance of Hanks and Field is resolved and
anticlimactic.
   The performances are triumphant. Bust out all the adjectives for
Tom Hanks; following his ``Big'' splash, he is unquestionably the
front-runner in the 1988 Academy Award race. Sally Field displays
an unexpected comedy flair, as well as the earnestness for which
she is noted. Equally effective is Rydell, better known as a
director (``On Golden Pond'').
   ``Punchline'' was produced by Daniel Melnick and Michael
Rachmil. The rating is R because of the explicit language. Running
time: a breezy 128 minutes.

   ``White of the Eye'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS, $89.95; Beta,
$29.95; Rated R)
   
   Joan is on her way to Malibu with her hippie-like friend, Mike.
They stop in the desert near Tucson, Ariz., where she meets and
falls in love with Paul.
   Bad move, Joanie. The desert seems to have its way with women.
   And in ``White of the Eye,'' women drop like so many grains of
sand, hacked to death by a deranged killer who stores their body
parts in plastic bags.
   Joan's biggest problem, besides her self-indulgence, is that the
killer is husband Paul, who appears to be a normal father and a
passionate lover. But he occasionally has the need to paint his
face, don a samurai hairdo, lay out Indian objects in some sort of
bizarre ritual and kill a woman.
   David Keith plays Paul with a quiet rage. Though police suspect
him from the start, we are led to believe his innocence. But the
script never quite explains what has led the successful audio
technician to be a homicidal maniac.
   Cathy Moriarty gives her sexy all to Joan, and does her best
working with the silly and sometimes farfetched dialogue and
situations written by China and Donald Cammell, who also directed.
   When Joan finds her husband's stash of spare body parts, she
calmly calls up a girlfriend and asks her to take care of their
daughter for the night. The reason? ``Marital problems.'' Be real.
   Despite a weak script and lapses of reality, ``White of the
Eye'' offers glorious camera work by Larry McConkey and nice
performances by Keith and Moriarty.
   The R rating is well deserved for violence. There also is sexual
content.

   ``The Last Emperor'' (Nelson Entertainment; VHS-Beta, $89.98;
Rated PG-13)
   
   Probably no recent film better exemplifies what a blessing home
video is than ``The Last Emperor.'' This epic, which won nine
Academy Awards including best picture, must surely rank with the
best films ever made, and yet hasn't enjoyed the box-office success
it richly deserves.
   Now with video, you can catch what many of you so foolishly
missed.
   Director Bernardo Bertolucci makes brilliant and seamless use of
flashbacks to tell the saga of Pu Yi who became emperor of China in
1908, the last before that nation was sundered by 20th-century wars
and social forces.
   Pu Yi is a fascinating, paradoxical historical figure because,
as the movie shows so movingly, this man born to seemingly
unlimited power is nothing more than a prisoner in a gilded cage, a
museum piece who takes a painful lifetime to realize how time has
passed him and his royal kind by. He is a pawn who thinks himself a
king.
   His whole life is spent as a captive _ first of the Forbidden
City in Beijing, later of the Japanese when they set him up as
puppet ruler in their captive state of Manchukuo in the 1930s.
Finally, he spends a decade in a prison getting ``re-educated'' by
the Chinese Communists who revile him as a Japanese collaborator.
   Bertolucci's feat is in no small measure thanks to the Chinese
who allowed him to film on location at the Forbidden City. It makes
for an eyeful.
   ``The Last Emperor'' runs 2 hours and 44 minutes, but is never
less than gripping. The film is rated PG-13, with a few very brief
snatches of nudity and a word or two of profanity.

   ``School Daze'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated R)
   
   At the end of Spike Lee's latest and eagerly awaited film, the
hero storms the campus of a black college yelling ``Wake up!''
Unfortunately, that call may be needed by many who sit all the way
through an occasionally bright film which seems to have lost its
way.
   Not quite a drama, never exactly a comedy, ``School Daze'' even
takes a stab at being a musical. Nothing works well enough to meet
the expectations created by Lee's first big success, ``She's Gotta
Have It.''
   The movie explores conflict between light-skinned ``wannabees''
(want to be whites) and the earthier ``jigaboos'' at Mission
College. The hero, Dap (Larry Fishburne) is leading protests
against the school's investments in South Africa and generally
trying to raise the social consciousness of his fellow students.
   However, his cousin, Half Pint (Spike Lee), aspires to join the
leading fraternity, presided over by the smug, sadistic Julian
(Giancarlo Esposito).
   Half Pint becomes a frat man, in effect, by bedding Julian's
girlfriend _ at Julian's insistence. Unlike Mars Blackmon, the
talkative, street-smart character Lee played in ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' Half Pint is simply a worm. Not many laughs there.
   Among the bright moments in the film is Ossie Davis' cameo as an
overwrought football coach begging his team to end a losing string.
Lee follows with an impressive game scene which never once looks at
the field, but charts the defeat in the sagging spirit of the crowd.

   ``Western Standard Time'' (Epic) _ Asleep At The Wheel
   
   With Asleep At The Wheel, it's always ``Western Standard Time''
_ time for American standards, Western swing style.
   This time out, singer-guitarist-frontman Ray Benson and his six
cohorts swing their way through 10 more songs they like to play,
from Glenn Miller (``Chattanooga Choo Choo'') to Commander Cody and
His Lost Planet Airmen (``Hot Rod Lincoln'').
   For the most part, these are reverential renditions of
certifiably great American music.
   ``San Antonio Rose,'' the signature song of the king of Western
swing, Bob Wills, is served up almost too neatly, with Benson
resonant but overly controlled in the footsteps of Tommy Duncan,
Wills' longtime lead singer.
   Another standard, ``Walking the Floor Over You,'' works better,
going for the spirit of that great country classic, down to a
pretty good job of sounding like Ernest Tubb _ which can't be an
easy thing to do.
   ``Chattanooga Choo Choo'' finds Benson and Willie Nelson
swapping vocals over a heavy horn arrangement, making a song that's
become a cliche interesting again. Nelson shows he could have been
a fine orchestra crooner _ a country Crosby, if you will.
   Weakest are two Side 2 throwaways: an overly serious ``Roly
Poly,'' a silly ode to obesity; and the instrumental ``Sugarfoot
Rag,'' for aficionados only.
   Western swing seems to be making sort of a comeback these days;
George Strait's Ace In The Hole Band is a prime example. And that
must bring some feeling of vindication to Asleep At The Wheel, a
proudly anachronistic band pledged for 18 years now to the
perpetuation of an underappreciated art form.
   Despite this album's limitations, when it was over, I found
myself reaching for an old Bob Wills record. And that, I would
think, is the idea.

   ``Instinct'' (A&M) _ Iggy Pop
   
   This album is a shocker. Who would've thought that Iggy Pop
would still be alive to make a record in his 40s?
   ``Instinct'' can't be compared with the ground-breaking music a
young and crazed Iggy made as leader of Stooges more than 15 years
ago. But there's still a link evident between the Godfather of Punk
and such acts as the Sex Pistols, Ramones and Billy Idol _ all
metal minimalists with a theatrical shtick.
   On ``Instinct,'' the metal tramples the theatrics. Ex-Pistol
Steve Jones cranks out one thundering rhythm guitar riff after
another while Pop alternately snarls and croons like a cross
between James Dean and Dean Martin.
   The lyrics are dumb, but matched with such simple arrangements,
that's OK. Pop is heartbroken on ``Lowdown,'' mad at the system on
``Power & Freedom'' and on the run on the title cut. But most of
all, he's defiant. ``I ain't gonna be no squarehead,'' Pop sings on
``Squarehead.'' Then he barks.
   It's fortunate for his fans that Iggy still doesn't act his age.

   Orlando Gibbons, Second Service and Anthems (CRD) _ Choir of New
College, Oxford, Edward Higginbottom conducting.
   Thomas Weelkes, Ninth Service and Anthems (Nimbus) _ Choir of
Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, Stephen Darlington conducting.
   
   Gibbons and Weelkes were late figures in England's musical
renaissance, the last great composers of an era dominated by Thomas
Tallis and William Byrd.
   Gibbons, born in 1583, was appointed organist of the Chapel
Royal at age 21, and was named organist of Westminster Abbey two
years before his death in 1625.
   Weelkes, born around 1570, was appointed organist at Chichester
Cathedral in 1601 and died in London in 1623. Weelkes seems to have
been a bad egg, frequently at Chichester for drunkenness and foul
language.
   Both men are well known for their madrigals, including Weelkes'
``O Care Thou Will Despatch Me'' and Gibbons' ``The Silver Swan.''
   The highlights of the Gibbons recording come at the end,
especially a spirited rendition of ``O Clap Your Hands.''
Higginbottom's reading of the verse anthem ``See, See the Word Is
Incarnate'' is more languid but equally assured.
   Higginbottom chose to perform with organ accompaniment instead
of with a consort of viols, a choice which some listeners will
regret. The disc also excludes one of Gibbons' greatest verse
anthems, ``This Is the Record of John.''
   Those reservations aside, this is the most satisfying collection
of Gibbons' sacred music now available _ livelier than the
recording by the King's College Choir made in 1982 and technically
far superior to that by the Clerkes of Oxenford in the mid-1970s.
Both of those earlier recordings have recently been released on CD.
   Weelkes' exile in Chichester adds a touch of poignancy to some
of his greater compositions, which seem to have been intended for
the Chapel Royal in London rather than his provincial cathedral
choir.
   The disc from the choir of Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford
leaves no doubt about Weelkes' talent. ``Alleluia, I heard a
voice'' is a brilliantly effective song of praise despite its minor
key. ``Hosanna to the Son of David'' has become a Palm Sunday
favorite in many churches, and there are few songs of the period as
touching as Weelkes' setting of ``When David heard that Absalom was
slain.''
   The Christ Church choir gives a solid performance, if
occasionally marred by some raggedy trebles on the highest notes.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sally Field, a Stand-Up Comic?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sally Field, a stand-up comic?
   ``I never would have thought it would happen,'' she says with a
nervous laugh. ``And I'm not so sure it has.''
   Moviegoers seeing the new Columbia Pictures release,
``Punchline,'' may disagree. Yes, as a housewife who tries to break
in at a New York comedy emporium, she bombs. But under the tutelage
of another tyro comic, played by Tom Hanks, she manages to hold her
audience with her one-liners about domestic distress.
   It's hard to imagine the fundamentally shy Field trying to
squeeze laughs out of a jaded nightclub audience. She admits that
unlike her co-star, she didn't practice her role.
   ``I did no research for the character because I understand her
very well, being a housewife with three children and wanting to
have her life and her career; I understand all that,'' she said in
an interview at her rambling Brentwood house.
   ``The difficult part was doing the standup. I wish I could say I
did months and months of preparation. I tried to do months and
months of preparation, but I couldn't find the comedy. We wrote our
own comedy: Tom Hanks with his comedy team; I wrote with my comedy
team.''
   The day he got the part, Hanks started appearing in comedy clubs
in Los Angeles and New York, Field said, ``finding the comedy,
writing the comedy, getting onstage, making it work, honing and
twisting and pinching and pulling.''
   ``I went onstage once, with no material whatsoever, because Lily
Tomlin told me to,'' she said. ``I just talked to people. They had
to go home and say, `Let's never do that again, dear. You told me
to go to a comedy club. It was so dull.'
   ``I worked and worked and worked for about six months to find
where Lilah's comedy was, which is what my character was going
through. So it was actually happening to both of us.''
   Being bad in the early stages was not hard. ``That came easy to
me,'' the Academy Award-winning actress said.
   Her early training in such TV comedies as ``Gidget'' and ``The
Flying Nun'' provided little help.
   ``I have a sense of humor, a sense of comedy for Sally,'' she
said. ``I don't think it's terribly sophisticated; I don't think
it's terribly unique. I can hear my certain timing. But it's very
different to do a comedic scene in a film or even have a funny
evening in the living room with your friends than it is to stand up
on a stage with 200 or 300 people you don't know _ and be funny.''
   ``Punchline,'' which was co-produced by Field's Fogwood
Productions, is the first major film depicting the outburst of
comedy clubs across the country. The reason for the phenomenon?
   ``People may have studied the psychological reasons, but my
feeling is the country needs to laugh, the world needs to laugh,''
the actress-producer said. ``People need to forget themselves for a
while, because it is a troubled time.
   ``I also think that it is almost flirting with danger when you
watch stand-up comedy. You're almost stopping to watch an accident
happen. You're afraid that the person on stage will fail. That's
half the excitement: They are there throwing themselves off a cliff.
   ``They need one thing and one thing only _ laughter. If they
don't get that, they fail,'' she said. ``It's very dangerous, very
exciting. ... It is almost like throwing the Christians in with the
lions. The audience ... paid their money; they've earned the right
to be entertained. If they're not, they make it known.''
   Field at 41 is amazed to reflect that she is approaching her
25th year as an actress. ``Don't they give people gold watches and
put them out to pasture when they reach that point?''
   She was born into the business; her mother was a starlet, her
stepfather was Jock Mahoney, a sometime Tarzan and TV's Range Rider.
   Right out of high school she enrolled in Columbia studio's
acting workshop and soon was playing leads in series. She finally
escaped her Flying Nun reputation in the 1976 ``Stay Hungry.'' A
year later, she won an Emmy for portraying a woman afflicted with
multiple personalities in the TV movie, ``Sybil.'' Field was no
longer considered a lightweight.
   Academy voters liked her enough to bestow the Oscar for ``Norma
Rae'' in 1979 and ``Places in the Heart'' in 1985.
   Did she miss anything by going to work so early?
   ``Yeah, I'm sure I have,'' she said. ``I gained a lot of
knowledge and information. But there was a part of the tail end of
my childhood that I didn't have. It would have been nice to go to
college and be part of that kind of community when you're still
allowed to be young.
   ``I hope my children choose that. I have one in college now, and
that's why I'm feeling it. It's very important learning, growing
time.''
   The actress has two sons from an early marriage: Peter, 18, and
Eli, 15. Last January she and her second husband, producer Alan
Greisman, became parents of another boy, Sam.
   Field believes that she has been able to combine her family and
professonal lives, but she also said she's tired.
   ``I'd like to lie down for six or seven months,'' she said.
``I'm tired! But like a comedian who gets the laughs, it seems to
be worth it to me. I come home and there's my family, and they all
say `hi' to me. Usually I have the baby on my hip. I'm tired.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Understanding Art Through the Artist's Dreams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To understand the paintings of Vicky Montesinos
is to know her dreams.
   ``We all have our own universe,'' said Montesinos, a Mexican
artist whose work has been shown throughout the world. ``It belongs
to you only. Sometimes you allow others to be in your universe and
sometimes you don't.''
   The 44-year-old Montesinos is on show this fall at the Circle
Gallery in Soho.
   ``I feel like my own universe is full of dreams. A fantasy,
nothing that is quite visible,'' she says.
   That world of fantasy seems to be in Montesinos' blood. Her
father, Fernando Rivero, was a film director in Mexico City and
worked with such actresses as Susan Hayward and Hedy Lamarr.
   Montesinos recalls being in awe of those women.
   ``I was surrounded by this kind of fantasy. They were so
beautiful. I was thinking, `I wish I could be like that,'''
Montesinos said, adding that she doesn't find today's women to be
as glamorous.
   ``I don't know why. Maybe it's me. I'm sure there are beautiful
women around but I don't find what I used to find in those people.''
   The women in Montesinos' paintings are often colorfully dressed
with their hair hidden under elaborate hats.
   ``Basically, in all my paintings, the women have a nostalgic
look,'' she said. ``If I could choose to be in another life, I
would choose the 1900s in Europe. I have a lot of feelings for
those places. I have read a lot history books about what happened
there.
   One of her paintings is called ``The Venetian.''
   ``I get a lot of inspiration every time I go to Venice. I try to
go every year. It's a very serious place. I get inspired and try to
bring what Venice was in the 1900s to my paintings. I imagine
people dressed in a lot of gold.''
   Montesinos is concerned that people are more interested in
material gains than in developing their imagination.
   ``The values have been changing little by little. I find people
have really all their attention on making a lot of money; that
takes a lot of time and energy. Maybe that's one of the reasons
they really don't have time to dream.''
   Her paintings of men also have a dreamy, romantic feel.
   ``Capes and canes, long hair,'' she said. ``Not the type of man
that is here right now. They were more romantic. They could do so
many things that they don't do now.''
   Montesinos became interested in art as a youngster and was
encouraged by her father to develop her talent. She attended
college in Mexico and Argentina, studying with the Spanish artist
Jose Bardasano in Mexico and the painter and muralist Quinquella
Martin in Buenos Aires.
   She was inspired by Diego Velasquez and other Spanish painters.
   ``What they are doing is real, but it's also their own reality.
What Velasquez did, and Goya, was to paint, let's say some flowers,
but it was their own reality and had the feel of flowers,'' she
said.
   ``They were putting their own lives and their own feelings into
their work.''
   Montesinos had her first one-woman show in 1971.
   ``I really take painting in a very serious way. I know that I
have to paint and one morning I start painting. Maybe one day I'll
just paint the face, or use the corners. That's it. Without really
using a lot of thought.''
   In 1984, she began experimenting with lithography. ``It seemed
so complicated. If I was thinking of something in red, I'd have to
paint it in black. If it was in blue, I'd have to paint in black.''
   However, Montesinos caught on quickly and believes lithography
has helped her painting.
   ``It's more complicated than oil. You really can't make
mistakes. Whatever you put there is there,'' she said. ``You become
very disciplined. If you're going to put something in, it has to
work.
   ``Since I started doing lithographs, I've been painting much
faster. It's much easier for me.''
   Not only is she working faster, but believes she is allowing
more imagination to show up in her paintings.
   ``They are free; they are very free,'' she said. ``I'm not
concerned about making them real. I'm not pretending to make them
literal. Whatever it is for you, it's OK for me. If people ask me
to explain that painting, I ask them to explain it.
   ``What is art? Art is communication. The work of art
communicates something or it doesn't. Some people see something and
say it's terrible. Another person says it's wonderful. I don't
think you can give people only one layer.''

<HEAD>Foreign Plants Threaten To Change The Face of Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida is under invasion by a rapidly spreading
foreign army that threatens to change the face, and even the
climate, of the region. Many of the invaders were invited, to help
improve the economy or beautify the state, then turned on their
hosts.
   More than 400 foreign plant species have taken root here,
including the Australian melaleuca and Indian ficus that are
spreading alarmingly, and the Brazilian pepper tree and African
castor bean, poisonous to humans and animals.
   The danger to the Everglades is so serious that government
biologists say Florida's famous river of grass may disappear within
a lifetime.
   ``It is going to be very hard for any botanist in the future to
tell what is native and what isn't,'' says Julia Morton, a
University of Miami biologist who must drive two hours north along
the high-speed Florida's Turnpike to see native flora. ``Exotic
plants are multiplying and becoming so widespread they are taking
over.''
   Ironically, the most destructive species were introduced decades
ago by well-meaning experts who did not understand the region's
delicate ecosystem.
   The melaleuca tree was planted in the Everglades 80 years ago in
hopes of creating a lumber industry in what was seen as a useless
wasteland.
   Its economic potential proved elusive. Instead, the thirsty tree
from arid regions of Australia soaks up the water, muscles out
water-dependent species not used to competition, and the chemicals
in its bark prevent all but the hardiest birds from even landing on
it.
   ``Ten years ago in the east Everglades we only found 20
melaleuca trees,'' says botanist Robert Doren, vice president of
the state's Exotic Pest Plant Council. ``Now it has invaded 500,000
acres of the park, and 50,000 acres are essentially pure stands of
melaleuca. Within our lifetime it could dominate the park _ and a
lifetime isn't very long.''
   The resultant damage has economic as well as environmental
implications. Any major change in the Everglades will affect
surrounding waters, drying up Miami's drinking water and sabotaging
the shrimp, lobster and fishing industries in the Keys and Florida
Bay.
   One major factor contributing to the spread of the plant pests
is Florida's rapid development. ``Most of the plants that are a
problem do best in disturbed areas. You take a naturally balanced
area, then you build canals, roads, farms, and bring in a new plant
with no natural predators,'' Doren says.
   About half the 400 foreign plant species that have taken root in
Florida were imported for economic or ornamental reasons, said Ms.
Morton.
   One ornamental plant that may haunt Florida's future is the
ficus, a rapidly growing tree that can break up streets and
sidewalks and take over whole yards. The plant was imported because
it was thought unable to reproduce itself here, and therefore safe.
Dismayed biologists recently have discovered seedlings sprouting in
sidewalk cracks; the hardy tree has found a way to survive without
the help of man.
   Beside melaleuca and ficus, biologists generally agree Brazilian
pepper and Australian pine present the major tree threats to
Florida.
   Brazilian pepper, marked by red berries and imported as a pretty
bush, turns out to grow unabated in Florida's hospitable soil and
climate. It spreads seeds everywhere and has covered thousands of
acres of South Florida, growing as high as 40 feet with a trunk
three feet in diameter.
   The tree's toxic berries have been blamed for massive bird
kills, and it sickens domestic animals and children. The bark
causes a serious allergic rash and its pollen can be disastrous for
hayfever sufferers, Ms. Morton says. It, too, pushes out native
flora.
   ``A hundred years ago native coco plum trees, which produce a
nice edible fruit, used to abound all across the Tamiami Trail into
the Everglades. Now you will see very little coco plum and miles
and miles of Brazilian pepper.''
   The rapidly spreading Australian pine thrives in salty coastal
areas, can grow 10 feet in a year, and usurps the nesting places of
endangered loggerhead and green sea turtles, as well as the rare
American crocodile. Its branches break off easily, and its shallow
root system means a hurricane can easily topple it, causing damage
to anyone or anything nearby.
   Lesser-known, but potentially as destructive, pests are
spreading as well. The Australian acatia tree looks lovely to
landscapers, but its thick leaves will not biodegrade, leaving
litter that quickly clutters the ground
   A shrubby Asian vine threatens to clog coastal waterways, Doren
said. ``We find it on coastlines and in mangrove stands. No one
knows how it got here, but it does what kudzu does up north.''
   A Polynesian import, the lead tree, has been found recently, and
in 60 or 70 years, could be where the melaleuca is now, he said.
   Ms. Morton worries about highly poisonous foreign plants, many
of them attractive to animals and children. She blames a series of
unexplained horse deaths outside Miami on creeping indigo, brought
to the area by the University of Florida in the 1930s as an
experimental ground cover.
   Castor beans, which now grow all the way to South Carolina,
carry toxic seeds that are highly attractive to childrs who are elected
president ``rely on a brain trust. But
so does everybody else, too, as the field becomes more
specialized,'' said Hess. ``Even Richard Nixon, who was truly
engaged in foreign policy and made it his life interest, brought in
specialists,'' notably Henry Kissinger, who served as his national
security adviser.
   Graham T. Allison Jr., a Dukakis foreign policy adviser, says
the Massachusetts governor's ``style as a leader and governor is
quite different from either Reagan or Carter.''
   Dukakis' ideas ``come out of interaction with other folks. There
is a combination of progressive values and pragmatism that is
something special. It is not classic liberalism,'' said Allison.
   Carter's view of the world was shaped by his career as a
submarine officer in the Navy and his devotion to his Baptist faith.
   He appointed a strong-minded national security adviser, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, a Columbia University professor of Soviet affairs, born
in Poland and deeply suspicious of the Kremlin.
   Carter appointed a very different personality as his secretary
of state, Cyrus Vance, a Wall Street lawyer and veteran of senior
government appointments who was deeply committed to diplomacy and
negotiations.
   ``There were two world-views spinning around'' at the top level
of government, said Hess, and the result was a sometimes confused
and vacillating approach to foreign affairs that ultimately brought
Vance's resignation.
   Allison said ``Carter was very interested in detail. He had
difficulty keeping his mind focused on the big picture, and was
unable to resist an overly expansive agenda.''
   ``Reagan is very effective at projecting a few central themes
but does not involve himself directly in the issues, neither in the
broad shape of the issues or in the details. But he has kept in
mind a few simple things and knows what a manageable agenda is,''
said Allison, who is dean of the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, where Dukakis once taught and
where he turns for much of his foreign policy advice.
   Conflicting views of the world at the top of the administration
``were not Reagan's problem,'' said Hess. ``He had a distinct point
of view that the people who were working for him had no trouble
following.''
   Reagan survived several overseas debacles, including the bombing
of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983, but his hands-off
management style contributed to the worst policy crisis of his
administration, the exchange of arms for hostages with Iran.
   Clearly ``Reagan has had trouble with national security
advisers,'' running through six in seven years, said Hess.
   Dukakis has not said publicly who he might appoint national
security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected. But among
those often mentioned for those two important posts are Allison and
two colleagues from the Kennedy School, Joseph Nye and Albert
Carnesdale, along with Madeleine Albright, a Czechoslovakian-born
Georgetown University professor who served in the Carter White
House.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Dive to Site of 8,000 Year-Old Village</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Archaeologists who wear wet suits and
diving tanks are rescuing relics from an 8,000-year-old village 40
feet beneath the sea before water destroys the last remnants of the
ancient site.
   The village, which contains the remains of more than a dozen
stone houses, wells and cooking hearths, lies about 400 yards off
the Mediterranean coast, some 10 miles south of Haifa.
   ``It is the best-preserved, neolithic, underwater site in the
world,'' said Ehud Galili of the University of Haifa's Institute of
Archaeology and Maritime Studies. ``We are carrying out a rescue
operation because sea abrasion may soon destroy the site.''
   Each day for two weeks late this summer _ a search period
limited by sea conditions and funding _ Galili and about 10
archaelogists and volunteer divers headed out in a rubber dinghy in
twos or threes for hour-long underwater stints. One operates a
dredger to clear away sand as others search for artifacts.
   The project, in its fifth year, has yielded 15 human skeletons,
many of them almost intact; animal and fish bones; several pounds
of cultivated wheat and lentils; and stone and bone utensils,
including arrowheads, knives and bowls.
   ``Most neolithic sites are in poor condition,'' said University
of Pittsburgh underwater archaeologist Jim Dwyer, who returned this
year to Atlit for the second year in a row. ``Here we have the
chance to find everything ancient man used in day-to-day life.''
   The underwater village is the only neolithic site along the
Israeli coast containing skeletons, according to Galili.
Pathologists studying the bones are discovering details about how
people lived in the period 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, before they
learned to use pottery or discovered writing.
   The studies show, for example, that one villager suffered from
arthritis and another was paralyzed from the waist down. One used
his teeth excessively _ to string fishing nets, Galili believes _
while another rowed a great deal.
   At least nine other sciences associated with archaeology have
been applied to the findings, he said. ``We have studied the pollen
of flowers to learn about the climate of the period, and applied
carbon 14 tests to determine how old the site is.''
   Galili was particularly excited to discover cultivated wheat
because it helped place the village in the neolithic period, when
man, after 1.5 million years of hunting and foraging, first began
to cultivate his own food.
   ``We found several pounds of wheat and lentils,'' he said.
``Apparently a process of domestication began at this time.''
   The excavators also found remnants of wild boar and gazelle,
indicating that the villagers remained part-time hunters.
   ``The village was well-located. It was on the sea but protected
by a bay. Nearby there was a fresh stream and swamps where cattle
lived,'' Galili said. That changed as the planet became warmer,
melting glaciers and raising the sea level by up to 100 yards,
submerging the village.
   For thousands of years, sand also covered the submerged village,
hiding it and maintaining the artifacts in good condition. This
began to change 20 years ago, said Galili. ``The findings became
exposed. Man intervened in nature and upset the balance. They took
sand for construction and built breakers in the sea. The sand began
to disappear.''

<HEAD>Food Supplements: Nutritional Need Or Marketing Moves?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food supplements, which began as public health
measures, have escalated into an array of additives that some
experts say do more to satisfy marketing than nutritional needs.
   Especially in the battle for the breakfast table _ Americans
spend $5 billion a year on cereal _ vitamins and minerals have
joined the cereal maker's arsenal of eyecatching shapes, crisp
sounds and sugar coating.
   Sometimes there is a risk of giving customers too much of a good
thing, illustrated by Kellogg Co.'s recall in August of 29,000
boxes of Frosted Mini-Wheats Biscuits cereal with too much Vitamin
A. The excess was harmless, but could cause a burning sensation in
the mouth and an ``off taste.''
   The benefit or harm of additives is difficult to determine just
because they are so prevalent, said Dr. Mark Hegsted, a nutrition
professor at Harvard University School of Public Health. Studies
require control groups, and, ``We don't have populations that eat
the same things and don't have them.''
   Food producers like Kellogg say consumers look for the
supplemented foods because of lifestyle changes. Company
spokeswoman Marie T. Kitlas referred to a brochure saying cereals
are fortified to make up for skimpy, on-the-run breakfasts, and to
maintain adequate nutrition on low-calorie diets.
   Some dispute the industry claims. The New York attorney general
obtained an Aug. 4 agreement from Kellogg to stop advertising in
that state that B vitamins in Rice Krispies give consumers more
energy. Studies indicate the American diet has enough B vitamins,
and most fatigue sufferers do not have vitamin deficiencies, the
state said.
   On the other hand, no harm has been proven from additives, which
are sprayed on or dissolved into batters.
   ``In today's world, most vitamins are chemically synthesized.
But they are identical to the compounds found in nature,'' said
Allan L. Forbes, director of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's Nutrition and Food Science Division. ``There is no
difference whatsoever.''
   The FDA is preparing to impose health-claim regulations, but
those deal with prevention of degenerative ailments such as cancer
or heart disease, said Forbes. Vitamin and mineral claims usually
relate to deficiency diseases.
   Vitamin or mineral deficiencies can be found in parts of the
population, like women and teen-age girls who diet excessively, and
among poor people, but, ``If you look at the whole U.S. population
it's hard to find a deficiency,'' said University of Texas
nutrition professor Sanford Miller, a former FDA official and an
industry consultant.
   ``There is no sense adding vitamins for which there is no
deficiency,'' said Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, which raised the Rice Krispies issue and has
instituted other similar cases.
   Supplements first were added at public health officials' urging,
as an inexpensive and effective way to deal with specific problems,
Jacobson said. The federal Food and Nutrition Board endorsed
supplementing wheat flour in the early 1940s to replace thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin and iron lost in milling.
   Depression-era vagrants suffered pellagra due to niacin
deficiencies and beri beri due to thiamin deficiencies. The
supplements worked. ``You don't see pellagra in this country today.
You don't see beri beri,'' Miller said.
   Adding iodine to salt virtually eradicated goiter after it was
found that iodine in fish prevented goiter among coastal residents.
Vitamin D was added to milk to prevent rickets in children who
didn't get enough from sunshine.
   ``What is happening today is a different thing,'' Miller said.
   ``Companies are adding vitamins to more and more things,''
Jacobson said. ``They are playing on people's fears and concerns.
There is no deficiency of those vitamins whatsoever in the American
public.
   ``The sole purpose is so they can say, `Now fortified with 14
vitamins.'''
   Bruce Silverglade, the center's director of legal affairs, said
food buyers need to be educated. ``The response of the average
consumer should be, `So what, that is irrelevant to my diet.'''

<HEAD>Foreign Plants Threaten To Change The Face of Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida is under invasion by a rapidly spreading
foreign army that threatens to change its face, and even climate.
Many invaders were invited to help improve the economy or beautify
the state, then turned on their hosts.
   More than 400 foreign plant species have taken root here,
including the Australian melaleuca and Indian ficus that are
spreading alarmingly, and the Brazilian pepper tree and African
castor bean, poisonous to humans and animals.
   The danger to the Everglades is so serious that government
biologists say Florida's famous river of grass may disappear within
a lifetime.
   ``It is going to be very hard for any botanist in the future to
tell what is native and what isn't,'' says biologist Julia Morton.
``Exotic plants are multiplying and becoming so widespread they are
taking over.''
   Ironically, the most destructive species were introduced by
well-meaning experts who didn't understand the region's delicate
ecosystem. About half the 400 foreign plant species that have taken
root in Florida were imported for economic or ornamental reasons,
said Ms. Morton.
   The melaleuca tree was planted in the Everglades 80 years ago in
hopes of creating a lumber industry. Instead, the thirsty tree
soaks up water, muscles out water-dependent species not used to
competition, and the chemicals in its bark prevent all but the
hardiest birds from even landing on it.
   ``Ten years ago in the east Everglades we only found 20
melaleuca trees,'' says botanist Robert Doren of the state's Exotic
Pest Plant Council. ``Within our lifetime it could dominate the
park _ and a lifetime isn't very long.''
   The damage has economic implications. Any major change in the
Everglades will affect surrounding waters, drying up Miami's
drinking water and sabotaging the shrimp, lobster and fishing
industries in the Keys and Florida Bay.
   Some steps are being taken against the most high-profile
invaders. Crews are poisoning and cutting down the melaleuca trees,
and biologists are seeking natural enemies in Australia. But it
could be years before a safe solution is found, and meanwhile the
tree continues to spread.
   Dade County and others have adopted tough rules against planting
exotic pests, and there is widespread understanding that the
invaders are a problem.

<HEAD>New Research Reveals Side Effect of Potential High Blood Pressure
Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hormone that researchers hope may one day
help victims of high blood pressure may also contribute to abnormal
blood clotting, increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack,
scientists say.
   People with high blood pressure have higher levels of the
hormone, called atrial natriuretic factor, or ANF. They also
experience abnormally fast clotting, apparently because ANF also
appears to help blood clot faster, said Marc Taylor, a clinical
fellow in cardiology at the University of Virginia School of
Medicine in Charlottesville.
   Taylor reported his results at the 42nd Annual Conference and
Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association's Council on
High Blood Presure Research. Nearly 60 million Americans suffer
from high blood pressure, the heart association said.
   Taylor, who stressed the preliminary nature of the research,
said it is ``too soon to speculate about what this is going to mean
in the long term.''
   ``Every agent that comes along with a beneficial effect always
has its downside,'' said Taylor.
   ANF has a ``lot of possibilities'' for treating congestive heart
failure and high blood pressure, said Taylor, who still expects the
compound eventually to be marketed. Increased blood clotting, if
further research supports the preliminary finding, could be listed
as a side effect, he said.
   Abnormal clotting may contribute to heart attacks, said Taylor,
whose research revealed ANF levels twice as high in people with
high blood pressure as those with normal blood pressure.

<HEAD>Mexican-American Diabetics Run Extra Blindness Risk, Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexican-Americans with diabetes run a higher
risk of developing a potentially blinding eye disease than do
non-Hispanic whites with diabetes, a new study suggests.
   Mexican-American diabetics showed more than twice the risk of
severe retinopathy, a complication of diabetes, in a study by Texas
researchers.
   Previous work has shown that Mexican Americans also have a
three-fold greater prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes
than non-Hispanic whites do, according to the American Diabetes
Association.
   The new work compared 257 diabetic Mexican Americans living in
the San Antonio area with 56 diabetic non-Hispanic whites from
Wisconsin. Generally, the Mexican Americans had their diabetes
diagnosed at earlier ages than the other group, and they had higher
blood-sugar levels.
   Although they also tended to have lower socio-econonomic levels
than the Wisconsin group, detailed analysis showed that made no
differences in the risk of the eye disease.
   The work appears in the July issue of Diabetes, a journal of the
diabetes association.

<HEAD>Great Lakes Climate under Scrutiny at US-Canadian Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The global warming trend due to the
so-called ``greenhouse effect'' could make droughts in the U.S.
Great Lakes region more frequent, dropping lake levels and reviving
nagging questions about whether to divert lake water to parched
lands, a government spokesman said Thursday.
   For that reason, 125 U.S. and Canadian scientists meeting at the
first United States-Canada Symposium on Impacts of Climate Change
on the Great Lakes Basin recommended that the two countries start
attacking the problem of global warming now with joint scientific
study.
   ``We would like to set a tone of mutual cooperation and
understanding,'' said Alan Hecht, an organizer of the conference
and director of the National Climate Program Office in Washington,
D.C. ``We have a very good opportunity to build a constructive
relationship.''
   Pollution and gases that trap the sun's heat are blamed for the
greenhouse effect, and a finding was announced in Toronto last June
that the Earth's temperature rose one degree in the last century
because of it.
   Scientists are concerned that temperatures could rise as much as
9 more degrees Fahrenheit in the next 50 years if the trend
continues, altering weather patterns around the world as well as
lake levels and growing seasons. There is considerable
disagreement, however, over how quickly the Earth's temperature
might rise.
   Dr. F. Kenneth Hare, of Ontario's Commission of Nuclear Safety,
said if the Great Lakes region does get hotter and drier, it would
affect shipping, shoreline recreation and communities, fisheries,
agriculture, hydroelectric power, water quality and sewage
treatment operations.

<HEAD>Obese Rats May Provide Insight Into Blood Pressure-Obesity Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strain of obese rats with high blood pressure
may help researchers understand why about half of obese people have
high blood pressure.
   Obesity and high blood pressure have long been known to be
frequent partners, but researchers haven't understood why.
   ``Until now, the only way to study the connection between
obesity and hypertension in the laboratory has been to stuff
animals with food, which is not an ideal approach,'' said Dr.
Theodore Kurtz of the University of California, San Francisco.
   Kurtz and his colleagues are using the rats to investigate
whether obese people develop high blood pressure because of a
reduced sensitivity to insulin, which helps control blood sugar
levels.
   Kurtz and one of his colleagues, Dr. Harrihar Pershadsingh,
suggested earlier this year that in obese people the changes in
insulin response may affect the ability of cells to regulate levels
of calcium. Calcium levels have been shown, in turn, to be high in
blood cells of people with high blood pressure, the researchers
said.
   The rats are important in testing this hypothesis because doing
such tests in humans is difficult, the researchers said _ live
cells must be taken from blood vessel walls. In the rats, the
researchers can easily examine the blood vessel walls to see
whether they, too, have increased levels of calcium.
   Kurtz and Pershadsingh outlined their investigations in San
Francisco at the annual high blood pressure meeting of the American
Heart Association.

   A container to carry radioactive waste
to a planned long-term storage site stood up to a 30-foot drop and
being burned over 8,000 gallons of jet fuel, but needs work to keep
dust off rubber seals.
   Despite a tiny leak caused by dust working into rubber O-rings,
the container did better than expected in recent tests, said Jim
Tollison, manager of waste transportation for the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant project.
   The TRUPACT 2, a stainless steel container built like a vault
within a vault, was loaded with 14 concrete-filled 55-gallon drums,
then dropped 30 feet onto an unyielding surface three times and 40
inches onto six-inch spikes six times, as well as being burned over
jet fuel in an open pit.
   The leak was caused by concrete flaking off during the
repetitive tests and the grit working its way through a vent hole
and into the O-rings as the tanks were pressurized and
depressurized, working the seal back and forth.
   When used to ship waste, carbon filters are screwed into the
vent holes. The drums are cradled in a stainless steel vessel
inside a double-walled outer container with 10 inches of
polyurethane insulation between the walls. The outer container is
designed to act like shock-absorbing bumpers on cars.
   The lids of both the inner and outer containers are sealed with
O-rings that are four-tenths of an inch thick and six feet in
diameter, made of butyl rubber like that used in car tires. The
O-rings sit in a groove, or channel.
   The grit wore a channel that let the inner container leak,
though the outer container did not, Tollison said. ``We'll have to
put a dust seal in place, just like weatherstripping,'' even though
the waste wouldn't cause dust.
   ``The package has done an excellent job of protecting the
contents,'' Tollison said last month after tests at Sandia National
Laboratories. ``This package would not have leaked and contaminated
the environment.''
   TRUPACT stands for Transuranic Packaging Transporter.
Transuranic waste, a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, is
radioactive and hazardous. The DOE plans to put 125,000 barrels of
it in a repository excavated from ancient salt beds 2,150 feet
underground near Carlsbad. It says WIPP could be ready to accept
waste next year for a five-year test.

<TEXT>
   Turner Network Television, a hybrid of cable and
network programming, hits the airwaves today in a broadcasting
venture that will serve as a vehicle for Atlanta media magnate Ted
Turner's collection of classic movies.
   Viewers who tune in for TNT's debut will see Vivien Leigh as
Scarlett O'Hara in ``Gone With The Wind,'' the MGM classic which is
the cornerstone of Turner's collection.
   Muppet creator Jim Henson's popular ``Fraggle Rock'' show moves
from Home Box Office to TNT Tuesday. ``The Muppet Show,'' with Miss
Piggy and Kermit the Frog, will follow that afternoon and Henson
has signed on for other projects.
   The 24-hour network will initially make liberal use of cartoons
in the daytime and movies at night, but Turner promises one major
project a week by 1991. Already scheduled are made-for-TNT movies
starring Martin Sheen and son Emilio Estevez, Farrah Fawcett and
Oscar-winners Charlton Heston and Faye Dunaway.
   Turner, owner of Cable News Network and CNN Headline News, also
promises to bid on major award shows, sporting events including the
Olympics and major league baseball, and other showcase programs.
   Turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get TNT
initially. TNT spokeswoman Allison Berry said early projections had
TNT in 30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990, but the
increase in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989.
   ``It's far less important what they launch with than how quickly
they get into 30 million homes,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst
with Kagan and Associates in Carmel, Calif.
   ``I think they need to reach 30 million within ... 18 to 24
months to keep to their business plan, and actually they'd like to
do it sooner than that.''
   The network said it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for the
first three years into original programming, and Turner himself
told cable company executives in Atlanta for a trade show that the
network would lose $40 million before breaking even.
   ``If we didn't have the MGM library, and the RKO and Warner
libraries, we never could have started the networks, and that was a
billion and a half dollar investment,'' Turner said.
   Turner acquired more than 3,000 films when he purchased MGM-UA
Entertainment Co., then sold all but the films to pay for the
transaction.
   The deal left Turner saddled with $1.4 billion of debt, and
raised doubts about whether he could survive. That debt has since
been refinanced, and large cable companies have bought interest in
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., gaining seats on the board of
directors and say-so over large financial decisions.
   One of the keys to the success of TNT, is the acceptance by
cable systems, whose limited channel space already is overwhelmed,
according to Gerbrandt
   ``I think the general sense in the industry is that (TNT) is an
idea whose time has come, (but) he's launching it at a time when
channel capacity is not exactly abundant,'' Gerbrandt said.

<HEAD>After Deere Settlement Labor Talks Focus On Caterpillar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A contract settlement between Deere & Co.
and the United Auto Workers will likely serve as a pattern for
future talks between the UAW and Caterpillar Inc., a union
spokesman says.
   The tentative agreement reached Saturday averted a threatened
strike by more than 13,000 employees at Deere, the nation's leading
farm-machinery manufacturer. Details of the pact weren't released.
   As the Deere talks reached their final hours, negotiators for
Caterpillar and the UAW in Bridgeton, Mo., agreed Friday to extend
their contract indefinitely and recess talks pending the outcome of
Deere bargaining.
   ``Until the pact with Deere and the UAW is ratified, I wouldn't
expect to see any change in our status,'' Caterpillar spokesman
Mark Polzin said.
   Caterpillar talks had muddled along for two months before the
parallel negotiations with Deere resulted in a tentative contract.
   Deere was chosen as the target for a settlement or strike
because union officials believed they had a better opportunity for
contract gains there.
   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator in the Caterpillar
talks, said the union likely would use the Deere contract as a
pattern for future talks with Caterpillar.
   Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving
equipment, with 58,800 employees, could face renewed union demands
for job security, a reduction in overtime, call-back of 1,000 UAW
members on layoff and the first merit pay increase in a decade.
   The union reportedly has been seeking a three-year pact and a 3
percent wage increase in each year.
   Caterpillar wants to hold down costs and is seeking more
flexibility in job assignments and scheduling, and wants to
restrict employee mobility and save money on retraining.
   If talks break down, either side can terminate the contract with
five days' notice and Caterpillar could face a strike by 17,500
blue-collar workers at plants in 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa,
Pennsylvania, Colorado and Tennesse.

   Iraqi oil minister Issam Abdulrahim
Al-Chalabi met with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Hisham Nazer, on
Monday to discuss stabilizing the world oil market.
   Chalabi told the official Saudi press agency SPA after the brief
meeting that the talks were ``useful.''
   SPA quoted the Iraqi minister as reaffirming his country's
support for a joint meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring and
long-term strategy committees to control oil production and boost
prices.
   A joint meeting of the two committees has been called for later
this month.
   Iraq is one of several member states of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries producing above the quota set by the
cartel. Iraq has stressed its need for higher oil revenues to help
finance reconstruction schemes following its 8-year-old war with
Iran.
   Chalabi recently has visited the other Gulf Arab states that are
members of OPEC, including Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter in the 13-nation cartel.

<HEAD>Scherer to Explore Sale, Other Alternatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.P. Scherer Corp.'s board said today it is
exploring the sale of the gelatin capsule company, marking victory
for a group of dissident shareholders led by the founder's daughter.
   In a brief statement, Scherer said it has hired the investment
firm Goldman Sachs & Co. to ``analyze alternatives which might
include a recapitalization, business combination, management-led
buyout or approaching third parties on the potential sale of all or
part of the company.''
   Karla Scherer Fink, Scherer's largest shareholder and daughter
of the company's late founder, sparked the battle months ago by
pressing her contention that the company be sold.
   Heading the opposition was Peter Fink, the company's president
and chief executive officer and Fink's estranged husband.
   Suits and countersuits have been filed during the past few
months as the two factions struggled to gain control of the
company. Mrs. Fink and her brother, John Scherer, waged a
successful proxy fight at the company's annual meeting in August
that resulted in the ouster of at least one director who opposed
their plan to sell the company.
   The dissident group also was successful in blocking several
management stock-option proposals. Mrs. Fink controls about 33
percent of the company.
   According to today's editions of The Wall Street Journal, Fink
changed his position on the sale after losing the support of other
directors who were swayed by the proxy victories and other factors.
   In a statement, Fink said the hiring of Goldman Sachs doesn't
guarantee that the company will be sold, but Scherer directors will
consider information the firm develops at their next meeting, set
for Oct. 25.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs totaled
918 this week week, one higher than the previous week, Baker Hughes
Inc. reported Monday.
   Last week's total of 917 was the lowest since the count reached
894 on Aug. 1, and appears to reflect continuing softness in the
crude market, said Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge.
   The number of working rigs a year ago was 1,127.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count also declined, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma had six fewer working
rigs, followed by Texas, three; New Mexico, two; and California and
Louisiana, one each.
   Kansas was the biggest gainer for the week with an increase in
eight working rigs, followed by Colorado, five; Wyoming and
Pennsylvania, three each; Michigan, two; and North Dakota and Ohio,
one each.

   Soybean futures prices dipped while grains
advanced slightly today in early trading at the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Wheat and corn prices received a boost from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's report on grain stocks released after the close of
trading on Friday. The report showed slightly lower-than-expected
quantities for both grains.
   Buying also was sparked by speculation that China may make a
major purchase of U.S. wheat and the Soviet Union might sign a
long-term grain agreement with the United States, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybean prices were pressured by the USDA report showing
slightly higher-than-expected quantities, and by anticipation of
good harvesting weather this week, Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.17 a bushel; corn was }
cent lower to 1} cents higher, with December at $2.87{ a bushel;
oats were 1} cent to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.44 a

November at $8.12{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork complex prices opened
sharply lower at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .05 cent lower to .15 cent

   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley today
told automakers they must achieve an average fuel economy of 26.5
miles per gallon for 1989-model cars _ higher than required this
year but less than mandated under a law Burnley has the power to
change.
   He said his action, cutting 1.0 mpg off the standard Congress
told manufacturers to meet for 1989 models, was designed to help
the U.S. auto industry compete abroad.
   Each automaker is required to post an average fuel economy of at
least 26.0 mpg for all of its 1988 models. That has been the
standard for the last three model years.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. had said they could not
meet the 27.5-mpg standard without significant layoffs.
   Burnley, making the announcement this morning, said:
   ``A standard of 27.5 mpg for model year 1989 would have clearly
put our domestic full-line manufacturers at a competitive
disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers, especially the
Asians, who have been building only small cars and can easily meet
the fuel economy requirements,''
   Arrayed against the automakers in public hearings last month
were a number of public issues groups, which sought even stricter
fuel-economy standards for reasons ranging from conserving gasoline
to reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.
   The fuel-economy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices.
   The law set a goal of 27.5 mpg beginning in 1985 but allowed the
Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, to alter the standard.
   It was that provision that enabled the department to set the
standard at 26.0 mpg beginning in 1986 and at 26.5 mpg for the 1989
model year.
   Both GM and Ford had said a 27.5 mpg standard would have caused
layoffs at their auto plants because they would have had to cut
back on production of larger, less fuel-efficient cars.
   Ultimately, the job losses to the auto industry and its
suppliers would have numbered in the hundreds of thousands, GM and
Ford said.
   GM said Burnley's decision ``was in the best interest of
American workers and consumer choice'' and called the 1975 law
``outdated.''
   Ford said the agency's decision ``recognizes that consumer
preferences resulting from low fuel prices have placed a
particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 27.5
mpg standard.''
   Chrysler Corp. said it would exceed a 27.5 mpg standard and
complained that ``a meaningful gasoline tax would eliminate the
need for a CAFE-like regulatory system.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has taken the position that his
company has successfully met the fuel-economy level set by Congress
and federal regulators should not change the rules to help
companies that have been less successful in making fuel-efficient
cars.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds with
the automakers and their regulators, said it intends to file a
lawsuit seeking to force NHTSA to allow the standard to return to
27.5 mpg.
   Burnley's decision ``is another cave-in by the Reagan
administration,'' said Clarence Ditlow, the center's director. ``It
is going to cost U.S. jobs as GM and Ford continue to make small
cars abroad.''

<HEAD>Court Declines to Hear Case of Nuclear Plant Owner in South
Carolina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to order the
government to compensate the owner of a nuclear fuel reprocessing
plant that was denied an operating license as a result of a Carter
administration decision on curbing international nuclear
proliferation.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the Barnwell,
S.C., plant's owner who says that a changed federal policy cost the
facility more than $200 million.
   The justices also turned down a related appeal by a company that
signed a contract to transport nuclear fuel to and from Barnwell.
   A federal appeals court in Washington, calling the plant ``one
of the most remarkable white elephants'' in the nation's history,
ruled in February that plant owner Allied-General Nuclear Services
is not entitled to compensation.
   The plant was denied a license in 1977 when former President
Jimmy Carter decided to defer indefinitely the recycling of
plutonium for nuclear power.
   The appeals court said the abandonment of reprocessing was
intended to bolster the nation's credibility in discouraging
plutonium production abroad.
   Even though President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, there has
been no move by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license the
Barnwell facility.
   ``Most of it stands there, empty and forlorn,'' the appeals
court said.
   The appeals court rejected Allied-General's claim that it should
be compensated because government inducements prompted the company
to build the plant.
   The government provided the land for the facility and urged the
company to build it, the owners said. They said denying the plant
permission to operate, in effect, was the same as a government
seizure of the property without constitutionally required just
compensation.
   But the appeals court said: ``No one has a legally protected
right to use property in a manner that is injurious to the safety
of the general public.
   ``There can be no doubt that President Carter considered nuclear
proliferation was a threat ... and that consequently the processing
of spent fuel at the Barnwell plant was a danger he must avert,''
the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also ruled against NL Industries Inc., which
said it invested more than $15 million in transportation systems
for the Barnwell facility.
   NL Industries signed a contract with Allied-General in 1971 to
provide rail and truck service, depots and other facilities to
carry nuclear fuel to and from Barnwell.
   NL Industries said the government ``ratified the contract'' and
was ``intimately involved in the development'' of the
transportation system.
   The cases are Allied-General vs. U.S., 87-1902, and NL
Industries vs. U.S., 87-1922.

   The Kuwait Investment Office, the London-based
investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, said Monday it holds a
5.1 percent stake in Midland Bank PLC.
   In a statement lodged with London's Stock Exchange, the Kuwait
Investment Office, which also holds a stake of about 20 percent in
British Petroleum Co. PLC, said it bought 1.5 million Midland
shares on Friday. That lifted its holding to 28.04 million shares,
or above 5 percent, requiring it to divulge the stake.
   Midland shares rose on the news. The shares, which had been down
about 9 pence (15 cents), were down 6 pence (10 cents) at 415 pence
($7.01) after the announcement.
   An official at Midland Bank, who wasn't identified, in
accordance with British practice, said he had been aware of the
stake for over a year, and that it appears to be just an investment.
   ``We are pleased that someone thinks we are a good investment,''
he added. ``It's as casual as that.''
   An official at the Kuwait Investment Office, who wasn't
identified for the same reason, declined to comment.
   Other major shareholders in Midland include Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp. with 14.9 percent; M and G Group PLC, an
investment management group, with about 7 percent; and British
conglomerate Hanson PLC with about 5 percent.

   One building juts up like an abstractly
whittled chopstick. The other looks like a stack of bridges.
   Two new bank buildings in Hong Kong are striking architectural
testimonies to the future beyond the return of the British colony
to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The taller building, recently topped out at 70 stories, will be
completed next spring to house the Hong Kong office of the Bank of
China, the international banking arm of Communist China.
   The fifth tallest building in the world and the tallest in Asia,
it towers above its neighbors as a symbol, some say, of Beijing's
impending dominance of this free-wheeling world trade center.
   Two blocks east is the ultra-modern glass and aluminum main
office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., commonly called
the Hongkong Bank, a publicly held corporation that is the colony's
leading commercial bank. It also has some central-bank functions
and owns subsidiary banks and stock-dealing firms around the world.
   A radical-looking, 52-level structure, the Hongkong Bank
building was completed in 1985 with a whopping 5.227 billion Hong
Kong dollars ($670 million) spent on its construction and
furnishings, the bank says.
   If the powerful corporation, which has offices in over 50
countries, had put its money elsewhere, it probably would have
shaken confidence in Hong Kong's future as a capitalist haven.
   In 1997 China retakes sovereignty over Hong Kong and its 5.5
million people. Under an agreement between Britain and China the
territory is to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and retain its
capitalist system for 50 years, but doubts about whether the
agreement will hold up have led to an increase in emigration and a
general nervousness about the future of capitalism.
   Michael Broadbent, spokesman and external relations manager of
the Hongkong Bank, said the building was put up ``because we needed
a new building, not because of Hong Kong's future.''
   ``But people did say that if the Hongkong Bank is prepared to
spend so much, it must be confident in the future of Hong Kong,''
Broadbent said.
   ``That is perfectly true. We do have confidence in Hong Kong's
future.''
   The Bank of China building, though taller than the Hongkong Bank
headquarters, may end up costing less. The land for the Bank of
China building cost 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($128 million) and
the construction cost is set at 1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars.
   Though the two banks compete in some areas, people associated
with the two buildings aren't throwing stones at each other's costs
or architecture. Broadbent, of the Hongkong Bank, said he greatly
admired the Bank of China's new building. Kellogg Wong, associate
partner in the New York-based I.M. Pei architectural firm that
designed the Bank of China building, has been equally gracious in
his praise of the Hongkong Bank building.
   The Hongkong Bank was designed by the British architect Norman
Foster. The building, more than 585 feet high, has such unusual
features as a sun-scoop across the south side to reflect light into
a 170-foot-high interior atrium; bridge-like trusses at five levels
across the width of the building on which the weight is suspended;
a completely open floor plan; 62 escalators, a claimed world record
for one building; and prefabricated modules on the ends of each
floor containing toilet and service facilities.
   The building was planned to be flexible, and staffers say such
costly features as movable floor panels made from the same material
as aircraft flooring have already paid off by making it possible to
move a whole department in a weekend at low cost.
   The Bank of China building, by contrast, surges up from a base
tier 170 feet square and 170 feet tall, making the first tier a
cube. At that level three-quarters of the cube continues to rise,
and at higher tiers the building becomes abruptly narrower up to
the prism-shaped top, 1,220 feet high. Triangular trusses and
upward-pointing angles are the main visible features.
   ``It's not surprising that the building makes a very strong
structural statement,'' said Wong.
   Leslie Robertson, head of a New York structural engineering firm
that now counts the Bank of China as well as the two World Trade
Center towers in New York among its super-tall clients, said the
building was destined to become ``a new symbol for Hong Kong.''
   But for the Japan-based Kumagai Gumi construction company, which
is doing much of the building work, the Bank of China is likely to
be a money loser.
   By contract the company will receive 1.1 billion Hong Kong
dollars for its work, said Martin Hadaway, project director for
Kumagai Gumi, but costs have escalated above that with the rise in
the Japanese yen and other factors.
   Asked how much Kumagai Gumi would lose, Hadaway replied, ``I
don't know ... But if you take the long-term view, your reputation
in Hong Kong and China will more than cover the loss eventually.''

<HEAD>Organic Grapes and `Environmental Capitalism'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-owner of the world's largest
organic grape vineyard attributes his success and longevity to an
unusual blend of philosophies he terms ``environmental capitalism.''
   ``That's really what it is. It's taking the good that goes on in
the world and making a few dollars off of it. And why not?'' said
Steve Pavich, 39, who oversees the Richgrove, Calif.-based Pavich
and Sons vineyards.
   The sheer size of the operation _ 1,400 acres in California and
Arizona _ is unusual in organic farming circles. Most organic
vineyards range from 40 to 200 acres, said Bob Scrowcroft,
executive director of the California Certified Organic Growers
Association.
   ``Most organic growers will say the Paviches are 10 years ahead
of everybody in growing techniques and marketing,'' said Joyce
Johnson, director of the Kern County Valley Action Network, an
environmental group.
   Although Pavich is dedicated to organic farming techniques, he
doesn't condemn other growers who use pesticides.
   ``I'm not telling any other growers that they have to stop using
pesticides. I say if they need to do it to survive, that's what
they need to do,'' he said.
   Organic farming is an agricultural practice that does not rely
on the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. In California,
growers marketing their produce under the organic association's
label are subject to strict guidelines on fertilization and pest
control.
   The guidelines are designed to separate the truly organic
produce from other goods advertised as ``natural'' or
``pesticide-free.''
   Pavich never uses herbicides or commercial fertilizers but has
used what he calls ``biologically acceptable'' insecticides. The
Pavich ranches haven't sprayed at all during the past four years.
   ``We're at the top end of the transition now. It took us from
1971 to 1981 _ 10 years _ to figure out all of the parameters we
are working with today,'' Pavich said. ``At that time we had about
one-tenth of the materials we have today and had to set up much of
that myself.''
   Information on organic farming techniques was hard to come by
when Pavich began farming 750 acres in 1971.
   ``There is no place where you can have it handed to you on a
silver platter,'' Pavich said.
   But the subsequent years of research, field testing and
trial-and-error was ``a long and hard process.''
   Pavich reluctantly offered a few details about his techniques,
which he said took 17 years to perfect and would be in great demand
in the highly competitive field.
   ``Most of it has to do with timing,'' he said. ``When you are in
tune with that rhythm of what nature is doing, then it's much
easier to deal with the problems.''
   At first, Pavich spent twice as much money on various organic
fertilizing techniques than a conventional farm would spend on
synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Now he estimates his fertilizing
costs are about the same as a vineyard using commercial fertilizers.
   Pavich and his brother, Tom, 32, accomplished that by planting a
wide variety of cover crops and using manure fertilizers and gypsum
to keep the soil productive, reduce erosion and hold down the costs
of pest control.
   Yields on the Pavich ranches are in line with industry averages
_ production now totals 1 million boxes annually.
   For example, Pavich says his vineyards in Richgrove produce
about 650 lugs of Thompson seedless grapes per acre. The California
Table Grape Commission says average Thompson harvest is 600 lugs
per acre. With this year's bumper crop, however, some growers are
harvesting up to 900 lugs an acre, said commission President Bruce
Obbink.
   A lug is a box containing about 23 pounds of grapes.
   Some Pavich grapes can fetch a 10 to 15 percent premium because
they are organic, but the price usually is in line with the market.
   Like other organic growers, Pavich is frustrated by what he
considers a dearth of research on sustainable farming techniques _
in contrast to the vigorous marketing by agricultural chemical
companies.
   But universities are warming up to sustainable agriculture
research, he feels.
   Ironically, Pavich and other organic table grape growers have
been caught in the crossfire of the United Farm Workers boycott to
protest use of five pesticides on table grapes.
   The union has issued conflicting statements about how the
boycott applies to organically grown produce.
   Like other grape growers, Pavich says the boycott hasn't
affected sales, but he's had to devote time to defending the
integrity of his organic crop when UFW pickets demand removal of
his grapes from stores across the country.
   ``They put a question in a lot of peoples' minds, and we have to
answer those,'' he said.
   Scrowcroft said the recent surge of attention to the UFW boycott
has ignored what organic activists consider a solution to the
problem of worker pesticide poisonings and consumer anxiety over
food safety: organic growing.
   ``Nobody has identified the positive out there. That positive is
certified organic food,'' he said.

   More than 2,000 Hollywood drivers went on
strike today after a weekend of negotiations with producers failed
to avert the entertainment industry's second walkout this year, an
official said.
   ``We're going to be out a while, I'm sure of that,'' Earl Bush,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 399, said after talks broke
off at 1:40 a.m. ``They want us to strike. They want us to break
the union as far as I'm concerned.''
   Members of the electricians, laborers and plasterers unions also
have authorized strikes today against the producers, said Bush, who
estimated the number of workers on strike will total 3,300 to
3,500. There was no immediate answer at the offices of the other
three unions.
   The Hollywood plumbers union, the smallest of five crafts
unions, announced last week it would not strike.
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for television and film producers,
had said previously that the strike by the 2,200 Teamsters would
not cripple the film and television industry. Hollywood is just
beginning to return to full speed following the 22-week strike by
the Writers Guild of America that ended in August.
   Under their contracts, the writers and members of other talent
unions such as actors and directors cannot honor picket lines set
up by craft unions such as the Teamsters.
   Bush said the Teamsters made several concessions, but they were
all rejected by the producers. Strikers targeted two sites for
picketing today: the Santa Monica Pier, where NBC's ``Hunter'' is
being filmed, and at the Hollywood office of the show's producer,
Stephen J. Cannell. About two dozen pickets arrived outside the
office shortly after 5:30 a.m.
   Teamster driver Clyde Lucas said he didn't find out about the
strike until he arrived for work early today at the Paramount
Studios. ``I assumed we were going to work,'' Lucas said. ``But
when I arrived at the studios, there was a lockout.''
   Federally mediated talks began Friday morning following
Thursday's announcement that the union had voted 1,441-196 to
reject what the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
said was their last contract offer.
   Both sides remained at the bargaining table for a series of
talks during the weekend at the alliance's headquarters in suburban
Sherman Oaks. Sunday's session, which began at 5 p.m., lasted more
than eight hours, Bush said.
   Bush has called the producers' offer ``the worst contract offer
ever made to a union.''
   The drivers are responsible for transporting everything from
stars to equipment and props to and from the sets, said union
spokesman Mike Shepherd.
   Key issues dividing the two sides include overtime rules,
salaries and guidelines for the making of non-union films. Some
Teamster drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61 to
$14 per hour.
   ``We'll strike until we can get a settlement we can live with,''
Bush said following the vote.
   The producers have said their terms are final and there is no
room for further negotiations. They contend the pay cuts are
necessary if production costs in Hollywood are to remain
competitive.
   ``We have trained drivers and we're ready to continue production
under any circumstances,'' Steinberg said previously. ``I don't
think it will have any impact on production. The studios are very
well prepared.''

<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium set up to
build a 31-mile rail tunnel linking Britain and France, said Monday
the project would cost about $500 million more than previously
forecast but that its May 1993 completion date remained unchanged.
   The consortium said it revised its total cost estimate upward by
6 percent to 5.2 billion pounds, the equivalent of $8.8 billion,
from an originally projected 4.9 billion pounds, or $8.3 billion.
   Eurotunnel had said in August that drilling on the tunnel was
well behind schedule. The consortium said Monday it was confident
it could make up for lost time.
   Some 229 million pounds have been spent on the project in the
six months ending June 30, officials said.
   Of the total forecasted costs, Eurotunnel said 3.7 billion
pounds would go to construction, project management and corporate
costs, 1 billion pounds toward financing costs, and 530 million
pounds toward a provision for inflation.

<HEAD>A New Era in Stocks or an Old One Returned?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is it really a new era in the stock market?
   You might think so as you listen to your broker explain that
there is a return to quality stocks, a de-emphasis on day-to-day
events in favor of long-term trends, a desire for sensible rather
than outrageous profits.
   It is market of investors, they say, rather than of traders. It
is one in which people examine price-earnings ratios, dividend
yields and other measures of value. It is a market of aware,
knowledgeable investors, they say.
   It is a market in which people examine basic values and are
ready to wait patiently for profits to be realized. It contrasts
with the old market of in-and-out trading, tips, hunches, and
overnight profits _ or losses.
   But is it a new era? Hardly.
   More accurately, it is the forced abandonment of an aberrant
period in which it might be argued that a large segment of the
financial community itself abandoned securities as investments, and
promoted casino chips instead.
   A new attitude does indeed seem to pervade financial markets,
forced upon them in part by the wrenching collapse of Oct. 19,
1987. But there is nothing new in a retreat to old values; it
happens every time.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., among those brokerage houses
prominently observing the anniversary of the crash, writes this
analytical obituary:
   ``A national impatience has gripped our financial lives; we are
swayed by the latest trade deficit number one day, the latest
inflation forecast the next.
   ``What has been lost is a sense of perspective and of
proportion, an understanding of investing as a long-term economic
process rather than a series of short-term events or reactions to
events.''
   In its anniversary promotion, Merrill Lynch & Co., tells
Americans that it ``assumed a leadership role before, during, and
after the severe market decline in helping to service its customers
and prevent short-term panic.''
   Its performance before the fall, says Merrill Lynch, ``was not
only exemplary, but fortuitous.''
   Such year-after observances, however, conceivably could provoke
more questions than praise. Such as:
   _Who lost perspective and a sense of proportion? Was it the
American public, or dice-tossing traders and even members of the
financial community?
   _Who promoted short-term trading in favor of long-term
investing? Was it small investors, or was it the financial
institutions, including brokerage houses and their sales people?
   Searching for reasons why the stock market debacle was isolated
from the economy in general, researchers at the University of
Michigan examined data on how Americans used their money. One
reason: Relatively few own stocks directly.
   And that brings up the biggest question of all, one asked
repeatedly and still not fully answered:
   Was the stock market crash a consequence of short-term trading
in its various forms, of an emphasis on price rather than value, of
a fever generated by all those institutions and parties that could
benefit from volatility?
   That is, was it merely a phenomenon of the financial marketplace
rather than of the entire economy?

   United Parcel Service announced that it has
expanded its international air delivery network to 19 new countries
in Europe and the Far East.
   UPS said Monday that it now is able to provide scheduled
delivery of packages and documents to and from every address in 40
countries and 57 cities in China. Delivery usually takes two to
four days to most points, but the company is aiming for overnight
service, said Senior Vice President John W. Alden.
   UPS, a privately owned company based in Greenwich, Conn., calls
itself the world's largest package delivery company. It currently
ships 10.5 million packages a day worldwide, the bulk of them in
the United States.
   UPS also announced that, as part of the expansion, it has
acquired for an undisclosed sum Asian Courier System, which
operates in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
   Rates for the international service include customs fees, Alden
told a news conference in New York. He said UPS' computers can hook
up directly with those of customs services in different countries.
   It costs $22 to send a letter overseas with the service, while
the cost of a package ranges from $32 to $246, depending on weight.

asbestos products.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the bankruptcy reorganization of Manville Corp., a building
materials manufacturer that once produced asbestos products.
   The court, without comment, denied an appeal by a company that
distributed asbestos made by Manville, which changed its name in
1981 from Johns-Manville Corp.
   The distributor, MacArthur Co., said the bankruptcy proceedings
unfairly denied it adequate financial protection.
   Manville filed a bankruptcy petition in 1982 designed to protect
it against potential liability of more than $2 billion in suits by
people suffering asbestos-related injuries.
   Between 1984 and 1986, Manville reached a settlement with its
insurance companies. The insurers agreed to pay the company $770
million in return for assurances they would not face additional
claims.
   The insurance settlement, a cornerstone of Manville's bankruptcy
reorganization, was approved by a federal bankruptcy judge.
   The MacArthur company said the judge's order is valid only if it
extends protection to MacArthur against suits by asbestos victims.
   MacArthur said it has been forced to accept the burden of suits
by asbestos victims without the protection of insurance coverage to
which it is entitled.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January ruled
against MacArthur.
   The appeals court said if the company has any valid claim
against the insurers, its remedy is to seek money from the $770
million settlement fund created by the insurance firms.
   ``It may well be that MacArthur would prefer to assert its
interest in Manville's property in a proceeding other than in the
bankruptcy court, but such a result is not required by the
bankruptcy law,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is MacArthur Co. vs. Johns-Manville, 87-2082.

   Stock prices fell in light trading today,
starting off the final quarter of 1988 on a wary note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.40 on Friday,
dropped 21.52 to 2,091.29 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 359 up, 1,079 down and
414 unchanged.
   Wall Streeters were generally resigning themselves to a sluggish
week, expecting investors to back away from stocks before the
government issues its monthly report Friday on the employment
situation.
   Analysts look for the data to show a pickup in payroll
employment growth for September after relatively modest increases
in July and August.
   If those estimates prove correct, it would come as a setback to
hopes that the economy was slowing to a pace that would satisfy the
Federal Reserve, which is seeking to keep inflation from heating up.
   The Commerce Department reported today that new factory orders
rose 3.1 percent in August.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down | at 44[;
International Business Machines, down 1 at 114]; American Telephone
& Telegraph, down \ at 25}, and Coca-Cola, down 1[ at 42|.
   Technology issues were notably weak. Digital Equipment fell 1{
to 92], and Hewlett-Packard 1 to 48~, while in the over-the-counter
market Intel lost 1} to 25} and Apple Computer was down 1\ at 42.
   Middle South Utilities bucked the downtrend, rising [ to 15[ in
active trading. On Friday the company declared its first
common-stock dividend in three years.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.22 to 152.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.97 at 299.66.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 88.55 million shares with two

<HEAD>Dollar Drifts Lower; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar drifted lower in thin European
trading Monday under the spectre of central bank intervention
raised by West Germany's top central banker.
   Gold prices rose.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, was
quoted in a newspaper interview over the weekend as saying that
further weakening of the West German mark ``can't be desirable.''
   The statement implied that the central bank would intervene on
foreign exchange markets to take the steam out of any steep rise in
the U.S. currency, dealers said.
   Frustration over failed attempts to take the dollar higher led
to lackluster selling Monday, one London dealer said.
   ``People are so fed up with the possibility of central bank
intervention on the upside that it's easier to give the dollar a
push lower,'' said Roger Allen, corporate dealer at EBC Amro Bank
in London.
   Dealers in London and Frankfurt predicted the dollar will wander
lower throughout the week until it picks up support at about 1.85
marks. They expect little market-affecting news until the release
Friday of U.S. employment figures for September.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 133.90 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 133.80 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6990 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6905 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates included: 1.8608 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5785
Swiss francs, down from 1.5830; 6.3350 French francs, down from
6.3700; 2.1010 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1185; 1,397.95 Italian
lire, up from 1,396.50; and 1.2104 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2171.
   Gold prices rebounded in Europe based on short-covering, the
buying of gold to fulfill agreements to sell it, Zurich dealers
said. But they predicted lower oil prices will continue to dim
fears of inflation and depress the value of bullion.
   Gold climbed more than $3 per troy ounce in London to a late bid
price of $397.75, compared with late Friday's $394.45.
   In Zurich, gold rose marginally higher, closing at a bid $397
compared with $396 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.31 to close at a bid $397.91
per ounce.
   Silver bullion prices edged higher on the London market where
the metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.22 a troy ounce,
compared with Friday's $6.14.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange fell
sharply Monday to close at the day's lowest point, as a negative
start to Wall Street and concerns over slumping oil prices
depressed a thin market.
   Dealers said declines in prices and volume reflected renewed
skittish sentiment in contrast to last week's enthusiasm over a
better-than-expected British trade report for August and takeover
speculation.
   ``Cold water has been poured on the market and any advance has
been stopped dead in its tracks,'' one dealer said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 23.9
points, or 1.3 percent, lower at 1,802.6, its worst level for the
day.
   The index moved in negative territory all session, and at its
best level, at midmorning, it showed a loss of 9.1 points.
   Volume was modest, as just 336.6 million shares changed hands,
compared with 550.1 million shares traded Friday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 25.43 points at
2,087.48 as London trading subsided.
   Several dealers said Wall Street's slide came on the heels of
talk in New York that a major U.S. brokerage issued a strongly
worded recommendation for clients to switch out of equities.
   The sagging price of crude oil took its toll on market
sentiment, some said.
   ``It might have absolutely horrendous implications'' for
Britain's trade balance, one market maker said. The country is the
world's fifth-largest oil producer.

   A unit of The Carlyle Group, L.P. has
purchased almost 10 percent of Fairchild Industries Inc.'s common
stock for about $16.8 million, according to documents filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The Carlyle Group, a Washington-based private merchant banking
and investment firm, stated in its SEC filing that it was exploring
the possibility of acquiring all of the outstanding common stock of
Fairchild in a friendly transaction.
   The filing stated that the deal ``is not opposed by a majority
of the members of the company's board of directors.''
   Fairchild board chairman Emanuel Fthenakis said Monday the
company is evaluating the Schedule 13D filing and the investors.
   Fthenakis noted that the company historically has attracted
investors who are interested in Fairchild's long-term value, rather
than short-term profit-taking.
   Carlyle stated it believed any transactions could be financed
under current market conditions. No agreement, however, has been
reached with the banks, the investors said.
   According to the filing, the partnership holds more than 1.4
million shares of stock in the Chantilly, Va.-based defense
electronics and industrial parts company.
   All of the stock was purchased since July 25 at prices ranging
from $9.96 to $11 per share, Carlyle said.
   Several telephone conversations between Carlyle and Fthenakis
have been held, but no meeting has been scheduled.
   Fairchild reported second quarter profits of $10.2 million on
revenues of $132 million.

   Grains futures prices were mostly higher while
soybean prices were mixed Monday as traders at the Chicago Board of
Trade took their cues from U.S. Department of Agriculture reports.
   ``Wheat and corn benefited from Friday's (USDA) quarterly stocks
report, which showed a little less corn and wheat ... than
expected,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Speculation that China may be on the verge of making a
substantial purchase of U.S. wheat, and that the Soviet Union may
be preparing to sign a long-term grain agreement with the United
States also fueled buying, he said.
   Corn traders received another bullish signal from the USDA's
quarterly report released after the close of trading Friday showing
larger-than-expected numbers of pigs expected to be born in coming
months, Lespinasse said. Corn is a major food source for pigs.
   The soy complex, especially soybean meal _ another important
feed for pigs _ also gained some support from the pig report, as
well as from the strength in the wheat and bean pits, Lespinasse
said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 5} cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.20\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to 4{ cents higher with December at $2.90\ a bushel;
oats were 3\ cents to 6\ cents higher, with December at $2.47} a
bushel; and soybeans were 8{ cents lower to 7 cents higher, with
November at $8.20 a bushel.

   Stock prices lost ground in light trading today,
starting off the final quarter of 1988 on a wary note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.40 on Friday,
dropped 17.25 to 2,095.66 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 389 up,
1,107 down and 397 unchanged.
   Wall Streeters were generally resigning themselves to a sluggish
week, expecting investors to back away from stocks before the
government issues its monthly report Friday on the employment
situation.
   Analysts look for the data to show a pickup in payroll
employment growth for September after relatively modest increases
in July and August.
   If those estimates prove correct, it would come as a setback to
hopes that the economy was slowing to a pace that would satisfy the
Federal Reserve, which is seeking to keep inflation from heating up.
   The Commerce Department reported today that new factory orders
rose 3.1 percent in August.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down { at 44\;
International Business Machines, down ~ at 114{; American Telephone
& Telegraph, down [ at 25~, and Coca-Cola, down 1 at 42}.
   Technology issues were notably weak. Digital Equipment fell 1\

market Intel lost 1{ to 26 and Apple Computer was down 1\ at 42.
   Middle South Utilities bucked the downtrend, rising [ to 15[ in

dropped 1.12 to 152.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

<HEAD>WPPSS Bond Buyers Lose Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court closed a chapter Monday in
the largest municipal bond default in U.S. history, dismissing
claims by investors who lost money from the Washington Public Power
Supply System's doomed nuclear power project.
   The court let stand a ruling that dismissed some key investor
claims triggered by the $2.25 billion bond default. It also
rejected an appeal by the bond counsel in the case seeking
additional legal protection.
   Meanwhile, Manville Corp. was given the go-ahead to emerge from
six years of federal bankruptcy court protection after the justices
rejected a challenge to the reorganization of the Denver-based
building materials company.
   Manville filed a bankruptcy petition in 1982 to protect itself
against potential liability of more than $2 billion in suits by
people suffering asbestos-related injuries.The challenge to its
reorganization plan came from MacArthur Co., which distributed
asbestos made by Manville.
   The justices also set the stage for an important antitrust case
by agreeing to decide whether states may sue on behalf of those
indirectly affected by illegal price-fixing.
   The court decided to hear an appeal by California, Minnesota,
Alabama and Arizona seeking to participate in a multimillion-dollar
settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix cement prices. Lower
courts had dismissed their efforts to sue for county and municipal
governments that had purchased cement products.
   In the case involving WPPSS, investors, ranging from individuals
to major corporations, had sued WPPSS and numerous others in 1984.
   The Washington State Supreme Court last year upheld a state law
that retroactively expanded protection for cities and utilities
against some bondholder claims.
   That ruling made it more difficult for investors to recover
their losses by suing public agencies. But at the same time the
state court permitted other investor claims to proceed to trial.
   A trial began last month in Tucson, Ariz., in which more than
24,000 bond buyers are charging fraud by 19 defendants _ 16
utilities, two engineering firms and a financial adviser. The
defendants allegedly withheld crucial information from investors
who bought bonds to finance construction of two nuclear power
plants.
   The appeal acted on Monday challenged portions of the 1987
Washington Supreme Court decision upholding state law protections
for cities and utilities.
   In other cases Monday, the justices:
   _Announced they will expand the court's study of drug testing in
the workplace by agreeing to decide whether a railroad may require
workers to take the tests routinely.
   _Rejected arguments aimed at making it easier to sue those
accused of taking part in antitrust conspiracies uncovered years
after they occurred.
   _Agreed to study the power of federal courts to decide some
disputes in which the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
takes charge of a failing state-chartered financial institution.
   _Agreed to decide whether states generally may prosecute
employers for withholding accrued vacation pay owed fired workers.
   _Decided to consider, for the second time in two years, the
authority of states to deny unemployment benefits to people who
refuse to work on their Sabbath.
   _Said it would judge the validity of a 1986 federal law imposing
``user fees'' on pipeline companies.
   _Rejected a challenge to the rates being charged for
transporting oil through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
   _Refused to force an insurance company to help pay for cleaning
up the highly toxic chemical dioxin, disposed of in various
Missouri locations in the early 1970s.
   _Turned away arguments that the policies of the Bonneville Power
Administration are costing electricity consumers in California
billions of dollars.
   _Refused to order the government to compensate the owner of a
Barnwell, S.C., nuclear fuel reprocessing plant that was denied an
operating license due to a Carter administration decision on
curbing international nuclear proliferation.
   _Left intact a ruling that states must compensate tree nursery
owners required to destroy healthy citrus plants that may have been
exposed to an infectious disease.
   _Left intact a $48.3 million judgment awarded Trans World
Airlines against a company founded by the late billionaire Howard
Hughes. TWA charged Summa Corp., formerly called Hughes Tool Co.,
had forced it to lease jets and buy from Hughes when that company
owned 75 percent of TWA stock.
   _Refused to hear an appeal from a New York City developer who
was ordered to remove the top 12 floors of a 31-story condominium
building on Manhattan's fashionable Upper East Side.
   _Agreed to decide whether the federal government may continue to
bar newspapers from carrying advertisements for privately run
lotteries and other games of chance.
   _Agreed to decide whether New York state universities may ban

   Ninety percent of Americans believe the
government should require automakers to build cars with greater
fuel-efficiency, according to a poll commissioned by
environmentalists.
   Two-thirds of the respondents believe they will see another
energy crisis that could bring back gasoline lines, but nearly
three-quarters oppose a 30-cent increase in the gasoline tax aimed
at discouraging consumption, according to the survey by the
Analysis Group Inc., a New Haven, Conn.-based polling firm.
   The pollsters telephoned 1,000 registered voters from Sept.
10-14 for The Communications Consortium, a public relations firm
representing environmental groups. The margin of error in the poll
is about three percentage points.
   The consortium released the results Monday before Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley announced his decision to require auto
companies to average 26.5 miles per gallon for the 1989 model year.
That is up from the 26 mpg standard required for the past three
years but less than the 27.5 mpg requirement that would have
otherwise taken effect under law.
   Stanley B. Greenberg, president of the polling firm, said an
inconsistency between the poll's results and the popularity of
larger, more fuel-hungry cars is ``clearly true in this area and is
also true in almost every area of life that you can imagine.''
   Sixty-seven percent of those questioned predicted a repeat of
energy crises like those of the 1970s, 26 percent said it would not
happen and 7 percent said they did not know.
   Sixty-one percent gave a ``strongly favor'' response to the
proposition that auto companies should be required to build more
fuel efficient cars, an additional 29 percent reported a ``somewhat
favor'' answer with only 8 percent opposed.
   When asked if cars should be required to average 45 mpg in the
year 2000, a position some environmental groups have endorsed, the
poll respondents split 82-15 in favor.
   If such a requirement meant a $500 increase in the price of the
car, the split was still 77-19 in favor.
   Though 56 percent favored a 25-cent per gallon tariff on
imported crude oil ``to reduce our dependence on foreign oil'' and
37 percent opposed it, 72 percent opposed a 30-cent gasoline tax
increase while only 24 percent were in favor.
   By 64-29, the respondents favored policies that would encourage
energy efficiency over increased energy production. Only 9 percent
called for ``a new commitment to the building of new nuclear power
plants.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of
business-related actions taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DRUG TESTS
   
   The court announced it will expand its study of drug testing in
the workplace, agreeing to decide whether a railroad may require
workers to take the tests routinely.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that barred the
Consolidated Rail Corporation, or Conrail, from imposing the tests
without permitting collective bargaining over the issue.
   The court announced earlier this year that it would review two
other drug-testing cases _ one involving railway workers and the
other the U.S. Customs Service.
   Today's action significantly expands the scope of the court's
review by including a case in which a private company _ rather than
the government _ is adopting mandatory drug tests.
   The case is Conrail vs. Railway Labor Executives Association,
88-1.
   
   TRANS WORLD AIRLINES
   
   The court left intact a $48.3 million judgment awarded Trans
World Airlines against a company founded by the late billionaire
Howard Hughes.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Summa Corp.
and William R. Lunnis, administrator of the Hughes estate, that the
award should be thrown out.
   The case is Summa Corp. vs. TWA, 88-149.
   
   LOTTERIES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether the federal government may
continue to bar newspapers from carrying advertisements for
privately run lotteries and other games of chance.
   The justices said they will study a Minnesota Newspaper
Association challenge to a postal law effectively prohibiting such
advertising.
   The cases are Minnesota Newspaper Association vs. Postmaster
General, 87-1943, and Frank vs. Minnesota Newspaper Association,
87-1956.
   
   DIOXIN CLEAN-UP
   
   The court refused to force an insurance company to help pay for
cleaning up dioxin, a highly toxic chemical, disposed of in various
Missouri locations in the early 1970s.
   The justices, without comment, let standa ruling that an
insurance policy held by the chemical firm responsible for the
pollution did not make the insurance company liable for clean-up
costs.
   The case is Missouri vs. Continental Insurance, 87-1953.
   
   PIPELINE FEES
   
   The court, in a case that could bear on a wide range of federal
fees and taxes, agreed to judge the validity of a 1986 federal law
imposing ``user fees'' on pipeline companies.
   The justices said they will hear a Reagan administration
challenge to an Oklahoma court ruling that struck down the law. A
pipeline company that transports hazardous liquids had attacked the
law as unconstitutional.
   The case is Burnley vs. Mid-America Pipeline, 87-2098.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court, setting the stage for an important antitrust ruling,
today agreed to decide whether states may sue in behalf of those
indirectly affected by illegal price-fixing.
   The court voted to hear an appeal by four states _ California,
Minnesota, Alabama and Arizona _ seeking to participate in a
multi-million-dollar settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix
cement prices.
   The case is California vs. ARC America Corp., 87-1862.

<TEXT>
   A stockholder's lawsuit against Media
General Inc. involving the company's two-tiered stock structure was
dismissed Monday by a federal judge.
   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams agreed with arguments by
attorneys for Media General that the complaint of Harvey Jasper, a
New York lawyer who owns 100 shares of company stock, did not have
a strong enough legal basis to proceed to trial. At one time,
Jasper owned 5,000 shares of Media General.
   Williams also rejected an argument by Jasper's attorneys that
the complaint be considered a class action on behalf of other
holders of Media General Class A common stock.
   Jasper's lawsuit contended that a 1987 Media General proxy
statement was misleading about whether the company would accept a
buyout offer. Jasper bought stock after the proxy statement was
issued.
   The statement defined in some detail the relative strengths of
the company's A and B common stock classes. He contended he lost
money on his investments because those who control the stock did
not state the company never would be for sale.
   James W. Tredway, an attorney for Media General, argued that if
the proxy statement lacked any clarity, the problem was resolved in
October 1987 when the company issued a statement after the purchase
of a block of Class A stock by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman.
   The company said it could not imagine circumstances in which
owners of the controlling stock in Media General ever would sell
their shares.
   Jasper's lawsuit was related to an unsuccessful takeover offer
from Sugarman. On Feb. 29, Sugarman proposed to buy all of Media
General's A and B stock for $61.50 a share, then raised the offer
to $70 and also sought to have himself and two associates named to
the Media General board at the May 20 annual meeting.
   At the time of the meeting, Sugarman, his associates and
companies he owns or controls held more than 10 percent of Media
General's Class A stock.
   D. Tennant Bryan, chairman of Media General, and his son, J.
Stewart Bryan III, vice chairman, in effect control the company
through their holdings in Class B stock.
   The Bryans said the firm was not for sale at any price and
opposed election of Sugarman and his associates to the board.
Sugarman lost the proxy fight but has sued the company over the
stock structure and has an appeal pending.
   Among Media General's holdings are The Richmond News Leader, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Tampa (Fla) Tribune.

<HEAD>Media Giant to Sell Television Properties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. said Monday it plans to sell its
eight broadcast television stations, partly to reduce its debt that
has grown to $929 million with its recent purchase of a leading
electronic information concern.
   Knight-Ridder, which also owns 30 daily newspapers, had acquired
the television stations in four separate transactions over the past
decade for an aggregate price of $291 million.
   Each of the stations are affiliated with one of the three major
networks and are located on the VHF band which runs from stations 2
to 13.
   The company said it planned to sell the stations individually or
in one or more groups.
   The stations put up for sale are WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tenn.;
KTVY-TV in Oklahoma City; WPRI-TV in Providence, R.I.; WTKR-TV in
Norfolk, Va.; WTEN-TV in Albany, N.Y.; WJRT-TV in Flint, Mich.;
WALA-TV in Mobile, Ala., and KOLD-TV in Tucson, Ariz.
   Charles Crane, a media analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities
in New York, said the stations could command a price of about $350
million to $400 million.
   He said he expects a number of public and private buyers would
be interested despite recent weakness in the advertising market
because each of the stations would go for less thn $100 million.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Knight-Ridder rose
12{ cents a share to $40.87{.
   James K. Batten, Knight-Ridder president and chief executive,
said the company's board approved the sale in part to pay for its
$353 million acquisition in August of Dialog Information Services
Inc. from Lockheed Corp. Dialog operates an electronic information
retrieval service providing more than 320 data bases in areas
ranging from business to technology, science and education and has
96,000 subscribers in 86 countries.
   ``In approving the Dialog acquisition, we knew it would be
necessary to dispose of some assets to raise the funds to pay for
the purchase,'' Batten said.
   He said the sale will ``allow the company to convert to cash a
substantial amount of previously unrecognized appreciation, to
significantly reduce its debt level and to offset much of the
on-going earnings per share dilution associated with the Dialog
acquisition.''
   The Dialog acquisition boosted Knight-Ridder's total debt to
$929 million.
   Knight-Ridder has owned television stations since 1978, when it
bought the stations in Providence, Albany and Flint from Poole
Broadcasting Co. for $45 million.
   It acquired the Norfolk station in 1981 from Landmark
Communications Inc. for $48 million, and paid $38 million to
acquire the Nashville station two years later from General Electric
Co.
   Knight-Ridder paid $160 million for the stations in Oklahoma
City, Mobile and Tucson from the Evening News Association in 1986.
   As a group, the television stations posted operating income of
$14.5 million on revenue of $104.5 million in 1987, compared with
operating income of $22.2 million on revenue of $102.6 million in
1986.
   Frank N. Hawkins Jr., vice president for corporate relations and
planning for Knight-Ridder, said the company expects the stations
will post an operating profit close to its 1986 level this year on
higher revenue.
   He declined to say what the company hoped to get for the
stations. He said it hopes to complete the sale by the end of the
first quarter of 1989.
   The investment firm Goldman Sachs & Co. has been hired to handle
the sale.
   Prudential-Bache's Crane estimated the stations have had pre-tax
cash flow of about $30 million, and that some recent station sales
have gone at 12 to 14 times cash flow before taxes.
   He said Knight-Ridder appears to have decided to ``swap a modest
growth business for a high-growth business'' in moving away from
broadcasting and into information services.
   But he said newspapers will still account for about 85 percent
of the company's overall profit.
   For all of 1987, Knight-Ridder earned $155.2 million on revenue
of $2.07 billion.
   Batten said the sale fits the company's new strategic direction.
   ``We believe the acquisition of additional newspapers, business
and electronic information companies, cable television operations
and our own stock will help achieve our goals,'' he said.
   Knight-Ridder is a partner with Tele-Communications Inc., a
Denver-based cable operator, in TKR Cable, a cable system with
about 270,000 subscribers in New York and New Jersey.

   Stock prices sagged in light trading Monday,
starting off the final quarter of 1988 on a wary note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.65 to 2,105.26.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
536 up, 954 down and 444 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.38 million
shares, down from 175.75 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 150.47 million shares.
   Wall Streeters were generally resigning themselves to a sluggish
week, expecting investors to back away from stocks before the
government issues its monthly report Friday on the employment
situation.
   Analysts look for the data to show a pickup in payroll
employment growth for September after relatively modest increases
in July and August.
   If those estimates prove correct, it would come as a setback to
hopes that the economy was slowing to a pace that would satisfy the
Federal Reserve, which is seeking to keep inflation from heating up.
   The Commerce Department reported Monday that new factory orders
rose 3.1 percent in August.
   With all that, however, the market finished well above its
midday lows, when the Dow Jones industrials showed a loss of as
much as 25 points.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down ] at 44];
International Business Machines, down { at 114~; General Electric,
down [ at 43\, and Coca-Cola, down | at 43[.
   In the plus column, Ford Motor gained } to 51~ and Eastman Kodak
rose ~ to 45~.
   Technology issues were broadly lower. Digital Equipment fell 1
to 92~, and Hewlett-Packard [ to 49}, while in the over-the-counter
market Intel lost 1[ to 26] and Apple Computer was down } at 42{.
   Japanese stocks also were weak following declines Saturday and
Monday in the Tokyo stock market. Honda Motor dropped 4\ to 156};
Matsushita Electrical 4~ to 181[, and Kyocera 1 to 76.
   Mylan Laboratories fell ~ to 8}. The company estimated lower
earnings for the fiscal quarter that ended last week.
   Middle South Utilities bucked the downtrend, rising [ to 15[ in
active trading. On Friday the company declared its first
common-stock dividend in three years.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $7.47 billion, or 0.28
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .34 to 153.23.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell .53 to 311.14, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was down .53 at 271.38.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 3.23 to 384.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 300 even, down 1.63.

<TEXT>
   Toshiba Corp.'s U.S. arm introduced two portable
computers and two portable printers Monday in a combination news
conference and fashion show that featured models showing off the
equipment at a New York hotel.
   The T5200, which uses Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line 80386
microprocessor, is not a true laptop computer because it cannot run
on batteries. It is also heavier than most laptops, at just under
19 pounds.
   The T1600, which is built on Intel's 80C286 chip, can run on
batteries and weighs in at 11.6 pounds. Toshiba called it the top
of its battery-powered PC line.
   The T5200 has a suggested retail price of $9,499 to $10,999 and
will be available later this year. The T1600 is priced at $4,999
and will be available early next year, according to Toshiba America
Inc. in Irvine, Calif.
   Toshiba said the printers both provide letter-quality output.
The ExpressWriter311 is $589 and has a November delivery date,
while the ExpressWriter301 is $489 and scheduled for shipment in
February.

<HEAD>USDA Report Sends Pork Futures Prices Tumbling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Department of Agriculture report indicating that hog
supplies next spring and summer may be larger than expected sent
hog and pork belly prices plummeting Monday at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork belly prices closed limit-down in several months, while hog
prices also fell the limit before gaining some strength at the
close.
   The quarterly report buoyed grain prices, while soybean prices
were mixed.
   In other markets, oil prices tumbled; live cattle prices rallied
while feeder cattle were mixed; gold and silver futures prices
advanced; and coffee prices fell sharply.
   At the Mercantile Exchange, ``the big news was the hog and pig
report,'' said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
   The quarterly report, released after the close of trading
Friday, showed higher-than-expected numbers of pigs to be born in
the coming months, which will mean larger spring and summer hog
supplies than anticipated, Morgan said,
   The report sent pork belly prices tumbling, and they closed down
their daily 2-cents-a-pound limit in all but one contract month.
Hog prices fell their daily 1{-cent limit during the session but
recovered some of the lost ground before the close.
   ``There's more hogs coming down the road than what people were
looking for, and that's why the market sold off, particularly in
the deferred months,'' Morgan said.
   Cattle prices got a boost from a stronger cash market and
expectations of tightening cattle supplies in the coming months,
Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .60 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in October at 72.35 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with October at
82.50 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent to 1.42 cents lower with
October at 39.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.95
cents to 2 cents lower with February at 50.32 cents a pound.
   Grains futures prices were mostly higher while soybean prices
were mixed at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``Wheat and corn benefited from Friday's (USDA) quarterly stocks
report, which showed a little less corn and wheat ... than
expected,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Another bullish signal came from the USDA's pig report,
Lespinasse said, as corn is a major food source for pigs.
   The soy complex, especially soybean meal _ another important
feed for pigs _ also gained some support from the pig report, as
well as from the strength in the wheat and bean pits, he said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 7{ cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.22\ a bushel; corn settled unchanged to
5 cents higher, with December at $2.90 cents a bushel; oats were 3\
cents to 7 cents higher with December at $2.48{ a bushel; and
soybeans settled 7 cents lower to 4 cents higher, with November at
$8.17 a bushel.
   Oil prices continued their steep descent, flirting with the
$13-a-barrel level in a stiff test of lows not seen in two years.
   The November contract of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude which plunged 55 cents a barrel Friday, skidded another
31 cents to settle at $13.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Crude prices haven't closed this low since August 1986.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer and the world's biggest
exporter, issued a sharply worded statement late in the day saying
that while it believes returning to prescribed production levels
``is the best way for restoring full stability'' to world oil
markets, it will not ``freeze'' its own production while others
continue to violate their ceilings.
   Crude oil settled 28 cents to 31 cents lower, with November at
$13.06 a barrel; heating oil was .94 cent to 1.05 cents lower, with
November at 37.78 cents a gallon; and unleaded gas was .25 cent to
.95 cent lower, with November at 41.98 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures prices seemed immune to weakness in the
crude oil market and rallied on the New York Commodity Exchange,
``largely to correct an oversold condition,'' said Bernard Savaiko,
an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Gold prices settled $3 to $3.20 higher, with the contract for
delivery in October at $397.50 a troy ounce; silver prices settled
11 cents to 11.3 cents higher with October at $6.248 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures prices fell sharply on expectations that Arabica
coffees _ those traded at the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New
York _ will become more available due to the International Cofee
Organization's compromise plan for 1988-89, announced over the
weekend.
   The organization set an initial export quota at 58 million bags,
but will allow for somewhat less than that depending on market
conditions. Traders had anticipated a smaller initial quota that
would increase, analysts said.
   Coffee prices settled unchanged to 5.64 cents lower, with
December at $1.262 a pound.

<HEAD>Perot Files Countersuit Against EDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wealthy entrepreneur Ross Perot has countersued
his former company, Electronic Data Systems, after the computer
services firm accused him in a lawsuit of violating a covenant
against competing with EDS.
   Perot, former chairman of EDS, filed the countersuit Friday in
U.S. District Court.
   Perot founded EDS in 1962 and sold it to General Motors Corp. in
1984.
   The relationship between Perot and GM soon soured, and Perot and
three other top EDS executives left the firm in December 1986 when
GM agreed to pay them about $850 million. Perot also stepped down
from GM's board.
   Last week, EDS filed a suit in which it claimed Perot violated
an agreement to refrain from competing with the data-processing
company for at least three years after he left the company.
   The EDS suit, filed in state court in Virginia, also named
Perot's new company, Virginia-based Perot Systems Group, as a
defendant.
   In papers filed with his countersuit in federal court in Dallas,
Perot sought an injunction to prevent EDS and GM from interfering
in Perot Systems Group's business activities.
   Perot contends the suit is groundless and will ``boomerang'' on
EDS.
   Earlier this year, Perot proposed to automate the U.S. Postal
Service and his company was awarded a no-bid contract for the job.
   But after protests by EDS and other companies, the General
Services Administration suspended Perot's postal contract.
   Perot has challenged the GSA's suspension of the contract. The
Postal Service contract is one of Perot's activities that EDS
claims violate the 1986 agreement.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar weakened Monday in response to
plunging oil prices, which were seen as easing inflation pressure
in the United States and lessening demand for currency to pay for
dollar-quoted oil contracts.
   Gold prices rose in what dealers described as largely a
technical and temporary reaction to the metal's fall last week,
which also was a response to declining oil prices. Republic
National Bank quoted bullion at $396.95 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT,
up from $394.00 late Friday.
   Currency brokers said oil futures prices' toward the
$13-a-barrel level signaled lower inflation in the United States
and therefore lower U.S. interest rates, making investments in
dollars less attractive.
   Moreover, because most oil contracts are priced in the U.S.
currency, cheaper oil means buyers will not need as many dollars.
Therefore, said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at Banco di
Sicilia's New York branch, ``we have less demand for dollars to pay
for the oil.''
   Other analysts said the dollar was weakened by European press
reports quoting West German central bank president Karl Otto Poehl
as saying further erosion of the mark's value was undesirable. The
reported remarks implied West Germany would sell dollars to thwart
a steep rise in the currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to 133.90 yen. Later in
London it was quoted at 133.80 yen. By the time trading ended in
New York the dollar fetched 133.67 yen, down from 133.75 yen late
Friday.
   The British pound strengthened against the dollar in London to
$1.6990, against $1.6905 late Friday. Later in New York, the pound
rose to $1.7019 from $1.6935 late Friday.
   Other New York late-dollar rates, compared with levels late
Friday, included: 1.8617 West German marks, down from 1.8690;
1.5820 Swiss francs, down from 1.5830; 1.2097 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2167; 6.3420 French francs, down from 6.3595; and
1,387.00 Italian lire, down from 1,393.50.
   Late-dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday,
ioncluded: 1.8608 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5785 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5830; 6.3350 French francs, down from 6.3700;
2.1010 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1185; 1,397.95 Italian lire, up
from 1,396.50; and 1.2104 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2171.
   Gold prices rebounded in Europe and the United States because of
short-covering, in which dealers buy gold contracts to repay
borrowed contracts they had sold earlier. Nevertheless, many
dealers said overall pressure on gold likely would continue to
erode its value.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose $3.10 a troy ounce to $397.50.
   In London, gold rose to $397.75 from $394.45 late Friday and in
Zurich it rose to $397 from $396 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold
eased to $397.91 from $399.22.
   Silver for current delivery rose 11.3 cents a troy ounce on the
New York Comex to $6.248. In London, silver rose to $6.22 from
$6.14.

<HEAD>Silicon Graphics Announces Cheaper Work Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silicon Graphics Inc. is scheduled to announce
on Tuesday a computer work station with three-dimensional graphics
that is priced at less than $16,000, a direct challenge to neighbor
Sun Microsystems Inc.
   Sun Microsystems' least expensive three-dimensional graphics
workstation starts at slightly more than $30,000.
   Work stations are fast versions of personal computers and are
used mainly by scientists, engineers and lately business and
finance professionals.
   Silicon Graphics, which like Sun is based in Mountain View,
Calif., already has a line of work stations priced from $45,000 to
$90,000. That line has captured about 25 percent of the $600
million high-end work station market, according to the current
issue of Business Week.
   The Personal Iris is the cheapest member of a new family of work
stations, including six members of the Iris Power family that start
at $54,900.
   ``This is the most significant product announcement in the
history of the company,'' James H. Clark, the chairman and founder,
said in a news release.
   In another recent boost, Silicon Graphics last month licensed
its three-dimensional graphics technology to International Business
Machines Corp.
   IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are preparing to make major
moves into the work station market, which has been dominated by the
likes of Sun, Silicon Graphics and Apollo Computer Inc. of
Chelmsford, Mass.

Securities Firms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Banking Committee chairman, William
Proxmire, D-Wis., on Monday proposed a parliamentary maneuver that
would, if successful, allow Congress to pass legislation permitting
bank holding companies to own securities firms.
   The Senate in March overwhelmingly passed a bill allowing
affiliates of bank holding companies to underwrite most kinds of
securities, except corporate stock.
   In the House, the Banking Committee and the Energy and Commerce
Committee have passed competing versions. Both impose more
restrictions on banks and offer fewer new powers, but the Energy
and Commerce version is the most restrictive.
   The dispute between the committees has turned into a
jurisdictional war between Energy and Commerce Chairman John
Dingell, D-Mich., and Banking Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.
   So far, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has insisted that the
two settle their differences before the banking bill comes to the
House floor.
   In a letter last week to Wright, St Germain said he and Dingell
had been unable to agree and he complained that the Dingell
committee's ``overly broad perception ... of its jurisdiction has
... paralyze(d) ... one of the most important banking acts of this
century.''
   With Congress planning to adjourn at the end of the week,
Proxmire is proposing that most of the Senate bill be attached to
an unrelated banking bill already passed by the House. Other parts
of the Senate bill could be passed separately or linked to an
unrelated securities bill sponsored by Dingell that toughens
penalties for insider trading.
   Under the Proxmire plan, the banking-securities legislation then
could be ironed out in a conference between leaders in both
chambers before coming up for a vote in the full House and Senate.
That way, the House Rules Committee would not have to make a
decision on the competing jurisdictional claims of Dingell and St
Germain.
   Also, in a move to meet the concerns of St Germain and of Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has threatened to block the
maneuver, Proxmire added a series of ``pro-consumer'' provisions to
the bill, including a requirement that banks cash government checks
for non-customers and offer ``lifeline'' banking accounts to poor
people.

<HEAD>Golden Nugget Agrees To Purchase Claridge Casino</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Wynn, the flamboyant hotel and
casino operator who sold his Golden Nugget casino here last year,
has agreed to purchase Del E. Webb Corp.'s Claridge Casino Hotel
for $110 million, officials announced Monday.
   Wynn's acquisition of the financially-troubled Claridge from the
Phoenix-based company is subject to approval by New Jersey gaming
regulators and Atlantic City Boardwalk Associates, the limited
partnership that leases the Claridge's real estate.
   Del Webb, which has a 10 percent interest in the Claridge, has
the management contract for the facility.
   The company and Atlantic City Boardwalk Associates have been
seeking a possible buyer since May for the 501-room Claridge. Hotel
president Roger Wagner has said more than 170 potential purchasers
have contacted Del Webb's investment banker, Oppenheimer & Co.,
about the Claridge.
   Ed Wren, a Del Webb spokesman, said Monday the company suffered
a $96.6 million net loss in 1987, with the Claridge responsible for
78.8 percent of the loss.
   ``From Del Webb's standpoint, we think the completion of this
sale will provide benefits to investors that might not otherwise be
available,'' he said.
   Wren said Del Webb has been selling off assets in its leisure
group, which includes other casino and recreational properties. On
Friday, Wynn closed a deal to purchase the Nevada Club casino in
Laughlin, Nev., from Del Webb for $40 million.
   ``Our working relationship with the Golden Nugget on the sale of
our other hotel was excellent, so we are optimistic about the
Claridge,'' Wren said.
   Wynn could not be reached for comment. He did not return calls
to his office in Las Vegas, Nev., where he has built a gaming
empire on the city's famed casino strip.
   Marvin Roffman, a gaming analyst with the Philadelphia
investment group Janney Montgomery Scott, said Wynn's re-entry into
the Atlantic City casino market could mean intense competition for
the resort's other gaming halls.
   Roffman said that because Wynn's purchase price was relatively
low, ``his overhead will be lower than anybody else in town, so he
can give tremendous leeway to the bettor.''
   ``If he does do this, it will have serious implications for his
competitors, because casinos in Atlantic City don't like to give up
even one customer,'' Roffman said. ``Generally speaking, they tend
to match what the competition is doing to defend their market
share...but when you raise the odds, you lower what the house wins.
If you're running a high-priced operation, you can't do it.''
   Wynn left the Atlantic City casino industry in 1987 when he sold
the Golden Nugget in the resort to Bally Corp. for $440 million.
The sale was a factor in blocking rival Donald Trump's efforts to
take over Bally's Park Place Casino hotel in Atlantic City.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the United Auto Workers
said Monday that ratification votes on a proposed three-year labor
agreement would be held this weekend at Deere & Co. factory and
warehouse sites in five states.
   The company reached an agreement in principle early Saturday
with the union, which represents 13,400 blue-collar workers in
Illinois, Iowa, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Denver. The tentative
agreement capped a marathon 20-hour bargaining session.
   Details of the proposed contract have not been disclosed. The
contract would take effect immediately upon ratification and would
run through midnight Sept. 30, 1991.
   Deere and the UAW negotiated daily for nearly two months before
the settlement was announced at 5:08 a.m. CDT Saturday, at a
negotiating site in Moline, Ill., near Deere's world headquarters.
   Negotiators worked past a midnight Friday strike deadline with
no formal extension of the current contract or call for a walkout.
   The union did not call for a strike, but scattered pickets were
reported at Deere plants in East Moline, Ill., and Dubuque, Iowa.
   Deere and the union are trying to avoid a repeat of the bitter
five-month strike in 1986-87 that ended after 163 days with
employees' acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions.

<HEAD>Officials Hail Sharp Drop in U.S. Trade Deficit With Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan substantially reduced its trade surplus
with the United States the past year but can still do more, U.S.
Assistant Commerce Secretary Louis F. Laun said Monday.
   ``The best insurance against (U.S.) trade protectionism is for
you to show us that your markets are as open as ours,'' Laun said
in a greeting to the 14th ``Buy American'' mission from Taiwan.
   At a ceremony in Washington, members of the 45-member promotion
group signed contracts to buy $160 million worth of American goods.
It was the first stop of a three-week, 11-state tour expected to
make total purchases of at least $532 million.
   The island's foreign trade chief told the gathering Taiwan would
like a free trade agreement with the United States like those
arranged with Canada and Israel.
   Laun said the U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan was down by 37
percent in the first half of 1988. Taiwan officials said their
trade surplus for January to August this year was $6.4 billion,
41.7 percent less than that during the same period of 1987.
   Taiwan also has allowed its currency to gain 40 percent in value
against the U.S. dollar, making U.S. goods more attractively
priced, but ``there is still a way to go,'' Laun said.
   Taiwan has reduced tariffs on U.S. products from 28 percent to
14 percent, but here too, ``there is still a way to go,'' he said.

   The U.S. currency inched down following its lower closing on
Wall Street overnight, according to a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The dollar was moving very little between the mid-133 yen and
134-yen range, without any fresh market-affecting news,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The dealer said some participants were buying the dollar, but
dollar-selling still was stronger.
   On the stock exchange, ``the economic factors around stock
trading are almost the best they could be, and share prices should
not keep falling like this,'' said Manji Ueda with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Other dealers said share prices were lower in reaction to the
decline overnight on Wall Street.

<HEAD>USAir Flight Attendants Ratify 1-Year Labor Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir flight attendants have approved a new
one-year labor agreement that includes wage parity for former
Pacific Southwest flight attendants, the Association of Flight
Attendants announced Monday.
   The union said the contract approved by the 4,000 USAir flight
attendants that it represents included an across-the-board 3
percent pay raise for all USAir attendants, plus a compromise on
the divisive pay parity issue.
   USAir acquired Pacific Southwest in May 1987 but operated it as
a separate subsidiary until last April before merging the two
operations.
   The current contract was up for renewal and amendment Sept. 1.
The new contract was reached Aug. 25 in Pittsburgh after 10 days of
intense negotiations there.
   The flight attendants union said in a news release that PSA base
pay will increase by 25 percent of the difference between PSA and
USAir pay rates, beginning April 9, 1989. Full parity for PSA
attendants will occur on the date of the merger of USAir and
Piedmont Airlines, which was expected to occur in March or April.
   The contract also includes PSA attendants in USAir's pension
plan. USAir will credit PSA flight attendants with up to 15 years
of past service for its pension plan.
   The 961 former Pacific Southwest attendants had been represented
by the Teamsters but voted to switch to the Association of Flight
Attendants just prior to USAir's acquisition of PSA.
   Union officials have said said the former PSA attendants
generally were on pay scales about 10 percent less than those at
USAir. The company had offered to bring the two groups of workers
to parity over a three-year period.
   The union had wanted that accomplished faster. When the two
sides reached an impasse last spring, many attendants refused to
work overtime on the Memorial Day weekend, forcing USAir to cancel
some 170 flights then.
   The union and the company now must go through the same process
to integrate a contract covering some 3,000 flight attendants at
Piedmont Airlines into the USAir accord.
   USAir purchased Piedmont last November.

<HEAD>Feds Say They To Seek Fraud Charges Against Data Company, Some
Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have told Recognition
Equipment Inc. that they plan to seek fraud charges against the
computer data company and some of its top officials following an
investigation into alleged procurement irregularities, the company
said Monday.
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Washington announced ``the
investigation into procurement irregularities involving multiline
sorters for the USPS (U.S. Postal Service) is nearing a
conclusion.''
   Federal officials said ``the possibility exists'' that charges
could be brought against REI ``and-or some of its employees.'' A
grand jury in Washington will be asked to consider charges this
week, REI officials said.
   The company ``has been advised that the investigation has been
completed and that the U.S. Attorney's office intends to seek an
indictment against the company; its chief executive officer,
William G. Moore Jr.; and a vice president, Robert W. Reedy,'' the
statement said.
   ``The U.S. Attorney's office advised that it expects the
indictment would charge conspiracy to defraud the United States
along with theft and fraud counts,'' according to the statement.
   A company spokesman said REI denies the allegations and intends
to vigorously defend itself.
   Prosecutors had focused on Irving, Texas-based REI's campaign in
1985 and 1986 to get a $250 million mail-sorting contract. The
company allegedly proposed a contract-sharing deal with a
competitor, according to a report compiled by postal inspectors
assisting in the investigation.
   Company officials, in a statement, said REI has had recent
discussions with the U.S. Attorney's office and Justice Department
regarding the investigation.
   ``If charges are brought against the company, they could
adversely affect the company's ability to do business with the
federal government,'' said the statement.
   In the first 10 months of its current fiscal year, REI got about
10 percent of its revenue from federal government business.

<HEAD>CSX Third Quarter Earnings Up 15.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Corp. said Monday its third quarter
profit was up by 15.4 percent over the same period last year.
   The international transportation company posted a profit of $120
million, or 75 cents a share, for the third quarter, up from a
profit of $104 million, 67 cents per share, in the same quarter
last year.
   Third quarter operating revenue rose to $1.89 billion from $1.76
billion a year earlier.
   Operating income rose in the company's rail and properties
groups and at its Sea-Land shipping unit, but declined in its barge
unit due to drought conditions that snarled river traffic in many
areas.
   CSX is restructuring to emphasize its core businesses and reduce
labor costs.
   In September, the company announced another phase of
restructuring with the repurchasing of up to 60 million shares of
CSX common stock for not less than $28 and not more than $33 a
share.
   The CSX board of directors also ordered the liquidation of the
company's natural gas operations and resort properties.
   For the first nine months of the year, CSX posted a profit of
$25 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $303 million, or
$1.96 per share, a year earlier. The decline stemmed from a special
pre-tax charge of $778 million taken in the second quarter to cover
the cost of early separation agreements with unions, incurred under
the restructuring.
   Without the charge, CSX said, nine-month profit would have been
$517 million, or $3.27 a share.
   Operating revenue during the nine-month period rose to $5.54
billion from $5.11 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   J. Ralph Corbett, founder of NuTone Co., a
pioneer in the manufacture of home door chimes, and a noted patron
of the arts, died Monday at a Cincinnati retirement community. He
was 91.
   Corbett founded NuTone, an electrical manufacturing company, in
Cincinnati in 1936. The company, considered the world's largest
maker of home door chimes, was sold in 1967 to Scovill
Manufacturing Co. of Waterbury, Conn.
   Corbett also established the Corbett Foundation, which since its
founding in 1955 has given almost $30 million to the arts.
   Corbett was born Dec. 5, 1896, in the Flushing section of the
New York City borough of Queens. He married Patricia Barry, a
radio-television singer and Long Island native, on July 23, 1930.
   He received a bachelor of law degree at the New York University
Law School in 1923. Corbett began his business career in New York
City as a marketing consultant and adviser to manufacturers and
financial organizations in the East, and moved to Cincinnati in
1933.
   Survivors include his wife, Patricia; a daughter, a son, and a
grandson.
   A memorial sevice is scheduled for Oct. 18 at the University of
Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music.

<HEAD>United Appeals Awarding Of Seattle-Tokyo Route To Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines on Monday asked the federal
Department of Transportation to reconsider its Sept. 22 decision
awarding United's lucrative Seattle-Tokyo air route to Continental
Airlines.
   United, which had been expected to appeal the decision, said in
a news release that Continental had received the route through a
``procedural quirk,'' that United had forged the route into a
``national asset,'' and that competing Japanese carriers ``would be
elated by a divestiture that would weaken the competitive vigor of
United.
   ``...That is precisely why such a result runs flatly contrary to
the public interest,'' the statement said.
   The Transportation Department made its decision after the
Justice Department refused to challenge a federal court decision in
August ordering the route be given to Continental.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley reportedly had argued in
favor of appealing the case, but the Justice Department refused to
take further legal action.
   The court decision favoring Continental upheld, on procedural
grounds, an administrative law judge's original ruling in the
controversy last year. Since that administrative judge's ruling, a
succession of senior department officials have disagreed over who
should get the route, choosing United at one point, and then
American Airlines.
   United has flown the Seattle-Tokyo route since April 1983.
   The Seattle-Tokyo route previously was flown by Pan American
World Airways, but United assumed the route temporarily when it
purchased Pan Am's Pacific Division in 1986.
   The Transportation Department approved United's acquisition of
the Pan Am routes only under the condition that the Seattle-Tokyo
route be dealt with separately.
   Stephen Wolf, United's chairman and president, contends that the
selection process was flawed.
   ``...the public deserves more from its government than to have a
vital decision of national transportation policy with such
important consequences hinge on a procedural accident,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scandinavian Airline Makes Deal With U.S. Carrier</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New York news conference scheduled to begin 8 a.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airlines System and Texas Air Corp. scheduled a
joint Tuesday morning news conference in New York to announce what
SAS said was a major cooperation deal with a U.S. airline.
   The news conference comes amid unconfirmed reports in the United
States and Europe that SAS might acquire a stake in Texas Air, or
that the two companies would engage in a cooperative business
effort.
   SAS and Texas Air scheduled an 8 a.m. EDT news conference at New
York's Plaza Hotel to announce the deal. Texas Air Chairman Frank
Lorenzo and SAS President Jan Carlzon also scheduled a later news
conference at the Plaza.
   SAS officials in Stockholm, Sweden said Monday the airline had
reached a cooperation deal with a major U.S. carrier, but declined
to give details or identify the carrier.
   The Washington Post reported in its Tuesday editions that SAS
was negotiating to buy a stake in Houston-based Texas Air, the
owner of Eastern and Continental airlines. Citing unidentified
industry sources, the newspaper said Carlzon traveled to Texas in
recent weeks to negotiate with the airline holding company.
   Tuesday's New York Times indicated SAS and Texas Air were
expected to announce an agreement to coordinate their schedules to
offer customers the shortest times between major destinations, in
an attempt to attract more business travelers.
   Other reports speculated SAS would buy some of Eastern's
Atlantic or domestic U.S. routes, including landing rights in
Miami, to which SAS long has sought access.
   SAS information director Knut Lovstuhagen refused to confirm
reports on Monday, but said the deal was ``extensive.''
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, which is 50 percent owned by the
governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, has tried to develop a
``global axis'' strategy.
   But negotiations on several other deals fell through last year,
including talks with the Belgian national carrier SABENA, with
British Caledonian and with Aerolinas Argentinas.
   Texas Air is the largest U.S. airline company, while SAS is the
eighth-largest European airline.
