   Thirty-three percent of the people surveyed
Tuesday following Attorney General Edwin Meese III's announcement
that he has submitted his resignation said Meese should have quit
sooner, a poll found.
   The poll, conducted for USA Today and Cable News Network, found
that 22 percent supported Meese's decision and 25 percent said he
should have opted to stay at the Justice Department. Twenty percent
said they didn't know.
   The telephone survey of 646 people was conducted by Gordon S.
Black Corp. and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   Meese announced he will resign later this month or in early
August. His announcement came after an independent prosecutor's
14-month probe into his official conduct ended without indictment.

   A moderate earthquake shook the Owens
Valley east of the Sierra Nevada, but there were no reports of
damage or injuries.
   The earthquake registered 4.5 on the Richter scale at 11:18 a.m.
Tuesday and was centered 10 miles south of Lone Pine, according to
readings from the California Institute of Technology Seismology Lab
in Pasadena.
   Lone Pine is about 170 miles north of Los Angeles.
   ``I was just leaning against the wall and I felt a little
`whoops-ee-doo,''' said Teri Lepak, who works for the Los Angeles
Department of Water & Power office. ``The chandelier kind of
swayed, but somebody quickly realized that it was only an
earthquake and we weren't going crazy.''
   Dorothy Shunkwiler, a dispatcher for the Inyo County Sheriff,
said the office received no calls of damage or injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause
moderate damage in a populated area.

   Iranian gunboats raided a merchant vessel
in the Strait of Hormuz in a predawn strike Wednesday and set it on
fire, said shipping executives based in the Persian Gulf.
   The executives identified the ship as the Atlantic Ocean and
said it had a Korean crew. They had no further details.
   The ship put out a distress signal at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday (6:30
p.m. EDT Tuesday), said the executives, who spoke on condition they
not be identified.
   The vessel reported a fire on board and asked for assistance.
   The attack, just three days after a U.S. warship shot down an
Iranian passenger jet, underscored Iran's determination to continue
the ``tanker war'' in the gulf to defeat Iraq, whom it has been
fighting since September 1980.

<TEXT>
   A man who opened fire outside a small inner-city
home Tuesday afternoon wounded four children and an adult, killing
an 8-year-old girl playing in the front yard, Miami police said.
   Michael Ward, 25, was arrested immediately after the 5:15 p.m.
shooting and charged with murder and four counts of attempted
murder, said police spokesman Sam Harlan.
   ``We believe it was all the result of an argument,'' said police
spokeswoman Cory Zywotow. ``He had a .357 revolver in his hand, and
he was shooting at the house and anything that got in the way.''
   The incident occurred in the impoverished Liberty City
neighborhood, the site of 1980 race riots that left 18 dead, 400
injured and $100 million in damage.
   Witnesses say that only minutes before the shots rang out, a
group of teen-age boys was involved in a brawl that eventually
moved to the yard of the one-story home. The homeowner ran the boys
off, but one of the boys returned along with his angry,
gun-wielding uncle.
   ``The man just came up to the gate and started shooting _ pow,
pow pow,'' said a 12-year-old witness, Shontell English. ``He shot
the girl until she was dead. He shot the man last _ in his back.''
   Eight-year-old Chelsea Wiley was playing in the front yard with
three other children when a bullet hit her in the head, Ms. Zywotow
said. The girl was found dead at the scene clutching a blanket.
   The four others injured in the shooting were taken to Jackson
Memorial Hospital.
   Johnny Edmondson, 23, the only adult in the home, was being
treated for gunshot wounds to the abdomen and buttocks, police said.
   Jennifer Royal, 4, was shot in the back, and another girl,
Adrian Robinson, 3, was hit in the left arm, Ms. Zywotow said.
Derrick Robinson, 2, was grazed in the head by a stray bullet and
not seriously hurt.
   Two other small children were in the home at the time of the
shooting but were not hit, police said.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez came to the crime scene after the
shooting, calling it a ``terrible tragedy.''

   Iowa's governor said Tuesday he might declare a statewide
drought emergency, and an Indiana official warned of possible power
shortages as generating plants ran low on cooling water.
   Farmers in the Southeast celebrated rain and high prices because
of the Midwest's problems, and a new heat wave spread water
restrictions and brushfires into the Northeast.
   A dispute over diversion of Lake Michigan water continued to
cause friction between Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley states as
one of the Mississippi River's shipping channels shrank to a depth
of only 7 feet.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said he may issue an emergency
declaration unless rainfall is widespread this week, even though
federal officials say it's too early to assess drought damage.
   ``It's early enough to know it's a real disaster,'' said
Branstad, who is carrying his case for emergency aid to Washington
this week. ``We don't want to see a lot of farm families forced
back into bankruptcy.''
   But South Carolina farmers were optimistic that record yields
would combine with higher prices, although rain in the Southeast
helped push corn and soybean prices down on the Chicago Commodities
Exchange.
   ``We're looking at another billion dollar year,'' said state
Agriculture Commissioner D. Leslie Tindal.
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., said Tuesday that the drought
will save the federal government $5.3 billion to $10.85 billion in
reduced farm subsidies and the entire amount should be allocated to
rural America.
   ``The good Lord in effect made the money available by
devastasting a lot of farmers,'' said Durenburger, who is in a
heated re-election campaign.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of mainly liberal farm groups called for
an investigation of the federal government's grain reserve program.
   The Iowa Farm Unity Coalition said export subsidies created
profits for grain companies and drained reserves just when they
were needed by small livestock producers.
   ``What's on the line in this drought is the future of the family
farm system,'' said coalition spokesman Dixon Terry.
   A spokeswoman for ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb., grain company,
dismissed the coalition's claim, saying the company tends to
prosper when farmers do well.
   ``We have seen no big new profits in grain merchandising because
of the drought,'' said spokeswoman Lynn Phares.
   She said her company tends to do well when farmers do well, not
when times are tough in agriculture.
   Side effects continued to spread, with bug experts saying
conditions are ideal for grasshoppers and golfers celebrating as
balls bounced farther down hard, dry fairways.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who fears temporary diversions to
the Mississippi would become permanent and lower lake levels, said
Illinois actually wanted Lake Michigan water to flush out Chicago's
sewage. Chicago officials said the drought had had no effect on
sewage.
   More than 2,000 barges were backed up Tuesday by shallow water
at Natchez and Greenville, Miss., where a dredge was deepening the
channel from 7 to 15 feet. Some towboat operators were working in
convoy so they could help each other off sandbars.
   Robert D. Glazier of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission
said a prolonged drought would leave some power plants with less
cooling water and might create environmental problems if too much
hot water was pumped back into low streams.
   Further downriver, officials said the tip of a wedge of salt
water moving up from the Gulf of Mexico may reach New Orleans water
intakes Wednesday. They was trying to determine how much salt water
the processing system can handle.
   Dry conditions and July Fourth fireworks encouraged fires across
the nation, but most were under control Tuesday.
   Hunting restrictions on waterfowl were being considered because
normal breeding areas had dried out, but the same conditions also
prevented mosquitoes from reproducing. Fish faced a mixed blessing
_ less water to swim in, fewer fishermen to dodge.
   ``It's not aesthetically pleasing to sit out in the sun and cook
your brains out,'' said Ted Crowell of Kentucky's Department of
Fish and Wildlife Resources.
   Dry weather has spread to the Northeast in recent weeks, causing
fires in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey and leading to water
restrictions and warnings to campers in some areas.
   ``We haven't had any appreciable rain in the region since June
17,'' said Capt. Ray Wood, a New York state park ranger.
   Southwestern Virginia has begun suffering drought conditions,
and officials concerned that it was spreading scheduled a meeting
Wednesday.
   Connecticut dairy and poultry farmers were hurting because the
price of feed grain has risen astronomically, according to Gabe
Moquin, spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Agriculture.
   The drought is also posing a threat to the least tern, an
endangered species that nests on sand islands in the Mississippi,
said Jim Czarnezki, a biologist with the Missouri Department of
Conservation.
   ``The islands are now attached to the mainland, and the nests
are being destroyed by land predators,'' he said. ``And now the
islands also are accessible by all-terrain vehicles.''
   Emma Yates, of Lexington, Ky., found an inventive way to comply
with water restrictions by catching air-conditioner drip to water
her roses.
   With the National Weather Service predicting hot weather and no
rain in sight, truck farmers and gardeners in the Northeast were
trying to cope.
   ``We only got half a dozen rows of cauliflower, and those didn't
have much of a head. They were real small, some not big enough to
cut,'' said Fred Vollmer, who arms 80 acres of vegetables north of
Syracuse, N.Y.
   And it's been a slow summer for George Yund, who operates a
lawn-mowing business in Albany, N.Y.
   ``We can't mow because the grass doesn't grow,'' Yund said.

   A lightning-sparked fire in Utah's Zion National Park spread out
of control to 1,100 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters
hold the line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other
major fires in Wyoming.
   Gusty winds spread a third Wyoming fire over 400 acres of the
Bridger-Teton National Forest and forced the evacuation of a
campground and summer cabins on Freemont Lake, a half mile from the
blaze.
   A fire that scorched 1,130 acres in and around the Hiawatha
National Forest in Michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe.
   Hundreds of small grass and brush fires were reported over the
July 4 weekend, some caused by fireworks, in various parts of the
country.
   ``The Fourth of July holiday really contributed to the
problem,'' said Capt. Ray Wood, regional ranger for the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation in the Hudson Valley.
``Fireworks were touching off fires all over the place. Last night
it sounded like every fire alarm in the area was going off.''
   In California, a fireworks-caused blaze that swept over 2,200
acres near Yosemite National Park was declared contained at dawn
Tuesday.
   ``We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket,''
said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Forestry.
   By Monday, $384,000 had been spent to combat the fire, she said.
Authorities will try to recover that money, said Pat Kaunert of the
U.S. Forest Service.
   More than 670 firefighters from federal, state and local
agencies cut trails in the rugged terrain by hand and used
airplanes to drop fire retardant, officials said.
   Kentucky's Division of Forestry reported 85 fires burned 1,267
acres in the first four days of July, compared to an average of 18
fires and 165 acres for the whole month, spokesman Richard Green
said. About 40 weekend timber fires were attributed to fireworks.
   But Dwight Barnett, a spokesman for the Tennessee Division of
Forestry, said there were 26 wildland fires on the Fourth of July,
which burned just 113 acres.
   ``We were very relieved to get through the weekend in such good
shape,'' he said, citing partly the care taken by people playing
with fireworks.
   In Utah, Chief Ranger Bob Andrew said the Zion blaze was ignited
by lightning June 19. It was allowed to burn in a small area, but
on Sunday wind to 60 mph spread the flames, and the fire nearly
doubled in size from early Tuesday to midday.
   No injuries or property damage was reported.
   The Montana fire burned in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness
Area in the south-central part of the state. Weekend rain helped
keep it from spreading outside the wilderness boundary, said fire
information Officer Jo Barnier in Billings. And a helicopter was
dropping water on the fire Tuesday afternoon.
   The fire has been burning since at least June 19 in the Custer
National Forest. Phil Jaquith, Beartooth District ranger for the
forest, said Forest Service policy is to allow wilderness fires to
burn unless they threaten trails or structures or are about to
spread outside the wilderness boundary.
   A day after rain beat down the flames of a 1,650-acre fire in
the Shoshone National Forest in northwest Wyoming, firefighters
were able to reinforce fire lines around the blaze in the absence
of strong winds. The lightning-sparked fire has been burning for
almost two weeks.
   Rain Monday night also calmed three fires in Yellowstone
National Park in the state's northwest corner.
   Park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said the ``fan fire'' in the
park's northwest corner had held at 1,800 acres, while two other
fires in the southern section of the park continued to burn over
about 90 acres. Because all three fires are in the backcountry no
efforts were being made to douse the flames, she said.
   The evacuation in the Bridger-Teton forest was a precaution and
the fire started to die down somewhat as temperatures dropped at
nighttime, forest spokesman Fred Kingwill said.
   The blaze apparently was sparked by fireworks over the holiday
weekend, Kingwill said.
   In Michigan, authorities concluded a hot exhaust pipe or exhaust
particles triggered the Upper Peninsula fire, said Mary Mumford,
spokeswoman for Hiawatha National Forest. The fire was declared
under control Monday.
   Firefighters also battled two smaller fires that broke out on
the Upper Peninsula Tuesday, burning 220 acres, Department of
Natural Resources spokesman Bob Heyd said.
   In California, about 190 firefighters battled a wildfire that
burned 350 acres of brush Tuesday across steep terrain in an area
of Los Padres National Forest untouched by fire in 64 years, said
Earl Clayton of the U.S. Forest Service.
   Rising humidity and cooler temperatures were checking the fire's
spread, he said. There were no injuries in the fire, which was
reported Tuesday afternoon.

   Prince Charles was the guest of a honor
at a dinner marking the 500th anniversary of Duke Humfrey's
Library, the oldest section of Oxford University's famed Bodleian
Library.
   The dinner Tuesday was the first held in the Radcliffe Camera,
another part of the library, since the prince regent of England,
the king of Prussia and the czar of Russia dined there in 1814 to
celebrate what they believed was Napoleon's final defeat.
   The dinner also launched the Bodleian's development campaign.
The library urgently needs money to finance the conservation of
books and manuscripts, and to introduce new information technology.
   The Bodleian houses more than 6 million books, yet does not have
either a full card catalogue system or a computer system.

   How did a nice guy like actor Michael Dorn,
who played an amiable Highway Patrol officer on ``CHiPs,'' end up
in the role of a fierce Klingon warrior on ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation?''
   ``I'm always playing nice guys _ nice cops, nice doctors. I want
to show a darker side,'' said Dorn, who plays the dead-serious Lt.
Worf on the syndicated television show.
   As a Klingon, Dorn's character has a proud warrior tradition,
but has to get along with his human shipmates on the starship
Enterprise.
   When Dorn landed the role in May 1987, he knew he and the rest
of the cast would have to live up to the legend of the first ``Star
Trek'' series.
   ``I went and asked the producers how they wanted the
character,'' he said. ``Did they want me to read any of the books
or magazines?
   ``They said, `Don't read any of that stuff. Make the character
your own.'''
   Apparently, he succeeded. His character got huge applause from
about 1,500 Trekkies who showed up at the opening of a ``Star

   Pop star Paul McCartney and his wife,
Linda, returned to his childhood home in northern England to film
guest roles for a TV comedy series.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. series is being shot on Elswick
Street near the Mersey River, where one of the former Beatle's
childhood friends used to live.
   ``I used to come here and go sunbathing in the back yard at
number 45 because my mate Ian James used to live there,'' McCartney
said Monday.
   The McCartneys, in Liverpool for the first time in four years,
will play themselves in the comedy series about an unemployed
Liverpool family.

   Academy award-winning actor Dr.
Haing S. Ngor is seeking support to establish a hospital for
refugees at the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Ngor, who was a physician before he fled Cambodia in 1979, said
Monday that he already had the money and the medical staff for the
project, and that the only thing delaying the hospital was approval
from the Thai government.
   He told a news conference that after his visit here he would
spend two weeks in Thailand meeting officials.
   Ngor is here on a week's visit at the invitation of the
Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia. The
organization's two-day forum on Southeast Asia begins today.
   Ngor won his Oscar for his work in ``The Killing Fields,'' which
was about the fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge and the
subsequent slaughter of millions. War continues to ravage the
Southeast Asian nation.
   Ngor, who is now a U.S. citizen, said that once Cambodia was
free and safe to return to, he would go back to help rebuild it,
but would not stay because of ``too many painful memories.''

   President Reagan says there's one question he
didn't get to ask Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during their
recent Moscow summit: whether he believes in God.
   ``I had that curiosity for a time because I was so surprised at
his use of the name God,'' Reagan said in the August issue of Life
magazine. ``And I couldn't figure how I could really get into a
one-on-one conversation with him, knowing where atheism stands in
their country.''
   The president said he never got the chance to ask, but a Soviet
interpreter said that Gorbachev's usage of God was ``commonplace.
It was just a form of expression: god with a small g.''
   Reagan said that, unlike other Soviet leaders he's met, with
Gorbachev ``you don't get any feeling of cunning.''
   ``He is himself _ no imitation of anyone that I've ever known,''
he said. ``He's straightforward.''

   Actor Ron Perlman says playing the beast
Vincent on television's ``Beauty and the Beast'' is ``so romantic
and heroic and poetic, it's like playing Hamlet every week.''
   ``This may just be the greatest role of my life,'' Perlman, 37,
said in the July 9 issue of TV Guide magazine.
   Perlman said he was amazed when he learned the role has made him
a sex symbol.
   ``More than 95 percent of the people who write to me are
women,'' he said. ``Their letters are filled with sexual
fantasies.''
   The actor whose half-man, half-beast character's love affair
with Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton) is unconsummated in the
show has received up to nine letters from one viewer.
   ``Women say that Vincent is the ultimate fantasy lover, someone
who asks nothing in return but gives 110 percent,'' Perlman said.
``He evokes deep unconscious feelings of longing for a connection
to someone who understands things on a very emotional level.''
   Perlman is married to fashion designer Opal Stone and has a
4-year-old daughter, Blake Amanda.

   A protest against the U.S. downing of a
civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf turned violent when 10
demonstrators from the mostly Iranian crowd attacked an
anti-Khomeini television commentator.
   Rafi Khachatour of Channel 18, a local station featuring ethnic
programs, suffered cuts and bruises to the face Monday from
protesters wielding placards and a cane taken from an elderly
woman, police and witnesses said.
   ``They were all over him. It was terrible,'' said a woman who
identified herself only as Khachatour's friend.
   Police arrested two men in front of the Federal Building in West
Los Angeles after the attack on Khachatour, widely known in the
Iranian community for his strong views against Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's government.
   Police booked Ali Sinaki, 34, and Seyeo Hashemi, 35, both of Los
Angeles, for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon in the
attack on Khachatour, said Sgt. Rick Walker.
   Demonstrators left shortly after the beating as about a dozen
police cars arrived. Protest organizers took no responsibility for
the beating and many denied knowing about it.
   Khachatour was listed in stable condition at UCLA Medical
Center, said a nursing supervisor who declined to give her name.
   The protesters, most Iranian nationals, marched and chanted in
English and Farsi in front of the Federal Building, located near
the University of California at Los Angeles and a popular spot for
anti-government demonstrations.
   Demonstrators chanted, ``U.S. Out of Persian Gulf,'' and carried
signs reading, ``We Condemn The U.S. Massacre of Civilian
Passengers,'' ``Iraqi Invasion, U.S. Aggression,'' and ``U.S. Out
of Muslim Land.''
   About half the women protesters wore chadors, the traditional
veiled body-length black gown worn in their homeland.
   ``Why were you there to begin with to get scared by that
jetliner?'' asked protester Soheil Mohases of Garden Grove. ``I
don't think the U.S. should even be there.''
   Motorists expressed disapproval by shouting obscenities and
gesturing at the protesters. At least two arguments nearly
developed into fistfights between protesters and angry passers-by.
   According to the Defense Department, the guided missile cruiser
USS Vincennes mistook the Iran Air Airbus for an Iranian F-14
fighter and the plane did not respond to radio warnings. The plane
was brought down Sunday by one of two missiles fired from the
Vincennes. All 290 aboard are believed to have died.
   ``It's a pack of lies,'' said Loraine Mirza of Los Angeles. ``I
think they will be shooting anything in sight. I think it was a
deliberate act.''

<HEAD>Teddy Bear Museum Opens In Shakespeare's Birthplace</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, England (AP) _ Tourists who tire of
Elizabethan relics can now concentrate on stuffed toys, thanks to
the opening of the National Teddy Bear Museum in this town where
playwright William Shakespeare was born.
   Museum director Gyles Brandeth said he chose to open the
exhibition on the Fourth of July in honor of President Teddy
Roosevelt, who became the namesake of the child's toy for refusing
to shoot a baby bear on a 1902 hunting trip.
   ``We've teddy bears of every shape and size from more than 20
different countries,'' said Brandeth.
   The museum, in a 16th-century building in the heart of
Stratford-upon-Avon, contains more than 1,000 teddy bears,
including replicas of Winnie-the-Pooh, Paddington and Rupert the
Bear, all childrens' storybook heroes.
   As well as famous bears, the museum houses bears belonging to
famous people, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's bear
Humphrey, and Opposition Labor leader Neil Kinnock's Iswlyn.

   At least 24 firefighters and
emergency medical personnel were taken to hospitals Monday night
after a fire at a swimming pool company released chlorine into the
air, officials said.
   The blaze at Turmart Pool Co. began about 7:30 p.m. and was
declared under control before 10 p.m. About 150 firefighters
battled the fire at its height.
   Officials evacuated a few homes as a precaution but no
structures were threatened, including a nursing home about 1,000
feet away from the plant, said a fire dispatcher who would not give
his name.
   A nursing supervisor at Freehold Area Hospital said 20 people,
mostly firefighters, were brought to the hospital with coughing,
burning eyes and chest pains.
   Four firefighters were brought to Kimball Medical Center with
similar symptoms, nursing supervisor Elizabeth Fister said.
   ``They seem to be OK,'' Ms. Fister said.
   Firefighters had not yet determined a cause for the blaze, the
fire dispatcher said.

   Two cranes and two bulldozers were working to right the six
railroad cars that tipped over following the derailment, police Lt.

   There were no injuries in the accident.
   By afternoon, four of the cars had been righted, but Goss said

<HEAD>Generic Foods: Where Are They Now?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No-name, plain-label generic products that
attracted cost-conscious consumers a decade ago when inflation was
surging are all but disappearing from most supermarkets.
   With inflation held to moderate levels, today's shoppers are
opting in many instances for store brands, which cost a little more
than generics but are touted as being a step up in quality.
   Generics ``definitely have declined very rapidly in popularity
over the last several years. They came on strong in the late 1970s
when inflation was very high,'' said Mike Rourke, a spokesman for
The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. of Montvale, N.J. ``People
were trading down, trying to get their food dollar to go farther,''
   Paul Bernish of the Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. agreed that
generics peaked in the years ``corresponding to high inflation and
unemployment. As the economy has improved ... their appeal has
waned.''
   Yet at some markets, where generics are still given special
emphasis, they continue to sell well.
   Mona Doyle, a Philadelphia-based market analyst, identified the
Pathmark chain in the Northeast as one at which generics continue
to sell well. ``If the store is willing to stand behind it in a big
way, the consumer is still willing to give it a shot,'' she said.
   Would generics return to popularity if inflation began taking a
bigger bite out of the American pocketbook?
   Oscar Katov of the Food Marketing Institute doubts it. Consumers
who have gone back to name brands have done so because they prefer
those products, he said. Where the difference is only a few
pennies, they're unlikely to return to the generics.
   Consumers still complain about prices and seek value, Doyle
said. But with many stores offering double-coupon values, shoppers
often can buy national brands for competitive prices.
   In addition, Doyle reported in her ``Shopper Report'' newsletter
for the supermarket industry that the image of store-brand products
is improving among consumers.
   ``Retailers have gotten the message that store brands don't have
to be an also-ran,'' she said.
   Pathmark's Robert Wunderle explains the downfall of generics at
other stores this way:
   Typically, he said, one chain initiated generics and remained
serious about them, while others offered the products on a ``me
too'' basis and haven't stuck with them.
   Like Pathmark, Lucky Stores, based in Dublin, Calif., continues
to report strong generic sales.
   ``We maintain a low price image, so we try to offer consumers a
selection to choose from. We carry generics, private labels and
name brand products,'' said spokeswoman Judy Decker.
   She said Lucky Stores still have as many as 200 generic items,
although that is down slightly from past years.
   Pathmark still carries about 350 items under its No Frills
label, Wunderle said, and 53 generics are the No. 1 selling items
in their product categories, he said.
   For example, Pathmark sells more 2-liter bottles of No Frills
cola than any other cola. The same is true for spaghetti, grape
jelly and peanut butter, Wunderle said.
   Elsewhere, the generics that have remained most popular appear
to be non-food items. Kroger's Bernish agreed that sales of that
company's generic-priced Cost Cutter line remain strongest in
non-food items such as paper products.
   Doyle also noted a change in the overall supermarket product
lineup in recent years.
   In the past, national brands have been the top of the line,
followed by store brands and then generics. Now, there is a new top
layer, the so-called ``boutique'' offerings of fresh salads,
specialty cheeses, deli sections and gourmet items.
   A Food Marketing Institute shopper survey in January found that
only 41 percent considered the presence of generics important in a
market. By contrast, 76 percent rated the presence of a deli,
bakery or fresh food area as important.
   ``At one time (generics) got up to 7 percent of sales, but now
they have waned dramatically,'' said Rourke, whose company operates
under such trade names as A&P, Compass Foods, Kohl's and Super
Fresh. ``Generics are now a very minor part of grocery sales, down
around 2 percent or less.''
   Gary Smith of Safeway, Inc., based in Oakland, Calif., said his
chain still carries a few generic products but for the most part
concentrates on its own Scotch Buy label.
   Today, he said, shoppers seem more interested in house brands
and so-called value-added brands which offer better quality without
the marketing costs associated with national brands.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Home Life: Tomato-Growing, Cooking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When questions of character came up last
year with revelations about then-Democratic presidential candidates
Gary Hart and Joseph Biden, the joke around the Massachusetts
statehouse was that Gov. Michael Dukakis planned a major
disclosure: he once bought a suit retail.
   ``Nope. Nope. Not true,'' replied Dukakis, sometimes known to be
tightfisted, when an aide told him of the joke. ``I've bought them
upstairs (not in the discount basement), but always on sale.''
   The incident provided one of the few glimpses that anyone gets
into Dukakis' life away from politics. The Democratic nominee-to-be
prefers to keep details of his home life private, and his campaign
office is hard-pressed to provide any material on the subject.
   The office has a mountain of clippings on Dukakis as governor;
it doesn't keep a file on the 54-year-old husband and father.
   There are a few details that are common knowledge, however.
Dukakis enjoys growing tomatoes in the front yard of his house and
every year plants a rose bush for his mother, Euterpe. He likes to
prepare Sunday breakfast and usually washes the dishes. And he
loathes large parties.
   ``Mike likes small groups. He's in so many big ones at work,''
said Richard Giesser, a longtime Dukakis friend and political ally.
``He enjoys the family. He likes to putter. He likes to grow
things. It's fun just to stand and chat with him while he prunes
the bushes.''
   Dukakis, whose net worth is at least $500,000, lives in a duplex
he bought less than 20 years ago for $25,000, drives a 5-year-old
Dodge and generally vacations at the homes of friends or family.
   On one vacation, Dukakis took along a book on Swedish land-use
planning.
   A non-smoker and a drinker of white wine only on rare occasions,
Dukakis is more likely to take a walk to the ice cream store than
attend a Brookline bash, according to Giesser.
   The presidential candidate is also not much of a television
watcher or moviegoer, although when his son John appeared on
several episodes of the television series ``Family Ties,'' Dukakis
and his wife, Kitty, tuned in.
   In his younger days, Dukakis was a regular jogger, but recently
he has taken up ``power walking'' with hand weights, a routine he
keeps up faithfully on the campaign trail. He also has played the
trumpet a few times on the trail, to the delight of photographers
covering the candidate.
   Ira Jackson, a former Dukakis cabinet member and family friend
for 25 years, said the candidate's jogging, tomato-growing, cooking
and cleaning indicates a man ahead of his time.
   ``He was jogging way before it was fashionable. He was gardening
long before it became a yuppie pursuit. He moved closer to the city
at a time when others were moving away. He's always cooked
breakfast and done the dishes long before women's liberation
dictated that husbands should do this,'' Jackson said.
   Family is a key concern for Dukakis, who put off Secret Service
protection for months to avoid possible disruptions.
   ``He's got a world within his family that he's largely shielded
from the public. That reveals part of Michael Dukakis that I find
encouraging,'' Jackson said.
   Before his son John (by Kitty's previous marriage) and his
daughters, Kara and Andrea, went off to college, Dukakis would be
home for dinner regularly. He would frequently return to work
afterward, but was faithful about attending dinner and he expected
the rest of the family to be there.
   John Dukakis called the dinners at home ``a compressed hour'' of
political discussion and debate.
   If Dukakis wins the presidency there will be no ``first family''
in the White House _ just Dukakis and Kitty. Andrea is interested
in publishing, and Kara has three years of college to complete at
Brown University.
   John has taken an intense interest in politics, running Dukakis'
southern campaign and is political director in California.
   ``My father always thought that I would eventually return to
politics,'' said John, who was pursuing an acting career when he
went to work for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. He says he is mulling a
run for political office in Brookline.
   The story of Dukakis' private life has its unhappy moments.
Dukakis' brother Stelian attempted suicide in 1951 and was killed
by a hit-and-run driver in 1973 as he rode his bicycle through
Brookline. The two brothers' relationship was sometimes stormy.
   Kitty was addicted to diet pills for 26 years, a habit she
kicked and acknowledged publicly last year as Dukakis' presidential
campaign got under way.
   The campaign has forced the couple to make some emotional
adjustments, according to Kitty.
   ``We were very lonely during the first six months of the
campaign. We were often 40 miles away in different hotels.''
   Now, she said, they are just happy to get some private time.
   ``We don't go to restaurants anymore. We don't go to movies even
if we have the time. ... We had some time at Cape Cod recently. ...
We did a lot of walking and just being together.''

   A teen-ager was shot and killed on a sidewalk
Monday, two youths were shot near an inner-city park and two others
died in gang-related shootings during the holiday weekend,
authorities said.
   Antwon Hill, 17, was pronounced dead at St. Francis Medical
Center after a gang-style drive-by shooting about noon Monday in
suburban Lynwood, about 10 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.
   Hill and a friend were standing on the sidewalk when a car
slowed and one of two occupants opened fire, said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Deputy Eric Smith.
   Later Monday, Independence Day revelers gathered at a city
swimming pool watched in horror as a carload of youths screaming
gang slogans roared through an alley bordering the pool, shooting
two youths as they went.
   A bullet passed through the neck of one victim and the hip of
another, said police Officer Tammy Havlovic. Both youths, whose
names weren't available, were in stable condition at Martin Luther
King-Drew Medical Center, she said.
   Santa Ana police Sgt. Collie Provence said Aburto Olympo, 18,
and passenger, Martin Ambriez, 23, were seated in Olympo's car
Sunday night when they got in an argument with a group of men
standing in Centennial Park, Provence said. The men drew guns and
fired numerous shots, striking Olympo in the head and Ambriez in
the lower torso, police said.
   Olympo died nearly four hours later at Fountain Valley Regional
Hospital and Medical Center and Ambriez was in stable condition,
said a nursing supervisor.
   Two bystanders were also wounded by the barrage of gunfire,
Provence said. Both suffered minor wounds to their arms and backs,
he said.
   No arrests were made.
   Earlier Sunday in Los Angeles, 31-year-old Melvin Turner was
shot from a passing car as he walked home. Detective Paul Mize said
he died at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital.
   While Turner was not a known gang member, the drive-by shooting
was typical of street gangs, he said.
   Police had made no arrests and no motive had been determined.

<TEXT>
   A $2.5 billion-a-year child care expansion
bill is finally beginning to inch its way through the congressional
maze, seven months after it was introduced as the answer to working
families' day-care woes.
   But the chances of a child care solution emerging from the 100th
Congress are dimming, as the end of the session nears with no sign
that lawmakers have mustered the political resolve to work out a
bipartisan approach.
   ``I'm not certain there's as much interest in passing a bill as
in creating a political issue,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, head
of a GOP task force on child care.
   Some of the dozens of interest groups backing the $2.5 billion
Act for Better Child Care, or ABC, are anxious to transform
election-year interest and rhetoric into a veto-proof child care
bill before Congress adjourns this fall. But others are urging
lawmakers to resist election-year compromises.
   Given the upcoming election, Tauke said, ``the easiest course
right now for many members is to coast along, respond favorably to
the groups, not offend anyone.''
   More than 100 child care bills are pending in Congress,
reflecting a high level of public concern over day-care
availability, quality and cost.
   Proposed federal policies range from tax credits for every
family with young children, pushed primarily by conservatives, to
the ABC bill championed by Democrats and over 100 groups
representing children, women, labor, medical personnel and others.
   The ABC bill would make money available only to providers that
meet minimum national standards on health, safety, staff size and
training. Three-quarters of the money would help pay day care
expenses for families making under 115 percent of a state's median
income. The rest would go for capital improvements, staff training
and salaries.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the leading conservative proponent of
new federal action, has introduced a bill giving states $250
million to improve or expand child care; $100 million for liability
pools; and $25 million for capital improvements. States would have
to develop and adopt their own standards.
   Democratic sponsors of the ABC bill, bucking the American Civil
Liberties Union, are rewriting the bill to make sure day-care
programs run by religious groups will be eligible for the new
federal money. The changes were sought by conservatives and church
groups.
   But on other points of conflict _ mandatory national day-care
standards, the relatively high-income families eligible for federal
assistance, the wide age range of the children states are permitted
to serve (well into the teens) _ key Democrats have indicated they
are inclined to stand firm.
   ``I'm not going to compromise the basic principles of the ABC
bill,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., Senate sponsor of the
measure, told a group of magazine writers last week.
   Republicans maintain any child care bill will need bipartisan
backing, whether this year or next, and a consensus is within reach
if only the Democrats will deal.
   ``It is frustrating to have to sit and wait until the next
Congress, until we get past the next election, because we could be
doing it (building a consensus) right now,'' said a GOP Senate aide
familiar with the proposals.
   ``If a bill had been passed this spring, as we had hoped it
might be, we could be appropriating funds right now. ... Instead,
we're sitting around waiting for people to decide they want a bill,
as opposed to an issue,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The House Education and Labor subcommittee on human resources
approved the ABC bill by voice vote last Thursday after rejecting a
series of Republican amendments. A full committee work session is
expected at the end of the month.
   Subcommittee chairman Dale Kildee, D-Mich., said he would like
to see the House to pass the ABC bill this year. But he predicted
the window of opportunity will still be open next year _ perhaps
even wider than it is now.
   ``Whoever is president next year will probably provide a better
climate for child care,'' said Kildee. ``You can't fall off the
floor.''
   A Labor Department report concluded there is no day-care crisis
in America, but said there are spot shortages in parts of the
country. President Reagan has not formally endorsed any bill and
Education Secretary William Bennett said in April that
administration officials were still debating various approaches.

   Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided a
much-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared
1,650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rainfall in
neighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller fires
there.
   Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze
that raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in
California over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day
fire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday
after the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
   About a quarter-inch of rain helped to keep the lightning-caused
Shoshone fire's growth to about 200 acres overnight, said fire
information officer Dave Damron. But the nearly quarter-inch of
rain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.
   The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrol
planned for Monday night.
   ``The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lower
humidities and conditions more favorable to burning,'' said Damron.
``But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforce
the lines and complete lines that we don't have yet.''
   Four 20-person firefighting crews from Colorado, Utah and South
Dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by Monday night, putting
the total number of firefighters at about 430.
   Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air,
Damron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers dropped
chemical retardant and water on the spreading flames. On the ground
firefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.
   Meanwhile at Yellowstone, park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said
that because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, no
firefighters were trying to douse the flames.
   Because of the fires, park officials Sunday had closed off some
areas, but Vanderbilt said Monday the rain had allowed the
reopening of the areas to hiking and camping.
   The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, near
Yosemite, was a ``bottle rocket,'' said the forest's spokeswoman,
Mary Hale.
   Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity,
reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon and
hoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning,
Hale said.
   The fire was the largest so far this year in the forest, which
was the scene of huge wildfires last summer.
   At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawatha
forest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said from
the national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich.
   ``We're going to start releasing crews from this fire,''
Bluedorn said. ``We'll continue to patrol the area to make sure we
didn't miss any hot spots.''
   Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeks
before the fire is extinguished.
   ``It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,''
he said.
   The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from national
forests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who were
shipped to Michigan's central Upper Peninsula to battle the
Hiawatha blaze, Bluedorn said.
   Forest Service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage to
the 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlands
burned after the fire broke out Friday afternoon, Bluedorn said.
   Investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause.

   U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf operate
under rules of engagement written in the Pentagon and designed to
prevent unexpected attacks on American warships, such the one on
the USS Stark last year that killed 37 servicemen.
   ``The No. 1 obligation of the commanding officer of a ship or
units is the protection of his own people,'' said the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, who argued that the
USS Vincennes did not overreact Sunday when it shot down an Iranian
jetliner carrying 290 people.
   The imperative for self-defense _ combined with the heavy
traffic in the gulf, the introduction there of advanced weapons
that allow adversaries to kill quickly from a great distance and
the large number of on-again, off-again combatants _ have produced
an explosive situation.
   Pentagon officials refuse to spell out publicly the rules of
engagement, the standing orders under which commanders are
authorized to open fire.
   But the commander of the Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, is
convinced he followed them, Pentagon sources say.
   Rogers sent a four-page message up the chain of command to Crowe
saying that, if anything, he waited too long to fire at the
airliner and would repeat his decision if faced again with the same
situation.
   Events and statements over the past 14 months give a fairly
detailed outline of when American forces are permitted to shoot.
   ``We can go on what is known as hostile intent. That is to say
if a fellow has a weapons system aimed at us and we have a pretty
high assurance that he going to shoot at us, we can take it out,''
the commander of U.S. forces in the region, Marine Corps Gen.
George B. Crist, told reporters last Thursday.
   Crowe said U.S. commanders ``do not have to be shot at before
responding,'' a condition that was made known in a notice to all
nations and parties involved in the gulf, including commercial air
carriers.
   Since the U.S. Navy increased its presence in the Persian Gulf
in the spring of 1987, and began to escort reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers last summer, Crowe said, ``We are, of course, constantly
surveying and reviewing not only the circumstances under which we
operate, but also the rules of engagement.''
   Until Sunday, the greatest loss of life in a single incident
involving the U.S. Navy in the gulf came from what was later
described as a mistaken attack by an Iraqi fighter which fired two
Exocet missiles into the unsuspecting cruiser USS Stark on May 17,
1987.
   The explosions and fire killed 37 American seaman and ended the
careers of the Stark's commander, Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, and other
senior officers, who were severely criticized and forced to retire.
   On Sunday, one of the Stark's former officers defended Rogers,
saying the Vincennes had no choice but to fend off what appeared to
be a attacking warplane.
   ``If the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward the
Vincennes while the Vincennes was engaging Iranian patrol boats ...
I'm not surprised this kind of thing would happen,'' said Basil E.
Moncrief.
   According to Crowe, Rogers followed what appeared to be
carefully laid out procedures. The sophisticated Aegis radar and
tracking system aboard the Vincennes, one of the most advanced
ships in the Navy, detected an aircraft approaching from Iranian
airspace at 10:47 a.m. local time (2:47 EDT), officials said.
   At the time, the Vincennes was exchanging fire with three
Iranian Boghammer gunboats, 43-foot-long vessels that Iran has used
to attack tankers, they said.
   ``One of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip,
particularly from a head-on target, to identify the type of
aircraft,'' said Crowe.
   If the Vincennes had a side view of the plane, or had more time,
it might not have mistaken the Airbus, which is 177 feet long, for
an F-14, which is 62 feet long, Pentagon officials said.
   The Vincennes broadcast three warnings on a civilian emergency
network, which airliners normally monitor, and four warnings on a
frequency normally monitored by warplanes, Crowe said.
   The approaching aircraft appeared to descend and accelerate, as
would a warplane preparing to launch an anti-ship missile, he said.
It was declared ``hostile'' four minutes after it was spotted by
radar. Three minutes later, when the plane was about nine miles
away, the American warship fired.
   One complication in the gulf, said Crist, is knowing who is
going to attack when. Since a naval battle last April in which the
United States sank one Iranian frigate and knocked another out of
action, Iran has ``been most circumspect.''
   ``They've been very careful not to antagonize us,'' he said.
``We had an (Iranian) F-4 come out the other day ... and our ships
challenged him, (and) he said, `I'm on my way to engage an Iraqi.'''

   A fast-moving express train slammed into
another passenger train that had halted in central Bombay, killing
at least two people and injuring more than 100, rescuers and
hospital officials said today.
   Press Trust of India put the death toll at five in the Monday
night crash.
   The Minar Express stopped shortly after leaving Bombay's
Victoria Terminal when someone pulled an emergency brake cord,
staffers at a railroad control room said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Siddeshwar Express, which left Victoria Terminal a few
minutes later, crashed into the rear of the stationary train,
overturning a sleeper car and another passenger car and derailing a
third car.
   Firefighters said they recovered two bodies and counted 85
injured people, but a check of several hospitals showed at least
104 had been treated or admitted for injuries suffered in the crash.
   At least three were listed in serious condition.
   The Minar Express was bound for Secunderabad, while the
Siddeshwar Express was headed for Sholapur. Both cities are
southeast of Bombay.
   Train service in and out of Bombay was delayed today as workmen
cleared the tracks.

   Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe
are looking closely at how the Navy awarded contracts for its Aegis
ship-defense system _ the type used by the USS Vincennes to shoot
down an Iranian passenger jet.
   Pentagon officials now find themselves defending the system's
capabilities, in addition to facing questions about the role of
private consultants in determining which defense contractors won
the multibillion-dollar Aegis production contracts.
   The Vincennes relied on its Aegis nerve system to track and
destroy an incoming aircraft on Sunday during hostilities with
Iran. The aircraft, mistaken for an Iranian F-14 attack plane,
turned out to be an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard.
   Aegis, named for the shield of the Greek god Zeus, combines
computers, radar and weapons in a protective net around Navy ships
like the Vincennes.
   Reps. Jim Florio, D-N.J., and H. James Saxton, R-N.J., have
called on the Defense Department to determine whether the Aegis
contracts are tainted by disclosures in the ongoing Pentagon
purchasing investigation.
   A chief target of the bribery probe is Melvyn Paisley, a former
assistant Navy secretary who oversaw division of the Aegis work.
Paisley left the Navy in 1987 to become a consultant to, among
others, a company that got Aegis work. Paisley, though his
attorney, has denied any wrongdoing.
   Aegis systems had been built for 15 years at RCA's Moorestown,
N.J., division when, in 1985, the Navy sought production changes
despite the system's then-stellar reputation.
   Unisys Corp. of Detroit eventually was awarded a contract to
begin work on a key radar component.
   Unisys spokesman William Beckham confirmed that Paisley was
hired by the company as a consultant after he left the Navy, but
said he did not offer advice directly on Aegis.
   Beckham said another Unisys consultant, William Galvin,
``monitored'' the Aegis proposals.
   Investigators reportedly are looking at links between Paisley
and Galvin, and federal records show that Paisley's wife had a
$50,000 ownership share in a company associated with Galvin.
   Then-Navy Secretary John Lehman had a simple explanation for his
order to ``second-source'' some of the work: Congress had told him
to do so. Congress had required second sources on military work in
an effort to spark competition.
   ``I have yet to meet a second source I didn't like,'' Lehman
scribbled at the bottom of a May 1985 letter defending the shift.
   But despite the goal of increasing competition, the Navy
announced that it would transfer the radar work without competitive
bidding _ to the Sperry Corp. of Great Neck, N.Y., now part of
Unisys.
   New Jersey legislators rallied to protect some 600 jobs at RCA
and as many as 5,000 related positions. Saxton wrote to colleagues
at the time that ``RCA has been on time, below cost and has
exceeded all performance goals.''
   The New Jersey group suspected that Rep. Joseph Addabbo, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, was
behind the plans _ trying to get the Aegis work for his home state.
Addabbo died in 1986.
   ``They clearly muscled their way in through Joe Addabbo,'' said
Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J.
   As originally proposed, the Aegis competition was to include
dividing both the work on developing and making the systems' nearly
900 major components, as well as the delicate task of putting the
parts together.
   Aegis' 6 million parts and 4,900 cables are weaved together at
RCA's $141 million ``cruiser of the cornfields,'' a mock warship in
a rural area along the New Jersey Turnpike.
   The New Jersey delegation eventually collected enough
congressional muscle to fend off part of the Navy's plans. Lehman's
successor, James Webb, announced the Aegis assembly work would
remain at RCA.
   But plans to split work on Aegis components continued. Paisley
in June 1986 ordered subordinates to implement the changes within
four months.
   The trade journal Defense News reported Monday that RCA
executives complained bitterly to Paisley, and that he told them
they could expect a quid-pro-quo share of a separate $2.4 billion
submarine electronics system.
   Defense News quoted an RCA spokesman and Paisley's lawyer as
denying the report, which it attributed to sources speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In October 1987, seven months after Paisley had left the Navy,
the service informed the Armed Services panel that Unisys _ now one
of Paisley's clients _ was the sole bidder to compete with RCA.
   In January 1988, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les
Aspin withdrew his objections to splitting the Aegis component work
between RCA and Unisys. With that, congressional resistance
crumbled.

   Soviet inspectors prepared to head home after completing their
looks Monday at defense sites in the United States under the new
nuclear arms treaty.
   The head of a Soviet team that inspected a defense plant in San
Diego hailed the cooperative effort as unprecedented, and
congratulated Americans celebrating the anniversary of their
country's independence.
   The Soviets sent teams to make ``baseline inspections'' at five
missile storage sites in four states over the Fourth of July
weekend. While Soviet inspectors were in California, Colorado, Utah
and Arizona, American teams visited Soviet missile facilities in
Warsaw Pact nations for the On-Site Inpections Agency under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The inspections are designed to verify the exact number of
missiles and related components to be destroyed within the next
three years.
   Vyacheslav Kharlamov led a 10-member Soviet team that completed
a grueling 24-hour inspection Monday of San Diego's General
Dynamics plant, which until last December made cruise missile
launchers.
   ``Together with representatives of the OSIA and with cooperation
of representatives of the plant, the first unprecedented action was
fulfilled in verification of the compliance with the obligation
under the treaty between the U.S.S.R and the U.S,'' Kharlamov said
through an interpreter. ``We will take note of the U.S. authorities
to ensure the fulfillment of the inspection according to the
provisions of the INF treaty.''
   After reviewing their findings with a 10-member group of
Americans that escorted them, the Soviets boarded an Air Force
C-141 transport plane and departed for Travis Air Force Base near
San Francisco.
   ``Today on the national day of your country we go back to San
Francisco and, after a short rest, we will return to Moscow,''
Kharlamov said. ``We like to extend our congratulations on your
national day.''
   In Pueblo, Colo., 10 Soviet inspectors inventoried U.S. Pershing
missiles at an Army depot.
   Depot spokeswoman Mary Wilson said the Soviets were very
friendly, but said she couldn't comment on their observations or
the inspection itself.
   Wilson said the Pueblo site was the only one subject to
unlimited inspection by the Soviets under the pact implemented this
year.
   She said high-technology machines and weapons at the Pueblo
depot remained under wraps, but the Soviet team was entitled to
look under the covers to see if they were hiding missile parts.
   At Dugway Proving Ground, a remote Army installation in the
western Utah desert, 10 Soviet treaty inspectors completed their
visit, wrote reports and changed clothes before departing for
Travis Air Force Base Monday, said spokeswoman Kathy Whittaker.
   Under the treaty, the Soviets could return to San Francisco or
move to another site open to inspection. They were not required to
say what they would do before boarding the departure aircraft.
   ``From our end of it, we were able to provide them with the
opportunity to see what they wanted to and inspect all inspectable
areas on the post,'' Whittaker said.
   Soviet teams departed Monday after concluding inspections of two
Arizona military bases' facilities for ground-launched cruise
missiles.
   An Air Force transport picked up one 10-man team of Soviets at
the Army's Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, then picked up another
8-member Soviet team at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson.
   Some 70 Soviet inspectors arrived at Travis late Friday before
fanning out to sites eligible for inspections under the treaty.
   A group of 22 inspectors who headed to the Hercules Aerospace
Co. missile plant in Magna, Utah, will be the only permanently
based Soviets, and can stay up to 13 years under the treaty. The
other 48 inspectors were to leave at midday Tuesday.

   As Washington scandals go, the furor of the
summer of 1890 was small potatoes, or perhaps small oats.
   The scandal broke in the aftermath of the attempt by Sen. Isham
Green Harris, a Tennessee Democrat, to create a new position on the
Senate staff _ superintendent of the Senate stables.
   As Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas told the story
last week, Harris's move was successfully blocked by Sen. Eugene
Hale, a Maine Republican.
   Hale contended the Senate stables already had three employees
for each horse and did not need another.
   But that did not end the matter, Dole told the Senate.
   An enterprising newspaper reporter decided to investigate.
Inspecting the stables, the reporter found nine official ``Senate
horses.''
   Five were used to pull Senate wagons.
   Four were for the use of the so-called riding pages who carried
senators' messages around Capitol Hill.
   But those were not the only horses in the Senate stables. The
stables boarded 13 other equines as well.
   Six were the personal steeds of U.S. senators.
   Two belonged to members of the House of Representatives.
   Five were owned by various congressional officials.
   Membership in the Senate stables, it turned out, had its
benefits.
   The reporter acknowledged that the owners of the non-Senate
horses did pay $12 a month for their feed.
   But, he discovered, there was no charge for the other
necessities of a horse's life.
   ``The brushes, currycombs, cloths and labor are all taken care
of on the Senate payroll,'' he declared.
   The reporter did a cost survey of the capital's public stables
and discovered that a non-senatorial citizen would pay an average
$20 a month for all the currying and pampering given to horses
boarded in the Senate stables.
   ``It is perfectly plain,'' the reporter wrote, ``that the man
who is privileged to keep his horses in this stable can save the
price of a pretty good horse _ say $100 in a year.''
   The investigation continued and the reporter dug out the names
of the officeholders boarding personal horses in the Senate
stables, partially at public expense.
   Leading the list was a familiar name _ Sen. Isham Harris, who
had proposed appointing a superintendent to manage the Senate
stables in the first place.
   Ninety eight years later the Senate has neither horses nor a
stable to keep them in.
   But it is not without transportation.
   A rank of shiny, black, late-model executive automobiles is
parked each day near the foot of the Senate steps ready to whisk
the current set of senators around the capital city.

   An explosion of fireworks on the ground
Monday night started several small fires at a downtown park on Lake
Superior, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people
attending a Fourth of July display.
   One spectator was burned slightly and was taken to a hospital,
said police officer Kevin McKenna.
   ``Everything went flying any which way,'' the officer said.
   The incident occurred about 10 p.m., about one-third of the way
through the show, McKenna said.
   The explosion started several small fires at Bayfront Park on
Lake Superior. A nearby warehouse being used by a construction
company also caught fire, McKenna said.
   A charge failed to lift one of the fireworks out of its
canister, setting off a chan reaction that blew up 20 minutes worth
of fireworks within two minutes, said Guy Gustafson of Arrowhead
Inc. of Duluth, the company that put on the show at Bayfront Park.
He blamed faulty wiring.

<HEAD>Removing `Greenhouse' Gases Could Double Electricity Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Removing power plant and factory emissions
causing the ``greenhouse effect'' that is warming the Earth is
technically possible, but it could double the production cost of
electricity in some areas, according to one study.
   Coal accounts for a large share of the greenhouse warming
because it forms carbon dioxide when burned _ all fossil fuels
containing carbon do, coal more than others.
   Carbon dioxide, in turn, accounts for half of the manmade gases
that scientists say have warmed the Earth by one degree Fahrenheit
over the past century, will make 1988 the warmest year on record
and could add as much as another eight degrees by late in the next
century. Such a development would make droughts and heat waves much
more frequent in the American Midwest and South.
   During a June 23 Senate Energy Committee hearing, a panel of
scientists reported that the warming has started. The report
especially disturbed coal-state lawmakers such as Sen. Wendell
Ford, D-Ky., who said, ``I'm trying to find a way to use a resource
we have.''
   Coal accounts for 80 percent of the fossil fuel used to generate
electricity in the United States. That generation accounts for 30
percent of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions, and the United
States in turn contributes about 30 percent of world carbon dioxide.
   No ``clean burning'' technology can avoid the formation of
carbon dioxide from fossil fuels: burning is simply the reaction of
carbon with oxygen that transforms both to carbon dioxide.
   But carbon dioxide can be ``scrubbed'' from smokestacks, where
it forms about 9 percent to 13 percent of gases from a fossil-fuel
power plant.
   The higher the concentration, the easier the scrubbing _ a fact
that Washington consultant Leon Green Jr. made use of in proposing,
in general terms, using heat from nuclear fuel to gassify coal and
collect carbon dioxide.
   The easily recovered CO2 could be used in greenhouses, to
enhance crop growth and to make fertilizers, according to a
proposal Green sketched at the February meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. However, Green could
not yet say whether his carbon dioxide recovery system would be
feasible.
   One system that has been analyzed more extensively was developed
by chemical engineers Hsing C. Cheng and Meyer Steinberg of the
Energy Department's Brookhaven, N.Y., National Laboratory. They
designed a system using a solvent to dissolve 90 percent of the
carbon dioxide out of a plant's exhaust gases.
   Their plan calls for use of the plant's waste heat energy to
remove carbon dioxide from the solvent and liquify it.
   Cheng and Steinberg envisioned a network of pipelines to carry
liquid carbon dioxide from power plants to the ocean or to
abandoned oil and gas wells and salt caverns. In the ocean, the
liquid would either rest on the ocean floor or be dissolved in the
water, depending on the system selected. In some areas, the oil
industry might buy the carbon dioxide to inject into oil fields to
keep up well pressures.
   Power required to run the system would amount to 11 percent to
16 percent of the generating capacity of the nation. But the system
could reduce the annual amount of carbon dioxide added to the
atmosphere worldwide by 10 percent if the United States used it and
30 percent if all nations did.
   ``However, the cost ... is significant when evaluated in light
of its benefit,'' Cheng and Steinberg said in a 1986 paper.
``Overall, the CO2 control system could essentially increase the
capital investment of power plants by 70 percent to 150 percent,
and increase the production cost of electricity by 56 percent to
100 percent, depending on the location of the plant.''
   Using 1980 data, Cheng and Steinberg calculated that the control
system could cost $284 billion dollars _ which could be $330
billion at 1987 prices.
   ``The percentages would not change very much,'' Cheng said in a
telephone interview.
   ``This seems not feasible in the light of energy efficiencies
that are possible,'' Cheng said. ``I still think the best way to
reduce the greenhouse effect is through energy efficiencies, though
it's very difficult to single out which (economic) sector should be
tackled first.''
   Although energy efficiency has been improving by 2.5 percent per
year for more than a decade, the United States still takes twice as
much energy to produce a dollar's worth of economic activity as
Germany and Japan do.

<HEAD>U.S. Facilities Tighten Security After Iranian Jet Downed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM MINEHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   U.S. missions and overseas companies tightened security and
toned down Fourth of July celebrations in response to the downing
of an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. London airport
authorities removed American flags.
   Governments around the world deplored the deaths of the 290
people who were aboard the plane and said the disaster should
intensify efforts to end to the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The United States said U.S. Navy officers thought the Iran Air
jetliner was a fighter that ignored seven warnings when they shot
it down Sunday during a skirmish in the Persian Gulf.
   Iran called for all-out war in retaliation.
   ``The United States government believes that the risk of Iranian
terrorist actions directed against U.S. diplomatic, military and
commercial facilities, as well as U.S. airlines and merchant ships,
has increased appreciably,'' said a statement telexed from the U.S.
Embassy in Brussels to American firms around Belgium.
   ``It is further believed that these actions will be deliberately
designed to cause U.S. fatalities ... or spectacular destructions
of U.S. official or commercial facilities.''
   At Heathrow Airport outside London, police armed with submachine
guns patrolled the terminals. Baggage loaded onto American airlines
came under close scrutiny because of fears of Iranian reprisals.
   Authorities removed American flags put up in honor of the Fourth
of July in a terminal that services most U.S. flights. An airport
statement said it was ``a mark of respect'' for those who died.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, additional guards were deployed at Arlanda
Airport near the service counters of U.S. air carriers.
   Americans in the gulf region observed Independence Day by going
to work as usual, except for embassy staffs, who had the day off.
   The 20,000 U.S. citizens in the gulf Arab states were advised to
maintain low profiles, and Navy officials canceled leaves and shore
passes for U.S. servicemen as a precaution against possible
terrorist acts.
   In Jutland, Denmark, the annual American-Danish friendship
festival on Independence Day drew only 9,000 people, compared to
double that number in previous years.
   Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
said the attack ``shows American naval officers were not very
competent, or to use an American phrase, trigger-happy.''
   He said the incident proved that American actions in the region
were dangerous and demanded: ``U.S. naval forces must immediately
leave the waters of the Persian Gulf.''
   On Sept. 1, 1983, Soviet fighters shot down a Korean jetliner
and all 269 people aboard were killed. Gerasimov said the Korean
plane was over a ``strategically sensitive'' area of the Soviet Far
East while the Iranian jet was ``flying only over its own territory
and territorial waters.''
   The Soviet Union denounces Sunday's attack but will not follow
the ``bad example'' of ``wild'' American criticism after the 1983
event, he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel expressed sorrow about
the loss of life but said the incident ``is one of the side effects
of hostile actions. There is no room for condemning anyone.''
   Zeev Schiff, a respected Israeli military analyst, said on
Israel radio that the incident should ``raise questions among the
Americans about their criticism of others in similar
circumstances.''
   The British government supported the U.S. explanation for the
attack, but Conservative lawmaker Robert Adley called the Americans
``trigger-happy.''
   ``They are burdened with this massive firepower but they still
have not learned the lessons of the Vietnam War,'' he said.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua accused the Reagan
administration of ``committing a true genocide.''
   ``This crime joins those committed against the Nicaraguan
people, evidence of the total scorn for international law and
betrayal of the ideals of those who fought and died for the
independence of the United States,'' Ortega said.
   Vatican radio called it an ``absurd tragedy'' in which innocent
people paid ``the price of a never-ending conflict that has already
sowed so much death and destruction. ... The possibility of tragic
errors, that add themselves to the destructive iniquities of war,
is particulary worrisome.''
   Japan, which gets slightly more than half its oil from the
Persian Gulf, appealed for an early and peaceful end to the war.
   ``Our country ... considers it extremely regrettable that
valuable lives were lost and express our heartfelt condolences to
the victims and their bereaved family members,'' government
spokesman Keizo Obuchi said.
   Japan Air Lines said its twice-weekly flight from Tokyo to
Athens, Greece, would alter its route over the gulf to avoid the
area where the shooting took place.
   In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways said the daily Hong Kong to
London flight also would alter its route over the gulf.

   For the first time in 2{ years a
space shuttle is on a launch pad here, and engineers and
technicians are grooming it for an engine test crucial to the
ship's return to space in early September.
   Preparations for the engine firing began shortly after Discovery
reached the launch pad Monday and workers had hooked up electrical,
environmental control and other connections.
   The July 24 test is to subject the three main liquid fuel
engines to a 19.4-second ignition while Discovery is bolted firmly
on its launch mounts. The exercise will check scores of engine
modifications and provide the launch team with countdown practice.
   Discovery rolled to Launch Pad 39B on a Fourth of July filled
with emotional outpourings from officials, thousands of space
workers and one of the astronauts who will fly on the first shuttle
mission since the Challenger disaster in January 1986.
   ``America, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut Dave Hilmers
told about 2,000 Kennedy Space Center workers who cheered as the
spaceship moved out of an assembly hangar to start the 4.2-mile
trip to the pad.
   ``It's been a long 2{ years since Challenger, and I'm very
pleased with the progress we've made during that time,'' center
director Forrest S. McCartney told the crowd. ``It's been a team
effort. ... This is a proud day.''
   McCartney presented Hilmers with a book containing the
signatures of more than 15,000 center personnel who have labored to
return the shuttle to flight. The book will be carried into space
aboard Discovery.
   Shortly after the shuttle reached the launch pad, center gates
were opened to permit space workers to bring their families out on
the holiday for a drive by the launch pad and a close look.
   More than 4,000 cars, with an average of four people in each,
passed through, creating a huge traffic jam, with lines stretching
to 18 miles at times. For some, the drive to the pad took nearly
two hours, but no one seemed to mind once they saw the shuttle
standing majestically in the sunlight.
   ``Wonderful!'' ``It's great!'' ``We're back in business,'' were
among the comments as drivers slowed to allow their passengers to
take photographs.
   The launch-pad firing of Discovery's engines is the next major
milestone along the route to orbit.
   The next day, July 25, the shuttle's other propulsion system,
the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket, will undergo its final
pre-flight test at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah.
   Both tests are considered essential to the shuttle's return to
space.
   A faulty booster rocket joint led to the explosion of Challenger
and loss of its seven crew members on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The move to the launch pad ends several months of frustration
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle
program. Four launch dates, starting with last February, have been
set and then postponed, with the space agency announcing the latest
delay last week, a slip from late August to early September.
   Astronaut Rick Hauck will command an all-veteran crew of shuttle
fliers on the four-day Discovery mission, whose main tasks will be
deployment of a communications satellite and checking more than 200
orbiter modifications. The other crew members are pilot Dick Covey
and mission specialists Mike Lounge, George Nelson and Hilmers.

   Vice President George Bush calls the Navy's
destruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard ``an
unhappy incident,'' but says it won't lead to changes in U.S.
policy.
   ``Life goes on,'' Bush said Monday. ``Our mission goes on and
the world keeps turning.''
   Bush said a more thorough study of the tragedy is needed before
deciding if U.S. reparations to families of the deceased will be
offered.
   Speaking with reporters on Air Force II as he returned from July
4th campaign appearances in three Midwestern cities, Bush voiced
concern about possible Iranian retaliation.
   ``I don't know what they'll do,'' he said, but ``we can't be
deterred by threats.''
   Asked whether he was concerned that rising anti-American
sentiment in the area over the incident might further endanger
hostages held in Lebanon, Bush said: ``I worry about the hostages
being held in the first place.''
   ``Those people took revenge on society by taking the hostages in
the first places,'' he said.
   The vice president said he planned to meet today with President
Reagan on the episode. He had no public appearances scheduled.
   At an Independence Day celebration on the banks of the
Mississippi River in St. Louis on Monday, Bush was applauded when
he said that the captain of the Navy warship Vincennes ``did what
he had to do.''
   Later, during an air show as military jets swooped overhead,
Bush told reporters that he felt the people who applauded were
mainly displaying patriotism.
   ``I think people respond to that, they understand that and
they're right, as a matter of fact,'' he said.
   ``It's just an unhappy incident. We expressed our proper
regrets. It appears that the captain acted appropriately. ... We're
not going to change our policy because of this unfortunate
incident.''
   On the issue of possible financial compensation to families of
the dead, Bush said: ``I don't know. Let's look into the whole
thing, understand it more fully, before reaching any conclusions of
that nature.''
   He told a festival crowd in Elmwood Park, Ill., a Chicago
suburb, that ``I probably speak for all when I say we regret the
loss of innocent life in the gulf.''
   ``But as I listen to the description of the chief of naval
operations about what happened there, I can identify with the
dilemma faced by the captain of the USS Vincennes.''
   Bush said the captain did not want to put his crew ``more in
harm's way. He gave seven times warning. And it's regrettable that
life was lost but he was doing what he had to do.''

   An elderly farmer wearing a helmet and a
bulletproof vest opened fire on police and set fire to their
headquarters, wounding two and forcing authorities to transfer 140
inmates to state lockups.
   ``It put us out of business,'' Orangeburg County Sheriff C.R.
Smith said of Monday morning's attack.
   Clyde B. Myers of Branchville, shot six times by police, was in
fair condition today at Orangeburg-Calhoun Regional Hospital, said
a spokeswoman who refused to give her name. Two officers suffered
minor gunshot wounds in the fray.
   Warrants will be issued charging Myers, 67, with arson and
assault and battery with intent to kill, Smith said, adding that
the motive for the attack was unknown.
   The law enforcement complex, which houses a jail, the sheriff's
department and the city police department in this community of
15,000 people 40 miles south of Columbia, suffered serious damage.
   Myers, wearing the vest and steel helmet, crashed his old farm
truck through gates at the center, entered through the back door
and fired a shotgun, Smith said.
   ``Our officers returned fire,'' he said.
   Myers returned to his truck and got some gasoline. The truck had
two 500-gallon tanks, but the sheriff was unsure how much gas they
held.
   Myers poured gasoline around the gates and set it on fire,
barricading himself between the truck and a wall, Smith said.
   A 20-minute gunbattle ensued, with three state Highway Patrol
troopers helping an unspecified number of officers.
   The tanks on the truck ignited, and the building eventually
caught fire, Smith said.
   ``After it burned a few minutes, it got too hot for him,'' Smith
said. ``He attempted to come out. ... When he did, he stumbled.
That's when our officers rushed him and were able to subdue him.''
   Myers suffered gunshot wounds to the right hand, right foot,
right shoulder, right hand, right groin and left elbow. He also
sufffered burns to his left hand and back.
   Deputy Sheriff Allen Bright, shot in the forearm, and sheriff's
Detective Everette LaFrance, shot in a finger on his right hand,
were treated at a hospital and released.
   After Myers was subdued, firefighters were able to get to the
blaze, but not before it destroyed the front office, jail offices
and communications room, Smith said. The rest of the building
suffered serious smoke damage.
   The 140 prisoners in the jail were unharmed, but had to be moved
to state Department of Corrections facilities. Law enforcement
officers were working out of an office in the county courthouse.
   Myers had been involved in property and right-of-way disputes
with county officials, Smith said. In December 1985, he refused to
leave a county council meeting, chaining himself to a chair with
two locks, an ankle brace and a chain.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Nationalist Party convenes a
crucial congress Thursday that is expected to elevate a new
generation of leaders and determine the pace for more social and
political liberalization.
   The 13th party congress is seen as a watershed in Taiwan's
political development. Government initiative has virtually halted
pending its outcome.
   ``Everything has stopped except the pollution and the traffic,''
leading political journalist Antonio Chiang joked in a recent
interview.
   The congress will differ greatly from past gatherings dominated
by strongmen from the Chiang Kai-shek family, whose unquestioned
supremacy in the Nationalist Party dates back six decades.
   The last congress, seven years ago, was run by the late
President Chiang Ching-kuo, eldest son of the World War II leader.
   Though Chiang Ching-kuo died in January, his legacy will be very
much alive at the congress as delegates consider how fast and how
far to go with the political and social change he began.
   In his final years, Chiang ended 38 years of martial law,
allowed the formation of opposition parties and opened the door to
unofficial contact with arch-enemy China. Many media taboos that
prevented critical reporting of government leaders and policies
also have disappeared.
   Taiwanese have staged more than 1,500 demonstrations in the past
year, most of them peaceful, to protest a wide variety of
government policies. The number of protests has declined, however,
since police cracked down on a May 20 riot and detained nearly 100
people.
   Some observers believe the protests indicate that expectations
for change have increased and social unrest could result if the
Nationalists do not maintain a quick pace of liberalization.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party wants to scrap the
political system that ensures the Legislature and electoral college
remain controlled by aging Nationalists who do not face elections.
The government has promised to open more seats to elections, but
has yet to announce details.
   Many Taiwanese also want changes in economic and financial
policies they claim favor big business.
   The congress is expected to retire some old-guard party
conservatives from the Nationalist leadership clique that fled to
Taiwan in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek after losing a civil war to the
Communists on the Chinese mainland.
   ``The whole power structure will be much younger,'' predicted
Chang Chung-tung, professor of history at the National Taiwan
University.
   Elderly Nationalists from the Chinese mainland still dominate
the party's 31-member policy-making Central Standing Committee, but
as many as half are expected to step down.
   Native Taiwanese, who comprise about 85 percent of the island's
nearly 20 million people, hold about one-third of committee seats,
but that proportion should increase.
   The new committee could determine how much leeway President Lee
Teng-hui, the first Taiwan-born leader of the Nationalist
government, will have to push forward his own programs for change.
   Lee, 65, who was named acting party chairman two weeks after
Chiang's death, is expected to be confirmed chairman at the
congress.
   The 2.4 million-member Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, was
founded on mainland China in 1894 by Sun Yat-sen, regarded as the
father of modern China for his role in toppling the Manchu Qing
dynasty in 1911.
   Power in the Kuomintang, which in structure resembles the
Chinese Communist Party, traditionally has flowed from the top
down. The party was dominated first by Sun, then by Chiang Kai-shek
and most recently by Chiang Ching-kuo.
   This year's party congress not only lacks a strongman
personality but for the first time will include delegates not
handpicked by Nationalist officials.
   Premier Yu Kuo-hwa and other top government officials, for the
first time in their careers, have had to campaign across the island
to drum up support for their top-level positions.
   In recent newspaper interviews, Yu vowed to push for
privatization of public banks and some state-run companies and
promised to recruit younger Cabinet members.
   Expected to play a vocal role at the congress are the so-called
``Young Turk'' legislators who won elections held in 1986 for the
Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's lawmaking body.
   Forty of the Taiwan-elected lawmakers issued a statement June 24
urging the party to map out a ``positive and forward-looking''
policy toward China and to adopt a ``realistic attitude to promote
more exchanges and contacts.''
   They demanded the 1,209 voting congress delegates decide the
party's China policy instead of rubber-stamping a resolution handed
down by the Central Standing Committee.

   Hugh and Ann Alley were looking for
some barnyard pets after they got out of the cattle business when
they stumbled onto something small.
   The couple have five miniature Sicilian donkeys that stand 34
inches tall or less. Any taller than 36 inches, and they wouldn't
be considered miniature. Regular donkeys can grow to 52 inches,
Alley said.
   ``Ours are no more than big dogs,'' Alley said recently.
``Everyone says dogs are man's best friend. A donkey would have to
be second.''
   ``They like to be loved,'' Mrs. Alley said. ``They drink iced
tea. We bring them in the house and they mind real good. They're
jealous if one gets more love than the other one. We've had more
company than we've ever had in our life. People come from all over
to make their picture.''
   ``They just care so much for you. They'll put their head in your
lap like a dog,'' Mrs. Alley said.
   The retired Church Hill couple was looking for a barnyard pet
last year after they got out of the cattle business and leased most
of their 64-acre farm. They decided on a burro and began to look
for one when they contacted a West Virginia woman who breeds the
miniature donkeys.
   The tidbit donkeys are a big hit with the neighbors and make
regular appearances in parades dressed in costumes. The couple also
takes them to nursing homes and schools, including a school for the
blind.
   ``One blind boy just fell in love,'' Alley said. ``He walked
over this donkey with his fingers like he was playing the piano.''

   A year ago, Jay Green vowed that he would not
taste defeat again. Instead, he tasted sweet victory _ and spicy
hot dogs.
   Green swallowed 10 hot dogs and rolls in 12 minutes to defeat 12
other contestants Monday at the Nathan's Famous 72nd annual Hot
Dog-Eating Contest. Last year, the 30-year-old manager of a
limousine service came in second.
   ``In the newspapers, I vowed that I would win this year,'' Green
said.
   He lives in nearby Sheepshead Bay and eats franks at the Coney
Island emporium four times a week. ``I've been eating them since I
was 4. I just totally love them,'' he said.
   This was not a particularly good year for the sport of hot-dog
eating. The record, set in 1979, was 17{. And Green himself ate 13\
hot dogs last year in a losing effort. Was the competition weak
this year?
   ``I guess so,'' the champ said.

   Here are thumbnail sketches of figures in the
burgeoning probe into allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military personnel, bribed
Pentagon officials for contracting details to help win lucrative
military contracts.

<HEAD>Melvyn Paisley</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Paisley is described as a major target in the probe, and the
highest-ranking former Pentagon official implicated. He is a former
Boeing Corp. executive who was assistant secretary of the Navy for
research, engineering and systems before leaving the government in
1987 to become a consultant to major defense contractors.
   At the Pentagon, Paisley fought hard for increases in the Navy
budget that would help build the fleet to 600 ships, working
closely with Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. Paisley supervised
procurement, specializing in acquisition of aircraft and combat
systems. He was known in Navy circles as a tough boss who was
contemptuous of bureaucrats. He was also known as a fun-loving
socializer married to his fourth wife.
   Paisley's consulting office was bugged and phone tapped for much
of the two-year FBI probe. His wife Vicki worked for BDM
International Inc. of McLean, Va. which does extensive business
with the Pentagon and which was subpoenaed in the probe. She now
owns VAMAO Inc., a defense firm founded in 1986 by defense
consultant William M. Galvin.
   A search warrant served on McDonnell Douglas Corp., where
Paisley did consulting work, alleged that when Paisley was in the
Navy he tried to steer a major Navy aircraft program to McDonnell
Douglas, funneled confidential bidding documents to the company and
used his influence to help the company in its competition for a
contract with South Korea for sales of the F-18 fighter.

   A well-connected defense consultant, Galvin has done work for a
number of the companies whose offices were searched by the FBI,
including Loral Corp., Unisys Corp., Cubic Defense Systems, Norden
Systems and United Technologies Corp. He is a member of the board
of Armtec Inc. of Palatka, Fla., whose offices were searched. He
has a consulting firm named Sapphire Systems.
   Published reports have said Galvin was a conduit to Paisley when
Paisley was in the Pentagon and that Galvin often boasted of his
access to him. He is also said to have entertained Pentagon and
industry figures lavishly.
   His office in the Watergate complex was searched, as was the
office of his stepson, Kenneth F. Brooke. His daughter, Joan
Galvin, was reassigned from her duties as a defense aide to Rep.
Andy Ireland, R-Fla.
   Galvin and his wife Evelyn recently moved to the Watergate from
an exclusive area of McLean, Va. They are described as very active
socially and fond of entertaining.

   Gardner resigned in March from his job as a Unisys vice
president. He met in May with Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., a member of
the House Armed Services Committee. Dyson had visited Unisys' Great
Neck, N.Y. defense facility. Gardner's home in Malverne, N.Y. was
searched.
   Gardner, now a defense consultant, hired Galvin as a consultant
while at Unisys and became a director of Sapphire Systems, one of
Galvin's consulting concerns. His phone was tapped during the
investigation. He was a campaign contributor to both Dyson and Rep.
William Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the defense appropriations
subcommittee.
   At Unisys, Gardner directed the surveillance and fire control
division of the company's Shipboard and Ground Systems Group. He
was responsible for Unisys' contract for the Aegis radar system.
Unisys won bidding to be a second source for the Aegis system after
Paisley revised the bidding rules in a way that favored Unisys.

According to a search warrant, Lyons has worked as a consultant to
McDonnell Douglas since at least last December. Sources say he was
hired to help the company sell jet fighters to South Korea.
   He is not believed to be a target of the investigation. He lives
in the exclusive Washington suburb of McLean, Va.
   Lyons became friends with Lehman while working with President
Reagan's transition committee in 1980. He was promoted rapidly over
the next few years, and is widely thought to have won his fourth
star and the command of the Pacific fleet because of Lehman's
intervention. James H. Webb, Lehman's successor, last year accused
Lehman of favoritism in handling military promotions and cited
Lyons as an example.

<HEAD>Tax Law Changes Spurs Shift Away From Second Mortgage Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new government study shows that home equity
loans are enjoying a boom in popularity because of changes in the
tax law, with more than 3 million homeowners choosing the loans
over second mortgages.
   The Federal Reserve, conducting its first comprehensive look at
the new consumer credit lines, found that three-fourths of all
existing loans were taken out in the past two years and that they
now account for more than $75 billion in total consumer debt.
   In fact, the Fed found that the most prevalent use of the home
equity loans, reported by 53 percent of all borrowers surveyed, was
to pay off other debt, mainly credit card debt or auto loans.
   The Fed survey found that the average interest charged on a home
equity loan in 1987 was 10.2 percent. That compared to an average
of 17.9 percent interest on credit card debt, 14.2 percent for a
24-month personal loan and 10.5 percent average interest on a
48-month new car loan.
   While second mortgages are extended for a specified period of
time and require repayment of principal and interest in equal
monthly installments, home equity accounts allow the borrower
flexibility in the size and timing of payments.

<TEXT>
   If drought keeps driving feed costs up and cow
prices down, dairy farmers may see earnings reduced by as much as
70 percent by 1989, according to a study by the National Milk
Producers Federation.
   Jim Barr, chief executive officer of the federation, said the
rising costs of grain _ concentrates _ are at the heart of the grim
outlook.
   ``At current milk and feed prices, a 15 percent increase in feed
costs equates to an effective reduction to the farmer of 50 cents
for each 100 pounds of milk marketed,'' he said in a report sent to
members this week.
   Spokeswoman Doni Dondero said the federation's analysts computed
that there is a potential for a drop in the net cash income of
dairy producers of between 50 percent and 70 percent.
   For example, she said in a telephone interview, if prices of
dairy concentrates rise 30 percent, forage costs go up 10 percent
and the market prices of culled cows sent to slaughter decline by
15 percent, net cash income could be around $1.33 per each 100
pounds of milk sold.
   Dondero said the figures were projected for a 12-month period,
July through June 1989. Income includes proceeds from the sale of
animals culled from dairy herds, in addition to milk marketed.
   Before the drought send feed costs higher _ the Agriculture
Department reported its price index for feed grains and hay rose 20
percent last month _ the federation had expected dairy net cash
income to average $2.51 per hundredweight of milk sold this year.
   Still another factor will be government actions to reduce milk
price supports again next year, Dondero said.
   If feed costs keep rising, market prices of culled cows keep
dropping, and the current support of $10.60 per hundredweight is
reduced further on Jan. 1, 1989, by 50 cents, net cash income of
producers could fall to as low as 99 cents per hundredweight,
Dondero said.
   Under 1985 farm law, the USDA is required to reduce milk price
supports when government purchases are expected to rise above 5
billion pounds of milk equivalent during the year.
   Milk price supports have undergone a succession of cuts since
rising to a peak of $13.10 per hundredweight in 1983. The
reductions were undertaken to help discourage surplus production
and to whittle down federal costs.
   As it looks now to USDA economists, dairy purchases will exceed
the 5 billion pounds set by law as the trigger for further cuts in
the support.
   Some dairy state members of Congress have urged Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng to forestall the next reduction because
of the hardship imposed by the drought. Lyng, however, has said the
law gives him no choice.
   But last week Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said the drought
and rising feed costs have ``prompted a reassessment of the
situation'' regarding another 50-cent cut in milk supports next
year.
   Boehlert also said that Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, chairman
of the House Agriculture subcommittee on dairy, livestock and
poultry, had predicted ``it's 99 percent sure'' that the Jan. 1,
1989, reduction will not take place.
   Joined by several colleagues, including Rep. Jim Jeffords,
R-Vt., Boehlert introduced a bill last week giving the secretary of
agriculture the authority to halt the Jan. 1 cut in milk supports.
   The bill also would give USDA the authority to increase supports
by 50 cents per hundredweight for each 15 percent increase in feed
costs.
   Meanwhile, dairy farmers began stepping up production again this
year, at least before the drought became rampant and forced feed
costs up. Based on the earlier indications, USDA economist figured
1988 milk output would rise 2 percent to 3 percent from last year's
142.5 billion pounds.
   Milk output decline last year from the 1986 record level of
143.4 billion pounds as producers cut back herds under the USDA's
Dairy Termination Program, or whole-herd buyout, designed to trim
surplus production.

   President Miguel de la Madrid promised
Wednesday's general elections will be fraud-free, while the leading
opposition presidential candidate said politics were behind the
weekend killings of two of his aides.
   ``We Mexicans are committed to have a clean, legal and peaceful
election'' on Wednesday, de la Madrid said.
   ``Today I confirm to you it is a commitment of the government of
the republic to comply strictly with the law. There will be respect
for the will expressed in the ballot boxes,'' he said during a
brief televised address to the nation Monday night.
   Francisco Javier Ovando, 45, the national coordinator and a
congressional candidate of the leftist National Democratic Front
coalition, and Roman Gil Heraldez, a 28-year-old aide, were shot to
death Saturday night in a car in downtown Mexico City.
   ``I feel rage over these political crimes, committed by
professionals, groups of assassins led by reactionaries,'' said
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the front's presidential candidate.
   He did not elaborate on who he thought was responsible.
   Polls indicate Cardenas could finish second on Wednesday to
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, candidate of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The PRI has not lost a presidential
election since its creation in 1929.
   Ovando and Gil helped create the Effective Suffrage Assembly, a
citizens' watchdog group, to expose any fraud in the elections.
Ovando also served as Cardenas' private secretary.
   A lengthy statement issued by the attorney general Monday night
said Ovando and Gil died instantly from .22-caliber bullets fired
at point-blank range _ Ovando with four bullets in the head and Gil
with one in the temple.
   It offered no leads or a possible motive and said there were no
witnesses to the slayings, reported to police by an anonymous
caller at 11:30 p.m. Saturday.
   Luis Sanchez Aguilar, a senior official of both the Front and
the watchdog group, charged the killings were politically motivated.
   He said Ovando was carrying confidential documents about the
opposition effort to detect election fraud at the time he was
killed. The documents were not found inside the car, Sanchez
Aguilar said.
   Cardenas has appointed a Front official to participate in the
police investigation, the attorney general's statement said.
   And, in an open letter, he urged de la Madrid and the Mexico
City attorney general to bring those responsible to swift justice.
   ``It would be very serious if the government and official
elements have answered the democratic actions of the opposition
with terrorism and illegality,'' said the letter, published in
Monday's editions of the newspaper La Jornada.
   De la Madrid did not mention the shootings in his address, but
expressed his ``recognition and respect to all the parties and
candidates that have competed in this electoral contest.''
   Salinas de Gortari expressed ``the most vigorous condemnation''
of the slayings and called on authorities to give ``the greatest
speed to clarify this lamentable deed'' in a statement released
late Monday night.
   The PRI's national executive committee also condemned the
shootings in a statement released Monday night. It urged party
activists ``not to oppose provocations'' stemming from the incident
and ``at all times to avail themselves of the resources of the
law.''
   Cardenas led a reform movement within the PRI before leaving the
party last year to head his own presidential candidacy. With the
endorsement of the Socialist Party this spring, the National
Democratic Front has mounted the strongest challenge yet to the
PRI's hold on the presidency.

<TEXT>
   The Fourth of July was even quieter that
usual among Americans in the Persian Gulf this year because of the
U.S. attack on an Iranian jetliner.
   Those who had not gone on vacation to escape the searing heat
observed Independence Day by going to work as usual, except for
embassy staffs, who had the day off.
   The missile cruiser USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Air Airbus
on Sunday after mistaking it for an F-14 fighter and warning it
seven times. Iran said all 290 people aboard were killed.
   All of the approximately 20,000 U.S. citizens in the gulf Arab
states were advised to maintain low profiles, and U.S. embassies
around the world issued warnings to Americans to ``exercise
discretion'' in their activities.
   Americans around the gulf paid special heed because some of the
Arab countries have large populations of Shiite Moslems, the
dominant sect in Iran.
   Navy officials canceled leaves and shore passes for American
servicemen as another precaution against possible terrorist acts
against the sailors.
   U.S. sources say the American population of the gulf has
dwindled in recent years and includes about 15,000 in Saudi Arabia,
1,200 in Bahrain and fewer than 1,000 each in Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman.
   In addition, about 20,000 American military personnel are in the
region, most aboard ships.
   A few U.S. diplomatic missions, including the fortress-like
embassy in downtown Kuwait, had small July 4th parties for staff
members and a few guests.
   Security concerns have reduced the size of official Independence
Day celebrations. The U.S. Embassy in Bahrain even held one in
February, built around ``Presidents' Day'' marking the birthdays of
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
   Officials said the date was chosen because more people were on
hand at that time than in the heat of July.
   At the small U.S. Navy shore facility, hidden away near
Bahrain's main port, just 40 sailors were present for the
ceremonial raising of the Stars and Stripes that occurs only July 4.
   An American officer said many more usually would attend the
flag-raising and an outdoor cookout, but plans to bring about 200
sailors ashore for the day were canceled.
   A bus awaiting a bomb check at the gate carried only about 15
men.
   No American sailors were at their few in-town haunts: hotel
lobbies with international telephone booths, coffee shops, the
Sheraton complex shopping mall and the Arab market district.

<HEAD>Researchers Pay People to Fall Down Stairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Tech researchers have constructed
collapsing stairs and are paying volunteers to tumble down them
wearing crash helmets, neck braces and padded mittens. All in the
name of science.
   ``Stairs are the second most dangerous consumer product _ right
after automobiles _ but the one thing we really don't know is what
happens in the instant of a fall,'' said researcher Deborah Hyde of
Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Architecture.
   Researchers have constructed a pneumatic stairway that can
collapse in any of five different ways to prompt a scientific
pratfall. Volunteers are paid $15 dollars for falling on that
air-cushioned flight. Each subject's flailing arms and legs are
frozen by strobe lights and high-speed cameras for later analysis.
   Designers are looking for new insights into how to make a safer
flight of stairs. Results already have disspelled some
misconceptions about when and how people stumble.
   For example, although people generally fear falling down a
flight of stairs, research shows they are more likely to stumble on
the way up.
   During the experiment, each volunteer is trussed in a green
flight suit, neck brace, crash helmet and padded mittens, and slung
from a red parachute harness that automatically arrests each fall.
   ``At a predetermined point, we turn on an electric beam that
goes across the front edge of the stair we want them to fall on,''
Ms. Hyde said. ``They break the beam and that acts as the trigger
to collapse the stair.''
   So far the researchers have entered 1,400 images from 50
recorded falls into a computer to recreate a complete electronic
composite of a bad fall.
   ``The computer simulation will tell us what position they would
have landed in, what they would have hit first,'' Ms. Hyde said.
``We need to learn what kind of forces people generate when they
fall.''
   As many as 2.6 million people every year are injured in stairway
falls. An undeveloped or deteriorating sense of balance make the
danger acute for children or the elderly.
   The Georgia Tech team has a two-year, $125,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation to develop energy-absorbing foams that
could replace the wood, metal and stone of traditional stairways.
   ``With stairs, you are always going to have accidents. You can't
pad people,'' Ms. Hyde said. ``So you have to come up with some way
to attenuate the forces that build up in a fall.''

   A supermarket was destroyed by two explosions
that erupted minutes after about 40 customers were evacuated

   Nine people injured in the explosions Monday were treated and
released from area hospitals, said Scott LaGreca, a fire department

   ``We could smell gas real strong,'' said Jack Hewitt, a cashier
at the Super Buy Grocery on the city's west side. ``We were opening
the doors to get some air when it blew up. I was knocked into the

   The force from the first explosion blew out one wall of the
two-story building, crushing three cars in the parking lot. Another
explosion followed seconds later, arson investigators said.
   ``At this point, it looks like it could be a natural-gas
explosion,'' said Detective Joe Campbell.

   President Fidel Castro has enhanced his image on
human rights by releasing hundreds of political prisoners, but
dissidents say thousands more remain in jail or are ostracized for
opposing the regime.
   Communist authorities have nearly halved the dissident
population in Cuban prisons since Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York asked Castro to release 433 people charged with political
crimes, said Bienvenido Avierno, a Foreign Ministry official.
O'Connor visited Cuba in April.
   Former political prisoners are among the 300 or so Cubans
leaving Havana each month aboard charter flights that depart four
times a week for Miami.
   Asked if the releases benefit the government by letting it purge
dissidents, Avierno said, ``Sure, we are maintaining these guys.''
   One dissident here says the government has only become more
sophisticated in curbing its domestic opposition.
   ``Everything is repressive here,'' Ricardo Bofill, president of
the banned Cuban Human Rights Committee, said in a recent interview
at his one-room apartment in the Havana suburb of Guanabacoa.
``Their tactics have changed. Now they use mobs and press
campaigns.''
   Bofill, a Communist Party member before Castro came to power in
1959, has been jailed several times for speaking out against the
government. He has stayed at home for the past four months, saying
he fears for his life.
   ``There are death threats. I have been identified in Cuba as the
head of the counterrevolutionaries, the No. 1 enemy,'' Bofill said,
sitting in a rocking chair in his room.
   The Communist Party newspaper Granma devoted several pages in
April to discrediting Bofill. ``He is totally twisted and imbued
with double-dealing lies, faking, deception and, especially a
monstrous ego and unquenchable thirst for fame and notoriety,'' it
said.
   Bofill's group compiles and distributes reports of government
abuses. He showed a reporter a handwritten prison pamphlet called
``Dawn,'' which detailed ``systematic cruelty.''
   He said Cuba has 10,000 political prisoners. Amnesty
International, the London-based human rights group, put the number
at 450 in its 1987 annual report.
   The Castro government tolerates Bofill, often citing his
criticisms as proof Cuba has freedom of expression.
   Avierno flatly denies there are any rights abuses in Cuba: ``The
people, for the first time in their lives, have the arms. If they
didn't like the system they could use them.''
   Bofill said he does not oppose the government, but rather its
tactics: ``This is not a fight against the system, it is against an
unjust order. The basic rights, the right to life, is not
guaranteed.''
   In Cuba, only state-run news media are allowed to operate and
the government decides who can leave the country and who can return.
   Bofill displayed his identification card, a booklet resembling a
passport, and showed the government stamp that indicates he has
applied for permission to leave the country.
   He said the stamp identifies him and thousands of others as
malcontents.
   Roberto Bermudez, 32, a painter, said his opposition to the
government has meant he can't exhibit his paintings.
   Sebastian Arcos, a former professor of dentistry and
ex-political prisoner, said thousands of Cubans depicted as social
outcasts are unable to find work.
   Cuba's socialist policies mean free and often model health care
and education. The government says its provision of these social
services constitutes a human right.
   ``This is a country where we have education, health, a country
where drugs, especially hard drugs, are unheard of. No child needs
to leave his studies to help his family. Violence is practically
unknown. These are human rights,'' Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice
president of the Council of State, said in an interview.
   Castro this year permitted the International Red Cross to
examine Cuban prisons for the first time. A confidential report is
being prepared.
   In addition, a United Nations human rights group is expected to
inspect the prisons by September.
   The United States maintains no formal diplomatic relations with
Cuba. But the U.S. Interests Section in Havana receives ``thousands
upon thousands of letters from Cubans requesting political asylum
in the United States,'' spokeman Jerry Scott said.
   An agreement renewed last year will allow 3,000 Cubans to travel
to the United States as refugees.
   Avierno said the Cuban government agreed to free most of the
prisoners requested by O'Connor ``if the United States guarantees
they can go there.''
   About 40 of that group will not be released because they ``are
very dangerous people and they must fulfill their sentences,''
Avierno said. The maximum prison term is 30 years.

   The Soviet Union's various reactions to the U.S.
Navy's downing of an Iranian airliner appeared designed to maintain
smooth Soviet-U.S. relations while satisfying some allies' desires
for a harsh response.
   Moscow radio said Monday that the Navy committed ``deliberate
mass murder,'' but Kremlin reaction was milder and defense
officials did not even bring it up with an American visitor.
   The United States said the crew of the USS Vincennes shot down
the Iran Air jetliner over the Persian Gulf on Sunday when they
mistook it for an F-14 fighter and it failed to heed warnings. Iran
said all 290 aboard were killed.
   In China, official newspapers today joined in condemning the
attack and said major powers must cease ``meddling'' in the gulf.
   The Kremlin's first statement about the incident contrasted with
angry pronouncements by President Reagan and other U.S. officials
after Soviet fighters shot down a South Korean airliner with 269
aboard.
   Reagan spoke at the time of ``the barbarity of the Soviet
government in shooting down an unarmed plane.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told a news
briefing that the Soviet Union did not intend to follow the ``bad
example'' of ``wild'' American criticism after KAL Flight 007 was
shot down Sept. 1, 1983.
   He said the U.S. explanation that U.S. sailors could not tell
the difference on radar screens between the Airbus 300 and a F-14
jet fighter ``appeared to be strange.''
   ``It shows American naval officers were not very competent, or
to use an American phrase, trigger-happy,'' Gerasimov declared.
   He noted that KAL Flight 007 was over a ``strategically
sensitive'' area of the Soviet Far East while the Iranian jet was
``flying over its own territory and territorial waters.''
   The spokesman also said the profile of the KAL jet was similar
to that of American spy planes, while the profile of an Airbus and
an Iranian fighter are distinct. He said the South Korean plane was
shot down at night and the Iranian jet in daylight.
   Gerasimov said the shooting was an outgrowth of American policy
in the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since
September 1980, and proved U.S. actions there were dangerous.
   ``U.S. naval forces must immediately leave the waters of the
Persian Gulf,'' he said.
   Moscow radio's reaction was far stronger. Its English-language
service called the attack ``deliberate mass murder in cold blood''
and asked:
   ``What was the American cruiser defending itself from? Was is
threatened by the 66 children and 52 women who were among the
nearly 300 passengers of the airplane?''
   It called the Vincennes ``a brazen intruder in an alien land.''
   ``There is a difference between a true act of self-defense _
protection of a nation's borders _ and deliberate, cruel murder,''
it said, claiming the KAL flight was on a spy mission and received
warnings.
   Neither Gerasimov nor official media accounts mentioned U.S.
contentions that the Airbus had flown into a war zone. The radio,
quoting Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, said the jet
was in ``a corridor reserved for civilian aviation.''
   Aides to Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge had feared the
event would make his current visit to Moscow difficult. A U.S.
official said it was not mentioned in meetings Aldridge had Monday
with the Soviet air force chief, Marshal Alexander N. Yefimov, and
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov.
   The China Daily said it was hard to believe that the Vincennes
could not distinguish a wide-bodied commercial airliner from a
two-seat fighter jet.
   ``The fatal incident of the Airbus crash has once again
underlined the urgency for the removal of big powers' military
meddling in the region and for the peaceful settlement between the
warring nations,'' it said.

<HEAD>Controversial Films About Poor Villagers Win China's Academy
Awards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two controversial movies about poor peasants that
won prizes abroad tied for best picture in the 1988 Golden Rooster
competition, China's Academy Awards, official reports said today.
   ``The Old Well'' and ``Red Sorghum'' also shared best picture
honors with a third movie, ``Prairie,'' in an annual public opinion
contest called the Hundred Flowers Awards, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
   The Golden Rooster prizes are awarded by a panel of experts from
the movie industry.
   Controversy has become a staple of the Golden Rooster Awards in
the past few years as China's filmmakers become increasingly
sophisticated in their styles and themes.
   This year was no exception, but the debate did not delay the
awards as it did in 1987 and 1986. Last year's prizes were not
given until January because of behind-the-scenes wrangling.
   Critics said ``The Old Well'' and ``Red Sorghum,'' both made by
the relatively avant-garde Xian Film Studio, focused on the
backwardness and poverty of China instead of seeking to inspire.
Both depict poor villagers in arid northwestern China, and both
treat sexuality with relative frankness.
   The Shanghai newspaper Wen Hui Bao said the Xian Film Studio
received letters saying the movies were ``hateful productions that
sell the ugliness of Chinese in a bid to invite the appreciation of
foreigners.''
   Delegates to the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, demanded at their annual meeting in April to know what
the movies were trying to accomplish, the paper said.
   ``The Old Well'' won top prize at the Tokyo Grand Prix last year
and a special prize at the Hawaii International Film Festival.
``Red Sorghum'' was named top film at the West Berlin Film Festival
in February.
   Wu Tianming, head of the Xian studio and director of ``The Old
Well,'' told The Associated Press in an interview this year that
his goal is to depict the realities of life in modern China, even
if these realities offend government censors with ``feudal and
ultra-left ideas.''
   In ``The Old Well,'' a young couple, the best-educated in their
poor village, devote all their energies to finding a water supply
for the village, but are prevented from marrying by the young man's
father.
   The movie depicts the tension between an older generation
comfortable with its backward life and a younger generation trying
to better the village and make its own choices in love.
   ``Red Sorghum'' was directed by Wu's protege, Zhang Yimou, who
also starred in ``The Old Well'' and won best actor honors in both
the Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers contests.
   ``Red Sorghum,'' set in the 1930s, shows the relatively
uninhibited life style of a band of sorghum winemakers and ends
with several being killed by the invading Japanese.
   Ironically, Chinese films are breaking away from long-imposed
ideological constraints and experimenting with more sophisticated
techniques at a time when theater attendance is falling sharply and
studios are sinking deeper and deeper into debt.
   The official Guangming Daily said today that urgent measures are
needed to halt the decline. It said one-fourth of Chinese films
have lost money in recent years, blaming too much government
interference in film distribution.
   The paper recommended that studios be given control of marketing
and exporting their films and that ticket prices be raised.
   In cities, movie tickets range from less than 1 cent to 24
cents, while in the countryside village governments often arrange
to show movies free.
   Urban movie theaters tend to be crowded, noisy places and many
people prefer to stay home and watch television.

<HEAD>Anglican Church Debates Whether To Ordain Women Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Anglican Church said the
priesthood in England can only gain by ordaining women, but
opponents within the church said they based their case on tradition
and the Bible.
   ``I have come to the judgment that the ordination of women to
the priesthood would actually be an enlargement of the Catholic
(universal) priesthood, an opening up of priesthood, rather than
its overturning,'' Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said
Monday.
   Runcie, the church's spiritual head and leader of the world's 70
million Anglicans, made his comments before the policy-making
General Synod of 574 bishops, clergy and laity as it opened its
regular three-day summer session.
   An all-day debate on allowing women into the priesthood was
planned today.
   The church still bars women priests although Anglican churches
in other countries have ordained about 1,000 women, according to
England's Movement for the Ordination of Women. Ordaining churches
include the U.S. Episcopalians and Anglicans in Canada, New
Zealand, Hong Kong, Brazil, Kenya and Uganda.
   Runcie said that in an age when women took part in leadership,
the priesthood actually may be weakened by being solely male.
   Opponents say there is nothing in the Bible to support women
priests; that Jesus Christ who founded Christianity had only male
apostles and for nearly 2,000 years the church ordained only men.
   The debate on women's ordination has lasted more than 20 years.
   New proposals in the debate include giving a bishop who opposes
women priests the right to bar them in his diocese and to pay up to
$51,000 compensation to priests who leave the church over the issue
on grounds of conscience.
   The Anglican state church has seemed to be moving slowly toward
ordaining women but even if the proposals are endorsed there is
still a long way to go.
   The legislation will be referred to revision committees and then
to all 44 diocesan synods. It will return to the General Synod for
final approval but it must then be approved by Parliament.
   The church cannot legislate alone on matters of doctrine because
it is an established church, meaning it is established by laws made
by Parliament and has the monarch as its temporal head.
   If all stages are passed without delay, the Church of England's
first woman priest may be ordained in 1992 or 1993.
   A majority of the 53 diocesan and deputy bishops are in favor of
women priests but some, like Bishop of London Graham Leonard _ the
third-ranking prelate _ are strongly against. Sections of the
clergy and laity are also opposed.
   Speakers in favor of women priests at Monday's debate
outnumbered opponents by four to one.
   Bishop of Durham David Jenkins said he found the arguments for a
male God ``wholly incredible.''
   ``This portrayal of God attempts to retain the power of men in
the church, is an affront to the full, vital and immensely needed
humanity of women and is a denial of the mystery of God,'' he said.
   But Sir John Stokes, a Conservative Party legislator, asked:
``Have we the power to make such a fundamental change without
consulting the rest of Christendom when we are clearly not of one
mind?''

   Iran has asked the International Civil Aviation
Organization to immediately begin an investigation into an American
warship's downing of an Iranian passenger jetliner over the Persian
Gulf.
   But officials of the U.N. agency said Monday that they need more
information, particularly from the United States, before granting
the request.
   ``We have not received ... preliminary reports regarding the
circumstances from the parties involved, except from Iran,''
organization president Assad Kotaite said.
   Ali Akbar Golruni, Iran's representative to the organization,
filed a formal request Monday for an emergency meeting of the
agency's council to set up an inquiry into the crash.
   The USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Air jetliner on Sunday on a
commercial flight over the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the
gulf. All 290 people aboard were believed killed.
   The Pentagon said the Airbus 300 was mistaken for an Iranian
fighter jet, was flying outside the commercial air corridor and did
not respond to seven radioed warnings.
   Iran claims the jet was inside the commercial corridor. It has
also said the pilot did not report any emergency before the crash.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization, with 159 member
countries, oversees the safety and efficiency of world airlines.

<TEXT>
   Members of the back-to-nature Rainbow
Family ended their 17th annual ``gathering of the tribes'' with
mudbaths in an east Texas national forest and prayers for peace and
harmony.
   ``Women in Beverly Hills pay $300 for this and we get it for
free,'' said a woman who identified herself only as Marcia from
Arizona, one of those clad only in mud who said it cleansed the
skin.
   The loosely knit group, which had predicted as many as 20,000
people would attend, drew 4,392 participants, according to federal
marshals stationed in the Angelina National Forest, about 125 miles
northeast of Houston.
   ``The presence of officials wearing official clothing made it
intimidating,'' said one Rainbow member who called herself Alita.
   Many of the participants sat Indian-style, back-to-back, in
various states of dress and undress. Some wore only mud.
   Participants had been dogged by repeated court challenges from
the U.S. Forest Service, which insisted the Rainbow Family comply
with regulations covering use of the forest area.
   U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice finally ruled that up
to 5,000 people could gather at each of three designated
campgrounds, although most of the people selected one site known as
Mud Flats.
   The judge also ordered that the group each day buy 15,000
gallons of fresh water to be trucked to the campground.
   Forest Service and health officials sought to prevent a
recurrence of dysentery that struck some 6,000 people from 29
states after they attended last year's Rainbow gathering in North
Carolina. Nearly 13,000 attended there.
   On Monday, a rainbow appeared in the sky overhead and thunder
and lightning crackled as the family's meeting culminated with a
prayer vigil on the shores of Lake Sam Rayburn.
   Some of the people, who had been arriving in the forest since
last week, reached the prayer site at dawn Monday and sat in
silence, meditating around two banners as temperatures climbed to
near 100 degrees.
   One of the banners, emblazoned with a rainbow, read: ``Silent
Vigil For World Peace.''
   ``Back to front, yin to yang, a chain is built _ a chain that
binds in love and peace,'' said a Rainbow member who identified
himself as Wu Qi. He continuously circled the gathering, wearing
only a coat of mud that hardened on him as the sun baked him.
   Forest Service officials said this year's gathering was
significant in that legal questions were addressed that will affect
future such gatherings.
   ``Public health and safety, for example,'' Carl Gidlund, a
Forest Service spokesman, said. ``Now we have the Public Health
Service in to ensure it's clean. It's a technical point, but now
people have some protection. And for the first time, it's a
controlled gathering.''

   An object in about 800 feet of water
outside the mouth of Pearl Harbor might be a Japanese submarine
believed sunk hours before the attack on Dec. 7, 1941, authorities
said.
   ``It could be anything,'' said Bill Dickinson, superintendent of
the USS Arizona Memorial Park. ``Even a bunch of oil drums in a
line. But it looks promising.''
   Sonar pings produced a shape that matches what is known about
midget submarines involved in the Japanese attack, Dickinson said,
adding that it was in a ``high probably area'' for the midget sub.
   ``It's going to take a lot more to confirm what's down there,''
he said. ``First, we have to locate the resources to pay for a
search and then convince the University of Hawaii or National
Geographic or somebody else with deep-diving equipment to go down
and take a look.''
   ``That's the only way the mystery will be solved,'' he said.
   In the predawn hours before the Japanese launched their surprise
air assault on Pearl Harbor and other military bases on the island
of Oahu, the destroyer USS Ward spotted something odd in the water
leading to the harbor entrance.
   It was one of five midget subs involved in the attack and was
trying to slip into the harbor. Each sub had a two-man crew and two
torpedoes.
   The Ward fired shells at the intruder, apparently hitting the
conning tower, and then blanketed the area with depth charges.
   Nothing more was seen of the sub and it remains the only one of
the five unaccounted for.
   The underwater object was detected Friday during a survey of
Pearl Harbor and surrounding waters as a cooperative effort of the
Navy and the National Parks Service with funds from the Arizona
Memorial Museum.
   It is being done to fulfill a federal requirement that historic
artifacts in a national historic landmark be catalogued.

   The body of U.S. Navy Capt. William E.
Nordeen, the military attache killed in a terrorist bomb attack,
was flown to the United States today for burial at Arlington
National Cemetery.
   After a brief ceremony on the tarmac at the U.S. Air Force base
at Athens Airport, six bearers carried the flag-draped coffin into
a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport plane for the flight to Dover, Del.
   The coffin was accompanied by Nordeen's British-born wife
Patricia and 12-year-old daughter Annabel.
   Base officials said the plane was due to arrive at 5:05 .m. EDT.
The burial will take place on Wednesday.
   Nordeen, 51, died one week ago when a car bomb exploded next to
his armor-plated car as he was driving to work from his home in a
northern Athens suburb.
   A local leftist terrorist group called November 17 said it had
killed Nordeen. The group has taken responsibility for the 13
political assassinations in Athens since 1975, including the murder
of two other American diplomats.
   None of the killings has been solved. Greek police, who are
being assisted by FBI and State Department investigators, say they
have so far made no progress in the Nordeen case.

<TEXT>
   After six years of trying to convince
companies their computer data is as good as gold, Secured Data
Services Inc. finally can see light at the end of its tunnel.
   In this case, the tunnel is a half mile through limestone to a
two-acre site 80 feet underground near Lewisburg in southwest Ohio.
   Behind motion detectors, video cameras, chain-link fences and a
7-inch-thick vault door are 20,000 computer tapes, disks and
cassettes, protected as backups against natural or other disasters,
said Steven L. Wright, a consultant.
   Many belong to Fortune 500 companies, he said. Others are from
area retailers who have found out the hard way that in these days
of computerized checkout and inventory, an employee error or
sabotage can make backup tapes a lifeblood transfusion.
   Secured Data won't name its clients for security reasons.
Likewise, there is no name on the entrance to its cave.
   A growing number of such high-security vaults, including one in
an old railroad tunnel under New York City's World Trade Center,
are catering to companies which realize that a computer without
secure backup data is a sitting duck for disaster and possible
financial ruin.
   ``The market is just now beginning to open up. Companies are
just now starting to store their records in a coherent fashion,''
said Charles C. Johnson, Secured Data's vice president and general
manager.
   Johnson, 30, a former Procter & Gamble Co. analytical chemist
who was in charge of one of the company's computer systems, joined
Secured Data three years ago when the company was having trouble
getting its message across.
   Today, sales are doubling every 10 months and are approaching $1
million, he said. Secured Data charges clients from less than $50
per month to more than $8,000, depending on the number of tapes and
frequency of access.
   The company is aiming at a market within a 120-mile radius that
it can serve with four-hour delivery, Johnson said.
   ``Disaster preparedness at the moment is getting to be a
buzzword. We love accountants'' who are pushing for it, Wright said.
   Recent disasters, such as the First Interstate Bank building
fire in Los Angeles, are advertising for the company, he said.
   Yet data security services still can be hard to sell, Wright
said.
   There are still those companies which believe the only backup
protection they need is to have an employee take the tapes home in
the car trunk.
   Competition also is getting tougher, partly from public
warehouses converting to offer records storage, Wright said.
   Secured Data was founded in 1982 by James M. Valentine, who also
owned a foundry and is a co-founder of Cincinnati Microwave.
   Valentine, who still has the title of president, has said he got
the idea to use part of the 250-acre mine after visiting a similar
facility in Montreal.
   It took about $300,000 in modifications, including leveling
floors, enclosing a 3,500-square-foot vault and a 7,600-square-foot
``cold room'' that is prewired for a company to bring in its own
backup computer.
   The temperature is a constant 55 degrees, although heat from the
lights and people meant there had to be air conditioning, Wright
said. There also is electrostatic dust protection _ dust can be as
much an enemy to tapes as heat.
   The vault is lined with halon fire extinguishers.
   Tape librarian Barbara Clark said once there was a small
earthquake in the area ``and we didn't even know it happened down
here. ... If I worry about anything happening down here, it's the
electricity going out,'' she said.
   It has, once or twice, but with no major problems, Wright said.

<HEAD>House Speaker Says Reagan Should Be More Apologetic About Downing
Jetliner</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Airliner Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright said today that President
Reagan should be more apologetic for the U.S. Navy's shooting down
of an Iranian passenger jet over the Persian Gulf.
   Wright also said Congress would favor compensating Iran for the
tragedy.
   He said Americans are ``deeply grateful'' to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher for saying she understood the Navy's reason for
shooting at the plane.
   Iran said all 290 people aboard the Iran Air jetliner were
killed when the USS Vincennes shot the plane out of the sky on
Sunday. The United States said the ship's crew thought the plane
was a fighter and warned it seven times.
   Asked in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview if the
United States should offer monetary compensation to Iran, Wright
said, ``Yes, if that would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved
party, surely we could do that ... Congress would support that if
it were requested.''
   But the Texas Democrat said he doubted whether ``the offer of
money would be just retribution for the loss of human life.''
   Wright said Reagan had expressed regret for the loss of innocent
lives but ``is not given to profuse apologies in any event.'' Asked
if he ought to be, Wright replied, ``Yes, he should be.''
   ``We close ranks, so please don't ask me to try to correct the
language of the president,'' Wright said. ``I'm just stating as a
matter of fact that Mr. Reagan is not given to acknowledging error.
It's a personal trait, he's gone as far as I've ever heard him go
and he has expressed his deep regret as president of the United
States.''
   Wright called the attack ``a tragic error.''
   ``We have not been able to invent with all our genius a machine
or a radar screen that can detect the intentions of the pilot
flying an aircraft,'' he said.
   But Wright said he believes Iran bears ``much of the
responsibility'' because Iranian gunboats ``had our vessel under
attack at that time, under unprovoked attack.''
   ``Surely they (Iran) should have understood that flying
commercial aircraft in a war zone in which their military attack
boats launched an ... attack on our personnel and area would put
lives in danger,'' he said.
   Wright met Monday with Mrs. Thatcher and Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe during a long-planned five-day trip to London.
   Mrs. Thatcher's government issued a statement Sunday night
saying it deeply regretted the disaster but backed the U.S. Navy's
right to defend itself.
   ``I don't suppose we could have asked for a more understanding
attitude on the part of the British government,'' Wright said.
``All of us are deeply grateful of course in our time of anguish
that our friends would stand beside us and offer a degree of
understanding.''

<TEXT>
   Hai Nguyen, a city mechanical engineer,
laughed self-consciously as he unrolled toilet paper while visitors
watched a test flush of the porcelain privy he had rigged.
   Nguyen pushed a button and a pressurized tank in the Water
Closet Inc. fixture discharged a shot of water into the toilet
bowl, which then emptied in nine seconds.
   ``This is the wave of the future,'' said an impressed R.J.
Martin, the city's chief plumbing inspector.
   Welcome to the city's toilet test lab, where the next generation
of high-tech toilets, which use a mere 1{ gallons per flush, are
being put through their paces. No commode can be sold until it has
passed the code.
   The Los Angeles lab's flush requirements are set by the American
National Standard Institute, which specifies that the toilet paper
field test, ``shall be comprised of an appropriate number of
six-sheet strips of single-ply roll toilet paper, each crumpled
into a loose ball measuring 2 to 3 inches in diameter.''
   Latex cylinders, ping-pong balls and other materials are also
specified by ANSI for certain tests. Another standard determines if
a toilet can rinse off a line drawn inside the rim with a
water-soluble marker.
   ``I think Los Angeles is one of the few _ if not the only _
municipality in the country with a test lab to make sure toilets
are in compliance,'' said James S. Nishimoto, whose mechanical
engineering division oversees the lab operated by the city
Department of Building and Safety.
   Within a stone's throw of the Los Angeles River, city engineers
at the laboratory ensure that toilets from designer thrones by Ifo
of Sweden to the American Standard models meet the same
requirements for flushing, scouring and rinsing.
   For some critics, the lab's certification of low-flush toilets
is taking too much time and hampering water conservation efforts in
a drought year.
   A new measure passed by the Los Angeles City Council in April
seeks to conserve water and ease the strain on the city's aging and
overwhelmed sewer system.
   Among other things, the measure requires installation of
``low-flush'' toilets for new construction. The toilets use just 1{
gallons per flush, compared to the usual 3 to 6 gallons.
   About 10 low-flush models have been developed, but only one has
been certified for use in Los Angeles, said lab manager Yogen R.
Thakar.
   ``It's just another example of a bureaucracy going around in
circles to me,'' said Larry Farwell, water conservation coordinator
for the Goleta Water District in Santa Barbara County.
   Certification is pending for the WCI unit, which was tested
recently, Thakar said. It takes from eight to 10 hours to test a
privy, but three to four months to certify each model. ``It's a
bureaucratic process,'' he explained.
   Critics also complain that the city's lab charges a minimum $500
to test each model, and $300 each year afterward to renew its
certification.
   ``It's totally unnecessary,'' said Tom Scheller of DEA Bathroom
Machineries, a plumbing importer and distributor based in Murphys,
Calif. ``The city is just using it as a means of generating
revenue.''
   The fees charged by the lab pay for most of its $600,000
operating budget, Nishimoto said. The lab also tests garden-hose
pesticide sprayers, commercial washing machines, dishwashers, ice
machines and just about anything else that is connected to the
city's potable water supply.
   ``I do feel that it serves an important function,'' Nishimoto
said. ``It's an area that's in public health, and I really don't
think any other lab gives it the same kind of attention that we
do.''

<HEAD>Twenty Officers Face Hearings In Killings Of Unarmed Catholics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of this British
province's mostly Protestant police force has ordered an internal
disciplinary hearing for 20 officers in the 1982 killings of six
unarmed Roman Catholics.
   Chief Constable Sir John Hermon of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
ordered the hearing on Monday. Critics have charged that police had
a ``shoot-to-kill'' policy and that a subsequent cover-up
undermined efforts to persuade the Catholic minority to accept
police authority.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's government across the border in
the Irish Republic said that substituting an internal police
hearing for prosecutions in the courts will not allay public
concern.
   The officers at the closed-door internal hearing could face
penalties ranging from cautions and reprimands to fines, loss of
pension rights, demotions and dismissal from the police force.
   Hermon said a chief constable from the British mainland will be
appointed to preside over the hearing. He did not name the 20
officers, give details of the precise charges against them or say
when the hearing will be held.
   But press reports said it is expected to be held in Belfast and
that the 20 officers range from constable, the lowest rank in the
police force, to middle-ranked chief superintendent.
   Haughey's government, Catholic politicians, civil libertarians
and the human rights group Amnesty International say the killings
were illegal.
   In a three-week period at the end of 1982, police shot to death
five acknowledged guerrillas, all unarmed, and an innocent
teen-ager in three incidents, two at police roadblocks and one in a
barn.
   Two years later, a senior mainland detective was called in to
investigate after it emerged in court that officers had perjured
themselves covering up the circumstances of the killings.
   The detective, John Stalker, has written a book that says he was
forced off the case because he was close to proving police
conspired to bypass legal procedures and shoot to kill guerrilla
suspects.
   His inquiry was completed by Colin Sampson, another senior
mainland officer. Sampson's conclusions led to an announcement by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government that while evidence
indicated that officers perverted justice, there would be no
prosecutions.
   Acting on Sampson's report, the police authority decided no
disciplinary action was required against Hermon or his two deputies.
   Meanwhile, a parallel investigation was conducted into the
conduct of lower-ranking officers, and this led to Monday's
announcement of an internal disciplinary hearing.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the province's largest Catholic party, said he was
dissatisfied.
   ``It is both unfair and unjust for 20 men of lower rank to take
the rap when those with real responsibility remain protected by and
shrouded in mystery regarding their own conduct,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the monthly meeting of Belfast City Council was
abandoned Monday night after fist fights broke out between
Protestant and Catholic members.
   The fighting involved about 20 people _ members of the
province's two Protestant Unionist parties and members of Sinn
Fein, legal political arm of the outlawed, mainly Catholic Irish
Republican Army.
   Five of those involved were treated in hospital for minor
injuries, said a press officer at Belfast police headquarters.
   The IRA is fighting to push the British out of this
Protestant-dominated province, join it with the Republic of Ireland
and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.

   Faulty wiring triggered an explosion that
consumed 20 minutes worth of fireworks in two minutes, forcing the
evacuation of tens of thousands of people from a downtown park on
Lake Superior, officials said.
   ``Everything went flying any which way,'' police officer Kevin
McKenna said following the Fourth of July accident Monday night.
   The blast sparked several small fires at Bayfront Park. A
spectator and two members of the fireworks crew were slightly
burned, police said.
   The area was barricaded, and police planned to stay through the
night as a precaution against any undetonated charges, said
Assistant Fire Chief Lou Gerard.
   ``There were about ten minutes worth of (normal) fireworks, then
all of a sudden it seemed like it exploded on the ground,'' said
Chris Maddy of Duluth radio station KDAL.
   ``Within seconds you could see a fireball that shot 50 feet into
the air. It looked like the fireworks in the sky, but they were on
the ground.
   ``There was no panic or anything,'' he said. ``In fact, the
Police Department had to urge people to leave. They all stood there
saying, `I can't believe what I just saw.' ''
   A charge failed to lift one of the fireworks out of its
canister, setting off a chain reaction that blew up 20 minutes
worth in two minutes, said Guy Gustafson of Arrowhead Inc. of
Duluth, which put on the show at Bayfront Park. Gustafson blamed
faulty wiring.

   It's widely said in the U.S. Navy that
any warship sooner or later takes on the character of its skipper.
But there's little about Capt. Will C. Rogers III to suggest he
commands what he calls ``the most sophisticated ship in the world,
bar none.''
   The ship, the missile cruiser USS Vincennes, and its skipper, a
soft-spoken, graying man in his mid-40s, are at the center of the
storm over the shooting down of an Iranian jetliner over the
Persian Gulf on Sunday.
   It was Rogers, from his console in the ship's darkened Command
Information Center, who ultimately gave the ``shoot'' order that
sent two SM-2 Standard missiles roaring off their deck launcher to
blast the plane from the sky.
   Only later did the United States admit that what the Vincennes'
officers had identified as an Iranian F-14 fighter diving on their
ship was in fact an Iran Air A300 Airbus with 290 people aboard.
   The captain and his tactical action officers will be called to
answer questions under oath before a team of top military and
technical experts arriving in the gulf today to investigate the
incident.
   In Rogers, they will find a man who, as one Navy officer said,
``has probably aged ten years in the last two days.''
   ``You cannot help but feel for the man,'' said another. ``The
first priority is protecting the ship, and it was his decision.
Once you fire them, you can't get 'em back.'' The officers spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Rogers, a native of Fort Worth, Texas, has a dry wit and so much
of the American southwest in his manner and voice that he spends a
lot of time denying he's related to the famous Oklahoma cowboy
humorist Will Rogers.
   ``I don't know how that rumor got started, but it isn't true.
Even my mother says so,'' he said recently when reporters visiting
his ship asked.
   The assumption is so widespread that some other officers were
surprised at the denial.
   Rogers has commanded the Vincennes for nearly two years and is
the 9,600-ton warship's second skipper. He and his wife Sharon,
also Fort Worth-born, live in San Diego, Calif., where the cruiser
is based.
   They have a son, Will C. Rogers IV.
   Rogers is a career Navy man, a graduate of the Navy's Officer
candidate school who has served aboard a variety of vessels from
mine sweepers to the aircraft carrier Independence.
   His first command, in the early 1970s, was the tiny
wooden-hulled mine sweeper Exploit. After later tours at the
Pentagon and navy staff college, plus other sea duty, he served as
skipper of the destroyer Cushing in 1981-84.
   The Vincennes, launched at the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula,
Miss. three years ago Wednesday, is the third of the Navy's
billion-dollar ``Aegis-type'' missile cruisers, designed to defend
an American battle fleet from air and missile attack.
   Its computer-linked surveillance and missile system is built
around ``phased-array'' radar, which can simultaneously identify
and evaluate the threat, if any, from dozens of targets.
   In the command information center, the targets appear not on the
usual round screens swept by a lighted wand but as fixed blips on
huge blue video screens where display features can be expanded or
reduced in size to provide a variety of instantaneous data.
   As if to anticipate a visitor's comment that the setting is an
electronic version of the ``Wizard of Oz,'' there's a sign on the
desk where Rogers sits that says, ``Hell, Toto, this ain't Kansas.''
   The Vincennes' ``gee-whiz merchandise,'' as Rogers calls it, is
tailored for multiple functions at the same time. Its powerful
radar system can help plan a battle or head off aerial threats
developing hundreds of miles away.
   But Rogers said no technology is foolproof or impervious to
failure. He said that if an attacker were to disable his ship's
computerized system, ``we're basically back to rocks and stones.''
   The Vincennes arrived in the gulf on May 27. As the first
Aegis-type cruiser assigned to the waterway sailed into it, Rogers
had difficulty in explaining for reporters why such a potent
warship is needed here.
   Finally, he said that ``putting this ship with its radar into
the gulf will put a lot of battle management on the scene. Maybe we
will be able to reduce the force level in the gulf and back away
from recent tensions in the gulf.''
   Of the Iranian threat, he said, ``Let's face it, it's a
low-level threat. We don't consider the Iranians an enemy. We're
not at war with them.''
   As the six-man team headed here to investigate the Iran Air
disaster, sources in Washington quoted Rogers as telling superiors
he had followed procedures, and that if he again faced the same
situation, he would take the same action.
   ``This is a burden that I will carry the rest of my life, but I
took this action to defend my ship and my crew. I alone am
responsible,'' he was reported as saying.

   The Coast Guard searched today for a
5-year-old boy missing from an overloaded boat that capsized in New
Bedford Harbor, drowning his baby sister, their mother and another
woman, officials said.
   Fifteen people were thrown into the water Monday night as the
22-foot boat was returning from a Fourth of July fireworks display,
said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Foley.
   Survivors said the boat capsized when it apparently hit another
boat's wake while making its way through heavy fog, Foley said.
   Eleven people were pulled safely from the water, he said.
   The boat ``was definitely overloaded,'' said Foley.
   Coast Guard vessels and private craft rescued the survivors.
``The fog was the main problem,'' Foley said. ``There was no
visibility. It was really socked in.''
   Divers found the body of a 1-year-old girl under the bow of the
boat and the bodies of her mother and another woman under the stern.
   Louise Hathaway, night supervisor at St. Luke's Hospital in New
Bedford, identified the victims as Jean Fauteaux, 50; Maria
Carvalho, 27; and her daughter, Melissa, 15 months, all of North
Dartmouth.
   She said Melissa's 5-year-old brother, Kenneth Carvalho, was
missing.
   Their sister, Amy Lynn Carvalho, 8, and Allan Viera Jr., 1, of
New Bedford were admitted to the hospital. Asked their conditions,
Hathaway said, ``They'll do fine.''
   Seven people were treated at the hospital and released, she said.

   Scattered thunderstorms dampened the Southeast today after rain
fell over the northern Rockies, the High Plains and western Oregon
and up to 18 inches of hail dropped on Montana.
   The strongest storms occurred Monday afternoon in Montana, when
dime-size hail piled up 2{ inches deep between Geyser and Stanford,
and up to 18 inches was reported in gullies near Colony.
   Scattered thunderstorms fell Monday night along a small area of
the High Plains from southwestern South Dakota and eastern Wyoming
through eastern Colorado into parts of New Mexico. Winds gusted to
61 mph at Redig, S.D. Thunderstorms also developed over North
Dakota, with winds gusting to 68 mph at Dickinson.
   Early today, thunderstorms continued to extend from northern
Georgia across much of Alabama into southern Mississippi. Near
Huntsville, Ala., just over a third of an inch of rain fell within
30 minutes.
   Much of the Plains and the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee
valleys had a very warm, humid night. Temperatures early today were
in the 70s and there were scattered readings in the 80s across the
central Plains.
   Record high temperatures for July 4 were set in a number of
communities, including 105 degrees at Aberdeen, S.D., a degree
higher than the 1936 record; 92 degrees at Buffalo, N.Y., beating
the 91-degree mark of 1897; and 89 at Duluth, Minn., topping the
88-degree record of 1948.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from Texas
to the lower Mississippi and lower Tennessee valleys to the south
Atlantic Coast, and for Minnesota, the western Great Plains and the
Rocky Mountain states, with showers and thunderstorms most numerous
in Alabama, the Florida Panhandle and southeast Louisiana; a few
showers were expected in Oregon and Washington; and sunshine in the
Northeast and much of the Southwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s or 90s across most

<HEAD>Party Sidesteps Gorbachev Call for Strong President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party conference approved Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's call for an overhaul of the legislature but did not
endorse his proposal for a strong presidency, according to a
resolution published today.
   In his speech last week opening the national conference he had
called, Gorbachev said, ``The president of the U.S.S.R. Supreme
Soviet should be granted sufficiently broad state authority powers.
   ``Specifically, the president could exercise overall guidance in
the drafting of legislation and of major socio-economic programs,
decide on the key issues of foreign policy, defense and national
security, chair the Defense Council'' and name the prime minister,
he said.
   That would have made the presidency, now a largely ceremonial
post, the locus of Soviet power. Most authority now rests with the
party general secretary _ Gorbachev _ and the party's ruling
Politburo.
   The resolutions adopted by the 5,000 delegates, as published
today by Soviet newspapers, were silent on the question of
presidential authority.
   The resolution on political reform did propose creation of a new
elective body, to be known as the Congress of People's Deputies,
which would meet annually to set general policy and elect members
of a smaller, full-time legislative council, the Supreme Soviet.
   The Supreme Soviet now has 1,500 members who meet twice a year
to give rubber-stamp approval to party policy.
   The resolution also would limit officials to two five-year terms
in the same party or government office, eliminating the common
practice of what amounts to lifetime tenure for many officials.
   The congress also would ``elect by secret ballot the president
of the Supreme Soviet,'' the document said. But it was silent on
what that officer's duties would be.
   Andrei A. Gromyko, the longtime Soviet foreign minister and
Politburo member, was elevated to the presidency of the Supreme
Soviet by Gorbachev, but he performs the largely ceremonial
functions of head of state while Gorbachev wields power as head of
the Politburo and the Defense Council.
   It was not immediately clear whether the 13-member Politburo had
moved to block Gorbachev's plan.
   A senior party spokesman told reporters Friday night, just after
the conference ended, that the delegates had approved Gorbachev's
proposal when they adopted seven resolutions in the final hours of
the four-day session.
   The spokesman, Central Committee Secretary Alexander Lukyanov,
said the party meeting, the first in 47 years, had agreed to the
proposal to give the powers Gorbachev requested to the president.
   He said the body also approved the general secretary's more
controversial plan to have the party leader at every level _ local,
regional, republic and national _ stand for election to head his or
her governmental council, or soviet. That would consolidate party
and government power in one person, who would have to be elected
not only by the party organization but by the lawmakers as well.
   Gorbachev did not specifically say the party general secretary
should seek the presidency, but Lukyanov said the conference made
the recommendation to apply to all levels, setting the stage for
Gorbachev to seek election to the new presidency next year.
   The texts of the resolutions were not made public until the day
after a special meeting of the ruling Politburo, which ordered
party and government bodies to act without delay in implementing
the conference directives.
   The Politburo also said a meeting of the policy-making Central
Committee would be held later this month to discuss how to
implement the proposed reforms.
   Another resolution says every Soviet citizen has an
``inalienable right'' to any information on public affairs but
state and military secrets.
   The delegates also said any citizen attacked in the press should
have the right to respond in the same newspaper and that the press
must not publish ``unobjective information injurious to a citizen's
honor and dignity.''
   Another resolution attached ``prime importance to improving
drastically food supplies to the population.'' The shortest route
to that goal, the conference said, is for bureaucrats to stop
meddling in the operations of collective and state farms.

<HEAD>Arabs Shut Down Gaza And Much Of West Bank With General Strike</HEAD>

   Palestinians shut down shops and transportation
in the occupied lands today in a PLO-ordered general strike, and
underground leaders of the uprising urged Arabs to step up civil
disobedience against Israeli rule.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded a 17-year-old Arab in the chest
today during a clash in the West Bank city of Nablus, said an
official at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital.
   An army spokesman said the soldiers opened fire after a group of
youths hurled rocks at them from a rooftop in the city's
marketplace. The hospital official identified the youth as Hatem
Kilani.
   Since the unrest began Dec. 8 against Israel's 21-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 215 Palestinians and
four Israelis have been killed.
   The army demolished two homes belonging to Arabs suspected of
staging firebomb attacks in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Israel
army radio and Arab witnesses said.
   ``We shall reach anyone, every place where a firebomb is thrown
... (where) a man has thrown a firebomb in cold blood, intending to
kill everyone here,'' Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir, a West Bank commander,
said on the radio.
   The violence came hours before the strike turned six Arab cities
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip _ Nablus, Gaza City, Hebron,
Jenin, Ramallah and Bethlehem _ into virtual ghost towns.
   Most of about 120,000 Palestinians employed in Israel also
stayed away from their jobs as part of a general strike ordered in
a leaflet last month by uprising leaders affliated with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, Arab news reports said.
   About 800 Arab schools in the West Bank were shut today as part
of a three-day closing ordered by the army on Monday in an an
attempt to prevent further violence.
   The school shutdown also came in response to instructions by
uprising leaders to rename ``all institutions and schools not
bearing Palestinian names'' today.
   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, who heads the West Bank military
government, said Monday the he hoped the closings ``would bring
home to students and parents that the current level of disturbances
is unacceptable.''
   Palestinians were also urged today to boycott military
government offices. But Arabs complied only partially after the
military summoned many to appear at its offices, apparently as a
counter-measure, Israel radio reported.
   In Bethlehem, hundreds of men and women were seen lining up in
front of the Israeli authorities' headquarters to obtain various
documents.
   But in the seaside Gaza Strip, a total strike was reported. An
Arab reporter in Gaza said he saw soldiers trying to order workers
to board buses to Israel in the Jabaliya refugee camp, but the men
refused. Jabaliya, a frequent trouble spot, is home to about 60,000
Palestinians.
   Two new leaflets distributed today urged Arabs to stage more
daylong general strikes throughout July to mark seven months of the
rebellion.
   The leaflets gave conflicting dates for the strikes, and it was
not immediately known whether they were distributed by rival
factions of the underground leadership.

   Iran's ambassador to West Germany
pledged today that his country will avenge a U.S. warship's downing
of an Iranian jetliner, but said retaliation will not occur on
American soil.
   ``We will not let this act go unanswered. We will give a direct
and clear response,'' said Ambassador Mehdi Ahary Mostafavi.
   Mostafavi was asked during a news conference if Iran would send
commandos to the United States to seek revenge for Sunday's downing
over the Persian Gulf of an Iran Air Airbus A300, whose 290
passengers and crew are all presumed dead.
   ``It was the Americans who came into our region, and we have the
right to defend ourselves there. We will not reverse the
situation,'' Mostafavi responded.
   Asked how Iran would reply to Sunday's disaster, he said, ``We
will give our answer to the aggressor himself.''
   The United States said officers aboard the warship mistook the
A300 for an Iranian F-14 fighter and shot it down after it failed
to respond to seven warnings.

Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With society's increased attention on the
environmental threat posed by toxic compounds, Tufts University
plans to begin the nation's first collegiate program in hazardous
waste management.
   ``We've received a lot of support from industry because there's
no other program like this in the country right now,'' Gene Blake,
asociate director of Tufts Center for Environmental Management,
said in a prepared announcement.
   ``There's a real need for it,'' he said.
   The interdisciplinary master's degree course to be announced
today is designed to educate students on issues related to
hazardous waste and will focus on environmental health, science,
policy and technology, said school officials.
   Representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
Audobon Society, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Quality Engineering and several engineering consultants and Tufts
faculty members will develop the curriculum before classes start
next fall.
   The EPA has targeted hundreds of sites across the country for
cleanup of hazardous materials under its Superfund program.
   ``We're hearing from government and citizens groups that it's
hard to find good people aware of the issues surrounding current
policy, technology and research,'' Blake said.
   Linfield C. Brown, chairman of Tufts' civil engineering
department, said students will be required to have some background
in calculus, chemistry and biology, but the program will focus on
risk assessment, management and communication, health effects and
environmental management regulations.
   Blake said the new venture is designed to do more than just
teach students how to clean up hazardous waste sites.
   ``We want to teach people how to avoid waste problems in the
first place,'' Blake said.
   For a final one semester course, all students will be placed in
small teams to act as consultants and meet with federal and state
officials to develop solutions for existing environmental
management or policy problems.
   Tufts Department of Urban and Environmental Policy is assisting
in development of the new program. Students can complete the
program in one year full-time, or in three years on a part-time
basis.

<HEAD>Ben Briscoe Follows Father to Become Dublin's 2nd Jewish Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like father like son, Ben Briscoe has
become Lord Mayor of Dublin, the second Jew to hold the office.
   His late father, Robert Briscoe, was elected lord mayor in 1956
and proved such a hit that he was given a second term in 1961.
   Ben Briscoe, 55, took over the gold chain of office from
Carmencita Hederman after defeating her 28-22 in a city council
vote Monday night.
   It was the first time a son has followed his father into the
Mansion House, Dublin's mayoral residence, and Briscoe is assured
of added prominence because he takes office midway through
celebrations of the capital's millennium.
   The office, which carries a one-year term, is largely ceremonial
and customarily is rotated. But Mrs. Hederman, the first woman
elected to the post, was such a popular mayor that she sought a
second term, saying she wanted to see the millennium festivities
out.
   But the 25 city councilors of Briscoe's Fianna Fail party, plus
three from small parties, tipped the balance against her.
   The Briscoes, something of a dynasty among Ireland's
2,000-member Jewish population, have served Fianna Fail in
Parliament without interruption since 1927.
   Ben Briscoe was elected to the Dail in 1965, taking over the
Dublin seat his father held until his death. He is one three Jews
in the 166-member parliament.
   ``This is one of the proudest moments of my life,'' he said
after the votes were counted making him lord mayor.

<HEAD>Soccer Finals To Be Played In United States In 1994</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Cup soccer championship
finals will be held in the United States for the first time ever in
1994, the international soccer association decided.
   The U.S. bid to stage the event, held every four years, won over
bids by Brazil and Morocco. Possible sites for the title match
include Miami; Pasadena, Calif.; and Kansas City, Mo.
   U.S. delegates clapped and cheered Monday when Harry Cavan,
senior vice president of the Federation Internationale de Football
Association, announced the tally after a morning filled with
meetings by the international soccer governing body's executive
committee.
   ``Obviously the first instant reaction is relief,'' said U.S.
Soccer Federation President Werner Fricker. ``The decision is made.
After that, I guess the next thing is `What's next?'''
   After the announcement, Cavan said: ``I noticed the U.S.
delegation in its presentation used the word `football.' I was
quite happy about that because I have been trying for years to get
them to do that.''
   The U.S. presentation also included a videotaped message from
President Reagan.
   As host, the United States automatically qualifies for the 1994
World Cup. The four-week, 52-match tournament will be the biggest
undertaking ever for American soccer, which Fricker said has made
``unbelievable'' progress in the past decade.
   ``We're not as successful as other soccer powers, but we've
played the game for about 100 years,'' he said. ``The American
public is interested in all major sporting events. We expect to
fill all stadiums to about 80 percent capacity.''
   The 1986 World Cup was held in Mexico, while the 1990
competition is to be held in Italy.

   The discovery of a poison-filled syringe in a
carton of orange juice led supermarket officials to pull the
brand's entire stock of juice from shelves, police said.
   No injuries were reported in the Monday incident, police Officer
Bill Frio said. A customer alerted store officials to the syringe
found inside a 64-ounce cardboard carton of Minute Maid juice,
according to Frio.
   Tests by an independent laboratory confirmed the device was
filled with a poisonous substance, West Valley police spokesman Jim
McClurg said today. The type of poison found would not be revealed
until a police lab test was conducted, he added.
   Daryl Byrum, a manager at the Vons store in Woodland Hills,
declined comment on the incident early today.

<HEAD>Sailor's Court-Martial Set To Begin This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYPORT NAVAL AIR STATION, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys are preparing
for the court-martial of a Navy sailor facing murder and robbery
charges in the slaying of a payroll officer on board ship.
   Once pretrial motions are completed this week, a court-martial
panel will be selected for the trial of Petty Officer 1st Class
Ruben Colon, officials said.
   Colon, 34, is charged in the shooting death of Lt. j.g. Ratish
Prasad, the disbursing officer of the USS Hancock, and with
stealing more than $94,000 from the ship's safe. Charges against
Colon include murder, robbery, kidnapping and receipt of stolen
property.
   Colon faces the death penalty if found guilty. The last time the
Navy executed one of its own was in 1849, when two brothers were
hanged in San Francisco for mutiny, desertion and assaulting an
officer.
   A pretrial hearing began June 20. U.S. Magistrate Harvey E.
Schlesinger is scheduled to testify today as the hearing's final
witness.
   Colon's attorney, Lt. Matthew Michels, has argued that
Schlesinger should not have issued a federal warrant to naval
investigators to search three bank safe-deposit boxes based on an
erroneous affidavit. Michels contends the seized items should not
be admitted into evidence.
   One of the safe-deposit boxes held more than $87,000 in cash and
2,575 blank U.S. Treasury checks imprinted with the name of the
Mayport-based destroyer. All three boxes had been rented in Colon's
name, investigators said.
   The checks and $94,629 were reported stolen from the Hancock on
March 15, the day Prasad's body was discovered in a sea-bag locker.
   Prasad, 24, was bound, gagged, choked, and shot in the head at
point-blank range with a .38-caliber handgun, investigators said.
   Colon, a Navy technician from Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, has been
held at the brig at Jacksonville Naval Air Station since his arrest
April 12 aboard the Hancock.
   Opening arguments in the trial are set to begin Wednesday or
Thursday at the Fleet Training Center, according to Navy officials.

<TEXT>
   The sister of an American who has been held
hostage in Lebanon since 1985 says she feels empathy for the
relatives of the 290 people killed when an Iranian jetliner was
shot down by a U.S. missile.
   ``I know what it is to be an innocent victim,'' said Peggy Say,
sister of hostage Terry Anderson. ``Here we have 290 grieving
families that were caught up in something outside of themselves the
same as we have been. My heart goes out to them.''
   She added: ``I think we have to apologize over and over again. I
don't think we can apologize enough for something like this.''
   Mrs. Say, meeting with reporters at her new home near here
Monday, declined to say whether she agreed with the United States'
Persian Gulf policy, but she said she hoped the United States would
re-examine its policy.
   ``The question I've been asking myself, just as an American, is
how we could make such a horrendous mistake,'' she said.
   All 290 people aboard the jetliner were killed.
   Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985, in Beirut, Lebanon.
He is one of nine Americans believed held captive by factions with
ties to Iran and has been held the longest of any American.
   Mrs. Say said she feared the incident would harm any current
effort to gain the release of her brother and the other hostages.
   ``I'm very concerned, yet hoping and praying that they (in Iran)
will be able to understand that this has nothing to do with these
hostages,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Zwelakhe Sisulu, the detained
editor of the New Nation newspaper, has been hospitalized and is
being treated for depression, his attorney said today.
   Sisulu, 37, was taken Friday from Diepkloof Prison in the black
township of Soweto and admitted to Johannesburg Hospital, said his
attorney, Priscilla Jana.
   ``I visited him this morning. He is still depressed and he's
lost a lot of weight,'' she said.
   Sisulu has been detained without charge since December 1986, and
courts have rejected requests that the government charge or release
him.
   During his detention, the 2-year-old newspaper, which is
published for black readers by the South African Catholic Bishops
Conference, was banned for three months. It resumed publication
last week.
   Government officials have said Sisulu was being detained because
of his journalistic activities and because he was allegedly a
member of the National Education Crisis Committee. Sisulu denied
that he was a member of the committee, which is legal and
unrestricted, but the court upheld the police's right to hold him
under national emergency regulations.
   Sisulu, who studied at Harvard University under a Nieman
Fellowship, is the son of imprisoned African National Congress
leader Walter Sisulu.
   His brother, Thabo, is chief spokesman for the outlawed ANC in
Lusaka, Zambia, and his mother, Albertina, is a co-president of the
banned United Democratic Front, an anti-apartheid group. She is
prohibited from giving news interviews or speeches.
   Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a glance at events following Sunday's destruction of an
Iran Air Airbus 300 by the USS Vincennes:
   
   IN THE GULF
   _ In Beirut, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual
guide for Iranian-backed guerrillas holding foreign captives, was
quoted as saying the hostages should not suffer because of the
attack. An anonymous caller claiming to speak for Islamic Jihad,
which holds Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland,
threatened to kill one of them in revenge for Sunday's attack.
   _Iranian divers searched the Persian Gulf for bodies from the
Airbus A300 that was destroyed by a U.S. Navy missile. The bodies
of more than half the 290 people reported aboard were recovered.
   _ A team of Navy investigators left for the gulf to begin
reconstructing the incident. The Navy says the Airbus was mistaken
for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter.
   _ Capt. Will C. Rogers III, commander of the Vincennes, told his
superiors he had followed proper procedures and would make the same
decisions in the same situation again.
   
   IN IRAN
   _ Iranian leaders demanded revenge and threatened war. Scenes of
protest demonstrations appeared on television, and mass funerals
were scheduled.
   ``We must all be prepared for a real war and go to the war
fronts and fight against America and its lackeys. I donate my
worthless life for the sake of our victory,'' said Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   _ Mehdi Ahary Mostafavi, Iran's ambassador to West Germany,
pledged today, ``We will not let this act go unanswered. We will
give a direct and clear response.'' He said retaliation will not
occur on American soil.
   
   THE ADMINISTRATION
   _ President Reagan scoffed at Iranian claims that the Navy
deliberately fired at a civilian jetliner, held fast to his policy
of defending the right of free navigation and said U.S. ships will
stay in the Persian Gulf.
   
   CONGRESS
   _ Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said ``the policy of trying to
protect commercial shipping in the Gulf is absolutely right.''
   _ U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said in London that
President Reagan should be more apologetic for the incident and
that Congress would favor compensating Iran for the tragedy.
   _ Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said the administration should
review its Gulf policy because the next time a tragedy occurs,
American lives may be lost.
   
   CANDIDATES
   _ Vice President George Bush, virtually certain to take the
Republican nomination for president, expressed his regrets but said
the incident should not change U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.
   _ The Democrats' probable nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, urged Iran to reconsider its threats to avenge the Iranian
jetliner.
   _ Democratic contender Jesse Jackson urged Reagan to offer
reparations to the families of victims of the downed jet.
   
   AROUND THE WORLD
   _ In Montreal, Iran asked the International Civil Aviation
Organization to immediately begin an investigation, but officials
of the U.N. agency said they need more information, particularly
from the United States, first.
   Most governments appeared to view the incident as the kind of
tragedy made virtually inevitable by eight years of war between
Iran and Iraq.
   _ In London, American flags were removed from a terminal at
London's Heathrow Airport for U.S. flights. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government expressed sorrow but said it understood the
reasons, but some lawmakers deplored the deadly attack.
   _ Moscow radio said the U.S. Navy committed ``deliberate mass
murder,'' but a Soviet official said his nation would not emulate
the ``wild'' American criticism that followed the Soviet Union's
downing of a Korean Air Lines jet.
   _ Arab nations renewed their call for an end to the conflict
that has turned the entire waterway into a war zone.
   _ Greece put the onus on the United States, but Washington's
allies in Europe generally used the occasion to call for an end to
the Iran-Iraq war.
   _ Japan Air Lines and Cathay Pacific Airways announced route
changes on flights around the Persian Gulf to avoid trouble.
   
   UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
   _ How could the Vincennes mistake a large civilian plane, the
Airbus, for a small, highly maneuverable jet fighter like the F-14?
   _ Was the Iranian plane inside or outside a recognized
commercial air corridor?
   _ Was the airplane descending from 9,000 feet in what seemed to
be an attack, as the Navy says, or climbing from 7,500 feet after
takeoff, as Iran says?
   _ Did the plane have a working transponder that would have
identified it as civilian?
   _ Why did the plane ignore warnings broadcast by the Vincennes?

   The Defense Ministry said today
Nicaraguan rebels ambushed a military jeep and a truck carrying
civilians, killing 12 people. It was the deadliest attack since a
cease-fire pact was signed in March.
   Seven civilians and five military men were killed in the raid
Monday in Buenos Aires, a village about 100 miles east of Managua,
said a military spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The spokeswoman said 10 other people _ two civilians and eight
soldiers _ were injured when the U.S.-backed rebels known as
Contras attacked the vehicles with an anti-tank mine, rifle fire
and rocket-propelled grenades.
   Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales said he did not have any
information on the attack but added: ``Our units have instructions
not to attack but to defend themselves. I am seriously concerned
about this campaign to create incidents to justify whatever action
against our units.''
   Rosales noted that Defense Minister Humberto Ortega threatened
the Contra leaders if they failed to sign a treaty during the last
round of talks in June and said the latest report ``reflects those
threats.''
   It was the deadliest attack since the leftist Sandinistas and
the rebels agreed March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the
war. More than 26,000 people have died since the insurgency began
in 1981.
   The government and the rebels have reported sporadic violations
of the truce, and a series of talks failed to advance the
agreement. No new talks were scheduled.
   The Sandinistas came to power in 1979 after a war that deposed
President Anastasio Somoza.

<TEXT>
   A man who wrote to an employee of his
love for her and once massaged her neck and shoulder at work did
not commit sexual harassment, the Minnesota Court of Appeals has
ruled.
   The 2-1 opinion, which was to be filed today, upheld the
Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training's award of unemployment
benefits to Richard L. Gradine, who worked at the College of St.
Scholastica.
   The agency decided Gradine's conduct constituted ``misguided
infatuation,'' rather than sexual harassment, which would have made
him ineligible for jobless benefits. The appeals court agreed.
   Gradine, 43, was an assistant plant supervisor at the college
from March 1987 until July 23, when he was fired immediately after
the employee, a student, complained.
   According to court documents, Gradine for a time supervised the
student, but she was transferred after other student workers
complained she was receiving preferential treatment.
   After the transfer, Gradine wrote her a letter saying he had
strong personal feelings of affection and love for her, according
to court records.
   Gradine came to the student's work place and massaged her neck
and shoulder, court records state. When the woman told him to stop,
he did, according to documents.
   Later that day, a note the woman had written the day before was
delivered to Gradine, in which she told him she wanted no further
contact with him, court documents state.
   A referee for the Jobs and Training Department determined that
Gradine was discharged for misconduct, and therefore disqualified
from receiving unemployment benefits.
   But the Jobs and Training commissioner reversed that decision.
The commissioner refused to characterize Gradine's conduct as
sexual harassment because the student had not clearly rejected
Gradine's overtures and because Gradine was not aware that his
touching was unwelcome, the court said.
   In the court opinion, Judge Thomas Forsberg noted that
definitions of sexual harassment in the unemployment compensation
and human rights statutes require that a perpetrator's actions be
unwelcome.
   Judge Daniel Foley sharply disagreed, writing, ``The majority
would have us believe this is nothing serious, it is just something
that happens in the workplace. Who established the standard that
women employees must accept this kind of conduct? And who
established the standard that the employer's compensation fund must
be charged for that conduct?''

   The banana split was for people, so Zoo Atlanta's
elder ape made do with a honeydew and other fruit at his 30th
birthday party.
   About 500 people turned out for the Fourth of July celebration
opposite Willie B.'s new outdoor habitat at the zoo's African rain
forest.
   For the human celebrants, there was a vast concoction billed as
the world's biggest banana split, whipped together under a circus
tent and handed out free to visitors.
   Willie B. received a generous basket of fruit, which he lugged
to the edge of a moat. ``Oooh,'' cried a child. ``Looka the big
monkey!''
   The great ape downed five bananas for starters, dropping the
peels carefully in front of him, then gobbled a few clusters of red
grapes, followed by an apple and a couple of handfuls of
strawberries.
   Surveying the onlookers with a benign air, Willie B. put away a
couple of cantaloupes, licking the rinds clean. Ignoring the onset
of a steady drizzle of rain, he dipped into the basket for a
cluster of green grapes, which he ate daintily, grape by grape,
with obvious pleasure.
   Some in the crowd sang ``Happy Birthday.''
   No one knows what day the 459-pound gorilla was born, since he
was captured as an infant in Africa. He's been at Zoo Atlanta since
he was about 3. Gorillas in captivity usually live to be about 45.

   President Ali Khamenei of Iran said today
his country has the right to avenge the victims of the Iran Air
jetliner shot down by the U.S. Navy, Tehran Radio reported.
   He did not say if, how or when Tehran would seek revenge. Iran
said all 290 people aboard the aircraft were killed in Sunday's
missile attack by the USS Vincennes.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as saying:
``Iran considers it to be its definite right to avenge the blood of
innocent children, men and women.''
   Iran's military commander-in-chief, Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, declared in another report on Tehran Radio: ``We cannot
allow ourselves to refrain from taking revenge. The choice of
timing is up to us, and not to America.''
   The radio said Rafsanjani called the downing of the plane ``an
unprecedented disaster.''
   Also today, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah was quoted as
saying in Beirut that Western hostages in Lebanon should not suffer
because of the missile attack on the Iran Air jet. Fadlallah is
spirtual guide for Hezbollah, the Shiite Moslem group believed to
be an umbrella for the captors of most of the 18 foreign hostages
in Lebanon.
   However, an anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic
Jihad, which holds Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland,
threatened to kill one of them in revenge. It was not possible to
authenticate the call. Islamic Jihad has said it would authenticate
its statements with photographs of the hostages.
   A U.S. State Department official in Washington, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said ``there is no confirmation there is
any connection to Hezbollah or that this is a legitimate thing.''
   In Tehran, mass funeral services were scheduled today and
Wednesday for some of those killed in the attack.
   Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 87,
vowed Monday to dedicate his ``worthless life'' to fighting the
United States. His designated heir, Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, called for total war.
   Foreign Minister Ali-Akhbar Velayati said Iran's revenge would
extend to countries that have helped the United States in the
Persian Gulf. He did not elaborate.
   Iranian divers searched for more bodies from the Iran Air Airbus
A300, which was destroyed on a 150-mile flight from the Iranian
city of Bandar Abbas to Dubai, across the Strait of Hormuz in the
United Arab Emirates.
   Tehran radio quoted a senior official of the state-run Iran Air
as saying 200 bodies had been recovered.
   In another Iranian report, an unidentified commander of the
search and rescue operation was quoted as saying the bodies had
been recovered up to five miles from the area where most of the
jetliner's debris fell. It was hit at 7,500 feet by at least one of
two missiles fired by the Vincennes.
   According to the Iranian reports, the bodies of 38 non-Iranians
have been recovered _ 12 United Arab Emirates citizens, eight
Indians, eight Pakistanis, six Yugoslavs, two Kuwaitis, an Italian
and an Afghan.
   The United States said the crew of the cruiser Vincennes mistook
the plane for an Iranian F-14 fighter and said it failed to respond
to seven radio warnings.
   An Italian naval spokesman said today that an Italian frigate in
the gulf heard the Vincennes radioing an approaching aircraft,
requesting identification and change of course. However, the
spokesman, Capt. Alfredo Saitto, said the Italian ship could not
determine whether the Iranian airliner was flying outside the
commercial air corridor, as Italian officials had said Monday.
   In Dubai, about 400 mourners gathered Monday for a memorial
service at a Shiite mosque and regularly burst into chants of
``Death to America.''
   On Tehran radio Monday, Khomeini said: ``We must all be prepared
for a real war and go to the war fronts and fight against America
and its lackeys. I donate my worthless life for the sake of our
victory.''
   Khomeini is rumored to be in poor health or near death, but the
radio did not explain what he meant by his last comment.
   Iran accuses the United States of backing Iraq in its nearly
8-year-old war with Iran.

<HEAD>Studio Chief Criticizes Proposed Interim Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for striking writers say a
proposed interim agreement is the best hope for resuming
production, but the chief of Paramount Studios said the plan would
extend the 18-week-old strike.
   ``The latest interim agreement promulgated by the Writers Guild
of America indicates a strike-prolonging retrenchment at a time
when they should be seeking a solution,'' Frank Mancuso said in a
statement Monday.
   Mancuso, spokesman for the executive committee of the Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers, is the first major
studio head to speak out against the strike that has paralyzed much
of the film and television industry.
   His statement came two days before 9,000 guild members are to
vote on an interim agreement already approved by the union
leadership that allows script writers to sign deals with
independent producers.
   ``There's a vote coming up Wednesday and he wants the writers to
take stock of where they are,'' alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg
said. ``And he also wants the independent producers to understand
that this interim agreement has some fishhooks in it.''
   Steinberg said his group warned independent producers that the
interim agreement would cost them more in residual payments than
the alliance offer now on the table.
   The proposed agreement would also allow writers to buy back
scripts that are not used for film production, Steinberg said.
   Two settlement proposals offered by the alliance have been
rejected by the writers.
   So far, 118 independent companies have signed deals with Writers
Guild members under both the old contract and the proposed interim
agreement.
   Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said the interim proposal would
allow many production companies to resume work.
   ``We are unfortunately trying to negotiate with a leadership of
the companies that has chosen to spend more money to stay on strike
than it would cost to settle,'' Ms. Rhoden said.

   Jesse Jackson laid out a detailed case today for
why he should be offered the vice presidential spot on the
Democratic ticket and dismissed others under consideration as
``unknown quantities.''
   He refused to say whether he would accept the position if it is
offered, however.
   ``No one else has had to pass the same tests,'' Jackson told
reporters the morning after his Fourth of July meeting with
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who is in the process of
selecting a running mate.
   ``I bring the sense of creativity, a new history,'' Jackson said.
   He refused to say whether he pushed himself for the vice
presidential nomination during his dinner meeting with Dukakis and
also refused, as he has for two weeks, to make public whether he
would accept the No. 2 spot.
   But he listed numerous attributes he said made him uniquely
qualified among the handful of people being considered to share the
ticket with Dukakis, principally his participation in the lengthy
primary season, during which he attracted nearly 7 million votes.
   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond
their districts and beyond their home states,'' Jackson said.
   He was departing for New York this morning but left behind top
aides who were to meet with Dukakis campaign aides to discuss
convention issues.
   Jackson spoke to reporters today after giving an
uncharacteristic ``no comment'' when asked Monday night if the vice
presidency was a topic of his discussions with Dukakis.
   Jackson and his wife Jacqueline had dinner with Dukakis and his
wife Kitty, and the two couples attended a Boston Pops concert and
watched a fireworks display.
   On Monday, before flying to Boston for his meeting with Dukakis,
Jackson said the Reagan administration should examine its ``failed
and vague policy'' in the Persian Gulf following the U.S. Navy's
downing of an Iranian airliner.
   Warning that the lives of American hostages in Lebanon are in
danger, Jackson appealed Monday to President Reagan to go on
television to apologize for the incident and ``offer reparations to
the (victims') families to ease some of their pain.''
   Reagan on Monday repeated his sorrow over the lives lost, but
said he would await the results of a Pentagon investigation before
making decisions on matters such as reparations.
   ``I am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill
immediately so as to protect the lives of Americans who are in the
region, specifically the Americans who are held hostage there,''
Jackson said in Chicago .
   Jackson made his remarks during a brief news conference at his
Chicago home.
   Jackson said the shooting incident complicates the situation in
the gulf at a time when there are indications that forces in Iran
favoring negotiations are gaining strength.

   Pope John Paul II said today he was ``deeply
distressed'' over the downing of an Iranian airliner and urged that
steps be taken to prevent such an incident from occurring again.
   In a telegram sent in his name by Vatican Secretary of State
Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the pope expressed his condolences to
Iranian officials and families of those killed when the U.S.
cruiser Vincennes shot down the Iranian Airbus over the Persian
Gulf on Sunday. Iran said all 290 people aboard were killed.
   ``Deeply distressed by the tragedy that provoked the death of so
many passengers and crew members of a civilian Iranian plane, the
pope ... asks you to express his deepest condolences to the Iranian
authorities, and through them, to the families in mourning,'' said
the telegram, addressed to the Holy See's ambassador in Tehran.
   The pope urged ``that everything is done so that similar
tragedies are not repeated and that all efforts are made so that
the region rediscovers the peace to which all the world aspires.''

   A Vietnamese immigrant selected to design
the state's Vietnam Veterans Memorial says he wants to show
veterans and his adopted country his gratitude.
   ``I want to thank the country for taking us in and making us
Americans,'' said Hien T. Nguyen at a ceremony Monday at the Garden
State Arts Center where the memorial will be built.
   ``I feel like I've done something good,'' said Nguyen, a
35-year-old architect from Marlboro whose entry was selected from
425 proposals.
   Referring to the nation's Vietnam veterans, he said, ``If not
for them, I might not be here today. They gave us new life. We are
the lucky ones.''
   He said he will donate his $5,000 award to efforts to return
MIAs to the United States and reunite Amerasian children with their
U.S. parents.
   Nguyen's award-winning design features an oval with a
200-foot-diameter set flat on the ground. A 9-foot high panel of
black granite lining the interior will be inscribed with the names
of 1,419 New Jersey residents killed in Vietnam and another 63
listed as missing in action. A New Jersey oak tree will stand in
the center of the two-tiered memorial.
   About 200 veterans and their families at the ceremony applauded
Nguyen's work. Some in uniforms embraced the architect.
   Nguyen, who become a U.S. citizen five years ago, was evacuated
from Saigon in an American airlift on April 30, 1975 with his
mother and sister. The family was taken to a refugee camp in
Arkansas before Nguyen moved to Blacksburg, Va., where his brother
Han was a student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
   Nguyen, an architecture student in Saigon, received an
undergraduate degree in the field from VPI and went to New Jersey
with his brother, who works for AT&T's Bell Labs. His parents live
in Montreal.
   Funding for Nguyen's $2.5 million design will come from a
variety of sources, including veterans' groups, private
corporations and the state, said state Sen. Edward O'Connor,
D-Hudson, chairman of the memorial committee.
   In Salt Lake City, meanwhile, ground was broken Monday for a
memorial to the 364 Vietnam War dead or MIAS from Utah.
   Utah County Commissioner Brent Morris, a Vietnam veteran and
Purple Heart recipient, said during a ceremony at the state capitol
that the memorial would help release years of bitterness.
   The Utah monument will feature an 8-foot statue of a young
infantryman slogging through a rice paddy, carrying his own rifle
and that of a fallen comrade. The monument will be 60 feet in
diameter with four polished black marble plaques listing the names
of Utah's MIAs and dead.
   The organization behind the monument, the Utah Vietnam Era
Veteran's Memorial Committee, has raised almost $70,000 to fund the
project and hopes to reach its goal of $231,000 by year's end.

   Secretary of State George Shultz left today on
a 2{-week trip that will take him to nine Pacific and East Asian
nations, with defense and trade issues at the top of his agenda.
   The series of meetings begins with a three-day ministerial
summit of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in
Bangkok, Thailand, starting Thursday.
   The U.S. downing of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard
is bound to come up in his meetings with foreign leaders. The
Persian Gulf is a strategically sensitive area, and governments
around the world are eager to see a negotiated settlement of the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Shultz plans to discuss issues including American military bases
in the region, U.S. trade deficits with the area's emerging
industrial powers and the future of Cambodia as it moves toward
independence following a 10-year Vietnamese occupation.
   Shultz' trip will be his last and longest to the Pacific rim as
secretary of state. After Thailand, he plans to visit Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan
and the new Marshall Islands Republic.
   While in China, Shultz hopes to win assurances that the Chinese
will not support any attempt by the Khmer Rouge to regain control
of Cambodia. The communist group was blamed for the deaths of
millions of Cambodians in purges and forced relocations in the
1970s.
   The Khmer Rouge government was dismantled by Vietnamese
occupation forces, which have now begun to withdraw from Cambodia.

   A West German Air Force F-4 Phantom
fighter jet crashed into a field and exploded today, seconds after
its two pilots ejected to safety, police said.
   The crash is the latest in a series of military flight accidents
in West Germany since March.
   Police said the jet went down 12 miles south of Stade, about 25
miles west of the northern port city of Hamburg.
   One pilot was slightly injured, officials said.
   The area where the jet crashed is the scene of frequent
low-level military training flights.
   Citizens and environmental groups have protested the flights. A
local newspaper recently reported that a man had to be buried
without final graveside services because the pastor could not make
himself heard over the din of low-flying jets.
   On Sunday, a West German army helicopter crashed into a cliff in
Bavaria state, killing all nine aboard.
   On Friday, a civilian-owned airplane under contract with the
West German army crashed into a house in northern Germany, killing
the pilot.
   Three U.S. Air Force F-16s crashed last Wednesday. One pilot was
killed when two of the jets collided in flight. F-16s also crashed
March 31 and April 18.
   The accidents led opponents of low-level military training
flights to renew calls that they be eliminated or sharply reduced.
   West Germany's new defense minister, Rupert Scholz, said last
week that he would make the problem of low-level flights a top
priority.
   U.S. officials said the F-16s involved in last Wednesday's
crashes were not on low-level flight missions.

   More than 3,000 people chanting
``Down with the government!'' today marched through the streets of
this central Yugoslav town demanding higher wages, witnesses and
the Tanjug news agency said.
   Most of the demonstrators are workers at a major Yugoslav shoe
factory, Borovo, who went on strike Saturday to protest the partial
payment of their June wages, the agency said.
   The government in May linked wages to the low industrial
productivity as part of an austerity program designed to cut
Yugoslavia's 175 percent inflation rate and its $21 billion foreign
debt.
   Several witnesses in Vukovar, about 60 miles west of Belgrade,
told The Associated Press that the demonstrators, who carried
Yugoslav flags as well as Communist Party banners, demanded a
change in the country's leadership.
   The strike was the latest in a series of recent protests across
the country against the government's economic measures.
   Yugoslavia registered a record 1,600 strikes last year,
involving over 300,000 workers.

   The public ranks the quality of education as
the No. 1 issue in this year's presidential campaign, according to
a Gallup Poll being released today.
   Asked to rate 13 foreign and domestic policy issues on a scale
of 1-5, with 5 representing a ``most important issue,'' 77 percent
rated public education at least a 4.
   Sixty-six percent of the 2,113 Americans surveyed by telephone
between March 31 and April 20 said they would be more likely to
support a candidate who favored increased federal aid to public
schools.
   But only 43 percent of those polled favored increasing teachers'
salaries if that means higher taxes.
   Those were among the findings of an annual survey of public
attitudes about school issues commissioned by the National
Education Association, the 1.9 million-member teacher union holding
its annual convention here this week.
   ``The American people understand the need for change. And they
clearly indicate, in this poll, that they want to make education a
national priority,'' NEA executive director Don Cameron said at a
news conference today.
   In San Francisco on Monday, delegates to the American Federation
of Teachers' annual convention re-elected Albert Shanker unopposed
to his eighth two-year term as president of the 677,000-member
union.
   The 3,000 delegates were to end their four-day meeting today
after listening to a talk via satellite from Boston by Michael
Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential nominee.
   In the poll, drugs ranked second in importance behind education,
with 75 percent rating drugs 4 or 5. Sixty-nine percent rated U.S.
ability to compete economically and technologically as a critical
issue.
   The federal deficit and homelessness each were cited as most
important by 67 percent, and AIDS by 66 percent.
   Twenty-nine percent said ``politicians and public officials not
doing enough to provide necessary funding'' is the chief obstacle
to school reform. School administrators who ``can't decide on the
right way to achieve the goals of reform'' were blamed by 25
percent. Only 16 percent blamed teachers or teacher unions.
   Seventy-one percent felt schools are having trouble attracting
new teachers. But 68 percent opposed lowering standards by allowing
college graduates with no formal teacher training to work in public
schools.
   The poll had a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 2
percentage points.
   It was released a day after 8,227 NEA delegates overwhelmingly
endorsed NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell's pet proposal that
urged the naming of at least one school district per state as
``learning laboratories'' where teachers or anyone else with good
ideas could freely experiment and take the lead in creating better
schools.
   AFT delegates ratified a similar program of school
experimentation, calling for establishment of thousands of
``schools within schools'' where groups of six or more teachers
could try innovative ideas free of bureaucratic meddling.
   Both proposals drew immediate criticism from Assistant U.S.
Secretary of Education Chester Finn.
   ``That they are willing to admit that things aren't hunky-dory
in schools, that much is good,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``But the bad part is that they seem to suggest that we need to
have a vast experiment, as if we didn't know or have the faintest
idea of what works in schools.''
   Even some teachers expressed doubts about the NEA reform
proposal.
   ``I'm a little afraid that it may be just another experiment. It
could be limited to districts that are already innovating,'' said
Kathleen Conklin, who teaches English at Malcolm X. Shabazz High
School in Madison, Wis.
   The NEA gathering hit an emotional peak with an appearance by
16-year-old Ryan White, the boy with AIDS who gained national
attention with his fight to have a normal public school education.
   ``Teachers can play an important role in helping an AIDS student
be accepted and treated as normal as possible by teaching the
facts, not the myths,'' he said. ``By proper education, AIDS can be
a disease, not a dirty word.''

   Pentagon officials who touted the Aegis ship
defense system as the most sophisticated in the world are
scrambling to explain why it couldn't tell the difference between a
large Airbus jetliner and a far smaller F-14 attack jet.
   That will be one of the issues examined by an official
investigation team headed by Rear Adm. William N. Fogarty, who is
en route to the Persian Gulf to find out what happened.
   The cruiser Vincennes shot down Iran Air flight 655 in the
mistaken belief that it was an attacking Iranian F-14, according to
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The incident came shortly after the Vincennes had fired at
Iranian patrol boats that U.S. officers believed had attacked the
ship's helicopter, which was flying patrols in the Strait of Hormuz.
   It was unclear whether the Airbus was descending in a
threatening manner, as the Vincennes skipper apparently believed,
or whether the jet actually was climbing when it was shot down.
   The Washington Post today quoted Pentagon sources whom it did
not identify as saying that a report filed Monday by another U.S.
Navy ship, the frigate Sides, said the Iranian plane was climbing,
as Iran has claimed. The Post said officials did not know whether
the report from the Sides, or other from the Vincennes saying the
Iranian plane was descending toward the ship in a pattern similar
to one an attacking plane would make, was accurate.
   The Vincennes is equipped with the Aegis system, which the Navy
has touted as the world's most sophisticated and complex electronic
defense.
   In praising Aegis, naval officials have said it would permit
Navy vessels to track more potential enemy planes at greater
distances.
   The European-built Airbus is far larger than the F-14, which the
United States sold to Iran during the reign of the shah. The Airbus
is 177 feet long, compared to only 62 feet for the F-14.
   Crowe said that difference was less apparent because the Iranian
plane was coming straight at the Vincennes. ``One of the most
difficult problems is from a radar blip, particularly from a
head-on target, to identify the type of aircraft,'' he said.
   ``It's not that surprising a mistake,'' said a congressional
source Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity. The darkened
radar screens show only lighted blips, not images of planes in
profile, said the source, who has witnessed demonstrations of the
Aegis system.
   The blips are smaller if the plane is coming head-on than they
would be if the plane were scanned sideways, the source said.
   A Pentagon source, who had also seen Aegis demonstrated, agreed.
``You have to know how to read the screens. It's not spelled out in
simple black and white, particularly if they didn't have the
transponder on.''
   The transponder, also known as an ``Identification Friend or
Foe'' device, or IFF, sends out continuous electronic signals
detailing the identity of a plane. They are standard on all
American commercial planes.
   Crowe has said U.S. officers concluded that they were dealing
with a military craft in past because of electronic transmissions
from it. CBS News reported Monday evening that the Iranian plane
was issuing two sets of signals _ one civilian and one typically
used by military craft.
   Crowe said the Vincennes was looking specifically for F-14s.
Iran only has four or five working F-14s, but they are the most
capable warplanes in the Iranian inventory and thus are considered
by the Navy to be the most threatening Iranian air weapon.
   The working F-14s were recently moved from northern Iranian
bases to Bandar Abbas, chiefly because Iran has suffered ground
defeats in its war with Iraq and ``they wanted to move the F-14s
down south where they wouldn't fall into Iraqi hands,'' said one
source. The Airbus took off from Bandar Abbas.
   Another factor, the sources said, is that the Vincennes was the
first Aegis-class cruiser to operate inside the gulf itself, rather
than from the neighboring Gulf of Oman or northern Indian Ocean.
The ship had only been in the gulf for little more than a week.
   ``They had to be extremely alert, perhaps more than they had
been when they were operating south, because they knew what an
expensive and high-value target the Aegis ship was,'' said one
source.
   In addition, the Vincennes' brief tenure in the gulf meant that
its crew wasn't used to the enormous amount of commercial traffic
that coexists there with the military.
   ``It's incredibly busy, with ships and planes, and it takes a
while to get used to it. The Vincennes may have been a little green
and that means they may have been a little fast on the draw,'' one
official said.

   Soviet and American peace walkers
journeyed westward across Iowa today after spending nearly a week
in the eastern part of the state and celebrating the Fourth of July
with a parade and cookout.
   Members of the American-Soviet Peace Walk carried Soviet,
American and Iowa flags in the two-mile parade Monday.
   ``This has been a great walk. American and Soviets do a great
deal of work for the cause of peace,'' said Valentina Belik, a Kiev
resident who joined about 220 other Soviets and 100 Americans on
the cross-country journey.
   Coralville Mayor Michael Kattchee, smiling broadly under a straw
hat, said the peace walk had a special significance for him.
   ``This is great. I was born in Lithuania, so for me it is a
great pleasure to see this happening,'' the 56-year-old mayor said.
``Maybe events like this will help open borders between the two
countries.
   ``I'm able to speak a little Russian, but I slip into German and
then I'm lost,'' Kattchee said.
   Lithuania was under Russian control from 1795 to 1918, under
Polish domination from 1920 to 1940, then was occupied by Soviet
troops and absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   The peace walkers have been in eastern Iowa _ the second leg of
their three-stage journey _ since last Wednesday and will continue
this week to Des Moines. From there, the group will be flown to Los
Angeles, where members will begin the last leg of their trek.

<HEAD>Controversial Developer Awaiting Trial In Bank-Loan Fraud Dies in
Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate developer awaiting trial in a
multimillion-dollar bank-loan fraud case apparently electrocuted
himself in jail, a sheriff's spokesman said.
   J.R. McConnell, 40, was discovered by a guard in a medical unit
at the Harris County Jail before 4 a.m. Monday, said sheriff's Lt.
G.L. Moore.
   ``It appears he had some type of electrical cord and inserted it
into one of the electric outlets that are of necessity in that
medical area and inserted the other end into another electrical
outlet and used himself to complete the circuit,'' Moore said.
   It was not known how McConnell obtained the cord, but inmates
usually purchase such items at the jail's commissary, Moore said.
   McConnell had been in the medical ward since he tried to hang
himself in his cell March 21. McConnell also had heart problems,
Moore added.
   Moore said that a note believed to be written by McConnell was
found on a table next to McConnell's bed.
   ``It's somewhat illegible and we're attempting to decipher what
it says. But it appears it might possibly be a suicide note,''
Moore said.
   Following his March suicide attempt, McConnell said he was
despondent over delays in his court proceedings. He was being held
on $750,000 bond pending trial July 19.
   McConnell surrendered to federal authorities last November when
he got off a plane from Mexico; he had been missing for more than a
year. He was indicted in October on charges that he and five
associates last year arranged loans for $4.2 million through fraud,
including false ownership papers for property posted as collateral.
   McConnell amassed hundreds of rental properties and development
projects in Houston and Galveston, court records show.
   In October 1986, he filed for bankruptcy. A court-appointed
trustee's report said McConnell and the 10 companies included in
the filing owed $427 million against $281 million in assets.
   Federal officials have said the two loans listed in the
indictment, one at a Houston bank and another at a savings and
loan, were only part of a larger scheme to defraud lending
institutions of at least $162 million.

   Stress and lack of training in handling
patient conflicts has led to a high rate of verbal and physical
abuse of state nursing home patients, a study released today says.
   ``It doesn't help us to blame the staff that work in these
difficult settings. Nurses and aides are victims of a difficult
situation as well,'' said University of New Hampshire political
scientist David Moore.
   Moore and and Karl Pillemer of UNH's Family Research Laboratory
conducted the anonymous survey in 1987 of 577 nurses and nurse's
aides from 32 private, not-for-profit and county nursing homes.
   Among the results:
   _ Nursing home patients had hit or thrown something at 70
percent of those surveyed during the previous year.
   _ Forty-one percent of the staff reported being pushed, grabbed,
pinched or shoved 10 times or more by patients, while only 13
percent said they never had been physically confronted by patients.
   _ Eighty-one percent of the staff said they had witnessed at
least one form of psychological patient abuse, including insults,
threats of violence or isolating a patient longer than needed.
   _ Thirty-six percent of the staff had seen at least one incident
in which physical force was used, including pushing, slapping and
pinching a patient.
   _ Ten percent admitted they used negative physical actions
against patients; 6 percent said they excessively restrained a
patient.
   Moore and Pillemer said the source of the problem is not
poor-quality staff but too few staff, high stress and lack of
training in how to deal with conflicts with patients.
   ``What we found is that staff members are basically
well-motivated and they are basically caring for people,'' Pillemer
said. But they ``work under what is considerable stress for
anybody.''
   Pillemer and Moore also found that nursing homes generally deal
with abuse problems quickly and effectively, either by disciplining
or firing the staff member.
   The researchers said improving training and boosting salaries
would help alleviate the problems.

   Episcopal churches would be forbidden to
discriminate against persons with AIDS under a resolution passed
today by one of two houses of the church's General Convention.
   The resolution ``prohibiting discrimination in the church on the
basis of AIDS, AIDS-related complex or HIV infection'' was approved
unanimously by the 900-member House of Deputies. The 200-member
House of Bishops was expected to consider the resolution later
today.
   The resolution was one of seven proposals concerning the disease
debated by convention committees. One would provide $120,000 over
three years for the work of the National Episcopal AIDS Coalition,
which carries the slogan, ``Our Church Has AIDS.'' Another would
require AIDS education in every Episcopal congregation by the end
of 1989.
   ``We have to talk about condoms, HIVs,'' said Thaddeus Bennett,
co-chair of the coalition. ``We have to be specific. Then we can
evangelize and tell them about Jesus. If we wait to talk to someone
on their deathbed, we have waited too long.''
   On Monday, delegates heard testimony on proposed resolutions
that would discourage abortion in most cases but support a woman's
right to abort.
   ``Many people have forgotten what it was like before legal
abortions,'' said Diane Pollard, a church deputy from New York.
   One resolution before the 69th General Convention discourages
abortion except in ``extreme cases,'' such as problem pregnancies
or in cases of rape. The other would discourage any legislative or
other governmental effort to remove women's right to consider
abortion.
   The legislative resolution ``basically restates the position of
the General Convention of 1976,'' said the Rev. Neil G. Lebhar of
Jacksonville, Fla.
   The resolutions were the result of a study ordered in the 1985
general convention.
   The committee adjourned for the day without acting on the
resolutions. If approved in committee, the resolutions would be
sent to the convention's 3,000 delegates for action. The General
Convention meets every three years to set policy for the 2.6
million-member church. The convention runs through July 11.
   Louisa Rucker, executive director of the National Organization
of Episcopalians for Life, opposed the resolution addressing
existing law on the right to abortion, saying it violated
principles of separation of church and state for the church to take
a stand.
   But she backed the resolution supporting women who decide on
abortion in some cases.
   ``It encourages and calls on the church to provide help and
support for women caught in untimely and unwanted pregnancies,''
Rucker said. ``We acknowledge a legal right for women to have an
abortion, but we call on Christians to a higher standard.''

   A Tulsa University student said he was
making holiday fireworks when material he was using exploded in an
art studio, blowing off part of his hand.
   Morris David Roth, 21, was hospitalized in fair condition after
the explosion Sunday blew off his left thumb and parts of his left
index and middle fingers, authorities said.
   ``I'm not out to hurt anyone,'' Roth said Monday. ``I'm
basically a loner pyrotechnics hobbyist. I don't have the money to
spend on fireworks so I make my own.''
   However, Fire Marshal Jim Pilkington said the 20 pounds of
explosives investigators recovered from the university art studio
were ``capable of considerable damage to structures and people.''
   Roth, who said he learned to make bombs from books, said he had
planned to explode several bombs in a field to celebrate the Fourth
of July.
   No charges had been filed by this morning.

   A single-engine plane slammed into a
house early today, critically injuring the pilot, but three people
in the house apparently escaped serious injury, the Pinellas County
Sheriff's Office reported.
   The plane crashed at about 6:20 a.m. northeast of the Clearwater

probably from fuel from the aircraft but it is under control,''
Logan said.
   Logan described injuries to the occupants of the house as minor.
   The pilot was taken to Bayfront Medical Center in St.
Petersburg, where he was listed in critical condition suffering
from burns, said Beth Marshall, director of the hospital's
emergency trauma services. The pilot's identity was not released by
the hospital.

   House Speaker Jim Wright today urged the
Reagan administration to apologize directly to Iran and pay
reparations for shooting down a passenger jet carrying 290 people
as an Iranian official said world condemnation of the United States
might ease talk of military retaliation.
   Wright, speaking less than 24 hours after President Reagan vowed
to keep U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf despite Iran's threats of
reprisals, predicted that Capitol Hill would authorize money for
reparations.
   `` ... If that would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved
party, surely we could do that,'' he said in London. ``Congress
would support that if it were requested.''
   The senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee,
John Warner of Virginia, also said the United States should pay
reparations.
   In Geneva, meanwhile, Sirous Nasseri, the Iranian ambassador to
the U.N. mission there, said, ``So far as the avenge is concerned,
at this stage we really hope there will be public opinion, we will
let the public opinion and the political activities to run its
course.''
   ``And we hope that the matter can ease itself down through a
proper approach to the matter, that is, the condemnation of the act
by the United States,'' Nasseri said in an interview on the NBC-TV
``Today'' show.
   Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said
Monday that ``We must all be prepared for a real war and go to the
war fronts and fight against America and its lackeys.''
   And today in Tehran, Iranian President Ali Khamenei said that
the Islamic Republic has the ``right to avenge'' those who died
when Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down Sunday by missiles fired
from the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes, whose crew thought it was
shooting at an F-14 fighter about to attack the ship.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that Khamenei told
world leaders in messages that the disaster ``has roused a wave of
rage'' in Iran ``and aversion to the U.S. government.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today he could not
say whether the United States had apologized directly to Iran
through private communications or other means.
   Wright, interviewed by the British Broadcasting Corp., noted
that Reagan had expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives but
``is not given to profuse apologies in any event.'' Asked if he
ought to be, the Texas Democrat replied, ``Yes, he should be.''
   ``We close ranks, so please don't ask me to try to correct the
language of the president,'' he said. ``I'm just stating as a
matter of fact that Mr. Reagan is not given to acknowledging error.
It's a personal trait, he's gone as far as I've ever heard him go
and he has expressed his deep regret as president of the United
States.''
   Warner said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' today that ``we
have compassion for the families'' of the victims and that he hopes
``this nation acts swiftly to try and compensate the families.
   But he said he feels the captain of the Vincennes ``made the
right decision under the circumstances.''
   Warner said that before Sunday's incident, the Vincennes had
``intelligence that Khomeini said that (Iran) may take an F-14 and
have a kamikaze attack and crash it into an American ship.''
   Reagan on Sunday sidestepped questions about compensation for
the relatives of those who perished.
   Fitzwater said ``there's really nothing that we can do (at this
time). The investigation (of the accident) is being conducted by
the Navy.''
   Reagan also repeated that he regretted the incident, which U.S.
officials said happened when the captain of the USS Vincennes
mistook the Iranian A-300 civilian jet for a fighter.
   But Reagan said he will not withdraw U.S. forces from the area.
``We want peace in the gulf, but we also want the right of
navigation of international waters,'' he said.
   ``We're talking about an incident in which a plane on radar was
observed coming in the direction of a ship in combat and the plane
began lowering its altitude,'' he said. ``So I think it was an
understandable accident to shoot and think that they were under
attack from that plane.''
   Iran accused the United States of knowingly shooting down the
unarmed plane and requested an investigation by the Montreal-based
International Civil Aviation Organization.
   Asked what he thought about that, Reagan replied, ``You have to
think about that, knowing who they are.''
   But when asked about the Iranian accusation that the Navy knew
it was firing on a passenger jet, the president replied: ``Well, I
don't go much by what the Iranians say _ ever.''
   There were these other related developments:
   _In Beirut, the spiritual guide for Iranian-backed guerrillas
holding foreign captives in Lebanon was quoted as saying today that
the hostages should not suffer because the U.S. Navy shot down an
Iranian jetliner.
   But an anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad,
which holds Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland,
threatened to kill one of them in revenge. It was not possible to
authenticate the call. Islamic Jihad has said it would authenticate
its statements with photographs of the hostages.
   A State Department official, requesting anonymity, said of the
call:
   ``There is no confirmation ...that this is a legitimate thing.''
   _An Italian naval spokesman said today that an Italian frigate
in the gulf heard the Vincennes radioing an approaching aircraft,
requesting identification and change of course. However, the
spokesman, Capt. Alfredo Saitto, said the Italian ship could not
determine whether the Iranian airliner was flying outside the
commercial air corridor, as Italian officials had said Monday.
   _The Washington Post today quoted Pentagon sources whom it did
not identify as saying that a report filed Monday by another U.S.
Navy ship, the frigate Sides, said the Iranian plane was climbing
when it was shot down, as Iran has claimed. The Post said officials
did not know whether the report from the Sides, or other from the
Vincennes saying the Iranian plane was descending toward that ship,
was the accurate version of Sunday's events.
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition they not be further
identified, said Monday that the commander of the Vincennes, Capt.
Will C. Rogers III, had sent a message to his superiors stressing
that he had followed procedures and would make the same decisions
again if faced with the same situation.
   Rogers said in the message, parts of which were made available
today by sources, that ``this is a burden I will carry for the rest
of my life ... but I took this action to defend my ship and crew.''
He added that ``I, and I alone, am responsible.''
   He said that he ``believed the incoming aircraft ... (was)
operating in direct response to the ongoing surface engagement,''
and that he ``had requested permission to engage at 20 nautical
miles'' but ``held until nine,'' when he fired two SM-2 Standard
missiles at the aircraft.

<HEAD>Three Busloads Of Poles Go Direct To Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three buses carrying 181 Poles drove
straight from the Poland-Austria border to the main refugee camp
south of Vienna, where the passengers asked for political asylum,
the Interior Ministry reported today.
   The Poles, most of whom are likely to be turned down as
political refugees, arrived Monday at the crowded camp, officials
said. It was the latest group of East bloc defectors since Austria
loosened visa restrictions with Poland and Hungary this year.
   ``Six to eight buses stopped at Traiskirchen's main square,''
said Karl Nevole, spokesman for Interior Minister Karl Blecha.
``All passengers of three buses got out and walked to the refugee
camp to ask for political asylum.''
   The other buses left for Italy, but Newole said it was not clear
if they were all pilgrims or would try to defect in Italy or
elsewhere in Austria.
   According to the Interior Ministry, there are 20,000 recognized
political refugees in Austria. In addition, there are 15,000 asylum
seekers, which are also supported by the government.
   Newole told The Associated Press that while in the January-May
period last year 126 Poles asked for political asylum in Austria,
the corresponding number of the same period this year was 2,271.
   ``The visa free status must not become a one-way street in the
direction of refugee camps,'' Interior Minister Karl Blecha was
quoted as saying in criticizing Monday's arrival of Polish refugees.
   He said 90 percent of all Polish asylum seekers are people
seeking to resettle in the United States or other overseas
countries.
   The government on May 9 introduced a quicker review of their
status.
   Most of the Poles and Hungarians generally are believed not to
qualify as refugees because they are unable to prove political
persecution or other personal hardship in their homelands.
   Newole said no Poles or Hungarians have been deported, but some
have been persuaded to return home because they stand no chance to
emigrate soon to the United States, Canada or Australia.

   Investigators say heavy foliage around a
duplex delayed response to a fire that killed five family members.
   The fire early Monday morning killed Jack Blose, 35; his wife,
Deborah, 31; their 12-year-old son, Jack Jr.; and 5-year-old
daughter, Rachel, officials said. Four-year-old daughter Lacey
Blose died Mondy night at Children's Hospital Medical Center of
Akron, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   All five died of smoke inhalation, the Stark County Coroner's
office said today.
   ``Heavy foliage that screened the house kept (the fire) from
being detected until it was well under way,'' said Dick Anthony,
clerk for the Canton fire chief.
   When firefighters arrived, the entire front porch was engulfed,
and flames were shooting up to the second and third floors, Anthony
said.
   The cause had not been determined, Anthony said.

   A 28-year-old man allegedly killed two of his
sons and his mother-in-law and critically wounded a third son
before trying to kill himself by jumping in the Detroit River,
police said.
   The suspect, an unemployed man whose identity was withheld, was
rescued Monday from the river, said Officer Fred Zaharoff, a police
spokesman.
   Before he jumped, the suspect told Homer Ford, a security guard
at the Central Marine Terminal, that he wanted to make his
estranged wife suffer, according to Ford.
   Police found the bodies at a home, Zaharoff said. They were
identified as Jason Kent, 5, Sparticus Kent, 7, and Essa Mae Kent,
64, police Lt. Philip Foster said. Owen Kent, 4, was in critical
condition at Children's Hospital with a head wound, officials said.
   The suspect was in custody on suspicion of murder, Zaharoff
said. No arraignment had been scheduled.
   In West Memphis, Ark., meanwhile, authorities said Monday that
two children whose burned bodies were found near a dump were killed
by their mother and another woman.
   Barbara McCoy, 40, the mother, and Mary Delois Williams, 32,
were in jail without bond Monday pending a hearing Wednesday,
Crittenden County Sheriff's investigator Charles Walker said.
   The women were arrested Monday at a motel in West Memphis, where
they had apparently been staying, investigators said. Both were
charged with first-degree murder.
   The bodies of Bianca Tirado, 7, and Maximillion E. McCoy, 2,
were found in plastic bags off a gravel road leading to a dump. The
children were slain elsewhere and dumped and set afire,
investigator R.D. Clay said.

   Americans from Hawaii to New York marked the Fourth of July with
fireworks, parades, food and fun including pitchfork fondue in
Montana and marchers dressed as rodents in Columbus, Ohio.
   For Americans overseas, the celebration was somewhat subdued
because of the downing Sunday of an Iranian jetliner by a U.S.
missile. At Heathrow Airport in London, U.S. flags put up for the
Fourth of July were taken down as a mark of respect for the 290
dead.
   In Los Angeles, a protest against the U.S. downing of the
civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf turned violent when 10
demonstrators from the mostly Iranian crowd attacked an
anti-Khomeini television commentator.
   Police in New York cancelled a fireworks show planned by reputed
underworld boss John Gotti. In Malibu, Calif., seven people were
arrested at a raucous party at the home of Donald Sterling, owner
of the Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball team. Two
16-year-old boys arrested in Malibu allegedly fired bottle rockets
at sheriff's deputies.
   About 500 people helped celebrate the 30th birthday of Willie
B., the senior ape at Zoo Atlanta. The people shared a gigantic
banana split while the guest of honor got a basket of fruit.
   The joy of America's 212th birthday was muted by accidents and
the drought, which snuffed fireworks in many communties because of
fire fears.
   An overloaded boat capsized in New Bedford Harbor in
Massachusetts, leaving three dead and a child missing. At least 29
people suffered injuries in fireworks-related incidents.
   In Boston, Gov. Michael Dukakis, the certain Democratic
presidential nominee, and his wife Kitty joined Jesse Jackson and
his wife Jacqueline beside the Charles River for the traditional
Boston Pops concert and fireworks. The couples shared dinner
earlier at the Dukakis home in Brookline.
   Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee-apparent,
made a number of campaign appearances, including a reception for
nearly 200 people sworn in as U.S. citizens at the VP Fair in St.
Louis.
   In Aransas Pass, Texas, about 500 shrimping vessels took part in
the 40th annual Blessing of the Fleet.
   At the Angelina National Forest in Texas, more than 2,500
members of the Rainbow Family, many wearing only a layer of mud,
held a prayer vigil for peace and harmony in the culmination of the
17th annual ``gathering of the tribes.''
   Peace also was a theme of a parade in Coralville, Iowa, where
Soviets taking part in the America-Soviet Peace Walk marched two
miles to the applause of hundreds of residents.
   ``This is great,'' said Mayor Michael Kattchee. ``I was born in
Lithuania, so for me it is a great pleasure to see this happening.''
   About 220 Soviets and 100 Americans are on the cross-country
journey that began in Washington June 17.
   In Willimantic, Conn., about 500 people marched down Main Street
carrying their own music in the form of portable radios to the
delight of 1,000 spectators. The radios, tuned to a local station,
played 25 marches and a finale featuring Kate Smith's rendition of
``God Bless America.''
   In Columbus, Ohio, residents dressed as rodents wearing gas
masks staged a Doo-Dah parade to mock odors from trash and
sewage-treatment operations and factories on the city's south side.
   ``We dwell with the smell,'' said marcher Bob Lipetz. ``A little
chaos is good for society every now and then.''
   After a parade in Choteau, Mont., about 1,000 people repaired to
the town park for pitchfork fondue: sirloin steaks impaled on the
end of a pitchfork and plunged into a huge vat of rendered beef fat.
   There were fireworks aplenty.
   In Hawaii, there were six displays throughout the islands, most
at military bases. At Pearl Harbor, the battleship USS Missouri
fired a 21-gun salute from a signal cannon.
   In Chicago, a crowd estimated at 1.2 million filled Grant Park
to watch a pyrotechnic extravaganza over Lake Michigan.
   New York City's spectacular, billed as the nation's largest on
the Fourth, included a 60-foot electric Statue of Liberty and
fireboats spouting water 300 feet into the air.
   But the fun was marred by accidents.
   A 1-year-old child, her mother and another woman drowned when an
overloaded 22-foot boat capsized in New Bedford Harbor while
returning from a fireworks display, throwing 15 occupants into the
water, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard searched today for a missing 5-year-old boy,
said Petty Officer David Foley.
   In New York City's Chinatown, an incendiary device destroyed a
Police Department van used to confiscate fireworks, causing minor
injuries to 11 passers-by, said Sgt. Maurice Howard. The blast
``may have been in retaliation for the fireworks that were
confiscated,'' Howard said.
   In Jacksonville, Ill., a mortar misfired, causing minor injuries
to nine people in a parking lot, said police Cadet Kim Heisler.
   In Duluth, Minn., a fireworks explosion started several small
fires at Bayfront Park on Lake Superior, forced the evacuation of
tens of thousands of specatators and slightly burned three people,
police said.
   Nashville, Tenn., officials attributed three fires to fireworks.
   Children playing with fireworks in Kettering, Ohio, started a
blaze that heavily damaged two units of a six-unit apartment
building, officials said. Six to seven firefighters were treated
for heat exhaustion or injuries suffered in minor falls, said Fire
Chief Jim Frey.
   A large wildfire 10 miles west of Yosemite National Park and
five miles west of the town of El Portal that consumed 2,200 acres
may have been caused by illegal fireworks, said Dick Wisehart of
the U.S. Forest Service.
   Police in Denver sought three suspects in the shooting death of
a man who apparently had been throwing firecrackers at passing
cars. Police said the suspects were in a car that stopped after a
frecracker was thrown at it.
   Thomas Peterson, 22, a student at the University of Denver, fell
two stories to his death from a roof where he and friends
apparently were setting off fireworks, Denver police said. Petersen
apaprently was trying to avoid being hit by fireworks, police said.

   A truck driver ran through a tollgate
and tried to ram several patrol cars during a 65-mile chase on
Interstate 70 before a trooper shot him in the head, authorities
said.
   David W. Cole, 28, of Providence, Ky., was in critical condition
today. No one else was injured, said Trooper Janet Trammell.
   Officials in Kansas, where the chase began, said Cole had been
clocked speeding in his empty tractor-trailer.
   ``The truck weaved from shoulder to shoulder and on several
occasions tried to strike the patrol cars,'' said Trammell.
   Cole drove through a roadblock at about 60 mph, Trammell said.
Police then fired at the truck and hit a left rear tire. Cole still
refused to stop, she said. A few miles away, a trooper shot Cole in
the head, Trammell said.
   Cole's brother, a passenger, pulled the vehicle off the road and
stopped.

   Teams of Soviet inspectors who are returning to Moscow today say
they were satifisfied with their weekend visits to U.S. military
installations in four states.
   The Soviets conducted ``baseline inspections'' in California,
Arizona, Utah and Colorado for the On-Site Inspections Agency under
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. U.S. teams were in
the Soviet Union at the same time.
   ``Together with representatives of the OSIA and with cooperation
of representatives of the plant, the first unprecedented action was
fulfilled in verification of the compliance with the obligation
under the treaty between the U.S.S.R and the U.S.,'' said
Vyacheslav Kharlamov, who led a group which visited General
Dynamics Plant 19 in San Diego.
   ``Basically, there's nothing for them to see,'' said Lt. Col.
J.B. Kump, explaining that the plant no longer makes the missile
launchers. ``But they are verifying what we said in the treaty
about this place is true.''
   In Arizona, the Soviets inspected facilities at Davis-Monthan
Air Force Base in Tucson and the Fort Huachuca Army base in Sierra
Vista.
   Davis-Monthan is the home of Air Force's 868th Tactical Missile
Training Group, which trains cruise missile crews for deployment
for Europe. The unit does some training at a Fort Huachuca range.
   ``They were very thorough. They knew what they were doing. It
wasn't just a walk-through. They were very technical,'' said Lt.
Perry L. Nouis, an escort with the OSIA.
   ``At this point, they're happy and we're happy,'' Air Force Gen.
Larry B. Keith, commander of the 836th Air Division at
Davis-Monthan, said.
   Keith also said the Soviets ``were very cordial in their
departure. They presented our escort officers with small medallions
and we in turn gave them squadron and group patches of the 868th
Missile Group as mementos for having been here.''
   In Colorado, Soviet inspectors visited the Pueblo Army Depot to
inventory Pershing missiles which are to be destroyed under the
treaty.
   Another team visited the Hercules Aerospace Co. plant at Magna,
Utah, near Salt Lake City, to verify that Pershing 2 engines were
no longer in production.
   Soviet inspectors will be permanently based in Magna, but not at
the other sites.

   Barge operators struggled to keep traffic flowing steadily on
the drought-lowered Mississippi River as two states wrangled over a
proposal to divert water there from the Great Lakes.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad today said he may declare a statewide
drought emergency unless widespread rain falls this week. That
could make some farmers eligible for low-interest disaster loans
and would increase the governor's clout when he goes to Washington
later this week to lobby for more drought aid.
   ``We don't want to see a lot of farm families forced back into
bankruptcy,'' Branstad said.
   Federal officials have insisted it is too early to assess the
damage from the drought. But Branstad said it is clear some farmers
and crops have been hurt.
   Independence Day traffic on the Mississippi was steady, with two
groundings reported in the Memphis, Tenn., area, Coast Guard
spokesman Dave Schuster said Monday.
   ``They're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars each day, I
guess they figure they've got to go no matter what,'' he said of
towboat operators who can move fewer barges because of shallow
spots caused by the drought.
   Dredging closed the river near Greenville, Miss., and north of
Memphis, Schuster said.
   In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson has threatened to ask the
U.S. Supreme Court to halt proposals for increased diversion of
Lake Michigan water to replenish the shrinking Mississippi.
   An aide said the governor fears temporary diversion through
Chicago and down the Illinois River in response to the current
drought might become a permanent practice. He said the move is also
a feint to get more water to disperse river waste in the Chicago
area.
   Thompson had received reports the Army Corps of Engineers might
quadruple the diversion at Chicago in the next few days to fight
the low-water conditions troubling Mississippi River barge tows,
said James Klauser, secretary of the Department of Administration.
   ``The navigation of (sewage) down the Chicago River is the only
navigation issue here,'' he said. ``It's solely a matter of
flushing Chicago.''
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson originated the appeal to federal
authorities to divert more Lake Michigan water to the Mississippi
watershed.
   In Louisiana, environmental officials said they would monitor
the Mississippi more closely for salt and toxic substances as the
drought continues to decrease the freshwater flow.
   ``We're concerned about the toxics going down the river and are
seriously taking a look at it now,'' said Maureen O'Neill of the
Department of Environmental Quality said in Baton Rouge. ``We're
not seeing the same dilution factor'' normally present.
   Levels of toxic substances still are low, but the environmental
agency will increase monthly sampling to weekly, O'Neill said.
   Communities that get their drinking water from the lower part of
the Mississippi are seeing chloride concentrations rise as salt
water moves rapidly up the river, she said.
   In St. Louis, the low level of the Mississippi helped the Delta
Queen recapture the glory it had lost in recent years by churning
to victory in an annual riverboat race.
   The Mississippi Queen trailed the Delta Queen in the half-mile
race to the Gateway Arch.
   ``The record (river) low worked to our advantage, because the
Mississippi Queen is heavier,'' Delta Queen captain Garland
Shewmaker said.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with legislation on women
priests adopted. Picks up 4th grav pvs, ` The archbishop said...'

<TEXT>
   Church of England leaders today voted in favor of
draft legislation to admit women to the priesthood, despite
opposition from their spiritual head, Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie.
   The vote at the annual General Synod of bishops, clergy and
laity was 299 to 216.
   Earlier, Runcie drew loud applause from the 574 participants
when he warned that the legislation would divide the church, and
many observers believed the proposal would be defeated.
   The synod today opened its three-day summer session at Church
House, Westminster.
   During the debate, Runcie said that although he favored the
principle of women priests, he believed the terms of the proposal
would cause ``a kind of legislative schism.''
   The archbishop said he believed theological arguments ``now tip
the balance in favor'' of women priests, but added that the wording
of the draft legislation ``would not serve the cause of women's
ordination or the spiritual health of the church.'' He was
referring to proposed rules which would allow parishes and dioceses
to refuse to be ministered to by women priests.
   The archbishop is the spiritual head of the Anglican state
church and leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, including 3
million U.S. Episcopalians.
   Runcie said earlier that the priesthood actually may be weakened
by being solely male.
   ``I have come to the judgment that the ordination of women to
the priesthood would actually be an enlargement of the Catholic
(universal) priesthood, an opening up of priesthood, rather than
its overturning,'' he said.
   The English church still bars women priests, although Anglican
churches in other countries have ordained about 1,000 women,
according to England's Movement for the Ordination of Women.
Churches ordaining women include the U.S. Episcopalians and
Anglicans in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Brazil, Kenya and
Uganda.
   Opponents say there is nothing in the Bible to support women
priests, that Jesus Christ had only male apostles and for nearly
2,000 years the church ordained only men.
   Speakers in favor of women priests at today's debate outnumbered
opponents by four to one. A majority of the 53 diocesan and deputy
bishops are in favor of women priests but some, including sections
of the clergy and laity, are opposed.
   Law lecturer David McClean, in moving the proposals, said: ``The
idea of women priests is not going to go away _ there is nothing in
the experience of the Anglican Communion to support any such
notion.''
   McCLean, of Sheffield University, is chairman of the synod's
House of Laity and opened the debate in the crowded assembly hall.
   New proposals include giving a bishop who opposes women priests
the right to bar them in his diocese and to pay up to $51,000
compensation to priests who leave the church over the issue on
grounds of conscience.
   The draft legislation will be referred to revision committees
and then to all 44 diocesan synods. It will return to the General
Synod for another vote and must then be approved by Parliament.
   Parliament, which by law established the Anglican church and
made the British monarch its temporal head, has the final say on
such legislation and on all other matters of church doctrine.
   If all stages are passed without delay, the Church of England's
first woman priest may be ordained in 1992 or 1993.

   Police have detained three West German
television journalists after a tribal chief objected to their
photographing a traditional funeral, a colleague said Tuesday.
   No charges have been filed against the West Germans, who are
being held under house arrest at the New Imperial Hotel in the
western town of Kisumu, according to a spokesman for the ARD-German
TV crew.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, identified the three as
Helmut Grosse, 49, from Hamburg; cameraman Thomas Mittelstenscheld,
39, of West Berlin; and Bernd Longree, 48, from Bonn, a TV
journalist who accompanied the others in a private capacity.
   The crew had driven to a village near Kisumu, 140 miles
northwest of Nairobi, to photograph a traditional Luo tribal burial
Sunday at the invitation of relatives, the journalist said.
   A local chief objected to their shooting and they stopped, he
said.
   Before their planned return to Nairobi, however, police
questioned them, seized their car, identity papers and equipment,
and ordered them to stay at the hotel, where they were lodged.
   ``We've had no official explanation as to why they are being
detained,'' their colleague said. ``We only know they've been told
not to leave the hotel.'' West German diplomats in Nairobi are
investigating, he added.

   The highest-ranking associate of Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis to face criminal indictment pleaded innocent today to state
charges of theft, forgery, tax evasion and conflict of interest.
   Gerard T. Indelicato, who faces sentencing on federal corruption
charges later this week, was released without bail by Magistrate
William Walsh in Suffolk Superior Court.
   Defense attorney Steve Brooks said Indelicato would also plead
innocent to another set of state charges Wednesday in Plymouth
County. Brooks had no further comment.
   The former education adviser to Dukakis pleaded guilty to
separate federal charges of fraud and conspiracy before state
Attorney General James Shannon filed new accusations.
   The state indictments cover both Indelicato's term as Dukakis'
special assistant for educational affairs from 1983 to 1986 and his
term as president of Bridgewater State College, a position he held
from 1986 until his resignation last December.
   The indictments outline a pattern of alleged criminal acts by
Indelicato, 42, and associates to divert an undisclosed amount of
public funds for private gain.

   Rebels of Uganda's Holy Spirit Movement
have released seven kidnapped priests and nuns after the Roman
Catholic Church met their demands for medical supplies, a church
official said Tuesday.
   The Rev. Agostoni Tarcis, secretary of the church's Justice and
Peace Commission, said the abductions occurred Saturday at Amuru
Mission, 19 miles from the northern provincial capital, Gulu, after
an abortive rebel raid on nearby Lacor mission hospital for drugs.
   ``The rebels held the hostages, demanding drugs in exchange for
their release,'' Tarcis said.
   They freed their victims, all Ugandans, the next day after the
church handed over an unspecified amount of medication.
   In March, rebels belonging to the same group attacked Lacor
hospital and got away with large quantities of drugs. Since then,
government troops have guarded the medical center.
   The government of President Yoweri Museveni, who seized power in
January 1986, is fighting several different rebel groups in
northern and eastern Uganda.

<TEXT>
   The most recent issue of a liberal
Serbian literary magazine was bannned temporarily Tuesday for
publishing an article criticizing late President Josip Broz Tito.
   A prosecutor imposed the ban on the bimonthly Knjizevne Novine
pending a court decision, the state-run Tanjug news agency said.
   The prosecutor ruled that the article ``Criminals and Victims''
by Dragoslav Mihajlovic ``could imperil public peace.''
   The article dealt with Tito's role in the Communist regime's
repressive measures against dissidents incarcerated in the Goli
Otok prison camp in the late 1940s.
   Goli Otok, an isolated rocky island off the central Adriatic
coast, was used as an internment camp for 13,000 alleged opponents
of the regime after Tito's break with the Soviet bloc in 1948.
   Several thousand are said to have died in detention from ill
treatment by the prison authorities.
   Tito was the undisputed leader of Yugoslavia for 35 years until
his death in 1980. He is still officially revered by Yugoslav
authorities, and any public criticism of his policies is considered
a criminal offense.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis invited two prospective
running mates to his Statehouse office today and planned to meet
Wednesday with another candidate for the No. 2 spot, a source said.
   Sen. Albert Gore of Tennesee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, both former presidential candidates who have endorsed
Dukakis since dropping out of the race, were to visit the
Massachusetts governor first. Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana was to
meet with Dukakis on Wednesday, said the source, who spoke only on
the condition of anonymity.
   Dukakis recently has met with four other prospective running
mates _ Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Bob
Graham of Florida as well as Jesse Jackson, who had dinner with
Dukakis on Monday night. Dukakis also met last week with Georgia
Sen. Sam Nunn, who later said he wasn't interested being offered
the post.
   Before leaving Boston today, Jackson renewed his contention that
he would be the best choice.
   While Dukakis met with prospective running mates in Boston, the
man helping him with the search, campaign chairman Paul Brountas,
was in Washington for four days of meetings to seek advice on the
selection, the source said.
   Gore, Gephardt, Hamilton, Glenn, Bentsen, Graham and Jackson all
have been asked by the Dukakis campaign for detailed background and
financial information, according to sources.
   Jackson declared at a news conference today that he ``would be
an asset'' to the Democratic ticket and was more qualified than
others being considered for the No. 2 spot. He declined to say
whether he pushed for the offer during his Monday night discussions
with probable presidential nominee Dukakis nor whether he would
accept such an offer.
   He did say, however, ``I am convinced that my presence would
unleash more hope in this country, regain more people. The fact of
the matter is, I would be an asset.''
   Jackson left for New York after the news conference but left
behind aides for negotiations with the Dukakis campaign over
convention issues.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, was spending the day at the
Statehouse tending to state business in addition to the meetings
with Gore and Gephardt. At the top of his state agenda was
balancing the budget for the fiscal year that ended Thursday and at
the same time balancing the budget for the year that began Friday.
   He has said Jackson is receiving ``very serious consideration''
as his running mate, but has also said Jackson's position as
runner-up in the Democratic primaries entitles him to nothing more
than that.
   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond
their districts or beyond their home states,'' Jackson said today.
``I bring the sense of creativity, new history.''
   Jackson said he had a ``thoroughly enjoyable evening'' with
Dukakis and said their relationship ``has grown immensely.''
   He said he discussed the vice presidential nomination with
Dukakis and added that he came away from the meeting with the
impression that the governor had not yet made up his mind on a
running mate. He said they did not discuss other potential
candidates for the second spot on the ticket.
   Jackson said two weeks ago that he had decided whether he wanted
to be the party's candidate for vice president but has refused to
make his decision public.
   Dukakis, who was Jackson's host for the Independence Day meeting
and celebration, refused to be specific about their discussions.
   ``We were talking about lots of things,'' was all Dukakis had to
say Monday evening as he and Jackson emerged from Dukakis'
Brookline home and headed to the banks of the Charles River for the
traditional Boston Pops concert and fireworks.
   About the only thing Jackson was willing to discuss at that time
was the menu of clam chowder, poached salmon and peas and chocolate
torte. ``Balanced meal; well cooked,'' he said.
   Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, greeted Jackson and his wife,
Jacqueline, outside the governor's home, where a crowd of nearly
200 people was waiting.
   Arriving to rousing applause, Jackson led Mrs. Dukakis over to
the crowd and Dukakis followed with Mrs. Jackson. There were cheers
again when the couples emerged from the house 90 minutes later and
climbed into a van for the ride to the concert, where they sat in
the front row among an estimated 250,000 concert-goers.

   Michael Dukakis set face-to-face meetings toda
with three vice presidential prospects, including two former
rivals. George Bush was in Washington after saying on a campaign
trip he could ``identify with the dilemma faced by the captain'y and Wednesday'
of
the ship that shot down an Iranian airliner.
   Dukakis talked politics with Jesse Jackson over dinner Monday
night, but neither of them would say afterward whether anything was
settled concerning Jackson's claims on the No. 2 position. Jackson
renewed those claims in comments to reporters today.
   Sen. Albert Gore of Tennesee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, both former presidential candidates who have endorsed
Dukakis since dropping out of the race, werfended during a Midwestern campaign
swing on Monday's July
Fourth holiday.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who is the all-but-certain
Democratic nominee, was at the Statehouse today after playing host
to Jackson and his wife for dinner and the Boston fireworks display
Monday night.
   Jackson said today at a news conference in Boston, ``I am
convinced that my presence would unleash more hope in this country,
regain more people. The fact of the matter is, I would be an
asset.''
   He left for New York afations with the Dukakis campaign
over convention issues.
   Today, Jackson still wouldn't say whether he would accept the
vice presidential nomination, but he went to great lengths to
distinguish himself from others being considered.
   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond
their districts or beyond their home states,'' Jackson said. ``I
bring the sense of creativity, new history.''
   On Monday, both Bush and Dukakis said they were saddened by the
shooting down of an Iran Air Airbus over the Persian Gulf. All 290
aboard were killed, Iran said.
   Bush, who waited a day before speaking out on the incident, said
Monday at a stop in Elmwood Park, Ill., that he could ``identify
with the dilemma faced by the captain of the USS Vincennes.''
   The vessel's captain, Will Rogers III, told the Pentagon he
believed his ship was under attack by an Iranian warplane.
   The vice president, who was a World War II pilot, was asked how
the Navy cruiser's sophisticated radar equipment could have failed
to distinguish between the wide-bodied airliner and a small F-14
fighter, which was believed to be the target.
   ``Ever been in combat?'' Bush snapped. ``Combat is quite
ifferent than the laboratory.''
   He said he did not expect U.S. policy in the gulf to change as a
result of the incident. ``Life goes on,'' the vice president said.
   Bush made campaign stops outside Detroit and Chicago, and in St.
Louis before heading home to Washington Monday night. He had spent
the weekend at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The vice president was in Kennebunkport when word of the gulf
incident was relayed to Washington Sunday. He spoke with President
Reagan in a conference call that afternoon, spokeswoman Sheila Tate
said, and was meeting with the president today at the White House.
   Dukakis, in a Fourth of July speech at the Navy's oldest
commissioned warship _ the USS Constitution, berthed near Boston _
called for an end to the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``I believe that the United States must take the lead ... to
stop this war permanently,'' he said. Dukakis also warned Iran that
``this is no time for acts of terror or revenge in response to the
incident.''
   Jackson reacted to the incident by criticizing Reagan
administration policy in the Persian Gulf, calling it ``failed and
vague.'' He urged the president to promptly offer reparations to
the families of the victims.
   Reagan said Monday he would await the results of a Pentagon
investigation of the incident.
   Jackson also said there was ``no evidence'' that the Vincennes
was under attack at the time of the incident, and compared the
shooting down of the Iranian airliner to the Soviet downing of a
Korean Air Lines jetliner in 1983.
   Both Reagan and the Pentagon have said such comparisons are
unfair, because Sunday's incident occurred in a war zone, and
because the Navy repeatedly radioed warnings to the approaching
Iranian plane. Neither was the case in the KAL incident.
   ``When the KAL was shot down, we did not accept those arguments
as being valid, and most people in the world will not accept our
arguments to this point as being valid,'' Jackson said.

   Jane Fonda, who already has apologized
on national television for her 1972 trip to Hanoi, will appear with
Robert DeNiro at a benefit for children with birth defects linked
to the defoliant Agent Orange.
   Fonda and DeNiro star in the upcoming ``Union Street,'' which
will be partly filmed in Waterbury.
   The July 29 benefit will aid the Brandy Schieb Children's Fund,
a project of the Stamford-based Vietnam Veterans Victims of Agent
Orange Inc., said the Rev. John A. McColley, rector of St.
Michael's Episcopal Church in Naugatuck and a Vietnam veteran.
   The benefit ``grew out of the spirit of reconcilation and good''
inspired during a meeting in June between Fonda and a group of
veterans at St. Michael's on June 18, McColley said.
   ``Afterward, a lot of us were standing around saying wouldn't it
be great if now we could all do somthing together,'' he said.
   Fund-raising activities at the benefit may include a booth where
people can get their pictures taken with Fonda and DeNiro, said
Stephen Rivers, a Fonda spokesman.

   Topol, star of film and stage versions of
``Fiddler On the Roof,'' said Tuesday he is stepping in to try to
revive enthusiasm for the musical ``Ziegfeld.''
   Topol, who does not use his surname, said he was first
approached 10 months ago to play the title role of Broadway
entrepreneur Florenz Ziegfeld.
   ``Then they (the management) kind of disappeared ... I didn't
know what was going on behind the scenes,'' said Topol, who is
contracted for at least three months from July 25.
   Director Joe Layton and the original star, Len Cariou, left the
production soon after the opening on April 26 to nearly unanimous
pans. Since then, actor-director Tommy Steele has been revising and
cutting the show, with understudy Marc Urquhart playing Ziegfeld.
   ``I hope I can create an entertaining show and that I can
contribute,'' Topol, 52, said. ``But we will wait and see if
congratulations are in order.''
   He will receive $37,400 a week pay, believed to be a near-record
for London's West End theater district.

   Aron Kay used to toss pies to make a
political point, but these days he's organizing protesters to pack
the party conventions.
   Kay says he's thrown pies at Phyllis Schafly, Gordon Liddy and
William F. Buckley.
   ``You remember the guy who years ago used to throw pies into
politicians' faces,'' Kay, 38, said over the weekend. ``That was
me.''
   Each pie, Kay said, was a statement about its ``victim.''
   Sen. Patrick Moynihan was hit with a mocha cream pie for
allegedly making a racist comment; Schlafly and Liddy got apple
pies because of their ``pro-American'' ideas; mushroom-tofu pie was
used on Edward Teller, H-bomb inventor, Kay said.
   ``The mushrooms symbolized mushroom clouds, and the tofu
symbolized life,'' he said.
   But Kay, 38, says his pie-throwing days are over. His latest
project is to mobilize caravans of protesters to go to the
Democratic and Republican national conventions this summer in
Atlanta and New Orleans.
   Kay is advocating the legalization of ``safe drugs'' such as
marijuana and protesting U.S. intervention in Central America.

   At the Joe Namath football camp, youngsters
get more than a cameo appearance from the former New York Jets
quarterback.
   When he started the camp 17 years ago with former teammate John
Dockery, ``that's one of the basic rules John and I agreed upon _
the two of us being here,'' Namath said.
   The majority of this year's campers, ages 8 to 18, never saw
Namath play. But their parents did, and that is one reason why
enrollment at the camp remains strong. Each of the two one-week
sessions draws 300 to 350 kids.
   ``He is like a Joe DiMaggio. People will never forget him. He'll
be locked in time,'' said Dockery.
   Namath, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, continues to
do commercials and is a football analyst for NBC-TV.
   Besides teaching football, the camp stresses character, Namath
said.
   ``Football is not the top priority here. It's an important
priority but the overall picture is life in general. John and I
have talked about this, and I've learned this through football, you
don't do much on your own.''

<TEXT>
   At least two other mix-ups with civilian
planes by U.S. warships occurred in the Persian Gulf air corridor,
one of the world's busiest, before the USS Vincennes shot down an
Iranian airliner, American sources said Tuesday.
   All 290 people on the Airbus 300 were killed when the plane was
hit Sunday. A six-man team of U.S. experts led by an admiral
arrived Tuesday to begin a confidential investigation.
   Dozens of aircraft fly over the gulf each day, many on
long-distance flights between Europe and Asia with stops at Dubai,
Bahrain or Kuwait. The Iran Air jet was on a regularly scheduled
short hop across the Strait of Hormuz from Bandar Abbas to Dubai.
   U.S. officials have said the Vincennes fired two anti-aircraft
missiles at the plane in the mistaken belief it was an Iranian F-14
fighter. Iran says the Navy shot the plane down intentionally.
   A U.S. officer said privately he knew of an incident ``about a
month ago'' in which an airliner thought an American warship was
trying to order it to change course when the ship was talking by
radio to a different plane.
   ``The problem was bleed-over from one frequency to another,
which sometimes happens because of harmonics,'' he said. ``The ship
was trying to determine the position and identity of an aircraft, a
non-commercial plane, and this other aircraft heard it and thought
the ship was talking to it.''
   He would not reveal the ship involved, but said he was unaware
of any incident involving the Vincennes. The officer said he did
not know what airline owned the jet involved.
   About 16 U.S. warships are in the gulf at a given time. People
on the bridge of one last month counted the lights of about 20
high-flying aircraft in an hour.
   Another U.S. military source described an incident in mid-June
in which a U.S. missile frigate, making its first trip into the
gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, briefly locked its weapons radar
on an airliner, but quickly realized the mistake.
   ``The best explanation for something like that is
inexperience,'' said the informant, who also insisted his name not
be used.
   ``These crews are always nervous when they come into the gulf
for the first time,'' he said. ``They know it's a war zone, but
they don't know exactly what to expect. And one thing they don't
seem to get the word on is how much commercial air traffic there is
out here.''
   The Washington Post said Tuesday the Vincennes, which arrived in
the gulf May 27, figured in an incident last month in which it
``attempted to redirect'' a jetliner in a way that caused United
Arab Emirates officials to fear a collision of two commercial
planes.
   Quoting an air traffic control official in the Emirates it did
not identify, the paper said the incident June 8 resulted in an
official protest to the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi. It said the
embassy declined comment.
   The officer who said he had no reports of incidents involving
the Vincennes added: ``If it had happened, I would know about it.''
   U.S. Navy spokesmen refused comment on all the reports.
   American military sources said the investigating team had an
initial 15-day mandate but would remain ``as long as it takes to
find out what happened.'' They said the members would work in total
secrecy and make no public statements.
   ``They're going behind closed doors and stay there,'' said a
U.S. Navy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Leading the investigation is Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, who
once commanded the battleship New Jersey and now is plans and
policy director at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla.,
administrative headquarters for U.S. military affairs in 19
countries of the Middle East and North Africa.
   A lawyer and technical specialists, all military officers, also
are on the team. One member is an expert on the ``Aegis'' system of
computer-linked radar and weapons aboard the Vincennes.
   Navy spokesmen said the itinerary was ``not yet set up,'' but
other officials said investigators would visit the Vincennes and
interview Capt. Will C. Rogers III and other officers under oath.
   Rogers, who has commanded the Vincennes for more than a year,
was reported by Pentagon sources to have told his superiors he
acted ``to defend my ship and my crew'' and would do it the same
again in the same circumstances.
   ``This is a burden that I will carry the rest of my life. ... I
alone am responsible,'' he said, according to the Washington
reports.
   Airborne observers said ship traffic in the southern gulf
appeared normal Tuesday and a convoy of U.S.-flagged tankers was
sighted off Ras al-Khaimah in the Emirates, heading for Hormuz.
   It included a Kuwaiti tanker with U.S. registration, the
81,283-ton Sea Isle City; the Navy-chartered tanker Patriot and the
missile frigate Robert G. Bradley, Associated Press photographer
Greg English reported. Eleven Kuwaiti tankers have U.S.
registration and the Navy has escorted them since last July.
   Other traffic included two three-ship groups of Japanese
tankers, one moving in each direction, and a Greek tanker sailing
parallel to the U.S. convoy.

   Iran's U.N. ambassador called today for an
urgent meeting of the Security Council to condemn the United States
for shooting down an Iranian passenger jet.
   Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati also told a news
conference that contrary to assertions of U.S. officials, the
Iranian Airbus, with 290 people aboard, was sending out ``normal
signals ... to all radar that it was a civilian plane.''
   Mahallati said an apology from the United States ``cannot wash
away the blood,'' but said the Reagan administration should
apologize, withdraw immediately from the Persian Gulf and take a
neutral stand in the Iran-Iraq war.
   He said he met today with Security Council President Paulo
Nogueira-Batista of Brazil and requested an urgent meeting of the
council on Sunday's attack on the jetliner by the U.S. missile
cruiser Vincennes.
   The United States says the ship's commander mistakenly believed
the civilian aircraft was an F-14 jet fighter preparing to attack
his ship. President Reagan says the United States will not withdraw
from the gulf.
   Mahallati said the Security Council should call on the United
States to immediately withdraw its forces from the Persian Gulf
``to terminate this kind of barbarism.''
   He denounced the disaster as ``premeditated'' action by the
United States and condemned the ``awkward logic in the U.S. coverup
story about mistaken identity.''
   Mahallati said Iranian military officials told him that ``the
plane for... 14 minutes ... was disseminating the normal signals of
all civilian planes have which proves to any radar that this is a
civilian plane.''
   ``The question is how the most sophisticated American warship in
the Persian Gulf could not receive it,'' he said.
   The Iranian envoy said that the attack on the airliner would not
affect Iran's efforts to improve its relations with other
countries. ``We don't mix our relations with one country and
another, they are independent,'' he said.
   Earlier today, Iran formally demanded that the United Nations
condemn the United States for shooting down the Iran Air jetliner.
   In a letter lodging a formal protest with the world body,
Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati of Iran said the United Nations
should ``condemn this barbaric massacre of innocent civilian
passengers and take immediate measures to prevent further
occurrence of such carnage.''
   The letter, dated Monday and distributed today, said, ``This is
only possible through compelling the United States to remove its
expansionist naval forces from the Persian Gulf.''
   It said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar immediately
should organize an investigation ``on the extent of this latest
American atrocity.''
   On Monday, Perez de Cuellar issued a statement in Geneva, saying
he ``cannot but condemn what appears to have been a tragic error''
and called ``for the greatest restraint in this difficult moment
for the peace and security of the region.
   ``The question of responsibility should not be ignored if a
repetition of such a tragedy is to be avoided,'' he said.
   He said he would continue his efforts to implement a Security
Council resolution that demands an immediate cease-fire in the
nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The Iranian letter said the aircraft, on a scheduled flight from
the southern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas to Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates, was in the ``routine corridor used by civilian
airliners.''
   Iran, it said, repeatedly has protested ``the dangers of the
provocative, illegitimate and expansionist American presence in the
Persian Gulf and repeated acts of aggression against the
sovereignty of Iran.''
   In pursing its aggressive policy, the Iranian minister said,
``the United States has no shame in even targeting civilian
airliners and massacring its passengers in cold blood.''

   An old mansion that was once the headquarters
of the Cleveland chapter of the Universal Negro Improvement
Association will be razed unless $300,000 can be raised soon to
save it, officials say.
   The building is one of the most visible legacies in Cleveland of
Marcus Garvey, the black nationalist who ran an international
shipping line in the 1920s.
   The 106-year-old mansion became vacant in 1982 when UNIA members
could no longer afford to pay utilities and other expenses.
   The Cleveland chapter, which once had thousands of members, now
draws fewer than 10 members at monthly meetings, one reason local
politicians feel no urgency to help Mason A. Hargrave, UNIA's
national president, save the building.
   Cleveland's Board of Building Standards wants to demolish the
building because it is a safety hazard and an eyesore. Arsonists
keep setting it on fire, and vandals have hit several times.
   Hargrave has appealed three rulings from the Board of Building
Standards placing the mansion on demolition lists. Each time he has
won a 120-day reprieve to come up with money to renovate the
building.
   The mansion is on the National Register of Historic places, but
city officials say they cannot wait for Cleveland's UNIA chapter to
raise $300,000 needed to restore the mansion.
   ``The building is not scheduled for demolition yet,'' said
Damian Borkowski, assistant administrator of the city bureau of
demolition. ``Building Standards is holding a meeting next week and
could rule on Mr. Hargrave's appeal.''
   Hargrave said he believes Cleveland owes UNIA a commitment to
save the mansion because of the work the group has done over the
years, including free lunches and tutoring for school children,
both of which were popular UNIA programs before the organization
fell on hard times.

   Firefighters in California, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming and Utah
battled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6,000 acres
of forest and wilderness areas.
   Illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2,200
rugged acres of Stanislaus National Forest in California, 10 miles
west of Yosemite National Park. The fire, which began Saturday, was
declared contained this morning,
   ``We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket,''
said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Forestry.
   The fire was the largest in the forest this year. Stanislaus was
the scene of huge wildfires last summer.
   In southern Utah's scenic Zion National Park, firefighters tried
today to contain a 600-acre fire that was ignited by lightning June
19 but had been allowed to burn in a small area.
   However, on Sunday, winds ranging from 30 mph to 60 mph fanned
the flames out of control, Chief Ranger Bob Andrew said.
Firefighters, assisted by water-carrying aircraft, expected to have
the blaze contained by midday. No injuries or property damage were
reported.
   A four-day fire in 1,100 acres of Hiawatha National Park in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan was also said to be under control,
although continued hot dry weather could mean weeks before the fire
is extinguished.
   ``It's been real quiet out there,'' Sgt. Terry Leisening of the
Delta County Sheriff's Department said today. ``I think they've got
it just about out.''
   U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dale Bluedorn agreed, but said
they will continue to keep patrolling. ``It may not be declared out
until there's a three-day rain,'' he said Monday.
   A small contingent of firefighters who hiked into the
Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness on Monday in south-central Montana
contained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning there
since June 19, forest officials said.
   Forest Service policy allows wilderness fires to burn unless
they threaten trails or structures, or threaten to burn outside the
wilderness boundary.
   The firefighters were called in to stop the flames as they
neared the Stillwater River Trail inside the wilderness area. High
winds Saturday tripled the fire's size.
   Phil Jaquith, Beartooth District ranger for the Custer National
Forest, said the bulk of the fire on the east banks of the
Stillwater River was not being suppressed.
   Cooler temperatures and calmer wind played a role in getting the
blaze contained on the west riverbank, which is about two miles
from the trail, Jaquith said.
   Three-quarters of an inch of rain on Monday helped slow a fire
on 1,650 acres in the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rain
also damped fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   Fire information officer Dave Damron said water was also being
pumped out of bogs in the Shoshone forest to help contain the fire.
Firefighters concentrated on keeping the fire entering the Du Noir
Special Management Area a few miles to the north, Damron said.
   Meanwhile, a fire which burned 8,700 acres in the Tonto National
Forest north of Phoenix, Ariz., was reported extinguished on Monday.

   Out-of-court settlements to survivors of
57 soldiers killed in a 1985 Arrow Air crash have averaged nearly
twice the amount paid in major airline crashes from 1970 to 1984,
The Courier-Journal reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper examined cases settled since January 1987 and said
the Arrow Air cases were settled for an average of $663,000,
ranging from $171,000 to $1.5 million.
   The litigation arose from a Dec. 12, 1985, crash at Gander,
Newfoundland, that killed all eight crew members and 248 troops on
board. The soldiers, members of the 101st Airborne Division, were
returning to Fort Campbell after six months in the Middle East.
   All 130 lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for western
Kentucky have been settled, and one case, in Florida, is pending
for trial.
   Citing a court order and other reasons, Arrow's insurer has
declined to disclose the value of settlements. But the newspaper
calculated the size of some accords based on contributions by
plaintiffs' lawyers to a fund that covers litigation expenses.
Since Jan. 12, 1987, the lawyers have been required to place 0.5
percent of settlements in the fund.
   An extrapolation of those figures shows that since that date,
Arrow's insurer, Associated Aviation Underwriters, paid $37.8
million to settle the 57 cases, the newspaper said.
   John Martin, Associated Aviation Underwriters' attorney,
confirmed the settlement values calculated by the newspaper.
   Geneva Parris, liaison counsel for the plaintiffs, also
confirmed the figures. She said the accords struck after January
1987 were generally higher than those reached before then.
   A Rand Corp. study found an average of $362,943 was paid for
passengers killed in major airline crashes from 1970 to 1984.
Although that average has risen dramatically in the 1980s, the
Arrow settlements still exceed the $500,000 figure the National Law
Journal has reported was paid from 1980 to 1984.
   Martin said the Arrow settlements are generally in line with
those negotiated after other recent airline disasters.
   But plaintiffs' lawyers, including Richard Brown, a partner of
San Francisco's Melvin Belli and secretary of the aviation section
of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, say the Arrow
awards exceed recent averages.
   Lee Kreindler, a leading aviation lawyer, said the settlements
are noteworthy because the Arrow passengers were soldiers with
lower earning potential than many other victims of air disasters
such as business executives.
   Members of the plaintiffs' team attributed the relatively large
Arrow settlements to the generosity of Associated and to a Kentucky
law that allows for liberal recovery of future earnings.

<HEAD>Negotiators Begin Review Of U.S. Bases Labor Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Philippine officials Tuesday
began a review of the labor agreement covering six American bases,
whose closure would directly affect about 68,000 Filipino workers.
   The bases are the second-largest employer in the Philippines
after the government.
   The review of the Base Labor Agreement is to determine the wages
and rights of Filipino workers on the U.S.-run Clark Air Base,
Subic Bay Naval Base and four other smaller facilities in the
Philippines.
   In April, officials from both sides began an overall
re-examination of the 1947 agreement, which allows the United
States to operate the six military bases in the Phillipines and
expires in 1991. The officials agreed to discuss the labor issue in
a separate review.
   ``The future of the facilities in the Philippines is
uncertain,'' U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said at opening
ceremonies to Tuesday's session. ``There are many, in both
countries, who believe the facilities should be removed. This will
have a direct impact on each worker, his family, and his
community.''
   The panel is expected to demand higher wages, the right of
workers to strike and bargain collectively, and the application of
Philippine labor laws to the Filipino workers in the bases, sources
at the Department of Foreign Affairs said.
   U.S. negotiators are expected to oppose the demands, citing a
provision in the agreement that allows Washington ``unhampered
operations'' in the bases.
   The United States Information Service says the six bases employ
68,514 Filipinos, for a total annual salary of about $96 million.
   The Manila government receives about $180 million annually in
military and economic aid from Washington in exchange for the use
of the bases. But Philippine negotiators are asking the United
States to increase the aid package for the remaining three years of
the agreement.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who heads the Philippine
panel, said before the talks that $1.2 billion annually would be a
``realistic'' increase.

   A gun club must pay a woman $100 in damages for
denying her membership application in 1980 and admit her as a full
member, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   The Concord Rod and Gun Club Inc. had appealed a Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination order, affirmed by a lower court,
that Donna Page was unconstitionally excluded from the all-male
club.
   The club argued that it was not ``public'' under the definition
of state anti-discrimination laws.
   Membership in the club was limited to 300 people, 70 percent of
whom lived in or around Concord. Applicants had to be at least 21
years old or have parental permission to join, had to be eligible
for a state sporting license and, at least at the time Page applied
for membership, had to be male.
   However, the justices wrote there were no other stated
restrictions on eligibility, and noted a commission conclusion that
``obtaining sponsorship and co-sponsorship was easy to do and was
tantamount to acceptance of an applicant as a member of the club.''
   Every one of the 52 male applicants in 1980 _ the year Page
applied _ and 1981 were accepted, the court said.
   ``While it is true that several factors tend to show that the
club is not open to, and does not accept, the patronage of the
general public, the determinative factor in this case ... is the
total absense of genuine selectivity of membership,'' the justices
said in a unanimous decision by Justice Francis P. O'Connor.

   A thief stole the profits from two girls'
lemonade stand, but one victim was prepared with an insurance
policy of sorts.
   ``My mom and dad are going to give me the $13 I had earned,''
said 11-year-old Heather Rahhal.
   Heather and her friend, 13-year-old Hanna Kemp, have sold
lemonade and iced tea at the fireworks display on the Arkansas
River for the past six years.
   ``They do real well,'' said Bonnie Rahhal, Heather's mom. ``It's
always been a pleasurable experience. This year they cried and
thought it seemed real unfair.''
   Sgt. John Bowman said three boys about 16 or 17 years old
approached the girls about 11 p.m. Monday and one ran off with a
cigar box containing the $26.
   ``Both dads tried to pursue but lost him,'' Mrs. Rahhal said.
   ``It just seems like a crummy thing to do,'' the mother added.
``It takes them about two or three days of work.''

   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., recovering from
a double-lung transplant, celebrated the Fourth of July weekend by
getting married in his room at the University of Mississippi
Medical Center.
   A spokesman for Spence said Tuesday that he married Deborah
Williams of Lexington in a private ceremony Sunday in Jackson, Miss.
   The 60-year-old Spence had the lung transplant in May. Hospital
spokeswoman Barbara Austin said Tuesday that Spence is continuing
to progress and is in satisfactory condition.
   ``He's been looking forward to the marriage since before the
surgery, it's one of the things he's been anxious to do,'' said
Randy Mashburn, a spokesman for the congressman.
   ``Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we're looking for
(Spence) to be discharged within 10 days to two weeks,'' said
Mashburn.
   ``He's about to come out of the hospital and get back to work
and back to Washington. He'll worry about getting back on the
campaign trail later,'' he said.
   This is the first marriage for Mrs. Spence, 37. Spence's first
wife died in 1977.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo, notebook and tape
recorder in hage _ one elite, well-to-do and often associated with
government officials, the other poor and struggling.
   This city, long regarded as a pioneer for black progress and a
center for nearly every aspect of black culture and politics, is
faced with a deteroriating relationship between the two classes of
blacks.
   One source of the problem is that blacks do not control the
economic pursestrings in Atlanta, even though they hold top
political offices, according to Lyndon Wade, executive director of
the Atlanta Urban League.
   ``You cannot run a city with politics alone; you must have an
economic base to make it go. That's why there's a lot of pressure
in the older black community,'' said Wade.
   Tensions between the two classes begin early, according to
Morehouse College sociologist Anna Grant. In school, poor children
start to understand that some of their black classmates enjoy
material advantages inaccessible to them. Since the city's elected
black officials usually are among the elite, the poor come to view
government and the elite as one.
   Poor blacks feel especially betrayed at slights from a black
administration, said Mrs. Grant. And in May their mistrust showed
at the ballot box, when voters overwhelmingly defeated a $308
million proposal for improving roads, schools, police protection
and other major services.
   Elected black leaders who had heavily promoted the bond issue in
their own circles denounced the vote at a black-tie ``victory''
party. However, another group of black officials, who had pushed
for rejection in the city's poorer areas, celebrated with
cornbread, pig neckbones and Sprite.
   ``This is a new political day in Atlanta,'' shouted maverick
City Councilman Hosea Williams. ``This is the death of black elite
control of Atlanta.''
   Atlanta homeowners, already chafed by a sudden reassessment that
raised property taxes for thousands, said they voted against the
plan because they weren't told exactly where the $308 million would
go.
   The election was a slap in the face to members of the black
elite long accustomed to controlling the black vote, according to
Mrs. Grant, who said the message was: ``They can't assume that they
speak for all blacks.''
   Atlanta's black leadership had put forth a united front in 1972
to support Maynard Jackson's successful bid to become the city's
first black mayor. Two years later, disputes began to divide the
old guard of business and civic leaders and a newer class of young
professionals.
   Jackson's administration weathered a police cheating scandal,
the serial murders of young blacks and a crime rate that soared
each year, giving the city a national reputation for lawlessness.
These problems ravaged the black community, and by the end of the
Jackson administration poorer communities were accusing him of not
seeking solutions.
   History has repeated itself.
   The young professionals of the 1970s are now being lumped with
the old elite by young professionals of the 1980s, most of whom
migrated from other areas to create their own brand of Atlantan,
said Mrs. Grant, who advised Jackson on annexation issues.
   Those of the new group who live in the city now chide Mayor
Andrew Young about his globe-trotting and lack of attention to
municipal issues.
   His administration has endured a grand jury probe of the way
police handled charges of cocaine use among prominent blacks, a
series of police shootings of poor blacks and the extortion
convictions of two black Fulton County commissioners. Now the poor
accuse Young of a lack of concern for the disadvantaged.
   ``They were handed the same promises before blacks came to
power. But they expected blacks to keep their promises,'' Mrs.
Grant said. ``There's a struggle for greater accountability. It's
making people ask `Are we better off because we have blacks in
power positions? Or are we no better off?'''
   Wade, of the Urban League, said the city's blacks aren't helped
when suburban financial interests that wield economic control tout
the city as one with good race relations and a thriving black
community.
   Atlanta's glowing reputation as a New South capital brought
346,000 new jobs, $15 billion in new investments and 78,000 people
to the metropolitan area in 1987.
   However, newly arrived blacks find a confusing blend of Atlanta
_ the metro area, where 1980 census figures show 25 percent of 2.1
million residents are black, and the city itself, where the census
showed 67 percent of 430,500 residents are black and 27.5 percent
of residents live below the poverty line.
   ``It's not the case that all Atlanta blacks live good,'' Wade
said. ``Atlanta is very deceptive. Name three buildings over two
stories high that are owned by blacks. Yes, Atlanta has a long
history of blacks being involved in the core life of the city. But
when you talk about are we truly, truly making the kind of progress
that one would expect, then I would have to say the answer is no.''
   Still, he said, ``a lot of people get caught up in the potential
for change and the potential for great things. That keeps everybody
here.''

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Sign Beef-Citrus Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fartm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement opening Japan to more American
beef and citrus was signed Tuesday by officials of the two
countries.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called it ``a great
day for American agriculture, a great day for Japanese consumers.''
   Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's ambassador to the United States, said
the pact marked ``an end to the decade-long trade issue between the
two governments.''
   The agreement, which was reached last month during negotiations
in Tokyo, will open the door gradually over the next few years to
more U.S. beef and citrus and move away from the restrictive quota
system that has been in effect.
   Earlier demands that Japan allow sales of U.S. rice were dropped
in reaching the settlement on beef and citrus.
   Yeutter said he hoped Japan would relent on allowing rice
imports but that such discussions would be more appropriate in the
current Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   Matsunaga said Japan has made it clear that ``we will not refuse
to discuss the matter of rice'' in GATT negotiations on condition
that other participating countries are prepared to discuss their
own agricultural policies.
   The Commerce Department has estimated that annual U.S. beef
exports to Japan could grow to around $1 billion a year from about
$550 million now. Sales of oranges and juice, now less than $100
million, could rise to more than $150 million, it says.
   Yeutter said in a statement that the signing was a ``historic
development'' for both countries.
   ``It settles one of our most controversial bilateral disputes,''
he said. ``Just as important, it demonstrates that Japan is
accepting even more responsibility as a major trading nation.''
   Yeutter noted that the agreement not only commits Japan to
increase access and eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade in beef,
oranges and orange juice but reducess tariffs on a variety of other
products, including lemons, grapefruit and nuts.
   In a formal exchange of letters dated July 5, Matsunaga said the
government of Japan ``intends to implement market-opening
measures'' as indicated by the agreement and will be prepared to
hold consultations annually with the United States to discuss how
the arrangement is faring.
   Yeutter said in his letter that GATT officials have been
notified of the withdrawal of a U.S. complaint regarding Japanese
import restrictions on beef, fresh oranges and orange juice. The
Florida citrus industry also has withdrawn a petition calling for a
U.S. investigation of Japanese restrictions on fresh oranges and
juice, he said.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., called the agreement ``a big win for
beef producers and Japanese consumers'' but cautioned that the
United States ``must ensure the agreement is carried out'' properly.
   ``This is but the first step in what must be a sustained effort
to increase beef exports,'' Baucus said in a statement. ``Constant
pressure on Japan by Congress, the administration and private
groups finally paid off.''

<HEAD>Chess Champion Troubled by Ethnic Dispute In Azerbaijan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFORT, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov said
Tuesday he was troubled by the ethnic problems in his home republic
of Azerbaijan, and that they have been simmering under the surface
there for 20 years.
   Kasparov also said Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ``played
brilliantly'' in setting his reform programs in motion, and said
that if chess terms were applied to politicians, the Soviet leader
would be rated a grandmaster.
   Kasparov, who is half Armenian but lives in Baku, the capital of
Azerbaijan, says he is ``always trying to find a compromise, an
acceptable solution for both sides'' in the dispute between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Armenians are predominantly Christian and have clashed with
Azerbaijanis, who are mostly Shiite Moslem. The Armenians demand
that the region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan be annexed to
Armenia.
   Speaking in English, the 25-year-old chess champion said the
regional dispute was ``a real problem for 20 years,'' but had been
kept ``underground'' until recently.
   He suggested one acceptable solution might be to ``give the
biggest posible autonomy for Nagorno-Kabarakh within Azerbaijan.''
   He said allowing the region to secede could be seen by Soviet
authorities as too dangerous since similar problems exist in Soviet
Central Asia, the Baltic republics and western Ukraine.
   Kasparov, in an interview with The Associated Press following
his victory in the World Cup chess tournament that ended Monday,
said he kept up with events from the national Communist Party
conference in Moscow by telephoning the capital and listening over
the receiver to speeches from the meeting that were broadcast on
Soviet TV.
   Kasparov said many people in Moscow are ill-informed about the
the southern republics.
   ``It's another world,'' he said. ``How can you understand people
in Rio de Janeiro when you are living in New York?''
   Kasparov denounced the violence committed by Azerbaijani mobs
against Armenians in the coastal city of Sumgait on Feb. 28. At
least 32 people were killed, mostly Armenians. One rioter was
sentenced on May 16 to 15 years in prison and others are expected
to be tried on charges stemming from the riots.
   ``Sumgait was a big criminal event, maybe one of the biggest in
our history,'' Kasparov said, adding that he supported the
punishment of those involved in the violence.
   Gorbachev, in a speech at the beginning of the conference,
denounced demands for border changes in Armenia and Azerbaijan.

   Laboratory tests found no poison in an orange
juice carton on which a note was pinned with an intravenous drug
needle threatening contamination, officials said today.
   The discovery of the 64-ounce carton in a Woodland Hills
supermarket on Monday prompted company officials to pull the Vons
store's supply of the product, said Vons spokeswoman Mary McAboy.
However, no other stores will take the product off its shelves
while the investigation continues.
   ``We believe it to be an isolated incident,'' said Ms. McAboy.
``There was no indication of anything like this in any other
store.''
   No injuries were reported after a customer alerted store
officials about 2 p.m. Monday of the carton, said Lt. Lee Lorenze.
   ``The note threatened contamination,'' Ms. McAboy said.
Authorities refused to release its exact wording.
   Earlier police reports that a syringe was in the carton were
incorrect, she said.
   The store voluntarily pulled the orange juice and hired a
company to conduct a preliminary test of the product with the note,
Ms. McAboy said.
   Although the preliminary test indicated poison might be present,
a more thorough test found no contamination, she said.

   A drunken teen-ager was critically injured when
he struck an overhead electric cable while playing atop a parked
Long Island Rail Road train in Penn Station, a spokesman said
Tuesday.
   LIRR spokesman Grian Dolan said 11,000 volts of electricity shot
through Humerto E. Diaz's body, setting his clothes on fire.
   Diaz's friend, John Zokowski, suffered minor burns to his hands
while pulling his friend from the train's roof and trying to

   ``We really haven't been able to talk to Diaz at great length so
we don't know what led him to climb on top of the roof,'' Dolan
said. ``But blood tests from the hospital show he had consumed an
awful lot of alcohol.''
   Both teen-agers, who live in suburban Port Washington, were
taken to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center's burn unit.
   Diaz was in critical condition with second and third-degree
burns over 40 percent of his body, said hospital spokesman Jonathan
Weil. Zokowski was in stable condition with first-degree burns on
his hands.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Education Is a Top Election Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public sees education as a top issue in
this year's presidential race, and a majority resists higher taxes
to boost teacher pay, according to a poll commissioned by the
National Education Association.
   On a scale of 1-5, with 5 representing a ``most important
issue,'' 77 percent ranked the quality of public education at least
a 4, ahead of a dozen other foreign and domestic issues including
drugs, AIDS, U.S.-Soviet Relations, nuclear weapons policy, the
federal deficit and homelessness.
   ``The American people understand the need for change. And they
clearly indicate, in this poll, that they want to make education a
national priority,'' said Don Cameron, executive director of the
NEA, which is holding its annual convention here this week.
   The annual survey of public attitudes on education was conducted
by the Gallup organization for the 1.9 million-member teacher
union. The poll surveyed 2,113 Americans by telephone between March
31 and April 20, and had a margin of error of plus or minus two
percent.
   It found that 54 percent either favored higher teacher salaries
only if it means no tax increase, or opposed additional funds from
any source for increasing salaries. Forty-three percent favored
better salaries even if that raised taxes. The remaining 3 percent
were undecided.
   The poll also found that:
   _ Drugs ranked second as a presidential campaign issue, with 75
percent rating it a 4 or 5. Sixty-nine percent considered U.S.
ability to compete economically as critical. The federal deficit
and homelessness were cited by 67 percent, and AIDS by 66 percent.
   _ Twenty-nine percent said underfunding of schools by
politicians and other public officials was the chief roadblock to
reform. School administrators with unclear reform goals were cited
by 25 percent, and 16 percent blamed teachers or teacher unions.
   _ Sixty-three percent felt teachers should have more control
selecting textbooks. Sixty-six percent wanted teachers to be able
to decide how to teach in class, and 61 percent wanted them to set
discipline policy. However, only 35 percent thought teachers should
control the scheduling of the school day.
   In a speech to the convention, National Teacher of the Year
Terry Weeks of Murfreesboro, Tenn., accuse school reformers of
failing to ``give us much credit for our dedication,'' of putting
too much stress on testing students and teachers, and of
``virtually ignoring the needs of the at-risk students in
elementary school.''
   He urged the 8,227 teacher-delegates to include values in their
classrooms.
   ``While we focus on the almighty test score, we know deep down
inside that it is not just the test score that will determine the
real worth of each student,'' he said.
   The union awarded its ``Friend of Education Award'' to Rep.
Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif. Hawkins, who chairs the House
Education and Labor Committee, was instrumental in passing key
education measures aimed at assisting elementary and secondary
school programs.

   An atheist who was convicted of drunken
driving claims that his constitutional rights were violated when he
was ordered to attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous.
   AA's reference to ``a higher spirit'' and ``spiritual
fellowship'' during meetings is at the heart of the dispute.
   John Norfolk, 47, contends that being forced to attend AA
meetings violates his rights under the First Amendment, which says
that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohbiting the free exercise thereof.''
   Queen Anne's County District Judge John T. Clark had given
Norfolk the choice of attending AA meetings once a week as part of
his probation from his conviction or spending 20 days in jail.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing
Norfolk, maintains the meetings preach religious healing and the
state can't force anyone to to attend a religious gathering. The
group has asked Clark to review the sentence.
   Ellen Luff, Norfolk's attorney, said, ``We are not attacking AA
at all. What we're saying is that the state has no right to send
someone who is an atheist to a theist meeting.''
   ``They don't talk about drinking. They talk about God 50 percent
of the time,'' said Norfolk. ``I might as well be going to church
on Sundays or listening to Jimmy Swaggart.''
   However, Myrna McCusker, clinical supervisor at the alcohol
services division of the county health department, said the program
is not religious. Having gone through the program herself, she
said, ``AA is what works best for most people. I tried everything
else but nothing worked.''
   McCusker said she complained about the reference to God at AA
meetings 15 years ago when she went for treatment and ``it allowed
me to keep on drinking.''
   Stuart Comstock-Gay, ACLU director in Maryland, said there have
been a few cases in Maryland where the AA treatment program has
been challenged in lower courts and the judge has ordered the
driver to attend an alternative program. ``That's what we're hoping
the judge will do in this case,'' he said.
   Clark, who is expected to rule sometime this month on the case,
said he was not aware of any religious references at the meetings.
   Annette Rentz, coordinator of the state Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Administration treatment program, said AA was not religious. ``It
is a support group that works and is effective,'' she said.
   ``We're in the process of reducing the problem of drunk driving.
This would definitely be a setback.'' said Ms. Rentz. She said some
10,200 motorists convicted of drunk driving who were treated in
state outpatient programs last year were required to attend AA
meetings as part of their probation.

<HEAD>Conflicting Leaflets Attempt to Lead to Arab Disarray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two rival leaflets signed by the same
clandestine Arab leaders were distributed in the occupied
territories Tuesday, and some Palestinians said the conflicting
directives were an attempt to plunge the Arab uprising into
disarray.
   The leaflets, both signed by the PLO-linked United National
Leadership of the Uprising, sparked confusion among Palestinians.
But it was not known if the contradictory orders signaled a rift
among leaders of the nearly 7-month-old rebellion.
   Israeli troops, meanwhile, shot and wounded a 17-year-old Arab
in the chest in the West Bank city of Nablus, officials of the
city's Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   The army confirmed the casualty, and said the soldiers opened
fire after Arab youths hurled rocks at them from a rooftop in the
Nablus marketplace.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8 against Israel's 21-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 215 Palestinians and
four Israelis have been killed.
   Also Tuesday, Arabs observed a PLO-ordered general strike that
shut down shops, halted public transportation and turned cities in
the occupied territories and Arab east Jerusalem into virtual ghost
towns.
   Most of about 120,000 Palestinians who work in Israel also
stayed away from their jobs, Arab radio reports said.
   Some Palestinians told The Associated Press the conflicting
leaflets were aimed at plunging the Arab uprising into disarray by
creating confusion among Palestinians over which directive to obey.
   They speculated that one of the leaflets was planted by Israeli
security officials to spark dissension among Palestinians and give
the appearance that underground leaders were divided. But they
disagreed over which one was fake.
   Army officials declined comment.
   The Palestinians rejected the possibility that the leaflets were
a sign of infighting among uprising leaders. Since the unrest
began, Palestinians have repeatedly stressed that they are united
behind their leadership.
   ``Someone is trying his best to make people start questioning
how many leaderships we have. The aim is to create problems,'' said
Mahdi Abdul Hadi, the head of an east Jerusalem-based group of
Palestinian academics.
   ``Who benefits from such problems? The Israelis. They can say
`Look at those Palestinians disagreeing with each other. They don't
know what they want until now,''' he said.
   One leaflet called for a general strike Friday and another
seven-day strike beginning Sunday, while the other ordered only a
two-day strike over the weekend.
   One leaflet also addressed a rift between the Palestine
Liberation Organization and more radical Palestinian factions over
whether to endorse peace negotiations with Israel.
   The leaflet praised a statement by PLO deputy Abu Shariff
advocating negotiations and the creation of a Palestinian state
alogside Israel. Shariff's statement has prompted sharp criticism
from radical Palestinian leaders.
   Arab journalist Daoud Kuttab said raising the Abu Shariff
statement was bound to create discord, no matter who issued the
leaflets.
   ``This is like a hot potato, so taking any position is a formula
for internal fighting,'' said Kuttab, who writes for the
Palestinian daily A-Sinnara, which is published in Nazareth.
   ``It would indicate a rift in the uprising leadership if the
leaflet is genuine, but it means nothing if the Israelis forged it.
My feeling is the aim was to create confusion,'' Kuttab said in an
interview.
   Also Tuesday, the army blew up two homes in the biblical town of
Bethlehem. The houses belonged to Arabs suspected of staging
firebomb attacks, the military command said.
   ``We shall reach ... any man who has thrown a firebomb in cold
blood, intending to kill everyone here,'' Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir, a
West Bank commander, told Israel army radio.
   Economics Minister Gad Yaakobi blamed the uprising for an
economic slowdown in Israel, saying it had cost the same amount as
the country's real growth, or about 3 percent to 3.5 percent of the
gross national product of $27 billion. The percentage equals about
$900 million.
   In May, Israeli officials said the uprising had cost Israel
about $560 million in lost tourist income, uncollected taxes and
added military expenses.

   Teamsters president Jackie Presser was
reported in fair condition Tuesday at Lakewood Hospital, where he
will undergo physical and respiratory therapy during the next few
days.
   Presser, 61, who is suffering from brain tumors, was rushed to
the hospital by ambulance June 28 complaining of dizziness and
weakness. The symptoms were caused by a blood clot that reached
Presser's right lung, physicians say.
   Doctors said last week that the clot had stabilized and should
eventually dissolve. A screen was implanted in a vein below
Presser's kidneys last week to block additional blood clots from
moving to his lungs, the hospital said.
   Presser was hospitalized just hours after the U.S. government
filed a lawsuit in New York to break alleged Mafia domination of
the 1.6-million member Teamsters, the nation's largest labor union.
   On May 4, Presser relinquished his duties as union president for
four months because of poor health. Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer
Weldon L. Mathis has assumed those duties.
   Presser had been scheduled to go on trial July 12 in Cleveland
on federal charges of embezzlement and racketeering. Because of his
health problems, a federal judge postponed the trial indefinitely.

<TEXT>
   A court on Tuesday recessed the
trial of a Lebanese Shiite Moslem accused in the 1985 hijacking of
a TWA airliner, after he refused to take part in the first day of
proceedings.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is charged with murder and air piracy,
cited disputes over his interpreter and his legal representation
for his refusal to participate.
   ``I don't say anything important until we have an interpreter,''
he said in broken German. The trial is scheduled to resume Thursday.
   West German attorney Rainer Hamm said the parents of U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Md., who was killed in the 17-day
hijacking, were in the courtroom for the first day of the session.
   Stethem was among 39 Americans held hostage when four armed men
hijacked the TWA plane on June 14, 1985, on a flight from Athens to
Rome and forced it to land in Beirut.
   Hamm, who represents 11 Americans who have intervened to
prosecute the case, said he hopes Richard and Patricia Stethem's
presence would be seen as a ``gesture of trust and not of
mistrust'' in the German judicial system.
   But Hamm said the location of the trial in West Germany was
influenced by ``terrorists in Hamadi's circles'' who had taken two
West Germans hostage in Lebanon after Hamadi's arrest in Frankfurt
in 1987.
   ``The crime has been committed, but it has not yet ended,'' Hamm
said.
   West German businessmen Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt were
kidnapped in Beirut, Lebanon a few days after Hamadi was arrested
at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987.
   Government officials later admitted concern for the two
kidnapped men influenced a West German decision not to extradite
Hamadi to the United States to stand trial there.
   Schmidt was released in September in what his captors said was a
goodwill gesture, but Cordes remains a hostage.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was sentenced in April
by a Duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping Schmidt
and Cordes in Beirut in a bid to gain freedom for his brother.
   The clean-shaven Hamadi entered the high-security courtroom
wearing a light blue shirt, no tie and blue trousers. He previously
had worn a beard.
   Several hundred heavily armed policemen were on the scene, and
about 60 spectators and 80 journalists were searched twice before
entering the courtroom inside Preungesheim prison.
   During the session, interrupted twice to study defense motions
and another time when Hamadi said he had a headache, the defendent
refused to answer when questioned about his birthplace and age.
   Hamadi, in his only statements, gave his name and requested the
defense lawyer and an interpreter who was familiar with his Arabic
dialect. The court declined both requests.
   The Frankfurt juvenile court will first look into the question
of Hamadi's age to determine whether he should be tried as a
juvenile, young adult or adult. Under West German law, a juvenile
is less than age 18, an adult is age 21 and older, and a young
adult is between 18 and 21.
   Depending on various rulings on age and maturity questions,
Hamadi could face anywhere from 15 years to life in prison if
convicted.
   The West German indictment lists Hamadi's birthdate as June 13,
1964, making him 21 years old at the time of the hijacking. Hamadi
also has claimed he was born in 1966.

<TEXT>
   For generations, New Yorkers have relied on the
sidewalk newsstand for daily doses of truth (``BLAZE KILLS 5
FIREMEN''), beauty (``BEAUTY SECRETS FROM A TOP MODEL!'') and
street smarts.
   Vito Gasparo has been dispensing all three from the corner of
47th Street and Sixth Avenue for 41 years, and right now his street
smarts tell him that Mayor Edward I. Koch is ``crazy in the head.''
   Gasparo's concern for the mayor's sanity stems from a Koch
administration proposal that could put as many as 80 percent of the
city's newsstands out of business.
   The proposal would change the requirements for newsstands so
that they would have to be, for example, at least 25 feet from the
nearest subway entrance and two feet from a curb, manhole, parking
meter or telephone pole.
   City planners say the newsstands block pedestrian traffic and
contribute to congestion on the sidewalks _ a charge that few would
dispute.
   ``We're concerned if a newsstand blocks the free egress of a
crosswalk,'' explained Victor Ross, a city Transportation
Department spokesman. ``We're also concerned if the stand so
constricts space that people don't have anyplace to walk on the
sidewalk.''
   A casual inspection of Manhattan newsstands suggests that few
could comply with the new rules.
   ``The impact would be incredibly disastrous on what is left of
the newsstand industry in this city,'' said Robert S. Bookman, a
lawyer who represents the New York City Newsstand Operators
Association.
   New York's 280 or so newsstands dispense more than a sometimes
staggering selection of newspapers and magazines. Many also sell
candy, sodas, maps, baseball caps or cheap jewelry.
   Newsstand operators give directions to tourists, provide a
comforting beacon of light on dark streets and, some people
believe, help deter crime.
   Once, newsstands were the exclusive province of the blind and
disabled military veterans; recently, their ranks have been joined
by immigrants, particularly from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
   ``What're they gonna do, put these people back on welfare?''
asked Tom DeSanto, an optician who is a regular customer at a Sixth
Avenue newsstand operated by Edward Lanigan, who is blind.
   Another blind newsstand operator lost his stand in Brooklyn last
week when city sanitation crews mistakenly razed it. Although Koch
publicly apologized and the man was given a replacement, the case
helped focus attention on the city's newsstand campaign.
   The more cynical of Koch's critics see political motives in the
plan.
   ``I am particularly outraged that these new and onerous
regulations ... come at a time when the complexion of those who own
the newsstands in this city is changing,'' said Wilbert Tatum,
publisher of the city's largest black newspaper, the Amsterdam
News. Tatum said the elimination of newsstands would ``decimate''
his profits, which are heavily based on street sales.
   The free-standing sidewalk stands, which range from shabby to
seedily ornate, represent only a fraction of the news outlets in
the city. Stan Getleson, circulation manager of the New York Post,
said Tuesday, that there are about 4,500 sellers including stands
in the subways, cubbyholes in buildings, lobby newsstands and
bookstores.
   Still, the newsstands have adamant defenders.
   ``The only legal thing on the streets seems to be the
newsstands, so it is naturally the newsstands that the city is
attempting to curb,'' wrote New York Daily News columnist Gail
Collins.
   City officials seem slightly taken aback.
   ``The mayor has by no means accepted'' the regulations, mayoral
spokesman Larry Simonberg said, adding that Koch had no intention
of eliminating newsstands.
   ``They might have to move,'' Simonberg insisted, ``but we are
not seeking to oust anybody.''
   And if, as Bookman suggested, the regulations would outlaw 80
percent of the city's newsstands?
   ``I don't believe any such thing would be acceptable,''
Simonberg said.

<HEAD>College President Repays School for Questionable Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Westfield State College
has reportedly repaid the school $1,259 for meals with educators
who don't recall dining with him, dinners with professors who don't
exist and other expenses.
   State records obtained by the Union-News newspaper of
Springfield indicate that Irving Buchen also billed the school at
least $1,200 in travel expenses for his wife, Devy, saying she
often participated in conferences he attends.
   The records, however, showed no registration fees for Mrs.
Buchen, an opera singer, according to the account published Tuesday.
   Buchen said through his secretary Tuesday that he would have no
comment on the report, but he told the newspaper: ``I never
deliberately misled anyone.''
   A spokesman for the state Board of Regents, which hired Buchen
to replace a president who resigned in a scandal, said Chairman
Edward Lash and Chancellor Franklyn Jenifer would ``be in touch
with the trustees'' of the college.
   He added that the regents have no legal authority over how
public college presidents spend school trust funds. Under state
law, the presidents are free to draw on the funds for any purpose
that promotes the school.
   ``Clearly we're concerned about this issue,'' said regents
spokesman Terry Zoulas.
   The head of Westfield State's board of trustees, Jane Berry, was
at meetings Tuesday and her secretary said she could not be reached
for comment. Ms. Berry has said, however, that trustees ``had
questions about whether some of Dr. Buchen's expenses were
legitimate.''
   Buchen, 57, earns $77,000 yearly and receives $1,000 monthly in
living expenses. He became president 15 months ago, replacing
Francis J. Pilecki, who resigned after being indicted in 1986 on
sexual assault charges. Pilecki was found innocent in one case
brought by a male student and charges were dropped in another case
after settlement of a civil suit.
   Among the questionable expenses cited was a $26 business meal
with Helen Popovitch, president of Florida Atlantic University, who
told the newspaper she never dined with Buchen. He later said he
had made a bookkeeping error.
   Two other college presidents listed on meal vouchers totaling
$76 _ Harold Eichoff of Trenton State College in New Jersey and
John Van de Wetering of the State University of New York at
Brockport _ also didn't recall dining with Buchen.
   Buchen said the bills were actually for dinners with his wife
that he considered legitimate business expenses.
   Buchen was praised in a preliminary report issued last month by
the New England Association of Schools and Colleges for helping
Westfield State recover from the trauma suffered by the Pilecki
allegations, but he has also come under fire for using $16,000 in
trust funds to renovate his office.
   In January, he acknowledged that he waived the college's
entrance requirements to allow his 16-year-old daughter to enroll
as a student, but later took her out of the school and apologized
to trustees.

   The police chief of this small city in
southeastern Minnesota was shot and killed early today, and two
suspects were arrested later in Missouri, authorities said.
   Police Chief Gregory Lange was dead on arrival at St. Marys
Hospital in Rochester at 3:30 a.m., Olmsted County Coroner Kathryn
Berg said.
   Authorities declined to comment in detail this morning on the
circumstances of the shooting as they cordoned off a city block
near Lange's home in Claremont, a city of about 600 about 25 miles
west of Rochester.
   The suspects were arrested without incident on Interstate 35 in
Clinton County, Mo., about 300 miles from the Minnesota city, said
Trooper Londell Jamerson with the Missouri Highway Patrol.
   Missouri Patrol Sgt. William Monahan identified the suspects as
Andrew Salinas and Robert Salinas, adding he didn't know whether
they were related.
   Monahan said Lange responded to a report of a domestic dispute
at the home of Andrew Salinas and his wife and that the two men
scuffled briefly before the chief was shot once in the chest. The
body of the chief, he said, was found outside the Salinas home,
about 50 yards away from his own house.
   Troopers recovered a handgun and what appeared to be a police
radio from the car, Jamerson said. Earlier, Lange's patrol car was
found in Blooming Prairie, about 10 miles south of Claremont, said
Major Richard Steffen of the Minnesota State Patrol.
   Lange, police chief since January 1986, admitted last October to
stealing most of his grandmother's estate, forcing her to mortgage
a farm to pay her nursing home bills, according to Iowa officials.
Lange pleaded guilty to first-degree theft last month and was to be
sentenced July 25, County Attorney Bruce Green of O'Brien County
said.
   Lange admitted that he took more than $60,000 from the woman's
account for his own use, Green said.
   The police chief faced up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000
fine. Green said he had planned to make no sentencing
recommendation because the other beneficiaries of the woman's
estate asked that Lange not be prosecuted.

<TEXT>
   A teacher fired nine years ago because
she had tuberculosis has been ordered reinstated by a federal judge
who found that she was a victim of discrimination, her attorney
said Tuesday.
   The lawsuit of Gene Arline, 45, became a landmark case when the
U.S. Supreme Court on March 3, 1987, ruled 7-2 that
anti-discrimination laws cover people suffering from AIDS and other
contagious illnesses.
   The high court ordered a new fact-finding trial for Mrs. Arline,
which was held here in May before U.S. District Judge John Moore.
   Moore, in an order filed Friday, found that Mrs. Arline was a
victim of discrimination and ordered her reinstated with four years
back pay totaling more than $100,000, said Patricia Fields
Anderson, Mrs. Arline's attorney.
   ``We are ecstatic,'' Ms. Anderson said Tuesday. ``It has been a
long nine years.''
   The judge said the Nassau County school board must either
reinstate Mrs. Arline or pay an additional $768,000 in ``front
pay'' to take her up to retirement, Ms. Anderson said. The board's
attorney indicated Tuesday that the district will rehire her, the
attorney said.
   ``She is going to be, hopefully, back on the payroll and
teaching by mid-August,'' said Ms. Anderson. ``She's ready to go _
she's rarin' to go.''
   Craig Marsh, superintendent of schools for Nassau County, said
Tuesday he had not yet seen the decision and could not comment, but
understood that the county would have to provide the back pay. The
board, he said, would discuss the case next week.
   The Supreme Court ordered the May trial after it found Mrs.
Arline's TB fit the definition of disabilities included in a 1973
federal law forbidding discrimination against the handicapped.
   Mrs. Arline was fired in February 1979 from her job as a
third-grade teacher because she had contracted the disease.
   She filed suit, but a federal judge threw the case out in 1983.
Then in 1985, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
reinstated the case, saying a judge must determine whether her
firing was the result of medical necessity or unfounded hysteria
about the disease.
   Nassau County appealed the case to the Supreme Court. It argued
that a ruling in her favor would effectively make it impossible to
fire anyone with a contagious disease.
   Moore limited the back pay to four years because he found that
after 1983 Mrs. Arline had not made sufficient effort to find other
work or tried to qualify herself for teaching higher grades, which
the district would have allowed.

<HEAD>Church Of England Takes Another Step Toward Women Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church of England leaders voted Tuesday in favor
of proposals to admit women to the priesthood, despite opposition
from their spiritual head, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
who warned it could split the church.
   The General Synod of bishops, clergy and laity voted 299-216 for
draft legislation allowing the ordination of women. Each group
voted separately: the bishops voted 28-21 in favor; the clergy
voted 137-102; and the laity voted 134-93. There was one abstention.
   But a lengthy process must be followed before the Anglican state
church might get its first woman priest in 1992 or 1993.
   The legislation will be debated and voted upon by all 44 of the
church's dioceses. It then goes back to the General Synod for final
approval and must then by approved by Parliament.
   Runcie had no comment after the four-hour debate at Church House.
   Opponents of women priests estimate that at least 1,000 of the
10,660 clergy will leave the church if women are ordained. The
draft legislation allows for them to be paid up to $51,000 if they
quit on grounds of conscience.
   The legislation also allows bishops the right to refuse to
ordain women or have them in their dioceses.
   Runcie referred to the proposals as a ``legislative schism.'' He
said there was no consensus in the church for the historic step,
although the theological balance was now in favor.
   One prelate who voted for the proposals, Bishop of Peterborough
William Westwood, said later he thought the vote signaled the
``kiss of death'' for women's ordination.
   ``When it comes back to the synod in four years' time it will
need a two-thirds majority because it will be at a decisive stage.
It certainly didn't get that today and I detected a clear change of
mood among the bishops voting,'' Westwood said.
   ``Up to now they have been very much in favor. But their mood is
definitely changing because the church is getting tired of this
perpetual debate.''
   The issue was first debated 37 years ago but the first decisive
step was taken in 1975 when the synod said there were no
fundamental objections to women priests.
   Since then, Anglican churches in other countries _ which are
self-governing but look to the archbishop of Canterbury for
guidance _ have ordained about 1,000 women priests, most of them in
the U.S. Episcopalian Church.
   Runcie said he would continue to recognize women priests
ordained outside England and he would like to see them allowed to
exercise their ministry in England ``under special conditions,''
which he did not specify.
   Speakers in the debate were carefully selected to give equal
time to supporters and opponents.
   Archdeacon of the Royal Navy Noel Jones said: ``I appeal to the
synod not to take on board an issue which is so totally divisive.
Many people see us as a church limping along aimlessly _ are we now
hell-bent on shooting ourselves in the foot as well?''
   But the church's second-ranking prelate, Archbishop of York John
Habgood, said: ``We should allow the church at large a chance to
discuss this issue without giving a signal to the nation that we
are irrevocably committed to it.''

   The Iranian airliner shot down by a U.S. Navy
missile was transmitting information on two radio channels,
including one ``identified with F-14s'' flown by the Iranian air
force, the Pentagon said today.
   The fact the plane's transponder was using a military channel
helped lead to the conclusion aboard the cruiser Vincennes that the
ship was about to be attacked, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   That knowledge, Howard said, was a ``substantial factor'' in
Capt. Will C. Rogers III's decision to launch two missiles toward
the jet.
   ``The signals that the Vincennes were receiving were signals
previously identified with F-14s,'' Howard said.
   He said he was releasing the information about the transmission
on a military channel to support the statements of Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the
Vincennes fired its missiles because it throught it was attacking a
military target.
   Indeed, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, senior Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, told a Capitol Hill news
conference that giving a civilian plane a military transponder code
``defies all reasonable understanding.''
   However, Iran's U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati told
a news conference in New York today that contrary to assertions of
U.S. officials, the Iranian Airbus was sending out ``normal signals
... to all radar that it was a civilian plane.''
   Howard told reporters that there are still a large number of
unanswered questions about Sunday's incident, in which the Iranian
Airbus A-300 was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz.
   The Iranian plane, with 290 persons aboard, had just taken off
from Bandar Abbas, an airfield also used by Iranian military
planes, Howard noted.
   As the Iranian jetliner flew toward the Vincennes, the plane's
transponder was sending out signals through two channels, Howard
said. He identified them as ``mode 3'' and ``mode 2.''
   According to Howard, ``mode 3'' is a commonly used commercial
channel which is also sometimes used by military planes. Howard
said he did not specifically know what information the jetliner was
transmitting on ``mode 3.''
   But ``mode 2,'' according to Howard, ``is peculiar to military
aircraft.'' He said ``no commercial airlines use mode 2.''
   The ``mode 2'' transmitting device ``is a specific piece of
equipment that has to put on'' a plane, Howard said.
   The signals received by the Vincennes through ``mode 2'' had
been identified with Iranian F-14s in the past year, Howard said.
   Iran has a handful of U.S.-built F-14s that it purchased during
the reign of the shah. Some of the remaining F-14s were moved to
the Bandar Abbas airbase in recent days, according to Pentagon
officials.
   Howard also said there are ``conflicting reports'' about the
altitude and path of the Iranian plane before it was struck.
   Crowe had said the Iranian plane was at about 7,000 feet and was
descending directly toward the Vincennes when the order was given
to fire the ship's missiles.
   But the USS Sides, a frigate operating in the area at the same
time, reported that the airliner was above 12,000 feet. Asked if
the Sides' after-action report showed whether the plane was
descending or ascending, Howard said the report didn't indicate.

<HEAD>Missile Cruiser is a Lot of Ship for a `Lake in a Desert'</HEAD>

   The USS Vincennes, the first cruiser of
the high-tech Aegis type to serve in the Persian Gulf, is a lot of
ship for what an American skipper once called ``a lake in a
desert.''
   It was ordered here with such speed that some officers seemed to
have only a hazy idea of its mission. When the billion-dollar
warship entered the Persian Gulf on May 27, however, the night-time
passage through the narrow Strait of Hormuz left its 385 crewmen in
no doubt they were in a war zone.
   Off Oman, salvage tugs battled fire on a Norwegian ammonia
tanker attacked by Iranian gunboats the day before. On the Iranian
side, flames licked at ships still burning from an Iraqi air raid
on two weeks earlier on Iran's big Larak Island oil terminal.
   The assignment began in mid-April with a rush departure from
home port in San Diego.
   It is scheduled to last about three months, but the Vincennes
could be withdrawn earlier as a gesture to reduce tensions caused
by its shooting down of an Iranian airliner Sunday. U.S. officials
say the Airbus A300 was mistaken for an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Members of a Pentagon news pool taken aboard the ship before it
entered the gulf found some officers and crew somewhat puzzled over
the orders that brought them 13,000 miles in 32 days, on a million
gallons of fuel.
   Some officers noted it was the first tour in the narrow confines
of the gulf by one of the Navy's Aegis cruisers, which have
computer-linked radar and missile systems designed for fleet
defense in open sea.
   The shallow waterway, 600 miles long and no more than 120 miles
across for commercial shipping purposes, was described last year by
the captain of an older cruiser as ``a lake in a desert'' with many
threats, all close at hand.
   One officer of the Vincennes was asked what he thought the gulf
mission would be for a ship whose phased-array ``Spy'' radar and
weapons are designed to fight an enemy hundreds of miles away. He
replied: ``You tell me.''
   Even Capt. Will C. Rogers III, the skipper, seemed to have
trouble with the question, suggesting the multiple functions of his
supership might enable the Navy to reduce the strength of its gulf
force. That has not happened.
   Rogers told reporters the next day the Vincennes would provide
``a lot of battle management'' and ``maybe we will be able to
reduce the force level in the gulf and back away from the recent
tensions in the area.''
   Gen. George B. Crist told reporters in Manama on June 1 the
cruiser's air defense radar could cover the entire gulf and called
it a ``quantum leap forward'' in detering a new Iranian anti-ship
missile site nearing completion in the strait. The four-star Marine
genral heads the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., which is
responsible for the gulf.
   This is the fourth Navy ship named for the 1779 Revolutionary
War battle at what is now Vincennes, Ind., a university town on the
Wabash River. The first sailed around the world and a voyage in
1839 established that Antarctica was a land mass. The second and
third were World War II cruisers.
   The current Vincennes, launched at the Ingalls shipyard in
Pascagoula, Miss., three years ago Wednesday, is the third of 10
Aegis cruisers planned for the Navy.
   It originally was to be the USS Valley Forge but the name was
changed after a lobbying campaign by the Vincennes Association,
made up of veterans who served on the World War II cruisers,
Indiana politicians and Vincennes civic leaders.
   Cruiser No. 49 became the Vincennes and No. 50 got the name
Valley Forge.
   Since its arrival, the 567-foot warship has operated almost
exclusively in the soutehrn gulf, where air and surface activity is
most concentrated.

<HEAD>FDA Warns Against Misuse of Acne Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration cautioned
consumers Tuesday against indiscriminate use of the prescription
acne drug Retin-A to reduce wrinkles.
   While urging consumers to be prudent in obtaining the drug from
their dermatologists, the agency announced a crackdown on
unlicensed manufacturers it said have started to advertise and
distribute bogus drugs identified as Retin-A.
   ``Use of all these products amounts to an expensive therapeutic
gamble,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in a statement.
   Retin-A, manufactured by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan,
N.J., has long been approved to treated acne and normally is
applied to small areas of the skin for limited periods of time.
   However, the drug received nationwide attention earlier this
year when a research article published in a mainstream medical
journal suggested it could reduce or reverse wrinkling due to aging
and sun damage.
   Within days, dermatologists across the nation reported being
deluged by patients wanting to obtain the drug for wrinkle
reduction.
   ``Unfortunately, consumers have apparently accepted the reports
of this one small study as gospel and are willing to gamble with
Retin-A and imitation products sold through the mail or in
clinics,'' Young said.
   ``Even some dermatologists are jumping on the bandwagon by
offering `own label' products to their patients at exhorbitant
prices,'' he said.
   The FDA said it is actively investigating several companies
promoting and selling anti-wrinkle formulas and is initiating
regulatory action when warranted.
   The FDA said it is working with state authorities and the U.S.
Customs Service, Postal Service and the Federal Trade Commission to
curb the proliferation of illegal versions of Retin-A.
   As to physicians prescribing Retin-A for patients who want to
use it for wrinkle treatment, there is little the FDA can do at
this point except urge caution.
   If the agency determined such use was getting out of hand, it
could begin steps to change the labeling of the drug to
specifically warn against that kind of use and _ as a last resort _
move to have it withdrawn from the market.
   However, there was no indication any such actions are
contemplated.
   Instead, Young emphasized in the statement that Retin-A has been
approved only for treating acne and that there is no conclusive
evidence it reduces wrinkles.
   ``Long-term animal studies and well-controlled clinical trials
involving larger numbers of patients in various age groups are
needed to assess the risks and benefits of Retin-A as a wrinkle
reducer,'' Young said.

   The sister of an American held hostage in
Lebanon since 1985 said Tuesday she had been optimistic until the
U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian jetliner, prompting an unconfirmed
death threat against him.
   Peggy Say said she previously had been told that her brother,
Terry Anderson, might be released over the Fourth of July weekend,
but those hopes were dashed by Sunday's attack in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I had really high hopes when we came down here last week that
it would be over before anything like this could happen,'' she said
by telephone from her new home in western Kentucky.
   Her concern Tuesday, however, was over an unconfirmed threat
that Anderson, who was abducted March 16, 1985, in Beirut, Lebanon,
might be executed in revenge for the U.S. attack Sunday on the
jetliner carrying 290 people. There were no survivors.
   ``I'm trying to take some comfort in the fact that Islamic Jihad
has told us repeatedly that if a photograph does not accompany the
communication, then it's not official,'' Mrs. Say said.
   But she added, ``I am, of course, concerned.''
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held the longest of 18 foreign captives in Lebanon.
   An anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad, which
holds Anderson and American Thomas Sutherland, threatened to kill
one of them in retaliation for the attack.
   The caller did not elaborate, and it was not possible to
authenticate the call.
   Mrs. Say said she had mainly been thinking about two things
since the U.S. guided missile cruiser Vincennes destroyed the
jetliner.
   ``The grief the families of the victims are going through, and
Terry. I keep thinking about how terribly frightened he may be,''
she said.

   The U.S. flags flying on Main Street may
have been just too grand, and because of thieves they'll not be
high-flying on any more national holidays.
   Five were stolen over the Independence Day weekend, bringing the
total to 11 stolen in four years.
   ``We're just not going to put them up anymore,'' Mary Banks, who
has been in charge of the display since 21 flags were donated four
years ago, said Tuesday.
   ``People can't leave them alone for other people to enjoy,''
Mrs. Banks said.
   Mrs. Banks on Monday persuaded Odenville to offer a $200 reward
for information leading to the arrest of the flag thieves.
   ``I don't think they wanted them because they are patriotic,''
she said.
   Two years ago, Mayor James Moreland said, the town put up a
40-foot pole and a large flag in Odenville Park. ``In less than 30
minutes they had cut the rope and taken the flag ... in broad
daylight,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said Tuesday the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels mounted their biggest attack since
signing a cease-fire with the government three months ago. Five
soldiers and seven civilians died in the ambush, the ministry said.
   But Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales said he could not confirm or
deny report.
   ``I am seriously concerned about this campaign to create
incidents to justify whatever action against our units,'' he said
in an interview from his Miami office. He added that the rebels
have been ordered to fire only in self-defense.
   The leftist Sandinista government and Contra leaders on March 21
agreed to a truce and to seek a negotiated settlement to the nearly
7-year-old war.
   Newspapers quoted the Defense Ministry as saying the Contras on
Monday ambushed a Soviet-made jeep and a military truck full of
government troops and civilians.
   The reports said the rebels, using anti-tank mines, rifles and
grenade launchers, attacked the vehicles in the village of Buenos
Aires in central Chontales province, about 100 miles east of the
Managua.
   The Defense Ministry said 10 people _ two civilians and eight
soldiers _ also were wounded in the attack.
   A series of peace talks between high-level representatives of
the two sides broke off June 9. No new meetings have been scheduled.
   Both sides have extended the cease-fire, which ended June 30,
for another month. But they have been accusing each other of truce
violations.
   The Defense Ministry said Monday that in the month of June, the
Contras kidnapped 184 civilians, killed nine and wounded nine. It
also said 87 Contras were killed and 31 wounded. The ministry said
15 soldiers died and 62 were injured.
   The report also claimed there were violations of Nicaraguan air
space by U.S. Air Force reconnaissance flights and Contra supply
planes.
   The Contras, backed by the United States, have been battling the
government since 1981. More than 26,000 people were killed in the
war and the government estimates damages at $3.6 billion.
   The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 in a revolutionary
war that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-American
Somoza family. The Contra rebels claim the government leaders want
to install Marxism in their Central American nation.
   The Congress, which last approved U.S. aid to the rebels in
1986, in February rejected President Reagan's request for
additional military aid to the Contras.

Sunglasses''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, urging Americans to do ``a
little comparison shopping'' in the presidential race, praised
George Bush on Tuesday while accusing Michael Dukakis and the
Democrats of hiding liberalism behind ``political trench coats and
sunglasses.''
   In his strongest pitch yet for his vice president, Reagan called
Bush ``the kind of man I want to follow me.''
   The president, in an address to a group of conservatives at the
Old Executive Office Building, portrayed the November elections as
crucial for his conservative legacy.
   ``All we've achieved ... could be lost in just a few months,''
he said.
   Referring to the likely Democratic presidential nominee only as
``a governor,'' Reagan derided Dukakis as an ``out-and-out
liberal'' who has no interest in controlling government spending
and instead raises taxes.
   In contrast, Reagan lauded Bush as his standard-bearer for
conservative anti-tax, anti-abortion and tough law-and-order
policies.
   Less than two weeks before the Democrats gather in Atlanta for
their convention, Reagan accused the party of ``putting together a
campaign that is subtle and clever.''
   ``The American people understand what liberalism means and don't
like it, so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito _
they're putting on political trenchcoats and sunglasses,'' Reagan
said.
   Evoking laughter from his audience, Reagan quipped the Democrats
``will never even in the lowest whisper mumble the `L' word again.''
   ``How other than liberal would you characterize a governor who
in the last five years increased his state's spending twice as fast
as the federal government's and more than a third faster than the
average for all the other states?'' Reagan asked.
   ``And what do you call a governor who raises taxes $115 million
and declares it a victory? An out-and-out liberal,'' Reagan said.
   ``Yes, all that the American people need to do is a little
comparison shopping to see the truth,'' he added.
   Reagan said that while Dukakis ``has fought for weekend
furloughs for dangerous convicts, including drug dealers,'' Bush
``has led the fight against drug smugglers.''
   ``Their candidate has opposed requiring the Pledge of Allegiance
and allowing prayer in schools. Our candidate _ well, he and I both
find it hard to believe that anyone could take these positions,''
Reagan said.
   The president credited Bush with converting European
governmental officials who had opposed NATO's deployment of a new
generation of medium-range nuclear missiles _ the missiles that
have been ordered removed under the U.S.-Soviet arms treaty signed
by Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   After Bush's 1983 London speech advocating deployment, Reagan
contended, ``the tide in Europe shifted and thanks to him,
deployment went forward.''
   The bulk of Reagan's 15-minute address was devoted to extolling
Bush's virtues.
   ``It's no secret who I believe should pick up the lease around
here in January. Again and again these past eight years I've
admired George Bush's strength. Again and again his leadership has
been a key to our successes,'' Reagan said.
   ``Yes, this is the kind of man I want to follow me, someone who
will take our battle forward, who will speak our gospel truly and
will do the work that is yet to be done,'' Reagan said.

   Willie B., Zoo Atlanta's famous gorilla,
celebrated his 30th birthday with a big basket of fruit, while the
guests higher up the evolutionary ladder enjoyed what was billed as
the world's largest banana split.
   About 500 people jammed the viewing area opposite Willie B.'s
new outdoor habitat at the zoo's African rain forest to wish the
459-pound lowland gorilla a happy birthday Monday. The date was
arbitrary, since Willie was captured in the wild.
   While the people had ice cream, Willie B. downed five bananas
for starters, dropping the peels carefully in front of him, then
gobbled a few clusters of red grapes, followed by an apple and a
couple of handfuls of strawberries.
   Willie B. savored a moment of applause, then downed a couple of
cantaloupes and a cluster of green grapes, one grape at a time.
Then, he shredded the basket.

   An enterprising ape propped a tree limb
against a wall and climbed over to join startled visitors at the
Kansas City Zoo.
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' said Karen Maness, who walked
out of the restroom Sunday to see the 200-pound gorilla running
toward her family. ``I didn't know whether he was going to attack
them.''
   The gorilla avoided the family, went around the camel and wooly
monkey exhibits and ambled back to the Ape House, where she was
caught about five minutes later.
   ``The other gorillas were screeching,'' Mrs. Maness said. ``They
knew something was happening that shouldn't be.''
   The gorilla was eating bark from the tree limb when she propped
it against the wall, said Gene Tryon, manager of public services at
the zoo.
   Mrs. Maness said zoo officials tried to route visitors to safe
places until the gorilla could be caught and tranquilized with a
dart gun. About 8,000 people were at the zoo.
   Tyron said gorillas, which are naturally shy and timid, have
been fed tree bark for years at the zoo. He said the zoo will make
sure branches will be escape-proof in the future.
   ``We've never had a gorilla loose in the zoo before,'' Tryon
said.

   Jeff Harris bills himself as the biggest
small-business man in town, but it isn't just his 400-pound frame
that's unusual.
   Harris, a vegetarian, runs a hot dog stand.
   ``Most folks don't know about my vegetarianism,' Harris said
recently. ``When they hear about it, some even doubt that a
400-pound man who runs a hot dog shop doesn't get into the
inventory.
   ``Sometimes I'll grab a bun and go into the kitchen and put some
cheese and relish on it and eat that so people will think I'm
eating hot dogs, but actually I'm not.''
   His vegetarian beliefs began in 1971 when he was in the fifth
grade.
   ``I was a very religious little person,'' he said. ``The church
I was going to said there are clean and unclean types of meat. So I
thought I'd be better off not trying any of them. I've been a
vegetarian ever since.''
   He said he has never tried his own hot dogs or chili and said
his employees test the food for him.

   Rep. Jim Moody may drop his bid for the
Democratic Senate nomination because of the recent entry into the
race of millionaire Herbert Kohl, aides to the congressman said
Tuesday.
   ``The options are simple: continue the Senate campaign or seek
re-election to the House of Representatives,'' said Michael
Elconin, Moody's campaign manager.
   Moody was unavailable for comment, but Elconin said the
candidate was contacting ``hundreds'' of his supporters and
advisers to help in the decision, which would be announced
Wednesday at the earliest.
   Kohl, the multimillionaire owner of the Milwaukee Bucks of the
National Basketball Association, has risen to second place in the
Democratic Senate race after a month of heavy television
campaigning, a Milwaukee Journal poll showed.
   The survey published Sunday showed Moody trailed former Gov.
Anthony Earl and Kohl in the September primary race and was tied
with Edward Garvey for third place. Wisconsin Secretary of State
Douglas LaFollette was in fourth.
   The candidates are trying to win the seat being vacated by
Democratic Sen. William Proxmire, who announced last year he would
retire.
   If Moody decides to seek re-election to his 5th District seat,
he must file by July 12.

   A can of state-grown popcorn with the words
``Georgia's Popping'' will greet each delegate to the Democratic
National Convention in an effort by the Georgia Tourist Division to
lure conventioneers outside Atlanta to some of the state's other
cities.
   Delegates driving to Atlanta can also obtain brochures
suggesting possible routes and statewide points of interest.
   The idea is to let other cities share the spotlight _ and a
share of the dollars to be spent by delegates and others attending
the July 18-21 convention.
   On top of more than 5,400 delegates descending on the state,
Georgia cities will be courting about 15,000 members of the press
attending the convention.
   Marietta, Warm Springs, Gainesville and Roswell are all offering
tours from the convention area to their communities. Several other
cities will have delegation parties the Sunday before the
convention begins.
   ``If we could get three or four press people, we will have done
what we wanted to accomplish,'' said Janice Marshall, executive
director of the Macon Convention and Visitors Bureau.

fatally shot a ship paymaster and stole the $94,000 payroll.
   A Navy judge Tuesday cleared the way for trial by rejecting
defense challenges to search warrants in the case.
   The warrants, for three bank safety-deposit boxes, ``were
properly issued'' despite wrong dates and other erroneous
information supplied to the issuing judge by Naval investigators,
Judge John A. Studer ruled.
   The selection of a court-martial jury of at least five Navy
officers was scheduled Wednesday, and opening statements were
expected Thursday in the trial of Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben
Colon, 34, of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.
   Colon is accused of killing Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad, 24,
disbursing officer aboard the destroyer John Hancock, while it was
docked at Mayport, last March 15. He is charged with murder,
kidnapping, robbery and receiving stolen property.
   According to court records, Prasad was taken at gunpoint from
his office to a lower deck, where he was bound, shot dead and
stuffed in a locker.
   The judge had earlier refused to rule out the death penalty as a
possible punishment for the murder charge. But the Navy has not
executed anyone since a mutiny in 1849.
   Colon's lawyer, Lt. Matthew J. Michels, argued Tuesday that the
affidavit in support of a request for the search warrants was
``carelessly prepared'' and then ``negligently reviewed'' by
federal Magistrate Harvey Schlesinger.
   But Schlesinger testified that conflicting dates about the
criminal activity and resulting investigation ``don't mean
anything'' because they had no bearing on the crime itself, or
Colon's alleged role in it.
   The prosecutor, Lt. Daniel J. Glary, contended the errors and
inconsistencies had ``no bearing on probable cause'' of guilt and
the justification for a search of Colon's safety deposit boxes.
   The judge agreed.
   The break in the case came when the bank that rented Colon the
largest safety deposit box available tipped off investigators.
   The court-martial is being held in a windowless classroom at the
Fleet Trainer Center at Mayport. About 10 members of the
destroyer's crew have been flown from the Middle East to testify.

   West Virginia farmers should not donate
their hay crop to drought-stricken Midwest farmers but should sell
it instead, Preston County's extension agent said Tuesday.
   ``We have the hay those guys need,'' said Tom McConnell. ``We
shouldn't feel guilty at all about sending hay to the Midwest _ to
sell.''
   McConnell was responding to appeals from state agricultural
officials attempting to organize a hay giveaway program similar to
one conducted by Virginia farmers.
   ``When corn is in short supply here no one is sending corn to
us, and the price goes up,'' McConnell said.
   McConnell said the first cutting of hay in Preston County has
been good, but the continued drought has been hurting grass hay.
Deep-rooted alfalfa is doing fine.
   The extension agent said he has been receiving calls from Ohio
farmers wanting to buy hay.
   The price of hay in Preston County is 50 cents per bale higher
than this time last year and is rising, McConnell said. It normally
costs about $1.00 to $1.25 a bale.

   Nothing was left of Nothing on Tuesday
after a fire swept through this tiny desert community, destroying
its only business and the trailer homes of its four permanent
residents.
   The combination grocery store and service station in Nothing,
about 100 miles northwest of Phoenix, had been a popular stop for
travelers on U.S. 93, the main route between Phoenix and Las Vegas,
Nev.
   ``People would stop there, have a pop and kick back for a while,
because it is just about the only thing between Wickenburg and
Wikieup,'' Jim Bell, a firefighter with the Hualapai Valley Fire
Department, said Tuesday. The two towns are about 75 miles apart on
the highway.
   ``I guess they won't be stopping anymore because there's nothing
left in Nothing.''
   The cause of the Monday afternoon fire remained under
investigation, Bell said in a telephone interview.
   ``It started in one of the trailers, spread to the store and gas
station and to the other trailer,'' Bell said. The blaze also
touched off about a 10-acre brush fire, he added.
   Bell said his department, which is based in Kingman, 75 miles
northwest of Nothing, sent two units to the fire after being
notified shortly after 4 p.m. Monday.
   When the units arrived at 5:45 p.m., there was little they could
do to save the town, but they were able to help an elderly couple
who refused to leave a small trailer they were staying in, Bell
said.
   ``They made a stand, so we had to make a stand. We dedicated one
truck to keeping the fire away from their trailer,'' he said.
``They were lucky.''
   Bell said the couple, whose names he did not know, were the only
people left in Nothing Tuesday, and their trailer was the only
structure standing.
   There were no injuries in the fire, he said.
   In addition to the store and the trailers of the permanent
residents, about a dozen vehicles were destroyed by the fire, Bell
said. He estimated the damage at about $100,000.

   The only hospital in Beirut's besieged
Bourg el-Barajneh refugee camp was bombarded in fighting between
Palestinian militias in southern slums that killed seven people and
wounded 24, police said.
   The attack on the hospital by Syrian-backed fighters of Col.
Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising faction forced its only surgeon and
some of the medical staff to flee, police said.
   Tuesday's duels between Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah fighters and Col. Mousa's
dissident guerrillas raised the casualty toll to 158 killed and 618
wounded since the battle for control of the camps in south Beirut
broke out May 1.
   An average of five shells a minute rained on Bourj el-Barajneh
on Tuesday. Thick clouds of smoke billowed from the shantytown as
Mousa's gunners, entrenched in Syrian-controlled hills above
Beirut, opened up with artillery, mortars and rockets.
   The fighting flared Monday, shattering a lull after the fall of
the nearby Chatilla camp to Mousa's men on June 27.
   Police said 35 mortar rounds hit the four-story Haifa Hospital
on Tuesday. The only surgeon in the camp, two nurses and a general
practioner left the shantytown around noon, during a short break in
the fighting.

   The Pentagon said the Vincennes captain decided to fire on the

   American military sources in the Gulf said at least two other

<TEXT>
   Organized labor, declining this year to repeat
its early presidential endorsement of 1984, will have nearly one of
every four delegates at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta.
   Preliminary totals from the 90-union AFL-CIO and the independent
National Education Association show a record 1,003 or 24 percent of
the convention's 4,161 delegates coming from the ranks of the labor
movement.
   In 1984, the two groups, which represent about 17 million
workers, had 901 or 22.9 percent of the 3,933 delegates at the
Democratic convention in San Francisco.
   As of Tuesday, the AFL-CIO said it has 723 union members or
officials on the roster of delegates for this year's convention,
including 42 ``super delegates'' who hold seats on the 392-member
Democratic National Committee.
   ``We're expecting maybe five more,'' said Lorrie McHugh, a
spokeswomen for the federation.
   Four years ago when its early endorsement of Walter Mondale
earned labor the tag ``special interest'' from Mondale's primary
opponents, the federation had a total of 642 delegates at the San
Francisco convention.
   When exit polls from the November election showed that between
43 percent and 47 percent of voters from union households cast
their ballots for Ronald Reagan, critics contended that labor
leaders were out of touch with their members.
   Determined to avoid a repeat of that criticism and in response
to pleas from Democratic leaders, the AFL-CIO agreed to forgo an
endorsement until after the primaries this year or when internal
union polls showed one candidate emerging with at least two-thirds
support.
   A breakdown of the delegates shows that two-thirds consensus has
yet to emerge.
   Despite having already wrapped up the nomination, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis has only 56.4 percent of the AFL-CIO delegates
to the convention. Jesse Jackson has 26.6 percent.
   The others are divided among former candidates _ Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Paul
Simon of Illinois _ or are undecided.
   Without the early endorsement, most union political activists
had expected to carry fewer delegates into the convention this year
than in 1984.
   ``There is genuine surprise within labor at how well we've
done,'' said Allen Zack, a spokesman for the one-million-member
United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which will have 23
delegates at the convention.
   Lacking a single candidate to back, the AFL-CIO launched a
``Democracy at Work'' campaign 14 months ago aimed at getting union
members to the convention on any candidate's slate.
   It included submitting questions to the candidates, videotaping
all of them and submitting about 15,000 copies of the tape to be
shown in 57,000 local union halls across the country.
   In addition, the federation's Committee on Political Education
sent teams into those union halls explaining to rank-and-file
workers how to get commitments from the presidential candidates to
slate them as delegates in the state caucuses and primaries.
   ``The assumption that the labor movement would come out on the
short end of the stick, sans endorsement, was wrong all along,''
said Peter Laarman of the United Auto Workers. ``Plus, nobody has
raised that nonsense about us being a special interest this time.
That's another dividend of the process.''
   Laarman said the UAW will have 101 delegates at the Atlanta
convention compared with 82 at San Francisco four years ago. The
only union delegations larger are the NEA's at 280 and the American
Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, with 159
delegates.
   Not everyone fared so well. The United Steel Workers, for
example, will go to Atlanta with just 40 delegates this year
compared with 61 convention delegates four years ago.
   Unions believe the point they made with the size of their
delegation was worth the effort.
   ``The idea was to make clear in a way that was not offensive or
counterproductive _ but simply a reflection of reality _ that labor
is part of the process,'' said the UAW's Laarman.
   ``Without getting working people and their families back in the
Democratic fold in large numbers,'' Laarman said, ``the return of
the Democrats may not take place.''

<DATELINE>DECATUR, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While most communities named Decatur are
gearing up to help the needy, officials in this parched town say
they may be having to ask for aid.
   Organizers in Decatur, Ill. _ the nation's largest Decatur with
94,000 residents _ had challenged other U.S. Decaturs to collect
one can of food per citizen to help the needy.
   The mayor of Nebraska's Decatur accepted the challenge and
joined ``Cans Across the County,'' but now he doesn't think he will
be able to approach his citizens to ask for help.
   This northeastern Nebraska village is entirely dependent on the
farm economy and for the last 22 days has received little rain,
said Mayor Jack Maryott.
   ``We've got no factories or anything here,'' he said. ``If we
don't have a crop here, it's bad, and it doesn't look good for us
right now.''
   There is a ``90 percent chance'' the town will bow out of the
competition unless rain falls soon, Maryott said Monday.
   Organizers in Illinois were hoping the drought doesn't force
other Decaturs to withdraw from the challenge, which could provide
hundreds of thousands of cans of food for the poor.
   Mayor Gary Anderson of Decatur, Ill., kicked off the contest on
Memorial Day weekend by mailing a white glove to each of the other
Decaturs _ officials believe there are 28.
   Part of the idea was to answer the question posed on T-shirts
being handed out in Illinois, ``Where the heck's Decatur?''

   Soviet officials fanned out across
West Germany on Tuesday to inspect U.S. nuclear missile sites
covered by the superpower arms treaty.
   The 19 Soviet specialists, who arrived Monday, split up into two
teams and traveled to a U.S. Pershing II missile site in Mutlangen
near Stuttgart and a cruise missile site at Hasselbach south of
Koblenz, said an Air Force spokesman at the Rhein-Main U.S. Air
Force Base near Frankfurt.
   ``They have up to 24 hours to complete their inspections. Should
there be a reason for further inspections and both sides agree, an
additional eight hours can be permitted,'' said the spokesman.
   The inspections are being conducted under the new superpower
arms treaty, in which the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
to scrap their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   American inspectors have gone to the Soviet Union to examine
intermediate-range nuclear missile sites there, while other Soviet
specialists are checking sites in the United States.
   The U.S. Air Force spokesman at Rhein-Main said he did not know
how long it would take for the Soviet teams in West Germany to
check the two missile sites they were visiting Tuesday.
   ``Because of time constraints under the treaty, it is reasonable
to expect they will approach their duties in an expeditious
manner,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``There are rest facilities for them at the sites, and a place
for them to take a nap if they choose. There are also private
meeting rooms where they can discuss their inspection activities,''
said the official.
   There are four other U.S. sites in West Germany that fall under
the superpower arms treaty. The Soviets have not yet announced
whether they will be visiting those sites as well, the spokesman
said.
   The inspections in West Germany, the United States and the
Soviet Union are to make sure that items found at the missile sites
correspond to what has been listed by the superpowers in the treaty.

   He can't type and his editors rewrote his
lead, but Gov. Mario Cuomo said playing cub reporter for a day
Tuesday was fun and taught him it's not easy getting all the facts.
   The governor, to fulfill a promise made during his last
campaign, worked for a day for the Jamestown Post-Journal. He was
assigned to cover Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine presenting a check to help
build a research center.
   Here's what Cuomo wrote:
   ``A local boy who made good came back to Jamestown yesterday and
demonstrated the economic development skills that earned him and
the city a national reputation when he was Jamestown's mayor from
1970 to March 1976.
   ``Stan Lundine, now lieutenant governor, presented the
Blackstone Corp. with a symbolic check for $4 million, under an
agreement with Blackstone that will keep the 1,000 jobs it now
creates, and at least 35 and probably many more.''
   Here's the edited version:
   ``A symbolic $4 million check was given to Blackstone yesterday
to preserve 1,000 jobs and create at least 35 more.''
   Cuomo said later the story was hard to humanize because ``there
was no sex in this thing.''
   ``I'll know print press better now, the difficulty of it,''
Cuomo said. ``Getting all the salient facts down when people are up
on that stage talking a mile a minute and you don't have time to
hear it all back on the recorder.''
   On a flight from Jamestown back to Albany, Cuomo told Lundine,
``It looks different from down there (with the reporters).''
   After a news conference at Blackstone, Cuomo returned to the
newspaper and began writing his story as dozens of visiting
reporters and Post-Journal employees watched.
   It wasn't quite like real life. For one thing, there was the
matter of typing. For another, there was the deadline.
   Cuomo, who doesn't know how to type, reviewed his notes and then
summoned another reporter to type the story while he dictated.
   Cuomo, with reporter Manley Anderson's help, needed about 45
minutes to finish his story, to be published under his byline
Wednesday in the Post-Journal, an afternoon newspaper with a
circulation of 29,000.
   Unlike most reporters covering a late-morning event for an
afternoon newspaper, Cuomo was not required to file his story for
Tuesday's editions.
   Post-Journal editor Cristie Herbst briefly conferred with Cuomo
when he returned to the newsroom.
   ``He came up with the lead himself. I maybe had to refine it a
little,'' Herbst said.
   Anderson said Cuomo would ``be near the top'' as far as cub
reporters go.
   ``He seems to have a fair idea of what it's all about,''
Anderson said.
   The governor, who has published two diaries about his public
life, agreed to work as a reporter after a Post-Journal columnist
issued a challenge when Cuomo severely criticized coverage of his
1986 re-election campaign.
   ``It's fun,'' Cuomo said. ``I'd like to do more of it. I won't,
but I'd like to do more of it.''
   During the news conference, Cuomo attracted most of the
attention of reporters and television crews.
   Cuomo quizzed Lundine and company executives about a state
assistance program and whether it would actually help save 1,000
jobs as Lundine and the officials claimed.
   The grant, from the state Department of Economic Development
which Cuomo oversees, is designed to help Blackstone develop new
cooling systems for automobiles.
   ``How can you assure us that it wouldn't have happened without
taxpayer assistance?'' Cuomo asked. But the mild-mannered Lundine
assured his boss that Blackstone proved it needed the money to make
sure it got the project.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force charged with assessing safety in
NASA said Tuesday that attitudes in the space agency have improved
but ``there is still a lack of talent'' to assure accident-free
flights after the first post-Challenger shuttle mission in
September.
   The committee, in a report issued Tuesday, said it found no
significant safety issues to stand in the way of the Discovery
flight, but that there still were ``deficiencies in people, skills,
management systems and independent safety oversight functions.''
   The report card on safety, requested by a House subcommittee
that oversees space flight, was made public a day after Discovery
was rolled out to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   ``The new launch decision management system is thorough and
provides for a healthy redundancy of safety reviews and
oversights,'' the committee said, and by proper use of the new
systems ``the safety concerns for the next flight should be
adequately addressed.''
   In August last year, the same committee _ composed of people
within and outside of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration _ was critical of NASA operations, saying that
safety concerns had given way to business as usual, and ``an
alarming vacillation in safety emphasis and management.''
   Since then, says the new study, some of the most talented NASA
engineers and managers have been transferred into top management
positions in NASA's safety organizations. Many of them, the report
noted, will transfer back to their primary jobs after the Discovery
flight.
   ``There is still some concern that the depth of experienced,
skilled and competent people is too shallow,'' the report said.
``After the first-line safety organization management, there is
still a lack of talent. This should improve with time, as employees
learn by example and from the new managers.''
   The committee recommended formalized training and rotation of
people to and from safety organizations and other programs.
   It noted that safety issues and identifying hazards and controls
on the manned space flight program had been given highest priority
in the activities to return to flight.
   But, it said, ``the question of how to continue the safety
effort'' after the Discovery flight worried many NASA managers.
   ``It is certain that the level of effort exihibited in the
respite between launches cannot be maintained,'' the panel said.
``An ongoing system must be set up.''
   In its 1987 report, the committee said the concern for safety,
which peaked shortly after the Challenger exploded in January 1986,
``appears to be waning.''
   But now, the committee said, ``the present healthy concern for
safety is in evidence at all organizations ... there appears to be
universal personal commitment to providing a safe flight for
STS-26.''
   When President Reagan issued a new National Space Policy earlier
this year, the report said, ``the commitment to safety was not
emphasized.''
   The committee was co-chaired by Charles W. Mertz of NASA
headquarters and Joyce A. McDevitt, a private consultant.

<TEXT>
   Indiana will begin a water locater service
to help find emergency supplies for farmers whose livestock is
endangered by the drought, a committee of state agency heads was
told Tuesday.
   Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, Indiana's commissioner of agriculture and
chairman of the drought advisory committee, said some farmers in
southern Indiana already must haul water to their livestock because
their own supplies are exhausted.
   State agencies will try to locate water supplies and possibly
arrange to move the herds to the water, which could be less
expensive than moving the water to the livestock.
   The state already has developed a hay locater service to find
feed for livestock herds. Last week a shipment of hay was received
from South Carolina and this week hay is expected from Virginia,
officials said.
   In other activity today, the committee was informed that a
prolonged drought eventually could cut public utilities' ability to
meet demand for electricity.
   ``As the drought continues and temperatures rise, the increased
demand for electricity and the decreased generation capability
could eventually lead to a shortfall of electricity,'' said Robert
D. Glazier, director of utilities for the Utility Regulatory
Commission.
   Glazier said most coal-fired electric generating plants use
water in the cooling process. Plants on large bodies of water such
as Lake Michigan and the Ohio River should have few problems, but
generators on smaller waterways might have to cut back if the
drought persists, he said.
   He said the problem has two components: Drought cuts the amount
of water available and the discharge of heated water from the plant
could violate environmental standards when the streams or rivers
receiving the water are low.
   ``Our preliminary assessment is that, in the short-term, the
effect of the drought on the generation of electricity will be
minimal,'' said Glazier. ``However, the consumer may see higher
electricity costs due to the purchase of more expensive power or
the extended use of extensive peaking capacity.
   ``If the drought continues and there are high temperatures,
electricity use may have to be curtailed,'' said Glazier.

<HEAD>New York Telephone Reacts to Suffolk VDT Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing Suffolk County's new VDT bill, New York
Telephone announced Tuesday a hiring freeze on VDT jobs in the
county and said it would close a directory assistance bureau there
that employs about 125 persons.
   Thomas Calabrese, general manager, said in a statement that the
company regrets the decision but that the VDT bill ``imposes
unnecessary costs'' that will eventually be passed on to customers.
   He said the VDT-equipped Babylon directory assistance office
will close when its lease expires Dec. 31 and the company will
review other leases on a case-by-case basis. Babylon employees will
be reassigned to other locations.
   The VDT bill, which is the first of its kind in the nation,
requires businesses with 20 or more terminals to meet safety
standards, such as non-glare screens and rest breaks.
   The Suffolk County Legislature passed the law June 14,
overriding a veto of the measure by County Executive Patrick Halpin.
   The bill was opposed by local business groups who said they
feared the county would lose 3,000 jobs.
   Valerie Scibilia, spokeswoman for the Long Island Association,
which plans to file a suit challenging the law later this week
said, ``It should really not be a surprise that New York Telephone
did this because they said they would consider doing it if the bill
became law.''
   Scibilia said, ``it's a unique law that singles out Suffolk
County and we feel the legislature has exceeded its authority.''
   Greg Blasso, who cosponsored the bill said, ``to blame it on the
VDT bill is to indulge in overreaction _ the telephone company
should understand that the bill is reasonable.... is it a burden to
provide detachable key boards and proper lighting?''
   According to Blasso, the telephone company has nothing to worry
about until after l990, because ``the only thing they are required
to do now is provide eye examinations and pay for 80 percent of the
cost for corrective glasses if needed.
   Halpin said in a statement, ``I think it is unfortunate that New
York Telephone Co. has made this decision because I think Suffolk
workers are among the finest in the region and the major reason why
businesses and industries of all types have chosen to locate here.''

<HEAD>Satellite News Service To Provide Additional Convention Coverage</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The television networks may be content to
carry a mere two hours of Democratic convention coverage a night,
but party officials are betting that local stations will want more
_ and they'll happily supply it.
   The Convention Satellite News Service will begin 46 hours of
transmissions July 16, two days before the Democrats open their
parley in Atlanta's Omni arena.
   Manager Paul Byers said the material, available to any
television station with a satellite dish, will include packaged
interviews with party officials, live coverage of convention
proceedings, both on and off the floor, and opportunities for local
stations to interview area politicians attending the convention.
   Four mobile crews in Atlanta will cover newsworthy events, Byers
said. He said former CBS newsman Ike Pappas was hired to conduct
advance interviews with party chairman Paul G. Kirk and convention
chairman Don Fowler.
   A plethora of Democratic groups _ the national committee, the
convention committee, the House and Senate campaign committees,
mayors, governors and state chairmen _ have been allocated
satellite time and are preparing video packages that range from a
look at labor issues to an interview with House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas.
   Wright, presiding over the convention as a House panel
investigates some of his financial dealings and other matters, was
interviewed in a segment prepared by the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   Asked whether it is wise under the circumstances for the
Democrats to showcase Wright on their satellite, Byers replied,
``Wright is playing the leading role in the convention. Hopefully
the interview has some teeth in it _ asks the questions that any
journalist would ask.''
   Convention Satellite News Service originally planned to offer 38
hours of transmissions, Byers said, but added another eight hours
``based on feedback from the stations that they wanted it.''
   During the four-day convention the service will beam live and
taped material from 2 p.m. to midnight. All stations, including
about 330 that will be represented in Atlanta, are being encouraged
to use it.
   CBS and NBC have said they will carry convention coverage from 9
to 11 p.m. the first three nights and 8 to 11 p.m. on the final
night. ABC has similar plans.
   ``We're not trying to compete with the networks or other news
coverage. We're seeking to supplement, not supplant,'' Byers said.
   One of the primary functions of the satellite feed will be to
enable local news people to interview congressmen, senators and
others for their own audiences. Stations also will be offered
footage of the arena for use in advance pieces and live events they
can excerpt to fit their own needs.
   ``We want them to maintain editorial control. That's the
difference between this and a press release,'' said Byers. ``There
are always risks, but you take those risks and hope that the net
effect is positive.''

<HEAD>INF Treaty Verification Teams To Return To U.S.S.R.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teams of Soviet inspectors
left for home Tuesday after inspecting five U.S. missile facilities
to verify compliance with the historic Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty.
   The 48 weapons experts and linguists boarded their IL-62
Aeroflot jetliner and left about noon, one day after conducting
24-hour spot checks at missile plants in Utah, Arizona, Colorado
and California, said Capt. Tom Dolney, spokesman at Travis.
   They returned to the base late Sunday and early Monday in time
for a July Fourth air and fireworks show. ``They couldn't help but
see it,'' Dolney said.
   ``They rested up when they got here because they went pretty
hard during their inspections,'' he said. ``There was so much to do
and so little time to do it in.''
   The inspectors conducted the first of five types of inspections
allowed under the INF treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in December.
   The ``baseline inspection'' is designed to verify the exact
number of medium-range missiles and related components to be
destroyed under the treaty.
   ``It's basically to count and record,'' said Lt. Col. Joseph
Wagovich of the Department of Defense's new On-Site Inspection
Agency.
   Another 22 inspectors who arrived with the five teams will
remain up to 13 years at the Hercules Aerospace Co. missile plant
in Magna, Utah, to monitor the gates of the facility where Pershing
missile rocket motors were made.
   The Soviets had arrived Friday as 20 American inspectors
departed for Moscow and the Soviet city of Votkinsk for reciprocal
inspections.
   Friday marked the first of 60 days allowed under the treaty for
24-hour spot checks at designated missile facilities in the U.S and
Western Europe and the Soviet Union, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
   Armed with tape measures, scales and Polaroid cameras, the
Soviets visited five sites: the Pueblo Army Depot Activity in
Pueblo, Colo.; a General Dynamics plant in San Diego, Calif.; the
Dugway Proving Ground, a remote Army installation in the Western
Utah desert; a cruise missile testing and training site at Fort
Huachuca, Ariz., about 60 miles south of Tucson; and Davis-Monthan
Air Force base near Tucson, a missile training center.
   Under the complex provisions of the treaty, the Soviets had the
right to conduct spot checks at any of the five sites this weekend,
and they didn't have to say how many of them they wanted to visit
until the last minute.

<HEAD>Golf Courses Hurt, Golfers Helped By Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   The drought may be reducing the number of golf swings taken in
America.
   The heat is driving some hackers off the course, and those who
are playing in drought-stricken areas are getting more bounce out
of their drives and facing fewer hazards on dry fairways.
   ``The ground is real hard. The greens are watered but they're a
little brown. We have watered the fairways but it hasn't done any
good. They're still burnt out,'' said Eddie Tyree, head
professional at the par-72, 6,517-yard Seneca Golf Course in
Louisville, Ky.
   ``It helps the golfers, though. They get more roll on the
ball,'' he added.
   At the Willow Creek public golf course in Des Moines, grounds
crews are struggling to stretch limited water supplies to keep
greens from drying up.
   ``We're watering like crazy,'' said Joe Pfiffner, assistant
greens superintendent, who estimates ponds on the course have
enough water for another month of irrigation. The soil is hard and
``the ball rolls a long way now,'' he said.
   At the private Burlington Golf Club in Burlington, Iowa,
superintendent Jim Holtschult has added three employees to help
with watering.
   The course has no sprinklers and crews water by hand,
concentrating on areas exposed to wind, such as mounds. Holtschult
said his crews try to match the evaporation rate, but fist-sized
brown spots are cropping up.
   Low humidity has kept turf diseases in check despite the heat,
but Holtshult said hot and humid conditions could spread disease
rapidly.
   Richard Haskell, executive director of the Massachusetts Golf
Association, said there were no problems yet in his state, but the
situation in the Midwest had raised consciousnesses.
   ``The superintendents (in Massachusetts) are very aware of it
and they're starting to practice conservation,'' he said.
   At Louisville's most popular public course, afternoon play is
down 10 percent to 12 percent, Tyree said.
   ``Morning play is still real good because people want to beat
the heat,'' he said. He added that the drought had dried up a
hazard.
   ``We've got a creek here on the course and it's dried up, so
there isn't any hazard anymore,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hecht Files for Re-election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Chic Hecht filed for a
second term Tuesday, criticizing Democratic challenger Dick Bryan
for a ``campaign of deception.''
   Hecht also termed Iranians ``a bunch of religious fanatics''
when asked to comment on the shooting down of an Iranian passenger
jet carrying 290 people.
   The incumbent, an upset winner six years ago, also said he was
agreeable to debates or debate-type forums with Gov. Bryan and that
while nothing is scheduled before the end of August ``I'm ready if
something comes up.''
   In filing for Senate last week, Bryan accused Hecht of stalling
a debate, of being ineffective and too far to the political right,
and trying to buy re-election with a warchest of up to $5 million.
   Hecht said Bryan was wrong on the $5 million in campaign funds
and the amount was closer to $2.5 million or $3 million, about the
same amount Bryan figures on spending. He also said Bryan was
getting desperate and ``swinging wildly.''
   Asked whether the United State should pay damages for the
shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet by a Navy warship in the
Persian Gulf, Hecht said he wanted to study the issue first. He
also said he had no second thoughts about his vote earlier this
year against reparations to U.S. Japanese held in camps in this
country during World War II.
   Referring to the Iranian situation, Hecht said, ``We're dealing
with a bunch of religious fanatics over there who feel if they can
kill an American that's their passport to heaven.''
   Hecht has trailed Bryan in several polls taken earlier this year
and last year. But in filing he said a new GOP poll shows him
``virtually in a dead heat'' with Bryan and with the lion's share
of voters over 45 years old.

   More than 460 people died on the nation's
roadways during the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
   At least 463 people were reported killed in traffic accidents
over the three-day period, according to authorities in all 50
states.
   Before the holiday began, the Chicago-based National Safety
Council had estimated that between 400 and 500 people could die in
holiday traffic accidents. The council said 400 traffic deaths
might be expected during a three-day, non-holiday period at this
time of year.
   California reported the highest state toll with 57 dead,
followed by Texas with 31 and Florida with 27.
   Five states _ Alaska, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming _
reported no traffic fatalities.
   For counting purposes, the weekend began at 6 p.m. Friday and
ended at midnight, local times, Monday.
   During last year's Independence Day weekend, 390 people were
killed.
   The highest toll on record for a three-day Fourth of July
weekend was logged in 1971, when 638 people died.

   Aldridge and his wife left Moscow for Houston, while the rest of
the party remained in the Soviet Union to complete the itinerary.
   The acting head of the delegation is Lt. Gen. Donald L. Cromer,
commander of the space division of the Air Force, the Pentagon said.
   The Air Force delegation left the United States last Friday,

<HEAD>Sihanouk Supports Talks Among Factions, But Sees No Easy Solution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk said Tuesday he supports plans for informal talks
among the warring factions in his country, but sees no easy
solution to the conflict.
   Sihanouk told foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations that the talks, scheduled for July 25 in Indonesia,
marked a turning point in the search for a peace settlement.
   But he pointed to the negative outcome of meetings he held last
winter with Prime Minister Hun Sen, head of the Vietnam-backed
communist Cambodian government.
   Sihanouk warned: ``Don't expect that (the informal meeting) is
going to be easy and that it will reach a constructive
conclusion,'' Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Saroj Chavanaviraj
told reporters.
   Discussions of the Cambodian issue dominated the ASEAN annual
conference in Bangkok, which concluded Tuesday. Ministers expressed
optimism that the informal talks will lead to a peace accord
between Cambodian resistance groups and Vietnam, which invaded
Cambodia in late 1978.
   Vietnam on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for the informal talks.
   A July 29, 1987, Vietnamese-Indonesian agreement calls for
two-stage discussions, with Vietnam, Laos and the ASEAN members
stepping in after the Cambodian groups have met.
   All ASEAN members _ Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei,
Singapore and the Philippines _ reportedly have said they will
attend the meetings.
   In a joint statement Tuesday, the ASEAN ministers called on
Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia and said the
international community should keep denying Vietnam any aid that
support its occupation.
   However, several delegates said the bloc has shifted its
strategy from isolating Vietnam to trying to encourage it to take
part in negotiations.
   ASEAN strongly supports the three-party Cambodian resistance
coalition headed by Sihanouk that is battling the Vietnamese
forces. Vietnam says it now is in the process of withdrawing its
troops from Cambodia. It invaded its neighbor after fierce border
clashes with the radical communist Khmer Rouge government which
then ruled Cambodia.
   Tuesday's ASEAN statement also urged other nations to contribute
to a multilateral aid package for the Philippines, the most
troubled economy in ASEAN.
   On Thursday, the ministers will begin three days of talks with
ASEAN ``dialogue partners'' _ the United States, Japan, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and the European Community.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and West Germany's
deputy chancellor and foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, are
to attend. Shultz is expected in Bangkok Wednesday and will go on
to visit seven other Asian nations.
   Local newspapers said Tuesday that security was tightened at
Bangkok's international airport to block possible terrorist attacks
against Shultz, following the downing Sunday of an Iranian
passenger jet by U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf.
   ``All appropriate security measures will be in place for
Secretary Shultz's visit,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing
said.
   Shultz is expected to get a sympathetic hearing on America's
Middle East stance and general foreign policy, but the ASEAN
ministers signaled in their joint statement that they would exert
pressure on growing protectionism in industrialized nations.
   They also criticized the failure of Western nations to
adequately resettle Indochinese refugees, who receive initial
asylum in Southeast Asian countries and then often languish for
years in refugee camps awaiting permanent resettlement elsewhere.
   But the statement said only Vietnam could resolve the problem of
the flight of its ``boat people'' into the region.
   The ministers called for cooperation in the battle against
increased drug trafficking and abuse, which they said pose ``a
threat to all ASEAN societies.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on
Tuesday announced that he will resign this summer, even though he
said a 14-month investigation into his personal ethics ``fully
vindicates me.''
   ``This decision is something I made totally on my own and I was
not pressured by anybody,'' he told reporters here. He said he
submitted his resignation to President Reagan early Tuesday
afternoon by telephone.
   Meese said he expected to leave office at the end of this month
or early in August and that no successor had been designated. One
of Reagan's closest confidantes _ an aide who served Reagan in
California and then as a key member of his White House staff _
Meese has had a stormy tenure at the Justice Department since
arriving in March 1985.
   Meese took the step after independent counsel James McKay filed
his report on the investigation into Meese's conduct in office. The
830-page report, filed with a federal court, was not made public.
The report concluded there was no basis for filing a criminal
indictment.
   Meese said he had remained in his post until now because he
refused ``to allow myself to be hounded out of office by false
accusations.''
   The McKay report details Meese's ties to the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp., an Iraqi pipeline project, and two other
enterprises. Questions of improper conduct will be referred to a
Justice Department ethics unit, which itself could take months to
review the case.
   Meese said ``false allegations have been put to rest'' by the
McKay report, but conceded he had not seen it and did not know
precisely what was in it.
   Nonetheless, in a news conference here where Meese had been
working on an anti-drug program, the attorney general said ``with
the burden of false allegations now lifted'' he would look ahead to
return to private life.
   Meese is a longtime confidant of the president who served during
Reagan's first term as White House counselor. He succeeded William
French Smith as attorney general after surviving contentious
confirmation proceedings.
   His tenure at Justice was marked by more controversy. Aside from
the McKay probe, he spearheaded two failed Supreme Court
nominations and just recently the Justice Department has been
criticized for failing to follow up early indications of the
Defense procurement scandal.
   McKay's office, which launched its investigation of Meese on May
11, 1987, has been:
   _Examining Meese's assistance to Wedtech in 1981 and 1982, when
he was White House counselor.
   _Reviewing his actions in connection with a $1 billion proposed
Iraqi oil pipeline project after Meese became attorney general.
   _Delving into the attorney general's meetings with regional Bell
Telephone company executives and his favorable recommendation on
behalf of the firms at a time when he held $14,000 in phone
industry stock.
   _Looking into members of a Washington real estate family
arranging to pay a $40,000-a-year salary for Meese's wife while
leasing office space to the Justice Department.
   ``The fact that these allegations have been proved false and
there's no criminal proceedings fully vindicates me,'' Meese said,
adding that anything else in the report concerning his ethical
behavior constitutes ``mere commentary and opinion.''
   He had said previously that he might return to private life once
the investigation was concluded, and he said Tuesday he was
resigning to ``vigorously pursue'' his private goals.
   He said he might be willing to work with Vice President George
Bush should Bush be elected president.
   In Washington, Patrick Korten, a Justice Department spokesman,
said Meese made the decision to resign ``within the past week or
so'' and that the attorney general had been considering the timing
of a resignation ``for some time.''
   In his remarks, Meese said, ``I have informed the President that
I will be leaving the administration towards the end of July or
early in August, in order to accept new opportunities in the
private sector.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House
Judiciary Committee, said in Washington that she was ``very
surprised'' and pleased by the resignation.
   ``It's very important that we get on with running the agency,''
she said. ``Hopefully, this will help them put some people in to
bring a little dignity and vigor back.''
   Mrs. Schroeder, chairman of the House civil service
subcommittee, said she found it hard to ``restore the excitement
people used to have about public service ... when the chief law
enforcement officer was showing how to trim the edges of the law
rather than how to enforce it with enthusiasm and vigor.''
   She added: ``I think he was realizing he was a terrific
liability, politically, to George Bush. After this report is
unsealed, the big question was going to be, `Would you keep Ed
Meese on?' That would have become a big issue.''

<HEAD>Fitzwater Says Consensus Building for New Contra Aid Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Tuesday the Reagan administration believes there is ``a growing
consensus'' for further humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But Fitzwater, discussing Secretary of State George P. Shultz's
trip to four Central American countries, deflected questions about
new military assistance to the Contra rebels.
   Fitzwater said the Shultz visit to Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras last week was aimed at gaining the general
views of Central American leaders about U.S. policy in the region.
   Asked whether Shultz had found support or acquiescence to a
resumption of U.S. military aid to the rebels in view of the
collapse of peace talks with the ruling Sandinistas in Managua, the
spokesman said, ``Well, he didn't go down there seeking that kind
of information.''
   Shultz left Tuesday on a 15-day tour of several Asian countries,
and Max Kampelman, a special ambassador who had accompanied the
secretary on the Central American tour, briefed President Reagan,
Fitzwater said.
   Reagan and Shultz discussed the visit by telephone after the
secretary returned, the spokesman said.
   Nicaraguan resistance leaders had met with Shultz in San Jose,
Costa Rica, last Thursday, as the secretary was winding up his
trip. They said they discussed with him ways to win congressional
approval of new support for the Contras.
   The Congress has steadfastly refused to approve military aid to
the rebels, although lawmakers did give the OK in late March to a
$48 million package of humanitarian aid, to be disbursed during the
remainder of the current budget year, which ends Sept. 30.
   Only $17 million of that sum actually was earmarked for the
rebels. Another $17 million was designated for children victimized
by the war, while $10 million was set aside for a commission to
monitor compliance with a peace agreement and about $4 million for
administrative costs.
   Rebel leader Adolfo Calero said that in the San Jose meeting,
Shultz and Contra leaders discussed a $30 million aid package,
including the possibility of setting aside $7 million in an escrow
account for military assistance if the Sandinistas do not meet
promises for greater democracy.
   Fitzwater declined to specifically discuss what sort of aid
package is being bandied about within the administration, Congress
and the Contra resistance movement.
   ``I'm certain the secretary expressed our view that we want to
support the Contras to the best of our ability and that we have
continually supported humanitarian assistance for them,'' he said.
``But at this point, we have not reached any specific decisions on
the nature of that support and certainly no decisions on lethal aid
of any kind.''

   Afghan government forces bombed a
provincial capital in Afghanistan near Kabul after its brief
capture by Moslem guerrillas, Western diplomats said Tuesday.
   Bombs pounded Maidan Shahr after the insurgents occupied the
town June 24, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. They did not give a date for the air raids.
   Diplomats claim the bombing raids caused extensive damage.
Maidan Shahr, the capital of Wardak province, is 15 miles southwest
of Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   Ikram Gran, spokesman for the seven-party Afghan resistance
alliance that has headquarters in Peshawar, Pakistan, said reports
from Maidan Shahr are sketchy but indicate there were ``a lot of
civilian and mujahedeen (guerrilla) casualties.''
   The Afghan guerrillas are hoping for mass defections from
government forces after Soviet troops withdraw. Soviet forces,
which intervened to support the pro-Moscow Afghan government in
1979, began a nine-month pullout May 15 under a U.N.-sponsored
accord signed a month earlier in Geneva.
   Diplomats said guerrillas are massing less than 20 miles west of
Kabul in the Paghman area. They claimed guerrillas are arriving
from the Panjshir valley in the Hindu Kush range north of Kabul and
guerrilla teams have infiltrated Kabul.
   U.N. special envoy Diego Cordovez was expected to arrive in
Kabul from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad Tuesday to push for a
political settlement between the government of President Najib and
the guerrillas.
   Cordovez negotiated the Geneva accord and has conducted further
talks seeking a broad-based Afghan government to replace the
communists now in power. He has gone to Tehran, where he met with
Iran-based guerrilla leaders, and Pakistan, where he met with
government officials and Afghan refugees.
   Cordovez did not meet with the Afghan guerrilla leaders in
Pakistan. He said, however, a proposed coalition government devised
by the guerrilla alliance lacked mass support.

   Teams of Soviet inspectors
left for home Tuesday after inspecting five U.S. missile facilities
to verify compliance with the historic Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty.
   The 48 weapons experts and linguists boarded their IL-62
Aeroflot jetliner and left about noon, one day after conducting
24-hour spot checks at missile plants in Utah, Arizona, Colorado
and California, said Capt. Tom Dolney, spokesman at Travis.
   They returned to the base late Sunday and early Monday in time
for a July Fourth air and fireworks show. ``They couldn't help but
see it,'' Dolney said.
   ``They rested up when they got here because they went pretty
hard during their inspections,'' he said. ``There was so much to do
and so little time to do it in.''
   The inspectors conducted the first of five types of inspections
allowed under the INF treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in December.
   The ``baseline inspection'' is designed to verify the exact
number of medium-range missiles and related components to be
destroyed under the treaty.
   ``It's basically to count and record,'' said Lt. Col. Joseph
Wagovich of the Department of Defense's new On-Site Inspection
Agency.
   Another 22 inspectors who arrived with the five teams will
remain up to 13 years at the Hercules Aerospace Co. missile plant
in Magna, Utah, to monitor the gates of the facility where Pershing
missile rocket motors were made.
   The Soviets had arrived Friday as 20 American inspectors
departed for Moscow and the Soviet city of Votkinsk for reciprocal
inspections.
   Friday marked the first of 60 days allowed under the treaty for
24-hour spot checks at designated missile facilities in the U.S and
Western Europe and the Soviet Union, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
   Armed with tape measures, scales and Polaroid cameras, the
Soviets visited five sites: the Pueblo Army Depot Activity in
Pueblo, Colo.; a General Dynamics plant in San Diego, Calif.; the
Dugway Proving Ground, a remote Army installation in the Western
Utah desert; a cruise missile testing and training site at Fort
Huachuca, Ariz., about 60 miles south of Tucson; and Davis-Monthan
Air Force base near Tucson, a missile training center.
   Under the complex provisions of the treaty, the Soviets had the
right to conduct spot checks at any of the five sites this weekend,
and they didn't have to say how many of them they wanted to visit
until the last minute.

   A man purporting to speak for Islamic
Jihad claimed Tuesday the pro-Iranian faction would kill one of two
American hostages it was holding, but police said the deadline
passed without incident.
   ``The threat appears to be a hoax,'' said a police spokesman.
   The caller told the Voice of the Nation radio station that
either Americans Terry Anderson or Thomas Sutherland would be
executed to avenge the downing of the Iran Air jetliner by a U.S.
Navy missile cruiser in the Persian Gulf on Sunday.
   The Sunni Moslem radio quoted the caller as saying the group
would kill one hostage by 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) and dump the body in
the Syrian-policed seaside neighborhood of Ramlet al-Baida in west
Beirut. But the deadline passed with no developments, police said.
   ``We have patrols along the coastal boulevard where the
kidnappers said they will throw the body. But we haven't received
any report about any corpse,'' said the police spokesman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The caller did not elaborate and it was not possible to
authenticate the call.
   Earlier Tuesday, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem cleric, Sheik
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, said the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon
should not pay the price for the U.S. Navy's action in the gulf.
   ``I find no justification for making the hostages account for a
matter with which they have no link,'' said Fadlallah, spiritual
guide of Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be an
umbrella for the underground factions holding 18 foreign hostages.
   The statement was published by the Sohofiya News Agency, a
newsletter based in west Beirut.
   The United States said the USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Air
jetliner on Sunday after mistaking it for a jet fighter. Iran said
all 290 people aboard were killed, and Iranian leaders vowed to
seek revenge.
   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said of the anonymous radio threat: ``There is no
confirmation there is any connection to Hezbollah or that this is a
legitimate thing.''
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has insisted that its
statements would be typewritten and accompanied by a photograph of
a hostage to prove its authenticity.
   In Cadiz, Ky., Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said she was
concerned about the unconfirmed threat but tried to take ``some
comfort ... that Islamic Jihad has told us repeatedly that if a
photograph does not accompany the communication, then it's not
official.''
   On May 4, an anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic
Jihad called the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio to announce
that French captives Marcel Fontaine, Marcel Carton and Jean-Paul
Kauffmann would be freed. The three, who had been held by Islamic
Jihad, were freed several hours later.
   By all accounts, the kidnappers and their hostages are penned up
in a Shiite barracks in Beirut's southern slums by Syrian troops
who moved in last month to halt fighting between rival Palestinian
militias.
   Some observers believe that the militants have difficulty moving
around and may not be able to deliver statements as they used to do.
   Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held foreign captive in Lebanon.
He was kidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, 57, the acting dean of agriculture at the American
Universitry of Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Also Tuesday, about 2,000 Hezbollah sympathizers marched through
west Beirut's main streets, denouncing the U.S. attack.

   President Reagan visited ailing Salvadoran
President Jose Napoleon Duarte on Tuesday, who is described as
undergoing intensive chemotherapy but displaying ``a pretty good
attitude.''
   The Salvadoran president, who is suffering from liver cancer,
was visited for 15 minutes by Reagan and Vice President George Bush
at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center complex in the capital city.
   The president traveled by helicopter from the White House to
Walter Reed, where he was greeted by the vice president. After
shaking hands and waving at the crowd of residents across the
street from the hospital, the two men took a presidential limousine
into the complex for the visit with Duarte.
   Hospital spokesman Peter Esker, asked about Duarte's condition,
said, ``He's got a pretty good attitude.''
   Esker said Duarte had re-entered the hospital June 26 for ``an
intensive dose of chemotherapy.'' He was first admitted to Walter
Reed on May 31 and underwent three hours of cancer surgery on June
7.
   The spokesman said that after the chemotherapy ends within the
next several days, Duarte's doctors would decide whether he would
go home to El Salvador or possibly return for additional treatment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan invited
Duarte to visit the White House before departing Washington and the
Salvadoran president ``said he would like to, if it's possible.''
   Fitzwater added that Reagan offered Duarte a U.S. government
plane for his return home to El Salvador and Duarte accepted.
   The spokesman said there was no word on when Duarte would leave
the hospital.

   More than 2,000 Mississippi River barges
were backed up by shallow water Tuesday at Greenville and Natchez,
Miss., as towboat operators tried working in a convoy to pick their
way to Memphis.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has pledged to keep the
drought-diminished Lower Mississippi open to commercial traffic,
but a Corps spokesman said more barge backups will occur as dredges
work on shallow areas of the river.
   ``There'll be spotty stoppages probably all summer,'' said
Michael Logue, a Corps spokesman from Vicksburg, Miss.
   Southbound barges were stacking up at docking areas, and a
convoy of four towboats with 12 barges each set out Monday from
Cairo, Ill., said Cmdr. Michael Donohoe, commander of the Coast
Guard's Memphis district.
   A second group, with three to five towboats, was scheduled to
leave Wednesday.
   ``If one boat has a problem, the others will help out,'' Donohoe
said.
   Barges coming into the Memphis zone, which runs from
Caruthersville, Mo., to Greenville, are restricted to drafts of 8.5
feet, but Donohoe said the southbound convoys will have barges
drawing nine feet of water.
   By traveling together, he said, the workboats can pull each
other off sandbars or team up to push barges through tricky bends
of the low river.
   Dredging to deepen the channel from 7 feet began Sunday at
Greenville and delayed towboats with about 800 barges, while low
water just south of Natchez had about 1,200 barges backed up, Logue
said.
   Dredging at both sites was expected to take two to four days, he
said.
   The Mississippi, registering record lows, is more than 22 feet
lower at Memphis than it was this time last year.

   The announcement by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III on Tuesday that he would resign brought expressions of
relief from George Bush's presidential campaign and a terse
statement from the vice president himself.
   ``Ed did the right thing and I wish him well,'' Bush said in
remarks read over the phone by a staff member.
   The vice president's comment came shortly after Meese announced
in California that he would resign this summer, saying a special
counsel's report, filed Tuesday with a federal court in Washington,
had vindicated him. The report said there was no basis for a
criminal indictment of the attorney general.
   Meese's legal difficulties had been a source of constant concern
to the Bush campaign and two of his advisers had even publicly
called Meese ``a liability,'' although the vice president himself
had declined to say whether Meese should resign.
   In recent weeks, Bush and other Republicans who had spoken on
his behalf had sought to deflect the criticism by referring to
possible conflict-of-interest allegations concerning House Speaker
Jim Wright.
   Still, Tuesday's announcement came as a welcome surprise to Bush
supporters and campaign workers.
   ``He (Meese) got what he needed, not leaving town under the
cloud that he was guilty. On the other hand, the question now of
what are you going to do about Ed Meese certainly isn't going to be
asked any more,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national
co-chairwoman of Bush's campaign.
   ``I will disagree that there was a cloud over Bush, but there
were questions and this removes them, certainly,'' said Mrs. Martin.
   Bush campaign officials indicated they were caught by surprise
by Meese's announcement, made in Sacramento, Calif.
   ``Of course we are relieved. He did the right thing. Confidence
in him (Meese) had eroded,'' said one official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   As to Meese's assertion that he might be willing to work with
Bush should Bush be elected president, the same campaign worker
broke into laughter. ``No comment,'' said the official.
   Bush previously has said that he would not reappoint Meese as
attorney general in his administration if elected, or any other
current Cabient member for that matter, claiming he wanted to have
``a new team.''
   Bush in campaign appearances has stressed the importance of
ethics of government, claiming that he has personally been
untarnished by conflict-of-interest allegations and proposing the
establishment of a new White House office of ethics.
   However, while aides suggested privately that Bush would be
relieved if Meese would step down, the vice president never made
such a recommendation to either Reagan or Meese, Bush campaign
sources said.
   Meese and Bush met privately in May to discuss the situation.
Bush later told reporters that the embattled attorney general had
promised not to do anything to jeopardize his campaign.

   Heavy thunderstorms continued to soak parts of the Gulf Coast
Tuesday and flooded streets in Alabama, while hot, humid air baked
a large part of the nation from the Rockies to the Appalachian
Mountains.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from southeast
Texas to Alabama, with the southern half of Alabama receiving the
heaviest rainfall.
   In Alabama, more than 4 inches of rain fell at Auburn in the 24
hours ending early Tuesday afternoon, Newell got nearly 3 inches,
and 2{ inches fell at Pine Level, Hackneyville and Horseshoe Bend.
   Streets flooded in Tuscaloosa during the morning after more than
5 inches of rain fell in parts of the city and in Demopolis, which
received 1{ inches.
   Strong thunderstorms developed over parts of western Montana,
while widely scattered showers and thunderstorms developed over the
southern and central Rockies.
   A hot and humid air mass sent temperatures well into the 90s
over much of the area between the Rockies and the Appalachians,
with a sprinkling of readings over 100 degrees in the northern
Plains.
   Record highs for the date included 105 degrees in Fargo, N.D.;
99 in Fort Wayne, Ind.; 98 in St. Cloud, Minn.; and 97 in South
Bend, Ind., and Flint, Mich.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 52 degrees at Spokane,
Wash., to 106 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz., and Palm Springs, Calif.
The nation's low Tuesday morning was 39 degrees at Yakima, Wash.
   Wednesday's forecast called for mostly sunny and hot weather
across much of the nation. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were
forecast for most of the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, and for
parts of the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and New
England. Widely scattered thunderstorms also were forecast for a
large part of the Rockies.
   Highs were predicted to be in the 80s or 90s across much of the
nation. Highs were expected to stay in the 60s and 70s in the
Pacific Northwest and northern Plateau, while rising to between 100
and 110 degrees in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Iran Air Jetliner Stayed In Commercial Corridor, But Broadcast on
Military Frequency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian airliner shot down by a U.S.
warship in the Persian Gulf stayed within its commercial air
corridor, but was sending radio identification signals on a
military frequency identified with F-14 fighter jets, Pentagon
officials said Tuesday.
   A six-member investigating team landed Tuesday aboard the
warship, the USS Vincennes, to sort through computer records
containing conflicting information, including a determination by
another American ship in the Persian Gulf that the Iranian A300
airbus maintained a steady altitude of 12,600 feet rather than
descending from 9,000 feet to 7,000 feet as the Vincennes had
reported.
   Meanwhile, House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
emerging from from a closed-door intelligence briefing, said
military officials told his panel that the airliner never left a
commercial air corridor, contrary to original Pentagon reports. But
the plane did veer on a line towards the Vincennes, a factor cited
by the Navy as justifying the captain's decision to fire in the
belief he faced imminent attack.
   The commercial air corridor from Bandar Abbas to Dubai extends
5.5 miles either side of a line between the two cities. The Iranian
plane, according to the intelligence briefers, had strayed to the
west side of the corridor, about four miles from the center line,
and had steered eastward to get back to the center. That correction
put the craft, for a time, on a direct heading toward the cruiser,
they said.
   While it veered off from the center of the commercial corridor,
the plane never actually left the corridor, as was first claimed by
the Pentagon, Aspin said. ``It was in the corridor all the time,''
he said.
   Others present in the briefing said a Navy investigating team
was just arriving in the Persian Gulf and would begin sifting
through a large volume of information. Much of the electronic data
from the incident was recorded on tape and would be available to
the investigators, they said.
   But there still was no clear explanation for why the commercial
aircraft seemed to be emitting a transponder signal normally
identified with warplanes.
   One theory, Aspin said, was that the plane needed the military
signature in order to re-enter the airport at Bandar Abbas, which
is a joint civilian-military facility. ``We are looking for
possible explanations,'' Aspin said.
   Dniel Howard, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that the
Iranian aircraft was broadcasting over a radio transmitter known as
Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) ``in two modes. It was squawking on
Mode-3 ... a common identifier for both military and civilian
aircraft, used in air traffic control.''
   ``It was also sending signals on a military mode, Mode-2,'' said
Howard. ``And the signals that we were receiving, that the
Vincennes was receiving from that aircraft, were signals that we
had previously identified or associated with an F-14. That was
based on historical information in the Gulf.''
   ``No commercial airliners use Mode-2,'' he said.
   Pentagon officials initially reported Sunday that the Vincennes
had shot down an F-14. It wasn't until hours after that
announcement that Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, determined that it was an airliner that had gone down.
   That determination was made on the basis of communciations with
the Vincennes, Howard said.
   Crowe had said the decision to fire was based on classified
``electronic emanations,'' and gave no details.
   At a briefing Tuesday, Howard said, ``This is the first time
that we have revealed the fact that we could make identifications
based on other countries' Mode-2 IFF signals, and certainly those
from Iran ...
   ``The Mode-2 transmission mode is used by military aircraft, and
it identifies the tactical mission of that military aircraft. And
the particular signals that they were receiving were signals that _
there were certain aspects of it that they had identified or
associated with an F-14 previously in the gulf,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``It is a special piece of equipment which has to be put on the
aircraft and it can only be set on the ground ... the military
coding for Mode-2 is something that has to be encoded, set on the
ground,'' he said.
   He declined to speculate why the Airbus was broadcasting in
Mode-2.
   The spokesman also said investigators had a ``conflicting
report'' on the altitude of the Iranian aircraft from radar aboard
the USS Sides, an American warship that he said was adjacent to the
Vincennes. The Sides reported that the aircraft was flying at
12,600 feet, rather than the 9,000 feet reported by the Vincennes.
   The Sides also reported that the aircraft maintained a steady
altitude, rather than descending to 7,000 feet, as determined by
the Vincennes. Officers aboard the Vincennes said they based their
decision to fire in part on a determination that the approaching
aircraft was descending and accelerating to 450 knots, the flight
pattern of an attacking warplane.
   The control tower at Dubai, the intended destination of the
Iranian Airbus, reported that the aircraft was at 7,800 feet at the
moment it was hit, about the altitude determined by the Vincennes,
said Howard.
   The spokesman said no decision had been made on whether to offer
compensation to the survivors of the victims. On ``the question of
compensation, I can only say that I'm sure that our attorneys and
the legal authorities of the U.S. government will take that
question under study.''
   And he countered criticism that the sophisticated Aegis radar,
tracking and targeting system aboard the Vincennes should have been
able to tell the difference between the Airbus and an F-14.
   ``The Aegis system on board the cruiser, on board the Vincennes
... is an extremely sophisticated system ... that has as its
primary goal preventing having U.S. ships blown out of the water.
Its purpose is to destroy incoming aircraft, incoming missiles,
incoming ordnance, to protect our task force, our fleet.
   ``Part of that system ... is a radar system; but that radar
system can only identify objects based on their course, their
speed, and their altitude,'' said Howard.
   An officer on the Vincennes or another Aegis cruisers ``is
sitting in front of a scope ... is not looking at a blip, he's
looking at a computer-generated figure on the screen which
identifies this specific track.''
   ``... If you're looking at a blip, it's very, very difficult to
_ it's virtually impossible to distinguish size of aircraft by the
size of the blip.''
   ``So those who speculated that we should have been able to tell
the difference between an Airbus and an F-14, simply based on the
size of the radar blip, are mistaken,'' he said.

<HEAD>White FBI Agent Admitted He Discussed Retribution Against Black
Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white FBI agent admitted he wanted to put
``a burr under the saddle'' of a black fellow agent through a
campaign of harassment but asserted he meant his colleague no harm,
according to court documents.
   The admission, made in a 1985 affidavit by the white agent, Gary
W. Miller, was filed in U.S. District Court here on Friday in
connection with a lawsuit by Donald Rochon.
   Rochon, a black FBI agent, alleges he was the victim of a
campaign of racial harassment by white colleagues in field offices
in Omaha, Neb., and Chicago. Rochon has said that while living in
Chicago, where he was assigned from 1984 to 1986, his family's
safety was repeatedly threatened in anonymous telephone calls and
obscene, racist letters from white FBI agents.
   Documents provided to Rochon's lawyer as part of pre-trial
discovery include Miller's sworn admission that he forged Rochon's
signature on an application for death and dismemberment insurance
for Rochon's family. Rochon has charged that the unsolicited
insurance policy he received as a result of the mailing amounted to
a death threat.
   Miller, who was suspended without pay for two weeks as a result
of that and other incidents aimed at Rochon, stated in the July 30,
1985, affidavit that he did not intend to send Rochon anything
other than junk mail.
   ``At the time, I had no intention of harming Rochon by any of
this,'' he said in the affidavit. ``I did not think there would be
any repercussion. I did not think he would get anything but junk
mail.''
   In the affidavit, Miller said he and agent Thomas J. Dillon
discussed ``retribution against Rochon'' for his allegations of
harassment by agents. ``We discussed having his public utilities
turned off and sending coupons soliciting magazine subscriptions
and other items.''
   In the affidavit, Miller said he embarked on his campaign
against Rochon ``as personal revenge'' for making allegations
against Dillon, who worked with Rochon in Omaha and later in
Chicago.
   ``It was my way of putting a burr under his saddle,'' Miller
said.
   Miller acknowledged that he followed Rochon home one night after
work in order to discover his address, which had been kept secret
from other agents because of the harassment complaint that Rochon
filed within the agency.
   In a separate affidavit, Dillon said he had heard of ``many
incidents that have occurred against Rochon'' but denied
participating in any harassment.
   Members of Congress have sharply criticized the bureau over the
Rochon case and other discrimination claims. More than half the
FBI's Hispanic agents have joined in a separate lawsuit against the
bureau, charging discrimination in hiring and promotion.
   The Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission have already found that Rochon was the victim of
``blatant racial harassment'' in the FBI's Omaha office in 1983 and
1984. A federal grand jury is investigating the later incidents in
Chicago, which Rochon has contended were more serious than those in
Omaha.
   The white agents have called Rochon a troublemaker who brought
unfounded charges of racism against other agents in an effort to
get transferred to his hometown of Los Angeles.

   Iran said Tuesday that the Iranian
airliner shot down by U.S. missile fire had signaled it was a
civilian plane, and called it ``a premeditated, terrorist attack.''
   Iran requested an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council to
condemn the American action.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati met council
President Paulo Nogueira-Batista of Brazil on Tuesday. Mahallati
later said he expected the 15-member council, the highest U.N.
body, to meet early next week.
   U.N. officials said consultations on the Iranian request were
under way.
   A council meeting would embarrass the United States, which says
the missile cruiser USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian Airbus with
290 people aboard because the commander believed it to be an F-14
jet fighter on an attack course.
   Mahallati said Iran expects the council to issue ``an
unequivocal and direct condemnation of the United States for this
aggression'' and to call on the United States to immediately
withdraw its forces from the Persian Gulf.
   ``This kind of barbarism, a premeditated, terrorist attack is
thanks to the American presence,'' he said.
   Mahallati also said it is ``the undeniable obligation of U.S.
authorities to make an apology. But can an apology wash away the
blood of 290 innocent passengers? No.''
   He told a news conference that contrary to U.S. assertions, the
Iranian Airbus' transponder continuously ``was disseminating normal
signals ... to all radar that it was a civilian plane.''
   At the Pentagon, chief spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday that
the Iranian airliner had been broadcasting a radio identification
signal on a frequency used only by military aircraft, leading the
skipper of the Vincennes to believe he faced attack.
   Earlier Tuesday, Iran lodged a formal, written U.N. protest,
accusing the United States of ``massacring passengers in cold
blood'' and demanding a U.N. condemnation and probe.
   In 1983, the United States had requested such a Security Council
meeting to condemn the Soviet downing of a South Korean airliner
with 269 people aboard. But the resolution of condemnation was
vetoed by the Soviet Union, one of the five permanent council
members with veto power.
   The United States also would be expected to veto a measure
critical of actions it called necessary self-defense. The five
permanent council members are the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, China and France.
   Diplomats said Moscow was expected to use the session to call
for withdrawal of U.S. forces from the gulf and to promote its idea
of an international naval peacekeeping force under U.N. command to
replace the American presence.
   The United States and some of its allies oppose such a force and
say the Western presence is needed to protect strategic interests
in the oil-rich gulf and freedom of navigation in the waterway.
U.S. officials have said the downing of the Iranian Airbus will not
prompt the United States to leave the gulf.
   Iran's foreign minister Ali-Akbar Velayati, sent a letter
Tuesday to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, condemning
``this undoubtedly premeditated act of aggression.'' He said the
U.N. chief and Security Council must condemn the attack and compel
the United States to remove ``its expansionist naval forces'' from
the gulf.
   In Geneva, Perez de Cuellar indicated he had faith in the U.S.
inquiry into the incident and saw no need for a U.N. probe. He
earlier condemned ``what appears to have been a tragic error'' and
called for restraint by all parties.
   Perez de Cuellar has been trying to negotiate with Iran and Iraq
and persuade them to accept a cease-fire in their nearly 8-year-old
war. The Security Council demanded such a truce nearly a year ago.
   Mahalatti told reporters Tuesday that Iranian air force
commander Brig. Gen. Sallari, not further identified, informed him
that ``the plane for ... 14 minutes ... was disseminating the
normal signals of all civilian planes ... which proves to any radar
that this is a civilian plane.''
   ``The question is how the most sophisticated American warship in
the Persian Gulf could not receive it,'' Mahallati said.
   U.S. naval officials said the Vincennes sent seven radio signals
to the jetliner before firing, but received no reply.

   District Judge Alberto Miera was censured
publicly and suspended for one year without pay Tuesday by the
Minnesota Supreme Court for forcibly kissing his male court
reporter and other alleged misconduct.
   In reaching its decision, the court rejected the recommendation
of the state Board on Judicial Standards that Miera be removed from
office.
   ``Public censure, forfeiture of his salary for one year is
sufficient for protection of the public interest and to restore
confidence in the judiciary,'' Associate Justice Peter Popovich
wrote in the majority opinion.
   ``It will permit a time for healing of the wounds of all the
parties and any necessary rehabilitation,'' Popovich said. The
court did not spell out any rehabilitation requirements.
   Miera, 37, has been on what he says is a water-only fast for 56
days to protest alleged discrimination and injustice in society and
the judiciary system. He has vowed to fast 100 days, something
experts say means almost certain death.
   Theresa Miera, the Ramsey County judge's mother, said her son
was not immediately available for comment. Mrs. Miera said she had
no comment.
   The former court reporter, Neil K. Johnson, said the only ruling
acceptable to him would have been Miera's removal from the bench.
   ``It goes to show that if you make enough noise, especially a
minority, you can get away with just about anything,'' Johnson
said. Miera is Hispanic and calls himself bisexual.
   The court noted that Miera's term expires in January 1991.
   ``The citizens of Ramsey County know him and his work and are in
a position to evaulate his performance,'' Popovich said. ``They can
remove him by ballot if they determine we have been too lenient.''
   Associate Justice Rosalie Wahl, in a separate opinion, said she
agreed with findings of judicial misconduct but said the penalty
was too severe.
   Appointed to the bench by Gov. Rudy Perpich in August 1983,
Miera was suspended by the Supreme Court with pay from his $67,400
a year post earlier this year.
   Miera refused to discuss the matter when the case was argued
before the Supreme Court May 24.
   The Board on Judicial Standards in February adopted the findings
of a three-judge panel that Miera should be removed from office for
making sexual advances to Johnson, and for inappropriate remarks
and gestures to others.
   Johnson, who worked for Miera two periods from 1984 to 1986, won
a civil suit against the judge in the spring of 1987. Johnson was
awarded $375,000 in damages, which was later reduced by the trial
judge to $125,000.
   Denise D. Reilly, counsel for the Board on Judicial Standards,
had said Miera's comment that colleagues on the Ramsey County bench
were ``bloodthirsty hypocrites'' had undermined public confidence
in the judicial system.

   Two senior members of Congress urged President
Reagan on Tuesday to pay compensation to families who lost
relatives aboard an Iranian jetliner downed by a U.S. missile, but
officials said the absence of diplomatic relations between the two
countries complicated such an effort.
   The idea was under active consideration at the State Department,
the Pentagon and the White House, acording to sources, and one
congressional source said it was likely the White House would make
some sort of offer to compensate victims within the next few days.
   Others, however, predicted no decision would come until after a
Navy investigative team completes its review of the incident in two
to three weeks.
   ``I think it would be a wise idea,'' said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``There's a clear admission by our president that this
was an unfortunate accident,'' and Congress likely would provide
the money for such payments, he said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, speaking in London, raised
the possibility that a sincere U.S. apology and an offer to
compensate bereaved families of the 290 victims of Sunday's missile
attack in the Persian Gulf might ``assuage the grief'' and would be
supported by Congress.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the
compensation issue, said ``it's a matter that has not been raised
yet'' and said it was too early to say what might happen.
   Some on Capitol Hill urged caution. ``Talk of reparations is
premature,'' said Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich. ``They ought to
cool their heels until we have all the information.'' And Rep. Tom
Downey, D-N.Y., suggested any compensation ought to be linked to
the release of U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon.
   One congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said administration officials are recommending a quick aid offer on
a humanitarian basis to differentiate the United States from the
Soviet Union, which rebuffed all requests for compensation
following its 1983 shootdown of a Korean Air Lines jetliner with
269 people aboard.
   The White House may make a public offer to compensate families,
but it is unclear how such an offer could be carried out.
   Because of the touchiness of relations between the United States
and Iran, the lack of clear precedent and the uncertainty of legal
issues involved, such an effort could take many months and is far
from certain to succeed, said legal experts in Congress and the
administration.
   Congress would take a major role in any payment, particularly in
providing the millions of dollars such a move would likely cost. In
addition, the administration would want strong backing from
lawmakers before taking a step so heavy with foreign policy
implications, officials said.
   But ultimately, the decision on whether to pay reparations would
almost certainly have to be made by President Reagan because of the
foreign policy implications of such a move, said a senior State
Department official who demanded anonymity.
   ``You've got a basic policy choice, with a very high profile,''
said another administration legal expert.
   There also is the question of legal authority for making the
payments. Under international law, no nation has to compensate for
damages that result from legitimate military operations. But the
Pentagon does have authority to make payments of up to $100,000 per
person in accidents.
   Most recently, the United States denied liability for damages to
neutral embassies in Tripoli, Libya, in a 1986 bombing raid. And
similar requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struck
during the bombing of Haiphong harbor during the Vietnam war.
   But if the damage resulted from a clear mistake, such as the
missile attack on the USS Stark by an Iraqi warplane last year that
killed 37 sailors, compensation may be paid. Iraq admitted error
almost immediately, and negotiations are continuing on the proper
amount of damages.
   The United States has compensated individuals for damage done by
troops on maneuvers in Central America, and is paying owners of a
fishing boat shot up by mistake in the Persian Gulf.
   In another incident, Israel paid reparations to the United
States following what Israel said was a mistaken attack on the USS
Liberty in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war.
   In that case, the payment was what lawyers term ``ex gratia'' _
made out of professed sympathy, but without admitting fault or
liability. That could well be the form of any U.S. payment to
Iranian families, one official said.
   In any case, payment of reparations would require some sort of
formal contact with Iran to negotiate amounts and terms. Because
there are no diplomatic relations, such talks would be difficult to
arrange.
   The only forum where the two sides currently have regular direct
contact is a tribunal meeting in The Hague, the Netherlands, to
settle claims by both sides stemming from the 1979 Iranian
revolution.
   Any discussion of reparations would be well outside the scope of
that tribunal's official duties, said one State Department official.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with thousands on strike in
Armenia over leadership's presentation of ethnic dispute. No

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people went on strike in the capital
of Armenia, apparently unhappy over the Armenian leadership's
presentation of an ethnic dispute at the national Communist Party
conference, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   The Soviet government daily Izvestia said the strike began
Monday, one day after ``many thousands'' of people met in the
Theater Square of Yerevan, the capital of the southern republic.
   Most flights in and out of Yerevan were canceled, it said.
   In a Tuesday edition, Izvestia said: ``Like yesterday a series
of the city's industrial concerns aren't working, or are working
with less than a full work force.'' It said food stores and
industries, as well as restaurants and medical services had been
working Monday.
   The newspaper said farm work was going on in Stepanakert, the
largest city of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, but that many
other industries and institutions there also were shut down.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a territorial dispute
between Armenia and the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but the mountain enclave's
predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February
to be annexed to Armenia.
   Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan is against it.
   At least 32 people were killed in riots over annexation which
broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, at the end of February.
   Izvestia said the thousands of people who gathered on the
Yerevan city square Sunday listened to a television broadcast by
delegates to the four-day party conference in Moscow, which closed
last Friday.
   Armenian party leader Suren Arutyunyan said in remarks broadcast
on Soviet TV during the conference that authorities could not
normalize the situation in Armenia, where large demonstrations
frequently have occurred in support of Nagorno-Karabakh's demand.
He proposed that the conference take up unspecified amendments to
the Soviet constitution.
   The disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has sent the
issue to national authorities, and the constitution specifies no
way to solve the dispute.
   Delegates who spoke on television supported Arutyunyan's call
for restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd.
   But Izvestia said that after a ``stormy debate'' on the square,
a committee was formed that called for a general strike after
laying down a series of demands, including a quick, favorable
resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
   The committee demanded that the Soviet Supreme Court take over
the trials of those charged in the Sumgait violence and demanded
full information about the alleged poisoning of workers at a
factory in the town of Masis.
   Izvestia provided no more information about the Masis incident,
except to say an investigation was under way.
   The party conference called for greater attention to republics'
calls for economic autonomy, but said authorities would not
tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic tensions.
   Besides Azerbaijan and Armenia, delegates from the Baltic states
of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also brought up ethnic questions
at the conference.
   About a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three Estonian
political prisoners had gathered more than 6,000 signatures by
Tuesday during a five-day demonstration in Tallinn, Estonia.
   ``We will continue the demonstration until they are freed or
until the authorities give us an exact date for their release,''
Eve Parnaste said as she carried a poster at the protest outside
the Estonian Supreme Court building.
   She said the three prisoners had been demanding publication of a
secret 1939 pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that
placed the Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia under
Moscow's control.
   All three were arrested this year, charged with spreading
anti-Soviet propaganda or slandering the Soviet state.
   Miss Parnaste's poster said, ``KGB is an evil empire,'' using
the initials for the Soviet secret police.

   A team of military experts headed by an
admiral arrived Tuesday night to investigate the attack in which a
U.S. Navy vessel shot down an Iranian jetliner.
   The group of 18 arrived on a military plane from the United
States after a stop in Spain. They were met by Rear Adm. Anthony A.
Less, commander of the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle East.
   The team is headed by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, director of
Plans and Policy for the U.S. Central Command headquarters in
Tampa, Fla.
   The group made no statement after arriving.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman said earlier that the team would conduct
its investigation in secret, and would remain in the Persian Gulf
for ``as long as it takes'' to determine what happened.
   They will interview the captain and other officers of the
missile cruiser USS Vincennes, which shot down the Iranian airliner
on Sunday because its crew believed the plane was an F-14 fighter
jet.
   The team includes six investigators _ a military lawyer and
technical experts, one of them a specialist in the computerized
``Aegis'' radar-weapons system aboard the Vincennes.
   A Navy source said it was ``highly doubtful'' the investigators
would have any direct access to Iranian officials, but that their
findings ultimately might become part of any legitimate
international inquiry, should one be conducted.

   Democratic officials are discussing a plan
under which Jesse Jackson would give a prime time televised speech
on the second night of the party's national convention, as would
the other Democrats who lost out to Michael Dukakis in the fight
for the party's presidential nomination.
   Under the outline being discussed, former President Jimmy Carter
would speak during prime time on Monday night, the same evening as
a keynote speech by Texas treasurer Ann Richards and remarks by
party chairman Paul Kirk, according to officials who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis will be formally nominated during
Wednesday night's session, and his running mate the night after.
Both Dukakis and his vice presidential partner will deliver their
acceptance speeches during Thursday's night's convention finale, as
is customary.
   Kirk met with top officials from Dukakis' and Jackson's
campaigns in Boston on Tuesday to discuss a schedule for speakers
during the four-day Democratic convention beginning July 18. The
three commercial television networks are expected to provide live
coverage for two hours on each of the four nights of the convention.
   ``We had a good meeting, a good session,'' said Ron Brown, who
is heading Jackson's convention operation.
   Brown said further meetings were planned to ``get the convention
put together.''
   Asked if any agreement had been reached on outstanding platform
issues on which Jackson has threatened to carry his fight to the
convention floor, Brown said, ``The decision is that we have no
present intention of dropping any of them.''
   Carter's prime time address would come before an audience in his
home state of Georgia, and mark a continuation of his political
rehabilitation since his 1980 defeat at President Reagan's hands.
   In addition to Jackson, officials said it was possible that
former Democratic presidential contenders Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Paul Simon of Illinois; Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt would speak Tuesday
night. One-time front-runner Gary Hart is not expected to address
the convention; associates say he will write a newspaper column and
provide commentary for Italian television during the gathering.
   The presidential nomination roll call is expected to dominate
the Wednesday night session. Dukakis has announced that his name
will be placed in nomination by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. Jackson
has not yet said who will nominate him.
   Democrats will ratify Dukakis' running mate on the fourth and
final night of the convention, with Dukakis aides hoping to avoid
any rebellion by Jackson forces against their selection.

   Airports in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles stepped up
security Tuesday following Iran's vows to avenge the deaths of the
290 people in a jetliner shot down by an American warship.
   ``Our police and security people are very much aware of the
situation and and the potential for what could happen with talks of
retaliation,'' said Ron Wilson, spokesman at San Francisco
International Airport.
   ``We're sensitive to the Iranian incident and we've taken
immediate steps to increase our security posture,'' Dale Harris,
superintendent of operations at Los Angeles International Airport,
said Monday.
   Officials at airports in Atlanta, Baltimore, Miami, Oklahoma
City and Dallas-Fort Worth said no changes were made.
   Boston's Logan International Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella
said security was beefed up, but added ``It's stuff that probably
can't be seen.''
   Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, Newark and LaGuardia
airports in the New York metropolitan area, declined comment on
security.
   ``As in all matters involving security at our facilities, we
will not elaborate on specifics. However, the current situation is
being closely monitored with the appropriate authorities.''
   Bill Malone, spokesman for the Philadelphia International
Airport, also declined to comment on security.
   Cynthia-Val Jones, spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of
Aviation, said officials were stressing the need for ``extra
diligence'' but didn't plan to take any new security measures at
O'Hare International Airport.
   ``We're not adding any additional people. What we have done is
as different shifts come on we make sure that all our security
personnel are alert and aware of the threats and do their jobs with
extra diligence,'' she said Tuesday. ``They're keeping an eye out
for anything that might look suspicious.''
   Wilson said travelers in San Francisco might detect longer waits
at baggage-security points before boarding planes.
   ``More luggage will be opened and visually checked,'' Wilson
said. ``If there's anything that has the slightest question through
the X-ray machine, that person will be asked to open the bag and
let the monitor check it.''
   Airport police and security guards have been told to be extra
observant. But the number of security guards was not increased.
   No threats have been directed toward the airport, he said.
   Harris refused to reveal the extra precautions taken at Los
Angeles other than to say more personnel were on duty.
   ``We have increased our deployment and increased security
awareness or alertness,'' airport police Sgt. Karen Schultz said.
   Iran's ambassador to West Germany said Tuesday that retaliation
will not occur on U.S. soil for the downing of the Iran Air flight.
The 290 passengers and crew are presumed dead.
   Customs and border officials in Texas said they had not
tightened security because of Iran's threat.
   ``I do not know of any actions that have been taken because of
the plane being shot down,'' said Charles Conroy, Customs spokesman
in Houston.
   Doug Mosier, spokesman for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector,
said: ``To my knowledge, there's been no message relayed as to a
specific alert to be on the lookout for Iranian terrorists.''

   Critics of Edwin Meese's ethical conduct
renewed their attacks Tuesday after the attorney general announced
his intention to quit, but supporters praised Meese and agreed he
was vindicated by a still-secret independent counsel's report.
   ``All he wanted to do was hang in there just to vindicate
himself and then resign,'' said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, a
strong Meese backer.
   ``I don't know of anybody else who's been kicked around as much
as Ed Meese and his family have been in this town,'' Hatch said.
   But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., whose governmental affairs
subcommittee issued a critical report on Meese's ethics, said Meese
should stop saying the report vindicated him until a federal court
releases the document.
   He said an ``ethical cloud'' will hang over Meese until the
report is made public, and added that the report could be
``devastating.''
   Rep. John Conyers, Jr., D-Mich., said Meese's ``departure as the
nation's chief law enforcer is a good day for American law, and for
the perception of integrity of the Department of Justice....
   ``Any student in an introductory course in American politics
knows that simply staying out of prison cannot be the standard for
remaining as the attorney general,'' Conyers said.
   Meese announced plans Tuesday to quit later this summer, saying
the report by independent counsel James McKay after a 14-month
probe into his actions ``completely vindicates me.''
   Sources said the report recommends no criminal indictment
against Meese for his ties with the scandal-tarred Wedtech Corp. or
any other activity.
   Michael Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential candidate,
called Meese's resignation ``long overdue.''
   ``I don't think he should have been appointed attorney general
in the first place and he should have stepped down long ago,'' he
said. ``But this administration's inability to set high standards
for public service will not be solved by the Meese resignation. We
need a president who believes in public service who will set those
high standards and make our government something Americans can be
proud of once again.''
   But Vice President George Bush, the certain Republican nominee,
said, ``Ed did the right thing and I wish him well.'' The remarks
were in a statement read by a staff member.
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel said he was ``saddened'' that
Meese had decided to leave the Cabinet but said, ``His decision to
resign nevertheless is quite understandable when we consider the
intense public assaults to which he and his family have been
subjected.
   ``Ed Meese has rendered exceptionally valuable service to our
president, to our country and to those of us who have been
privileged to serve with him in this administration. A champion of
both personal and economic liberties, he has been a valiant leader
in the fights against crime, drugs and excessive federal government
intrusion into our daily lives,'' Hodel said.
   Other conservatives offered similar reactions.
   ``I'm sorry to see someone who has been such a good public
servant and a dedicated Reaganaut leave office,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill. ``I think he's been a good attorney general and I'm
sorry to see him leave if he isn't leaving on his own terms.''
   Conservative spokesman Richard A. Viguerie said in a statement,
``Ed Meese's resignation is a blow to conservatives but not
unexpected. On the list of conservative heroes for the 1980s, Ed
Meese's name is at the top.''
   The ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, commended Meese for serving the country
``in a highly capable manner.''
   And Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Meese ``made a wise decision
in using the vindication of the independent counsel's investigation
to put this controversy behind him....'' The way is now cleared, he
said, for the appointment of an attorney general who can do his job
``without the burden of this controversy upon his shoulders.''
   Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., agreed with Meese's decision. ``The
fellow has been charged with a lot of hearsay allegations, none of
which the special counsel has been able to establish,'' he said.
``But on the other hand, the perception is not good.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said the McKay investigation
``cleared Ed Meese of any criminal wrongdoing, something he
predicted from the start.''
   On the other side, liberals hailed Meese's departure, many
saying it should have happened long ago.
   Among those was Norman Dorsen, president of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``Mr. Meese is due his day in court to resolve his own personal
legal troubles, and like every American, he deserves to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty,'' Dorsen said in a statement from
ACLU headquarters in New York. ``But the jury of public opinion is
already in with respect to his record on civil liberties. He leaves
behind a legacy stained with disrespect for the Bill of Rights and
the citizens it was crafted to protect.''
   On Capitol Hill, one of Meese's most vocal critics, Sen. Howard
M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Meese was ``an embarrassment to the
United States. His resignation is long overdue and should have come
months ago.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of a civil service
subcommittee that has criticized the ethical standards of the
Reagan administration, said, ``Hopefully, this will help them put
some people in to bring a little dignity and vigor back.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said he was surprised at the
timing, adding, ``The damage has already been done'' to the Justice
Department.
   He added, ``I'm sure the withdrawal is not to refurbish the
image of the Department of Justice.... I didn't think anything
could get him to leave. Certainly, everybody's been telling him
he's doing enormous damage to the department.
   ``The only thing I can think of is that finally the political
gurus at the White House went to him and said, `You're causing too
much damage to the candidates this fall. Good-bye.'''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., agreeing with the decision to resign,
said Meese ``could have served without controversy'' in a position
such as secretary of transportation.
   Hyde said Meese's resignation ``takes him out of the equation
now as a figure of controversy'' in the upcoming elections.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., asked whether the
resignation would have the effect of focusing more attention on the
alleged ethical problems of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said
the two situations were ``entirely different.''
   Meese's case involved a review by an independent counsel of
whether the attorney general should be charged with criminal
conduct, Foley said. ``The review by the ethics committee (of
Wright's finances) has nothing to do with criminal misconduct.''

<HEAD>Capitol Rotunda's $500,000 Improvement Is Complete</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto WX10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A restoration team on Tuesday finished the
year-long, $500,000 task of cleansing a century of grime from a
famous fresco on the ceiling of the Capitol rotunda.
   The cleaning was the first for ``The Apotheosis of George
Washington,'' the 4,664-square-foot work by Italian immigrant
Constantino Brumidi completed in 1865 at the apex of the then-new
rotunda.
   ``This has become a very colorful painting,'' said conservator
Bernard Rabin of Cranbury, N.J., who headed the five-person
restoration team. ``It will have almost a jewel-like quality.''
   The fresco _ a painting made on a wall as the plaster is drying
_ depicts Washington surrounded by several maidens, Greek gods,
American inventors and a host of others.
   One previous cleaning was commissioned in 1957. But officials
said the job resulted in a darkening of the fresco because the
mural painter, Allyn Cox, simply repainted it to match the dirty
colors that had accumulated over the years.
   Rabin's work has left the fresco several shades brighter than it
was.
   Workers constructed 180-foot-tall metal scaffolds to reach the
painting. Atop the scaffolds was a wooden platform just below the
fresco that the conservators stood on and which has obscured the
art from viewers.
   Conservators planned to begin Tuesday night to remove the
scaffolds, erected in June 1987, and are expected to have them
completely removed in 10 days.
   Rabin estimated that he and his helpers retouched about 5
percent of the fresco in spots where the original paint had flaked
off. The rest of their work involved removing dirt and Cox's paint,
accomplished with sponges and a solution of water and detergent.
   ``It wasn't like washing windows,'' Rabin said.

   A severe earthquake was recorded Wednesday near
Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean, the Hong Kong Royal
Observatory reported.
   It said the quake, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale,
occurred at 4:40 a.m. Wednesday (4:40 p.m. EDT Tuesday), and was
centered 260 miles north-northeast of Port Moresby, the capital.
   No other information was immediately available.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale can cause
severe damage in populated areas, while one measuring 7 is
considered a major quake, capable of widespread, heavy damage.

<HEAD>Consultant's Dealings With Congressman Detailed On Wiretaps,
Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conversations that were secretly taped as part
of the government's investigation of Pentagon contracting show a
defense consultant raising money for projects of a powerful Florida
congressman, according to a report broadcast Tuesday.
   NBC News said it had obtained transcripts of federal wiretaps of
Charles Gardner, a former official of Unisys Corp. now working as a
consultant for defense contractors.
   Gardner organized a charity golf tournament in the district of
Rep. Bill Chappell Jr., chairman of the House defense
appropriations subcommittee, that raised nearly $100,000 from
defense contractors, NBC said.
   The FBI is investigating the tournament, which was held this
spring to raise funds for Daytona Beach Community College, the
report said.
   It is not clear if Chappell acted illegally, but it was clear
that he knew Gardner was asking the defense contractors to
contribute to the tournament, the report said.
   ``You're selling four tickets for each hole?'' the transcript
quotes Chappell as saying.
   ``No. We're selling one ticket for each hole and that admits
four people. ...,'' Gardner replies. ``That way, it is not a
donation, it's an admissions fee.''
   On the tapes, Westinghouse executive Milton Borkowski, asked to
give $5,000 to the golf tournament, complained to Gardner that
``this kind of stuff is out of control ... all this money that goes
to charities.''
   Gardner notes that Westinghouse helps make the $9 billion Aegis
ship radar system, and says it needs Chappell's support. ``Put it
in and we get the $100 million and get the ... program going,'' he
said.
   In the end, Westinghouse gave $5,000, as did 18 other defense
contractors, NBC reported.
   Calls by The Associated Press to to Chappell's offices in
Daytona Beach and Washington went unanswered Tuesday night.
   Chappell refused to grant an interview with NBC News when told
about the contents of the report, said NBC correspondent Fred
Francis.
   The wiretapped conversations also reveal that consultants knew
the Navy considered a $178 million system of electronic equipment
called CORTS, or Coherent Receive Transmit System, ``useless and
obsolete.''
   But Gardner was recorded as saying, ``We are going to rely on
Chappell not to give an inch to the Navy.'' Later, another
consultant is quoted as telling Gardner that Chappell ``dug his
heels in'' and backed the system.
   Executives of Unisys, which makes CORTS, donated $20,000 in
political contributions to Chappell in the last four years. He
insists it didn't influence his actions, NBC said.

   Iran told the world Tuesday the U.S. Navy
created ``a wave of rage'' by shooting down an Iranian jetliner,
and the designated heir to power urged terrorist attacks on
American targets around the world.
   Tehran radio quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying in letters
to heads of state that Iran has the ``right to avenge the blood of
innocent children, men and women.'' Iran said all 290 people on the
Iran Air flight were killed when the Airbus A300 was shot down
Sunday.
   ``While the U.S. leadership has not yet officially declared its
war against Iran's people, it has, by resorting to this criminal
act, which followed earlier aggressive actions, taken a serious
step toward war with a revolutionary, Islamic nation,'' he said.
   Khamenei asked other nations to condemn the United States for
the action by the U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes, which he said
``roused a wave of rage in Iran.''
   At the United Nations in New York, Iran demanded a Security
Council meeting, condemnation of the United States for the
``terrorist attack'' and withdrawal of U.S. military forces from
the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since
September 1980.
   The radio said Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, designated
successor to revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
urged him in a letter to order ``revolutionary cells ... inside and
outside Iran ... to unleash their wrath on American financial,
political and military targets everywhere.''
   He said Iran must ``ignite a fire which will burn America and
its lackeys.''
   Khomeini, 87, declared Monday: ``We must all be prepared for a
real war and go to the war fronts and fight against America and its
lackeys. I donate my worthless life for the sake of our victory.''
   In other developments:
   _ A six-man team of U.S. experts led by an admiral arrived in
the gulf Tuesday to begin a confidential investigation. U.S.
officials said the airliner, bound for Dubai from a
military-civilian airport in Bandar Abbas, was mistaken for an
Iranian F-14 jet fighter.
   _ Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati told a news
conference at the United Nations that Iran Air Flight 655 had sent
``normal signals ... to all radar that it was a civilian plane.''
The Pentagon said Tuesday it transmitted information on two radio
channels, one ``identified with F-14s.''
   _ American military sources said at least two other mix-ups
between U.S. warships and commercial aircraft had occurred in the
past month. They said one involved a pilot who though a Navy ship
was ordering him to change course, and in the second a vessel just
arriving in the gulf fixed its fire-control radar briefly on an
airliner.
   _ Air traffic to the United Arab Emirates was disrupted. Iran
Air canceled its daily flights from Bandar Abbas to Dubai and said
it would not use the corridor ``threatened by the American naval
presence.'' Dubai canceled flights of other airlines using the same
corridor over the Strait of Hormuz, and air traffic to Abu Dhabi,
105 miles away, also was affected.
   Iran has been trying to improve relations with other nations to
end its isolation, particularly U.S. allies in Western Europe, and
a wave of terrorism corresponding with its fiery rhetoric would
jeopardize that effort.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, the parliament speaker and military
commander, said Tuesday in Tehran: ``Today is the day of test for
international organizations in the world. We will watch the
reaction of the United Nations, the court in The Hague and other
organizations for their reaction to this frightful crime.''
   A dispatch from the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
him as saying that, even if the destruction of the airliner ``was a
mistake, America cannot be forgiven.''
   ``This catastrophe is worse than the crime at Hiroshima,'' he
said, referring to the first use of the atomic bomb in August 1945.
``The Americans created the disaster, they paved the way for the
disaster and committed the crime. We cannot allow ourselves to
refrain from taking revenge. The choice of timing is up to us, not
to America.''
   Iran has accused the Americans of deliberately shooting down the
plane, which it said carried 252 Iranians and 38 non-Iranians.
   Tehran radio said Tuesday that 200 bodies had been recovered and
wreckage had been found, but not the flight recorder.
   State television repeatedly showed scenes of floating bodies.
   Iran's envoy to the International Civil Aviation Organization,
Ali Akbar Golrounia, said Tuesday in Toronto that Iranian air
traffic controllers heard no warnings from the Vincennes and that
the jetliner was still climbing when it was hit. He asked the
Montreal-based ICAO to investigate.

   The remains of U.S. Navy Capt.
William E. Nordeen, the military attache in Greece killed by a
terrorist bomb last week, arrived here Tuesday to be prepared for
burial.
   The C-5B transport plane arrived at Dover Air Force Base at 5:47
p.m. EDT to a brief planeside ceremony. Nordeen will be buried
Wednesday in Arlington National Cemetery.
   The Navy Band from Washington played the ``Navy Hymn,'' before
pallbearers slowly carried the flag-draped coffin from the plane
and loaded it into a waiting hearse.
   A 19-sailor honor guard was on hand, as well as a four-sailor
color guard.
   Vice Adm. L.A. Edney expressed his condolences to Nordeen's
family.
   ``We in the Navy are determined that Capt. Nordeen's loss not be
forgetten,'' Edney said in a statement.
   ``Bill Nordeen knew risk throughout his career. He faced it
daily in thousands of hours of flying, and he faced it again when
he volunteered for attache duty in Greece, where one of his
predecessors had been shot to death in an ambush.''
   Nordeen's wife, Patricia, and 12-year-old daughter, Annabel,
accompanied the remains on the flight. Also on board were his
brother, Navy Capt. Michael Nordeen, commanding officer of the USS
Mars in San Francisco; his brother-in-law, Michael Lilly, from
England; and Thomas J. Miller, a friend and State Department
employee in Greece.
   Nordeen's mother, Edna H. Capello, of Centuria, Wis., and other
friends and relatives also witnessed the return.
   Nordeen, 51, was killed June 28 when a bomb in a parked car
exploded, hurling his armor-plated car off the road as he was
driving to work, authorities said.
   A leftist terrorist group called November 17 took responsibility
for the attack, as it has for 13 other political assassinations in
Athens since 1975, including the murders of two other American
diplomats.
   None of the killings has been solved. Greek police, who are
being assisted by FBI and State Department investigators, say they
have made no progress in the Nordeen case so far.
   Nordeen, of Centuria, was to retire in August after 30 years in
the Navy, said his sister, Carla Anderson. He had been stationed in
Greece for three years.

   Commercial flights to the
United Arab Emirates were canceled, delayed or diverted after a
U.S. warship shot down an Iranian jetliner headed to the Persian
Gulf country, airport sources said.
   Iran Air has stopped its daily flights from the Iranian airport
of Bandar Abbas across the gulf's Strait of Hormuz to Dubai
airport, airline sources said.
   It is the same flight the Iran Air aircraft was making when it
was hit Sunday by missile fire from the USS Vincennes, which U.S.
officials said mistook the Airbus 300 for an Iranian F-14 fighter
jet. Iran said all 290 aboard were killed.
   Dubai airport has canceled all flights of other airlines using
the same route over the strait, and declared a state of alert since
the downing of the Iranian plane, airport sources said.
   Air traffic to Abu Dhabi airport, 105 miles from Dubai, was
altered, causing great confusion among passengers.
   In addition to delays of several hours, flights by the region's
major carrier, Gulf Air, which were scheduled to arrive at the Abu
Dhabi airport did not come in. Passengers instead had to disembark
at Sharjah airport, about 120 miles to the south, without advance
notice, said the sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   Several passengers told The Associated Press they planned to sue
the airline or the travel agencies that were responsible.
   Japan Air Lines said Monday that its twice-weekly flight from
Tokyo to Athens has changed its Persian Gulf route to avoid the
area where the Airbus was shot down. A JAL official said the planes
will begin flying over Abu Dhabi instead of over Dubai. The route
is farther south and will add five minutes' flight time, the
official said.
   There was also conflicting information on the number and
nationalities of passengers and crew aboard the downed Airbus.
   Iranian official reports said there were 290 people aboard the
Airbus and the figure was repeated by Mustafa Foumeni Haeri,
Iranian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates at a news conference
on Monday.
   But a manifest provided by the Iran Air office in Dubai showed
there were only 288 people, including crewmembers on board. The
list, in English, did not give nationalities for most of the
victims, who included Arabs, Pakistanis, Indians and Italians in
addition to the Iranians.
   Haeri told reporters that among the victims were Japanese and
Koreans. But the Japanese and South Korean embassies in Abu Dhabi
said that, judging from the manifest, they did not believe there
were any Japanese or Koreans on the plane.

   Two American Indians accused of taking
hostages at a a Lumberton newspaper were freed from jail under
$100,000 unsecured bonds Tuesday and ordered not to set foot in
Robeson County while awaiting trial.
   Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, walked out of the
federal courthouse in New Bern to the cheers and hugs of about 35
residents of the county, where they had protested alleged official
corruption.
   U.S. Magistrate Charles McCotter set the conditions for their
release after a 90-minute hearing. But he indicated he was
reluctant to free the two men, who are accused of taking up to 20
people hostage at The Robesonian newspaper Feb. 1.
   ``I don't know of a clearer case for detention because these are
serious crimes,'' McCotter said before setting out a long list of
restrictions for bond. But McCotter said a ruling by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last week, which held that Hatcher and
Jacobs had been denied a timely detention hearing after their
arrest, gave him no choice.
   The conditions require Hatcher and Jacobs to stay out of Robeson
County, avoid all contact with government witnesses, report daily
by telephone to federal probation officers and to return to the
residences of court-approved ``custodians'' by 9 p.m. daily.
   Hatcher is to stay with an uncle, Jim Hatcher of Winston-Salem,
who promised to give his nephew a job as a mechanic's helper.
Jacobs is to live in Halifax County with a family friend, Patricia
Richardson, who said he could make and sell Indian crafts while
staying with her family.
   ``I've seen murderers and rapists let out on bond right away,
but they put us through hell for the last five months,'' Jacobs
said as he left the courthouse.
   Hatcher praised the support of fellow American Indians.
   ``It shows there are more people than us who know what's going
on,'' he said.
   Asked if Hatcher and Jacobs would cooperate with a state task
force investigating their charges of drug trafficking by law
enforcement officers in Robeson County, defense attorney Bob Warren
said, ``We've been cooperating with the task force, and will
continue to.''
   Hatcher and Jacobs previously had been denied bond three times _
twice by U.S. Magistrate Wallace Dixon in Fayetteville, and most
recently by U.S. District Court Judge Terence Boyle, in April.
   Hatcher and Jacobs are scheduled to be tried on the
hostage-taking and federal firearms violations next week in federal
court in Raleigh, but Assistant U.S. Attorney John S. Bruce has
said a delay is expected.

   It started out like just another of the
myriad of social causes that teachers debate when they gather for
their annual convention.
   The 8,227 delegates gathered for the National Education
Association's annual meeting were deadlocked Tuesday on a
resolution in support of Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt, a convicted
murderer and former Black Panther who has been in prison since
1972. His supporters argue he didn't get a fair trial because of
FBI interference. His case has been publicized on CBS's ``60
Minutes.''
   His sister happens to be a teacher in Los Angeles, and an NEA
member.
   The voice vote was too close to call. So NEA President Mary
Hatwood Futrell ordered a roll-call vote, which the union hasn't
done in years because it is so time-consuming.
   For the next hour, as delegates awaited the results of this
somber vote, strange things began to happen in the Superdome where
the teachers were seated.
   Teachers erupted in human waves to pass the time. They tossed
beach balls, Futrell included.
   The teachers asked Futrell to sing or dance. She demurred. ``Why
don't you do the wave again?'' she asked, and they obliged,
followed by a brisk chorus of ``When the Saints Go Marching In.''
   Futrell then boasted that she had been a cheerleader in college.
This brought a loud demand for her to demonstrate her skills.
   She led a chant: ``We want a pay raise! How 'bout you?''
   After an hour, the vote was in, and it was indeed close:
   For the resolution: 3,219. Against: 3,415. Abstentions: 293.
   ``I'll tell you what,'' said Futrell. ``Now you see why we don't
have roll-call votes very often.''

   A 20-foot boat flipped over, drowning
four of 15 passengers as they returned from a Fourth of July
fireworks display, and the Coast Guard said Tuesday the craft was
overloaded and vulnerable to capsizing.
   The bodies of three of the victims were recovered and the search
of New Bedford Harbor continued for the body of a 5-year-old boy
presumed killed in the accident, New Bedford Police Officer Ray
Furtado said.
   The search was suspended because of darkness Tuesday evening,
Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Whalen said, adding that local
authorities would resume it Wednesday without Coast Guard
assistance.
   Furtado said the boat was headed to the dock when ``two boats
passed them, one on each side, at a high rate of speed, causing
large waves.'' He said the overloaded boat flipped over.
   ``It was definitely overloaded, definitely over capacity,'' said
Coast Guard Petty Officer David Foley of the number of people on
the boat.
   The manufacturer's recommended capacity for the fiberglass boat
was 2,000 pounds, according to a plate attached to it. Empty, there
would be between two and three feet between the water and the top
edge of the boat, said Coast Guard Lt. Robert Campbell.
   With 15 people aboard ``at best it would have been half that,''
Campbell said. ``All it would take would be a foot and a half of
sea'' to tip the boat.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Brandy Ian said there were about 100
boats in the area when the accident occurred. Other boaters rescued
the 11 survivors.
   Federal maritime law does not set limits on boat occupancy, but
negligence can be penalized with a $1,000 fine, Ms. Ian said.
   The owner and operator of the boat was Barry Constant, 31, of
North Dartmouth. He told police that none of his passengers wore
lifejackets, although the boat was equipped with them.
   The dead were Jean Fauteaux, 49, Maria Carvalho, 27, and her
daughter, Melissa, all of North Dartmouth. The missing boy is
Kenneth Carvalho.
   State police and the Bristol County district attorney's office
also were investigating the accident.

   A probate judge exceeded his guardianship
authority over a mentally retarded man at the Walter E. Fernald
State School by ordering him to undergo an AIDS test, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision written by Justice
Francis P. O'Connor, threw out the AIDS testing order issued in
1986 by Probate Judge Eliot K. Cohen to the Fernald school, a
Department of Mental Retardation facility in Worcester County.
   A state Appeals Court judge had stayed Cohen's order pending the
Supreme Court decision, so the man, identified in the high court
decision only as ``Anthony,'' had yet to be tested. The order also
applied to another unidentified male Fernald resident who allegedly
was Anthony's sexual partner.
   Denise McWilliams, who is both Anthony's attorney and director
of the AIDS law project at the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and
Defenders organization in Cambridge, said she was pleased with the
decision but disappointed it didn't go further.
   The ruling ``is very limited in its terms,'' she said, noting
the justices did not take up larger issues concerning state
requirements on written informed consent from patients before tests
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be made and their
results disseminated.
   The justices didn't take up those issues ``because it is clear
that the probate and family court judge did not have authority to
assume control of the department (of mental retardation) and to
order the department to conduct tests on Anthony and another
party,'' the court wrote.
   ``The judge, in effect and incorrectly, usurped the function of
the executive branch of the state government,'' the court said.
   Mary Breslauer, spokeswoman for the attorney general's office,
which represented the Department of Mental Retardation, said that
``while the ruling is a narrow one, we are gratified that the
(court) agreed with our position that the trial judge had
overstepped his boundary by ordering an AIDS test.''
   Cohen had ordered Anthony and the other man to be tested for
AIDS even though that was not the issue before him.
   The judge had been asked by the state to amend an earlier
court-ordered medical plan for Anthony so he could have a venereal
wart removed. By the time Cohen heard the case, the wart had
disappeared, and Anthony's physician and department officials asked
that the request be dismissed.
   But Cohen ruled that the wart, the unrestrictive setting at
Fernald and Anthony's alleged homosexual activity were ``conducive
to AIDS,'' and he ordered Anthony and the other patient to undergo
the AIDS test.
   That order came despite comments from state officials and others
at Anthony's hearing that ``neither Anthony nor any other resident
of the (facility) showed symptoms of AIDS,'' that the facility was
developing an AIDS education program and that AIDS testing was
``not medically advisable'' for Anthony, the high court said.

<HEAD>French Ambassador Presents Credentials In Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's newly appointed ambassador to
Iran presented his credentials in Tehran, ending a one-year
diplomatic rupture, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Tuesday.
   But Iran said Paris should be more critical of the downing of an
Iranian airliner by the U.S. Navy.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Ambassador Christian Graeff
presented his documents to Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on
Monday.
   In his meeting with Velayati, Graeff expressed ``deep regret''
over the U.S. downing Monday of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian
Gulf. Iran says all 290 aboard died. The French Foreign Ministry
also commented on the incident.
   But IRNA quoted Iran's amabassador to France, Ali Ahani, as
telling a news conference in Paris Monday that ``Iran expects
France to be a little more candid in its official statement on the
incident and show less reservation in reacting to it.''
   The two countries broke off relations July 17 last year after
Iranian Embassy officials in Paris refused to let French
authorities question an embassy translator suspected of terrorist
involvement.
   French police surrounded the embassy. In turn, Iranian troops
sealed off the French Embassy in Tehran. France said Iran had
effectively severed relations.
   Iran and France named ambassadors to each other's capitals on
June 23, a week after they announced resumption of relations
following the May 5 release of the last three Franch hostages held
by Iranian-backed Moslem militants in Lebanon.
   Sources have said the conditions for the hostages' release
centered on repayment of $1 billion loan made by Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi of Iran before the Islamic revolution in 1979.

   One possibility emerging Tuesday to
explain the downing of an Iranian passenger jet was that the plane
could have been signaling, but the U.S. warship that shot it down
got the wrong message.
   The Airbus A300 involved was delivered to Iran Air six years ago
with two transponders aboard that should have responded to
identification requests from the USS Vincennes, Airbus spokesman
David Velupillai said in this southern French town.
   In Washington, chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday
that the aircraft had been broadcasting a radio identification
signal on a frequency used only by military aircraft, leading the
Vincennes captain to believe he faced attack.
   A U.S. expert said the jetliner could have installed its own
transponder, ``to work with their own (Iranian) air defense
system.''
   Iranian airliner pilots, however, denied that Flight 655 would
have been sending on a military channel.
   The Vincennes sent electronic identification requests and voice
warnings to change course, beamed over civilian and military radio
channels, U.S. military officials said. The plane, mistaken for an
F-14 fighter, was shot down Sunday and all 290 aboard died.
   Electronic identification signals are received by transponders,
electronic devices that are standard equipment on Airbus planes,
said Velupillai.
   He said the make of transponders on Airbus planes is up to the
individual customer and he did not know the manufacturer of the
transponders on the Iran Air jet.
   Velupillai did not know if the original transponders delivered
with the plane had been changed or how many transponders, if any,
had been on board.
   All transponders, regardless of make, work to international
standards on a system called Secondary Surveillance Radar. A
civilian ground station sends a pulse to which the plane
automatically responds with data on the height of the aircraft, its
bearing and _ if the pilot has dialed in a code given by the air
traffic controller _ the identification code of the plane.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, told a news
conference at U.N. headquarters in New York on Tuesday that Iranian
air force commander Brig. Gen. Sallari, not further identified,
informed him:
   ``The plane ... for 14 minutes ... was disseminating the normal
signals of all civilian planes ... which proves to any radar that
this is a civilian plane.''
   Howard said at the Pentagon that the Iranian aircraft was
broadcasting over a radio transmitter known as Identify Friend or
Foe ``in two modes. It was squawking on Mode-3, which is ... a
common identifier for both military and civilian aircraft, used in
air traffic control.''
   ``It was also sending signals on a military mode, Mode-2. And
the signals that ... the Vincennes was receiving from that
aircraft, were signals that we had previously identified or
associated with an F-14 ... No commercial airliners use Mode-2.''
   Bill Reed, a spokesman at Allied-Signal Inc.'s Bendix
Communications divison in Towson, Md., said Tuesday that one of the
two transponders with which jetliners are normally equipped is a
backup.
   He confirmed that when an air traffic controller or other
transmitter sends an interrogatory signal, the device transmits a
response, or transponds, with the plane's altitude and identity.
   Reed said that in the case of an aircraft approaching a Navy
ship in a combat area, the ship probably would send signals, trying
to trigger transponder response, in every possible civilian and
military mode. ``They probably were hitting them with every mode
they had,'' Reed said.
   He said most civilian airliners respond only in civilian modes,
but equipment can be added.
   ``They may have put their own transponder in there to work with
their own air defense system,'' Reed said.
   In London on Tuesday, Capt. Massoud Razavi, a senior Iran Air
pilot, denied U.S. claims that the downed A300 was transmitting on
two transponders, including a frequency used previously for
military information.
   He told a news conference at the Iranian Embassy: ``The
transponder we are using is the standard transponder and we use
`mode A' which is the civilian code. The code is given by Dubai (a
United Arab Emirates member, 150 miles south of Bandar Abbas) and
it is preset into the transponder before takeoff.''
   Capt. Mehroujan Gharib, an Iran Air Boeing 747 supervisory pilot
and safety officer, replied ``No'' at the same conference when
asked if Iran Air civilian planes sometimes used a military
frequency.
   Both Iranian pilots indicated it was hard to believe the pilot
of Flight 655, bound from Bandar Abbas to Dubai, would not have
responded to U.S. Navy challenges.

   Sheriff's deputies say they had to dodge
bottle rockets while breaking up a Fourth of July party outside the
home of Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald T.
Sterling, but the businessman denied Tuesday that he had such a
party.
   Authorities are trying to determine if Sterling gave alcohol to
minors following the disturbance outside his seaside estate late
Monday, said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzales.
Seven belligerent partygoers were arrested outside the home,
Gonzales said.
   The party apparently was open to the public and attracted an
estimated 1,000, many of them teen-agers, Gonzales said. The clash
with deputies took place about 11 p.m., he said.
   ``An unspecified number of people not only refused to leave but
began inciting people to resist the deputies,'' Gonzales said.
``Other juveniles began shooting bottle rockets at the deputies and
at a sheriff's helicopter that was hovering overhead.''
   Sterling's spokesman, Michael Selsman, said the only party his
boss threw was a hot dogs-and-soda affair for about 25 high school
classmates of his daughter, and that gathering ended at 9:30 p.m.
He denied Sterling served liquor to minors and said his boss hadn't
heard any bottle rockets or seen anyone skirmishing with deputies.
   ``The public beach was jammed,'' said Salsman, vice president of
Sterling's real estate investment firm. ``If there was a
disturbance it had nothing to do with Sterling.''
   Confronted with the businessman's denial, sheriff's spokesman
Gonzales checked with his superiors and said the department stood
by its version.
   ``An investigation will be done to determine if Mr. Sterling was
furnishing alcoholic beverages to the minors,'' Gonzales said.
   Two 16-year-old youths were arrested for investigation of
assault with a deadly weapon, the bottle rockets.
   Three other 16-year-olds and a 15-year-old were arrested for
investigation of inciting a riot. Authorities witheld the
juveniles' names.
   Carson Turner, 23, of Los Angeles, the only adult taken into
custody, was arrested for investigation of battery on a peace
officer and released on his own recognizance, Deputy Bill Wehner
said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Of the arrestees, only one 16-year-old boy remained in jail
Tuesday after his parents refused to pick him up, Wehner said.
   Sterling's home is about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles in this seaside celebrity colony.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims New Heights Liberated in Kurdistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   Iraq said Tuesday its forces recaptured
two mountain peaks in a 16-hour battle with Iranian troops in
northern Kurdistan province.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
Balgha and Dobzah mountaintops, 7,805 feet and 7,591 feet above sea
level, respectively, were ``liberated, marking a new defeat for the
rotten heads in Tehran.''
   There was no immediate Iranian comment.
   Both heights overlook Tikrit, President Saddam Hussein's
hometown, which is about 60 miles north of Baghdad.
   Iraq's 5th Army Corps recently has mounted assaults to dislodge
Iran from lands it occupies in Kurdistan, a mountainous region
inhabited mainly by Iranian-backed Kurdish rebels fighting the
Baghdad government for autonomy.
   But the Iranians still hold the key border towns of Halabja,
Panjawin and Hajj Omran.
   Since April, the Iraqis also have recovered the Faw peninsula
and the oil-rich Majnoon islands in southern Iraq and claim to have
retaken heights in the central sector of the the 730-mile warfront.
   The battles shifted the balance in Iraq's favor and marked a new
turn in the nearly 8-year-old Persian Gulf war in which Iraq was
mostly on the defensive.
   Iranian officials have claimed the United States was helping
Iraq and called for general mobilization along the front.
   INA said thousands of Iranians were killed, wounded or captured
in the latest battle that began at 4 a.m. Tuesday (8 p.m. EDT
Monday) and continued through the day.
   ``These events prove that the defeat of the Iranian regime is
imminent, God willing,'' the agency quoted an unidentified military
spokesman as saying.

<TEXT>
   The 3,000 delegates of the American
Federation of Teachers gave their unofficial nod to Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, but it was Jesse Jackson's praise of teachers
that brought the crowd to its feet on Tuesday.
   Both presidential candidates addressed the convention via
satellite as the four-day gathering was ending.
   ``If we are going to take on our foreign competitors, we have to
make teaching an honored and valued profession again,'' said
Dukakis, who spoke from Boston.
   The Massachusetts governor, the likely Democratic nominee,
called for an educational venture capital fund to improve teachers'
pay and training. He said the cost would be a fraction of the
budget for the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Dukakis told representatives of the 677,000-member union that
the election ``will be the most important and closest since 1960.''
   The AFT, like other AFL-CIO unions, refrained from endorsing
anyone before the Democratic and Republican conventions. But it
will send more than 150 delegates to the Democratic convention _
three-quarters of them for Dukakis and the rest for Jackson.
   ``Obviously we're leaning toward Dukakis because he's the
front-runner candidate,'' said Steve Hahn, publicist for the AFT.
   Dukakis's remarks followed Jackson's impassioned appeal for
doubling teachers' pay and his call for all of society to take
responsibility for educating children.
   ``The mass media, the churches and temples have a broader
responsibility,'' said Jackson, speaking from New York City.
   ``If the schools give homework, the parents must have the child
home to do the homework. We must pay for better educational
services ... by doubling the pay of teachers, as our most
fundamental investment in the future of America.''
   He called the relationship between his mother, his teacher and
his principal a ``love triangle'' that helped him succeed.
   Jackson recalled his strict sixth-grade teacher promising the
class, ``I will never teach down to you'' and telling the students
that ``one of you...may become governor or president someday.''
   Also on Tuesday, the delegates passed a resolution seeking
protection for gay and lesbian teachers against discrimination in
hiring, promotion and all aspects of teaching.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis also hooked up by satellite with the National
Education Association, meeting in New Orleans, and apologized for
not being there in person.
   ``But with a little luck, we should be able to visit each other
often in Washington after November,'' he told the more than 8,000
teacher delegates.
   NEA president Mary Hatwood Futrell told Dukakis that ``we've
always considered you to be a friend of working men and women,
especially those in the public sector.''
   Last week, at Futrell's urging, the NEA board of directors
endorsed Dukakis for the Democratic nomination.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis picked up the pace in his search for a
running mate Tuesday, bringing in former rivals Albert Gore Jr. and
Richard Gephardt for face-to-face talks. Gephardt said he'd take
the job, but Jesse Jackson dismissed contenders other than himself
as ``unknown quantities.''
   President Reagan promoted George Bush as his White House
successor, suggesting voters would choose the vice president over
``out-and-out liberal'' Dukakis if they did ``a little comparison
shopping.''
   Dukakis, meeting briefly with reporters in Boston, criticized
the administration for ``one scandal after another'' after Attorney
General Edwin Meese III announced his resignation.
   Vice President Bush, out of the public eye at the White House
all day, said through a spokesman, ``Ed did the right thing and I
wish him well.''
   Bush was mentioned by Meese, who spoke to reporters in
California after the independent counsel investigating his conduct
in office filed a report concluding there was no basis for criminal
indictment.
   Meese thanked Bush ``for his fairness and decency in regard to
this matter.'' Republican strategists, including several Bush
aides, had said Meese's legal problems were hurting Bush, who has
campaigned on the Reagan administration's record, but the vice
president never publicly criticized Meese or called for his
resignation.
   Dukakis, however, said, ``I think the Meese resignation is long
overdue. I never thought he should have been appointed in the first
place.''
   He added, ``The Meese resignation itself is not going to solve
this administration's problems. ... This administration has had one
scandal after another, one resignation after another.''
   In Boston, Dukakis met for more than an hour with Gephardt in
his Statehouse office.
   When the Missouri congressman was asked afterward whether he he
would accept a spot on the ticket, if offered, he said, ``I would
do that.''
   ``I want Mike Dukakis to be elected president and I want him to
be a great president and I will do everything I can to that end,''
he said.
   Gore met with Dukakis at the governor's Brookline hme for just
over an hour Tuesday evening. He made no comment to reporters as he
arrived, and when he emerged, he said only, ``I don't have a
statement.''
   The president told a conservative gathering in Washington, ``The
American people understand what liberalism means and don't like it,
so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito _ they're
putting on political trench coats and sunglasses.''
   Reagan quipped that the Democrats ``will never even in the
lowest whisper mumble the `L' word again.''
   Gore, the Tennessee senator, and Gephardt flew to Boston at
Dukakis' invitation. The vanquished rivals treated Dukakis harshly
during the heat of the primary campaign but both men eventually
endorsed the Massachusetts governor.
   In addition, Dukakis scheduled a meeting with Indiana Rep. Lee
Hamilton on Wednesday. The private sessions fueled speculation that
the certain Democratic nominee was moving closer to naming a
running mate.
   Jackson, who dined and watched fireworks with Dukakis and his
wife Monday night, said Tuesday he was the most qualified for the
vice presidential nomination but continued to duck questions about
whether he would accept the spot if it was offered to him.
   ``The fact of the matter is, I would be an asset,'' Jackson
said. ``I'm convinced that my presence would unleash new hope in
this country, regain more people.''
   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond
their districts and beyond their home states,'' Jackson said in
Boston before leaving for New York, where he held a series of
editorial board meetings.
   Aides to Jackson and Dukakis, meanwhile, began discussing their
pre-convention differences, with party chairman Paul Kirk at hand.
The two campaigns remain apart on several platform issues but
Jackson painted a picture of unity and predicted a convention ``far
less hostile and rancorous than past years.''
   The Democrats' keynote speaker, Texas treasurer Ann Richards,
paid a courtesy call on Dukakis and came away with a
``comfortable'' impression of him. But the feisty Richards, asked
if Dukakis had any recommendations for her speech, smiled and said,
``Michael Dukakis isn't going to tell me what to say.''
   Democratic officials were discussing a tentative convention
framework in which Jackson would deliver a prime time television
speech on Tuesday night, the second night of the party sessions,
sources said.
   These sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said
several other vanquished primary contenders would likely speak
during prime time on the same evening, including Gore, Gephardt,
Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
   Former President Carter is expected to make a prime time
appearance on Monday night, the first night of the convention.
   Dukakis will be nominated on Wednesday night, as is customary,
and he and his vice presidential running mate will deliver
acceptance speeches on Thursday night, the final night of the
convention, the sources said.
   Dukakis is scheduled to return to Washington next week to hold
pre-convention meetings with House leaders. Some Dukakis aides held
out the possibility that a decision on a running mate might be made
by then although they insisted there was no timetable.

<HEAD>Authorities Perplexed After Finding 13 Incendiary Devices in Salem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bomb squads temporarily sealed off parts of
Salem Tuesday as three incendiary bombs exploded and 10 others were
found outside buildings and under bridges leading to the city.
   The bombs that exploded caused only small fires and no one was
injured. Bomb disposal experts managed to defuse the other devices.
   ``We have no indications of any motive at this time. We have no
suspects,'' said Sgt. Marvin Jenkins of the Indiana State Police.
``Due to the fact no one has been injured and there's no property
damage yet, we're very strongly hoping that this is just a poor
joke.''
   But Mayor Frank Newkirk Sr., who found one of the bombs next to
a bridge, said the planting of the devices ``was obviously an act
of terrorism in my book, certainly done by a wacko.''
   This quiet, southern Indiana community of 6,000 residents is
surrounded by the Blue River and Brock Creek. Bombs were laid under
all six bridges leading into the city.
   Portions of the town were sealed off temporarily as bomb
disposal squads from Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis and
Fort Knox in Kentucky defused 10 devices, each of which contained
timers attached to as many as 26 sticks of dynamite and were
concealed in paper grocery sacks.
   The Washington County Courthouse was evacuated as were several
businesses, said Paul Lyles, emergency management director for the
county Department of Civil Defense.
   The bombs were hidden under sticks and other debris, Lyles said.
   The devices that went off produced only smoke and small fires,
and their construction indicated the person responsible was not
experienced in handling explosives, he said.
   ``They used black powder as the cap, and it didn't detonate.
Luckily, the guy who put it there didn't know much about
explosives,'' Lyles said.
   ``The incendiary devices were not set so much to go bang but to
set fires,'' said Lt. Ken Hollingsworth of state police.
   All of the bombs were turned over to agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which was investigating along with
the FBI, Indiana State Police, Army experts and local officials.
   A spokesman for the sheriff's department said a transient
believed to be from Arkansas was picked up for questioning Tuesday
morning. However, there was no word Tuesday night on any arrests.
   Most of the devices were found during the morning, with the
first discovered about 3 a.m., the sheriff's department said.
   Although people were allowed to return to the business district
during the afternoon, Lyles said: ``We're still cautious. ...
People should continue to look because they may not all be
located.''
   Morris Strange, who lives across from a service station where
one device was found, said he arrived home to find officials
surrounding it. ``Of course I was scared. You don't expect this to
happen in any town in the U.S. This isn't the Middle East.''

   Prime Minister David Lange
underwent surgery Wednesday to remove a lesion from a coronary
artery, and was resting comfortably after the operation, a
spokesman for his office said.
   Lange, 45, was admitted to Auckland's Green Lane Hospital last
Saturday after suffering from chest pains. The pains returned on
Tuesday and the surgery took place early Wednesday, said the
spokesman, who was not identified.
   The spokesman said the surgery, called a balloon angioplasty,
involved using a catherer inserted through the armpit to place a
small balloon across the narrow part of the coronary artery.
   The operation was performed under local anaesthetic without
complications.
   Lange's condition was ``comfortable'' and he was in good
spirits, the spokesman said.
   A spokesman for the hospital's cardiology department said full
surgery was ``not being seriously considered.'' He said it was
hoped Lange would be discharged around the middle of next week.
   Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer is acting as prime
minister during Lange's hospitalization.

<TEXT>
   Israeli security forces impersonated an ABC news
television crew to trick a Palestinian youth into coming with them
and then arrested him, the network charged Tuesday.
   ABC President Roone Arledge sent a telex Tuesday to Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir protesting the incident 1{ weeks ago,
said Elise Adde, ABC's director of news information.
   As of Tuesday evening, there had been no response from the
Israeli government, she said.
   ABC World News Tonight on Tuesday aired a report saying Nizar
Dakdouk was arrested by Israeli civilians posing as ABC News
personnel.
   Dakdouk's family home in Bethlehem was demolished June 16
because the Israeli army said he had thrown a firebomb at a bus,
according to the report. The next day, the youth and his mother
complained on Israeli television that if he was suspected of
something the army should have arrested him before blowing up the
house, ABC said.
   A week after the television appearance, two carloads of Israeli
civilians posing as ABC News personnel arrived at the Dakdouk
family's temporary housing in the village of Salfit and said they
wanted to interview Dakdouk and his brother on the site of the
destroyed house, the report said. The boys agreed to go.
   Once they were at the site, one of the cars sped off with
Dakdouk, and he was later arrested, ABC said.
   ``ABC News is deeply distressed by this and insists that an
investigation be conducted immediately to ascertain who authorized
such an action,'' said Arledge in the meessage to Shamir.
   ``There are no circumstances that could justify security forces
impersonating ABC News personnel,'' he said. ``Such activity
presents grave perils to the safety of legitimate journalists.''
   ABC News reported in Tuesday's broadcast that it had learned
that ``the impostors were members of the Israeli secret security
service, Shin Bet.'' It said a Shamir spokesman, who was not
identified, said he knew nothing of the incident.

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 Yugoslavs demonstrated
in this central town on Tuesday, shouting ``Down with the
government!'' and demanding higher wages, witnesses and the Tanjug
news agency said.
   Most were workers from a major shoe and rubbber factory, Borovo,
who went on strike last Saturday, Tanjug said. They want 100
percent pay increases and full instead of partial payment of wages
for June.
   Current wage scales were not available.
   The strike was the latest in a series of recent actions in
different parts of communist Yugoslavia protesting new economic
measures.
   The government in May linked wages to productivity as part of a
severe austerity program designed to cut inflation, now running at
about 175 percent, and improve economic performance.
   Government officials claim no alternative to the program exists
if the country wants to pay off its $21 billion foreign debt.
   Witnesses told The Associated Press by telephone from Vukovar,
about 60 miles west of Belgrade, that demonstrators carrying
Communist Party and Yugoslav flags demanded changes in the
country's leadership.
   They refused to return to work despite repeated appeals and
promises by local officials, Tanjug said.
   Yugoslavia listed a record 1,600 strikes last year, involving
over 300,000 workers, but most of those work stoppages did not go
beyond factories.

   The opposition-controlled National
Assembly on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved President Roh Tae-woo's
nomination of noted moderate Lee Il-kyu as new chief justice,
ending a prolonged dispute.
   The unicameral parliament endorsed the 68-year-old Lee as chief
justice of the Supreme Court and head of the judicial system by a
vote of 275 to 14, with three absentions.
   His term will be limited to two years, since the legal age limit
for chief justice is 70. Lee, a former Supreme Court justice, is
known for his lack of involvement in politics.
   The assembly last week rejected Roh's first nominee for the job,
Chung Ki-Sung, in a major setback for the president, who took
office in February for a five-year term.
   Lee succeeds Kim Yong-chul, 60, who resigned last month under
pressure from hundreds of junior judges demanding democratic reform.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III announced
Tuesday he will resign later this month or early August, even
though an independent prosecutor's 14-month probe into his official
conduct ended without indictment and ``completely vindicates me.''
   Meese, 56, made his surprise announcement at a news conference
in Sacramento, Calif., 3,000 miles away from his office and the
courthouse where Independent Counsel James McKay filed his 830-page
report. The document was not made public, but McKay did not seek
charges against Meese for his ties with the scandal-tarred Wedtech
Corp. or any other activity, according to sources.
   Each aspect of the investigation involved Meese's relationship
with longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, who is under indictment for
alleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal.
   Meese said he informed President Reagan of his decision by
telephone shortly before announcing it at the news conference. He
said he would return to private life either late this month or in
August.
   The president praised Meese, his confidant of two decades, as a
``darned good attorney general'' and said he had no one in mind to
succeed him. ``That will all come later,'' said the president.
   Meese's decision removes a stumbling block from Vice President
George Bush's presidential campaign. The vice president is said to
be uncomfortable by the continuing controversy over the attorney
general's actions, but he has refrained from criticizing Meese
publicly.
   Meese has been a favorite political punching bag of prospective
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and other Democrats.
   In a written statement, Bush said only: ``Ed did the right thing
and I wish him well.''
   Dukakis called Meese's resignation ``long overdue.''
   ``I don't think he should have been appointed attorney general
in the first place and he should have stepped down long ago,'' he
said. ``But this administration's inability to set high standards
for public service will not be solved by the Meese resignation. We
need a president who believes in public service who will set those
high standards and make our government something Americans can be
proud of once again.''
   Meese said he resisted calls for his resignation while McKay was
conducting his probe because he refused to ``allow myself to be
hounded out of office by false accusations.''
   But now, he said, those allegations have been put to rest'' and
the time has come for him to return to private life.
   Meese thus announced the end of a tenure as the nation's top law
enforcement official that was stormy even before he took office. He
survived an attempt by some Senate Democrats to block his
confirmation in 1983, and was involved closely with the appointment
of two failed Supeme Court nominations.
   Thoughout it all, though, Meese held the trust of the man who
counts most in the Reagan administration. The president turned to
Meese to conduct an early investigation into the Iran-Contra affair
_ a probe which reaped Meese more criticism from congressional
Democrats _ and it was Meese who first announced to an unsuspecting
world that proceeds from the sale of arms to Iran had been diverted
to the Contra rebels.
   It was none of that which prompted the investigation by McKay
which culminated in the report he filed with a special panel of
appellate judges in Washington. The report delved into Meese's ties
with the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., an Iraqi pipeline project,
and two other enterprises.
   In filing the report, McKay signaled that he did not have
sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against Meese. But
the report could have become the basis for a separate,
administrative review of Meese's fitness for office.
   Meese told his California news conference he could not bring
himself to resign earlier, because ``to allow myself to be hounded
out of office ... would undermine the system.''
   ``We have been subjected to a barrage of misleading and false
allegations circulated through the media,'' Meese said.
   McKay's report is expected to be issued publicly later in July,
after Meese's lawyers have had an opportunity to prepare a response
to it.
   McKay's office would say only that it anticipated the court
panel would direct that a copy be sent to Meese's attorneys, Nathan
Lewin and James Rocap.
   In April, McKay said that if he decided that no prosecution was
warranted, he would ``refer all of those matters for review and
action by the appropriate administrative authorities.''
   Before Meese's announcement, it was expected that any ethical
questions raised by McKay's office would be referred to the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, a unit which
examines allegations of improper behavior inside the department.
Such a review could result in a recommendation of dismissal by
Reagan.
   At the Justice Department in Washington, spokesman Patrick
Korten said he didn't think the prospect of an OPR examination of
Meese ``was a major factor in resigning.''
   McKay's office, which launched its investigation of Meese on May
11, 1987, had been:
   _Examining Meese's assistance to Wedtech in 1981 and 1982, when
he was White House counselor.
   _Reviewing his actions in connection with a $1 billion proposed
Iraqi oil pipeline project after Meese became attorney general.
   _Delving into the attorney general's meetings with regional Bell
Telephone company executives and his favorable recommendation on
behalf of the firms at a time when he held $14,000 in phone
industry stock.
   _Looking into members of a Washington real estate family
arranging to pay a $40,000-a-year salary for Meese's wife while
leasing office space to the Justice Department.
   Meese's lawyers say their client received no financial benefit
from any of the matters under investigation, that he violated no
conflict-of-interest or other criminal laws and violated no federal
ethical guidelines.
   At Wallach's behest, Meese ordered a White House review that led
ultimately to Wedtech's $32 million, no-bid contract to build small
engines for the Army. Wallach was paid over $1 million by Wedtech
from 1982 to 1986.
   Wallach, interviewed late Tuesday on Cable News Network's ``Lary
King Live,'' said McKay's investigation had yielded ``not a
scintilla of evidence of wrongdoing on Ed's part and, I submit,
therefore, on my part.''
   ``Ed Meese is the consummate lawyer in the best sense of the
word,'' Wallach said. ``He is capable of detaching himself from his
personal involvement to evaluate the facts which are presented
before him.''
   Wallach in 1985 arranged for Meese to enter a financial
partnership with W. Franklyn Chinn, an investment manager who
subsequently became a member of Wedtech's board of directors. Chinn
turned a $40,000 profit for Meese on a $50,000 investment in just
18 months.
   The pipeline portion of McKay's probe involved whether Meese
conspired with Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, Wallach and others to
violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with an
alleged plan to pay bribes to the Israeli Labor Party, to protect
the proposed Iraqi pipeline from military attack. Meese received a
memo from Wallach in September 1985 saying that up to $700 million
would be paid to Israel from the pipeline project, and that ``what
was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is
that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor.'' Meese
says he doesn't recall reading that portion of the memo and his
lawyers say that in any event, the words don't suggest that a bribe
was contemplated.
   In connection with the pipeline, Meese set up a meeting for
Wallach and his client, Rappaport, in June 1985 with then-White
House national security adviser Robert McFarlane.
   The attorney general also sent a letter to then-Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in October 1985 recommending that Peres
discuss the pipeline with McFarlane rather than the State
Department.
   In connection with the telephone stock, Wallach urged Meese in a
memo to get personally involved as attorney general in a
telecommunications matter pending at the Justice Department. After
obtaining a White House waiver allowing him to make a decision
despite his stock holdings, Meese approved a reversal of the
department's position, and asked a federal judge overseeing the
breakup of AT&T to lift most of the restrictions on the types of
business that the regional Bell telephone companies could enter.
   Prior to obtaining the White House waiver, Meese had met with
executives of four of the regional Bell companies which were
seeking the reversal of department policy.

and the designated heir to power urged terrorist attacks on
American targets around the world.
   Tehran radio quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying in letters
to heads of state that Iran has the ``right to avenge the blood of
innocent children, men and women.'' Iran said all 290 people on the
Iran Air flight were killed when the Airbus A300 was shot down
Sunday.
   ``While the U.S. leadership has not yet officially declared its
war against Iran's people, it has, by resorting to this criminal
act, which followed earlier aggressive actions, taken a serious
step toward war with a revolutionary, Islamic nation,'' he said.

   The Iranian airliner shot down by a U.S.
warship in the Persian Gulf was sending radio identification
signals on a military frequency identified with F-14 fighter jets,
leading the American commander to believe he faced attack, a
Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday.
   A six-member investigating team landed Tuesday aboard the
warship, the USS Vincennes, to sort through computer recors
containing conflicting information, including a determination by
another American ship in the Persian Gulf that the Iranian A300
airbus maintained a steady altitude of 12,600 feet rather than
descending from 9,000 feet to 7,000 feet as the Vincennes had
reported.
   Daniel Howard, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that the
Iranian aircraft was broadcasting over a radio transmitter known as
Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) ``in two modes. It was squawking on
Mode-3 ... a common identifier for both military and civilian
aircraft, used in air traffic control.''

   At least two other mix-ups with civilian
planes by U.S. warships occurred in the Persian Gulf air corridor,
one of the world's busiest, before the USS Vincennes shot down an
Iranian airliner, American sources said Tuesday.
   All 290 people on the Airbus 300 were killed when the plane was
hit Sunday. A six-man team of U.S. experts led by an admiral
arrived Tuesday to begin a confidential investigation.
   Dozens of aircraft fly over the gulf each day, many on
long-distance flights between Europe and Asia with stops at Dubai,
Bahrain or Kuwait. The Iran Air jet was on a regularly scheduled
short hop across the Strait of Hormuz from Bandar Abbas to Dubai.
   U.S. officials have said the Vincennes fired two anti-aircraft
missiles at the plane in the mistaken belief it was an Iranian F-14
fighter. Iran says the Navy shot the plane down intentionally.
   A U.S. officer said privately he knew of an incident ``about a
month ago'' in which an airliner thought an American warship was
trying to order it to change course when the ship was talking by
radio to a different plane.

   Pentagon officials acknowledged Tuesday they
are still trying to figure out the effects of a potentially
far-reaching freeze on ``tainted'' contracts announced last week by
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in the weapons-buying
investigation.
   Defense contractors said they remained in the dark about what
Carlucci's action would mean to them and their employees.
   ``We worked that one very quickly and we gave you the best
information we had,'' Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard told
reporters at a briefing that chiefly concerned the downing of an
Iranian airliner by a missile fired by a U.S. warship in the
Persian Gulf.
   But when asked about details of the freeze, such as which
contracts were involved and how long it will last, Howard said, ``I
don't know the answer.''

   When the Democratic National Convention throws
its spotlight on Atlanta, two distinct black communities will share
the stage _ one elite, well-to-do and often associated with
government officials, the other poor and struggling.
   This city, long regarded as a pioneer for black progress and a
center for nearly every aspect of black culture and politics, is
faced with a deteroriating relationship between the two classes of
blacks.
   One source of the problem is that blacks do not control the
economic pursestrings in Atlanta, even though they hold top
political offices, according to Lyndon Wade, executive director of
the Atlanta Urban League.
   ``You cannot run a city with politics alone; you must have an
economic base to make it go. That's why there's a lot of pressure
in the older black community,'' said Wade.
   Tensions between the two classes begin early, according to
Morehouse College sociologist Anna Grant. In school, poor children
start to understand that some of their black classmates enjoy
material advantages inaccessible to them. Since the city's elected
black officials usually are among the elite, the poor come to view
government and the elite as one.

   The Communist Party conference directed formation
of a system of stronger government and individual rights, but
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for a powerful new presidency was
conspicuously absent from documents released Tuesday.
   Resolutions of the four-day conference that ended Friday made no
mention of the powers Gorbachev sought for the presidency and gave
a lukewarm endorsement to his proposal to make local party leaders
head of their areas' legislative bodies.
   The proposed changes could have given Gorbachev significant new
powers as president while he retaining the job of party general
secretary, which now is the single most influential position in the
Soviet Union's system of collective party leadership.
   A high-ranking party official said after the close of the
conference that Gorbachev had won approval for a presidency with
powers to control domestic, international and defense policies.

   Church of England leaders voted Tuesday in favor
of proposals to admit women to the priesthood, despite opposition
from their spiritual head, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
who warned it could split the church.
   The General Synod of bishops, clergy and laity voted 299-216 for
draft legislation allowing the ordination of women. Each group
voted separately: the bishops voted 28-21 in favor; the clergy
voted 137-102; and the laity voted 134-93. There was one abstention.
   But a lengthy process must be followed before the Anglican state
church might get its first woman priest in 1992 or 1993.
   The legislation will be debated and voted upon by all 44 of the
church's dioceses. It then goes back to the General Synod for final
approval and must then by approved by Parliament.
   Runcie had no comment after the four-hour debate at Church House.

   With parties and political shouting matches,
Britain on Tuesday marked the 40th anniversary of its National
Health Service _ a cherished institution of cradle-to-grave care
showing signs of midlife crisis.
   Health authorities threw parties for the nation's first babies
born free on July 5, 1948, the day the post-World War II Labor
Party government's system of socialized medicine took effect.
   Politicians went head on in angry exchanges in Parliament.
Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, shouting above
opposition jeers, denied she is bent on dismantling the cornerstone
of the welfare state.
   Her government, she said, adheres to the principle that ``all
people should have access to the best possible treatment regardless
of their ability to pay.''
   Labor lawmakers recalled with pride the day that a socialist
dream was realized with the setting up by Health Minister Aneurin
Bevan of a service designed to give free health care to every
Briton, rich or poor.

<HEAD>Test-Tube Babies Join Egypt's Population Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While the government seeks to curb
population growth, test-tube baby clinics are springing up in
Egypt, largely because of restrictions imposed by the religion of
Islam on children who are adopted.
   While Moslem religious leaders have not come out in praise of
in-vitro (test-tube) fertilization, they vaguely have approved its
use in strictly controlled situations.
   So, as the government spends almost $60 million a year to curb
population growth, thousands of dollars in private money are spent
by couples who want children.
   ``Overpopulation does not contradict this idea,'' said Hassan
el-Deeb of the Ministry of Health. ``Every wife wants to become a
mother, and 50 or 100 more (people) a year won't affect the
population.''
   Egypt has 54 million people and gets a million new ones every
eight months. It must feed them off just 4 percent of the land
area, the Nile valley. The country imports 60 percent of its grain.
   Religious considerations play a large role in acceptance of the
in-vitro technique, or fertilizing an egg outside the womb in a
test tube for re-implantation.
   Islam has no written laws concerning in-vitro fertilization, but
it is taken for granted that only married couples can use it. And
to date, Egypt has no sperm or embryo banks, nor can women give
birth as surrogates for others, because many clerics and Moslem
doctors say these practices risk adultery.
   To disobey these religious interpretations would have the effect
of removing a doctor's right to practice medicine.
   Under Islamic law, an adopted child cannot be given the foster
parents' name, unless the natural parents are unknown. The adopted
child also lacks the full rights of natural offspring, including
inheritance. Unless the foster parent specifically bequeaths
property to the adopted child in a will, the child gets nothing.
Even with the will, however, the child can receive no more than
one-third of the bequeathed property.
   Couples seeking to avoid those restrictions are resorting to
in-vitro fertilization.
   The ad hoc moral standards regulating in-vitro fertilization are
shared widely by Egypt's Moslems and its 10 percent Christian
minority. But for Moslems, Islamic theologians, known as the ulema,
set down the condition that the in-vitro procedure must be
performed by a Moslem doctor.
   ``Islam requires preservation of family lineage for
inheritance,'' said Sheik Abdallah el-Mashad of al-Azhar Mosque,
the Moslem world's highest center of theological learning.
``Therefore, the doctor carrying out the in-vitro fertilization
must be a trustworthy Moslem believer with a good reputation.''
   As head of al-Azhar's Fatwa Council, which interprets Islam's
holy book, the Koran, el-Mashad is empowered to announce opinions
on controversial matters. The world's Moslems are expected to
follow.
   In Cairo's plush suburb of Heliopolis, Mohammed Fayez, co-owner
of an in-vitro fertilization center, said his team follows
el-Azhar's directions even though they are not legally binding.
   He said the al-Azhar shieks, therefore, give his clinic no
trouble, but it has run into opponents of test-tube baby technology
who ``are afraid the doctors might do something wrong and mix the
specimen. I tell them we can't fully guarantee anything in life.''
   The center is one of three major in-vitro clinics in the capital
area. Fayez said the clinic has achieved two pregnancies among
about 20 patients since it began late last summer.
   He said his clinic charges the equivalent of about $1,450 for
the first two attempts at fertilization, and $975 for the next
three.
   In this Middle Eastern culture typically centered on family
life, childlessness spells problems for a couple. Offspring are
considered necessary to help in the fields, improve the economic
standard of poor families or to keep the wealth of the rich within
the family.
   ``If there is a one percent chance for couples to have their own
they will try. Adoption is not favored,'' said Fayez.

<HEAD>Newark Police Take Issue With New Television Show That Portrays
Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a study in squad-car tedium, the
syndicated series ``The Street'' goes farther than most television
police shows have dared. But some cops on the beat in New Jersey's
largest city say it still misses the mark.
   Most Newark police officers interviewed recently found something
to like about ``The Street.''
   But all had criticisms of the program, which strives for gritty
realism by following the eight-hour shifts of a pair of two-officer
squads. It is shot on videotape with hand-held cameras, a far cry
from the glamorous feature-film style of shows such as ``Miami
Vice.''
   ``It's cheaply made and that takes away from the setting as a
whole,'' said Sgt. Mitchell McGuire. ``It's giving the general
connotation that all Newark policemen have problems.''
   Donald Gabriel found the show to be a slow but not necessarily
inaccurate portrait of his job.
   ``The truth is boring,'' said Gabriel, a patrolman for 25 years.
``It (the show) is great for the truth but not for people waiting
for the action to happen.''
   ``The Street'' is carried by stations in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Detroit and Hartford, Conn., and by
WWOR-TV, a station in Secaucus, N.J., that serves the New York area
but also is seen on cable in 166 markets across the country.
   WWOR-TV officials say talks about prolonging the series are
under discussion, but no decision has been made. The station plans
to run the series at least through the summer.
   ``The Street'' tried to be different from the start, according
to creators Dan Pyne and John Mankiewicz.
   Mankiewicz, who rode with officers to get a feel for the
environment, said his intention was not to create a cop show but a
show exploring the characters of people who work as police officers.
   ``A bunch of new shows are trying to be like movies and are not
serving the medium,'' Mankiewicz said. ``It's a tiny little screen.
You should tell small stories.''
   The officers use coarse language, engage in questionable on-duty
behavior and constantly discuss personal problems.
   ``It gives the feeling that the average Newark policeman is full
of problems and needs counseling,'' said Detective Gary Prystauk.
   Most of the relatively infrequent action is low-key, the result
of budget constraints and the writers' intent, Pyne said. The
producers declined to discuss how much is spent per show, but
Mankiewicz said, ``We can make a show for less than Don Johnson
gets for `Miami Vice.'''
   ``There is a lot of time that cops spend in their car not doing
anything,'' Pyne said. ``Both John and I worked on `Miami Vice,'
where there is a lot of action. It's so hyper-real. Every week they
are killing people. This happens to cops maybe three times in their
career.
   ``We were interested in exploring the men and what goes on in
their mind, and this endless routine of dealing with mundane
crime,'' Pyne said.
   But officers interviewed from the 1,060-member force said their
tours were not as relentlessly banal as those in ``The Street.''
   Detective Fred Carter believes the show is more a flawed
personality study than a look at the real ``street.''
   ``You have to show the `street' part of it,'' said Carter.
``Some days you'll deliver a baby or see someone crying and hungry.
And then you have to go home.''
   Carter and other officers say they did find authenticity in the
show's dialogue between officers.
   ``I think it's pretty good,'' said Robert Wise, a patrolman in
the city's South District. ``It shows that we have problems and
we're trying to help people with their problems.''

<HEAD>Legless Vietnam Vet Bob Wieland Wins Favor on `Sonny Spoon'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bob Wieland, a legless Vietnam veteran, said
some people were skeptical when he began work on NBC's ``Sonny
Spoon,'' thinking he might be there just as window dressing.
   Wieland, 41, a former medic, lost his legs to a booby trap while
trying to save a buddy. He plays Johnny Skates, a sidewalk surfer
and street-smart informant who helps private detective Sonny Spoon,
played by Mario Van Peebles in the tongue-in-cheek detective show.
   ``The first day this big guy was chasing Sonny, and I threw out
my skateboard and knocked him down,'' Wieland said. ``I came out
like a jaguar and hit him with a body roll. It took all the fight
out of the guy. They couldn't believe it. After that nobody
wondered what I was doing on the show.''
   Wieland had never acted until ``Sonny Spoon'' and said he nearly
turned down the role.
   ``I heard NBC was looking for a double-amputee who was
athletic,'' he said. ``I qualified for that. But I had to read for
executive producer Stephen Cannell and see if I hit it off with
Mario. After I got the job and received the first script I looked
at it and it said I was `a legless derelict panhandler.'
   ``I called the producers and said I wouldn't do that. I've been
promoting a positive image since I came back from Vietnam. They
told me that was the way Johnny Skates was written until they hired
me. They said from now on they'd write it around Bob Wieland and my
personality. Now, Johnny Skates is a guy who ends up protecting the
able-bodied.''
   A superb athlete, Wieland was about to try out as a pitcher for
the Philadelphia Phillies until he enlisted in the Army 20 years
ago. The Minnesota Twins and New York Mets were also interested in
the 6-foot-4, 205-pounder from the University of Wisconsin at La
Crosse.
   In 1977, he broke the official world record for the bench press,
lifting 303 pounds with a body weight of 122 pounds.
   He raised $315,000 for charities with his ``Walk for Hunger''
across the United States in 1982-86. He's also competed in the New
York Marathon, finishing four days after the start. He propels
himself on padded hands, lifting his body up and forward.
   He plans to compete in the Ironman Triathalon in Hawaii, in
which he will have to swim 2.4 miles in the ocean, cycle 112 miles
and run a marathon of 26 miles, 385 yards.
   He was named U.S. Track Athlete of the Year in ceremonies at the
Pro Bowl in Honolulu this past February. Both People magazine and
Reader's Digest named him a living American hero.
   When he's not acting, Wieland earns his living making
inspirational talks around the country.
   ``I help people to set goals and objectives and overcome
obstacles,'' he said. ``I visit a lot of high schools. I spend the
whole day with the kids. I cap it off by going to one of their
games at night. I kid that I'm good for about two extra touchdowns.
I say that one high school with a belief is better than 99 schools
with only an interest.''
   Wieland said that handicapped is a word that's not in his
vocabulary.
   ``I didn't know I was handicapped until one of my neighbors told
me I was,'' he said. ``I was mowing the grass. I'd push the lawn
mower, then roll my wheelchair, then push the lawn mower, then roll
my wheelchair. My neighbor leaned over the fence and told me I
shouldn't be mowing the lawn. He said I was handicapped.
   ``I told him I didn't have any choice, I had to mow the lawn. He
asked me what I meant, and I said my wife told me I'd better mow
the lawn or else.''
   Wieland has been married for 10 years to dancer-actress Jackey
Wieland.
   He has a video due out this month called ``Bob Wieland: A Real
American Hero,'' and his biography, ``One Step at a Time,'' will be
published next year.

<HEAD>Fallen from No. 1 Spot in China, Shanghai Finds Comeback is Hard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHANGHAI, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shanghai doesn't look like a city in a
slump.
   It's streets are alive with well-dressed shoppers. Its
commercial lifeline, the Huangpu River, is jammed with freighters
and fishing craft.
   The Bund, the riverfront avenue lined with massive banks and
hotels built by European traders early in the century, remains a
symbol of Shanghai's longtime status as China's commercial and
industrial capital.
   But the city of 12 million people lost its position as China's
No. 1 industrial power in 1985 to neighboring Jiangsu province. It
lost its rank as the No. 1 export earner to southern Guangdong
province, which benefits from being next door to Hong Kong.
   Shanghai's revenues have fallen steadily for the past three
years, and worker productivity also has dropped. Industry grew 6.8
percent last year, well behind the national pace of 16.5 percent.
   Roads, sewers and water pipes built early in the century are
inadequate for present needs. Its industrial technology is outdated
and half the housing predates the 1949 communist takeover.
   Just one telephone is available for every 63 residents; it can
take hours to get a line to call across town.
   Shanghai's planners and business leaders also have not been
agile enough to keep up with China's shift from central planning
and insularity to freer markets, competition and growing trade.
   Jiangsu province and Canton, the capital of Guangdong province,
took advantage of the new policies after 1978 to set up thousands
of small, trade-oriented enterprises.
   Shanghai, bastion of centrally controlled heavy industry,
remained mired in the old system with the state making production
decisions and acting as trade go-between.
   Yang Zhihua, deputy director of the city Planning Commission,
noted in an interview that Shanghai's gross production of goods and
services is still No. 1 nationally, at the yuan equivalent of $14
billion, and that hundreds of Shanghai's products, from steel to
toothpaste, dominate domestic markets.
   ``We're not lagging behind in everything, just in some things,
such as exports and absorption of foreign investment,'' he said.
``We can easily catch up.''
   But the city's performance in the past two years indicate that
might not be easy. In early 1986, city leaders announced plans for
a subway, a new airport terminal, a new railroad station, a tunnel
and other projects to stimulate growth and attract foreign business.
   Only the rail station has been completed. The subway is stalled
by red tape and scarce funds, leaving Shanghai's 15,000 buses and
taxis to carry more than 15 million riders a day through narrow
streets where traffic crawls at a norm of less than five miles an
hour.
   A year-end city report said the problems in housing, traffic
congestion and pollution were acute.
   ``The reason lies in our thinking,'' Yang said. ``We were used
to the past planned economic model.''
   Three-fourths of Shanghai's factories are owned and controlled
by the central government in Beijing. Bloated workers and dependent
upon the state for bailouts, they have not kept up with China's new
atmosphere of competition.
   Central planning also has forced Shanghai to give most of its
revenue to Beijing, retaining little for itself. Its annual
contribution to Beijing of more than $2.7 billion is 10 times that
of Guangdong, which has less state-owned industry.
   ``The central government owes Shanghai a big debt,'' said a
local economist, Zhou Jianming.
   Mayor Zhu Rongji took office in April determined to reverse
Shanghai's decline.
   He speaks fluent English and has a salesman's manner. At a
recent trade conference in Beijing, he assured nearly 1,000
American businessmen they will be able to repatriate profits if
they invest in Shanghai, promising in English, ``No matter how much
money foreign investors make in Shanghai, we won't be jealous.''
   The audience, after listening to jargon-larded translations of
Chinese-language speeches by other officials, laughed and applauded.
   Zhu's plan calls for attracting billions of U.S. dollars in
foreign investment and borrowing millions more to revive the
infrastructure projects and import updated technology.
   He has formed a commission with himself as chairman to
investigate ways of attracting capital and simplifying investment
procedures.
   Shanghai's state-owned factories also have begun slowly to adapt
to new economic realities. Seven television and electronics
factories recently formed their own export corporation to increase
foreign sales.
   Shanghai also is trying to catch some of the rough-and-tumble
enterpreneurial spirit that has worked so well in Canton and the
rest of Guangdong, which racked up a 17 percent growth rate last
year.
   ``Shanghai follows the (state) regulations,'' Yang said. ``In
Canton, they don't worry about the regulations.''

<HEAD>U.S. a Debtor Nation? Really?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a strange twist of logic, the United States
is sometimes referred to these days as a debtor nation, attended by
all the negative implications that go with such a categorization.
   The popularity of the debtor thesis arises mainly from
statistics that show the value of foreign-held assets in the United
States now exceeds the value of U.S. assets held abroad.
   The official figures verify the situation. In 1987, Americans
were said to own $1.1 trillion of foreign assets, whereas
foreigners were credited with owning about $1.5 trillion worth of
the United States.
   But, say critics of such thinking, so what!
   Before lamenting the passing of a great financial power, the
critics say, an application of reason might reveal that what is
suggested as an American weakness may very well be strength instead.
   Their contention is that foreigners should indeed be attracted
to U.S. assets, since such assets are a solid investment providing
a good return in the most politically stable large nation on earth.
   In short: That foreign money isn't lent to desperate Americans
so much as it is invested in attractive holdings. It isn't money
begged to avert disaster; it is money attracted by good prospects
and rates of return.
   At any rate, says William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the debtor nation idea does not ``comport with accepted
notions of what debtor status means.''
   He points out, for example, that a common definition of a debtor
is that of an entity having negative net worth, owing more in
liabilities than is owned in assets. Profligate as he is, Uncle Sam
doesn't fit the definition.
   MacReynolds comments that all U.S. assets, including corporate
equity and bonds, government obligations, real estate, bank assets
and more, amount to $30 trillion. Of that foreigners, owned but 5.6
percent.
   He offers still another method of looking at the so-called
burden: Compare it with a year's worth of income. By that test, he
says, one year's U.S. income is more than enough to buy out all
foreign assets owners at once.
   That eventuality, of course, is implausible. More realistically,
only a small portion of U.S. income, measured by gross national
product, is needed to satisfy foreign asset holders in the form of
an annual rate of return.
   Remember, what is called debt is really investment. And
investors, foreign and domestic, expect only a certain annual
percentage _ a rate of return _ rather than the entire amount at
once.
   Besides, says MacReynolds, who is director of financial and
monetary affairs for the Chamber, even if the popular but spurious
definition of debtor nation is used, the United States still might
come out on top.
   Officially, the United States held $1.1 trillion of foreign
assets at the end of 1987, or considerably less than the estimated
$1.5 trillion of U.S. assets held by foreigners.
   But, says MacReynolds, something doesn't add up. He asks how it
could be that U.S. investors abroad should earn $6 billion more
than foreigners earned here.
   His guess is that the total of foreign assets held by Americans
is greatly undervalued. Rather than the reported $1.1 trillion, he
says, such assets should be valued at more than $1.5 trillion.

<HEAD>Thatcher's Elimination of Tenure Leaves Professors in Outrage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE APPLEBAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
hopes to put an end to the time-honored tradition of tenure in
British universities and it has left many academics in outrage.
   Tenure is the guarantee of lifetime employment for university
professors who are accorded it, but it is to be eliminated this
summer by the government's controversial Education Reform Bill, now
completing a stormy passage through Parliament.
   Tenure dates back to medieval times, and it is a tradition that
has carried over to American universities.
   The Education Reform Bill has upset many professors who content
that tenure protects them from being fired for airing unpopular
ideas.
   The government argues that British universities are failing to
match international research standards and that by removing tenure,
it can force unproductive academics to make way for younger
scholars and infuse the universities with a new competitive spirit.
   The new rules, to apply to all faculty appointed after Nov. 20,
1987, will empower special government commissioners to remove all
tenure guarantees from university charters.
   Mrs. Thatcher and the academics have been at loggerheads for
years over her attempts to reform the funding of universities. In
1984 Oxford University took the unprecedented step of refusing to
give her the honorary degree traditionally accorded to every prime
minister as a protest of her funding cutbacks.
   Both sides recognize that Britain is losing prominent scholars
to American universities. But while the academics say cuts in
government spending are to blame, the government argues that what
it calls largely tenured deadwood is draining away money and
clogging up the system.
   The government's education spokesman, Andrew Opie, said half of
Britain's universities offer tenure, making it impossible to impose
layoffs. This, he added, ``makes it difficult for universities to
meet changing patterns of teaching and research and to dismiss
incompetent staff.''
   Professor Elie Kedourie, head of the political science
department at the London School of Economics, says abolishing
tenure ``will make British universities into something very second
rate.''
   Although a Thatcher supporter, Kedourie fears that the
elimination of tenure, plus other changes in the Education Bill
regarding university funding, will enable the government to siphon
money to profitable studies at the expense of liberal arts
departments, whose untenured staff will then lose their jobs.
   He finds it ``very ironic'' that a government deeply committed
to free markets is being so interventionist on education.
   ``This notion of competitiveness has been very important when
dealing with economics, but universities are educational
establishments,'' he said in an interview.
   The House of Lords, the unelected upper house of Parliament, has
forced amendments into the bill guaranteeing academic freedom and
prohibiting universities from replacing senior academics with
younger, lower-paid professors solely for cost-cutting purposes.
   But critics aren't satisfied. They say the amendments can easily
be overturned in the elected House of Commons and argue that the
commitments are no substitute for centuries-old guarantees written
into university charters.
   The debate has even spread to the United States.
   ``Without tenure scholars and teachers are ultimately subject to
outside control and thus are not free to seek and teach the truth
as they understand it,'' Julius Getman, president of the American
Association of University professors, wrote in a letter to The
Times of London.
   An American association spokesman, Robert Kreiser, said in a
telephone interview that the British government can more easily
force change on universities than the U.S. government could,
because the British institutions are more dependent on government
funding.
   He said no U.S. government could abolish tenure in the United
States.
   ``Every study that has ever been done has come to the conclusion
that the alternatives to tenure are far less attractive,'' he said.
   Unlike American academics who must wait up to 15 years for
tenure, the average British academic gets it almost immediately
after completing his Ph.D. dissertation.
   But while top American salaries move into the six-digit range,
British salaries start at 9,000 pounds ($15,300) a year and rise
according to a national pay scale to a top level of 26,000 pounds
($44,200) for a senior department head.
   Norman Stone, professor of Modern History at Oxford University,
sees nothing wrong with government intervention in higher
education, saying it has been going on for centuries.
   ``There was terrible trouble over this thing in the 16th century
when Erasmus (the Dutch philosopher) wanted to start teaching Latin
and Greek at Cambridge, and again in the 18th century when
reformers wanted to switch Oxford and Cambridge out of theology and
the like and into things like medicine,'' Stone said in an
interview.

<HEAD>Norway and Sweden Seek to Halt Influx of Chileans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish and Norwegian authorities are
taking steps to halt an influx into their countries of Chileans
seeking work and a better life. They say many arrive with forged
documents in an effort to support their claims for political asylum.
   ``A few hundred Chileans a year came to Sweden at the beginning
of the 1980's,'' said Mats Baurmann, a Swedish immigration
official. ``Last year 4,000 applied for political asylum. Most of
them came for economic reasons.''
   Economic reasons are not enough for an alien to stay in Sweden
or Norway, whose officials are concerned that their liberal refugee
policies are being abused.
   The problem also involves nationalities other than Chileans, but
it is particularly acute among Chileans wanting to join the 17,000
other Chileans who have immigrated as long ago as 1973 when Gen.
Augusto Pinochet took power at the head of a military government in
Santiago.
   About 18,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden last year.
About 14,000 were accepted, but most of their applications had been
pending for at least a year. Altogether Sweden had 37,000
immigrants in 1987, said the goverment's Immigration Agency.
   The Swedish government reportedly is considering tightening its
immigration laws, similar to legislation adopted by Norway in June
requiring all visiting Chileans, starting July 1, to obtain entry
visas in advance of arrival.
   Norwegian officials, rejecting claims that their move reflected
a wave of anti-immigration sentiment among voters, said they wanted
only to sift out actual political refugees from the growing tide of
people seeking to improve their economic well being.
   Annette Thomessen, head of the Norwegian Organization for Asylum
Seekers, said in Oslo that she supported the new regulations.
   She claimed that some travel agents in Chile promise jobs and
housing to those who buy tickets to Norway.
   ``But when they arrive here they get nothing,'' she said.
``Instead they are sent back deeply in debt.''
   Neighboring Denmark, which also has a relaxed immigration
policy, has registered no significant increase of requests for
asylum from Chileans, a Justice Ministry spokesman in Cophenhagen
said.
   Baurmann, the Swedish official, said most of the Chilean
applicants come from poor areas of their country. They borrow from
banks or from relatives to pay the return ticket, which they need
to enter Sweden without a visa, he added.
   ``They arrive saying they are tourists, but after a while they
apply for political asylum,'' Baurmann told The Associated Press.
   Baurmann confirmed Swedish press reports that a would-be
immigrant can buy a forged document in Chile that testifies that he
or she is a victim of political persecution. The documents usually
bear the signature of a purported priest, politician or human
rights representative, he said.
   The Dagens Nyheter newspaper quoted Luis Bork, the head of the
Human Rights Commission in the Chilean city of Valparaiso, as
saying: ``I have seen my name on more than 200 forged documents.
   ``We categorically oppose this kind of exile. People should stay
here and fight for democracy. Only if the person is threatened by
jail or death do we help.''
   Baurmann said most documents presented by Chileans are authentic
but are signed by people without authority or credibility.
   Swedish authorities ``do not deny that there is political
oppression in Chile,'' but Sweden's rules must be tightened, he
said.
   About 65 percent of the Chileans coming to Sweden are allowed to
stay, even though many are rejected for asylum, he said.
   Processing an application can take up to two years, while living
expenses are paid by the government. Even if an applicant is denied
asylum, ``many of them get rooted in Sweden'' and eventually are
allowed to stay, said Baurmann.
   Anita Doratio, head of the Swedish Organizations for Asylum
Seekers told the national radio that it would be ``cynical'' to
tighten the rules.
   She argued that Swedes were not turned away when poverty forced
1 million of them to emigrate to the United States 100 years ago.

   An old gag has it that Unitarian Universalists
believe in ``one God, at most.''
   ``There's truth in that,'' says the Rev. William F. Schultz, the
affable president of the distinctively open-minded denomination.
   `Some say God is everything, in the bushes and stars, and some
say he's not at all.''
   In fact, he adds, it's basically impossible to say just what
beliefs the historically influential church holds, and that is one
of the big challenges it faces.
   ``We've always been creedless,'' he said in an interview.
``We've always tried to be open to all sources of inspiration and
not limited to any forms of it.
   ``While we've been global in our loyalities, we have not been
effective in articulating a clear message that all Unitarian
Universalists could affirm. That's one of our central tasks.''
   While relatively small, but with a recently growing membership
of 179,000, the denomination has been at the forefront of such
social causes as racial justice, women's rights, sheltering
refugees and peace.
   But with its wide-open religious perspective, the church has had
a hard time specifying just what it believes. For example, Shultz
offered mixed answers when asked if members hold such traditional
religious beliefs as these:
   Q: Do they believe in a God who cares about each person?
   A: A few would. The majority would not believe in that kind of
personal God.
   Q: Life hereafter?
   A: Most would not believe in a traditional hereafter. Perhaps a
third would say they simply don't know. Some would say the
scientific studies of death and dying point to some kind of
on-going existence.
   Q. Did God create the universe?
   A. Some would say the universe had no discreet beginning, that
it always existed, that it was not God-created. Few call God an
individual, and most would say forces of evolution brought it into
being.
   Schultz, 38, a relaxed, genial Pennsylvanian with neatly trimmed
beard and merry eyes, was elected to his post in 1985, one of the
youngest heads of an American denomination.
   The Unitarian Universalist Association, headquartered in Boston,
draws on all major religions in its teachings _ Buddhism, Hinduism,
Islam, Judaism, Christianity and others, along with their different
Scriptures.
   While the denomination encompasses all that variety of beliefs,
along with humanism, Schultz said its membership generally affirms
several broad concepts that are characteristic, namely:
   _ That history and the future are in human hands, an entirely
human responsibility, and ``we do not believe in a God or fate that
controls it.''
   _ That there is no ``supernatural'' separate from nature, that
``the natural world is interconnected and everything in the
universe is dependent on everything else.''
   _ ``We do not believe that blessings come from the miraculous,
but that they are hidden in the everyday, in the ordinary. To find
the face of God, the emergence of the holy, look to the ordinary,
the everyday.''
   Yet even using those words such as ``God'' and ``holy'' is not
altogether acceptable to members, he said. ``To some, those terms
are great. But they're anathema to others.''
   He uses them, he said, ``because they have some residual
meaning.''
   A minority wing, called the the Unitarian Universalist Christian
Fellowship, works to get the denomination to identify clearly with
Jesus as its central figure of guidance, publishing such needling
questions as:
   ``So you want to be a Christian, but your church isn't?''
   Schultz estimates that elmement makes up about 10 percent of
members. He says the denomination honors Jesus as a ``model for
living'' but not as divine. Other churches consider him both human
and divine.
   Under Schultz' leadership, the church has had a growth rate of 1
to 2 percent a year, the membership climbing from a low of 166,000
at the end of the 1970's to its present 179,000.
   He was born into the church, but he said few are, only about 10
percent. About 90 percent were raised in other faiths, 23 percent
ex-Catholics, 17 percent ex-Methodists, a third ex-Jews.
   Many are drawn into the church through interfaith marriages
between Christians and Jews, he said. He estimated 20 to 25 percent
are agnostics or atheists, while the rest ``are comfortable with
the word, God.''
   ``Most do not believe in the kind of God that controls events in
this world, or that you can talk to,'' he said.
   ``Most would identify God ... as the ground of all being, the
sources of creativity and blessings, the pattern of evolutionary
forces in the universe that move life along developmental paths.
   ``Some would identify him as all nature, identifical with
evolutionary forces. Some would see him as the force of inspiration
to love, the ideals to which we aspire, as that on which we are
dependent, as love and wholeness.''

   More than 400 plans exist among various
Christian organizations to evangelize the world by the end of this
century, says a key figure in steps to coordinate the efforts.
   The Rev. Thomas Wang, steering committee chairman of a
consultation planned by the different groups for next January, says
many of such past efforts have failed because of disorganization,
isolation and competition.
   ``What's happening now is very different,'' he said at a program
committee meeting at headquarters of one of the major groups, the
Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board, to plan an agenda for the
world consultation.
   ``All of a sudden it seems many of God's servants all over the
world have begun to take the end of this century, not as a magical
number, but as a target, a goal, a stimulation for world
evangelism,'' he said.
   ``There has never been an age in the history of the church that
is more qualified to tackle this task of world evangelization in
terms of manpower, resources, technology, communications and
transportation.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When the Democrats gather in Atlanta in mid-July
to anoint Michael Dukakis, there'll be time for remembrance of
political battles past. Not many will look back in fondness,
however, to that other convention two decades ago when the party
tore itself apart in Chicago and demonstrators' heads were split in
the city's streets, all under the eyes of national television.

   It was the last week of August 1968. It was the
Democratic National Convention. It was a mismatch of epic
proportions, and it was being televised live.
   Some five months earlier, Lyndon Baines Johnson had announced he
would not seek nor accept his party's nomination _ the president's
plummeting popularity another casualty of the Vietnam war.
   Four days later, on April 4, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot to
death in Memphis, igniting big city ghettos across America.
   A month after that, Bobby Kennedy was shot in the head while
walking through a California hotel hours after winning that state's
primary. He died the next day.
   And in the heat of late summer, pacifists, anarchists and
hedonists, hippies, Yippies, poets and mystics, delegates,
Dixiecrats and bureaucrats swelled the streets of Chicago each day
_ each with designs on the convention and all certain they could
cure what ailed America.
   Each night, those who had learned to live with the war bunkered
in the luxurious hotels along Michigan Avenue, where they might
hear Dixiecrat Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia espouse the dangers of
letting misinformed socialists and power-mad politicians take over
the party.
   Those who opposed the war bivouacked in the city's lakefront
parks, where they could listen to Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman
promote the politics of confrontation, beat generation poet Allen
Ginsberg chant Hindu hymns, or folk singer Phil Ochs remind them,
``It's always the old who lead us to war; it's always the young who
fall.''
   And before the week was out, each camp would command center
stage in the drama that reached into living rooms across the nation.
   Twenty years later, there are still reminders of the Democratic
Party's brief flirtation with anarchy. The New York Times commented
in mid-June: ``This is a party that ... has been quite willing to
destroy itself to thrash out the most divisive issues that the
country faced, among them civil rights and the war in Vietnam.''
   And among consequences of '68 were far-reaching reforms that in
effect broke the power of old-line party bosses, devised new ways
in its nominating procedures and kept the White House in Republican
hands in three of four elections.
   ``It was a tragic year for the Democratic Party and for
responsible politics in a way,'' recalls former Minnesota Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, a presidential aspirant and principal in the
events of 1968.
   ``There were already forces at work that might have torn the
party apart anyway _ the growing women's movement, the growing
demands for greater racial equality, an inability to incorporate
all the demands of a new generation.
   ``But in 1968, the party became a kind of unrelated bloc of
factions ... each refusing accommodation with another, each wanting
control at the expense of all the others,'' says McCarthy, who now
lives in Virginia and is putting the finishing touches on his 12th
book of essays, ``Required Reading.''

   ``Nobody,'' growled Richard J. Daley, Chicago's bull-tempered
mayor, ``is going to take over this city.''
   But as darkness fell Wednesday, Aug. 28, with three days of
skirmishing already behind them, thousands of would-be
revolutionaries tried to take the streets in front of the Conrad
Hilton Hotel from who-knows-how-many cops wielding 75-cent night
sticks.

   The hotel's aging facade reflected the eerie glow of television
lights as line after line of helmeted police officers followed
tear-gas canisters into the crowd, a sky-blue scythe cutting a
blood-red swath.
   ``I remember finding a room high up in the hotel so I could
watch. Thinking back,'' recalled Mike Royko, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist of the Chicago Tribune, ``it's hard to
believe that spasm of, well, silliness, turned out to be a pivotal
point in American history.
   ``That's not to minimize the goals of some of the people in the
anti-war movement. There were people in there with genuine social
consciences, and many were active in the civil rights movement.
   ``But because people saw this on TV, the fight for the
Democratic Party came down to a confrontation between bullheaded
cops and a bunch of nervous, tired kids following leaders who
talked about revolutionary theory and suddenly had everybody paying
attention.
   ``I remember the chant, `The whole world is watching.' Well,
most of America was anyway, and except for Jimmy Carter squeaking
through, they have put Republicans in the White House ever since.''
   From a five-room suite on the Hilton's 25th floor, then Vice
President Hubert Humphrey watched the scene below, his fate already
in the hands of men whose job was to keep the chaos in the streets
from reaching the convention site four miles to the south.
   Humphrey had not won a single one of the 15 party primaries, had
not even entered the campaign until two days after LBJ said he was
getting out.
   Yet everyone who came to Chicago that week _ the supporters of
the dovish McCarthy, the backers of earnest South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern, the idealists who hadn't recovered from Robert
Kennedy's assassination _ knew Humphrey likely would emerge the
candidate.
   In 1968, delegates ran on primary ballots without a stated
preference, and the political professionals _ the governor, the
mayor, the state party chairman _ exercised an inordinate amount of
influence on how the entire delegation voted.
   That enabled Humphrey to court the local heavyweights and come
away with all the delegates in states such as Pennsylvania, which
had given 90 percent of its vote to McCarthy in the ``beauty
contest.''
   It was as crude a display of power as had been seen in many
years, punctuated by the televised sequence of Daley drawing a
finger across his broad neck in a signal to the podium to cut the
microphones as Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff gave his
nominating speech for McGovern and spoke of ``Gestapo tactics in
the streets of Chicago.''
   Soon afterward, those same party professionals delivered
Humphrey's first-ballot nomination with the same sanguine
efficiency police displayed in their 20-minute downtown sweep of
protesters.
   ``I recall seeing (anti-war protest leader David) Dellinger
standing along the curb right in front of the Blackstone Hotel,''
said Deputy Chief of Patrol Carl Dobrich, who served in the Chicago
police task force that night.
   ``He was standing there like a whipped puppy. He was in this
incredibly rumpled suit and was holding a long-stemmed flower _ a
daisy or something. The stem had been broken in the middle and he
looked pathetic. An hour or so before, he'd been a leader ... a
guru or whatever ... and he was going to lead everybody to a new
world.''
   ``Now,'' concluded Dobrich, who was subsequently tried and
acquitted of federal perjury charges stemming from the disturbance,
``he didn't have anyone around him.''
   By the end of the week, 691 demonstrators had been arrested, 200
protesters were treated for injuries, and an estimated 200 others
never sought treatment for their wounds. The police also paid a
price, with 161 injuries.
   Dellinger would spend a good part of the next few years in
Chicago as one of eight defendants charged with inciting violence
at the 1968 convention.
   The Chicago Seven Trial _ Black Panther leader Bobby Seale's
case was quickly severed from the rest _ opened in September 1969
and quickly became one of the most notorious in recent history.
   The defendants and their attorneys were cited for contempt of
court nearly 200 times. They became a cause celebre, their
convictions overturned in 1972 by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, their paths since as divergent as the motives that brought
them together 20 years ago.
   ``I have no regrets about the '60s whatsoever,'' Abbie Hoffman,
who works as a political organizer, said recently.
   ``The only regrets I have is that we didn't do it deeper, make
it last longer.''

   Abe Peck remembers.
   ``I was editor of the Chicago Seed, the old underground
newspaper,'' says Peck, now at Northwestern University's Medill
School of Journalism.
   ``Word was going around the country that the Yippie `Festival of
Life,' or counterconvention, was going to be `groovy,' as they used
to say back then, but those of us here were worried. I was trying
to pass the message that `If you come to Chicago, be sure to wear
some armor in your hair.'''

   Deputy Chief of Patrol Carl Dobrich of the Chicago Police, who
served in the convention's disturbance task force:
   ``It was anarchy in the making. There were some good people,
some sincere people, out there in the parks and streets, but there
were many others who were without any leadership and who were just
looking for trouble....''
   On Wednesday, midway through the convention, ``I heard officers
being dispatched to the band shell area in Grant Park, where the
flag was being taken down and replaced with some kind of Viet Cong
banner. One thing kind of led to another. When the officers moved
in, the demonstrators were gathering around (protest leader) David
Dellinger, looking for instructions.
   ``After that skirmish, Dellinger pulled out of the band shell
area, leading his flock, as it were.''
   Some of the crowd headed for the Hilton.
   ``When we went for the first two to haul them away, they lashed
out at the officers arresting them and kicked them. I got kicked
myself.
   ``Then, everything started flying through the air as they
started throwing things _ rocks, shoes ... everything.
   ``A tray full of dishes came flying out the window of one of the
hotel rooms, but I couldn't see from which floor.
   ``Later, I recall seeing Dellinger standing along the curb right
in front of the Blackstone Hotel. He was standing there like a
whipped puppy. He was in this incredibly rumpled suit and was
holding a long-stemmed flower _ a daisy or something. The stem had
been broken in the middle, and he looked pathetic. An hour or so
before, he'd been a leader ... a guru or whatever ... and he was
going to lead everybody to a new world. Now he didn't have anyone
around him.''
   Dobrich was later acquitted on perjury charges stemming from the
disturbances.

   Photographer Paul Sequiera, a free-lancer who used to work for
the Chicago Daily News:
   ``I took a photo of Lieutenant Dobrich spraying Mace about a
half-hour after the first police charge ... that Wednesday night.
   ``It looks like a smile on his face, but it's really a grimace.
It happened when a line of cops came forward with Dobrich
commanding. A woman had come over ... and was shaking her hand at
the police, obviously incensed at what she'd seen. I wasn't the
target of the Mace, but the picture looks that way.''

   Three-time California Assemblyman Tom Hayden remembers seeing
fellow protest leader Rennie Davis have ``his head split open by
the police while he thought he was trying to calm down or defuse a
potential confrontation at an assembly at the band shell.
   ``Then he was taken away to the hospital, and police came to the
hospital trying to arrest him.
   ``Hospital workers had to hide him and get his head bandaged and
get him into a cab so he could go to an apartment and rest.
   ``Late at night when the demonstrators got from the band shell
to the front of the Hilton, it seemed to be the high point or the
low point... of the weeklong confrontations when they sat down and
the television lights came on and they chanted, `The whole world is
watching.'
   ``I was right there. I was in the group of people that was being
Maced and we backed up and a woman started screaming....
   ``We fell back through the windows of the Haymarket Lounge, and
everyone fell into the Hilton _ and the police came after us
through the broken windows.... It was hard to breathe with the gas
and the Mace... but in any event there was a lot of panic and then
the crowd fell backward ... and everyone fell into the windows.
   ``I guess I wouldn't want to go through those times again.''
   Hayden, Davis, and six others were charged with conspiracy to
incite violence.

   ``It happened late in the evening, during a police charge on
demonstrators, and I spent 36 hours at Henrotin Hospital for
observation of cranial injuries.
   ``I had a helmet and gas mask in the park, but after the police
cleared the park, I turned them over to the driver, who was going

   Newsday columnist Murray Kempton, now 70, was a convention
delegate for McCarthy and was arrested for disorderly conduct
during a march on the last day of the convention:
   ``Looking back, it was a little illogical, marching on an event
I already had a pass to, but we felt at the time that if they had a
few older guys there, it would make things quieter.
   ``The cops were very nice once we got to the police station.
We'd watched some of the earlier violence on monitors from the
convention floor, and some of the younger people I encountered who
had been arrested seemed almost relieved when they finally were in
custody ... it was safer than the streets, I guess.
   ``Like a damned fool, I took a trial instead of copping a plea
on the disorderly conduct charge. I had to go back to Chicago. It
took weeks and nearly bankrupted me. At one point, I had lunch with
the mayor while they were crucifying me upstairs. They finally
fined me $250.''

people any more, but I felt even at the time that it was strange
prosecuting some of the people that I did.
   ``I remember especially prosecuting a very classy group of
people _ 13 of them as I recall _ and wondering why they were in a
courtroom.
   ``I was curious at the time as to why they would have behaved

legal clinic:
   ``I was with a group of pacifists .... We decided to march to

orders that demonstrators had to stay away from the Amphitheatre.
   ``We got there, about a thousand strong, and instead of just
sitting down en masse, which we should have done, we decided to
picket all night, so there were only two or three dozen by morning,
when they arrested us easily. It was a very minor sideshow.
   ``My feelings haven't changed that much in the intervening
years. The major convention demonstrations set the tone _ I think
the wrong one _ for the next few years of protest. They contributed
to a lessening in the energy for local organizing.''

   Eugene McCarthy, former U.S. Senator from Minnesota whose
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination had spurred a
number of the demonstrators to come to Chicago, although he urged
them to stay away:
   ``I was fairly insulated from the actual violence, but I saw a
lot of the aftermath when they brought the wounded in from the
fighting outside the hotel. They set up a temporary hospital in the
Hilton. The Hilton charged us for the sheets that were used to make
bandages.''
   Later in the week, the McCarthy headquarters on the hotel's 15th
floor were raided by police, and some of the campaign workers were
beaten.
   ``Mainly, they routed people out of bed. I was in my suite on
the 23rd floor when I heard what was happening. A girl was standing
on a landing, very upset, and she said to me: `I don't know why
they did this. We were playing bridge, and I had a 21-point hand!'
''
   McCarthy says he had intended to leave Chicago on Friday, but
the Secret Service warned him not to.
   ``They told me (Chicago Mayor Richard) Daley intended to arrest
everyone with McCarthy credentials once I had left. I stayed on
another day, and we managed to sneak almost all of my people out of
Chicago before I left.
   ``When my plane was taking off from Midway Airport on Saturday,
our pilot got on the loudspeaker and said, `We're now leaving
Prague!'''

   Mitch Kuhn leafs through one of his bound
collections of political buttons, pauses at a page of peace-symbol
pins and reaches 20 years into his memory for a black-and-white
image from August 1968.
   ``I was a peace activist in Milwaukee,'' Kuhn says. ``I had
worked for (Sen. Eugene) McCarthy. And when I saw on television the
McCarthy folks being rousted out of their rooms at the Hilton and
beaten and bloodied _ that goes right to the bottom of your soul.
   ``In hindsight, looking back, I wish I'd have been here.''
   Here: Chicago, 1968, when in the last week of August, thousands
of angry young anti-war protesters upstaged the Democratic National
Convention and the nomination of Hubert Humphrey with violent,
nationally televised clashes with police in the parks and on the
streets.
   Those who were there may remember the stinging tear gas, the
crackling megaphones or the sight of an enraged Mayor Richard J.
Daley leaping to his feet on the convention floor at Connecticut
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff's denunciation of ``Gestapo tactics in the
streets of Chicago.''
   But for those who were not there, the artifacts remain. And for
reasons both economic and emotional, prices for '68 convention
collectibles have risen dramatically.
   Certain Humphrey campaign buttons are worth $150, more than 10
times their book value just 10 years ago. Copies of the Seed,
Chicago's leading underground newspaper of the day, have doubled in
price in less than five years and now sell for about $10 at
rare-book stores.
   As in any market, scarcity increases value. Clean, documented
20-year-old buttons bearing the once-ubiquitous peace symbol go for
$2. But several buttons designed by cartoonist Jules Feiffer to
help raise money to defend the Chicago Seven protest leaders,
charged with conspiracy to incite violence at the convention, go
from $5 to $12.50, depending on their condition.
   Books of the era also are in demand, says Kenan Heise, who owns
Chicago Historical Bookworks in suburban Evanston.
   Typical buyers are people in their late 30s and 40s who shared
the rebellious spirit of the times and yearn for something more
tangible than their memories, says Heise, who recently added a
shelf of out-of-print books by the Chicago Seven.
   ``Trial'' by Tom Hayden, published in 1970 at $1.95, sells for
$15. Abbie Hoffman's 1968 paperback ``Revolution for the Hell of
It,'' published at $1.95, goes for $12.50. Listed at $12 are Jerry
Rubin's ``We Are Everywhere'' (``written secretly in the Cook
County Jail and smuggled out,'' according to a cover blurb) or ``Do
It'' (``Read this book stoned!'').
   There also are memorabilia collectors who just like the way the
stuff looks.
   ``One of the best things to come out of the '60s was the
buttons,'' says Jim Norton, 51, of suburban Oak Park, who collects
anti-Vietnam War pins.
   At the spring meeting of the local chapter of the American
Political Items Collectors, a 2,000-member national organization,
Norton pointed out his favorites, circa 1968: an anti-Lyndon
Johnson button inscribed ``LSD not LBJ;'' a black-and-white pin
bearing a sketch of Uncle Sam with a pistol, and a
red-white-and-blue button showing a dove shedding a bloody tear.
   ``My daughter almost cried when she saw that,'' he said.
   The market for Chicago '68 artifacts is broad enough to include
everything from a comic-book-style copy of poet Allen Ginsberg's
testimony at the Chicago Seven trial _ $25 at Heise's store _ to a
Humphrey-Muskie poster, also $25.
   But some items are valued by their owners beyond any price.
Charles ``Sky'' King, 48, worked as a newspaper film courier during
the convention and remembers steering his motorcycle through the
tear gas in Lincoln Park with a photographer standing up behind him
on the passenger foot-pegs, shooting riot scenes.
   His souvenirs include a bright-orange Secret Service pass and
his courier identification card, marking him, he said, as ``a
veteran of the Democratic War.''

   They were left-wing activists whose courtroom
antics and commitment to political change reflected a generation of
angry youths disillusioned by a nation in undeclared war thousands
of miles away.
   The defendants who won national attention in the Chicago Seven
trial are middle-aged and grayer now, one the author of a barbecue
cookbook, another a professional party-giver; many are fathers and
husbands.
   But most remain committed to a watered-down brand of the
activism that made them household names 20 years ago.
   ``A lot of people tell me I'm selling out, because I wrote a
cookbook,'' says former Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, 51, whose
``Barbecuing with Bobby'' was recently published.
   ``I say, `Why do you want to pigeonhole me?''' Seale says. ``I
still believe in revolving political and economic power back to the
hands of the people.''
   Seale and seven others were charged with conspiracy to incite
violence in August 1968 at the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago.
   The 4{-month theatrics featured wild-haired defendants whose
antics included wearing judicial robes to court, taking them off
and stomping on them; and a 74-year-old judge who refused to allow
Seale his own attorney and ordered him bound and gagged in the
courtroom when he protested.
   ``I think it certainly was a microcosm of the times,'' former
defendant John Froines says, ``but it was also theater, so it was
an exaggerated statement of the times as well.
   ``When Abbie Hoffman said that the judge came right out of
central casting, it was true. Instead of them picking a liberal
judge who was very restrained, they picked a very harsh, prejudiced
jurist who in a sense kind of reflected the kind of oppression that
people were ... talking about as being the nature of America at the
time.''
   The case opened in September 1969 and became known as the
Chicago Seven trial when U.S. District Judge Julius Hoffman severed
Seale from the others, convicted him of contempt of court and
sentenced him to four years in prison.
   Five of the other seven defendants _ Rennie Davis, David
Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin _ also were
charged with crossing state lines with intent to riot and were
found guilty in February 1970.
   Froines and Lee Weiner were acquitted. None of the defendants
was convicted of the conspiracy charge.
   The five convictions and Seale's contempt citation later were
overturned by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, citing errors
by Judge Hoffman and criticizing his courtroom demeanor.
   The seven defendants and their attorneys also were cited for
contempt of court nearly 200 times, but all but 15 of the citations
were dismissed.
   In a 1982 interview, a year before his death at age 87, Judge
Hoffman said the defendants had made a mockery of the nation's
highest trial court.
   Most have no regrets about their behavior during the trial.
   ``I was standing up for the Sixth Amendment of the
Constitution,'' Seale says, ``that every citizen has the right to
have legal counsel of his choice.
   ``I never disrupted the courtroom unless my name was mentioned.
`But judge,' I'd say, `you're a racist facist dog, you denied me my
constitutional rights.'''
   Seale, the father of three, now works in minority recruitment at
Temple University in Philadelphia, where he is doing graduate work
in political science and African-American Studies.
   He also works in a program aimed at getting students into
community service and social action.
   ``I've refined my perspective a lot,'' says Seale. ``I stopped
advocating overthrowing the government when the government stopped
trying to overthrow our organization.''
   He plans to use proceeds from his cookbook to fund scholarships
for minority college students.
   Former Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman, one of the brashest of the
defendants during the trial, remains one of the most politically
involved.
   ``I'm an American dissident,'' says Hoffman, now 51 and the
father of three.

   He has made a career out of political protests and has been
arrested numerous times in recent years in demonstrations against
South Africbert E. van Patten, leader of GLOC research at the Armstrong
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson, says
Germans put meters in their Ju-88 dive bombers in World War II to
pull the plane out at low altitudes if the pilot lost consciousness.
   ``All in all, we aren't that far ahead,'' van Patten says.
   Hill says GLOC gained priority again about four years ago when
video cameras were put in cockpits. They captured pilots coming
close to GLOC.
   Susceptible pilots usually have many hours of flying time, but
relatively few hours in very-high performance aircraft. They tend
to be middle-aged and have had little training on the centrifuge,
Hill says.
   ``These profiles very accurately describe our Air Force Reserve
and Air National Guard units that have converted to the F-16,''
Hill says.
   Fatigue also is a big factor, researchers say, which could pose
problems for a pilot flying multiple missions in wartime.
   Beginning in August, the Air Force plans to train about 2,500
pilots per year _ fledglings and veterans _ on a new centrifuge at
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M.
   Part of the training involves exercises that push the blood back
up.
   So does the G-suit, a corset-like garment inflated to keep blood
from pooling in the legs. Soon to come is positive-pressure
breathing that forces air into the lungs and forces a pilot to
exhale.
   But even if a pilot does recover from GLOC, it can take up to
two minutes to regain his bearings. Soking at
ways to tell the airplane's computer that the pilot is unconscious
so the plane can briefly fly itself to safety.
   McDonnell Aircraft Co. says it is near a system that keys on a
pilot's breathing and voice patterns, combined with a computer
memory of recent sharp maneuvers in the plane, to tell when a pilot
is at GLOC risk.
   Van Patten's group is trying more complicated sensors, possibly
in helmets, that would measure head slump, eye blink, blood
pressure, pulse in head arteries and even the grip on the stick.
Those researchers want to use more extensive artificial
intelligence, including neural networks _ computers based on the
architecture of the brain _ to make more accurate judgments.
   A pilot might someday put a computer disc with his own
characteristics on board to tell the computer how to program the
system exactly for him, van Patten says.
   To revive a pilot, researchers are studying ways to pulsate the
G-suit, administering small amounts of carbon dioxide which dilates
blood vessels and raises blood pressure.
   ``Perhaps even plain old smelling salts,'' says van
Patten.``They have a long and honorable history.''
   But most of all, a recent study shows, pilots want a system that
they won't have to attach each time they get into a cockpit and
that they can override if it starts to malfunction.
   Van Patten estimates a simple prototype system could be built
for $500,000, and could be ready to fly by 1993 with another $3
million. But in the current budget climate, he says, money is hard
to come by.

   Although it's technically against the law,
physicians in the Netherlands are tacitly allowed to practice
active euthanasia, putting an end to terminally ill patients' lives
with a lethal injection.
   The practice there is believed to be more widespread than in any
other country. Experts in the field say they know of no country
where active euthanasia is legal.
   ``But does the law wink at it? Yes, it may in some cases,'' says
Daniel Callahan, a noted author and expert on medical ethics who is
the director of the Hastings Center, a research institute in
Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
   Dr. Pieter Admiraal, a Dutch anesthesiologist at General
Hospital in Delft and a supporter of euthanasia, estimated in a
telephone interview that there are about 5,000 cases of euthanasia
a year in a population of 15 million people. Only a handful of
doctors have been prosecuted, and officially only 140 cases were
reported last year, Admiraal says.
   ``Most doctors fill in the form that it was a natural death,''
he says. Admiraal says that in the last 10 years he has helped more
than 100 patients to die. He faced prosecution only once, but the
charges were dropped.
   ``We are the first in the world to do this kind of experiment,''
he says. ``I think it's done in a lot of countries, always secret
and illegal.''
   Admiraal says doctors can be 95 percent sure the state won't
bother them if they follow certain rules.
   ``The patient must ask for euthanasia more than once,'' he says.
``The patient must be in a normal mental state and suffering
unbearably. It must be a disease which we cannot cure. And the
doctor has to have a second opinion.
   ``We discuss the possibility of euthanasia for a week or so, and
we also have to believe it is the only way. We have a whole team
involved in the decision making. We have to agree there is no other
way to do it. It's not something to decide in an afternoon.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Elliott Abrams is a man not given to compromise
or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political
enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy,
where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered.
Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs means
to soldier on until the end of President Reagan's term.

<TEXT>
   Elliott Abrams is Ronald Reagan's point man in
the one area where the president's vaunted good luck seems to have
deserted him.
   On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustained
assault than in Central America _ Abrams' turf _ but Abrams'
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers
Cuban-style communism there haven't gotten very far.
   In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policy
opponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target of
corrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.
   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the
hemisphere, but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries
_ Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and Nicaragua's Sandinista
government _ seem to have misfired.
   The policies Abrams has pursued are no less controversial than
his style. Although he's only 40, few have seen more intellectual
combat than he has.
   Few neutrals emerge when Abrams is the subject of conversation.
A sampling of opinions: He's arrogant. He's brilliant. He's
untrustworthy. He's courageous. He's unscrupulous. He's principled.
   ``I don't like the man,'' says former Ambassador Frank McNeil,
using a stronger noun.
   ``I wish him a long life,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   Abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with
people who disagree with him.
   ``This is a political battlefield,'' he says. ``The opposition
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally
hard.''
   Off duty, the Abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears,
as does the mantle of the no-apologies crusader.
   Dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small
children (on weekends he makes French toast from scratch). Late at
night, he can be found curled up with a novel. But, during working
hours, it's the combat zone.
   The combat zone was livelier than usual during the Iran-Contra
hearings last year. It developed that Abrams had earlier misled
Congressional committees about fund solicitations for the Contras
and U.S. involvement in an ill-fated resupply flight for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   From the Democratic camp came predictable cries for Abrams'
resignation. He didn't oblige.
   Some blame him for the administration's more recent policy
setbacks, accusing him of flawed tactics and an abrasive style that
alienates potential allies. His supporters fault Congress as balky
and shortsighted, ``irresolute'' friends in Latin America, hostile
media, bureaucratic infighting and the intractable nature of the
problems he inherited.
   Abrams is a ``neoconservative.'' He worked for two Democratic
senators _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and the late Henry
Jackson of Washington state _ and, in the 1980 campaign, for the
election of Ronald Reagan. He is a native of New York City and a
product of Harvard.
   Abram's wife, Rachel, is the daughter of Norman Podhoretz,
editor of Commentary magazine, and Midge Decter, a champion of
conservative causes.
   After defecting to the Republican Party, he joined the
administration in 1981, becoming, at age 33, the youngest person
ever with the rank of assistant secretary of state. He has had that
title as head of three bureaus _ international organizations, human
rights and, since 1985, Latin America.
   American aid to the anti-Sandinista cause has been an article of
faith with Abrams. When Congress last February rejected further
military shipments to the Contras, Abrams thought it would
undermine them in negotiations with their foes _ perhaps fatally.
   The next blow came in May, with the collapse of Abrams'
negotiating efforts to induce Noriega's departure. It was
especially pams had seen there a chance to further
democracy in the hemisphere while ridding Panama of a leader who
was under indictment in the United States on drug-dealing charges.

   According to Abrams' script, American diplomatic and economic
pressure, coupled with discontent among the Panamanian people,
would be enough to topple Noriega. It didn't happen. Panama is left
with a wounded economy and Noriega firmly in charge.
   ``Abrams misread Noriega very badly,'' says McNeil, former
ambassador to Costa Rica and one of his more persistent critics.
Abrams' approach regarded Panamanians as ``little brown brothers''
to be pushed around with a little muscle-flexing, he says _
``incredible ineptitude.''
   Abrams' backers contend his hand was weakened by a campaign of
leaks from the Justice Department and the Pentagon to undercut his
grand design. McNeil's suggestion that Noriega's abdication could
best be achieved by a Latin American -led negotiating team is
dismissed as ``balderdash'' by Hyde, one of Abrams' staunchest
supporters.
   Abrams assumed his duties three years ago, determined to try to
overcome what he saw as a decline in American political will and
leverage in Central America. Like Reagan, he was convinced that the
Nicaraguan government, left unchecked, would spread its revolution
and ultimately present national security dangers to the United
States.
   In pursuing his objectives, Abrams was never tongue-tied in
responding to his critics. One congressman's suggestion that the
administration was unconcerned over the murder of four American
churchwomen in El Salvador he called ``not only false, but I would
say malicious and bordering on the vicious.''
   He upbraided another: ``Blame America. Blame America. Never
blame the Communists.''
   Talking with a reporter in his sixth-floor State Department
office, Abrams insists that he doesn't seek confrontation for its
own sake.
   But, he says, ``I have never understood that my function here
was to take the president's views and water them down sufficiently
so that they'd be more popular in Congress.''
   He'd be delighted to solicit bipartisanship, he says, but the
Democratic Party leadership had decided, ``before I got here,''
that this was impossible on Central America.
   It's not just the Democrats, though. He's critical of colleagues
in the administration who, he claims, fail to toe the line in
support of Reagan's policies but tend to accommodate the
president's ideological opponents because they have a personal
agenda stretching beyond the president's tenure: Lucrative jobs in
private business after their government service ends.
   ``I don't think that is why tens of thousands of people worked
their fingers to the bone getting Ronald Reagan elected, so that
guys like me could come to Washington and meet lots of people and
get a good law firm job,'' he says.
   ``We're supposed to pursue policies and if there are people in
the press or in Congress or in so-called human rights groups who
don't like it, too bad.''
   The people who don't like Abrams almost succeeded in dislodging
him from his office.
   ``They had a good shot in June '87,'' Abrams says. ``They almost
got me. They've only had one shot since then, in April when
everybody was blaming me for Panama.''
   June '87 refers to his testimony before the committees
investigating the Iran-Contra affair. In October 1986, Abrams had
denied U.S. government involvement in a Contra resupply flight that
was shot down over Nicaragua, leading to the capture of an American
soldier of fortune.
   Abrams said later he had not been informed that the flight was
part of the Contra aid network created by Lt. Col. Oliver North,
the former National Security Council aide.
   In June 1987, he testified before the congressional committees
investigating the Iran-Contra affair and called his misstatements
``completely honest and completely wrong.''
   In November 1986, Abrams told the Senate Intelligence Committee
that the United States had not asked third countries for money for
the Contras. In fact, as the June hearings brought out, Abrams
himself solicited a $10 million contribution from Brunei, a tiny,
oil-rich sultanate in Southeast Asia.
   He apologized to the committee, explaining that he had promised
Brunei confidentiality, and he admitted his handling of the matter
had been foolish.
   One Democratic representative who is unmollified is George
Crockett of Detroit, who heads the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs. He won't allow Abrams to
testify without swearing him in first, ``so we can at least go
through the motions of trying to believe what he's testifying to.''
   Wayne Smith, a former head of the U.S. diplomatic mission to
Cuba, calls Abrams a man ``willing to lie and misrepresent the
facts about anything.''
   Robert Kagan, a former deputy to Abrams, puts such attacks down
to political differences. ``The liberal
intelligentsia hates Elliott Abrams because he ical and ideologis the most
articulate spokesman for administration policy,'' he says. ``He is
a person of unique personal strength and strength of conviction.''
   Nevertheless there are some people at the White House, too, who
would like to see him replaced, Abrams believes. But enjoying the
full support of Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, he
says he'll stay on board until the president's term is up.
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' he says.

   representing both countries, will make its debut in August with a
monthlong concert swing across the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   ``It's such a great opportunity to make music and travel in the
United States and travel in Russia,'' says Caroline Coade, 20, of
San Diego, Calif.
   Coade, a student of the viola who graduated May 30 from Oberlin
College, is one of 58 Americans and 52 Soviets, ages 17 to 23,
selected for the orchestra. Twelve participants are from Oberlin
College.
   The orchestra will assemble on Oberlin's campus on July 16 for
rehearsals and workshops to acquaint them with each other's social
and cultural traditions.
   The orchestra's opening concert is scheduled for Aug. 5 at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Zubin Mehta,
music director of the New York Philharmonic, will conduct.
   The orchestra grew out of a luncheon attended by Oberlin
President S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Soviet affairs, and
officials of AFS Intercultural Programs, an international exchange
group based in New York, says Grace Kennan Warnecke, the
orchestra's executive director.
   Warnecke, daughter of George F. Kennan, former U.S. ambassador
to the Soviet Union, initiated negotiations with the Soviet
Ministry of Culture last year. She says the idea ``was greeted with
far more enthusiasm on both sides than anticipated ... which is not
to say it still isn't hard.''
   In the Soviet Union, the orchestra will be sponsored by the
Ministry of Culture and Gosconsert.
   Warnecke says a joint orchestra would have been impossible
before glasnost, the new spirit of openness in the Soviet Union,
although separate tours have been permitted.
   ``What's different about this is we're creating a brand new
institution, and that's never happened before,'' says Warneke, who
lived in the Soviet Union periodically as a child and attended
fifth grade in a Soviet school while her father was ambassador.
   She says the orchestra could be ongoing, but efforts are
concentrated on this year's program.
   ``If glasnost becomes a complete success, increasing openness to
the point that we don't need a Soviet-American orchestra ...
(we'll) put ourselves out of business and that's all the better,''
she says.
   The American musicians represent 24 states and were chosen from
some 500 who auditioned either in person or by tape. They are to
receive expenses and a small allowance from foundations who have
agreed to finance the program, according to Warneke.
   While touring the United States, the musicians will stay in
dormitories, private homes or hotels.
   The trip to the Soviet Union is an important element for Claudia
Lasareff-Mironoff, 23, who is studying for a master's degree in
viola at Northwestern University. Her parents left the Soviet Union
as children and emigrated to the United States after World War II.
   ``I think it's really important that we share musical ideas. The
Russian school of string playing is such a famous school. I'm
really excited to be an American string player and to be getting to
share in that,'' says Lasareff-Mironoff, who speaks Russian.
   One of the musicians, Calvin Lewis, 18, of Hephzibah, Ga., who
studies the violin at the Cleveland Institute of Music, says he's
eager to hear the Soviet musicians perform. Lewis says he doesn't
know any Russian but suspects the Soviets will know some English.
   ``Music is a language in itself. I don't think there'll be a
problem,'' says Lewis, who will be making his first trip out of the
country.
   One of the youngest participants will be Junko Kaji, 17, a
junior at Maumee Valley Country Day School in Toledo. She's been
playing the violin since the age of 3 and plays in a youth
orchestra in Toledo.
   Kaji says the tour in the Soviet Union is an opportunity to see
whether her perceptions of that country are valid. ``I thought I
might want to see what the (Soviets) are really like,'' she says.
   During the orchestra's 2{ weeks in Oberlin, they will rehearse
with Larry Rachleff, Oberlin conductor and music director, and
Leonid Nikolaev for the Moscow Conservatory of Music.
   After the opening concert, the musicians will perform in New
York City on Aug. 7; Milwaukee, Aug. 9; San Francisco, Aug. 11 and
Trenton, N.J., Aug. 14. The Soviet tour will open and close with
concerts in Moscow, with four concerts in two other cities in
between.
   The orchestra's repertoire will include works by American and
Russian composers, and the New York performance will include the
world premiere of a symphonic piece by Soviet composer Edison
Denisov.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It started as a backyard picnic. Over the past
42 years it has become a family tradition for a special American
family, the veterans of the famed World War II jungle fighting unit
known as Merrill's Marauders. As one says, ``We're more than
friends.''

   They are old men now, many in their 80s, but they remain as
fierce in their loyalty to one another and to an annual tradition
as they were when they fought and suffered together and earned the
nickname Merrill's Marauders.
   For the 42nd year in a row the graying Marauders will assemble,
this time in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 2-4, to refight the old
battles and talk about Bull-Fight Brandy, a concoction of their own
never approved by the medics, and swap pictures of grandchildren.
   ``I'm sure there will be a few who will attend for the first
time along with those who show up every year,'' says Tom Martini of
Charlotte, this year's reunion chairman.
   ``The difficulty is in getting the word out. With so many moving
to new homes in retirement it's hard to keep a current mailing
list, which was never complete to begin with.
   ``After all these years, some guys arrive and say `I never knew
about it before.'''
   But they have never forgotten the Marauders.
   For six months in 1944, twice as long as the operation had been
originally planned, the Marauders became the stuff of legend. They
fought in five major and 30 minor actions against veteran Japanese
troops behind enemy lines in northern Burma. When their final
objective was taken, their force of 3,200 numbered fewer than 500
who could be classified as effective fighting men.
   ``Yes,'' says Marauder Phil Piazza of Seneca, S.C., ``we were
all volunteers, and, yes, we have discussed at our reunions why we
volunteered.
   ``Why did I? I guess I was a little bit crazy. I was single. I
was anxious to see some action. Don't forget, World War II was not
like the Vietnam War. We had a clear purpose. I wanted to be a part
of it. I think most of the others would tell you just about the
same thing.
   ``It was an experience none of us would want to relive. But it
had to be done, and we would do it again if necessary.''
   They had all responded to a request for volunteers for ``a
hazardous mission somewhere.'' They were never told where. And
there is evidence supporting Piazza's idea that they were men who
actually liked combat.
   In a book about the unit (written in part from material gathered
at a reunion) Marauder Charlton Ogburn, of Beaufort, S.C., recalled
the 1st Battalion commander suggesting, in a lull between battles,
that if nothing else was going to happen they might cross the ridge
and start a fight with 2nd Battalion.
   ``Of course he was joking,'' writes Ogburn, ``but all the same
...the idea had occurred to him.''
   Merrill's Marauder's was the name given by a Time Magazine
reporter to honor their commander, Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill. Their
official designation was 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), which
led one Marauder, under fire, to wonder what the hell had become of
the other 5,306.
   They had come from Army units in the South Pacific, Puerto Rico,
Panama and the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga. Their job was
to cut Japanese communications, hit the enemy from the flank and
rear, and open the strategically important Ledo Road.
   They fought in jungle, never knowing what terror lay beyond the
next bend in the trail, and made famous such forgettable names as
Walawbum, Shaduzup, Nhpum Ga, Inkangatawng and Myitkyina. But they
never forgot.
   They lost 93 killed, 293 wounded and five times that many to
disease. ``In the end,'' wrote the medical historian of the
China-Burma-India theater, ``amoebas, bacteria, rickettsiae and
viruses, rather than Japanese soldiers and guns, vanquished the
most aggressive, bravest and toughest outfit that fought in the Far
East in the Second World War.''
   In the end, Merrill's Marauders won a Presidential Unit
Citation, six Distinguished Service Crosses, four Legions of Merit,
44 Silver Stars and a Bronze Star for every man in the regiment.
Their shoulder patch lives on as the symbol for the 1st Battalion
of the 75th Infantry Ranger Regiment.
   A few years ago a Marauder spotted a decal of the patch on the
window of a car ahead, chased the car for miles along the
Pennsylvania Turnpike, caught up, motioned for the driver to pull
over _ and learned about the reunion.
   Phil Piazza was the one who started the reunion. He was
commander of a heavy weapons company of Blue Combat team of 2nd
Battalion.
   ``We had three battalions, each with two combat teams.
Naturally, nobody in the unit could know all the 3,000 men in the
regiment, but I knew my company and my battalion. I lived in
Bridgeport, Conn., then, and after the war a few of us in the area
would get together from time to time and finally I said to them,
`Why not make it an annual affair?'
   ``We were all back working at new jobs and none of us had any
vacation time accumulated, so we picked Labor Day weekend. We held
the first reunion in my back yard. We worked from a list of
who-knows-where-who-is, and about 75 guys showed up.
   ``Well, Labor Day weekend became the traditional time to hold
it, which makes it difficult for some who have other family plans,
but in recent years we have always had 300 to 400 on hand. That
includes wives and children, and now, grandchildren.''
   Over the years, the generations, the reunion has grown from a
gathering of warriors to a fellowship of families. Some save up all
year for the annual blast.
   ``We've had some wonderful trips,'' says Jean Martini, whose
courtship with Tom included frequent letters to him in Burma.
``We've been to Phoenix, Chicago, Savannah, Charleston, St. Louis,
New York, Boston, Orlando and I can't remember where all. Last year
we went to New Orleans.''
   Romance has blossomed. The widow of a Marauder married a
Marauder widower. The son of a Marauder married the daughter of
another.
   ``We are closer than friends,'' Jean says. ``We are family. It's
a family reunion.''

   TV audiences will soon get their first real
chance to hear pianist Vladimir Feltsman, who emigrated to America
last summer after much publicized difficulties in getting out of
Russia. On Wednesday, July 13, he will perform in a ``Live from
Lincoln Center'' telecast on PBS.
   ``This will be my first purely musical TV event,'' says the
36-year-old Feltsman. ``Playing in the White House (Sept. 27) and
my debut at Carnegie Hall (Nov. 11) were shown on the news, a
little. I was on the `60 Minutes' show. It was more talking than
music.''
   The Mostly Mozart Festival, now in its 22nd year at Avery Fisher
Hall, will open with Feltsman on Tuesday, July 12. The program will
be repeated on Wednesday night and televised live.
   ``Mostly Mozart is one of the leading music festivals in the
world. I am very pleased I have been invited,'' says Feltsman. ``I
will play Mozart's `Piano Concerto in B flat major,' the last by
Mozart. He was composing it at the same time he was composing `The
Magic Flute.' It is an absolute masterpiece.
   ``Then Frederica von Stade will sing something, and then we will
do an aria by Mozart together, so I think it will be fun.''
   Since arriving in America, Feltsman has played 60 performances.
``This season has been very special for me,'' he says, ``because I
am doing everything for the first time _ the first time in
Philadelphia, Israel, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles.''
   Feltsman was considered one of the Soviet Union's best young
pianists when he applied, in April 1979, for an emigration visa.
That year, he says, 52,000 Soviet Jews emigrated. But his
application was denied. Two hours after he applied, Moscow radio
and TV stations were ordered not to play his records. All his
concerts were canceled for two years. Then for the next six years,
Feltsman was allowed to give a few concerts, one such in a factory
where machinery all but drowned out his music.
   On June 14, 1982, Feltsman supporters, who knew him through
recordings and European concerts, scheduled his ``New York debut,''
to publicize his plight. Misha Dichter played that evening.
   Five years later, Feltsman's emigration was approved. Alice
Chandler, president of the State University of New York in New
Paltz, who had looked up Feltsman when she visited Russia,
telephoned to offer him a job. Feltsman, his wife Anna and son
Daniel arrived in New York last August.
   Their 5-year-old son is settled into nursery school and already
finds it easier to speak English than Russian. As for his and his
wife's adjustment, Feltsman says, ``We came here more or less well
prepared. We were not looking for some miracles. We understand that
it is a beautiful country with many problems, which we all know.
   ``Paradise does not exist in the world, as we also know. For
people of my occupation, my mentality, my psychology, my ability,
I'm certain it is still the best place in the world.''
   Feltsman's debut with symphony orchestra was in February with
Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic. ``From then till this
fall I'm playing 10 different concertos and three different recital
programs. It's a little bit tough.''
   In May, Feltsman played a piano sonata by Alfred Schnittke. The
Soviet composer and his wife were allowed to travel to New York for
the occasion. ``This single fact assured me about glasnost much
more than speeches made by Soviet officials,'' he says. ``A few
years ago such a visit of a leading Soviet composer and playing by
a Jewish immigrant was unimaginable. Now it is real. I hope such a
normal attitude will go forward.''
   In addition to his concerts, Feltsman is cutting records and
talking about a special school for budding American pianists. He
has made two recordings already and soon will make two more.
   ``I think recording is one of the most important parts of the
life of a musician,'' he says. ``The performing artist plays, and
it is disappearing in air. Now I'm already thinking, not about
success, but about leaving some legacy.''
   Part of that legacy, too, could be a special program for
promising young American pianists. Of those he's worked with, he
says, ``Their main trouble, even for the best I heard, is their
training at a very early age. If you miss something at 6, 7, 8 or
9, technically, physically, psychologically, you will never get it
back later.''
   Feltsman has talked with some wealthy people about endowing a
school, free but available only to the most gifted.
   ``With such things as music, if you want to get good results you
have to be very tough at the beginning,'' he says. ``And the
principle has to be talent, not ability to pay. You cannot buy a
musical gift with money.''
   Asked whether he'll be nervous about the Mostly Mozart opening
and televised concert, Feltsman says, ``I am very nervous always.
   ``Probably that's the way you have to pay for the joy to play
the music.''

   At dinner two years ago, a friend told David
Henry Hwang a bizarre tale that had made headlines in Europe but
received little attention in the United States.
   A French diplomat falls in love with a Chinese actress in
Beijing. They carry on an affair for 20 years. He later is arrested
in France on espionage charges. At the trial, it is revealed that
the actress is a man who was coerced into the liaison by the
Chinese government. The diplomat claims he didn't know she was a he.
   ``The story had a kind of resonance that appealed to me,'' Hwang
says of what turned into ``M. Butterfly,'' winner of the 1988 Tony
Award as best play of the season. ``So I initially thought of doing
it as a musical.''
   Hwang approached producer Stuart Ostrow who once had brought
Hwang, composer Philip Glass and designer Eiko Ishioka together for
a musical project that didn't pan out.
   Hwang thought about the story for two months and decided to
dovetail the spy drama with the plot of Puccini's ``Madama
Butterfly.'' He sent a two-page outline to Ostrow. It contained the
axis of the plot, particularly the idea of the French man thinking
of himself as Pinkerton and the actress as Butterfly.
   The outline became a play _ written in about six weeks _ rather
than a musical because Hwang didn't want to go through the lengthy
process of finding a composer and lyricist.
   ``I did no research on the story itself because the fact that
the incident existed was enough for me,'' he says. ``I wanted to
interpret it in my own way. Instead, I did a lot of research on the
period _ what type of secrets could have been passed in the early
'60s, the origins of the Vietnam War and what was going on in
China.''
   Before the end of 1986, Ostrow optioned the play for production.
John Dexter, director of ``Equus,'' came aboard in 1987, and a year
was spent casting and raising the $1.2 million needed to bring the
play to New York. When it opened in March 1988 at the Eugene
O'Neill Theater, John Lithgow was starred as the hapless diplomat
and B.D. Wong played the exotic Chinese opera singer.
   ``Broadway always was the goal,'' Hwang says. ``I thought this
was a play that had some commercial potential, but it had never
occurred to me, growing up and working in the non-profit theater,
that you could initiate a production on Broadway.''
   ``M. Butterfly'' is the first Broadway play for the 30-year-old
Hwang, even though he has had extensive credits off-Broadway. He
made his mark there in the early 1980s with plays about
Chinese-Americans such as ``FOB,'' ``The Dance and the Railroad''
and ``Family Devotions.''
   Hwang was raised as a musician, not a writer. His first theater
experiences were playing violin in the pit orchestra for amateur
musicals. But at age 12, he wrote a detailed family history,
divided into three generations.
   ``My mother's family were wealthy Chinese merchants who went to
the Philippines in the 19th century,'' Hwang says. ``My father's
family came from Shanghai where my paternal grandfather was a
businessman.''
   Hwang's parents arrived in the United States to go to school _
his father to study business at the University of Southern
California, his mother to study piano. They met at a foreign
students' dance at USC.
   Hwang was born in Los Angeles and grew up in a comfortable
California suburb. He has two younger sisters, one a cellist and
the other an elementary school teacher.
   Hwang's father wanted him to study business in college. But he
ended up at Stanford which didn't have an undergraduate business
program, so he majored in English literature.
   ``I started writing plays in college,'' Hwang says.``I liked the
idea of creating a world which then would exist in front of you.''
   In 1978, he studied writing with Sam Shepard and Maria Irene
Fornes at the fledgling Padua Hills Playwrights Festival in
Claremont, Calif.
   ``It was a real mind opener for me,'' Hwang says. ``They helped
me get in touch with my subconscious, in terms of using the
subconscious to influence your work and give your characters life.''
   Out of the festival came ``FOB,'' the story of a young Chinese
man _ ``fresh off the boat'' _ coming to United States to live with
his Chinese-American relatives. The play was first performed at his
Stanford dormitory, and during his senior year it was accepted by
the National Playwrights Conference in Connecticut. From there in
the summer of 1979, ``FOB'' was picked up by the New York
Shakespeare Festival for production in New York in 1980.
   ``After that, I kind of had a career,'' Hwang says. ``I've
always been able to make a living as a writer. It's been a
combination of the play writing, some film and television writing
and grants.''
   Now he's cautiously enjoying his fame as a Tony Award-winning
playwright.
   ``I had a vaccination against this at a younger age,'' Hwang
says. ``When I was in my early 20s, I had a certain amount of work
done. Not at this level, but I got a certain amount of attention
and dealt with these things at a smaller level. I like to think
that I'm more prepared.''
   Since the opening of ``M. Butterfly,'' Hwang has turned his
attention to a new music-theater monologue he is creating with
Glass and designer Jerome Sirlin. It's called ``1,000 Airplanes on
the Roof'' and concerns the unlikely subject of UFO abductions. The
piece, starring actor Rocco Sisto, premieres in Vienna this month
and comes to the United States in September.
   Hwang, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Ophelia, would
like to get back to writing his next play. One already has been
commissioned by the South Coast Repertory of Costa Mesa, Calif.,
which received a Tony this year as outstanding regional theater.
   ``When I'm working on a play, the play determines the hours,''
he says. ``I can write continuously. Consequently, I can finish my
plays fairly quickly, usually between three and six weeks.''
   Hwang feels he gradually has been able to get attention as a
playwright, not a Chinese-American playwright.
   ``I feel less like a spokesman for Asian-American playwrights
than I did the last time around,'' says Hwang, referring to the
days when ``FOB'' and ``The Dance and the Railroad'' first
attracted attention. ``Those early plays were specifically
Chinese-American.
   ``Today, I am less inclined to accept the role of spokesman for
the Asian-American community. Once, I felt duty-bound to fulfill
it. Now I feel it's not really possible for me to be any kind of
spokesman for any view other than my own.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ You can put kids in the classrooms, but you
can't make them learn. You have to make them want to learn. And
that, says teachers union leader Albert Shanker, will require major
innovations in the nation's school systems.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ It's the old dog food story that Albert Shanker
draws on once again to deliver his indictment of American schools
to students at the Harvard Graduate School of Education:
   Despite the best ingredients, pretty packaging and an aggressive
ad campaign, Brand X dog food just isn't selling. ``The dogs just
don't like it,'' a nervous corporate underling tells his boss.
   And that is what is wrong with American education, Shanker tells
these future school administrators and Ph.D.s.
   ``The lesson is right, the books are right ... but in the end,
if the dogs don't eat it, it doesn't make any difference what's
good about the dog food,'' says the president of the American
Federation of Teachers.
   Shanker, who went to jail twice in New York in the 1960s for
leading his teachers on illegal strikes, today is one of the
severest critics of public schools and the leading advocate for
radical changes in the way they are run.
   In his lectures at Harvard, in interviews and in the speeches he
makes while traveling a half-million miles each year, Shanker
argues that American schools are failing 80 percent of the students
who pass through their doors.
   ``What you have in schools today is very similar to what you had
in the field of medicine for a couple of thousand years,'' Shanker
says. ``People would go to doctors hoping to get cured, but they
actually got hurt. Doctors didn't realize that they were supposed
to sterilize their instruments or wash their hands.''
   His solution?
   Make school teaching more like medicine. Let teachers work in
teams under lead teachers, who would diagnose problems and
prescribe treatment for the classroom teachers to apply.
   They would also command salaries sharply higher than the $28,085
the AFT says the average American schoolteacher made last year. But
fewer would make it to the top.
   ``I know that sounds bad,'' Shanker tells his Harvard pupils,
``but remember as you get fewer teachers, if you do it right,
they're all of higher quality.''
   Shanker takes no comfort from polls that show parents giving
local public schools good marks and rating their own child's school
even better.
   ``In a way the satisfaction of parents is due to pretty
effective public relations,'' says Shanker, citing a recent study
that found nearly every state claiming its children are above
average on tests _ a statistical impossibility.
   ``But what does average mean?'' asks Shanker, who says a more
reliable measure is the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, which has found that most 17-year-olds cannot handle
junior high school math concepts, read complex materials or
decipher a bus schedule.
   ``How many people in this country know that only 15 percent of
the 17{-year-olds can write a halfway decent letter _ with a lot of
misspellings and grammatical errors?'' he asks Harvard students.
``Maybe we've got to generate a lot of unhappiness.
   ``There is compelling evidence that the current structure of
schools actually harms large numbers of students and prevents large
numbers of students from learning.
   ``We need to rethink everything that now goes on: Rethink the
passive nature of kids; rethink asking kids questions in front of
other kids; rethink when we let kids into school; rethink whether
you move them around every 40 or 45 minutes.''
   Shanker proposes letting any group of six to 12 teachers form an
autonomous school within a school, with a pro-rated share of the
budget, to experiment with different ways of teaching. It would
have the blessings of the principal, school board and local union,
and participation by teachers and students would be voluntary.
   Once given a green light, each experimental school would be
given free rein for five to 10 years to demonstrate whether it had,
indeed, come up with better formulas for learning.
   ``What we need are experiments,'' Shanker says. ``See if you can
model a school on a law firm. See if you can model it on group
medical practice. See if you can model it on the university. See if
you can look at what Hewlett-Packard does and Procter & Gamble.''
   Shanker envisions schools where the lecturing would be done by
videotape, and where students could work in teams, progressing at
their own pace and learning in their own style.
   Although there might be fewer certified teachers, there would be
more adults in the classroom through wider use of aides, interns
and volunteers.
   Shanker says it isn't practical to hope that all teachers'
salaries could be raised to the point where education would attract
people of the caliber of law, medicine and the other professions.
   It would cost nearly $30 billion to raise every teacher's salary
by $10,000, and that ``is not likely to happen,'' says Shanker.
   ``Even if it did happen,'' he says, ``we would still have a very
tough time getting additional teachers of much greater quality
because IBM isn't going to go out of business. They'll just raise
salaries a little bit more.''
   Shanker says his AFT locals will keep pressing at the bargaining
table for better salaries, smaller classes and better working
conditions. But real improvements in the teachers' lot will never
materialize ``as long as schools are run the way they are now.''

   Shanker was jailed twice in New York City in the 1960s for
leading teachers to illegal strikes. His image was such that Woody
Allen lampooned him in the movie ``Sleeper'' as the guy who
precipitated nuclear war.
   That image gave way as Shanker began rubbing elbows with
governors and corporate chieftains; got a seat on the Trilateral
Commission, a high-powered foreign policy group; and launched a
weekly ``Where We Stand'' column that appears as a paid
advertisement in the Sunday New York Times. He is also a vice
president of the AFL-CIO.
   Shanker, president of the 665,000-member AFT since 1974, has
long championed tough school standards and was an early advocate of
rigorous tests for incoming teachers. He had a pivotal role in the
creation of a voluntary National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards.
   His adversaries scoff at the image of the new Shanker, and even
some of his allies think he has too little faith in the efficacy of
traditional instruction.
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, a persistent critic
of mediocre school performance, says Shanker has failed ``to
recognize the power of a great teacher.''
   Myron Lieberman, an education professor who championed
collective bargaining for teachers in the 1950s and is now an
unsparing critic of unions, calls Shanker ``the most skillful
manipulator in the field of education.''
   Lieberman, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, says,
``The image of him as some kind of courageous statesman doesn't
square with my experience and my perception. What Al says is not
binding on any local organization. ... The AFT contract in Chicago
is a complete disaster from any public or parent point of view.''
   Bennett has called Chicago's schools the nation's worst and laid
much of the blame at the door of the Chicago Teachers Union, Local
1 of the AFT, which has struck nine times in the past 19 years.
   ``They have bludgeoned that school system. The union has taken
what it could get and has not served the teachers,'' says Bennett.
   Bennett says the AFT has been ``a bit more innovative, not so
hidebound'' as the National Education Association in places such as
Rochester, N.Y., Dade County, Fla., and Hammond, Ind., where
Shanker's locals have accepted stricter accountability in exchange
for more say in running schools.
   But Bennett says the experience in Chicago shows the AFT ``can
be as intransigent and mindless as the NEA.''
   Shanker says of the situation in Chicago, ``They're in the
middle of a war.''
   ``I don't feel any need to call Jackie Vaughan and say, `Make
nice and talk differently,' because she doesn't have anybody to
deal with on the other side,'' says Shanker, referring to the CTU's
president. ``I think if there were some opening to really be able
to do something there, she would be very cooperative.''
   Bill Honig, California's superintendent of public instruction
and an ally of Shanker's on curricular reform, says, ``While I
agree with Al we're nowhere near where we have to be, I think
school is getting a lot better for a large number of kids, not just
20 percent.''
   When storm clouds gathered over American schools in 1983 with
the release of the explosive ``A Nation At Risk'' report, Shanker
quickly signaled that his union was willing to consider any and all
reforms.
   He was rewarded with invitations to the White House, and
President Reagan addressed the AFT convention that summer, using
the occasion to blast the NEA for opposing merit pay and for
sponsoring a dovish course guide to nuclear arms.
   But Shanker was never enamored of Reagan's education policies,
and his relations with Bennett have turned frosty of late.
   After attending a White House ceremony last April marking the
fifth anniversary of ``A Nation At Risk,'' Shanker sent an open
letter to Bennett accusing him of a ``major failure of leadership.''
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the 1.9 million-member NEA,
remarks, ``It took him 3{ years to realize Mr. Bennett was not an
advocate for education.''
   She charges that Shanker grabbed headlines with controversial
stands on merit pay and by favoring choice in public education and
then backed away from them.
   Shanker says part of the problem with American schools is that
too many parents and teachers are comfortable with the status quo.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They arrived in the 1930s to help modernize
farming, particularly cotton farming. They stayed and flourished
when they found it easier to be black in the Soviet Union than in
their native American South.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>TASHKENT, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At night, when they were finished
working, they sang the blues, and their voices carried over the
sun-parched cotton fields of Soviet Central Asia.
   Their homes _ Mississippi, Virginia, Harlem _ were half a world
away.
   They had come to the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s to
build a better world, to earn a living during the Depression, and
to flee the bigotry they had known at home because their skin was
black.
   In the '20s and '30s, Americans by the tens of thousands flocked
to the Soviet Union to work. Driven by revolutionary fervor or
joblessness at home, they felled trees in Karelia, built blast
furnaces in Magnitogorsk and founded an industrial colony at
Kuzbass in Siberia.
   But none of their stories is more poignant than that of the
group of American blacks, led by Communist Party member Oliver
Golden, who arrived in Tashkent on the mournful steppes of
Uzbekistan in 1932 after a five-day train trip from Moscow.
   ``He had seen the terrible conditions of the country and its
ruined economy,'' says Golden's daughter Lily, 53, a historian who
now lives in Moscow. ``His idea was that not just white Americans,
but blacks as well, must help the Soviet Union.''
   Golden and his colleagues, all agricultural experts, had signed
a two-year contract with the Soviet-American trade organization,
Amtorg, to help modernize cotton growing and farming in one of the
country's most backward regions.
   For their talents, they would earn about $100 a month.
   ``The members of the group did not belong to any political
party. The group was made up of young black specialists with
different ideas about life,'' George W. Tynes recalled in the
memoirs he wrote before his death in 1982.
   For Tynes, the youngest of 10 children of a Roanoke, Va.,
preacher, the opportunity was a dream come true.
   ``The idea of going to a country where no racism existed and
where I would be given an equal chance to work according to my
ability was just what I had dreamed about all of my life,''
recalled Tynes, a 1931 agriculture graduate of Wilberforce
University in Ohio, where he was a Black All-America halfback.
   He eventually chose to spend the rest of his life in the Soviet
Union.
   Golden, too, decided to make the Soviet Union his home. He is
still remembered in Uzbekistan as a ``black-skinned giant.''
   Golden, son of a former slave from Clarksdale, Miss., began work
on a cotton farm at age 10 and served with the U.S. Army in France
during World War I. But after studying agriculture at Tuskegee
Institute in Alabama and Alcorn State in Mississippi, Golden
couldn't find work in that field. He became a dining car waiter,
instead, and was outraged at how black workers were treated. He
joined the American Communist Party in 1925.
   Golden went to Moscow for a brief period to learn the trade of
party militant. In 1931, he contacted black agricultural
specialists, asking them to return with him to the Soviet Union.
   The 16-member party arrived by ship in Leningrad on a frigid day
in November 1931, after an Atlantic crossing aboard a German liner.
For Tynes, who had been teaching in Maryland with a certificate
that restricted him to ``colored schools,'' the egalitarianism of
Soviet Russia was a striking contrast to his native South and its
segregation laws.
   Here, Tynes recalled, ``there was no `for black' or `for white'
signs; here was a people working together, black and white, to
build a better life for everyone with no bar because of color.''

   At Tashkent, the group split up. Tynes was sent to a railroad
whistle stop south of the city named Yangiyul, where he helped
Soviets build their own farm machinery by studying foreign-made
farm implements. He also tried his hand at poultry breeding.
   Golden and his wife, Bertha Byalek, a Polish-born New Yorker who
was the only white in the group, went to the Central Cotton
Selection Station to try to produce a new hybrid suited to
Uzbekistan's broiling summers.
   The group members worked ``from dawn to dusk,'' the newspaper
Tashkent Pravda wrote decades later. ``Under mulberry trees by the
canals at night, they sang the Negro blues.''
   Their research work was instrumental in blending features from
native, American and Egyptian cotton plants to obtain a boll that
opened at the right time before harvest, Uzbekistan historian
Valery Germanov said in a interview.
   Black poet Langston Hughes, who visited Tashkent in 1933, wrote
of spending Christmas that year ``inside Golden's neat,
white-painted cottage.''
   ``We even had a pumpkin pie for dessert, and the tables were
loaded down with all the American-style dishes that those clever
Negro wives could concoct away over there in Uzbekistan,'' Hughes
recalled. ``They were delightful hosts, these cotton-collective
Negroes from America in the middle of a mud-cake oasis frosted with
snow.''
   At the end of their contract, most group members went back to
America. Others stayed, including Tynes, Golden and Joseph Sutton,
a microbiologist and a former professor under George Washington
Carver at Tuskegee Institute.
   For Golden, the birth of his daughter Lily in July 1934
convinced him not to return to his native America.
   ``He couldn't imagine having a white wife and a black daughter
in the U.S. at that time,'' Lily Golden says, speaking in heavily
Russian-accented English. ``He remembered how hard it was for him
and my mother _ a black man and a white woman _ when they lived in
Harlem.''
   Golden went to work as a researcher at Tashkent's Irrigation
Institute. The man from Mississippi, who became a Soviet citizen in
1935, was so popular that he was elected to the city council.
   In 1940, Golden died at age 48. He had a heart ailment and
kidney injuries reportedly inflicted when policemen beat him during
a Communist Party demonstration in New York in the 1920s.
   He was buried under a lilac bush at a cemetery on a dusty road
on the fringes of Tashkent. The granite slab that marks his grave
was rediscovered last year by a Tashkent schoolteacher interested
in the role of American blacks in Uzbekistan's past.
   Golden's wife, who also had become a Soviet citizen, died in
Moscow at age 80.
   Lily Golden became the tennis champion of Soviet Central Asia
before moving to Moscow where she studied African history and
music. She became a researcher and historian in both fields, and
made her first trip to the United States last year.
   She said only one member of her father's group is still alive _
a man she knows only as Rowan who lives in Washington D.C.
   George Tynes, who also became a Soviet citizen, became a
recognized expert in raising chickens, ducks and turkeys. He
married a Soviet woman, Maria, in 1937. Their three children are
Soviet citizens.
   Slava Tynes, 48, a former journalist with the government news
agency Novosti, says he has no bonds with his father's American
past.
   ``I grew up and have lived all my life with Russians. In our
home, only Russian was spoken,'' the balding, bearded man said in
an interview.
   But he kept a copy of his father's memoirs.
   George Tynes wrote of the economic opportunities he had in the
Soviet Union, in contrast to the prejudice and bigotry he found in
the American South:
   ``I often wondered _ how could it be that I was born in the
U.S.A., worked and studied in the U.S.A., graduated from college in
the U.S.A., became an All-America football player in the U.S.A.,
and now just because of my color, I would be denied equal rights in
the U.S.A., the country where my father and mother were born, lived
and worked all of their lives.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ She had Alzheimer's disease and, to her husband,
seemed to be suffering so much that he shot her to death at her
nursing home. It was a tragedy that some saw as a mercy killing,
others as murder. The case points up some of the ambiguities in the
concept of euthanasia. Last of three articles.

   Oscar Carlson loaded the old revolver
that he had used to shoot hogs and headed from his farm home to the
Crestview Manor Nursing Home. As he drove the two miles into town,
he recalled, ``I prayed the Lord to help me, that whatever was laid
upon me to do, I would be able to accomplish.''
   What was propelling Carlson to the nursing home this February
day was the news that his wife of 47 years, Agnes, her mind already
fogged by Alzheimer's disease, had broken her hip and would need
surgery to replace it. Feeling guilty for having put her in the
nursing home, he had taken her out often for rides in the country.
On the day before, Feb. 28, a Sunday, while they were at the farm
home, she had fallen on the porch.
   ``I could take no more, so I think my mind cracked,'' Carlson
says. The next thing he remembered, he was in Room 103 standing
beside his wife's bed.
   ``Do you want to go to the hospital?'' he asked her. ``No,'' she
said. Then using a term he said she understood because he had used
it in his job of butchering hogs, he asked her, ``Do you want me to
give you a shot so you don't have to ...? '' She looked at him as
he stood there with the gun in his hand. ``Yes,'' she replied,
according to his court testimony.
   Just then, Judy Berg, a nurse, walked into the room with a
gurney to take her to the hospital. ``He had the gun to her
chest,'' she said. ``As I looked at him, I said, `My God! He's
going to shoot her!' Oscar looked up at me at the same time and
pulled the trigger.''
   ``I fired twice in her chest and then I sat down and watched her
die so nice and peaceful,'' Carlson said. `` ... Afterward, when
she opened her mouth a little bit ...,'' he fired twice more. ``I
didn't want the doctors to get hold of her and start pumping out
blood and putting on respiration and all that stuff and tubes and I
could see no sense to that.''
   Those shots reverberated throughout this farming community of
571 people, where the Crop Feed Service Center and the railroad
tracks running through the center of town give it an identity of
Midwestern security and serenity, where no one could ever imagine
that Oscar Carlson, who, in all of his 78 years had never had so
much as a parking ticket, would do such a thing.
   Not the Oscar Carlson who had grown up in Douglas County, who
had to trudge through the snowdrifts for miles to get to school and
missed so many classes because of the weather that he finished only
eighth grade, who at age 16 began hiring out to farmers, milking
cows, cleaning barns and shucking grain.
   The killing unleashed a flood of emotions: anger and anxiety,
fear and frustration, guilt and grief.
   In a broader sense, Carlson's deed raised once more that tangled
question of anyone's right to end another's life in a mercy killing
_ especially under slightly ambiguous circumstances which, in some
people's minds, clouded the issue here.
   Not Oscar Carlson, nor anyone else, the town said. He pleaded
guilty to second-degree murder in a plea bargain and was sentenced
May 26 to 43 months in prison. With good behavior, he will be
eligible for parole in 28 months.
   At the nursing home, and in the town, Carlson brewed anger and
fear. Among his three daughters, he spawned guilt, grief and
frustration.

   ``We have residents still afraid he might come,'' Barbara
Walters, director of nursing at Crestview Manor, said in a recent
interview while Carlson was free on bail to go wherever he wanted
except to the nursing home and to friends' homes where he once had
been invited but was now unwelcome.
   ``I went through every stage of grieving, and I still feel very
angry,'' said Walters, looking out over the lounge area where
pitiful residents sat, one a 102-year-old woman, her head buried in
her hands. Two other residents in the room with Agnes when she was
shot also suffer from Alzheimer's. Other residents followed the
tragedy on the television set in the lounge and in the newspapers.
   ``The staff is still angry,'' says Mrs. Walters. ``I think we
feel kind of violated. How would you feel if someone came into your
home and shot somebody. It's a small facility, 70 beds. We pretty
much feel like all family.''
   Jennie Harjes, assistant director of nursing, remembered that
two days before Agnes was shot, she recognized a visitor and called
her by name. ``That's the way Alzheimer's is,'' she says.
   Both staff and residents of the nursing home have suffered
nightmares.
   ``I dream that I'm here at work and that I'm trying to do my job
and I see Oscar,'' says Harjes. ``He's interfering with my being
able to do my job. It has interfered in all our lives, made it
uneasy for all of us. He's just there, his presence is there.''
   ``When it first happened,'' says Judy Berg, ``I'd wake up in the
middle of the night. When I tried to go back to sleep, I'd see it
... To me, it wasn't a mercy killing. The woman was in no pain
except she'd broken her hip. She wasn't the one suffering. It was
Oscar watching her state of Alzheimer's.''
   Says Bonnie Champeau, director of Crestview Manor: ``A murder
was committed here. Mercy killing or euthanasia is basically done
to relieve pain. It's usually not done to relieve the mental pain
of family members. It's usually not done with four shots from a gun
for other people to witness and live with.''
   Many of the elderly people, particularly women, feared Carlson
while he was free awaiting sentencing. Friends who know him well
welcomed him even though they were angry with him at first. His
family felt he needed daily supervision. Eight nursing homes turned
him away because they feared he would upset other residents. His
attorney, Thomas J. Reif, finally found one willing to accept him
in the interim.
   The issue, says Ann L. Carrott, the Douglas County prosecutor,
is whether Carlson had the right to decide whether his wife
couldn't take it anymore. She says she had to treat the shooting as
a murder and that she is opposed to lessening the degree of guilt
in mercy killings.
   ``Where do you draw the line?'' she asks. ``What type of illness
would warrant that kind of a defense? Is it going to be based on
illness or age or disability? I don't know that society wants to
start drawing those kinds of lines.''

   Agnes Carlson was 72 years old. Her mental condition had
worsened to the point where her mind often was fixed in the '40s
when Oscar came home from World War II. She thought he was her
father and began calling him grandpa. Agnes' family name also was
Carlson, and her father's first name was Alven.
   ``She would make up an extra bed in the evening, like on the
sofa. Either she should sleep there or I should sleep there,'' says
Carlson. ``That often happened. If she would lie down there, I
said, `You better come to me,' and we would lie down and say our
prayers, and then I'd say, `You can go back if you want to,' but
she never did.''
   She hid his mail. ``Those letters that had money and the checks
like Social Security, they were to Oscar Carlson and I was supposed
to be Alven Carlson so I wasn't supposed to have anything to do
with them.''
   She longed to visit apple orchards that had vanished with her
memory. Says Carlson: ``A lot of times in the evenings she would
say, `Why don't we take a drive down to my folks' place.' And I
would tell her that there's no place there anymore. The house was
burned down and they plowed down the apple orchard. So there was
nothing to go for, but I would usually take her down there.''
   She sometimes didn't bathe for weeks. ``She was kind of shy so
she done the best she could on that herself.''
   Sometimes Oscar helped her wash her hair. ``I always set her
hair every week.''
   This wasn't the Agnes that Oscar and their three daughters
remembered. Oscar met Agnes in April 1940 when Agnes'
brother-in-law, a customer of a butcher shop in Miltona where Oscar
worked, asked him to give her a ride to Evansville one Sunday.
Oscar told his brother, ``That's one girl I got to take out again.''
   He made a date with her for the following Wednesday night. Six
months later they were married on the farm where he was born. He
and Agnes ran a meat market until 1942 when he went into the Army.
After his discharge in 1945, they started farming 80 acres they had
bought before he went into the service.
   When his three daughters finally persuaded him she should be
placed in a nursing home in June 1987, things got worse for him
instead of better. Filled with guilt and depression, he no longer
felt like pulling the weeds in the garden, as he put it.
   Reif, his attorney, says he intentionally avoided referring to
the shooting as a mercy killing.
   ``We do not think what Oscar did was premeditated, thought out
or planned in the type of detail that a mercy killer would normally
do,'' he says.
   But according to Bruce Montplaisir, Carlson's son-in-law, Oscar
had told people Agnes would be better off dead.
   ``The morning when we put her in the nursing home,'' Montplaisir
recalled, ``he'd said, `I'm a hundred percent for that. You know,
I'm the kind of guy that could shoot his own dog.' I think he felt
that he was almost to the point that his only relief would be to
get her into the nursing home before something like that would
happen.''
   Shortly before Agnes was shot, nursing home officials expressed
concern to one of his daughters, Mary Beth Montplaisir, telling her
that Carlson had said, ``Maybe if you don't feed her so much she
wouldn't live so long.''
   Mary Beth says that about two weeks before the shooting, she had
talked to nursing home officials about removing two guns from her
father's home. But before the three daughters could meet with a
social worker to discuss it, their mother was dead.
   ``I feel kind of an anger at the whole system,'' says the
daughter, a grade school remedial reading and math teacher. ``I
feel more frustration because I wanted to keep something like this
from happening, and I was not able to do it ... I guess I don't
really feel so angry at my father as I feel sorry for him. I just
don't think it should have happened.''
   They buried Agnes on March 3. Millie Penuel, the youngest
daughter, has said:
   ``It was probably a couple of years ago that I really
acknowledged that my mother was not my mother anymore. It felt like
she had died and we were left with this little lady who looked like
her ... So, yes, it had felt like we maybe lost her earlier, but we
were not able to have a funeral then.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It started more than 300 years ago with two
modest progenitors, one French, one English. This first pair of
scientific journals has spawned a multitude of some 40,000 to
60,000 that floods scholars and scientists today. Much of this
outpouring goes unread, but it gets people published.

   Pity the heart specialist who wants to keep up.
   He could read Cardiology, the American Journal of Cardiology and
the American College of Cardiology Journal. The American Heart
Journal and the British Heart Journal. Arteriosclerosis and
Atherosclerosis.
   And more. Much more.
   Cardiologists are not alone in this. Physicists, entomologists,
anthropologists, sociologists and everyone else who makes a living
in science and medicine are deluged with magazines full of
information they need to know but don't have time to read.
   ``Too many people are publishing too many papers in too much of
a hurry,'' contends Dr. Thomas P. Stossel, former editor of the
Journal of Clinical Investigation.
   Not everyone agrees that the huge volume of ``the literature,''
as it's called, is necessarily a bad thing. But fretting about it
is probably as old as the ritual of publishing scientific reports
in periodicals.
   ``This complaint: `Can't keep up. Can't keep up.' People have
been saying that forever,'' says Dr. Henry Small, director of
corporate research at the Institute for Scientific Information.
``This is the normal griping of anybody who's literate. Who can
read all the new novels? Who can read all the newspapers?''
   It all began in 1665. In January of that year, Le Journal des
Savants came out in Paris, followed in March by the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society in London.
   The goal was to give learned men a convenient way to keep up
with the scholarly observations of their fellows. The idea caught
on. At the start of the 18th century, there were about 100
journals. By the beginning of the 20th, there were 10,000.
   Not only can nobody read all the journals, nobody can say with
certainty how many there are.
   Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory lists about 31,000
scientific, medical and technical publications but doesn't claim to
know about all of them. Dr. Belver Griffith, professor of
information studies at Drexel University, guesses the worldwide
total is somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 and is growing at a
rate of 4 percent or 5 percent a year.
   A browse through any science library shows just how diverse this
enterprise is.
   A few journals have broad tastes. Nature and Science, as their
names suggest, will publish articles about almost anything in
science. But most are satisfied with narrower horizons. There is,
for instance, Experimental and Applied Acarology (about ticks and
mites), the Journal of Applied Ichthyology (fish) and the Clubroot
News Letter (plant disease).
   Some journals get to the point quickly in their titles. Yeast,
Blood, Gut, Trees and Starch leave little doubt about their
specialties. The International Journal of Aerial and Space Imaging,
Remote Sensing and Integrated Geographical Systems and the
International Multi-disciplinary Journal Devoted to Swallowing and
its Disorders are a bit less terse.
   Some are downright obscure. Try to guess what K-Theory is about
(mathematics). Or Stochastic Hydrology and Hydraulics (random
models in water resources). Or the Journal of Paleolimnology
(prehistoric waters). Or Genomics (gene mapping).
   Many journals seem to overlap. In the area of drugs that affect
the brain, there is Psycholopharmacology, the Journal of
Psychopharmacology and the Journal of the British Association of
Psychopharmacology, not to mention Neuropsychopharmacology.
   They also spawn quickly. The young field of teaching computers
to think has Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design,
Artificial Intelligence Review and AI & Society, among others.
   Reading these magazines is often heavy going, even for people
who are conversant with, say, the nuances of applied acarology.
Most sag with dry, formal write-ups of scientific experiments and
observations. Even the most prestigious are booby-trapped with
jargon that reduces simple ideas to properly academic tangles of
verbiage.
   So does anyone read this stuff?
   ``The actual readership of fundamental scholarly journals
appears to be quite low,'' says Griffith. ``The best-read articles
in a standard, disciplinary based journal will be read, at most, by
2 percent of the people who receive it. We found that there were
almost no readers.''

   Professional journals, such as those that go to doctors and
engineers, may be more widely read. But how many journals about
cardiovascular diseases _ Ulrich's lists about 135 of them _ should
a heart specialist be expected to plow through?
   Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, estimates that five or six, properly chosen, is all the
average specialist needs to keep up with.
   However, Stossel says there are probably plenty of doctors who
read nothing but the throwaways, a disparaging term for the stacks
of relatively readable newspapers and magazines, filled with drug
ads, that arrive free in the mail each day.
   With all of this information, much of it trifling, it's no
surprise that some magazines do nothing but tell people what's in
other magazines. Newsletters are devoted to terse condensations of
the high points of the literature. Among these is the eight-page
Journal Watch, published every other week by the Massachusetts
Medical Society.
   ``We try to point out what doctors should know about and let
them know where they can find the article if they need it,'' says
Joe Elia, its executive editor. ``Nobody can read everything, and I
think some people throw up their hands and say, `There is so much.
I can't read any of it.'''
   Yet with all this volume, the printing presses churn out
hundreds of new titles each year, and established journals grow
fatter.
   The abstracting service of the American Chemical Society
produces brief summaries of all the chemistry articles and patents
it can find around the world. In 1957, it published 100,000. In
1966, it passed 200,000. In 1971, it exceeded 300,000. And in 1977,
it went beyond 400,000. The rate of growth has slowed since then,
but in 1987 it put out 476,178 abstracts from 13,000 journals.
   And that's just chemistry. Other areas are booming, too. For
instance, the 40 journals of the American Institute of Physics
published 23,042 articles in 1980. Last year, they published 33,955.
   Computers haven't done much to help cope with the avalanche of
information. They have made the journals more accessible.
Researchers can use them to scan big collections of titles and
abstracts for interesting subjects.
   However, once they zero in on the article they want to see, they
still must go to the printed journal, since the full texts of
reports are seldom kept in computers.
   The big-name journals are exclusive clubs. They publish a
quarter or less of all the papers submitted to them. Most of the
rejects eventually land in print in less choosy publications.
   Writes Drummond Rennie, senior contributing editor of the
Journal of the American Medical Association: ``There seems to be no
study too fragmented, no hypothesis too trivial, no literature
citation too biased or egotistical, no design too warped, no
methodology too bungled, no presentation of results too inaccurate,
too obscure and too contradictory, no analysis too self-serving, no
argument too circular, no conclusion too trifling or too
unjustified and no grammar and syntax too offensive for a paper to
end up in print.''
   Scientists buy journals, of course, especially the biggest and
best, which also tend to be the cheapest. But at fees often ranging
from $100 to $1,000 a year, many of the smaller magazines depend on
their main customers, the libraries. Some have huge collections _
the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md., subscribes to
about 12,000 _ and librarians frequently buy them without worrying
much about how often they are actually read.
   ``In a research library, you try to be as complete as you can,
given your resources, in anticipation that the good material you
get, even if it is not important now, may in time be of value,''
says Alan Erickson, head librarian at Harvard's Cabot Library.
``You can't be pragmatic and purchase exclusively for today's
audience, because you know there are going to be some people who
have to have access to the older literature.''
   So if the quality is bad and hardly anybody reads them, why do
all these articles get written and published? Griffith says the
journals serve as a sort of archives and registry.
   ``What these articles consist of is claims that a person has
done a certain type of work or made a certain achievement,'' he
says. ``He's registering that against the background of general
scholarship within a profession.''

   There seems to be no end to the proliferation of
scientific journals, and most of them are widely unread. Then what
accounts for the steadily increasing volume? In part, it's the need
to be published.
   Experiments rarely turn up products to be manufactured or ideas
to be patented. A few pages printed in a journal are all that most
researchers ever have to show for months in labs and libraries.
   Getting published is essential for people in science. It is how
they keep score. Impressive lists of published articles weigh
heavily in decisions about who will be hired and promoted by
universities and industry, and they are a factor when government
agencies decide where to give money for research.
   Some people argue that an emphasis on quantity, not quality,
encourages unhealthy and deceptive practices. Although faking
results is probably rare, they contend that other abuses are more
common, such as recycling the same data to different journals,
cutting the findings of an experiment into small chunks and
publishing them piecemeal, and adding the names of co-authors who
had nothing to do with the research.
   ``As the results get smaller and smaller, the discussion and
ballyhoo get more and more grandiose, because editors and other
people have to be convinced that this is an important study,'' says
Dr. Marcia Angell, senior deputy editor of the New England Journal
of Medicine.
   This system has advantages, too, she concedes. Little of
importance gets hidden because people constantly tell the world of
their latest discoveries, no matter how trivial. But in the end,
she believes the harm outweighs the benefits.
   ``The source of it is the system of rewards within the academic
community,'' Angell says. ``The journals are parasites. They are
taking advantage of that. The engine is driven by the system of
rewarding people for large numbers of publications.''
   Some institutions have begun to cut back on the number of
journal articles they will look at when hiring and promoting
faculty members. New guidelines at Harvard Medical School suggest
specific limits, such as five papers for an assistant professor,
seven for an associate professor and 10 for a full professor.
   David Pendlebury, an editor at The Scientist, a newspaper for
the profession, agrees that the system has its weaknesses. But he
believes the volume of published studies simply reflects the huge
success of science.
   ``While there might be an increase in the number of papers, it's
hard to believe that a cartel of scientists hungry for references
in their bibliographies get together and create a journal,'' he
says. ``A journal has to exist in response to an invisible college
of researchers. It's got to make some sort of intellectual or
economic sense to survive.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Freshwater mussels and clams are falling victim
to disease and greed, and experts ponder the fate of the rivers
that depend on them.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ecologist Richard Sparks has worked the
muddy bottoms of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers studying
freshwater clams and mussels _ nature's water filters _ and he
doesn't like what he sees.
   The shelled creatures are disappearing from their native North
American riverbeds, where they spend their lives filtering polluted
water through hairline openings in their shells. Scientists cite
two reasons.
   One is massive die-offs, as yet unexplained.
   The other is the voracious appetite of the Japanese cultured
pearl industry, which grinds tiny beads from mussel shells and
imbeds them in oysters to produce pearls. Over-zealous shellers are
staging a rush on U.S. mussel beds, further harming supplies.
   ``There used to be 50 species of mussels on the upper
Mississippi, and now there're only 36 to 38 left,'' says Sparks, a
river ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey at its
river research lab in Havana.
   Sparks is one of dozens of scientists and others in states
across the Midwest concerned about the plight of mussels and clams,
which come in all sizes and shapes and live as long as 50 years.
   ``I've been buying shells on the Mississippi River for 14
years,'' says D.E. ``Butch'' Ballenger, owner of the Mississippi
Valley Shell Co., in Muscatine, Iowa. ``I plan on doing this a long
time. That's why me and another buyer pushed for laws in Wisconsin
and Iowa to limit the season and shell size.''
   Ballenger, 49, employs about 130 harvesters. He exports his
shells to Japan and is working with environmentalists to get state
action to protect the mussels from over-harvest.
   He worries about the recent influx of shellers from rivers in
states such as Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   ``We're getting more and more shellers from out-of-state,''
Ballenger says. ``The mussel beds down south are exhausted, and
they're moving up here. States along the upper Mississippi
shouldn't sell out-of-state shelling licenses.''
   Shelling is a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States,
with shells alone selling for $300 to $1,000 per ton.
   In 1987, 1,128 tons were collected from Illinois and 1,016 tons
from Iowa. Wisconsin waters yielded 667 tons of shells in 1986, the
only full year for which figures were available.
   Freshwater clams and mussels are harvested by hand, using hooks
on poles or by dredging riverbeds.
   In Camden, Tenn., John Latendresse has branched out from simply
selling shells to Japan through his Tennessee Shell Co. Now, he's
growing pearls and producing jewelry _ the first American to crack
the Japanese-dominated industry.
   He says the cultured pearl industry accounts for 3,000 jobs in
Japan, and his dream is to bring as many of those as possible to
the United States. But the industry may be short-lived, Latendresse
says, unless state and federal lawmakers act to protect American
mussel beds.
   ``We exported $16 million worth of mussels to Japan in 1986,''
says Latendresse, citing industry research. ``Cultured pearls are a
$500 million a year industry over there. We're exhausting our
mussel beds to supply their industry. It's a big problem, and I'm
very concerned about it.''
   Even representatives of Japan's cultured pearl industry are
concerned about overharvest in the United States.
   ``It's a free-for-all out there,'' says Nori Sakata, president
of the Sakata Pearl Co. of Tokyo, referring to the competition
between shellers on American rivers. ``It's not just the
Mississippi River. It's the Ohio River and others. They definitely
need restrictions.
   ``The commercial harvesters are over-dredging the rivers. They
don't give the mussel beds a chance for any new growth to occur.
Everybody's trying to get in on it, and they're starting to dredge
smaller rivers. It doesn't do any good for the ecology.''
   Sakata runs the Chicago office of the company, which imports
jewelry and cultured pearls grown at the family oyster farm in
Japan. Founded in 1956, the company began its U.S. operation 25
years ago and had $3.5 million in sales last year.
   ``It think they might need to protect their resources better,''
Sakata says. ``The Persian Oriental Pearl industry is dead because
they didn't protect it. The Persian Gulf used to be a hotbed for
pearls.
   ``If people don't protect their resources, they're going to lose
them.''

   HAVANA: lose them.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ron Refsnider, a staff biologist for the federal Department of
the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service in Minneapolis, says
several states have laws governing mussel shells, although they are
inconsistent and vary widely.
   Refsnider says it's unlikely the agency will impose quotas or
restrict shelling, even though 25 species of mussels are on the
endangered list and 75 species are candidates.
   ``If anything regarding the threat to mussels is overstated,''
Refsnider says, ``it's the ease of solving the problem.
   ``Mussels are very good indicators of the biological health of
an ecosystem. A lot of factors have contributed to the very serious
mussel decline. It would cost millions of dollars to solve, and no
one is certain as to the cause.''
   Mussels don't help their cause any, Refsnider says, because they
are ``not a real charismatic species.'' They have largely been
ignored except for their commercial value.
   Mussels and their smaller cousins, clams, long have had
commercial value. American Indians collected them, ate the meat and
used the shells as ornaments. Prospectors set off ``pearl rushes''
on mussels in the 19th century, and in 1891 the pearl button
industry was launched using discarded shells.
   Development of plastics in the 1920s killed the pearl button
industry, and mussels had relative peace until water pollution
started taking its toll in the 1950s.
   The spread of mussels also was restricted by construction of
locks and dams as well as by declines in certain species of fish
that carry embryonic mussels like hitchhikers up and down river
systems.
   Recent studies about mussel die-offs in American rivers over the
past five years have focused on an invasion of disease-carrying
Asiatic clams. No matter the cause, their loss trickles down
through the ecosystem. Rivers become more polluted without nature's
filters, and wildlife that once fed on the little creatures are
driven from the area in their search for food.
   Proposals to save freshwater mussels and clams in the United
States have ranged from federal import taxes on pearls, mussel
harvest quotas, shorter shelling seasons and a ban on exporting raw
shells. But the solution most exciting to Sparks is creation of
river sanctuaries for endangered mussels.
   Seven sites along the Illinois side of the Mississippi River
have been proposed as sanctuaries, where scientists would have
unrestricted access to study mussels and clams.
   ``Sanctuaries are urgently needed on the Mississippi River,''
Sparks says. ``We have several endangered species which we must
save.''
   But Latendresse is not impressed with the sanctuary idea.
   ``Several states have created sanctuaries, but they don't follow
up with research funds to study the mussels so the sanctuaries are
worthless,'' he says. ``There's so much money to be made, the
shellers harvest them out of the sanctuaries.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ His life seems like something out of a Graham
Greene novel: A missionary priest with a talent for impressing his
superiors and other well-meaning people. To others, including
authorities in the United States and Italy, his dedication was to
Mammon. Throughout a singularly shady pilgrimage, the Rev. Lorenzo
Zorza never relinquished his role of wide-eyed innocence.

   The most tangible legacy of the Rev. Lorenzo
Zorza's two decades as a missionary is a small patch of concrete
near the Consolata Society mission in Somerset, N.J.
   On this site the Consolata fathers had weekly sales of used
clothes and furniture to benefit their African missions. Lorenzo's
task: To supervise the lay people who ran the rummage sale.
   But the priest had a bigger idea: To transform the site into
``Consolata Village,'' a tourist attraction with music, food,
rides, a gift shop and a copy of the Trevi Fountain. Zorza had the
concrete fountain base poured before telling the other priests of
his plans.
   ``We said, `Hold it, this isn't our kind of thing,''' recalls
the Rev. Reno Aiardi.
   That incident 15 years ago was the first of many attempts by
Zorza to mix piety and profit. His explanation at the time _ I was
only trying to help _ would become a refrain as he lurched from
scrape to scrape: In 1982, when he was arrested for art smuggling;
in 1987, when he was arrested for trying to sell stolen property,
and this spring, when he was accused of being a bag man for an
international drug ring.
   After Zorza's April 6 arrest in Italy on the drug charge,
published reports linked him to two of Italy's biggest postwar
financial and political scandals: The collapse of Milan's Banco
Ambrosiano and the right-wing ``P-2'' conspiracy to undermine
Italy's constitutional government.
   In a prison interview broadcast on the syndicated television
program, ``A Current Affair,'' Zorza maintained his innocence. He
said he was guilty of drug charges only by ``association or
interpretation.''
   But he admitted his ministry, such as it was, had failed.
   ``I had all kinds of dreams ... and everything ... vanished,''
he said in heavily accented English. ``The reason is, I could never
lean on anything that was organized. It's easy to drive a car on a
highway or to walk on a trail someone made, but when you have to
make your own trail, you don't know what's there.''
   Zorza's odyssey began March 24, 1941, in a village in northern
Italy near the Yugoslav border. The youngest of nine children, he
began studying for the priesthood at age 11; at 24, he was ordained.
   Zorza was assigned by the Consolatas to Somerset, where he
impressed other priests with his ambition and willingness to work.
   ``The son of a gun is amazing,'' says Aiardi. ``If someone had
car trouble in the middle of the night, he'd say, `I'll go get
him.' If you told him, `There's this family that needs a little
something,' he'd be the first one to jump in the truck and bring it
to them.'''
   But Zorza soon became restless, Aiardi says. In the mid-1970s he
moved out, saying he wanted to raise money for missionary friends
in Brazil.
   ``I was taking a different direction,'' Zorza later explained.
But a conversation secretly recorded in 1982 indicated it may have
been a crooked one.
   In a meeting with a journalist posing as a shady art dealer,
Zorza's partner described the priest's Brazilian initiative as an
opportunity for profit, not charity. ``You can make more money in
this than paintings,'' he promised.
   Over the years, Zorza's fund-raising operations changed names
and locations, but ``it was never clear to us what he was doing,''
recalls Aiardi. ``Even when I'd ask him personally, `Larry, what
the heck are you doing?', he'd pass over it.''
   Zorza, who had become an American citizen, became a volunteer at
the Vatican's mission to the United Nations in 1978. His role soon
expanded, although he was neither a diplomat nor a paid employee.
By 1982 he was the fourth-ranking staffer.
   As usual, Zorza was always available: Driving nuns to the store,
representing the mission at Italian-American community functions,
picking up officials at the airport.
   He made contacts, including Francesco Pazienza, an Italian
financier later charged in the Ambrosiano collapse and convicted in
the 1980 bombing of a Bologna train station which killed 85 people.
   Europeo, an Italian magazine, says that Zorza, Pazienza and a
third man offered $4.5 million for an island in the Caribbean
nation of Antigua in order to create their own state, with stamps,
currency and liberal tax laws. But the deal fell through when
Antigua refused to cede sovereignty over the island, the magazine
said.
   During this period Zorza lived in the rectory of St. Agnes
Church on East 43rd Street, one of the most prominent parishes in
the New York archdiocese. Although not officially on the staff, he
said Mass, heard confessions and performed marriages. He boasted
that one of his most beloved parishioners was Greta Garbo.
   But one of Zorza's new friends led him into a trap.
   Peter Watson, the journalist posing as an art dealer, was told
Zorza was a diplomat with contacts at airports in New York and Rome
who would be willing to smuggle contraband art.
   When they met, Watson _ who was working with the Customs Service
_ asked Zorza if he had brought in much before. The priest nodded.
   ``Small things are better,'' he told Watson. ``Jewelry is good;
you have jewelry?''
   When Watson asked, ``You have brought in jewelry?'' Zorza
answered, ``Yes.''
   After the meeting, Watson was told Zorza would carry two
paintings to New York from Rome for $8,000. A week later Zorza
arrived at Kennedy Airport. With Customs agents secretly watching,
he declared only a bottle of wine, some books and family heirlooms.
   When he was arrested the next day, Zorza fainted. En route to
his arraignment, he told a Customs agent, ``I have to say Mass at 5
o'clock.''
   Zorza pleaded guilty. But before sentencing, the priest's
supporters deluged the prosecutor with phone calls, the judge with
letters. A typical plea came from Thomas L. Cassidy, managing
director of First Boston Corp., who wrote:
   ``I know of no person who has a greater concern for his fellow
man, to the detriment of his own personal interest. I cannot
conceive of Father Zorza doing anything illegal or immoral.... ''

   Although several months earlier he had tried to sell Sotheby's a
piece of forged pottery _ Judge Robert Ward said Zorza ``may not be
as knowledgeable and sophisticated as others'' in the case.
Pronouncing it ``unlikely that such conduct would be repeated,'' he
sentenced Zorza to three years probation.
   Zorza said it all was a mistake. ``I did it sincerely to help
somebody, and now I am terribly sorry. ... I have learned a lot.''
   But outside the courtroom, Watson wrote in his book, ``The
Caravaggio Conspiracy,'' ``the weeping suddenly stopped and he
laughed and joked with his lawyer about the way they had beaten the
system.''
   Zorza was banished from the U.N. mission and St. Agnes. He
stopped visiting Somerset and refused his order's offers of a new
assignment, including one in Africa.
   Although his rights to say Mass and administer other sacraments
were not renewed by the archdiocese at the end of 1985, Zorza
continued to say Mass at various locations, including a Catholic
women's home on West 44th Street.
   Those who met Zorza noted his shabby dress _ stained, frayed
jackets, torn pants, scuffed shoes.
   He once came into a Theater District restaurant run by another
priest. He was trying to sell watches with a drawing of Christ on
the face. A cross formed the minute and hour hands.
   At roughly the same time, according to Italian newspaper
accounts, the ragged priest became interested in the Banco
Ambrosiano collapse. The papers, citing American police files that
were turned over to Italian judges, say Zorza hired a private
investigator to reconstruct the bank money's route to South America.
   When Roberto Calvi, the head of the bank, was found hanged from
a bridge in London in 1982, Zorza contacted his family to offer his
services, according to Calvi's son Carlo.
   Zorzo allegedly knew Caesar ``Tall Guy'' Bonventre, a
Sicilian-born member of New York's Bonanno crime family. After
pieces of Bonventre's body were found stuffed in a glue vat, Zorza
``was seriously worried about his own life,'' the investigator said.
   Meanwhile, Zorza apparently had time for more mundane matters.
In the summer of 1987 he and another man walked into a Manhattan
theater ticket agency and tried to sell $40,000 worth of tickets to
``Les Miserables.''
   Employees immediately recognized the tickets _ they had been
stolen from the same office six months earlier. They told the men
to come back later and called the police.
   After his arrest, Zorza said he was only helping friends who
``never told me the full story about the tickets.''
   ``I made two mistakes in my life, and I'm learning from this,''
he said. ``I don't want to, but I'm going to have to stop doing
favors for people.''
   That was August 21. On Aug. 9, Zorza had met two women at Newark
Airport who had flown in from Rome. Federal agents suspect they
were carrying heroin.
   Next morning the priest spoke with Michael Bernardo, a partner
in the latest of a series of Zorza's businesses, Fashion Brokerage
International Trading on Fifth Avenue, and a reputed member of the
Italian Mafia.
   ``There is a big close-out of suits in the area of Camden and
Philadelphia,'' Zorza said. ``Do you want to talk with them?''
   ``Yes, if it's nighttime,'' said Bernardo. Although federal
agents monitoring the conversation insist ``suits'' meant
``drugs,'' Zorza claims he was brokering a sale of discounted suits.
   When Zorza was arrested in Rome in April, it appeared he would
be extradited to the United States to face charges that could put
him in prison for the rest of his life.
   But his lawyer _ Frank Rubino, who also represents Gen. Manuel
Noriega _ says Zorza since has been questioned by Italian judges in
connection with Banco Ambrosiano, Calvi's death and Mafia art
swindles, and that it now is unclear whether Italy will relinquish
him.
   Zorza, meanwhile, claims to be at peace.
   ``Everything that happens is good, is grace, even if you have to
suffer,'' he said in the television interview. ``I've never been so
serene in my life.''

   Tom Wopat says after seven years on ``The
Dukes of Hazzard,'' with its good ol' boy stereotypes, working on
his newest series seems like ``the Promised Land.''
   Wopat stars in the CBS summer series ``Blue Skies,'' in which he
plays an advertising executive who gives up his career in San
Franciso and returns with his new family to his hometown in Oregon.
   ``I look at the `Dukes' as something that will fade in time,''
says Wopat. ``I don't mind the notoriety. I don't disclaim it. If I
keep plugging away at what I do, people will see a well-rounded
entertainer and see that I'm not a one-trick pony.''
   ``Blue Skies,'' half-way through an eight-week run, also stars
Season Hubley as his wife, Pat Hingle as his father and Kim Hauser,
Alyson Croft and Danny Gerard as their chidren.
   ```Dukes' was a great education for me,'' says Wopat, ``but when
I started working with Carol and Nigel McKeand it was like the
Promised Land. The writing quality is so good. And after a few
weeks they began writing to my personality, which they should. The
attention to detail is so good.''
   The McKeands, who are the executive producers, also created
``Family,'' a successful ABC series in the 1970s.
   ``I had no desire to get right back into another series,'' Wopat
says. ``But this show seemed like a wonderful opportunity to get
back to the TV audience. The comment I'm getting from most people
is, `I didn't know you could act.'''
   In ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' he and John Schneider played
cousins Luke and Bo, who never seemed to have anything better to do
than to tear around Hazzard County in the General Lee _ a souped-up
Dodge Charger _ and foil the latest scheme of the corrupt county
politician Boss Jefferson Davis Hogg and the dimwitted Sheriff
Roscoe P. Coltrane.
   After he and Schneider finished work on ``Dukes'' in 1985, Wopat
resumed his musical career that had languished during his TV days.
   ``I focused all of my energy on musical pursuits, both in
Nashville and in New York,'' says Wopat. ``I'm pretty firmly
established in Nashville now. My second album, `Don't Look Back'
from Capital Records, is coming out in July.
   ``When we finished the series I did a revival of `Carousel' in
Washington. Then I did an off-Broadway show called `Olympus on My
Mind,' which is based on a Greek legend. I played the god Jupiter.
While I was doing `Olympus' I got a call to do the `CBS Morning
News.'''
   Wopat says McKeand, who was looking for a lead for ``Blue
Skies,'' happened to see the interview while he was shaving. ``It
was pure dumb luck,'' he says. The two-hour pilot was filmed on
location in Ferndale, a picturesque little town known for its
Victorian architecture near Eureka in Northern California. After he
finished the pilot he went to Nashville to work on his new album.
Then he came back to do seven episodes.
   ``I feel the relationships in the series develop very well,'' he
says. ``That and the strength of the cast give it an awful lot of
potential. Plus, of course, the writing by the McKeands. I play
Frank Cobb, who was a widower with two children who marries a woman
with one child. There are some interesting conflicts with the
children, hers and mine.
   ``I also have some conflict with my father, Henry, played by Pat
Hingle. He's angry that I came back because he wanted me to rise
above his humble beginnings. It's a matter of communication. The
generation gap still exists. There's conflict, but also a lot of
affection.''
   In the final episode of the summer run, his wife, Annie,
discloses that she's pregnant. If the show does well enough in the
ratings (the early ones were so-so) to get a pickup for next
midseason, the arrival _ or imminent arrival _ of a baby will give
them plenty of story material.
   ``We've all extended our contracts to see how it does,'' says
Wopat. ``We're up against `ALF' on NBC and `MacGyver' on ABC. I
think at this time of year there's a good potential for growth. I
think the show gets better as it goes along and the later episodes
will reward people who stick with the show.''
   Last year Wopat was reunited with Schneider for a TV movie,
``Christmas Comes to Willow Creek.'' It was an opportunity for them
to work together again _this time outside their ``Dukes'' roles.
   ``I enjoy working with John,'' says Wopat. ``We feed well off
each other. But we're two completely different actors. I don't mind
doing more work with him. But I think both of us want to show that
we can do more than that.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Red Heat''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Odd-couple crime fighters are much in vogue this summer: the
generation-gap pairs of Sean Penn and Robert Duvall in ``Colors'';
Mark Harmon and Sean Connery in ``The Presidio.''
   Now comes the cultural-gap variety: Arnold Schwarzenegger and
James Belushi in ``Red Heat.''
   It was a nifty notion on the part of Walter Hill (``Southern
Comfort,'' ``48 HRS'') to transport the Dirty Harry of Moscow to
the mean streets of Chicago, and for most of the way, the movie
works on a purely action level. Only in the latter portions does
Hill succumb to the customary overkill of piling one violent action
on another until the viewer is numbed by crashes and shootouts.
   Hill wrote the original story and collaborated on the screenplay
with Harry Kleiner and Troy Kennedy Martin. The impact begins
immediately as Schwarzenegger strides menacingly through a steam
bath filled with hard-muscled men and women. He confronts the
leader of a drug ring, and the battle begins, with head blows that
would kill a full-grown ox.
   The Soviet scenes display a rare verisimilitude since Hill was
allowed to film establishing shots in Red Square and other Moscow
landmarks. Interiors and street scenes were done in Budapest, where
the Eastern European locales and faces also contribute to a sense
of reality. Hill wisely has the actors speak Russian, and English
subtitles explain the dialogue.
   When a vicious drug dealer (Ed O'Ross) escapes to Chicago,
Schwarzenegger insists on permission to track him down. The Soviet
cop is combined with Chicago's most undisciplined detective,
Belushi, and between arguments they pursue the dealer and his
equally brutal confederates.
   Hill is expert at staging gun battles and chases, and he
maintains the excitement most of the way. But excess does not
always succeed, as when Schwarzenegger and his quarry fight a
street duel with Greyhound buses. Such destruction of Chicago real
estate hasn't been seen since John Landis filmed ``The Blues
Brothers.''
   Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the stoic, single-minded
Russian, whose brutal enforcement is leavened with wry one-liners.
Since he says little, his reluctant sidekick Belushi is required to
maintain both sides of their conversations, and he is able and
amusing. Peter Boyle has some good scenes as Belushi's superior. Ed
O'Ross is a real find as the steel-eyed villain.
   ``Red Heat'' is a Tri-Star Picture produced by Hill and Gordon
Carroll. The rating is rightfully R because of language, nudity and
violence. Running time: 103 minutes.

   If your child accidentally swallows a pesticide,
will you know what to do? What if a bee stings you, or while
camping with friends you stomp through a patch of poison ivy.
   Not every one knows instant first aid, but it's one of the most
important things for us to know. A new cassette from MCA Home
Video, ``Dr. Heimlich's Home First Aid,'' gives simple, useful
instructions for everything from poison to burns to bleeding,
choking, bee stings and animal bites.
   Henry Heimlich, the doctor who is credited with the procedure
used for choking victims called the Heimlich Maneuver, developed
the video with home emergencies in mind. He cautions that one
should remain calm in any life-threatening situation.
   ``There's no place for panic in an emergency,'' he says.
   The 36-minute home video will be in stores in September in VHS
and Beta with a suggested retail price of $19.95.
   Also for September from MCA is ``Swing _ The Best of the Big
Bands,'' a wonderful collection of vintage 1940s and 50s film
footage of such artists as Duke Ellington, Nat ``King'' Cole, Tommy
Dorsey, Charlie Barnet, Gene Krupa and Billie Holiday.
   The two-volume package will be available on laser videodisc with
a suggested retail price of $34.98 each.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Moving'' and ``Stranded.''

   ``Moving'' (Warner Home Video; VHS-@Beta, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   Richard Pryor courts Murphy's Law in this crazy glimpse of
middle-class moving woes. Not only does everything go wrong, but
things you'd never dream of also get bent out of shape.
   It all begins when Arlo Pear (Pryor), a milquetoast transit
engineer, must uproot his family from Summit, N.J., and move to
Boise, Idaho, because of a job change.
   He and his wife go out to Boise and house hunt. It's a tedious
task but they finally locate the perfect home. As they admire
various appointments in the house, such as carpeting, art work,
doors, cabinets, sinks, etc., the existing owners jokingly tell
them, ``Yes, but we're taking it with us.''
   It's an ominous joke because when they arrive in Boise, they
find everything including the kitchen sink ripped from the house:
There are no doors, windows, stairs, cabinets, toilets.
   Meanwhile, the movers Pear has hired are right out of
Marat@Sade. These are guys you wouldn't entrust a bag of garbage
let alone your valuables. And the guy he hires to drive his car
West is a looney who changes costumes in every state. The car is
delivered totally stripped with four bald tires.
   But Pear gets pushed too far, and leaves wimpville for
Ramboland. With greasepaint, headband, camouflage fatigues and a
few guns, he takes on the movers, his crooked employer and an
unsavory next-door neighbor played with oozing callousness by Randy
Quaid.
   ``Moving'' reflects the episodic TV writing of Andy Breckman
(``Saturday Night Live,'' ``Late Night With David Letterman''), who
strains credibility with situations that ultimately are absurd and
not very funny.
   Directed by Alan Metter (``Back to School''), ``Moving'' is
rated R.

<TEXT>
   
   ``Stranded'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video; VHS-Beta,
$79.95; Rated PG-13)
   
   There are lots of good guys and bad guys in ``Stranded'' but
it's not too hard to tell them apart. No, they don't wear black
hats and white hats _ they just speak differently. The good guys
talk nice; the bad guys talk mean.
   Caught in the middle is a band of aliens who have fled
persecution on their home planet and seek another and better world.
They're good guys.
   So is the local sheriff, played with intense sensitivity by Joe
Morton (``Brother From Another Planet''). But not many of his
deputies are good. Nor is a government agent.
   The aliens land in the living room of an elderly woman (Maureen
O'Sullivan) and her granddaughter (Ione Skye). After initial
nonsensical mutterings about how this simply can't be happening,
they manage to communicate; a young alien lad even falls in love
with the granddaughter.
   They can't stay on Earth and are being pursued by one of their
world's tormentors. But there's a stand-off at the farmhouse.
   The end is fairly predictable but that doesn't diminish the
effectiveness of ``Stranded.'' It's light entertainment for the
entire family and is rated PG-13 for a few violent and tense
moments.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Age of Glasnost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger can see more of
their hero than usual in ``Red Heat,'' which features an opening
sequence of a near-naked brawl in a Soviet sauna.
   Is this a change of heart for the muscular star whose contracts
give him alone the decision of whether he takes off his shirt _ or
more?
   Not at all, he claims, pointing out that it was important to
establish at the outset his character as Moscow's toughest cop.
   ``One of the things we decided to do was to have this great
sauna scene with naked men and women, where I try to infiltrate
into the Soviet crime organization dealing with drugs,'' he said.
``Like the others, I have nothing on but this little skirt, then
this big fight scene begins with breaking a big window and rolling
down in the snow.''
   Schwarzenegger recalled he had done one other near-naked scene
at the beginning of ``Terminator.''
   ``Whenever the scene calls for nudity and it fits into the
movie, I don't mind that,'' he said. ``But if it is exploiting the
whole idea and is thrown in for no reason, then it bothers me and I
stay away from it.''
   While Sylvester Stallone is fighting the Soviets in ``Rambo
III,'' Schwarzenegger joins them in ``Red Heat.'' As the Moscow
detective, he follows a drug merchant to Chicago and stalks him
with the aid of a local cop, James Belushi. In this glasnost era,
director Walter Hill was able to film in Red Square.
   Schwarzenegger had visited the Soviet Union 10 years ago, and he
was surprised when he returned: ``Amazing changes have taken place.
The people were much more relaxed about their freedom. There are
now privately-owned restaurants in Moscow. I have seen break
dancing, heavy metal rock bands _ all kinds of things I did not see
10 years ago.
   ``The whole idea of an American film company to get permission
to shoot in Red Square, that has never happened before,'' he said.
``We were very fortunate. ... Walter Hill felt it was very
important to create realism in the film, to make the audience feel
that they are in Moscow at the beginning.
   ``Before I went to Russia, I believed that none of my films had
been seen there. Maybe some of the kids would know me because of my
body-building and weight-lifting activities. I was surprised to see
thousands of people coming to Red Square to watch us film, and a
lot of them had videotapes. They were trading them on the black
market, and they were very much aware of `Commando' and `Predator'
and `Terminator.'''
   It's hard to imagine, but Schwarzenegger says that he drew
inspiration for his ``Red Heat'' role from a 1941 Greta Garbo movie.
   ```Ninotchka' was the most important vehicle for me in preparing
for the role,'' he said. ``She plays the same kind of character I
do in `Red Heat.' She is a Russian who comes to Paris very cold. In
the course of the movie, she falls in love with a French guy
(Melvyn Douglas) and whole new emotions are coming out that she was
unaware of. I studied the film very carefully and saw it every day
when we were filming `Red Heat.'''
   Schwarzenegger, who will be 41 on July 30, must be the most
disciplined of movie stars. Not just the body building and all
that. His entire life seems to be minutely calculated, and that
dates back to his beginnings in Graz, Austria. As a boy he was
inspired by seeing American films.
   ``The movies made a tremendous impact on me, especially the John
Wayne war movies,'' he remarked. ``They made me want to come to
America, because he represented America so well.''
   Schwarzenegger used his body to achieve his fame, scoring as Mr.
Olympia seven times. He came to America at 21 with little knowledge
of English. Realizing the need to develop his mind as well as his
body, he read voluminously. Confident of his future earnings, he
studied for a degree in business and international economics at the
University of Wisconsin.
   ``Business has always been something that I liked very much,''
he said, ``dating back to when I managed a health club in Munich at
19. I started running body-building competitions in Europe, and I
was more of a businessman than a body-builder.
   ``When I came to this country and studied business
administration at college, that was very helpful in learning the
American way of doing business. I got into real estate and was very
fortunate. All that is very helpful now, especially when you make
chunks of money in acting and five years later you may be making
nothing.
   ``Acting careers are not like government jobs that last forever.
You're on top one day, then maybe the next day you're not.''
   With the violence-filled vengeance movie seemingly on the wane,
Schwarzenegger is varying his films. Right now he is shooting
``Twins'' for director Ivan Reitman (``Ghostbusters'').
   ``Danny DeVito and I play twins; obviously it's a comedy,'' he
said.
   He will follow with a World War II movie based on the comic
strip ``Sgt. Rock.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Seattle Opera Forsakes Wagner for Philip Glass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forsaking Richard Wagner's classic ``Der Ring des
Niebelungen,'' the Seattle Opera has gone to the opposite extreme
with a production of the minimalist ``Satyagraha'' by Philip Glass.
   Nonetheless, neither the company's general director, Speight
Jenkins, nor Glass expects any backlash from Wagnerians who have
made annual pilgrimages from around the world to annual productions
of the Ring since 1975.
   Only in Bayreuth, Germany, where Wagner built an opera house to
stage his four-part musical epic in 1876, has the Ring been
performed more regularly in modern times.
   With performances set for July 23, 26, 28 and 30, ``Satyagraha''
opens the Seattle company's 25th season and is the first minimalist
opera performance on the West Coast, Jenkins said in an interview.
   ``I've gotten worlds of calls (saying) `We want the Ring back,'
but no calls saying, `We love the Ring, we hate this show, we want
the Ring back,''' he said.
   Why ``Satyagraha,'' an opera in Sanskrit?
   ``We want to prove that opera is not just producing old works in
new and exciting ways,'' Jenkins said.
   ``It illustrates the importance of one good man,'' he said. ``It
illustrates the importance of (the duty of) all of us to improve
the life we have around us.''
   The 19th-century maestro's lavish rendition of a Nordic myth
shows the corrosive force of greed and the redemptive power of love.
   The 20th-century composer's musical portrays Mahatma Gandhi's
years in South Africa as the root of passive resistance and
non-violent activism.
   Both represent major historical developments in opera, Jenkins
said.
   Unlike Wagner's lavish, complex, often explosive scores, Glass
relies on small, often quiet and slowly changing themes to create a
spellbinding effect.
   While Wagner was working in what was then a popular,
well-established medium, Glass has been instrumental in reviving
opera as an outlet for late 20th-century composers, Jenkins said.
   ``He is working on his fifth opera, and all those operas
(completed to date) are playing to full houses,'' he said. ``Philip
Glass operas always sell well.''
   Even now, with Glass and other contemporary composers enjoying
renewed popularity, opera companies hesitate to mount repeat
productions of their work. ``The problem with writing (opera) in
the middle part of the 20th century was that a lot of the composers
were writing for other composers and not for their audiences, and
they admitted it,'' Jenkins explained.
   Glass is one of the leading lights in modern music. Besides his
own small group, the well-traveled Philip Glass Ensemble, he has
written for theater, dance and film, including the sound tracks for
``Koyanisqatsi,'' ``Mishima'' and the recently released
``Powaqqatsi.''
   ``Satyagraha,'' the second and most widely performed of his
operas, was first performed by the Netherlands Opera in 1980. It
was a sellout again at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York
and the Lyric Opera of Chicago last year.
   The Seattle performance features tenor Douglas Perry, who has
had the lead in every performance to date and in a CBS Masterworks
recording; Claudia Cummings, another ``Satyagraha'' veteran of
stage and studio as Gandhi's secretary, and Bruce Ferden, music
director of the Spokane Symphony, who conducted the orchestra in
the world premiere in Rotterdam.
   Glass, who like Gandhi is a vegetarian, said he had long been
inspired by the leader of the independence movement in India and
visited there several times before the opera was commissioned by
Hans De Roo of the Netherlands Opera.
   ``In 1977 the Gandhi film didn't exist yet, so it was kind of a
longshot in a way. Gandhi wasn't in the news, South Africa wasn't
in the news ... but it was something I believed could hold the
stage,'' he said.
   The title combines the words ``satya,'' meaning truth or love,
and ``graha,'' meaning power or force.
   The Sanskrit libretto is based loosely on the Bhagavad Gita, the
Hindu religious text that was Ghandi's lifelong inspiration, rather
than on the action, which is performed in mime.
   Instead of translating the words into English, ``supertitles''
projected onto the stage merely summarize the action.
   ``Oddly enough, this actually makes the whole thing easier,''
Glass said. ``Instead of going to the opera house and trying to
understand what the people are singing, you know right away that
you're not going to understand it ... and then you see the opera
the way I wanted you to.
   ``I wasn't interested in the text, really, but the people had to
sing something,'' he said. ``I wanted the operatic experience to be
completely about the images and music and very little about the
text.
   ``I thought I could relate the story of Gandhi without recourse
or the need of any text.''
   Besides offering a contemporary theme and musical style for the
audience, Glass' productions cost less _ especially compared with
an extravaganza such as the Ring.
   Jenkins said it would cost about $700,000 to mount
``Satyagraha,'' with ticket sales expected to cover about $450,000.
The Boeing Co. has contributed $50,000 and $200,000 remains to be
raised, he said.
   Jenkins said the fate of the Seattle Ring hinges on assuring at
least a 50 percent local share of the roughly $1.2 million in
private and corporate donations needed to supplement ticket sales
for the $2.2 million he figures it would take to revive ``Das
Rheingold,'' ``Die Walkure,'' ``Siegfried'' and ``Die
Gotterdammerung'' next year.
   In the past he has strongly favored staging the Ring every other
year or perhaps in two years out of each three.
   With a bit of a twinkle in his eye, Glass said his own operatic
trilogy of ``Einstein on the Beach,'' ``Satyagraha'' and
``Akhnaten,'' scheduled for a series of performances this fall by
the Stuttgart Opera in Germany, was being labeled by some European
fans as the ``Glass Ring.''
   Does he expect to see the Seattle Opera alternate Rings in
future years?
   ``Worse things could happen,'' he said with a laugh, ``but I'm
not going up against Wagner. Do you think I'm crazy?''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Corey Hart Has Outgrown His Sunglasses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been four years since Corey Hart had a hit
with ``Sunglasses at Night.'' Four long years.
   ``I know when I sing `Sunglasses,' it's like a teen-ager trying
to be cool; it's not me anymore,'' said Hart, who has released his
fourth album, ``Young Man Running.''
   ``I was going on pure adrenaline and energy. I was driven by my
music and driven to succeed by my music. I loved doing it but I
started missing out the day-to-day pleasures of life.''
   Success came early for Hart, who was only 20 at the time of his
debut album, ``First Offense.'' His next record, ``Boy in the
Box,'' sold over a million copies in his native Canada and yielded
a Top 5 single in the United States, ``Never Surrender.''
   ``It was a million times more exciting than I thought it would
be,'' Hart said. ``You can never imagine.''
   But success took its toll on Hart, who found himself losing
control of his life. In the summer of 1987, he collapsed from
mental and physical exhaustion.
   ``By end of the day, if I hadn't crossed the finish line and was
the victor, I would be very dejected and I would be really cursing
myself,'' Hart recalled. ``It was leading to a cyclical destructive
pattern. I started to negate anything I had down, and I was
basically never happy with anything.''
   On the first single from his LP, ``In Your Soul,'' he sings, ``I
have always thought I could run faster than the wind. Count your
blessings, cause it's in your soul.''
   Hart believes ``In Your Soul'' represents a more reflective way
of living.
   ``It's the pivot song,'' he said. ``It weaves itself throughout
the record. You just have to look within yourself to find what you
need. I realized with `In Your Soul' that each day is each day and
you don't necessarily have to achieve your ultimate fulfillment in
one day.''
   ``Chippin' Away,'' the title of one of the songs on the album,
might best sum up Hart's philosophy. He still is anxious to
succeed, but he believes he has become more realistic about
achieving his goals.
   ``Life is the constant pursuit. Whatever the 10 or 15 or three
major ambitions you have in your life, you have to pursue it,''
Hart said. ``It's not that you can reach the ultimate goal. There's
no such thing in life in my opinion.''
   Hart produced or co-produced all the songs on ``Young Man
Running.''
   ``I had a vision for this album,'' he said. ``I wanted to marry
the technological and acoustic together. Only through my eyes could
I achieve that.''
   The music on ``Young Man Running,'' covers a range of styles.
``In Your Soul'' fits comfortably on FM rock stations. ``Chippin'
Away,'' has a relaxed, country feel. ``I thought of Jed Clampett
(on TV's ``The Beverly Hillbillies'') just whittling away. The song
was fun. I think it's really loose.''
   Several songs feature the vocals of Ruby Turner, an English soul
singer. Hart met her through Helen Terry of ``Culture Club'' and
was so impressed by Turner, he rewrote the lyrics of ``Spot You in
a Coalmine,'' so he could include her.
   Hart first wrote `Coalmine' while at the San Remo Song Festival
in Italy.
   ``I was at a hotel where the other bands were staying, one of
those bands was `Duran Duran,''' Hart recalled. ``There were maybe
400 or 500 kids out front, clamoring for `Duran, Duran,' banners
and posters.
   ``Out of the corner of my eye, I saw these three kids holding up
a banner that said, `Corey Hart, We Could Spot You In A Coalmine.'''
   Although Hart is from Canada, he rejects the idea that there is
anything specifically Canadian about his music.
   ``We have `C and W' in Nashville and in Alberta,'' Hart said.
``I think music has no bounderies. I don't like to attribute
anything to being a Canadian artist. It doesn't give me a merit
point.''
   Two songs, ``No Love Lost,'' and ``Crossroad Caravan,'' tell
about the breakup of Hart's parents.
   ``No Love Lost'' is Hart's own interpretation of why the
marriage failed.
   ``It's deception towards another,'' he said. ``It's my
perception as a kid watching them split up and later trying to
figure out what happened.''
   On ``Crossroad Caravan,'' Hart imagines the night when his
mother realizes she can no longer be with his father.
   ``My mom worshiped my father,'' he said. ``I had this image of
her knowing that she was alone and that the marriage had crumbled,
but because she knew that, she was free.''
   Hart will tour in the fall and is aware that many fans will be
anxious to hear `Sunglasses.'
   ``I'm not going to do the song injustice by trashing it because
it's what I was then,'' Hart said. ``But I feel that the audience
has grown up with me, the majority of them.
   ``Anyone listening to Corey Hart can't ever say I wasn't doing
what was true to me.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Back to the Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUMNER, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the late 1960s and early '70s,
thousands of young people fled America's cities with dreams of
subsisting off the land and living simpler lives.
   Many _ perhaps most _ became disillusioned and eventually
returned to more traditional careers in an urban setting.
   One who stuck with the dream and turned it into a life of
contentment was Terry Silber, who gave up her high-powered job as
art director for The Atlantic Monthly, left Boston and attempted to
eke out a living on the abandoned western Maine farm she had
purchased on a whim in 1965.
   In ``A Small Farm in Maine'' (Houghton Mifflin $17.95), Silber
tells how she and her husband, Mark, a Russian-born nature
photographer, turned that rundown property from a weekend retreat
to the centerpiece of a self-sustaining business, one that now
embraces horticulture, crafts, teaching and writing.
   Some may view the book as a no-nonsense guide for anyone who
nurtures similar dreams of cutting loose from urban connections and
becoming self-supporting on the farm.
   ``It's how to get rid of the mythologies and face the realities
of coming to the country,'' the 47-year-old Silber said in an
interview.
   But more than that, it's a personal memoir of an energetic,
intelligent and resourceful woman whose abiding love for the land
has intensified with each passing year.
   ``This very ordinary piece of land has become my home, my
office, my laboratory, and on it I am able to work, play, study and
live, all the while enjoying an environment that is so beautiful,
so stimulating and so seductive that I have become unfit to live
elsewhere,'' Silber writes.
   The book was the brainchild of editor Richard Todd, her former
colleague at the Atlantic and a part-time farmer himself. Todd
maintained there was a story in the atypical success of an urban
dropout who went back to the land and actually stayed.
   Initially cool to the idea _ she insists she's a visual person,
not a writer _ Silber finally relented once she was sure her
family's agricultural future was secure.
   ``I came reluctantly to it,'' she said. ``I got to the point in
the development of this place where I thought, `We're here, I know
we're here, I know we're here for the duration.'''
   From rank amateurs who sought out neighbors' advice on planting
such commonplace crops as corn and tomatoes, the Silbers have
become recognized experts whose assortments of herbs and flowers
are among the most varied and unusual.
   The childlike delight they once took in watching a newly-seeded
row of beans push up through the soil has given way to a
familiarity with hundreds upon hundreds of herbal varieties whose
names border on the unpronounceable.
   The Silbers have turned Hedgehog Hill Farm into a horticultural
showplace. Thousands of visitors each year buy seedlings or dried
flowers and herbs, attend classes on subjects ranging from
basketmaking to floral design or simply revel in the Silbers'
botanical paradise.
   The couple have become experts in production of everlastings,
the dried flowers and herbs that account for a large share of their
mail-order and retail store sales; they are collaborating on a
comprehensive and lavishly illustrated guide to everlastings due
for publication later this year.
   Such value-added products have helped to make the farm a
success, and Silber hesitates when asked if she and her husband
could have survived on market gardening alone.
   ``I play with that question a lot,'' she said. ``I really don't
know.''
   Of the 160 acres that the Silbers now own, only 10 acres have
been cleared and no more than three are ever under cultivation. But
their farming is extremely intensive, making use of greenhouses,
raised beds and black plastic sheets to spur crop growth and
control weeds.
   Silber's feelings for the farm, expressed eloquently in the
book, are evident as she paces its walkways and strolls between
rows of plants, savoring the soft spring rain that intensifies the
lush green of her surroundings.
   ``I love working on the land,'' she said, explaining how she and
her husband have had to scale back the business for fear it would
turn them into full-time administrators with litle time to work in
the fields. Nine people, including the Silbers themselves, work at
the farm.
   She says her love of physical labor _ ``you work harder than
you've ever worked in your life'' _ was one of the factors that
allowed her to succeed where so many other back-to-the-landers had
failed.
   Perhaps the most important factor, however, was the gradual
process by which the Silbers weaned themselves from their urban
support systems and moved slowly and deliberately along the path
toward rural self-sufficiency.
   While others uprooted themselves abruptly and came to the
country with little more than a romanticized vision as a guide,
Silber continued initially to take on consulting work in order to
supplement the income she and her husband earned from selling
produce at farmers' markets after they became full-time Maine
residents in 1977.
   For seven years prior to their move, the couple led a double
life, spending weekends on the farm before returning to their
Boston jobs Tuesday morning and dashing back to their country
retreat after work on Friday.
   Ironically, Silber's farm odyssey has taken her almost full
circle from the region in which she grew up. She was born in
Lewiston, a mill city just 20 miles from here, and lived in five
states, two foreign countries and more than two dozen apartments
and houses before returning to Maine.
   The decision to become a full-time organic farmer represented an
aesthetic choice, she said, rather than a moral or an ethical one.
   ``You have to find out if the rewards that you want are really
the rewards that a rural life offers. Luckily, for Mark and me they
are; they are aesthetic, sensual and for us extremely intellectual
in that we have so much to learn,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Steve Winwood Back in the High Life</HEAD>
<HEAD>By SHERA GROSS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 25 years after he hit the British
pop music scene as a teen-age vocalist, Steve Winwood is
recapturing the popularity of his youth with the help of Nashville
and Memphis session men.
   The Grammy award-winning artist's new album and hit single of
the same name, ``Roll With It,'' hark back to his days in the
mid-1960s with the rhythm and blues-styled Spencer Davis Group.
   The move to Tennessee, he says, gave him the chance to go back
to his musical roots on the new album.
   ``It certainly reflects the fact that I've been in Tennessee,''
Winwood said in an interview. ``It has a Memphis feel to a lot of
the songs. Since I've been down here I've had a strong interest in
the musical history of the area.''
   Winwood had his first taste of stardom at the age of 16 when he
was the lead vocalist on the Spencer Davis Group's hit ``Gimme Some
Lovin.''' He later had stints with Traffic and Blind Faith before
going on to a solo career.
   Two recent albums, ``Arc of a Diver'' and ``Back in the High
Life,'' went platinum, and the single ``Higher Love'' from the
latter won Winwood Grammys for record of the year and best male pop
vocalist in 1986.
   He calls his latest release a ``happy album.''
   ``There's nothing melancholic about it,'' he said.
   Winwood credits several factors for the upbeat mood of the LP.
   ``At 40 years old, I'm having the best album and the best part
of my career that I've ever had. I'm also very happily married and
I have a beautiful little girl,'' he said.
   Winwood married Eugenia Crafton of Nashville in January 1987.
They have a baby daughter, Mary Clare, and keep homes in Nashville
and Britain.
   On his latest work he tapped trumpeter Wayne Jackson and
saxophonist Andrew Love of the Memphis Horns for the album.
Nashville's Mike Lawler plays keyboards and Michael Rhodes plays
bass on the album and during Winwood's 31-city tour this summer.
   Winwood loves the rhythm-and-blues sound that first made him
popular with the Spencer Davis Group and he still listens to it.
But when asked if a reunion was possible, the veteran rocker said
it isn't likely.
   ``There are no plans at all for a reunion. I couldn't say it
isn't entirely impossible but my brother (former band mate Muff)
hasn't played bass in 10 to 12 years,'' he said.
   ``Roll With It'' has a distinctive rhythm-and-blues sound that
comes with the gutsy brass of the Memphis Horns and the bop of the
Hammond B-3 organ. Winwood is unsure if renewed interest in the
blues among American audiences is contributing to his success.
   ``I'm never quite sure about audiences,'' he said. ``I am
getting more influenced by rhythm and blues. But about audiences, I
don't really know. I tend to think it's a mistake to aim for a
certain audience.''
   Though he now lives and works in the country music capital of
the world, Winwood seemed a bit surprised by the diversity of
musicians available. He plans to collaborate with more Nashville
musicians although he hasn't decided who.
   ``I will use, and am using, musicians from Nashville, but I
don't think it will have the obvious effect. I won't be using a
fiddle player or steel guitar,'' he joked. ``But there are great
musicians here not only in the country field but great rock 'n'
roll players.
   ``I don't think it will affect the music so much. It won't
affect the writing. Wherever I go it usually comes out sounding
like a Steve Winwood album.''

<TEXT>
   Zapping fresh foods with radiation may
increase their shelf life and make them safer to eat. But the
notion of eating irradiated fruits, vegetables and meats leaves a
bad taste in some mouths.
   Despite claims by some scientists, the federal government and
others that irradiation is a safe way to rid foods of bacteria,
microorganisms or insects, anti-nuclear activists and other
scientists insist it can harm people.
   The process involves running produce on a conveyor belt around a
radiation source for a few seconds or minutes. Eighteen-inch long
rods containing either cobalt 60 or cesium 137 treat the foods
without raising their temperature. When not in use, the rods are
immersed in water as a safety precaution.
   X-rays and gamma rays break chemical bonds and ``either disrupt
the ongoing process of decay or any contaminant on the food,'' said
Christine Bruhn, consumer food marketing specialist with the
University of California Cooperative Extension at Davis.
   Supporters say food does not become radioactive at the doses
used and is safe to handle and eat immediately after irradiation.
They say it can extend shelf life of some produce and meats and rid
pork of dangerous parasites.
   ``Scientists say it is safer than products contaminated with
microorganisms or mold or some chemically approved products,'' Ms.
Bruhn said.
   Opponents contend that studies showing adverse effects have been
ignored or suppressed. One found chromosome damage in humans four
weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat, said Denis
Mosgofian, director of the San Francisco-based Coalition to Stop
Food Irradiation.
   ``Irradiation of food actually changes the food, rearranges its
chemistry, creates new chemicals, many of which are toxic,''
Mosgofian said. ``Irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to
produce adverse health effects to both animals and humans who
consumed it.''
   Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., introduced legislation in March to
rescind a 1986 ruling by the Food and Drug Administration allowing
the sale of irradiated foods. He also called for a National Academy
of Sciences study of the process.
   Bosco said he wanted ``any new technology proven safe before it
is allowed to permeate our food chain.''
   Ms. Bruhn acknowledged that scientists have found a meat product
that produced a ``unique radiolytic product'' when irradiated.
``The important thing is does that make it toxic? The indication is
that it does not,'' she said.
   Concern also has been raised that irradiation might allow
mutations of bacterias or viruses, but a World Health Organization
study turned up none. ``It could happen in the future,'' Ms. Bruhn
said. ``It's unlikely.''
   Irradiated food is rare at U.S. supermarkets, partly because
fumigation is cheaper. But the process is used to sterilize medical
equipment at 40 plants in the United States, and some spices are
irradiated to kill microbes.
   The Washington Apple Commission has received thousands of
letters in what officials say seems to be an organized campaign
expressing concern that apples will be treated at an irradiation
research center the U.S. Department of Energy plans to build at

   ``An irradiated apple a day keeps the consumer away,'' said one.
   Commission spokesman Charles St. John said Washington apples
will not be irradiated, even though the process would kill codling
moth larvae that keep large amounts of fruit out of the Japanese
market. ``The Japanese have told us they are not going to accept
irradiation, so it is a moot point,'' he said.
   Ms. Bruhn said most California consumers are undecided. ``Some
want to avoid them; others want to buy them. In any case, they all
want to be able to make an informed choice.''

   For decades, breast cancer meant mastectomy, but
Rosanne Forziano had her cancer removed in December while keeping
her breast.
   It's easy to assume that with her tumor gone without
disfigurement, her problems were over _ but that's not the story
that emerges from Forziano and other members of an unusual support
group for ``lumpectomy'' patients.
   ``What is devastating to you is that you had cancer,'' says
Forziano, 34. ``It's gone now but will it come back, and where will
it come back?''
   Lumpectomy patients are not alone among cancer patients in
worrying about recurrance. But Forziano and other group members say
the shared surgical experience helps in discussing that issue and
others.
   Having chosen lumpectomy, ``I want to be with women who made
that kind of choice,'' says ``Sarah,'' a woman in her mid-50s who
asked that her real name not be used. ``These are the people who
know what this is about.''
   Nancy Denton, a social worker who works with lumpectomy groups
at Long Island Jewish Hospital, says many people fail to realize
that patients whose breasts have been spared still need emotional
support.
   ``They are looked at by society, by their family members, by a
lot of the medical profession as `Here they are, they have their
whole breast intact so they don't need anything.'
   ``In fact, the bottom line is that they have breast cancer. That
in itself warrants some attention.''
   Support groups specifically for lumpectomy patients are unusual.
Most are for breast cancer patients in general or even cancer
patients in general.
   The Long Island hospital plans four lumpectomy groups a year,
each running six weeks. The one that included Forziano had a dozen
members.
   Lumpectomies account for maybe 20 to 25 percent of breast cancer
surgeries and ``it's definitely on the increase,'' says Dr. David
Winchester, medical director of the cancer department of the
American College of Surgeons.
   The surgery is used on small tumors. Then the breast is
irradiated five times a week for about six weeks. Chemotherapy also
may be required.
   The radiation treatments involve the strain not only of daily
trips to the hospital, but also of seeing radiation patients who
are doing poorly, says Forziano. ``You say to yourself, `Is that
going to be me next year?'''
   The support group lets members discuss such feelings, as well as
anger at what cancer has done to their lives and the pressure to be
stoic around their families, says Denton. Meetings also include
lessons in stress management, exercise and breast self-examination.
   One payoff, says ``Sarah,'' is ``being able to encourage each
other to allow family and friends to really be there in an
emotional, supportive way.
   ``I still come out feeling most of the time that I'm lucky ...
to have had it found early, have been able to keep my breast, and
be with other women who know what that's about.''

   Takehiko Furusawa, an engineer specializing in a
technological field with potential military application, says there
is a definite change under way in Japan regarding freedom of
information.
   ``Research results here used to be completely open, but since
Eastern bloc countries have used our technology for military
purposes we've had to close off conferences and the flow of
information in a number of fields,'' said the University of Tokyo
professor.
   In the wake of last year's scandal involving exports of
sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, Japan has moved with
uncharacteristic speed to clamp down on strategic exports and cut
off access to information on sensitive technology, like the carbon
composite materials Furusawa specializes in.
   But Washington, which regards Tokyo as lax, has called on Japan
to make a bigger commitment in a strategic new agreement on
scientific and technological cooperation, concluded in June after
10 months of negotiations.
   Japan bowed to U.S. pressure and agreed to limit the publication
of U.S.-Japan technology with possible military application.
Japanese officials also agreed that they would control the flow of
informarchers spotted
the Spadefoot, or Scaphiopus bombifrons, which is common in lower
areas east of the Laramie Mountains.
   The Spadefoot is difficult to study because it can burrow as
much as 15 feet into moist soil and stay there up to six years,
said William Gern, head of the university's zoology-physiology
department. Why they re-emerge is unknown.

<HEAD>Japan Agrees It's Time To Repay A Science Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks between Japan and the United States have
focused on balancing trade between the countries, but haven't
ignored the fact that Japan has built its technological edge on the
foundations of Western science.
   Under a pact signed last month by President Reagan and Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, Japan will spend $4 million to invite
U.S. scientists and engineers to the country, open research
laboratories to Americans and boost the number of foreigners
invited on scholarships from 28 to 200.
   Washington has demanded more research funding and a commitment
to balance the flow of researchers and information, getting tough
as critics, particularly U.S. industry, call for an end to what
they say has been Japan's free ride.
   The Japan Center at the University of North Carolina estimates
that 15,000 Japanese students and researchers enter U.S.
institutions a year, five times the number of Americans who come to
Japan.
   Leading Japanese scientists, many of whom have studied or worked
in America, agree that the time has arrived for Japan to repay its
debt.
   ``My generation has all gone to the United States to study.
Japan just preaches about international cooperation, but it really
has to start putting out more funds ... like the U.S. government
which has spent so much over the years,'' Tokyo University
Professor Shoji Tanaka, one of the world's leading
superconductivity researchers, said in an interview.
   Hiroshi Inose, head of the National Center for Science
Information System and inventor of the digital telephone switch
when he was a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and Bell
Telephone in the late 1950s, agrees.
   ``I have repeatedly told the government that the United States
has spent a great deal to invite Japanese scientists and engineers
on Fulbright scholarships... I don't think we ever reciprocated for
that.''
   The U.S.-Japan Agreement on Cooperation in Science and
Technology was first signed in 1980 to promote basic research in
non-energy areas. It was renewed five times since 1985 and, after
10 months of negotiations ending in June, officials agreed to a new
pact effective until 1993.
   In Tokyo, however, the feeling pervades that Japan is being
forced to comply with a pact of benefit only to Washington. ``To us
in Japan it appears we are under the pressure of the U.S.
government,'' Inose said.
   And American researchers are ``afraid of being left behind by
their colleagues back home,'' said Nagahide Onozawa, who will
oversee 100 foreign researchers under the governmental Japan
Society for the Promotion of Science.
   Tokyo University's Tanaka, head of the new International
Superconductivity Technology Center, questions U.S. intentions.
Tanaka found no takers when he tried recently to interest American
companies in the project. In addition, the U.S. government has
closed off symposiums on superconductivity to foreigners while
citing the field as one for joint research in the bilateral pact.

<HEAD>Experts Disagree Whether Safe or Dangerous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zapping fresh foods with radiation may
increase their shelf life and make them safer to eat. But the
notion of eating irradiated fruits, vegetables and meats leaves a
bad taste in some mouths.
   Despite claims by some scientists, the federal government and
others that irradiation is a safe way to rid foods of bacteria,
microorganisms or insects, anti-nuclear activists and other
scientists insist it can harm people.
   The process involves running produce on a conveyor belt around a
radiation source for a few seconds or minutes. Eighteen-inch-long
rods containing cobalt 60 or cesium 137 treat the foods without
raising their temperature. When not in use, the rods are immersed
in water as a safety precaution.
   X-rays and gamma rays break chemical bonds and ``either disrupt
the ongoing process of decay or any contaminant on the food,'' said
Christine Bruhn, consumer food marketing specialist with the
University of California Cooperative Extension at Davis.
   Supporters say food does not become radioactive at the doses
used and is safe to handle and eat immediately after irradiation.
They say it can extend shelf life of some produce and meats and rid
pork of dangerous parasites.
   Opponents contend that studies showing adverse effects have been
ignored or suppressed. One found chromosome damage in humans four
weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat, said Denis
Mosgofian, director of the San Francisco-based Coalition to Stop
Food Irradiation.
   ``Irradiation of food actually changes the food, rearranges its
chemistry, creates new chemicals, many of which are toxic,''
Mosgofian said. ``Irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to
produce adverse health effects to both animals and humans who
consumed it.''
   Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., introduced legislation in March to
rescind a 1986 ruling by the Food and Drug Administration allowing
the sale of irradiated foods. He also called for a National Academy
of Sciences study of the process.
   Irradiated food is rare at U.S. supermarkets, partly because
fumigation is cheaper. But the process is used to sterilize medical
equipment at 40 plants in the United States, and some spices are
irradiated to kill microbes.

<HEAD>New Eye Chart Could Unmask Eye Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors will be able to unmask eye disease
in its earliest stages with a new chart that uses progressively
disappearing letters to measure ability to distinguish tones, its
designers say.
   ``It is reasonable to think that many would not become blind or
would become blind later in life because of this enhancement of our
early detection tools,'' said neuroscientist Denis G. Pelli, one of
the inventors of the Pelli-Robson Letter Sensitivity Chart.
   The new chart will provide a more efficient method of diagnosing
serious eye problems, Pelli said during its recent unveiling at
Syracuse University's Institute for Sensory Research. The chart is
being used in two nationwide trials sponsored by the National Eye
Institute and is set for general distribution to doctors this
August.
   Unlike the traditional Snellen chart found in most doctors'
offices, with its shrinking letters, the Pelli-Robson Chart uses an
even-sided block with six character lines of four-inch high
letters. The Pelli-Robson letters gradually fade from solid black
to gray and then melt into the whitewash background.
   ``The traditional eye chart is very effective in prescribing
eyeglasses, but it is a poor detector of most eye diseases,'' said
John G. Robson, a professor in neurophysiology at Cambridge
University, England.
   Robson and his colleagues found that many eye diseases are
preceded by a loss in the ability to perceive contrast. Eyesight,
as measured by traditional charts, may withstand the effects of
disease longer.
   Available methods of measuring contrast sensitivity are complex,
time consuming or unreliable, said Robson.
   The inventors hope their chart will let doctors identify
cataracts, glaucoma, myopia, macular degeneration, optic neuritis
and diabetic retinopathy in earlier stages.
   ``We are desperately in need of new devices,'' said Dr. John
Hoepner, chairman of the ophthalmology department at the State
University of New York Medical Center here. ``We know that were not
really measuring functional disability and picking out disease with
these older techniques.
   ``The use of contrast sensitivity is exciting to us.''

   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
light European trading early today as the market awaited the return
of New York dealers after the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers in Rome said the dollar slipped in mainly technical
dealings in Asia but that the European market was trying to bid it
higher. However, the dollar was being pressed by light but repeated
dollar sales by the West German central bank, the Bundesbank.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain relatively
stable before U.S. merchandise trade figures for May are announced
in mid-July.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.55 Japanese yen to a closing 134.30
yen. Later, in London, it was unchanged at 134.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8217 West German marks, down from 1.8295; 1.5155
Swiss francs, down from 1.5233; 6.1355 French francs, down from
6.1593; 2.0531 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0575; 1,352.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,353.25; and 1.2160 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2215.
   In London, the British pound jumped to $1.7020 from $1.6825 late
Monday. British commercial banks on Monday announced another
half-percentage point increase in their base lending rate to 10
percent in an effort to stem sterling's five-week slide.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $437.50 a troy ounce, up
from $437.25 bid late Monday. At mid-morning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $437.40.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $437.40, down from $437.50 bid
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $440.41
from $439.64 bid at Monday's close.
   Silver bullion edged higher in London to a bid price of $6.74 a
troy ounce from $6.73 bid late Monday.

   Stock prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today
as markets expanded and the yen strengthened against the dollar,
traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 27,577.17 yen, up
216.78 yen, or 0.79 percent. It opened trading at 27,360.39, and
within an hour rose to 27,427.95.
   The dollar closed the day's session at 134.30 yen, down 0.55 yen
from Monday's close.
   The U.S. currency opened at 135.24 yen, the dollar's highest
opening rate since last Nov. 10, when the dollar rose briefly to

   King Ogino, a foreign exchange trader for Goldman Sachs in
Tokyo, attributed the rise in the stock market to the yen's rise.
   ``The mood seems to be lightening, based on the yen's
strength,'' he said.
   Nick Gunner, a trader for Vickers da Costa, said the yen rose
because of comments from Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that the
yen will not get much weaker, implying that there was a lid on how
low Japan would let the yen go.
   ``Traders see the dollar possibly getting weaker, which means
the downside for the dollar is greater,'' he said.
   He said stock prices rose because of expansion by buyers into
new sectors such as heavy electricals.

   Stock prices were slightly higher Tuesday amid

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 4.3

   An attempt to defraud the London branch of the
Union Bank of Switzerland of $53 million has been thwarted, police
reported.
   The City of London Police said in a brief statement Monday night
the attempted fraud involved the transfer of money from London to
the Swiss town of Nyon through a computer-based switching system.
   The police statement gave few other details but the British
domestic news agency Press Association said it understood police
were alerted after the transfer of the money triggered a
computerized alarm at the bank in Switzerland.
   However, the London newspaper the Daily Telegraph said it was
believed a failure in the computer system in Zurich stopped the
transfer being completed before it was discovered.
   The Daily Telegraph said the company fraud department of the
City of London Police was called in by the bank last Wednesday.
   Police said persons in London and Switzerland were being
questioned.
   The City of London Police is a small force which polices the
City, London's financial district. It operates separately from the
larger Metropolitan Police force, which polices the rest of London.

subcompact car in the United States late last year, is considering
sales of minicars in the U.S. market, officials said Tuesday.
   Minicars, defined by the industry as cars with an engine
capacity smaller than 550 cubic centimeters, are largely aimed at
Japan's domestic market and have not been aggressively marketed
outside the country.
   Daihatsu officials said the company is considering marketing the
Leeza, a 550-cubic centimeter car, in the United States.
   However, it would be several years before the Leeza would be
available to American car buyers because the cars would require
technical modifications to handle U.S. driving conditions,
officials said.
   If successful, however, Daihatsu would become the first Japanese
carmaker in about 20 years to sell minicars in the U.S.
   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars, tried in
the late 1960s but sold only a small number of minicars.

   The stock market edged lower today as traders
returned from a long holiday weekend keen on cashing in on some
profits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 4.80 to 2,126.78 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 292 up, 639 down and
452 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.79 million sharesas of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts attributed the lower opening to profit-taking in the
wake of a lower bond market opening and Friday's lackluster
equities trading session. The stock market was closed Monday for
the Independence Day holiday.
   Today's session is the first opportunity the market had to react
to the weekend downing of an Iranian passenger plane by the U.S.
Navy. But analysts said the incident would not be a key focus.
   ``The market will take it as an international incident,'' said
Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   He noted that the oil and precious metals markets, which are
most sensitive to such global news, had no response, and therefore
``to attribute the weakness in the Dow to that (incident) would be
missing the point.''
   Mirroring activity in the previous session, utility stocks
dominated the most active issues on the Big Board, with Delmar
Power and Light unchanged at 18{; Boston Edison unchanged at 15\;
Pacific Telesis up [ at 29{, and Southwestern Bell down | at 38\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.37 to 153.31. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.98 at 308.02.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 10.13 points
to 2,131.58.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 617 up, 848 down and 473 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 238.33 million shares, against 227.41 million shares in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Taiwan's Trade Surplus Grows In June From May, But Down From Year
Earlier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan's surplus with the United States increased
29 percent to $839 million in June from $652 million in May,
although it was still 48 percent below the surplus of $1.61 billion
in June 1987, the government said Tuesday.
   It was the third month in a row Taiwan has posted an increased
trade surplus with the United States after eight months of decline.
   Overall, Taiwan posted a $1.38 billion trade surplus in June,
the highest level of the year but still less than a year earlier,
the government said.
   The overall June surplus was 23.7 percent higher than the May
surplus of $1.12 billion, but 23.6 percent below the surplus of
$1.81 billion in June 1987, according to the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.
   Taiwan's trade surplus for the year's first six months came to
$4.54 billion, down 50.1 percent from the same period last year.
   Exports in June totaled $5.29 billion, up 6.7 percent from a
year ago, and imports reached $3.91 billion, up 22.1 percent.
   Trade officials associated the larger overall monthly surplus
mainly with stable New Taiwan dollar that drew many orders back to
local manufacturers.
   The Taiwan dollar, after two years of appreciation in value
against the U.S. currency, has remained stable since the start of
the year.
   Another factor in the larger monthly surplus was a reduction in
Taiwan's imports of gold bullion from the United States, the
island's largest trading partner, although precise June figures
were not immediately available, officials said.

<HEAD>Koppers Selling Chemicals Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. executives said today they and
veteran chemical industry financier Gordon Cain have signed a
letter of intent to buy Koppers' chemicals and related businesses
for $660 million.
   The managers, with Cain's Sterling Group of Houston as an equity
financing partner, expect to close the sale by Aug. 5.
   Cain will serve as chairman, and Glen Tenley, who was president
and chief operating officer of Koppers, will serve as president and
chief executive of the business, to be known as Koppers Chemical
Co. The new company, with about 4,000 employees, will remain
headquartered in Pittsburgh.
   The deal was negotiated with BNS Inc., a takeover group composed
of British industrialist Brian Beazer, the Wall Street investment
bank Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank.
   BNS completed a $1.8 billion tender offer for Koppers June 15
after a long, bitter fight by Koppers to remain independent.
   Beazer wanted Koppers for its building materials businesses,
which he added to his own international operations in the same
industry. He had intended to sell the chemicals and related
businesses, which have annual sales of about $600 million, to help
finance the takeover, and he gave the Pittsburgh-based managers
exclusive right to negotiate for the units.
   The 6-year-old Sterling Group has completed 20 leveraged
buyouts, about one-third in the chemical industry. Tenley, 60, is a
33-year veteran of the chemicals business.
   ``Our cash flow is strong, and the outlook for the Koppers
chemical business is good,'' Tenley said in a statement.
   ``We are confident of our ability to grow to a $1 billion sales
organization by the early 1990s, and we will add that growth
through expansion of quality programs in our businesses and by
serving our customer base with new products and services,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States continued to fluctuate this week, increasing by 27 to
total 921, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Tuesday.
   During the previous week, the rig count had dropped by 11 to
total 894, the company said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
The rig count totaled 872 a year ago.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana had the biggest gain
with nine, followed by Michigan, four; Colorado and Oklahoma, two
each; and New Mexico and Wyoming, one each.
   Kansas and Texas reported a drop of two each while California
and North Dakota each decreased by one.
   Ohio and Pennsylvania did not change from the previous week.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese Cabinet gave its formal approval
Tuesday to agreements with the United States and Australia aimed at
easing curbs on imports of beef and citrus fruits from those
nations, a Foreign Ministry official said.
   The approval was given during a regular Cabinet meeting,
clearing the way for a gradual loosening of Japan's import curbs on
the agricultural items, according to the official, who demanded
anonymity.
   Japan's restrictions on beef and citrus fruits was a hotly
contested issue among the three nations, with both the United
States and Australia threatening to take their case to the General
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, an international body based in
Geneva that sets trade rules and offers a forum for resolving
disputes.
   Japan escaped a GATT battle in mid-June by reaching separate
bilateral agreements with the two countries.
   On June 20, the Japanese government acceded to U.S. demands to
phase out quotas blocking beef imports over a three-year period
beginning 1991. Farm Minister Takashi Sato signed a similar
agreement with Australian officials in Canberra on June 24.
   Also beginning in 1991, Japan will permit unlimited imports of
U.S. oranges, but subject to the current tariff rates of 40 percent
in season and 20 percent off season.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today amid
investor apathy following the long holiday weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 0.53 at 2,131.05
in the first hour and a half of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 534 up, 627 down and
488 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 49.77 million shares as of 11

   There was some initial profit-taking in the wake of a lower bond
market and Friday's lackluster equities trading session. But one
trader characterized activity as ``more apathetic than anything
else _ the market is trying to shrug off holiday cobwebs.''
   Traders noted that with the beginning of the new quarter,
portfolio managers have to identify new investments. But first they
are likely to monitor the direction of the dollar, the trade
deficit numbers and unemployment.
   ``Those (investment) decisions aren't made in a day,'' a trader
said.

   Ford Motor Co. has raised prices of its
Probe models an average of about $200, the company said Tuesday.
   The increases took effect Friday. The Probe was introduced in
May. The two-door coupes are designed by Ford, jointly engineered
by Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. and manufactured for Ford at Mazda's
plant at Flat Rock.
   Robert L. Rewey, vice president for North American sales
operations, said the increases were necessary because production
costs rose.
   The manufacturers suggested retail price of the basic Probe GL
rose to $10,660 from $10,459, the Probe LX to $11,644 from $11,443
and the Probe GT to $13,794 from $13,593. Destination and delivery
charges were increased to $279 from $252.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Higher, Quickly Turn Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices turned sharply
lower today after opening higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders and analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking in
the wake of the National Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day
outlook, which predicted above-normal rainfall in key growing areas
late this week and early next week.
   Substantial weekend rains in the Southeast and extreme Northern
Plains also pressured the markets, analysts said.
   But prices appeared to be rebounding at midmorning after the
early gyrations.
   Jerry Gidel, an analyst with the G.H. Miller Division of
British-owned trading company LIT America Inc., said some private
meteorologists disagreed with the National Weather Service
prediction, and expect continued hot and dry conditions for the
drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   ``People are feeling the weather scenario hasn't changed that
drastically yet,'' Gidel said.
   In early trading, wheat was 13 cents to 18 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.84 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 5{ cents higher with July at $3.42 a bushel; oats were 3 cents
to 15 cents lower with July at $3.20 a bushel; soybeans were 11
cents to 25 cents lower with July at $9.64 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while most pork futures were
sharply lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .50 cent higher with August at
64.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .80 cent higher
with August at 73.97 cents a pound; hogs were .72 cent lower to
1.18 cents higher with July at 44.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .72 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 33.75 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday while pork futures were
sharply lower.

<HEAD>Iran Airliner Crisis Has Only Mild Impact on Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices rose only slightly today in reaction
to the U.S. destruction of an Iranian jetliner over the Persian
Gulf, and traders said they did not think the crisis marked a big
threat to supplies from that region.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a key barometer of prices,
the August-delivery price for West Texas Intermediate crude was up
only 13 cents per 42-gallon barrel to $15.07 by late this morning.
   ``The expectations are that the Iranians aren't going to take
any action that threaten oil supplies,'' said Jayne Ball, an
energy-futures trader at the investment firm of Dean Witter
Reynolds in New York. ``If they were, the market would have been up
a dollar here. The market already has figured out that's not going
to happen.''
   Some said that because the incident happened Sunday and the
Iranians had not retaliated, U.S. oil-market strategists had more
than a day to consider the risks before domestic trading resumed,
which lessened the chances of any drastic reaction. The market was
closed Monday for the Fourth of July holiday.
   Others said the market did not react strongly to the crisis
because excessive supplies have been overwhelming demand recently,
pushing prices down to the lowest level of the year.
   A key reason is that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which once controlled prices, has failed to enforce
production discipline among its members, which are increasingly
violating output restraints.
   ``I think the reaction here is muted because of overwhelming
concern about the fundamentals,'' said Stephen Smith, an oil
analyst at Bear Stearns Cos. in New York.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today in
light trading amid investor apathy following the long holiday
weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.78 at 2,133.36
by midday.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 572 up, 638 down and
516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.78 million shares as of noon

   There was some initial profit-taking in the wake of higher
interest rates in the credit markets and Friday's lackluster
equities trading session. But one trader characterized activity as
``more apathetic than anything else _ the market is trying to shrug
off holiday cobwebs.''
   Traders anticipated light volume as some key decision makers
have extended their holiday weekend and since portfolio managers
have yet to pick their investments for the new quarter. ``Those
decisions aren't made in a day,'' a trader noted.
   Because the stock market was closed Monday for the Independence

   Mirroring activity in the previous session, utility stocks
dominated the most active issues on the Big Board, with Delmar
Power and Light up [ at 18|; Boston Edison down [ at 15[; Pacific

<HEAD>Little-Known Company Assembles Laser Disk System For Data Storage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Getting a jump on bigger rivals, a 4-year-old
company has put together a system that allows personal computers to
use rewritable laser disks for storing huge quantities of
information.
   Rewritable laser disks are considered part of the future of the
computer business. They are close cousins of the compact disks used
for music, except they are set up for computer information and can
be erased and written on repeatedly.
   The system assembled by New York-based Advanced Graphic
Applications Inc. is the first of its kind on the U.S. market, said
Ed Rothchild, chairman of Rothchild Associates, a San
Francisco-based consulting firm.
   Advanced Graphic Applications, which buys the components from
other companies, wrote software that allows the data-storage
devices to be connected easily to personal computers using the
popular MS-DOS operating system.
   ``It's significant that they're offering a plug-and-play
solution,'' Rothchild said. But, he added, ``They will have lots of
competitors.''
   For now, the 40-employee company has a jump on companies such as
Sony Corp., Maxtor Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.'s Verbatim unit,
which have not put together complete systems that are ready for
sale.
   Sharp Corp. announced a complete system in December, but only
for the Japanese market, Rothchild said. He said some companies may
be hanging back, waiting to see what industry standards develop.
   Rewritable laser disks are capable of storing 650 megabytes of
data, or nearly 300,000 typewritten pages of information, which is
many times more than can be held on fixed hard disks. Moreover,
unlike hard disks they can be taken out and used in other computers.
   The laser disk drives already on the market, led by
International Business Machines Corp.'s top-selling model, can
write information once but cannot erase and rewrite. IBM's model is
made for it by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   The disk drive in the new Discus Rewritable system is made by
Olympus Corp. of Japan and the disks themselves are made by
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
   Advanced Graphic Applications said it was taking orders on the
$4,995 system for November delivery.

   Some facts and figures on Guyana.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Guianas, a region that today includes Suriname,
French Guiana, Guyana and parts of Brazil and Venezuela, was
sighted by Columbus in 1498, but Guyana was not settled until late
in the next century by the Dutch. The British became the rulers in
1796 and established British Guiana in 1831. Independence was
granted in 1966. Guyana, which means ``Land of Many Waters,''
became a Republic in 1970 and was declared a cooperative republic
``in transition from capitalism to socialism'' by the 1980
constitution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Guyana is a tropical country on the northeast coast
of South America. Its 83,000-square-miles area is about the same as
Idaho. Guyana is inhabited mostly along the coast. The rest of the
country is tropical savanna and dense rain forest, rich in rivers,
ricelands, wildlife, gold, diamonds, silica sand and semi-precious
stones.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The majority of Guyana's population of 780,000 is
made up of English and Creolese-speaking people. They are highly
literate _ about 94 percent. Most of the people are descendants of
African slaves or indentured servants, mostly from India and a few
from Portugal, after slavery was abolished in 1833.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ Guyana has a modified parliamentary system,
with legislative power in a unicameral National Assembly. The
president, who is the leader of the majority party, is the chief

   POLITICS _ Politics are based more on ethnics than ideology,
with the ruling People's National Congress supported by urban
blacks and the People's Progressive Party of Cheddi Jagan backed by
Indo-Guyanese, most of them farmers. The National Congress, first
under the late President Forbes Burnham, and for the last two years
under President Desmond Hoyte, has governed Guyana since 1964.
Opposition parties, Western governments and human rights
organizations have accused the National Congress of maintaining
power by election manipulation. National elections were held in
1985. The next elections must be held no later than December 1990,
although President Hoyte could call them earlier.

   ECONOMY _ The government has launched a major drive for foreign
investment to spur the economy, which is nearly at a standstill and
dominated by a black market created by the country's nearly
depleted foreign exchange account. Economists estimate black market
transactions account for 80 percent of the country's economic life.
The country has a foreign debt exceeding $1.3 billion, 37 to 50
percent inflation, and 25 to 35 percent unemployment or
underemployment.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates thruout with closing prices.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices finished higher Tuesday as traders in
London were heartened by a relatively strong opening on Wall Street.
   The closely-watched Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index rose 6.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,854.8.
   Trading volume was 383.2 million shares, compared with Monday's
370.0 million shares.
   Market watchers had predicted earlier in the day that stock
prices in New York would fall in the wake of the U.S. Navy's
shooting down of an Iranian commercial jet on Sunday over the
Persian Gulf.
   But as U.S. stock trading resumed following the three-day
Independence Day weekend, prices opened only marginally lower and
strengthened as the session wore on.
   ``As soon as the market got wind that Wall Street wouldn't open
too far down, our market actually perked up,'' said one British
stock salesman.
   Analysts said the London market was also heartened by gains
sterling made after Monday's half-point rise to 10 percent in the
British commercial banks' base lending rate.
   ``Sterling's making a triumphant comeback,'' one trader said.
``This is the start of the rebound.''
   Another analyst said equities were freed to move higher since
the market has got the base rate increase ``out of its system.''
   However, stocks of companies with dollar earnings presented a
mixed picture at the end of the trading session, dealers said.

<HEAD>Sun Agrees to Buy Atlantic Petroleum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Co. Inc., a leading producer and
distributor of gasoline and petroleum products, said Tuesday it has
agreed to buy the smaller Atlantic Petroleum Corp. for $513 million.
   The acquisition is to be made, said Sun chairman Robert
McClements Jr., by purchasing all shares of Atlantic Petroleum
Maatschappij BV, a Netherlands holding company.
   The holding company is owned by John Duess, who bought the
Atlantic properties from Atlantic Richfield Co. in 1985 for $420
million.
   As part of the deal, Sun said it will pay for whatever
inventory, including crude oil and finished products, and working
capital is on hand at time of consummation.
   ``This acquisition is consistent with our objective of
strengthening the company's position in refining and marketing,''
said McClements.
   He said Sun currently owns four refineries with a processing
capacity of 460,000 barrels of crude oil daily and 6,000 Sunoco
stations in 27 states in the eastern half of the U.S.
   Atlantic has one refinery with 440 employees, in Philadelphia,
which handles 130,000 barrels of crude daily plus 571 company-owned
stations. Atlantic supplies another 400 independent stations, all
primarily in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.
   Also part of the purchase are 30 oil terminals owned by Atlantic
plus its 986-mile products pipeline system from its refinery to
Pittsburgh, Pa., and Rochester and Tonawanda, N.Y.
   All will continue to be operated under the Atlantic logo, said
Robert Campbell, president of Sun Refining and Marketing Co.
   ``The acquisition fits extremely well into Sun's existing
configuration and lends additional strength to our overall refining
and marketing efforts,'' Campbell said.
   Campbell said the Atlantic name will be retained because
Atlantic is ``well-managed and efficient'' and ``the combined Sun
and Atlantic operations will allow each organization to take
advantage of the other's strengths.''
   The acquisition is subject to antitrust review by the Federal
Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.
   Sun's refineries are located in Marcus Hook, Pa., a Philadelphia
suburb; Toleo, Ohio; Tulsa, Okla., and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.

   The stock market moved higher today in light
trading as bargain hunters took advantage of low, post-holiday
equities prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.29 at 2,146.87
at midafternoon.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 797 up, 565 down and
480 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 113.82 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   The market opened lower on some initial profit-taking in the
wake of higher interest rates in the credit markets, but the Dow
average moved into plus territory around midday.
   ``Bargain hunters came in, and we saw some buy programs that
bought the market up,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. He noted that a lack of institutional selling
helped the market rebound.
   Despite the turnaround, however, activity was somewhat dull. One
trader called it ``more apathetic than anything else _ the market
is trying to shrug off holiday cobwebs.''
   Traders anticipated light volume as some key decision makers
have extended their holiday weekend and since portfolio managers
have yet to pick their investments for the new quarter. ``Those
decisions aren't made in a day,'' a trader noted.
   With the stock market closed Monday for the Independence Day
holiday, this was the first opportunity traders had to react to the
weekend downing of an Iranian passenger plane by the U.S. Navy. But
analysts said the incident was largely overlooked.
   ``The market will take it as an international incident,'' said
Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   He noted that the oil and precious metals markets, which are
most sensitive to such global news, had no response, and therefore
``to attribute any weakness in the Dow to that (incident) would be
missing the point.''
   Traders speculated that there would have been more of a reaction
if the jetliner attack had occurred during the week.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, CSX Corp. was up 1{ at
28\; General Electric was up ] at 26~, and Exxon was up | at 45\.
   Mirroring activity in the previous session, a few utility stocks
were also heavily traded as investors used short-term trading
strategies to capture quarterly dividend payments. Delmar Power and
Light was unchanged at 18{; Montana Power was up [ at 34\, and
Pacific Telesis up ] at 29}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.13 to 154.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.17 at 309.17.

<HEAD>Koppers Managers, Partner Agree to Buy Koppers Chemicals Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that includes Koppers Co. managers
said Tuesday it had agreed to pay $660 million to take the
company's chemicals and related businesses private in a deal with
the winners of a bitter takeover battle.
   The managers, with financier Gordon Cain's Sterling Group as an
equity financing partner, expect to complete the deal by Aug. 5.
   The deal was negotiated with BNS Inc., a takeover group composed
of British industrialist Brian Beazer, the Wall Street investment
bank Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank.
   BNS completed a $1.8 billion tender offer for Koppers June 15.
   Cain will serve as chairman, and Glen Tenley, who was president
and chief operating officer of Koppers, will serve as president and
chief executive of the business, to be known as Koppers Chemical Co.
   The new company, with annual sales of about $600 million in
chemicals and wood products, will remain headquartered in
Pittsburgh.
   Beazer wanted Koppers for its building materials businesses,
which he added to his own international operations in the same
industry.
   He had intended to sell the chemicals and related businesses to
help finance the takeover, and he gave the Pittsburgh-based
managers exclusive right to negotiate for the units.
   The 6-year-old Sterling Group has completed 20 leveraged
buyouts, about one-third in the chemical industry. Tenley, 60, is a
33-year veteran of the chemicals business.
   The size of Cain's equity stake in the new company is ``among
the details to be worked out,'' said Koppers spokesman Robert
O'Gara.
   ``I'm not sure how much of that is going to be made public. This
is going to be a private corporation,'' he said.
   The other major unresolved issue is personnel, O'Gara said.
   The chemicals businesses employ about 4,000 people at 25 plants
around the country. All but 50 of the 1,150 employees at Koppers'
headquarters work for the chemicals businesses, and Beazer has yet
to pick the employees he wants to hire for the construction
materials operations, O'Gara said.
   The parties hope to resolve both issues in the next four weeks,
he said.
   ``Our cash flow is strong, and the outlook for the Koppers
chemical business is good,'' Tenley said in a statement.
   ``We are confident of our ability to grow to a $1 billion sales
organization by the early 1990s, and we will add that growth
through expansion of quality programs in our businesses and by
serving our customer base with new products and services,'' he said.
   Local government officials had pressed for Beazer to keep
Koppers in Pittsburgh, and Beazer said the buyout ``constitutes the
fulfillment of our pledge'' to give local management an edge in
negotiating for the businesses.

   Welbilt Corp., a major manufacturer of
food-service equipment, said Tuesday it agreed to be acquired by a
group led by management and the investment banking firm Kohlberg &
Co. in a deal valued at about $249.1 million.
   Under the agreement, the group would begin a tender offer next
Monday for all of the Welbilt's 9.4 million common shares
outstanding at $26.50 a share in cash. The acquisition is being
carried out by a subsidiary of CA Holdings Corp., a company
recently formed by the investment group.
   The deal is contingent upon, among other things, at least a
majority of the outstanding shares being tendered. It was approved
by Welbilt's board of directors and a special committee of outside
directors.
   Welbilt, based in New Hyde Park, provides food-service equipment
ranging from ice machines to deep-fat fryers to restaurants, hotels
and commercial bakeries.
   Kohlberg & Co. is a private merchant banking firm specializing
in leveraged buyouts, in which a company is acquired largely
through borrowed funds that are to be repaid from the target
company's profits or asset sales.

<HEAD>Rainy Forecast Pressures Soybean Futures; Corn Gains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures closed sharply lower Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as a rainy forecast diluted drought
fears, but corn prices advanced on speculation that the moisture
would come too late to prevent significant damage to that crop.
   Wheat and oats followed the soybean market, which saw some
contracts plummet the 30-cents-a-bushel limit for daily trading.
   After a brief opening rally across the board, soybean futures
plunged as the market digested Monday's 6-to-10 day National
Weather Service forecast predicting above-normal rainfall in key
growing areas for the five-day period beginning Sunday.
   The large speculative trading firms Refco Inc. and C&D
Commodities were big sellers of both soybeans and wheat, despite
disagreement among private and government forecasters about the
6-to-10 day outlook.
   But virtually all forecasters concurred on a hot, dry scenario
in the drought-stricken Farm Belt for the rest of this week and
that was enough to support corn prices.
   The corn crop is entering its critical pollination stage in the
eastern Corn Belt and ``if these private forecasters are right, its
going to be real, real bad for corn,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 8{ cents to 11{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.89 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 4 cents higher with July at $3.46 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 15 cents lower with July at $3.22 a bushel; soybeans were 12
cents to 30 cents lower with July at $9.61 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc., which recently was taken
private by the investment banking firm Kelso & Co., on Tuesday
announced it was selling its railway signaling business to an
Italian transportation company.
   The deal was expected to be completed later this summer pending
regulatory approval, although the terms were not disclosed.
   American Standard's railway signal division is a leading
manufacturer of signaling, control and communication equipment for
railroad and mass transit systems.
   The agreement with Genoa, Italy-based Ansaldo Group includes the
sale of Union Switch & Signal Co., which has plants in Batesburg,
S.C., and Augusta, Ga., and an engineering and research facility in
Pittsburgh; and an Italian subsidiary, which has plants near Turin
and Potenza. The group also has manufacturing facilities in Canada
and Ireland.
   Three other groups within American Standard's transportation
products segment, which operate under the names Wabco and Wabco
Westinghouse were not included in the sale.
   Tuesday's announcement came about a week after Kelso completed
its $2.5 billion acquisition of New York-based American Standard.
The merger was a friendly alternative to a hostile offer from Black
& Decker Corp., a Towson, Md.-based power tool manufacturer,
launched in late January.
   Kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts focusing on employee
stock ownership plans. In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired
largely through borrowed money that is to be repaid through the
target company's asset sales or profits.
   Besides railway systems, American Standard is one of the world's
largest producers of air conditioning and plumbing equipment.
   Ansaldo designs and manufactures mass transit systems, including
electric locomotives. The group is a subsidiary of Finmecanica SpA,
a diversified industrial company owned by the state-run Instituto
per la Reconstruzione Industrial.

   The dollar drifted lower in light trading
Tuesday as the British pound jumped in response to Monday's
increase in British interest rates.
   Gold prices were little changed. Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $438 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
from $437.25 an ounce late Friday.
   In the absence of notable economic news, currency traders were
reluctant to try pushing the dollar either sharply higher or
sharply lower.
   ``There was not a lot of conviction,'' said Phil Therkelsen, a
vice president and corporate trader at Bear, Stearns & Co.
   ``The market still likes the look of the dollar but are a little
afraid of the central banks,'' said John Lorry, a corporate trader

   The main beneficiary of the dollar's tight range was the pound,
as Britain's relatively high interest rates pulled in money,
dealers said.
   The Bank of England signaled a half-point increase in the
British commercial banks' base lending rate to 10 percent Monday,
but it took more than half a day for the rate hike to have any
impact on the currency, dealers said.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.7075 from $1.6825 late Monday.
Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.7076 from $1.6825 late
Friday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.55 Japanese yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in
London, it was 134.20 yen. At the end of the trading day in New
York, the dollar fell to 134.33 yen from 135.40 yen late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8204 West German marks, down from 1.8295; 1.5148
Swiss francs, down from 1.5233; 1.2129 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2215; 6.1415 French francs, down from 6.1595; and 1,351.50
Italian lire, down from 1,352.50.
   There was no U.S. trading in currencies or precious metals
Monday because of the Independence Day holiday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8235 West German marks, down from 1.8295; 1.5165
Swiss francs, down from 1.5233; 6.1430 French francs, down from
6.1595; 2.0600 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0575; 1,355.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,353.25; and 1.2134 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2215.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $440.41 a troy ounce
from $439.64 bid at Monday's close.
   Gold finished in London at a late bid price of $437.25 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Monday. In Zurich, gold was also unchanged at
a bid $437.50 an ounce.
   Later, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for
current delivery rose to $438.10 a troy ounce from $437.20 an ounce
late Friday.
   Silver prices rose on the London market, where the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.74 a troy ounce, compared with
$6.73 an ounce late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $6.766 a troy ounce from $6.703 an ounce
late Friday.

   Singer Co. said Tuesday it has agreed to
sell its motor products division to Ryobi Limited of Japan for
about $325 million.
   The division, located in Pickens and Anderson, S.C., is a major
source of power tools for Sears, Roebuck & Co. It also produces
floor-care equipment.
   Ryobi is a diversified manufacturer based in Tokyo with
consolidated annual sales of $1 billion.
   Ryobi and Singer said in a joint announcement of their
definitive agreement that they expect to complete the transaction
by mid-August.
   Hiroshi Urakami, president of Ryobi and Paul Bilzerian, chairman
and chief executive of Singer, said the agreement ``represents a
positive development for both parties.
   ``The motor products division's position as a leader in the U.S.
power tool industry adds a significant new business strength to
Ryobi. At the same time, Ryobi understands the industry and is
deeply committed to further enhancing the motor products division's
reputation for product quality and innovation.''
   Singer's motor products division employs about 2,600 people in
South Carolina. Their employment was not expected to be affected by
the agreement, said Tom Elliott, a Singer spokesman in Stamford.
   Singer, a Stamford-based aerospace and consumer manufacturing
company, has annual sales of $1.9 billion.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Prices Plummet On Rainy Forecast; Corn Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade as a rainy forecast diluted drought fears, but corn prices
advanced on speculation that the moisture would come too late to
prevent heavy damage to the corn crop.
   Wheat and oats futures prices followed the soybean market, which
saw some contracts plummet the 30-cents-a-bushel limit for daily
trading.
   On other markets, cattle futures were mostly higher while pork
futures were mostly lower; energy and precious-metals futures
gained; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Trading was heavy and ``extraordinarily volatile'' in the grain
and soybean markets as players digested Monday's 6-to-10 day
National Weather Service forecast predicting above-normal rainfall
in key growing areas next week, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   After a brief opening rally across the board, soybean futures
plunged and the grains generally followed.
   Analysts said a return to normal precipitation patterns even
this late in the growing season would save most of the soybean
crop. Indications that a growing number of farmers in the Southeast
and southern Great Plains plan to plant soybeans on land cleared by
the winter wheat harvest also weighed on soybean prices, said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst for G.H. Miller & Co. in Chicago.
   The large speculative trading firms Refco Inc. and C&D
Commodities were massive sellers of both soybeans and wheat,
despite disagreement among private and government forecasters about
the 6-to-10 day outlook, analysts said.
   But virtually all forecasters concurred on a hot, dry scenario
in the drought-stricken Farm Belt for the rest of this week and
that was enough to support corn futures prices as the crop entered
its critical pollination phase.
   ``This week we're staring down the barrel of pollination in the
eastern Corn Belt areas,'' Gidel said. ``The corn crop could
sustain significant damage this week if the current weather
patterns persist. And even if the rain comes next week it's not
going to help the cause very much.''
   Added Lespinasse: ``If these private forecasters are right, its
going to be real, real bad for corn.''
   Wheat settled 8{ cents to 11{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.89 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4\ cents
higher with July at $3.44 a bushel; oats were unchanged to the
limit 15 cents lower with July at $3.22 a bushel; and soybeans were
12 cents to 30 cents lower with July at $9.59 a bushel.
   The drop in grain prices, combined with a demand-driven rise in
cash cattle prices, gave most cattle futures a healthy boost on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   But hog futures finished mixed and frozen pork bellies plummeted
their 2-cents-a-pound limit for the second consecutive session in a
continued bearish reaction to Thursday's monthly hogs-and-pigs
report from the Agriculture Deparment, analysts said.
   ``The report showed a lot more hogs than expected and there were
ideas we'll have to liquidate those hogs now because of the high
corn prices,'' said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research
Inc. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to 1.10 cents higher with
August at 65.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .78 cent to 1.45
cents higher with August at 75.12 cents a pound; hogs were .97 cent
lower to .58 cent higher with July at 44.07 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.90 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 33.25
cents a pound.
   Oil futures rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange but the
market registered little reaction to the downing of an Iranian
passenger jetliner by a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian Gulf,
analysts said.
   Instead, the rise in prices was primarily a technical correction
after last week's sharp declines, said Peter Cardillo, commodities
trading adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 16 cents
higher with August at $15.09 a barrel; heating oil was .54 cent to
.60 cent higher with August at 41.59 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .85 cent to 1.37 cents higher with August at 49.72
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals basically followed the oil markets higher in
rather dull trading, said Richard Levine, vice president of the
precious metals and foreign exchange group for Elders Futures Inc.
in New York.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 70 cents to $1.20
higher with August at $440.30 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to
6.6 cents higher with July at $6.766 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures posted strong gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of
the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 5.75 points higher at
278.65.

   Dennis B. Levine, the former investment banker
whose squealings led to Wall Street's biggest insider trading
scandal, was freed from prison Tuesday and transferred to a
work-furlough program.
   Kenneth Treon, a counselor at the Lewisburg federal prison camp
in Lewisburg, Pa., where Levine had been confined since April 1987,
said by telephone that a relative of Levine's picked him up Tuesday
morning for the drive to New York, about 150 miles to the east.
   ``He had a clear conduct record,'' Treon said. ``He had no
violations of institution rules or records. He did what he was
told.''
   Treon said Levine, who is in the midst of a two-year prison
term, was released under a halfway-house program for inmates within
six months of their parole date. He said the program ``enables a
man to enter back into society by assisting them with possible job
opportunities.''
   Unescorted by guards, Levine left to go to a halfway house for
federal inmates in the New York area, said Kathryn Morse, a Bureau
of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington. She declined to identify the
facility until Wednesday after Levine had reported there, in
accordance with federal rules.
   Levine's attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, also declined to identify
the facility except to say it was in New York. He also declined to
speculate on what type of work Levine hoped to do.
   Formerly a mergers specialist at the investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., Levine was arrested in May 1986 after the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of making $12.6
million in profits through illegal trading on inside information.
   Levine was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of
securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He is eligible for
parole beginning this September.
   Whatever work Levine does, it will not be related to Wall
Street. Under an SEC order against him, spokesman Chiles Larson
said, Levine ``is barred from any participation in any form of the
securities business, in any capacity.''
   It was Levine's cooperation with federal authorities that led
them to Wall Street speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who used sensitive
information provided by Levine to profit on insider trading himself.
   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million in illicit insider
trading profits and penalties in November 1986. He is now serving a
three-year federal prison term for conspiracy to lie to the SEC.
   Both men provided extensive information to prosecutors and
implicated other securities professionals in a widespread insider
trading scandal that jolted Wall Street and raised a clamor about
ethics in the financial world.
   Last month, Boesky was temporarily transferred from a prison
camp in Lompoc, Calif., to a New York correctional facility. John
Veltri, Lompoc's assistant superintendent, said Boesky had been
returned to Lompoc last Friday.
   Boesky's presence in New York raised speculation he was
testifying before a federal grand jury about John Mulheren, a stock
trader arrested in February on charges he intended to kill Boesky
for implicating him in the scandal.
   Under federal speedy-trial rules, Mulheren had a right to an
indictment by Tuesday, unless he granted prosecutor requests for
more time. Thomas Puccio, Mulheren's attorney, said he agreed on
Tuesday to a three-week extension.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices declined in quiet activity Tuesday,
as traders returned from the three-day holiday weekend without any
strong conviction about the market's direction.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond lost about { point,
or $5 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate
trends, rose to 8.87 percent from 8.83 percent late Friday.
   The financial markets were closed on Monday in observance of
Independence Day.
   Analysts said many investors remained on the sidelines in
anticipation of Friday's unemployment report for June.
   ``There's no reason to do anything,'' said Maria Ramirez, a
managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``The market's
losing a sense of direction; people don't know what to focus on.''
   A weaker dollar on world currency markets and a recent
purchasing managers' report showing continued economic growth
brought a negative tone to the market, analysts said. But,
``nothing really jumps out at you,'' said Mitchell Held, chief
economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Signs of a strong economy are considered bearish for
bondholders, who worry about increased inflation and rising
interest rates.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues declined by between 1-16 point and 7-32 point,
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a business
information service. Intermediate maturities fell by between 7-32
point and ] point and 20-year issues dropped 7-16 point.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, stood at 1,152.11, down 2.54. The Merrill
Lynch Treasury bond index, which makes a similar measurement, fell
0.15 to 110.13.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, edged down 0.07 to 285.88.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, slipped 2 basis
points to 6.53 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills edged up 1 basis point to 6.69
percent and one-year bills rose 3 basis points to 7.02 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7} percent, down from 7~
percent late Friday.

   The stock market climbed Tuesday to its highest
levels since the October crash in moderate, post-holiday trading
driven by futures-related buying.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 27.03 points to
finish at 2,158.61, its highest post-crash level since it closed at
2,152.20 on June 22.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
939 issues up, 520 down and 447 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 171.79 million shares,
down from 238.33 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
198.91 million shares.
   A weaker dollar, lower bond prices and the U.S. Navy's downing
of an Iranian passenger jet over the weekend had convinced many
traders that the stage was set for a selloff.
   ``A man of common sense would say we were due for continued
profit-taking,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First
Albany Corp.
   But while the market did open moderately lower, the Dow average
moved into plus territory around midday and steadily climbed for
the rest of the session.
   ``The main impetus behind the lift in the Dow was buy programs
by arbitrageurs,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of technical
market analysis at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   He was referring to a strategy which utilizes computers to
automatically buy stocks in New York and sell equivalent
stock-index futures in Chicago to profit from price discrepancies.
   The Dow average also got a solid boost from a sharply higher oil
sector. Chevron was up 2 at 47\, Exxon was up 1\ at 45~, and Texaco
was up { at 47[. Each is a component of the key index.
   Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp.,
said stocks are ``continuing to gather a following because people
are realizing they're not going down when bonds are off _
(investors) have to jump aboard despite the action in the bond
market.''
   Money managers, who are realigning their portfolios as the third
quarter gets underway, are keying in on equities.
   ``There are lots of institutions that underperformed in the
second quarter because they didn't own stocks, and they came into
this quarter under a little pressure'' to own equities, Johnson
said.
   With the stock market closed Monday for the Independence Day
holiday, this session marked the first opportunity traders had to
react to the Navy's attack on an Iranian passenger plane. But
analysts said the incident was largely overlooked.
   ``It appears that the market is suggesting that this event, as
tragic as it is, will pass,'' Johnson said. Fundamentally, analysts
say, oil prices remain on the decline.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up 2| at 129\,
General Electric was up | at 44{, and AT&T was up { at 27.
   Mirroring activity in the previous session, a few utility stocks
were also heavily traded as investors used short-term trading
strategies to capture quarterly dividend payments. Delmar Power and
Light led the actives list, closing down \ at 18\; Carolina Power
and Light was off [ at 33], and Pacific Telesis up { at 29~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $31.081 billion, or 1.14
percent, in value.
   The NYSE index was up 1.89 at 155.57.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 4.77 to 318.52,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index closed at 275.81, up 4.03.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed up
0.59 at 309.59. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 396.11, up 1.42.

   Medserv Corp., a diversified health
services company, said Tuesday it has reached separate agreements
to help set up a neonatal clinic in Moscow and a dental laboratory
in the Ukraine.
   The company said it expects to sign contracts for the two
ventures in September, and estimated they will be worth a total of
about $150 million.
   Under a $140 million agreement with All Union Scientific
Research Center in Moscow, Medserv will design, construct, equip
and train technical staff for a new 160-unit neonatal facility. The
facility, which will be part of the Institute for Mother and Child,
will treat children under age 1.
   Medserv also signed a letter of intent with Licensintorg and the
Central Dental Scientific Institute to provide equipment, raw
materials, training and technology for production of filling
composite materials at a dental manufacturing facility in the
Ukraine. That contract will be worth about $10 million, Medserv
said.
   Medserv has three operating subsidiaries: Primedica, which
manages hospital-based cardiopulmonary and respiratory therapy
units, manages neonatal care units and provides medical equipment
and homecare services; the Dental Services Group, a network of
dental laboratories; and Medvet, which is in the field of
veterinary pathology.

   Officials of the Farm Credit System announced
Tuesday a merger that will combine nine of the system's banks for
cooperatives into one lending institution.
   ``This vote is a landmark in agricultural finance,'' said Edward
Breihan of Lubbock, Texas, chairman of a committee on banks for
cooperatives structure.
   The merger decision was announced in Denver and Washington by
the Farm Credit Council, an arm of the Farm Credit System, a $50
billion network of borrower-owned cooperatives that taken together
represent the nation's largest farm lender.
   The Farm Credit System, which was established in 1933, has been
rocked by financial problems in recent years. The 13 banks for
cooperatives _ 12 based on regional districts and one central bank
located in Denver _ are one component of the system.
   They offer a complete line of financing and related services to
agricultural cooperatives, rural utility systems and other
borrowers. They reported $11 billion in assets in 1987 and $8
billion in loan volume.
   Under bailout legislation approved by Congress last December,
banks for cooperatives in eight districts voted to merger with the
central bank in Denver and those in four other districts opposed
the plan.
   District banks for cooperatives voting to merge were Baltimore,
Columbia, S.C.; Louisville, Ky.; St. Louis, Omaha, Wichita, the
Texas Bank for Cooperatives, and Sacramento. Those opposed were
Springfield, Mass.; Jackson, Miss.; St. Paul, Minn.; and Spokane,
Wash.
   The stockholder vote was June 30.
   The merger blueprint was developed by the committee headed by
Breihan.
   District banks for cooperatives that did not approve the merger
will continue to operate independently but may choose to join the
newly formed bank later or to take part in other mergers,
authorities said.
   They said the new bank will begin operations Jan. 1. It will
have authority to make loans anywhere in the country and a lending
office in each of the banks taking part in the merger. The Central
Bank for Cooperatives will be part of the new institution.
   District banks of cooperatives that did not vote to merge also
will have authority to make loans anywhere in the country.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Plans To Begin Mining Gold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.
said Tuesday it would spend about $75 million to start a gold mine
near Winnemucca, Nev., and hopes to recover an estimated 800,000
ounces of the precious metal.
   Santa Fe Pacific Mining Inc. plans to begin mining its Rabbit
Creek deposit, covering 56 square miles, in the second half of
1990. When the mine reaches full production in 1991, Santa Fe said
it is expected to mine about 100,000 ounces of gold each year.
   Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said that even though the company has drilled
270 test holes on only a small part of the property, it believes
the mine could contain approximately 3.6 million ounces of gold.
   The first phase of the project involves further drilling,
metallurgical testing and engineering to prepare for the mine and
mill construction, the company said. That work should be done by
the end of the year, it said.
   Santa Fe said it would cost an estimated $75 million to fully
develop the open pit mine, the carbon-in-leach mill and other
facilities needed to process the oxide reserves.
   The company said in a statement that it would take ``substantial
additional investment'' to build the facilities needed to process
the sulfide reserves also at the site.

Coca-Cola Co. over labeling and advertising claims for its
``premium choice'' pasteurized Minute Maid orange juice.
   Tropicana contends the description on the side panel of the
Minute Maid container and ads depicting the juice as ``100 percent
pure Florida orange juice straight from the orange'' are false and
deceptive under an appellate ruling in a 6-year-old case.
   In the 1982 case against Tropicana, Coca Cola established that
no processor could claim pasteurized orange juice was juice ``as it
comes from the orange,'' according to Martin Gutfreund, a Tropicana
vice president.

   A congressional study has concluded the Reagan
administration should abandon its controversial proposal to trade
away potentially valuable oil rights in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.
   The Interior Department wants to trade the mineral rights to
166,000 acres in the refuge for surface rights to 896,000 acres
owned by six Alaska native corporations.
   The GAO said Tuesday that Interior has valued the acreage at six
times its appraised market value, while Interior is rating the deal
as an even-up trade worth $539 million to both sides and one that
offers the nation its best hope of lessening increasing dependence
on imported oil.

<HEAD>CNW Threatens To Cut 1,200 Brakeman Jobs If No Concessions Made</HEAD>

   CNW Corp. threatened Tuesday to eliminate 1,200
railroad jobs and risk a strike affecting 40,000 Chicago-area
commuters unless it gets substantial union contract concessions
beyond those proposed by a presidential board aiming to avert a
strike.
   But the leader of the United Transportation Union called the
announcement a ploy and said the union had no plans to meet with
the company to discuss the job cuts, which would take effect Aug. 4.
   A three-member emergency board, appointed by order of President
Reagan under the Railway Labor Act to head off a threatened strike,
has recommended a non-binding compromise that would allow CNW's
railroad subsidiary, the Chicago & North Western Transportation
Co., to eliminate nearly 700 jobs.
   Further job reductions would be decided on a case-by-case basis,
under the recommendation made Friday.
   But Chicago-based CNW expressed disappointment Tuesday in the
panel's suggestion, saying it ``does not go far enough toward
solving the problem of archaic work rules that require the North
Western to retain obselete, unproductive brakeman jobs.
   ``If the recommendation were accepted, the North Western would
still be required to retain approximately 500 brakeman jobs which
no longer have any function and would spend approximately $25
million each year for unproductive labor costs,'' the company said
in a statement.
   CNW's plan to eliminate virtually all the brakeman jobs on its
freight trains _ cutting the crew size from four to two workers in
most cases _ would save the company $53 million a year, said
spokesman Fred Bloedorn.
   Bloedorn said technological advances of the past 100 years have
eliminated many of the brakeman's traditional duties.
   But the union contends elimination of the jobs would violate its
contract and insists that no cuts be made.
   Although the proposed job reductions apply only to CNW's freight
lines, both the union and railroad said a strike would halt
commuter service.
   CNW said it expected to meet with the union within the next few
days under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. But unless
the UTU offers concessions ``substantially beyond the emergency
board's recommendation,'' the company said it would implement its
job-reduction plan on Aug. 4, immediately after the end of a 30-day
cooling-off period.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, that's just a ploy by the carrier,''
UTU General Chairman Don Markgraf said in a telephone interview
from his office in Wauwatosa, Wis.
   He called the presidential panel's recommendation ``a
disgrace,'' and said CNW ``got everything imaginable from the
emergency board.''
   When asked whether the union planned to meet with the company,
Markgraf replied: ``Nobody's contacted me.''
   President Reagan appointed the emergency panel on April 20,
after the National Mediation Board said a union walkout could
deprive several Midwestern states of essential transportation
service.
   CNW is the eighth-largest U.S. railroad, based on revenue, and
handled nearly 1.5 million carloads of traffic in 1986. It also
provides the primary daily rail service for about 40,000
Chicago-area commuters.

   Tropicana Products Inc. has sued the
Coca-Cola Co. over labeling and advertising claims for its
``premium choice'' pasteurized Minute Maid orange juice.
   Tropicana contends the description on the side panel of the
Minute Maid container and ads depicting the juice as ``100 percent
pure Florida orange juice straight from the orange'' are false and
deceptive under an appellate ruling in a 6-year-old case.
   A Coca-Cola spokeswoman responded that the 1982 case involving a
Tropicana television commercial and the new suit are not comparable.
   Tropicana filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court in New
York, said Martin Gutfreund, a Tropicana vice president.
   Tropicana maintains its competitor violates the federal appeals
court decision governing advertising of pasteurized orange juice.
   ``Minute Maid seems to us to have willfully disregarded the very
rule of law that was established in their own lawsuit,'' Gutfreund
said Tuesday.
   Coca-Cola established in a 1982 case against Tropicana that no
processor could claim pasteurized orange juice was juice ``as it
comes from the orange,'' Gutfreund said.
   Coca-Cola has been served with a copy of the suit, and a
show-cause hearing has been set Monday, said Michelle Beale,
Coca-Cola Foods vice president of public affairs in Houston.
   ``We think Tropicana is making a mountain out of a molehill,''
she said Tuesday night in a telephone interview. ``Basically we
think the 1982 lawsuit was materially different. That was a
challenge to an entire commercial. What they have done now is pick
out a phrase on a package.''

<HEAD>Individuals To Be Allowed To Buy Real Estate Overseas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea would allow individuals to
buy up to $1 million worth of overseas real estate under a
government draft plan that drastically would ease current
restrictions on such purchases, officials said Wednesday.
   Officials at the Finance Ministry said that under the draft
measures, the purchases would be subject to the Bank of Korea's
approval and would apply to houses, land and other real estate.
   The ministry officials said the measures were expected to go
into effect later this month following revisions to foreign
exchange control regulations.
   They said the new measures were intended to spur investment
abroad and trim the country's sizable current account surplus in a
bid to avoid friction with the United States and other countries
which run trade deficits with South Korea.
   South Korea's current account surplus reached $9.8 billion last
year and is projected to hit the $10 billion mark this year unless
steps are taken to hold it down.
   They said business corporations would be exempt from any
government control in purchasing up to $1 million in real estate
overseas but would need the central bank's approval for purchase of
more than $1 million.
   However, both individual and corporate investors would be banned
from buying luxurious villas in famous world resort areas, the
ministry officials said.
   Under the new measures, the scope of corporate purchase, now
limited to business-related property such as offices, warehouses,
parking lots and exhibit halls, would be expanded to include
houses, welfare facilities, forest land and other real estate, the
officials said.
   South Korea's overall direct investment overseas aggregated to
$1.03 billion at the end of 1987.
