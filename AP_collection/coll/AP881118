<HEAD>President Calls New Drug Law a `Sword and Shield' For Nation</HEAD>

   President Reagan says his signing of a complex
anti-drug abuse bill gives the nation ``a new sword and shield'' in
the battle against illegal substances.
   Joined by hundreds of citizens, police officers and congressional
supporters of the measure, Reagan on Friday turned the East Room
bill signing ceremony into a tribute to his wife, Nancy.
   The first lady has made the ``Just Say No,'' anti-drug campaign
among youngsters a major activity during her years in the White
House.
   ``And now in the eleventh hour of this presidency, we give a new
sword and shield to those whose daily business it is to eliminate
from America's streets and towns the scourge of illicit drugs,''
Reagan said.
   The president praised the measure's toughened approach to any and
all drug abusers, from ``recreational'' users to drug kingpins.
   Reagan praised his wife for her eight-year battle ``to not only
rid our society of drugs, but to banish any lingering tolerance of
the notion that drugs are cool or hip.''
   ``The nation now acknowledges what Nancy has been saying for the
past several years, that drugs give a false high,'' he said.
   After giving his wife a big hug and kiss on the mouth, the
president presented Mrs. Reagan with the pen he used to sign the
four-inch thick bill.
   The new law aims to attack the use of illegal drugs through
stricter law enforcement, tougher penalties, and increased
treatment, rehabilitation and education.
   And in a separate area, it toughens child pornography laws and
creates a new federal offense for those ``engaged in the business''
of distributing obscene materials.
   The measure provides about $500 million for spending in the
nation's battle against drugs, even though the bill's authors had
estimated it would cost $1.4 billion in the first year alone to
finance all provisions of the legislation.
   The bill calls for the new president to name a Cabinet-level
``drug czar,'' a position that pays $99,500 a year and must be
confirmed by the Senate.
   The czar, officially known as the National Drug Policy Director,
must outline an overall plan for enforcement and treatment programs,
known as the National Drug Control Strategy.
   The law grants the new official virtually unprecedented powers,
particularly in the right to intervene in the budget-making process
of government agencies.
   The 30 or so agencies involved in anti-drug programs will be
required to submit their proposed drug budgets to the czar, who will
have the power to revise them if they do not comply with the
strategy document.
   The bipartisan measure was approved on a 346-11 vote in the House
and passed by voice vote in the Senate in the waning days of the
congressional session last month.
   The bill contains stiff penalties for drug traffickers and users.
Serious drug offenses would carry stiffer minimum prison terms.
   The measure also makes it possible for those possessing small
quantities of drugs intended for personal use to be hit with up to
$10,000 in civil fines, although they would have the right to court
review.
   Beginning next September, those convicted of drug offenses could
face loss of student loans and other federal benefits, including
public housing, grants, contracts, loans, mortgage guarantees and
some forms of veterans aid. It would not include Social Security,
Medicare, welfare benefits, veterans' disability and other safety
net programs.
   Drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while
committing drug-related felonies could themselves be executed under
a new revitalized federal death penalty. However, the
constitutionality of that provision is in doubt and it is certain to
face court challenges should federal officials attempt to use it.
   The new law also makes it a federal felony to dispense anabolic
steroids without a prescription, and establishes a maximum penalty
of up to three years in prison, plus fines.
   Since it will be up to President-elect George Bush to name the
new czar, speculation has centered on a number of possible nominees,
including Associate Attorney General Francis B. Keating, Customs
Commissioner William Von Raab and Drug Enforcement Administration
Chief Jack Lawn, among others.
   Reagan also signed legislation Friday to:
   _End the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean by 1992 by closing
the nation's last remaining sludge dumping site, about 106 miles off
the New Jersey coast.
   _Provide a 4.1 percent cost-of-living increase in the
compensation paid to the nearly 2.2 million military veterans with
service-connected disabilities. The same percentage increase, which
will become effective Dec. 1, will also be provided the
approximately 323,000 surviving spouses and dependents of veterans
whose deaths were service-connected.

<HEAD>Judge Calls Fish and Wildlife Service's Spotted Owl Decision
Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday said the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's decision not to designate the northern spotted
owl as an endangered species was illegal.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas S. Zilly issued a written decision
calling the service's action arbitrary and capricious, expanding
upon his ruling on Nov. 9, according to a news release issued by the
Sierra Club Legal Defense Club.
   Zilly ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to review its
decision and explain it within 90 days.
   The ruling was a victory for environmentalists. The spotted owl
is considered an indicator species, meaning it represents other
creatures that depend upon the same ecosystem. The northern spotted
owl lives in the remnants of the Pacific Northwest's ancient
old-growth forests.
   Zilly found the Fish and Wildlife Service had no expert analysis
backing its conclusion that the owl is not endangered.
   ``Rather, the expert opinion is entirely to the contrary,'' he
wrote.
   ``The service disregarded all the expert opinion on population
viability, including that of its own expert, that the owl is facing
extinction. ... The service has failed to provide its own or other
expert analysis supporting its conclusions,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Portland, Ore.,
office could not be reached for comment.
   Zilly also said the agency mischaracterized the conclusions of
Mark Boyce, a timber industry consultant, when it concluded Boyce
did not believe the spotted owl faced extinction.
   Zilly noted Boyce wrote to the agency and said he did not
conclude the owl has a low probability of extinction, and that he
would be ``very disappointed'' if efforts to preserve the owl were
thwarted by a misrepresentation of his work.
   More than 25 environmental groups filed the case after the Fish
and Wildlife Service decided last December not to list the owl as
endangered or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act.
   Spotted owls have been on Washington state's endangered list
since January. About 600 pairs of the owls remain in the state, the
state Wildlife Department estimates.

   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and several
state agencies are investigating possible consumer fraud in
connection with a nationwide cancer charity sweepstakes organized by
a direct-mail company, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions that the Watson
and Hughey Co. of Alexandria, Va., has sent letters to about 48
million households throughout the country soliciting participation
in a fund-raising campaign on behalf of three cancer research
organizations.
   The letters state that the recipient has ``won a cash prize in
the $5,000 Sweepstakes'' and ask for a voluntary contribution of $5,
but closer reading reveals that the total value of the contest is
$5,000, with a maximum individual award of $100 and a minimum of 10
cents, the newspaper said.
   The letters were signed by Washington attorney Robert R. Stone
and sent on behalf of the Pacific West Cancer Fund of Seattle, the
Knoxville, Tenn.-based Cancer Fund of America and the Walker Cancer
Research Institute of Edgewood, Md.
   The Post said the mailings have prompted calls to consumer and
legal agencies from people believing they had won $5,000, two
lawsuits alleging consumer fraud in Missouri and Illinois,
suspension of charity registration in Maryland for two of the cancer
research organizations, consumer warnings in other states and
investigations in Virginia and by the federal government.

   Former Rep. Mario Biaggi faced up to 146 years in
prison and $7 million in fines at sentencing Friday for a
racketeering conviction in the Wedtech corruption scandal.
   The New York City Democrat was convicted Aug. 5 on federal
racketeering, conspiracy, extortion and mail fraud charges for
turning Wedtech Corp., now a defunct defense contractor, into a
racketeering enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes to
public officials.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley was scheduled to
sentence Biaggi, 70, and four other defendants.
   Also convicted of racketeering in the four-month trial in federal
court in Manhattan were former Bronx Borough President Stanley
Simon, 58; Wedtech founder John Mariotta, 58; former Small Business
Administration official Peter Neglia, 40, and Biaggi's former law
partner, Bernard Ehrlich, 59.
   Biaggi's eldest son, Richard, 39, was acquitted of racketeering
charges but was found guilty of bribe receiving, mail fraud and tax
charges.
   All except Ehrlich, who was to be sentenced at a later date, were
to appear before Motley Friday.
   A seventh defendant, Ronald Betso, 40, was acquitted on all
counts.
   Biaggi, a 10-term congressman who had been a highly decorated
city police officer from 1942 to 1965, was convicted of all but one
of the 16 counts against him. He resigned his House seat the day
after his conviction.
   Biaggi was found guilty of extorting $50,000 in cash and stock
once worth more than $3 million from Wedtech in exchange for his
political clout. He also was convicted of filing false financial
disclosure statements and bogus income tax returns to cover up his
illegal profits.
   He did not testify in his defense after the judge gave
prosecutors wide latitude to cross examine him about such things as
his 1987 conviction for obstructing justice and taking an illegal
gratuity. He received a 30-month sentence in that case.

   Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun was ready to
concede the governor's race after picking up only 61 votes on
Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete during a recount ended Thursday,
Sundlun's campaign manager said.
   Sundlun is to make the concession speech Monday, almost two weeks
after the Nov. 8 general election, said campaign manager Kenneth
Haupt.
   ``I don't think there will be a bitter tone to it. He was pleased
with the tone of the campaign and the showing he made,'' Haupt said.
``I think he's going to make it clear that Bruce Sundlun is not
disappearing, because he's not.''
   Sundlun, a millionaire communications executive, was in
Washington on business and unavailable to comment before then, Haupt
said.
   The unofficial tally before the recount was 202,962 for DiPrete
and 196,188 for Sundlun, giving DiPrete a lead of 6,774 votes.
   Frank Williams, vice chairman of the state Elections Board, said
it would be about 10 days before the final tallies would be
certified.
   ``We're pretty well completed. We just have to recalculate the
changes on the tabulation sheets,'' he said.
   Of 1,806 machines, only about 10 had any changes discovered
during the recount, he said. ``That's par for the course,'' Williams
said.
   The recount, which was expected to take three days, began
Wednesday and went more quickly than expected, he said. Officials
from both DiPrete's and Sundlun's campaigns hovered around elections
officials as they opened the back of each machine and read the
meters.
   ``I knew at about 11 o'clock on election night that it was
over,'' Haupt said. ``But I saw that Bruce wanted to know for
absolutely sure that he lost, so that's why I asked for a recount.''
   Sundlun lost to DiPrete by a 2-to-1 margin in 1986 but this year
Sundlun parlayed repeated questions about DiPrete's ethics into the
close race.
   Haupt said the Sundlun campaign office would be closed next
Tuesday.
   DiPrete's spokeswoman could not be reached for comment.

   A woman who tipped police on the
whereabouts of a newborn abducted from a hospital by a woman posing
as a nurse will receive a $27,500 reward, police said Thursday.
   The woman, who requested anonymity, called the Police
Department's hot line Monday and directed police to the Hot Springs
home of Acqunetta Rushon Smith, where the missing baby, Christopher
Michael Jones, was found. The 6-week-old premature infant was taken
from Doctors Hospital on Nov. 1, three days after he had been born
to Annette Thomas-Jones.
   ``The concerned caller that gave us the tip that allowed us to
recover the baby is very deserving of the reward and we'll see that
she gets that reward,'' said Little Rock Police Chief Louis Caudell.
   The reward consisted of $10,000 contributed by Doctors Hospital;
$10,000 from ``USA Today: The Television Show;'' $2,500 from
Arkansas Easter Seals; $1,000 from St. John's Baptist Church, the
parish of the baby's parents; $1,000 from Little Rock Children's
Clinic; $1,000 from Protecting Arkansas Children Together; $1,000
from the Little Rock Police Crimestoppers Program; and two $500
contributions from anonymous donors.
   Ms. Smith, 32, was arrested Monday. She pleaded innocent and
innocent by reason of insanity Wednesday in Pulaski County Circuit
Court pleaded innocent and innocent by reason of mental disease or
defect to a charge of permanent detention or restraint.
   Caudell wouldn't comment on the case because of a gag order
imposed by Circuit Judge Floyd Lofton.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is looking for ways to halt the
spread of destructive honey bee mites.
   Although not known to be harmful to other creatures, the mites _
Varroa Jacobsoni _ were first discovered in the United States in
September 1987 in a Wisconsin apiary and since have spread to 17
other states.
   Beekeeping is credited by USDA with the pollination of many
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around $20
billion. Those include many fruits, vegetables and hay crops.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the Agriculture Department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Thursday a
15-member department advisory committee will draft regulations to
prevent further spread of the destructive mites.
   The panel will include representatives of state departments of
agriculture, beekeeping organizations and related groups. The
committee's first meeting will be held in Washington Nov. 30 through
Dec. 2, Glosser said.
   The USDA agency imposed a federal quarantine last April to
restrict movement of bees and bee equipment from infested states but
canceled it a month later ``when the regulations proved too complex
to administer successfully.''
   Glosser said the committee will employ ``negotiated rulemaking''
to form federal regulations acceptable to the various parts of the
bee industry.
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood. Department experts have described the
female as about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, with the male
somewhat smaller.
   Infestations can cause decreased brood numbers, deformed bees and
weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce
honey. The mites can infest a colony so gradually that it may be
unnoticed until serious damage has occurred.
   Besides Wisconsin, states where the mites have been found are:
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington.
   Glosser said the public can submit written statements at the
meeting or they can be sent before the meeting to: Helene Wright,
APHIS, USDA, Room 1143-S, P.O. Box 96464, Washington, D.C.

   The skimpy U.S. soybean harvest this year not
only has helped boost prices for American farmers but it has helped
trigger rapid expansion among foreign oilseed competitors, says the
Agriculture Department.
   Drought left soybean output at a 12-year low of 1.5 billion
bushels, down 21 percent from the 1987 harvest, with Corn Belt
producers suffering the brunt of the yield losses.
   The USDA says soybean prices could average $6.75 to $8.75 per
bushel in the marketing year that began on Sept. 1, compared with
$6.15 last season and $4.78 in 1986-87.
   Meanwhile, the department's Economic Research Service is also
keeping an eye on oilseed developments overseas, particularly in
Argentina and Brazil, where planting for next year's harvest began
in September and will continue through next month.
   ``Total Argentine oilseed area is expected to jump 16 percent to
just under 9 million hectares, of which 7.7 million hectares are
soybean and sunflower seed,'' the agency said in a recent outlook
report.
   For the first time, the report added, Argentina's planted area of
oilseeds is expected to exceed its grain area. A hectare _ the
metric unit _ is equal to about 2.47 acres.
   In Brazil, soybean plantings are forecast to expand more than 9
percent to 11.5 million hectares.
   The expansion in South America, which could be even greater if
world soybean prices edge higher, comes on the heels of record
soybean harvests this year in both Argentina and Brazil.
   As a result of the larger yield of soybeans and a reduced amount
used for crushing, or processing, into oil and meal, both countries
have ample supplies available for export in 1988-89, the report said.
   Together, Argentina and Brazil could export around 7 million
metric tons of soybeans and 15 million tons of soybean meal in the
coming year, up 48 percent and 32 percent, respectively, from
1987-88.
   One metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of soybeans.
   The United States remains far in front as the world's leading
producer of soybeans, but the reduced 1988 harvest and short
supplies have given other producers a big step up into the global
market.
   A recent USDA supply-and-demand analysis showed that the world
output of soybeans in 1988-89 is expected to be about 94 million
tons, down from nearly 102.9 million tons last year.
   The United States' drought-shrunken harvest will provide more
than 41 million tons of this season's world total, or about 40
percent. In 1987-88, the U.S. share was about 52.3 million tons or
about 51 percent of the year's total output.
   With reduced inventories, the U.S. export total is expected to
drop to about 15.4 million tons in 1988-89 from 21.8 million tons
last year. The soybean inventory left over at the end of the current
marketing year will be drawn down to a bare-bones of around 3.4
million tons by the time the 1989 harvest is ready.
   Translated, the U.S. soybean harvest in 1988 of a little more
than 1.5 billion bushels is not enough to meet all domestic and
export demands. Those demands are expected to total almost 1.69
billion bushels.
   As a result, the stockpile of beans from previous harvests will
be tapped to meet the demands, leaving only about 125 million
bushels in reserve when the current soybean marketing year ends in
next Aug. 31, down from 302 million bushels this Sept. 1.
   But those and the market price outlook are only current
projections and USDA economists say the situation will depend
significantly on how new plantings wind up in Argentina and Brazil,
where spring is under way.

<HEAD>Leader Says Catholic Bishops ``Serene'' Amid Talk of Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of America's Roman Catholic bishops
declared, ``We are in a most serene time,'' even though they had
just ended a week that included open dispute with the Vatican and
revival of their sniping at the government.
   Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis was referring in particular
on Thursday to the U.S. church's relations with Pope John Paul II
and the Vatican.
   He pronounced the pope ``bullish on the church in the United
States'' and dismissed public spats with Rome as merely ``signs of a
church that is essentially open.''
   In fact, he and fellow members of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops seemed little troubled by any of the controversy
that swirled about them during their annual meeting that concluded
Thursday.
   During the week, the bishops:
   _Took on the Soviet Union, decrying ``sustained and
comprehensive'' religious persecution in Eastern Europe and
encouraging the U.S. government to hold out prospects of better
overall relations as an incentive to win greater religious freedom.
   _Blasted a U.S. immigration law they say leads employers to
discriminate in hiring and firing Hispanics out of ignorance
concerning potential penalties.
   _Criticized the Reagan administration for sending out thousands
of foreclosure warnings to family farmers a week after the
presidential election and just before the holiday season.
   _On their own turf, accepted but only grudgingly a Vatican
intervention that kept them from voting on guidelines they had
prepared for resolving disputes with theologians.
   _Approved rules for lay preachers that either, according to which
bishop you asked, made it easier for lay men and women to preach
during masses or took one more slap at Catholic women by reiterating
that they may not give the main sermon interpreting the gospel.
   _Finally, sent back a Vatican draft document as ``unsuitable as a
basis for discussion,'' thus rejecting both the scholarship of the
draft and its contention that national bishops conferences have no
real authority in the church.
   May had started the week by congratulating President-elect George
Bush but then in the next breath assuring him the bishops would
continue to speak out on public issues and not ``only in praise and
appreciation.''
   ``We are sometimes criticized for being too concerned about the
world, of pursuing an agenda that in the minds of some critics is
secular, leftist or in some way `ideological,''' May said. But he
added that the pope's own example showed it is not possible to have
``too much social consciousness.''
   On Wednesday, former conference president John Roach, bishop of
St. Paul-Minneapolis, was asked about the arguing that preceded
passage of the bishops' response to the Vatican document on
conference authority, and about the relatively high number of ``no''
votes _ 59 among the 264 voting.
   He acknowledged differences of opinion within the organization,
and suggested some of the negative votes might have included bishops
getting a secret-vote chance to ``take a shot'' at the recent past
presidents who prepared the response.
   But in proclaiming the bishops' serenity on Thursday, May said
there was no big dispute with the Vatican. And he quoted the pope to
support his own contention.
   ``The pope is bullish on the church in the United States _ that's
what he says,'' May declared.
   In recent meetings with U.S. bishops, the pope had said, ``You
are a superpower,'' May told reporters. He said the pope merely
asked the Americans to weigh their words with the knowledge that
``the church in the United States has tremendous international
influence, and the people of the world watch what is said there.''
   ``There are disagreements from time to time'' with the Vatican,
May said, but he added that he didn't see them ``as a tug-of-war or
an ongoing fight or crisis or any of these words that are used.''
   He said the pope often uses the term ``solidarity'' in regard to
the church helping build bridges with the people of the world,
including the most vulnerable as well as the powerful.
   This year's bishops' meeting was significant, May said, partly
because ``we tried to demonstrate solidarity across an amazingly
broad spectrum.''
   Such efforts, he suggested, indicated the conference was alive
and well, whatever the final draft of the Vatican document might say
as to its theological authority.

   A consumer group and the attorney general of
New York filed a petition asking the government to ban some crib
toys they said could harm infants.
   The petition said at least 49 children had been killed or injured
by crib toys over the past 15 years.
   The request was filed Thursday with the Consumer Product Safety
Commission by New York Attorney General Robert Abrams and the
Consumer Federation of America, which is a coalition of more than
250 consumer advocacy organizations.
   The toys in question are crib gyms, mobiles, activity boxes,
suspended stuffed toys, mirrors, music boxes and others marketed for
use in cribs and playpens.
   ``Nothing could be more devastating to a parent than the
knowledge that a toy, purchased to amuse an infant child, ended up
causing that child's death,'' Abrams said. ``The numbers over the
past 15 years indicate a clear need for tougher safety standards if
we hope to prevent additional tragedies.''
   The petition asks the Consumer Product Safety Agency to determine
``that certain crib toys intended for use by children present a
mechanical hazard and therefore are banned hazardous substances.''
   Mary Ellen Fise, spokeswoman for the Consumer Federation of
America, said her organization was recommending that people not buy
these toys for Christmas.
   In their petition, Abrams and the federation cited a 1987
Consumer Product Safety Commission report which found that between
1973 and 1987, 30 deaths, one case of severe brain damage and 18
``near misses'' were caused by crib toys.
   Some children were strangled by pull-cords on the toys while
others got their clothing caught in protrusions and choked,
according to the petition. Another child got his hand caught in a
pull ring and in an effort to disengage it, rolled over and hanged
himself.
   The petition also seeks labels to warn consumers to use the toys
with both ends attached to opposite crib sides. Six incidents,
including one death, have occurred where an unattached end of a crib
gym wrapped around a child's neck, they said.
   The commission staff has estimated that based on 1984 data, there
are approximately 350,000 crib gyms and 800,000 crib mobiles in use.
   ``Unfortunately, this is another case where the CPSC has decided
to look the other way and ignore their own in-house study,'' Fise
said.
   Dave Shiflett, a spokesman for the safety commission, said the
agency had received the petition Thursday and the staff would review
it.
   ``If the staff determines it meets our requirements, it will be
docketed and then further studied by the commission,'' he said.
   Docketing could take as little as 30 days, but the entire
procedure leading up to a decision by the commissioners could take
as long as two or three years, said Doug Noble, another commission
spokesman.

<HEAD>FDA To Require Stronger Aspirin Warning To Pregnant Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is telling
aspirin makers to warn women not to take the popular pain killer
during the last three months of pregnancy lest they risk prolonged
labor and unnecessary bleeding.
   Aspirin products already must carry the standard warning: ``As
with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby seek the advice
of a health professional before using this product.''
   This additional wording would be required under the FDA proposal
issued Thursday: ``IMPORTANT: Do not take this product during the
last three months of pregnancy unless directed by a doctor. Aspirin
taken near the time of delivery may cause bleeding problems in both
mother and child.''
   A similar warning already is required for ibuprofen, the pain
reliever used in such products as Advil and Nuprin.
   Although it could be a year before the FDA will be able to impose
the new labeling requirements formally, officials said aspirin
manufacturers probably will move sooner to comply since there is
little chance the agency will change its mind.
   Indeed, the proposal stems from the virtually undisputed
conclusion of an outside advisory panel that aspirin can contribute
to bleeding problems for both mother and baby and prolong labor and
should be taken only with utmost caution.
   However, there is somewhat less consensus on some companion
proposals contained in what the FDA calls an Internal Analgesic
Monograph published in the Federal Register that deals with a number
of issues involving non-prescription pain relievers.
   For example, it notes that while the outside advisory panel found
insufficient evidence that caffeine increases the effective action
of other ingredients in popular pain relievers, the drug makers have
submitted additional data.
   As a result, the FDA said products such as Excedrin and Anacin
can continue to include caffeine while the issue is reviewed more
fully.
   An accompanying proposal on non-prescription menstrual products
would permit use of caffeine in combination with various pain
relievers to relieve menstrual cramps and discomfort.
   The FDA has concluded caffeine is useful in these applications as
a diuretic, a substance that inhibits the retention of fluids.
   The document also incorporates suggested guidelines for
physicians, in advising their patients on aspirin use, to help
prevent recurrences of transient ischemic attacks _ sometimes called
``little strokes'' _ or heart attack or angina.
   And it says the FDA eventually will settle on label wording on
the effect aspirin may have on reducing the risk of initial heart
attacks.
   The agency said it is awaiting more data from a study published
last winter that suggested a reduction of heart attack risk among
healthy adult males who took an aspirin every other day.

<HEAD>Advocate Judge Urges No Clemency For Corporal Convicted On
Homosexual Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of a Marine Corps recruit depot
has been urged to deny clemency to a female corporal convicted of
homosexual conduct. The woman claims she was promised leniency by a
prosecutor in exchange for her cooperation.
   Cpl. Barbara J. Baum, 24, of Mishawaka, Ind., was convicted at
court martial last June and sentenced to a year in prison as part of
a wide-ranging investigation of alleged lesbian conduct among
instructors at the Parris Island recruit depot.
   She is serving her sentence in a brig at the Quantico, Va.,
Marine Base.
   ``This lady has been in prison for five months already for, in
essence, engaging in private, consensual sexual conduct,'' L.
Barrett Boss, a Washington defense attorney, said Thursday.
   ``She was promised some form of clemency in exchange for
cooperating with investigators after her sentencing, which she
did,'' he said. ``And now the staff judge advocate (lawyer) at
Parris Island is recommending clemency be denied. They certainly
misled her, no question.''
   The Marine Corps denies the prosecuting attorney in the case ever
made a binding promise to the enlisted woman in soliciting her
cooperation with investigators.
   ``If we had done so, we would honor it,'' said Maj. Robert
McLean, a spokesman at Parris Island.
   Earlier this month, in a memorandum dated Nov. 8, the top staff
lawyer at Parris Island recommended that base commander Maj. Gen.
Jarvis D. Lynch deny Baum any clemency.
   Col. Gerald W. Jones, the staff judge advocate, noted briefly in
his memo the prosecutor in Baum's case _ Maj. David Beck _ had
recommended a reduction in sentence because of her ``post-trial
cooperation'' and because of ``corroboration'' of claims that she
had been sexually abused as a child.
   Nonetheless, Jones recommended the general ``approve the sentence
as adjudged.''
   The only explanation Jones offered was a single sentence stating:
``No corrective action based upon trial error or the review
procedure is appropriate.''
   McLean said Thursday he could not elaborate on Jones' reasons for
urging clemency be denied. But the spokesman noted it would be up to
Lynch to decide the matter ``after reviewing everyone's input.''
   ``I can say categorically that there is not now nor was there
ever any agreement consummated between the defense and government
relative to Baum's case for any kind of clemency reduction or
relief,'' the spokesman said.
   ``It is true there was no written agreement between them,''
responded Boss. ``But Barbara Baum did not spent 14 hours being
interrogated under oath by investigators for her health.
   ``She had a clear understanding that in exchange for her
cooperation, she would get clemency. She never would have consented
to going through this ordeal ... if she did not think she was going
to get some clemency.''
   Baum has testified she was sexually abused by several men while a
child and now wants to obtain therapy, the defense attorney said.
   ``There is no treatment available for Cpl. Baum in the Quantico
brig,'' he said.
   Boss said he and another civilian defense attorney, Susan
Masling, would file a response to Jones' memo within a week, setting
the stage for Lynch to rule on the matter.

<HEAD>State Party Leaders Want Kirk To Remain National Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic state party leaders are doing a
post-mortem on yet another presidential election defeat and
appealing to Paul G. Kirk Jr. to serve another term as national
chairman to avert a potentially divisive contest for his job.
   Also on the minds of Democratic leaders are questions about
whether the party needs to re-examine its method of nominating
presidential candidates after its fifth defeat in the last six
national elections.
   ``I don't think we ought to go leaping off any cliffs,'' said
Kathy Vick, a former Louisiana Democratic Party chair.
   ``One thing I'm going to resist and resist as forcefully as I can
is the over-reaction, over-analysis, over-revisionist theory of
politics,'' said Kirk.
   Much of the attention at a two-day meeting of the Association of
State Democratic Chairs beginning today will be on Kirk, who has
refused to say whether he would serve another four-year term. His
term expires in February.
   At least five people who'd like to succeed Kirk planned to attend
the meeting at a resort outside the Arizona capital.
   They include Rick Wiener, the Michigan Democratic Party chairman,
who is president of the state chairs association; Ron Brown, a
Washington attorney who was a top adviser to Jesse Jackson in the
final weeks of his presidential campaign; and three former
congressmen, Jim Jones of Oklahoma, Michael Barnes of Maryland and
Jim Stanton of Ohio.
   When Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis carried only
10 states while losing to Republican George Bush, it still was the
best showing by a Democratic nominee since 1976.
   The Democrats have been on the losing side in five of the last
six presidential elections but have controlled the House for 33
years and have been the majority party in the Senate for 27 of those
33 years.
   While Dukakis was losing, the Democrats added one Senate seat and
three House seats.
   Several state party officials, who had thought 1988 would be a
Democratic year, have been sharply critical of the Dukakis campaign.
   ``The worst campaign of this century,'' said Bob Slagle, chairman
of the Texas Democratic Party.
   Slagle criticized Dukakis for failing to respond quickly and
strongly enough to attacks by the Bush campaign.
   ``We never gave people a reason to vote for us,'' said James
Ruvolo, the Ohio party chairman.
   Kirk has said that party leaders who have asked him to stay on
the job have cited his success at promoting unity among differing
factions.
   ``I'm going to listen to the counsel of a number of the leaders
and elected officials in the party who have said, `Don't say you
won't stay on until we have an opportunity to chat with you about
it.' So, that's my plan.
   ``I owe it to them to visit with them and hear what they have to
say.''
   Kirk ruled out staying on for a partial term.
   At the same time, Kirk dismissed predictions that a fight to fill
the chairmanship would be divisive.
   ``I don't foresee in any circumstances the so-called
blood-letting and the division within the party,'' he said.
   Brown, who has served as deputy party chairman and counsel in the
past, is opposed by activists who believe his election would give
Jackson too much power.
   Brown conceded his chances would depend on reminding party
officials that ``I wasn't born in May (when he joined the Jackson
campaign) and that I did have a life before then.''
   He said many of the people ``who are raising the Jackson
connection are the same ones who were telling me how glad they were
and how wonderful it was'' that he had agreed to be Jackson's
convention manager.
   At the time, Democratic Party officials expressed relief that a
party establishment figure like Brown was going to play a prominent
role advising Jackson.

   A former high school student and his parents
have filed a $2 million libel lawsuit over anti-Semitic slurs and
sexual innuendos printed beside his picture in the 1986 school
yearbook.
   Michael Strauss and his parents, Sheldon and Judith Strauss,
filed the lawsuit in Norfolk Superior Court against the town of
Westwood, Westwood High School officials, two unnamed students and a
publishing company.
   The Strausses say a fictitious, 70-word biographical sketch that
appeared beside their son's senior picture describing him as
``Superjew'' and ``Yidmaster,'' was false and defamatory and caused
him emotional harm. The biography also contained sexual innuendoes.
   The false biography was substituted for Strauss' own statement by
two students and printed in yearbooks distributed to about 250
students. A similar false biography was printed beside the picture
of a student of Lebanese descent.
   School officials asked students to return yearbooks after the
tampering was discovered, but the incident was not made public until
March 1987, months after the yearbooks were distributed.
   School Committee Chairman Joseph Quinn said school officials did
not want to go public for fear of a lawsuit and also because they
wanted to spare the families more embarrassment.
   Neither school officials nor the Strauss family would comment on
the lawsuit.
   Calls made by The Associated Press to the high school and school
committee offices went unanswered Thursday.
   A spokeswoman for the Jostens Yearbook and Publishing Co. in
Minnesota told the newspaper she could not comment on the lawsuit,
but said schools must sign release forms before any yearbooks are
printed.

<HEAD>Bush To Meet Mexican Leader; Panel Offers Advice on Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush, preparing for a
pre-inaugural meeting with Mexico's incoming president, is promising
to consult with Mexican authorities before taking any actions which
affect that country's well-being.
   Bush made the pledge Thursday in a letter he sent to a panel of
prominent Mexicans and Americans who produced a 238-page report
containing a series of recommendations on how to avoid future crises
in cross-border relations.
   The letter also confirmed that Bush plans an early meeting with
Mexican President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who was elected
in July and will take office on Dec. 1. They will meet in Houston
next Tuesday, officials said.
   Bush said the proximity of the U.S. and Mexican presidential
inaugurations offers ``tremendous opportunities'' for the two
countries to work together.
   Bush's deputy national security adviser, Col. Sam Watson,
presented the letter to commission members on receiving a copy of
the report, prepared by the Bilateral Commission on the Future of
United States-Mexican Relations.
   Among other recommendations, the report said unilateral measures
must be avoided on issues affecting the two countries.
   Bush wrote, ``One hallmark of my administration will be close
consultations and a bilateral approach to problem-solving. Your
report will be of great use in the future _ the effort was well
worth it.''
   Mexico has frequently been critical of the United States for
failing to consult adequately on issues of mutual interest.
   Commission co-chairman Hugo B. Margain, a member of the Mexican
Senate and a former ambassador to the United States, said Thursday
the two countries must abandon reliance on unilateral solutions.
   ``Bilateral problems require bilateral solutions,'' he said. ``If
a problem crosses the border, we must search on both sides if we are
to find a solution that works.''
   Joining Margain as commission co-chairman was William D. Rogers,
who held two senior State Department posts during the Ford
administration.
   Before his letter was released by the commission, Bush seemed
surprised when asked at a news conference about reports that he
planned to meet with Salinas next week.
   Since neither side was prepared to announce the meeting, Bush
dealt with it only as a hypothetical possibility.
   ``If such a meeting takes place it will symbolize ... the
importance of our front yard, our neighbors,'' he said, adding that
he has kept in touch with cross border problems in meetings with
Mexican presidents.
   The commission report criticized the Reagan administration's
handling of drug problems. It said the United States placed
excessive emphasis on law enforcement to curb drug smuggling and
that recent increases in funding levels to reduce demand for drugs
will prove inadequate.
   ``The commission urges the U.S. to give top priority to learning
how to reduce demand and to allocate sufficient resources to move
rapidly in attacking this critical problem,'' the report said.
   It suggested that the U.S. government subordinated the drug issue
in its relations with Panama and Honduras because priority was given
to security concerns.
   ``Such obviously selective application of its international
narcotics control policy undermines U.S. credibility with other
countries and with the multilateral institutions pledged to combat
drug abuse,'' the report said.
   The study also covers a number of other contentious issues. Some
excerpts:
   Debt _ ``For Mexico ... debt service obligations in the future
should be designed subject to (its) capacity to pay under conditions
of growth. Without growth, adjustment will not be sustained; without
growth, resources for debt service will not be available.''
   Trade _ ``Both countries should continue to agree to generalized
trade concessions. They should move promptly to free-trade
agreements in all sectors where benefits from free trade may exist,
especially industrial sectors.''
   Migration _ ``Both governments ... should undertake to reach a
bilateral accord on migration, which should consider: a possible
increase in the legal quotas of Mexican migration to the U.S. (and)
an agreement on the flow and treatment of `seasonal agricultural
workers.'''
   Foreign Policy _ ``A first step is to initiate a frank and open
dialogue on the concept of regional security. The commission
believes that regional security involves not only military@strategic
concerns but must also encompass questions of
socio-economic development.''
   Other commission members included former World Bank President
Robert McNamara, San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, and Colegio de
Mexico President Mario Ojeda.

   A Japanese soprano, Yoko Watanabe, sang the title
part as the Metropolitan Opera performed Puccini's ``Madama
Butterfly'' for the first time this season on Thursday night.
   Miss Watanabe made her Met debut in the same role in 1986. She is
enormously effective in the part. Her voice is big but she can make
it seem small, befitting a demure personality. She sounded as fresh
at the end of the opera as at the beginning.
   Miss Watanabe's voice isn't emotional or lushly beautiful but she
delivered the story of love and betrayal by singing the music very
well. She made an affecting Madama Butterfly. The audience responded
with enthusiastic applause.
   Myung-Whun Chung from Korea, who also made his Met debut in 1986,
was conducting this opera for the first time at the Met. He
impresses as a sensitive conductor who knows what he's doing.
   Brenda Boozer of Atlanta sang Suzuki, Butterfly's maid. They were
well cast, both slender young women with attractive voices with
vibrato. They blended well. Sondra Kelly, who has been singing with
the Connecticut Opera, made her Met debut as Kate Pinkerton, a
walk-on. Later this season she will sing in ``Die Walkuere.''
   Giorgio Lamberti has the right kind of focused tenor voice to
sing U.S. Navy Lieutenant Pinkerton. Leo Nucci of Italy sang U.S.
Consul Sharpless. Nucci's voice and deportment seem more impressive
each time he's heard. One paid more attention to Sharpless than
usual, as always happens with medium-size parts when they're well
sung. Fortunately for audiences here, Nucci is singing in four
operas at the Met this season.
   The production dates from 1958, in the old Metropolitan Opera
House. A couple of makeshift wings, which surely could be improved
on, attempt to make it look wide enough for this stage. But it's
still two beautiful sets, of the garden of Butterfly's house and the
interior.

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian lawmakers convened to debate a challenge
to Moscow's authority, and residents of neighboring Latvia today
marked their republic's pre-Soviet independence in another
outpouring of Baltic nationalism. This week in Estonia, the third
Soviet Baltic republic, the parliament declared Estonia's
sovereignty in all matters but defense and foreign affairs. It
passed a constitutional amendment requiring Estonian approval of any
new Soviet law.
   In Lithuania, hundreds of demonstrators converged Thursday on the
parliament building with banners and flags, according to Veleya
Terleckiene. The demonstrators carried flags of formerly independent
Lithuania and banners supporting Lithuanian autonomy, said Ms.
Terleckiene, the daughter of Anastas Terleckas, a leader of the
separatist Lithuanian Liberty League.
   Lithuanians watched on live television as their legislators
convened a session expected to take up a declaration of Lithuanian
as the official language and other laws following Estonia's example.
   Alexander Gelbaf, deputy editor of the official newspaper
Sovietskaya Litva, said in a telephone interview that the parliament
took up only budgetary matters Thursday. He said the constitutional
questions related to relations with the central government would be
debated beginning today.
   Ms. Terleckiene said the entire republic, including members of
the Communist Party, supported initiatives of the grassroots
Lithuanian People's Front being debated in parliament.
   Meanwhile, in Latvia, residents planned demonstrations and
rallies for today, the 70th anniversary of the birth of their
short-lived independent nation.
   The three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were
independent countries between the world wars. The Soviet Union
annexed them in 1940 after a pact with the Nazis.
   The United States backed the Baltic nationalists Thursday. State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington: ``The United
States does not recognize the forcible incorporation of the Baltic
states. ... The people of the Baltic states have been denied their
basic human rights.''
   It is not yet clear how Kremlin authorities will deal with the
latest outburst of Baltic nationalism. On Thursday, they called
Estonian leaders to Moscow to discuss Wednesday's challenge to
central control, but no date has been set for the meeting.
   The Kremlin has shown signs of impatience with the Baltics.
Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, believed to be President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest adviser, said in an interview last
month that the republics will not be allowed to take any major steps
toward independence.
   The Estonian parliament made its challenge under the banner of
the reform effort Gorbachev calls perestroika. The challenge
underscores Gorbachev's problems with rising ethnic feelings that
could spread to other areas.
   Thousands of Baltic people have joined grassroots nationalist
groups. Some say privately their ultimate goal is secession from the
Soviet Union.
   Baltic nationalists have been angered by amendments to the
national constitution proposed by Gorbachev. They say the changes
would shift the little power they now hold to Moscow and eliminate
their constitutional right to secede.

   Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell in the
latest auction to the lowest level in nine months.
   The average yield Thursday was 9.10 percent, down from 9.17
percent at the last auction on May 12.
   It was the lowest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 8.51 percent
on Feb. 4. The bonds will carry a coupon interest rate of 9 percent
with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,897.00.
   A total of $9.03 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling
$21.6 billion.
   The Treasury Department normally auctions 30-year bonds every
three months, but had to cancel the August sale and postpone the
November sale for a week because it previously had sold nearly as
many of the bonds as Congress had authorized.
   But tax legislation signed by President Reagan on Nov. 11 lifted
the limits, paving the way for Thursday's auction.

<TEXT>
   Capitol Hill lawmakers say John Sununu, George
Bush's choice as his new chief of staff, could be a tough advocate
for the new president if he listens and learns the ways of
Washington.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, who debated Sununu several times
on television during the campaign, found him ``tough and competent,
firm in his view ... and he has Bush's confidence.''
   Coelho, the third-raking Democrat in the House, said Bush's
choice nonetheless was a gamble because ``the guy doesn't know
Washington. That's a very important negative.''
   ``I think he can do the job,'' he said. ``The key is does he have
enough personal confidence to surround himself with people who ...
know the power centers in Washington, what makes this city tick.''
   Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who is expected to become the House
Republican Whip in January, said lawmakers understand that Sununu's
first job is to do George Bush's bidding. But he would do well to
hire a strong, experienced liaison with Congress.
   ``I think what Congress expects more than anything else is
understanding ... that we have a legitimate role in the process,''
said Cheney, who served as former President Gerald Ford's chief of
staff. ``It's more a matter of attitude than anything else.''
   Ford, before becoming vice president and then president, was the
House Republican leader, so the staff's congressional experience was
less important. With Reagan, who had no Washington experience,
Capitol Hill relations rested heavily on aides.
   ``My guess is Bush is going to fall somewhere in between,'' said
Cheney, noting that Bush still has a lot of friends in Congress from
when he served in the House for two terms from 1967 through 1970.
   Many lawmakers know Sununu mostly from his role in the Bush
campaign, where the three-term governor was often leading the
harshest attacks against the Democrats. The 49-year-old engineer has
a reputation as a self-assured and somewhat abrasive manager from
his six years in the New Hampshire Statehouse.
   It's a style that could generate friction in the back-rubbing
world of the Capitol.
   Joseph Grandmaison, the New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman,
said Sununu will ``have to cool down his act.''
   ``On a state level, he thinks nothing of dressing down
legislators. The first time he tries to do that to a senior member
of Congress, he'll find his ... effectiveness tremendously
impacted,'' Grandmaison said.
   Bush, in announcing the appointment on Thursday, said he was sure
Sununu could ``build a constructive relationship with Congress.''
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who is running for Senate
Majority Leader, said he was like many in Congress who will wait and
see.
   ``He is widely praised outside of Washington but brand-new inside
Washington,'' he said.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., a Sununu ally from his home state,
said he didn't think getting along with Congress was the most
important task for the new chief of staff.
   ``I would advise him to try to transform Washington and not be
conformed to it,'' Humphrey said. A failing of the Reagan
administration, he said, was that it was sometimes ``too obliging
toward the bureaucracy and the Congress.''
   The appointment of the chief of staff is the president's. It does
not require the approval of Congress. If it did, Sununu certainly
would take heat over his refusal to join 49 other governors in
opposing a United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism.
Because of that stance, several Jewish organizations have expressed
concern about Sununu, whose Lebanese father was a Boston businessman.
   Sununu said Thursday he felt as governor he should not embroil
himself in foreign policy issues. He added that he took pains to
make sure the 1988 Republican platform included a condemnation of
the U.N. resolution.

   A consumer group and the attorney general of
New York filed a petition asking the government to ban some crib
toys they said could harm infants.
   The petition said at least 49 children had been killed or injured
by crib toys over the past 15 years.
   The request was filed Thursday with the Consumer Product Safety
Commission by New York Attorney General Robert Abrams and the
Consumer Federation of America, which is a coalition of more than
250 consumer advocacy organizations.
   The toys in question are crib gyms, mobiles, activity boxes,
suspended stuffed toys, mirrors, music boxes and others marketed for
use in cribs and playpens.
   ``Nothing could be more devastating to a parent than the
knowledge that a toy, purchased to amuse an infant child, ended up
causing that child's death,'' Abrams said. ``The numbers over the
past 15 years indicate a clear need for tougher safety standards if
we hope to prevent additional tragedies.''
   The petition asks the Consumer Product Safety Agency to determine
``that certain crib toys intended for use by children present a
mechanical hazard and therefore are banned hazardous substances.''
   Mary Ellen Fise, spokeswoman for the Consumer Federation of
America, said her organization was recommending that people not buy
these toys for Christmas.
   In their petition, Abrams and the federation cited a 1987
Consumer Product Safety Commission report which found that between
1973 and 1987, 30 deaths, one case of severe brain damage and 18
``near misses'' were caused by crib toys.
   Some children were strangled by pull-cords on the toys while
others got their clothing caught in protrusions and choked,
according to the petition. Another child got his hand caught in a
pull ring and in an effort to disengage it, rolled over and hanged
himself.
   The petition also seeks labels to warn consumers to use the toys
with both ends attached to opposite crib sides. Six incidents,
including one death, have occurred where an unattached end of a crib
gym wrapped around a child's neck, they said.
   The commission staff has estimated that based on 1984 data, there
are approximately 350,000 crib gyms and 800,000 crib mobiles in use.
   ``Unfortunately, this is another case where the CPSC has decided
to look the other way and ignore their own in-house study,'' Fise
said.
   Dave Shiflett, a spokesman for the safety commission, said the
agency had received the petition Thursday and the staff would review
it.
   ``If the staff determines it meets our requirements, it will be
docketed and then further studied by the commission,'' he said.
   Docketing could take as little as 30 days, but the entire
procedure leading up to a decision by the commissioners could take
as long as two or three years, said Doug Noble, another commission
spokesman.

<HEAD>Health Care Workers' Unions Agree to Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two unions representing the majority of
organized health care workers in privately owned hospitals and
nursing homes have agreed to merge.
   The 70,000 members of the National Union of Hospital and Health
Care Employees will be asked in January to approve a plan to merge
with the 875,000-member Service Employees International Union. Both
unions belong to the AFL-CIO.
   ``There's a need for us to consolidate resources and our ability
to win strikes, too,'' Jerome P. Brown, the Hospital Employees
union's secretary-treasurer, said Thursday.
   The industry is changing rapidly in terms of chains taking over
nursing homes and hospitals becoming subsidiaries of holding
companies ``in all types of other businesses,'' he said.
   ``With cost containment pressures coming from the government and
health plan providers, the people who are getting it in the neck are
the workers,'' he said.
   SEIU President John Sweeney said the Hospital Employees would
continue as ``an autonomous national local'' within his union.
   ``When added to the new bargaining unit rules we've finally pried
from the NLRB, the combined strength we now have means we will have
the clout to successfully do battle with the giant conglomerates
gobbling up the hospital industry,'' Sweeney said.
   The Hospital Employees, with a membership that is more than 50
percent black or Hispanic, was the only major union to endorse Jesse
Jackson's presidential candidacy this year.
   It broke off from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store
Union in 1984 and has been seeking a merger partner ever since.
   Local 1199 of the Hospital Employees union and its 75,000 members
in New York City voted to remain a part of the retail clerks union.
   The merger was announced just seven weeks after the National
Labor Relations Board issued proposed new regulations that would
make it much easier for unions to organize hospital workers. Only
about 10 percent of the nation's health care workers belong to
unions.

   Country music star Johnny Lee, who sang
``Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places,'' was looking for
business in the wrong place when he tried to open a nightclub in
north Alabama, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge William Acker of Birmingham dismissed a $5
million lawsuit that Lee and a business partner, Jimmy Cornelius of
Guntersville, filed against the city of Guntersville.
   ``Rather than bring this suit, plaintiffs perhaps should thank
the defendants,'' Acker said, because they kept Lee and Cornelius
from spending money to build a nightclub that never could have
received a liquor license.
   ``Lemonade might not have mixed well with Hank Williams and it is
doubtful that it would have made the cash register ring,'' Acker
wrote in his decision released this week.
   The plaintiffs' attorney, Donald Stewart, was not immediately
available for comment Thursday on whether he would appeal.
   Lee, who moved to Guntersville after singing the hit song from
the movie ``Urban Cowboy,'' wanted to develop a nightclub called
``Johnny Lee Show Palace'' near Guntersville. Liquor sales are legal
in Guntersville, but not in the rural parts of Marshall County.
   In 1986, the Guntersville City Council annexed land along U.S.
431 and zoned it to allow businesses to sell liquor for off-premise
consumption. Lee and Cornelius bought some of the newly annexed
property and applied for a zoning change that would allow them to
sell liquor for consumption in a nightclub.
   The City Council denied the change in April 1987, prompting Lee's
attorneys to file suit, claiming a loss of property rights.
   Acker said the Alabama Supreme Court last year ruled ``long
lasso'' annexations such as Guntersville's illegal. Because of that,
the judge said, Lee and Cornelius ``never had a property right
subject to municipal zoning'' since the property was never legally
in the city.

   They were hobos drifting from town to town,
working odd jobs for long hours and low pay, before they decided to
form a union whose goal was to abolish capitalism.
   That probably never will happen, but after 83 years, the
Industrial Workers of the World, or Wobblies, continue to tilt at
windmills. And they recently won a victory of sorts here when
employees of a state peace group voted to organize in a union.
   Since the ``Continental Congress of the Working Class'' in 1905,
when the union was founded, Wobblies have devoted themselves to
creating ``one big union'' for all workers.
   Despite past government crackdowns and a lack of public sympathy
that has relegated the union to the status of a labor movement
curiosity, Wobblies continue to espouse the virtues of direct-action
such as work stoppages and boycotts.
   ``If everybody absolutely refused to go to work, what the hell
can the government do?'' asked Jenny Velsek, an IWW member since
1921.
   The union's national membership is 900 to 1,000, a far cry from
the 100,000 members it boasted around World War I, but almost double
the 500 members it had in 1987, said Brian Myers, office manager of
the union's Chicago headquarters and editor of the IWW newspaper,
The Industrial Worker.
   ``We like to say the IWW is an organization that has always been
small but whose influence has far exceeded its numbers,'' said
Myers, who is the IWW's only paid staffer, earning $7.50 an hour.
   The Wobblies have organized small pockets of oilfield workers,
loggers, printers, shipbuilders and grocery clerks in locals from
Toronto to San Francisco.
   Recent IWW efforts have focused on the anti-nuclear movement, and
the union's goal is to organize canvassers nationwide, said Billy
Don Robinson of Portland, an IWW activist in the Pacific Northwest.
   An apt metaphor for the Wobblies' recent ``revival'' is the
discovery of some of the ashes of Joe Hill, one of the IWW's most
famous leaders.
   The ashes were found earlier this year in the National Archives
and will be turned over to the union in a ceremony Friday in
Washington, D.C. Most of Hill's ashes were distributed to IWW locals
and scattered on May Day 1916, but some were seized in a raid on the
union's Chicago headquarters in 1917 and eventually found their way
into the archives.
   Hill immortalized the Wobblies in song and poetry before he was
executed in 1915. The day before he was shot in Utah on a charge of
murdering a grocery owner, Hill told colleagues: ``Don't waste any
time in mourning. Organize.''
   Later, Hill's life and death inspired the popular union song that
begins, ``I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night, alive as you or me.''
   National attention first was drawn to the Wobblies _ whose
nickname was taken from a Chinese cook who pronounced IWW ``I wobble
wobble'' _ in 1912, when 25,000 textile workers walked off the job
in Lawrence, Mass.
   Strikers sent their children to other cities to stay with
sympathetic families. Lawrence police tried to block others from
boarding trains headed out of town.
   The ensuing melee, in which women and children were injured,
brought such protests from around the country that management gave
in to the workers' demands. Much of the textile industry followed,
and the IWW chalked up what has been called its greatest triumph.
   Today, the union's reputation for activism remains intact. With
just a few members in each city, Wobblies have been arrested in
Colorado and Nevada for protesting nuclear testing and in Los
Angeles for demonstrating against arms shipments to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   One of the union's biggest victories recently has come in
Portland, where seven canvassers from the anti-nuclear group Oregon
SANE last month voted unanimously to join the IWW. They have not
negotiated a contract yet.
   The canvassers, who raise funds and educate the public about the
group's goals, decided to organize to fight for higher pay and more
say in the organization's decision-making process.
   SANE workers say they didn't want to join a more mainstream union
because they didn't feel they would have a large enough say in how
they would operate. The Wobblies' dues _ $2 a month _ also was a
factor.

<HEAD>How Canada Will Negotiate Its U.S. Trade Pact Depends On Who's
Talking</HEAD>

   How will Canada negotiate with its powerful
southern neighbor after Monday's election decides the fate of the
Canada-U.S. free trade agreement? That depends on which candidate
for prime minister is talking.
   Opposition Liberal Party leader John Turner, who wants to cancel
the deal, says he will tell President-elect George Bush that
President Reagan out-negotiated Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on the
agreement signed in January.
   In a crowd-pleasing routine that has been polished through weeks
of campaigning to place the Liberals in a dead heat with the prime
minister's Progressive Conservative Party, Turner imitates
Mulroney's responses to President Reagan's requests.
   ``Yes, sir, Mr. President,'' Turner replies submissively to each
point with a crisp salute. He charges the prime minister wants to be
``governor of the 51st state.''
   Mulroney resorts to sarcasm as well in his increasingly biting
attacks, describing a potential meeting next year if his rival
becomes prime minister.
   ``Imagine Mr. Turner going to Washington to say, `Hey, President
Bush _ I just tore up the free-trade accord and now if you have 15
minutes, we'll negotiate an acid-rain treaty.
   ``You know what the president would say?'' Mulroney asks. ``He'd
say exactly what your mother-in-law would say _ `Hey, this guy can't
be serious.'''
   Canada claims half the acid rain falling in eastern Canada
originates in the United States, making it one of the most
troublesome issues between the two countries.
   The free trade agreement has been approved by the U.S. Congress
but needs final Canadian parliamentary approval. The socialist New
Democratic Party led by Ed Broadbent also opposes the deal, so only
a Conservative majority victory ensures the agreement will start
taking effect Jan. 1 as scheduled.
   The relationship with Washington attracted special attention
Thursday because of Reagan's speech on international trade in
Washington in which he spoke favorably of the Canadian agreement.
   ``As far as the United States is concerned, the Free Trade
Agreement is an example of cooperation at its best. It is a
testament to the commitment of our two governments to the principles
of the open market and to economic cooperation,'' Reagan said.
   Turner immediately described the speech as intervention in
Canadian affairs.
   ``As a Canadian, and with no anti-American sentiment at all, I
resent the intervention into our election,'' the Liberal leader said
during a campaign stop in Quebec.
   Turner also said the speech was very similar to language used by
Mulroney, adding that such phrases ``could have been written by Mr.
Mulroney and perhaps they were.''
   The Conservatives have denied reports they sought any support or
extra assurances on the agreement from Washington to calm down
Canadian opposition to the pact.
   Broadbent, whose party is expected to finish third with a key
position of influence if the Conservatives or Liberals fail to win a
majority, said Reagan's speech could harm Mulroney's chances.
   ``It will remind every Canadian how close Brian Mulroney is to
Ronald Reagan,'' Broadbent said on a campaign stop in Edmonton,
Alberta. ``It will remind every Canadian the Americans got virtually
everything they wanted in this deal.''
   The Canadian Press news agency said in its report from Washington
on the speech that Reagan ``offered passing praise'' for the deal,
``keeping his remarks as innocuous as possible in a bid to avoid
accusations of trying to influence the outcome of Monday's Canadian
election.''
   U.S. officials have not said whether any retaliation is planned
if Canada decides against the agreement. The two nations already are
each other's largest trading partner, with the $150 billion passing
between them each year making it the world's largest trading
partnership.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Say Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister Defected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister and a
senior diplomat who accompanied Afghanistan's prime minister on his
mission to the United Nations defected last week, according to U.S.
officials.
   The officials said on condition of anonymity Thursday that
Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister, Abdul Ghaffar Lakanwal,
sought political asylum in the United States.
   Authorities say Lakanwal is the highest-ranking member of the
Soviet-backed regime to have defected since Soviet troops entered
Afghanistan in 1979.
   Sources at the United Nations and with the U.S. government could
only identify the other defector as a senior diplomat whose name was
given as Kamal. But the Washington Post, in today's editions,
identified him as Sayed Kamaluddin.
   The Post quoted unidentified U.S. officials as saying Lakanwal,
43, came to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session in
late October to prepare for the visit of the Afghan prime minister,
Mohammed Sharq. He then flew to Washington alone on Nov. 7 and went
to the State Department, seeking asylum, the officials were quoted
as saying.
   Two days later, Kamaluddin, who was part of the Afghan U.N.
delegation and deputy director of the Afghan foreign ministry's
department for internal conferences, defected in the same manner as
Lakanwal, the newspaper said.
   The Post cited unidentified State Department officials as saying
the families of Lakanwal and Kamaluddin were outside Afghanistan and
seeking to join the men in the United States.
   The Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service
has made no decision whether to grant Lakanwal and Kamaluddin
political refugee status, the newspaper reported.
   One official was quoted as telling the Post there was a third
lower-ranking Afghan government official who also has sought asylum
in the United States since July, but the newspaper did not identify
that person.
   Lakanwal's career had been in decline, said Rosanne Klass, a
former New York Times reporter who wrote ``Afghanistan, The Great
Game Revisited.'' He was Agriculture and Land Reform minister from
1981 to March 1987, when he was dropped from the Cabinet.
   No spokesmen were immediately available at Afghanistan's U.N.
mission.

<HEAD>Dollar Recovers Slightly; Stocks Hit Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar recovered slightly in Tokyo Friday after
a heavy beating the previous day, and stock prices set another
record high.
   After opening at 122.15 yen, up 0.63 yen from Thursday's 121.52
yen finish, the dollar edged up, closing the week at 122.40 yen, up
0.88 yen. It ranged between 122.07 and 122.60 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues finished the week at 29,180.20 points, up 103.39
points or 0.36 percent.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's rebound to overnight
dollar-buying by central banks. They said the Bank of Japan
continued actively to buy dollars Friday when the currency was
trading at around 122.10-122.15 yen.
   The intervention Friday followed comments by Japan's Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that Japan and other major monetary
countries are poised to intervene in the market if the American
currency continues its nosedive against the yen.
   The dollar has fallen a hefty 4.36 yen since the start of the
month.
   Speaking during a regularly scheduled press conference, Miyazawa
said the currency stabilization agreement among the seven major
industrialized nations was still intact.
   ``The dollar also rose marginally because market participants
felt it has taken a strong beating from the yen recently,'' said a
dealer with a major Japanese bank.
   ``The dollar may rise slightly next week, but the trend is
downward till the end of the year,'' the dealer added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the rally was led mainly by active
dealings on steel issues which in turn focused attention on other
large-capital stocks, the dealer said.
   ``The strong activity reflects confidence in Japanese economic
fundamentals,'' he said.

<HEAD>Canadian Study Shows Women's Abilities Vary With Hormone Levels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women can talk more fluently and move their hands
more skillfully when their sex hormones are at high levels,
according to a study believed to be the first linking human
performance to sex hormones.
   The research, on 200 women during their menstrual cycle and
post-menopausal women on estrogen-replacement therary, is by Doreen
Kimura of the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario.
   It shows women perform significantly better in verbal fluency and
fine-motor muscular control when their estrogen and progesterone
levels are high.
   Kimura's study also showed that women's ability to perform
spatial tasks is enhanced by lower hormone levels.
   The researcher said similar patterns probably occur in men, whose
sex hormone testosterone fluctuates daily.
   Kimura, who spoke Wednesday at a news briefing during the annual
meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, compared women's spatial
cognition and verbal and motor abilities during times of peak and
low hormone levels.
   The levels rise and fall during the course of a woman's menstrual
cycle. The peak estrogen phase begins just before ovulation and
extends until a week to 10 days before menstruation. A drop in
hormone levels occurs during menstruation.
   Spatial tasks that Kimura tested involved identifying a shape in
a complex pattern. Tongue-twisters tested verbal skills, and
fine-motor tasks included rapid changing of hand postures.
   Men generally do better on such spatial problems, but women on
average score better on the verbal and fine-motor tasks.
   In the low-hormone phase, it might take a woman three seconds
longer to repeat a tongue-twister correctly than during her peak
level, the researcher said.
   ``With motor-tasks, women say, `Gosh, I'm really clumsy this
week,''' said Kimura.
   She said her study supports the idea that male-female cognitive
differences are influenced by sex hormones acting on the brain. She
said she is now studying how men's abilities might vary according to
the level of testosterone.
   ``It's easier to identify these things in women, but my guess is
they can happen also in males,'' said Kimura.
   She acknowledged that the study suggests there may be optimal
times for women to perform certain tasks, such as taking
standardized academic examinations.
   ``We really don't know enough yet,'' she said. ``It may be in a
couple of years we'll know enough about it to say there are
significant enough effects that these can be factors in test scores
and performance.''
   Kimura stressed that abilities vary greatly among individual men
and women, with some women better at tasks in which men generally
excel.
   ``There's an enormous overlap in the ability patterns between men
and women,'' she said.

   A B-1B bomber crashed near Ellsworth Air

Friday.
   The B-1B crashed on the runway as it came in for a landing at
about 1:30 a.m. EST, officials said. There was no immediate word on
the extent of injuries to the crew.
   ``From monitoring the ambulance traffic, they say they were going
to Ellsworth base hospital with four or five patients. We don't know
if they're dead or alive,'' said Lt. Fred Brown of the Rapid City
Police Department.
   However, Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Kudla, a spokesman for the Defense
Department in Washington, said, ``Right now at least it looks like
there were no fatalities.''
   The crash comes two days after officials reported that the Air
Force had inspected and cleared more than two-thirds of the B-1B
bombers grounded following a crash last week that destroyed one of
the long-range planes in Texas.
   Brown said the B-1B crashed on the runway as it came in for a
landing at Ellsworth, which lies on the eastern edge of Rapid City.
He said it did not hit any buildings and no one on the ground was
known to be injured.
   ``Witnesses saw four people eject from the airplane before it
crashed,'' Brown said. ``It is possible that it came in too low and
hit a power pole.''
   ``Ellsworth has told us it was carrying a six-man crew,'' he
said, adding that the jet normally carried four.
   Witnesses reported a downed power line and airplane parts
scattered in the landing area, he said. Power was reported out in
Box Elder, a town south of the base.
   On Nov. 8, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air
Force Base, Texas. It had been the second accident to claim one of
the new bombers in 14 months. In that crash, the crew of four
managed to eject and survived.
   That crash was the third in four years since B-1 aircraft began
flying as the nation's first new long-range bomber in more than 25
years.
   Strategic Air Command spokesman Lt. Col. George H. Peck said
Tuesday that 63 of the 85 B-1B's located at SAC bases had been
inspected as of Tuesday without any problems being detected.
   The Air Force has refused to speculate on the cause of the Texas
crash, although a fire had been observed by witnesses around the
plane's left two engines before the crash. SAC's grounding order
specified a mandatory inspection of electric, fuel and hydraulic
fluid lines.
   In addition to Ellsworth and Dyess, the bombers also have been
deployed to Grand Forks AFB, N.D., and McConnell AFB, Kan.
   The Air Force has been criticized over the past two years for its
handling of the B-1B program, primarily because of acknowledged
problems in developing the bomber's radar-jamming gear. However, the
service insists the plane is the best long-range bomber in the world.

<HEAD>Study of Adventists Suggests Healthy Lifestyles Make Longer Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study that found Seventh-day Adventists can
expect to live longer suggests that others who adopt the healthful
lifestyle of the religious group may also extend their life spans.
   The Seventh-day Adventists' strict approach to diet, exercise,
weight and smoking showed significant association with life
expectancy, said Jan W. Kuzma, a professor of vital statistics at
Loma Linda University in California.
   ``What we choose to do makes a big difference on how long we
live,'' Kuzma said.
   Practicing Seventh-day Adventists abstain from smoking and
drinking alcoholic beverages, and many adopt a vegetarian or
near-vegetarian diet.
   ``This group has unique health practices, and since these are so
highly associated with favorable outcomes, it points to the fact
that what a person chooses to do by not smoking, by not overeating
and by exercising affects life expectancies,'' said Kuzma, who
presented his study Thursday at the American Public Health
Association's annual meeting.
   Kuzma found that a 35-year-old male Seventh-day Adventist was
likely to live to be 82, nine more years than the average California
white male. For females, the advantage was 7.6 years longer.
   The study calculated life tables for a group of 27,514
Seventh-day Adventists _ 9,804 males and 17,710 females older than
age 30 who enrolled in a study in 1960. Kuzma followed up on that
study through 1985 by checking California death records.
   Life expectancies for the Seventh-day Adventists were compared to
figures for the general California population.
   Kuzma's findings prompted differing reactions from other
researchers.
   Dr. Leonard Hayflick, a professor of biogerontology at the
University of California, San Francisco, said he generally is
skeptical of claims that lifestyle factors rather than genetics can
affect longevity.
   ``If you talk to (elderly people) and look at their lifestyle
you'll find nothing in common. One of the few correlations is the
age of death of their six parents or grandparents _ that correlates
pretty good with life expectations,'' he said. ``There's nothing in
lifestyle that will increase life expectation.''
   But Dr. Dean Ornish, also at UCSF, who has studied preventive
medicine and the effect of lifestyle on heart disease, said Kuzma's
findings don't appear to conflict with other research.
   ``I think this is an important study because it adds increasing
evidence that choices that we make as individuals in our lifestyle
are perhaps the most important and powerful determinant of our
health and longevity,'' Ornish said.
   In making comparisons, Kuzma cautioned that the Seventh-day
Adventist population was a controlled group that decreased since
1960 because of deaths, while the general California population,
although matched by age and sex, was continually changing.
   But he said he is confident that the longer life expectancies of
Seventh-day Adventists can be attributed to their healthy lifestyles.
   The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a religious denomination
based on the belief that the second coming of Jesus Christ is near.
The term Seventh-day derives from the group's contention that the
Bible requires observing the Sabbath on Saturday, the seventh day of
the week. Loma Linda University is affiliated with the church.

<HEAD>NRC Staff Calls For Removal Of Obstacle For Seabrook Low-Power
License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says a key
financial issue has been resolved and should no longer be an
obstacle to granting a low-power operating license for the Seabrook,
N.H., nuclear plant.
   The commission ordered Seabrook's owners in September to
``provide reasonable assurance'' that ``adequate funds'' are
available to decommission the plant if the NRC issues a 5 percent
power testing license but eventually refuses to grant a full-power
commercial license.
   The request came because of ``unique and unusual circumstances''
surrounding the financial status of Seabrook. Public Service Company
of New Hampshire, the plant's lead owner, in January became the
first major electric utility to file for bankruptcy protection since
the Depression.
   In a report made available Thursday, NRC staff counsel Gregory
Alan Berry said the owners' decommissioning plan, submitted last
month, was adequate and recommended that the commissioners remove
that regulatory obstacle, one of just two remaining in Seabrook's
quest for a testing license.
   ``The plan ... provides reasonable assurance that funds would be
available to decommission Seabrook Station after low-power operation
if a full-power authorization is not granted,'' Berry wrote. ``Ample
funds are available.''
   The other remaining issue, whether the plant is financially
qualified to run the reactor, also is pending.

<HEAD>Immigrations Board Says IRA Member Can Pursue Efforts to Avoid</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Deportation
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration Appeals Board has ruled that
Joseph Doherty of the Irish Republican Army, wanted for the killing
of a British soldier, should be allowed to proceed with legal
efforts to avoid deportation from the United States.
   Doherty's attorney, Mary Pike, received a copy of the opinion
Thursday. The board had made its decision Monday.
   Under the 3-2 ruling, Doherty is entitled to a hearing before an
immigration judge where he could present claims for political asylum
and withholding of deportation. Doherty would have to show a
well-founded fear of persecution to substantiate an asylum claim.
   On June 14, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III refused a
request by Doherty to be deported to Ireland instead of to Britain.
That order was appealed.
   The government may appeal the latest ruling to Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh.
   Doherty has been held in a federal jail _ the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in lower Manhattan _ for five years while courts
weighed whether the slaying was a political act, for which he could
not be extradited to Britain.
   Doherty was convicted in 1981 of killing a British Army captain
in an ambush on a British convoy in Belfast. In the closing days of
his trial, Mr. Doherty escaped from a prison in Northern Ireland and
fled to the United States, where he was arrested in 1983.

<HEAD>Summer Drought Effects Still Felt on Many U.S. Waterways</HEAD>

   The summer drought is not over for the nation's
waterways, according to government scientists.
   A report released Thursday showed that nearly 40 percent of
streams in the lower 48 states had below-normal flow during October.
   ``When will the drought be over? I don't know,'' Tom Ross,
supervisory hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said in a
statement.
   Precipitation was well above average in September in much of the
country and above average in the East in October. Ross said
precipitation through February in mountain areas and through the
spring in the Southeast would determine whether flow moved closer to
normal.
   Monitoring stations on 53 percent of western streams reported
below-normal October flow. Forty-six percent of Great Lakes streams
were below normal but only 28 percent of those in the Northeast.
   The ``Big Three'' rivers _ the Columbia, Mississippi and St.
Lawrence _ averaged a combined 324 billion gallons per day, 22
percent below normal but well above the record low of 257 billion
gallons per day in October 1936.

<HEAD>Local Reliance on Federal Aid Is Dropping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau says state and local
government reliance on federal aid last year sank to its lowest
level in more than 20 years.
   From a high of 18.7 cents per dollar of state and local
government revenue in 1978, the federal contribution withered to
13.6 cents in 1987. It was the lowest since 1966, when Lyndon
Johnson was gearing up the Great Society programs and the federal
contribution was 13.5 cents per dollar.
   Total federal aid actually has risen throughout the period _ from
$70 billion in 1978, to $113 billion in 1986 to $115 billion in
1987. But it is increasing at a slower rate than other state and
local government revenues.
   While the federal contribution grew at an average of 5.7 percent
a year from 1978 to 1987, the amount raised by state and local taxes
grew an average of 8.5 percent a year.
   Last year, state and local taxes grew 8.6 percent to $405.1
billion, while federal aid increased only 1.7 percent. Revenue from
all sources totaled $842.6 billion.
   Henry Wulf, a Census Bureau analyst, said the federal share
likely will slip again in future years because state and local
governments will be increasing spending to upgrade
``infrastructure'' items such as sewers and roads.

   Governments and financial organizations
have pledged $500 million in flood relief and reconstruction to
Bangladesh, less than one-half of the $1.13 billion requested by
Bangladesh and the United Nations.
   The United Nations made the announcement Wednesday. About $200
million of the $500 million already has been contributed for
short-term flood relief and long-term reconstruction and
rehabilitation.
   Early in September, Bangladesh was ravaged by the worst floods of
this century. The floods killed hundreds of people and inundated
much of the countryside of the Asian nation, one of the world's
poorest.
   Contributions were announced by numerous U.N. organizations and
other world bodies. They included $182 million from the United
States, $130.5 million from Canada and $95 million from the
International Monetary Fund.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a landlady suspected of
killing seven tenants for their Social Security checks accused the
media and police of turning the case into a ``circus.''
   Public defenders Peter Vlautin and Kevin Clymo criticized the
Sacramento Police Department for transporting Dorothea Montalvo
Puente from Los Angeles to Sacramento in a jet chartered by a
television station and allowing a reporter to interview her.
   ``It's unheard of that a law enforcement agency would team up
with a news organization to transport a person to jail,'' Vlautin
said.
   Bill George, assignment editor for the station, KCRA-TV in
Sacramento, said Thursday night that the reporter, Mike Boyd, was
``only doing a good job.''
   ``(He) was just being an aggressive journalist,'' said George.
``No deal was made with police. They needed a way to get back (to
Sacramento) and we offered one.''
   George added that there were no commercial flights at the time.
   Puente, 59, who vanished early Saturday after police unearthed
the first of seven bodies buried in her yard, was arrested in Los
Angeles late Wednesday. She appeared briefly Thursday in Municipal
Court here, but did not enter a plea to a single murder count.
   Assistant District Attorney Dan Kinter told the judge that
additional counts and special circumstances would be filed. Special
circumstances means the penalty upon conviction could be death or
life in prison without parole.
   Puente was ordered held without bail. Vlautin and Clymo were
appointed to represent her, and the case was continued to Dec. 15.
   Police have not identified any of the bodies, but have a list of
25 people, mostly impoverished elderly people on Social Security,
who have lived at Puente's eight-bedroom rooming house and whose
whereabouts are unknown.
   During the television interview, Puente denied any involvement in
the deaths.
   ``I have not killed anyone,'' Puente said on the plane. ``I told
you that. I have not killed anyone. The checks I cashed, yes.''
   The reporter said he didn't ask her about the murders and she
volunteered her denial. She also told him, ``I used to be a very
good person at one time.''
   Puente has a criminal record dating to a 1948 conviction for
forging checks. She served 2{ years in prison in the 1980s for
drugging and robbing three men she met in a bar, and remains on
parole for a separate federal forgery conviction.
   Her attorneys said they were infuriated that Puente was
interviewed without a lawyer being present.
   Puente was put on the jet with detectives and the television crew
with ``no opportunity to talk to anybody who had her interests in
mind,'' said Clymo.
   ``Our client denies killing anybody. The true facts will come out
in the courtroom,'' said Vlautin. ``The Sacramento Police Department
has enlisted the aid of the media to create a circus atmosphere.''
   Police Chief John Kearns said at a news conference he did not
learn about the jet arrangements until Thursday morning. The plane
arrived in Sacramento just before 5 a.m.
   ``The matter is being looked into at the present time,'' he said.
   Kearns said police did not have enough evidence to arrest Puente
after the first body was found, but he admitted investigators erred
in not following her. She apparently boarded a bus for Los Angeles,
Kearns said.
   She checked into a downtown motel there, using the name of Donna
Johanson, police said. At a nearby bar she met Charles Willgues, a
67-year-old pensioner.
   Willgues said he became suspicious after Puente quizzed him about
his Social Security benefits. Willgues, who receives Social Security
and other disability benefits, said Puente asked him where he got
his money and then suggested that they share an apartment.
   ``She seemed nice and sincere. I found her very believable,'' he
said.
   But her face seemed familiar, and he remembered seeing her on a
morning newscast on CBS. He called the network's bureau, and
eventually went there and identified a photo of Puente. Police were
notified, and Puente was arrested at her motel.
   Kearns said police would attempt to identify the bodies and would
look at Puente's bank accounts. At least one of the missing tenants
had designated Puente as payee of his pension checks.
   Several organizations had sent people to live at Puente's home
over the years, which she rented from the owners. Police went to the
house a week ago when one social worker complained that she had not
seen one of the men since August.
   That man, Alvaro Montoya, a 52-year-old mentally disabled person,
is the one Puente is accused of killing.

<TEXT>
   Residents of this pristine island town
are luring city dwellers with offers of low-cost land and homes in
an attempt to stop Frenchboro from becoming just another tourist
spot along Maine's scenic coast.
   Sanford Lunt, his family and their neighbors developed the
homestead plan after years of watching residents forsake the island
for the mainland.
   The first homesteaders arrived recently, and by Christmas the
rest are expected to be living on the island, most of which is owned
by the heirs of Nelson Rockefeller.
   ``These people are great,'' said Steve Beote, a 27-year-old
electrician who moved from Salem, Mass. ``You don't find people like
this in Massachusetts anymore.''
   Beote's and six other families were chosen from about 300
applicants to move onto the 2,500-acre island, officially called
Long Island, across Blue Hill Bay from the mainland.
   Between 1960 and 1980, Frenchboro's population dropped from 57 to
43 as young residents left for the mainland and older residents died.
   About the same time, vacationers discovered the island, with its
clear, accommodating harbor and proximity to the popular resort town
of Bar Harbor, 25 miles away by boat.
   The island's attractiveness concerned residents, who prefer a
relaxed life without distractions from the outside world, said Lunt,
78, the island's oldest resident.
   ``We're getting down in population, and if it gets down too far
it might be all summer people,'' Lunt said, with bent nails
protruding from his mouth as he repaired a lobster trap. ``We don't
want that to happen.''
   A twice-a-week ferry that takes 40 minutes connects the mainland
with the island, which has no doctors, year-round stores, public
telephones or traffic lights.
   Islanders say life has a special meaning here, and as if to prove
the point, they feed plump ``wild'' deer by hand and ducks and geese
outside their doorsteps.
   ``It's a good place, it's quiet and you don't have to worry about
anyone breaking in on you at night,'' said Lunt.
   The homesteaders who have already arrived have been helping to
build their own houses in thick, pine woodland, about a half-mile
from the Atlantic Ocean. The rest of the town faces the harbor,
where lobstermen sell their catch to a wholesale lobster pound.
   The seven homestead families are renting the newly built homes
for three years, and later will purchase them at below-market
prices. The homes are scattered among about 55 acres of land donated
by wealthy heirs of Rockefeller, the late vice president. The
construction was paid for with $400,000 in federal community
development money.
   Walter Pietrowski, who moved to the island a few months ago, said
Frenchboro offers a tranquility he never found amid the hustle and
bustle of New Haven, Conn., where he, his wife and three children
lived.
   ``Sometimes you sit and you just don't hear anything,'' said
Pietrowski. ``It's strange, but I like it.''
   Pietrowski and the other homesteaders were awarded their land and
homes after a selection and screening process by a panel of
islanders and state officials.
   Most of the homesteaders have young families, and the men have
worked in trades as carpentry and and pipe fitting.
   Kerry Hartman, hired to educate the island's seven elementary
schoolchildren in its one-room schoolhouse, said that what attracted
him to Frenchboro, among other things, was the harbor, which is
littered only with lobster buoys.
   ``It's like having Arcadia National Park in your back yard,
except there's no tourists,'' said Hartman, a 26-year-old Bar Harbor
transplant. The national park comprises most of the island on which
Bar Harbor is located.
   Much of the credit for saving the island goes to the Lunts, whose
ancestors settled here in 1822. The family, which makes up half the
island's population, was the impetus behind the homesteading
project, and have made sure all the newcomers are warmly welcomed.
   ``It's more a family than it is a town,'' said Warren ``Pard''
Higgins, an island lobsterman. ``Everybody helps everybody out
whenever there's a problem.''

<TEXT>
   In Japan, rice is everything from a staple food to a
cultural constant, a matter of national security, a base of
religious faith. Besides, the paddy dikes help control floods.
   But for Stephen Gabbert, president of the U.S. Rice Millers'
Association, ``Japan's rice policy is a fantastic example of
economic distortion and it basically stinks.''
   On Thursday, he denounced what he called Japan's ``mythology of
rice'' and said Detroit could just as well have raised the
automobile as a sacrosanct aspect of American society to stop Japan
from selling cars in the United States.
   ``We shouldn't have any sacred or cultural cows in trade
relationships,'' he said at a news conference with foreign
journalists. ``These kinds of sensitivities should not be reasons
for avoiding confronting trade issues.''
   Gabbert accused Japan's agricultural cooperatives of being ``an
evil empire,'' of raising ``hysteria and shock'' and of
misrepresenting his case for a modest opening of the market.
   He said Japan could start easing some of its social problems _
such as high land, housing and food prices _ by liberalizing its
heavily-controlled rice market.
   Such salvos have a hard time penetrating the wall Japan has
erected around its rice market. In September, the Diet, or
parliament, passed a resolution calling rice production ``a major
matter of concern for all Japanese as the basis of maintaining and
developing a sound society in our country.''
   The resolution firmly rejected U.S. calls to rescind the
country's ban on rice imports.
   The U.S. association proposes that 2.5 percent of the market be
opened to imports annually for four years. U.S. producers, with 25
percent of their fields now idle, could not take more than 10
percent of Japan's market, he said, valuing the U.S. stake at $300
million a year.
   He said the U.S. rice crop was 6 million to 7 million metric tons
a year. Japan's harvest was 10.7 million metric tons in 1987 but is
expected to fall to 9.91 million metric tons this year because of a
cool and rainy summer.
   If Japan opened its market, he said, urban rice paddies could be
used for housing, alleviating the high price of homes and perhaps
letting more people live closer to work and reduce the agony of
commuting.
   Rice farmers have inordinate political power, he said, and
opening the market would give urbanites their rightful strength.
   Gabbert said Japan's rice-based system leads to artificially high
food prices, costing consumers $60 billion a year. If some of that
cash could be spent on manufactured imports, it would cut Japan's
troublesome trade surplus.
   International farming statistics show the average price of rice
here is $1.75 a pound, compared with 45 cents a pound for U.S.
consumers.
   Japanese farmers tend to stay with rice because the government
buys their production at a guaranteed price, while other crop prices
fluctuate with the market.
   In their defense, the Japanese say the government lowered the
control price 5.9 percent last year. The price differential is
largely the result of the recent fall of the dollar, they say.
   On his 20th visit to Japan in 15 years, Gabbert said he was
examining the options as his association decides when to refile its
petition accusing Japan of an illegal trade barrier.
   President Reagan's administration decided in late October not to
accept the last petition, but warned that Japan must be
accommodating in trade negotiations starting Dec. 5 in Montreal,
otherwise Washington may change its mind.
   Gabbert said his association may advance the issue after the
inauguration of President-Elect George Bush, who said during the
campaign he favored pressing Japan to open its rice market.
   It would be a tough decision for Bush, for Tokyo has warned there
will be a ``very violent'' reaction, in the words of Deputy Foreign
Minister Michihiko Kunihiro, if Washington starts ``a sort of
prosecution.''

   The Soviet Union today recognized the declaration
of an independent Palestinian state, saying Palestinians have shown
great realism and had the right to their own homeland.
   ``Faithful to the fundamental principle of freedom of choice, the
Soviet Union recognizes the proclamation of the Palestinian state,
being guided by the realization that a comprehensive settlement will
lead also to the practical completion of the historic process of
creating this state,'' said First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh.
   Bessmertnykh told a hastily called news briefing that while
proclaiming an independent state, Palestinians had displayed ``a
great deal of responsibility and realism'' during their
deliberations earlier this week.
   The Palestine National Council, the policy-making body of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, on Tuesday declared an
independent Palestinian state and said it conditionally accepted a
U.N. resolution affirming Israel's right to exist.
   The Soviet Union's recognition comes at a time when it is moving
toward closer diplomatic ties with Israel after years of support for
its Arab enemies.

   Millions of Americans who suffer from depression
may benefit from new research linking the mood disorder in
Alzheimer's patients to deterioration in certain areas of the brain,
a doctor says.
   Researchers said Thursday that depression in Alzheimer's
sufferers may be caused by deterioration in parts of the brain that
produce chemicals believed to keep people upbeat.
   One of the researchers, Dr. George S. Zubenko, director of
geriatric health services at Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic in Pittsburgh, suggested that the findings could help
research into depression in general.
   ``Our study makes a suggestion of where in the brain
investigators or researchers may look for more subtle changes that
are probably associated with typical forms of depression in younger
patients who aren't demented,'' he said.
   Theories about depression center on the belief it is caused by
low activity of chemical messengers in the brain called
neurotransmitters. They permit nerve cells to communicate with each
other and are believed to be key in maintaining normal levels of
optimism, energy, appetite, sound sleep and interest in pleasurable
activities.
   About 30 percent of Alzheimer's patients suffer symptoms of
depression, but contrary to popular belief, depression is not a
``normal'' accompaniment to Alzheimer's, said Dr. Jacob H. Fox,
director of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago.
   Still, hundreds of thousands of the estimated 2.5 million people
with Alzheimer's must cope with the burden of being depressed in
addition to their progressive loss of memory, judgment and mobility.
   To explore what might be causing their depression, the
Pennsylvania researchers performed autopsies on the brains of 37
patients with dementia, or loss of mental function. Most were
Alzheimer's victims, including 14 who also were diagnosed with major
depression.
   For comparison, the researchers studied brain tissue from seven
non-demented elderly patients.
   The depressed subjects showed significantly more evidence of
deterioration in two areas of the brain stem than the non-depressed
subjects, the researchers found.
   These parts of the brain produce two neurotransmitters believed
to be important in keeping people free of depression. One of the
neurotransmitters is norepinephrine, which is involved in mood and
sleep cycles, and the other dopamine, which is involved in physical
movement and in thinking and mood.
   The researchers concluded that abnormalities in the
neurotransmitter system may give rise to the depression in demented
patients.
   Alzheimer's accounts for about 60 percent of U.S. cases of
dementia, multiple small strokes account for another 10 percent, a
combination of the two another 10 percent and the remaining 20
percent have a ``hodgepodge'' of causes, Fox said.
   He said the Pennsylvania findings confirm work done before, but
the newer study represents a large number of patients and
``careful'' and ``convincing'' work. The findings were reported in
the November issue of the Archives of Neurology, a publication of
the Chicago-based American Medical Association.

<HEAD>Snow Piles Up In Western Mountain Regions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a foot of snow piled up in Colorado, Utah and Nevada
early today, and strong winds accompanying the storm system howled
through the Southwest.
   Two-foot drifts blown by strong winds were measured near Austin,
Nev. Gusts reached 39 mph at Daggett, Calif.
   Showers were scattered in southeast Texas and eastern Florida.
   Snowfall was generally light this morning in the northern Rockies
and parts of the northern Plains.
   Snow accumulations in the Colorado Rockies reached more than 12
inches. A warning for heavy snow was in effect for the state's
mountain areas. In Utah, a few inches fell in the valleys and up to
14 inches at the Alta and Sundance ski resorts.
   Today's forecast: snow over the northern and central Rockies,
South Dakota and western Nebraska; scattered showers and
thunderstorms for parts of the central Plains and the middle and
lower Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures should be 10 to 20 degrees colder than normal from
the Rockies across western parts of the Dakotas and western
Nebraska. Highs should be in the 20s from northern Minnesota to the
northern Rockies; in the 30s and 40s from the northern half of New
England through New York state, the Great Lakes, Iowa, Missouri,
Nebraska, Kansas and the central and southern Rockies, and the
northern Pacific coast.
   Temperatures should reach the 70s from southern South Carolina
across northern Florida and the Gulf Coast to eastern and
south-central Texas. Highs should be near 80 degrees in southern
Texas and in the 80s in Florida; the 50s and 60s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Glasgow, Mont., to 80 degrees at Homestead (Fla.) Air
Force Base.

   A group representing millions of Jews in North
America plans to fight the ``who is a Jew'' amendment proposed in
Israel, but will try to prevent the dispute from affecting
fund-raising for Jewish causes, the group's leaders say.
   ``If in a family mistakes are made ... we do not punish,'' said
Shoshana S. Cardin, immediate past president of the Council of
Jewish Federations.
   The council's 3,000-member General Assembly, meeting here, voted
Thursday to adopt a resolution calling on political factions in
Israel to take the question of ``who is a Jew'' out of political
bargaining.
   ``The issue, with its ideological, moral and communal
implications, should not be decided in the context of political
accommodation of or ensuring the maintenance or downfall of a
particular government. World Jewry should not be divided by a
political approach to the issue of `who is a Jew,''' said a
resolution adopted by voice vote. One voice dissented.
   The council, which says it represents 95 percent of the 5.5
million to 6 million Jews in the United States and Canada, will send
a mission to Israel to lobby against the proposal, encourage member
federations to do the same and sponsor a petition drive.
   But it also will urge people to continue giving to fund-raising
campaigns, which spokesman Frank Strauss said are expected to raise
$850 million this year to support Jews in the United States, Canada
and overseas.
   ``Such support and contributions are for needs of the people of
Israel, not any government of the moment, and those needs have not
lessened, they have increased,'' said a resolution adopted Thursday.
   Religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in Israel's
elections Nov. 1 and probably will hold the balance of power in a
coalition government being formed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
of the right-wind Likud bloc.
   In exchange for ultra-Orthodox support, Shamir promised to back
legislation under which only Orthodox rabbis could approve
conversions to Judaism. It would take the form of an amendment to
the Law of Return, which gives Israeli citizenship to any Jew who
seeks it.
   Current law defines a Jew as anyone born to a Jewish mother or
converted to Judaism. The proposed change would add ``in accordance
with Halacha,'' or Jewish religious law, thereby nullifying
conversions performed by Reform and Conservative rabbis, who don't
strictly observe such requirements.
   That might apply directly to only a few people each year but
would divide all Jews, said council leaders.
   ``We are dealing with a perceived disenfranchisement of millions
of American Jews who will feel they have been written out,'' said
Cardin.
   American Jews for the most part belong to the Reform or
Conservative movements of Judaism.
   She said North American Jews have a right to speak out and be
heard on the question both because of the role Jews around the world
had in Israel's formation and because they are part of ``Klal
Israel,'' or Jewish unity.
   As a religious issue, she said, it shouldn't be before the
Knesset, the Israeli parliament. She said the group also opposed
extending the authority of rabbinic courts, which settle questions
of marriage and divorce, to include the question of who is a Jew.
   Strauss said the mission to Israel will leave Sunday. He said it
will be made up of representatives of the Council of Jewish
Federations, the United Jewish Appeal, United Israel Appeal, United
Israel Appeal of Canada, and Karen Hayesod, the fund-raising
organization outside the United States.

<HEAD>Kentucky Leads Nation In Smoking-Related Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky has the highest rate of smoking-related
deaths in the United States and Utah the lowest, federal researchers
say.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control report Thursday came on the
same day as the Great American Smokeout, the American Cancer
Society's yearly attempt to persuade smokers to give up the habit,
even if just for a day.
   The CDC reported that Kentucky had 176 smoking-related deaths for
every 100,000 residents in 1985; West Virginia was next, with 172.
   Utah had 45 such deaths for every 100,000 people.
   Nationwide, smoking-related diseases killed 314,574 Americans
that year.
   The worst states, after Kentucky and West Virginia, were
Arkansas, with 164 smoking-related deaths per 100,000 people in
1985; Rhode Island, 164; and Florida, 161.
   Best on the list, after Utah: Alaska, 54; Hawaii, 77; New Mexico,
85; and Colorado, 94.
   The report is based on computer analysis of statistics from 1985,
the latest CDC data available.
   Even though the state-by-state totals are not adjusted for age _
to compensate for areas with more older or younger people _ the
rates provide valid ``ballpark comparisons,'' said Dr. Thomas
Novotny, a specialist in the CDC's Office of Smoking and Health.
   For instance, it stands to reason that Utah, with its large
Mormon population that abstains from using tobacco, would have a
lower rate of death from smoking than other states, he said.
   The report itself gave no possible explanations for the differing
death rates.
   The CDC estimates the smoking deaths through a mathematical
formula, counting deaths from diseases that can be caused by smoking
and factoring in the prevalence of smoking in that particular state.
   Although there might be cases not easily pinpointed _ a
chain-smoking Kentucky coal miner, for example _ ``the
tobacco-related illnesses far outweigh the risk of other
exposures,'' Novotny said. ``These other things are not something
that we think will complicate the calculations enough to make them
invalid.''
   ``Even as smoking prevalence declines in this country,'' the CDC
said, ``smoking-attributable illness will continue to produce an
enormous disease burden well into the 21st century.''
   About 27 percent of the nation's adults are smokers, according to
the latest national estimate. Four decades ago, it was 41 percent.
   ``We still have a lot of work to do to prevent people from dying
from smoking-related illnesses,'' Novotny said.
   Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory
disease. The surgeon general has warned of both the potentially
fatal risks of smoking and the addictive properties of nicotine, the
active drug in cigarettes.
   The CDC also examined the effects of smoking in causing premature
death; the agency calculated ``years of potential life'' lost, or
how far short of one's life expectancy a smoker dies. U.S. life
expectancy is about 72 years, depending on variables such as sex and
race.
   On average, smoking deaths resulted in about 72 years of
``potential life'' not lived among every 100 Americans in 1985.
   Most smoking deaths, Novotny said, occur in people over age 65.
``Chronic lung disease goes on for a long time,'' he said. ``You may
be alive for 20 years with it, but that doesn't mean you're not
sick.''

<TEXT>
   Three charred poles rising from a
thicket are all that remain of the jungle pavilion where the Rev.
Jim Jones led more than 900 Americans to their death in a macabre
ritual 10 years ago.
   The Jonestown suicide-massacre still haunts this impoverished
land of 780,000 on the northern coast of South America, and its
image abroad may be permanently tainted by one of history's most
bizarre disasters.
   ``Once you leave the shores of Guyana, that's the first thing you
have to face,'' said Alice Thomas, an editor for the independent
newspaper Stabroek News. ``Guyana and Jonestown go together.''
   Many Guyanese regard Jones' San Francisco-based Peoples Temple as
an American aberration that had nothing to do with Guyana other than
its location. Successive governments have disassociated themselves
from the affair.
   ``It's really hard for us to explain what motivated 900 Americans
to take their lives,'' said Patrick Denny, a government spokesman.
``If the media didn't show any interest, we wouldn't have remembered
that it was 10 years'' since the tragedy.
   But Capt. Gerry Gouviea, 32, clearly recalls the carnage wrought
by Jones on Nov. 18, 1978, when the cult leader urged his disciples
to drink grape-flavored punch laced with potassium cyanide. Most
were poisoned, some forcibly. Some were shot by security guards.
   In all, 913 people, including Jones, died. He was found with a
bullet wound in the head. It is is not known whether he was shot or
committed suicide.
   A second lieutenant in Guyana's air force at the time, Gouviea
went in a few days later to help recover bodies for burial in the
United States. Most lay at the roofed pavilion where Jones held
communal meetings and twice-monthly suicide drills known as ``White
Nights.''
   ``The magnitude of the thing was so great that you were hoping it
was going to just rewind (like a video) and everybody was going to
get up and everything was going to be all right,'' Gouviea said.
   ``I remember looking at the children and feeling pity and
wondering who were the adults who did this thing.''
   The massacre occurred hours after Rep. Leo Ryan, D-Calif., three
newsmen and a Temple defector were shot to death in an ambush at
nearby Port Kaituma airstrip. Eleven people, including Richard
Dwyer, a U.S. diplomat in Guyana, were wounded.
   Ryan had flown to Guyana to investigate reports that Jones was
abusing his followers.
   Jonestown ranged over 300 acres carved from dense tropical rain
forest 140 miles from Georgetown, the capital. Dozens of cottages,
workshops and dormitories sat in tidy rows.
   Pursuing the ideals of socialism and racial harmony, Jones and
his 950 or so disciples _ 70 percent of them black, 25 percent white
and the rest mulatto, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian _
cultivated a citrus grove and vegetable garden, raised chickens and
pigs, made their own shoes, educated their children, and cared for
the old and sick.
   Now, Jonestown has all but vanished, stripped by villagers and
consumed by a fire a few years ago.
   The site is littered with artifacts: a rusted filing cabinet
where Jones' house used to be; a small organ; a truck, crane and
trailer; lime, orange and grapefruit trees still bearing fruit.
   Maj. Gen. Norman McLean, head of Guyana's armed forces, said the
army occupied the former commune in 1981 and tried to keep it going
as an agriculture cooperative with 200 sheep.
   But superstitious villagers refused to work there, he said.
   ``Just the thought of 900 people out there and everybody dying _
it's horrifying,'' the general said. ``That smell lingered for more
than a year, the smell of death.''
   Eventually, the army abandoned the site to the jungle.
   Under pressure from allegations of misconduct, Jones moved most
of his Peoples Temple from San Francisco to Guyana, the only
English-speaking country in South America, in 1977. The cult leader
was obsessed with fear of nuclear was and believed Guyana would be
safe.
   He also believed he would be safe from what he perceived as media
and police persecution.
   It was convenient for the late socialist President Forbes Burnham
to allow the Americans to settle in a region claimed by neighboring
Venezuela, said the Rev. Andrew Morrison, editor of Guyana's
Catholic Standard newspaper.
   Morrison, who has compiled extensive files on the Jonestown
affair, said Jones gave Burnham financial and political support.
   ``They came and joined in May Day parades and that sort of
thing,'' he said.
   Larry Layton, the only Temple member charged in connection with
Ryan's killing, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987. He was
convicted by a federal court in San Francisco of conspiracy, aiding
and abetting in Ryan's death, and attempted murder in the wounding
of Dwyer.
   In handing down the sentence, Chief U.S. District Judge Robert
Peckham made Layton eligible for parole in 1991, saying ``a just
sentence requires consideration of the environment in which Layton
and other members were virtually imprisoned.''
   A Guyanese court convicted another Temple member, Chuck Beikman,
in 1979 for his role in the throat slashings of cult spokeswoman
Sharon Amos and her three children, but he was deported after
serving nine months. The same court acquitted Layton on a
technicality.

   The verdicts culminated a three-year trial which focused on the
role of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition formed
in 1983 to press for black political rights. The state alleged that
the front incited anti-government violence in black townships in
1984, while the coalition's leaders said they advocated peaceful
protest.
   Three of those convicted of treason were senior front leaders who
had spent 40 months in jail without bail _ Popo Molefe, 36, who was
the coalition's national secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, who was its
chief spokesman, and Moses Chikane, 40, a leader of its Transvaal
Province branch.
   Also convicted of treason was the Rev. Thomas Manthatha, an
activist in an area called the Vaal Triangle south of Johannesburg
where the first wave of unrest erupted in September 1984.
   Sentences will be issued after mitigation arguments scheduled to
begin Dec. 5.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects PTL Bids, Sets December Date For New Auction</HEAD>

   The PTL ministry is on the auction block
again after a federal bankruptcy judge rejected two offers and
threatened to liquidate the evangelical empire if a sale is not
completed by Dec. 13.
   ``We're not losing sight of the promised land,'' said Sam
Johnson, president of Heritage Ministries at PTL, responding to
Thursday's decision by Judge Rufus Reynolds to reopen bidding on the
ministry's assets.
   Thursday's auction was expected to close the books on the
ministry that Jim and Tammy Bakker built before a sex-and-money
scandal forced it to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its
creditors.
   Reynolds said the offers presented by the only two qualified
bidders _ Canadian businessmen Stephen Mernick and Peter Thomas _
failed to meet the earlier financial conditions he set.
   As a result, he scheduled another auction Dec. 12 and said he
would convene court the following day to hear its results and decide
on a sale of the 1,700 acres, satellite television ministry and
Heritage USA theme park at the Fort Mill-based ministry.
   Reynolds said if negotiations failed, he would close the doors
and sell off the ministry.
   ``It's either then or nothing,'' Reynolds told a packed federal
courtroom.
   Reynolds had set Thursday as the deadline for wrapping up a
seven-month effort to arrange a sale of the assets.
   But the $115 million bid by Mernick, a 34-year-old rabbi and
businessman from Toronto, did not provide adequate assurances that
the remaining $65 million would be paid after an initial $50 million
down payment, Reynolds said.
   And Thomas's $70 million cash bid allowed him to walk away from
the deal for up to 30 days, a violation of Reynolds's conditions.
Thomas, a 50-year-old real estate magnate from Vancouver, makes his
bids through the Samoth Capital Corp., which he controls.
   Reynolds said he'd decided to ``turn all of them down and to
start from scratch.''
   Both Mernick and Thomas were at the courthouse Thursday and said
afterward that they would consider their alternatives before
deciding whether to continue bidding.
   Bidding will begin at $50 million to $60 million, PTL trustee
M.C. ``Red'' Benton said. The bidding will follow Reynolds'
conditions, which forbid contracts allowing buyers to walk away from
the deal within a specified period of time and require a 5 percent
down payment, among other things.
   Benton said he expected one to two additional bidders, based on
the interest in the property.
   PTL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 1987,
three months after Jim Bakker stepped aside after admitting having a
sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Under Chapter 11, the Heritage USA theme park and hotel,
television network and other facilities are allowed to operate
without the threat of creditors' lawsuits until a plan is developed
to put the finances in order. The sale proceeds would be applied to
the ministry's debts, which could reach $130 million.

   After 110 years, Hastings College of Law
students have picked their first school mascot _ one often
associated with their chosen profession.
   About 60 percent of the students taking part in a campus election
voted for ``Sharks'' as their moniker, rejecting such tamer choices
as ``Legal Beagles.''
   Daniel Torrance, a third-year student who ran the election, said
this week that his group is working on an emblem for mugs and
T-shirts showing a shark in a three-piece suit.
   Torrance plans to present the nickname to the dean's office for
official recognition. But he's not entirely satisfied.
   ``I would have rather been known as `the Pit Bulls,''' he said,
``but that's democracy for you.''

   To move the library's 150,000 books to a
recently completed building, Rome officials are hoping to form a
human chain Saturday covering the 500 feet between the old and new
structures.
   The plan is to pass the books from hand to hand until they reach
the new library.
   ``I see this as an old-fashion barn-raising type of event,'' said
Libby Collins, director of the Rome-Floyd County Public Library.
``We need as many volunteers as we can get, 1,000 or even 2,000. If
we have more than enough for one line of people to move the books,
we'll form two lines.''
   She estimated it may take three weekends to move all the books,
even with so many helpers.
   Children are invited to help, Ms. Collins said.
   ``We'll be passing two or three books at a time, so children
won't be overwhelmed. And we won't be passing boxes of books, so no
volunteer will have an aching back afterward.''

<HEAD>Anesthesia Safer Than Public Thinks, Study Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anesthesia has become ``remarkably safe'' despite
bad publicity and big malpractice awards, researchers reported today.
   The patient's age and condition and the difficulty of the
operation are the determining factors in patient deaths, said the
study in the Journal of American Medical Association.
   The study analyzed deaths occurring within seven days of a
particular operation among some 100,000 patients administered
anesthesia during surgery at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg,
Canada, between 1975 and 1984.
   Studies 10 years ago showed the mortality rate directly
associated with anesthesia to be 1 in 10,000 cases, said Dr. Peter
G. Duncan, chairman of the Department of Anesthesia at the
University of Saskatchewan in Canada.
   The death rate due to anesthesia was 1 in 185,000 in a recent
British study. The study at the Winnipeg hospital indicated that
anesthesia was ``virtually immeasurable'' as a cause of death.
   ``Anesthesia has become remarkably safe and the sensationalized
major events that one reads about in the newspaper ... are very much
the exception rather than the rule,'' said Duncan, co-author of the
study.
   Errors by anesthesiologists, such as failure to maintain
patients' oxygen supply, can result in severe brain damage or death.
Skyrocketing damage awards and malpractice insurance premiums
resulting from such cases have hit anesthesiologists hard.
   ``Anesthesia doesn't add to the risk over and above that of the
surgery itself and the extent of the medical problem the patient
already has,'' said Dr. Marsha Cohen of the University of Manitoba's
Departments of Anesthesia and Community Health Sciences, co-author
of the study.
   Dr. Frederick Cheney, chairman of the Committee on Professional
Liability of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, said the
study would be welcomed by practitioners.
   ``Anesthesia has a real potential for disaster,'' Cheney said,
``but it's kind of like airplane crashes: it's very real when it
happens but millions of patients are anesthetized with no problem.''

<TEXT>
   Sunni Moslem militiamen and PLO guerrillas
searched this port city today for signs of a Swiss delegate of the
International Committee of the Red Cross who was kidnapped a day
earlier by gunmen.
   Joint patrols combed the huge Ein El-Hilweh refugee camp and
nearby orange and banana groves on Sidon's southern outskirts amid
heavy donwpours for clues on the whereabouts of Peter Winkler.
   ``We've contacted everybody, all Palestinian and Lebanese groups
in Sidon, and so far there has been no word on Winkler,'' said
Winkler's Red Cross collegue, Gerard Bise. No group has claimed
responsibility for the abduction.
   However, police and the Popular Nasserite Organization that has
governed Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war said
they believe he was kidnapped for a trade-off with Hussein Hariri, a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem aircraft hijacker held in Switzerland since
last year.
   Hariri, 22, a member of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, is accused
of hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner that was flying from Rome to
Paris and forcing it to land at Geneva on July 24, 1987. He also is
accused of killing a French passenger before he was overpowered and
arrested.
   No trial date has been set in Geneva.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, is an umbrella
group for pro-Iranian extremist factions holding most of the 14
foreign hostages, including nine Americans, in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   A police spokesman theorized the Fatah-Revolutionary Council
faction of Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal kidnapped
Winkler ``on behalf of Hezbollah.''
   ``The two groups have long been allied. Hezbollah is believed to
have requested Abu Nidal's people to kidnap the Swiss for a possible
exchange for Hariri because Hezbollah does not maintain any presence
in the Sidon region,'' the spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   About 80,000 Palestinians reside in the predominantly Sunni Sidon
region, mainly in Ein El-Hilweh and the nearby Mieh Mieh refugee
camp. Previous attempts to find kidnap victims in south Lebanon have
not always succeeded.

   Lawyers for 15 Mariel detainees sought last-minute
delays today and members of the Cuban exile community appealed to
President Reagan to block a Justice Department plan to send the
prisoners back to Cuba.
   ``In the waning days of the Reagan presidency, we are making an
appeal to the president not to leave as one of his legacies the
commencement of the deportation process of Cuban exiles to Fidel
Castro's hands,'' said Rafael Penalver, head of a task force aimed
at protecting detainees.
   The prisoners have completed their sentences and are being
deported only because they arrived in the Mariel boatlift in 1980,
Penalver said.
   But George Calhoun, director of the Justice Department's Mariel
review program, said the 15 prisoners have been convicted in the
United States of crimes ranging from murder and armed robbery to
arson and rape, and can legally be deported as undesirable aliens.
   The detainees were among 125,000 people who came to the United
States in the 1980 boatlift, and most have become law-abiding U.S.
residents. Many were criminals and mentally ill people released by
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   The Justice Department said Thursday it would wait at least 72
hours before deporting the detainees, who are being held in strict
lockdown in a prison in Talladega, Ala. They will be flown to Cuba
``in the fairly near future,'' Calhoun said.
   Attorneys said they would file a lawsuit today in federal court
in Birmingham, Ala., charging that the deportations would violate
U.S. guarantees of due process under the law.
   The task force, organized by Miami's Roman Catholic Auxiliary
Bishop Agustin Roman, met to plan further action to stop the
deportations.
   Roman and Penalver were credited with negotiating an end to the
federal prison riots a year ago in Atlanta and Oakdale, La. The
rioting began after announcement of a U.S. agreement with Fidel
Castro to resume deportations.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has paroled about
2,400 of 3,822 detainees held at that time. About 400 others have
been approved for parole and are awaiting release, said INS
spokesman Duke Austin. Those denied parole received a special review.
   Cary Copeland, a deputy associate attorney general, said the
department is reviewing the cases of about 500 more federal Mariel
detainees, and several hundred more serving sentences in state and
local jails will receive reviews.

   George Bush's right-hand man for the last four
years, Craig Fuller, said today that John Sununu's selection as
presidential chief of staff _ and not his _ shows Bush wants to
``bring in new people and energize the system.''
   Fuller, interviewed on the ``CBS Morning News,'' said he's not
upset that Bush passed him over in favor of Sununu, the governor of
New Hampshire.
   Asked if felt any sense of betrayal, Fuller replied ``none
whatsoever'' and added that Bush had ``chosen a fine man to head his
staff.''
   Fuller, the vice president's chief of staff for the last four
years, noted that Bush had said he wanted to ``bring a new team into
Washington'' and added:
   ``The selection of John Sununu shows that that commitment starts
right with the man standing next to him in the White House in the
chief of staff job. I think it is a time to bring new people in and
energize the system and let some of us who have been there
particularly for eight years go out and help in other ways and do
other things.''
   On Thursday, Fuller, the co-director of Bush's transition office,
called The Associated Press before Sununu's appointment was
announced to reveal that having been passed over for chief of staff,
he would quit working for Bush as of Jan. 20.
   Fuller said he informed Bush before the election that the only
post he would accept in the new administration was chief of staff.
   This morning, Fuller said that key jobs in the new administration
``are somehow viewed as contests and that's really not the way
George Bush made this selection.''
   ``I talked with the vice president in October during the campaign
and said that I thought he was going to be elected and if he was,
I'd really like to return to the private sector,'' Fuller said.
   ``I worked hard because I wanted to see George Bush elected,''
Fuller said. ``I got that, and I'm ready to move on to the next
phase of Craig Fuller's life.''
   Asked at a Thursday afternoon news conference whether he would
try to dissuade Fuller from leaving, Bush said, ``I'd like to
because I have such a high regard for him.''
   For his part, Sununu said he hopes Bush can ``succeed in twisting
(Fuller's) arm between now and inauguration day and keeping Craig in
a position of responsibility.''
   Fuller, 37, who succeeded Adm. Daniel Murphy as Bush's chief of
staff in February 1985, said earlier that he had told Bush he
``would be eager'' to the serve Bush in the same capacity if Bush
were elected.
   On Election Day, Fuller said, Bush ``indicated to me that he
wanted Sununu, and that if my wishes were to return to the private
sector, he'd understand. I said that I would think about it. ... He
knew I would be willing to do it (serve as chief of staff) if he
wanted me to do it.''
   Fuller said he was not interested in any job other than chief of
staff, and since he did not get it, ``I decided it was a good break
time after eight years. I got what I wanted, and that was George
Bush getting elected.''
   Fuller said he was upset with widespread news reports in recent
days, which said he had been jockeying with Sununu, 49, for the top
job, since he had promised the vice president he would remain quiet
about Bush's decision until Sununu's appointment was announced.
   With Thursday's announcement, Fuller said, he no longer felt
obliged to stay quiet.
   Fuller said he thought Sununu would ``do a good job,'' and said
``there's not a trace of bitterness at all. John Sununu is a good
friend ... and he's going to get every ounce of support from me.''
   Fuller, whose wife, Karen, is a White House secretary, said he
had no plans beyond Jan. 20, when Bush will be sworn in as
president, except to say the couple will take a trip to Africa in
March.
   Before coming to Washington as a member of President Reagan's
White House staff in January 1981, Fuller had been a vice president
and corporate secretary of Deaver & Hannaford Inc., a Los
Angeles-based public affairs consulting firm.

<TEXT>
   The unsolved slayings of a young family a year
ago today have left townspeople leery not only of strangers but of
each other.
   ``It's unbelievable that it could be somebody walking the streets
and you might know him,'' said Joan Sneed, owner of the Ina Cafe in
this town of 450.
   On Nov. 18, 1987, a sheriff's deputy found the badly beaten
bodies of Ruby Elaine Dardeen, 30; her son, Peter Sean, 3, and the
girl she gave birth to during the attack with a baseball bat in
their mobile home.
   The baby, later named Casey Elaine by her grandparents, was born
alive and killed with blows to the head, authorities said. Mrs.
Dardeen had been 7{ months' pregnant.
   The body of Russell Keith Dardeen, the 29-year-old husband and
father, was found by hunters the next day. He had been shot three
times in the head, police said.
   Townspeople this week said residents no longer are as trusting as
they were before the slayings. Previously, doors went unlocked at
night.
   Despite 822 interviews that have led investigators all over the
country, a $10,000 reward from the Dardeen family and a stream of
leads, the case remains unsolved.
   ``Any closer to a suspect or an arrest? No,'' said Jefferson
County sheriff's Capt. Mike Anthis, who heads the investigation.
``We don't see that around the corner.
   ``It's one of those situations it could be tomorrow, next week,
next month _ you don't know. It may be another year from now. It's
kind of like working a 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.''
   Police have no motive, said Anthis, who acknowledged that the
longer the case goes unsolved, the more difficult solution becomes.
   Rick Hobler, the attorney for the Dardeen estate, said relatives
were frustrated about the lack of a break in the case but remain
hopeful.
   ``The families are religious families and they both believe that
their prayers will be answered,'' Hobler said. ``They're convinced
that something that's right will happen.'' Both families chose to
speak through Hobler.
   The slayings are no longer the primary topic of conversation at
the four-table Ina Cafe, said Mrs. Sneed, but ``it's always in the
back of everybody's mind. Who did it? And why?''

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Doubts Deficit Fueling Currency Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said today he
does not believe that concern over the U.S. deficit has caused the
fall in the value of the dollar or the declines on stock markets
since George Bush was elected president.
   Brady also said he does not expect interest rates to rise.
   ``Markets go up and down,'' Brady said on NBC-TV's ``Today''
show. ``The currency markets, which are down in the last six weeks,
are really at the same levels they were in January of last year. I
don't really worry about it very much.''
   Asked if the declines indicate a lack of confidence in Bush's
ability to overcome the deficit, Brady said, ``I just disagree. The
Bush deficit-reduction plan, which is called a flexible freeze, will
work. I think we have to give the vice president a little time to
put his team together.''
   ``I'm confident that things will work out just fine,'' said
Brady, who will continue as treasury secretary when Bush takes
office Jan. 20.
   But New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, whom Bush has appointed his
presidential chief of staff, said in another interview that there is
``a little bit of nervousness out there.''
   Seeking to reassure the financial community, he added, ``I think
the world can feel comfortable that George Bush knows that strong
leadership in dealing with the deficit is the first priority of this
administration.''
   He was interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   Intervention by central banks pushed the dollar up early today in
Europe and Japan, after the dollar closed at a 15-year low against
the Japanese yen on Thursday. U.S. stock markets have fallen more
than 75 points since Bush was elected 10 days ago.
   Brady, said he sees no need for Bush to take action before his
Jan. 20 inauguration to allay the concerns of financial and currency
markets.
   ``I don't think the concern is that big a problem,'' he said,
adding that Bush would work with Congress to combat the deficit.
``I'm confident things will be worked out.''
   ``I don't see anything in the figures right now that would
indicate interest rates are going to rise,'' he said, noting low
unemployment, high economic production and continued economic
expansion.
   Brady said that although Bush has promised not to raise taxes, he
will find ways to cut the deficit.
   ``I think when the vice president gets into office ... you'll
hear from him very directly what he wants to do,'' he said.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley of Washington, also
interviewed by NBC, pledged support for the new administration in
dealing with the economy.
   ``It's fair to give the vice president a chance to appoint his
key financial advisers and budget director .... before there is any
discussion with Congress,'' he said. But he said Congress would like
to see a general outline of Bush's plan for approaching the budget.
   ``We're not going to initiate any revenues if the vice president
is going to oppose them,'' Foley said. ``There no danger that the
Democratic Congress is going to go knocking on President Bush's door
insisting on taxes. It's going to have to come from him.''
   Sununu said he expects that in the next few days Bush will
communicate directly with the congressional leadership ``to begin
the kind of interaction that necessary.
   ``I think Congress and the president are going to work
aggressively and quickly to deal with that issue.''

President-elect George Bush's preparations for taking over as chief
executive:
   _Bush flew this morning to Charlottesville, Va., for private
meetings with some of the nation's governors. He was to return for
lunch on Capitol Hill with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   _On Thursday, Bush had a breakfast meeting with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and lunch with President Reagan. He also
had a chat with former Texas Sen. John Tower, who is rumored to be a
leading candidate for secretary of defense.
   _Among other names mentioned as possible candidates for top Bush
administration posts: Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, to head
Housing and Urban Development; Donald Rumsfeld, for defense
secretary, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp, for labor secretary.
   _Bush endorsed Lee Atwater, his wily campaign manager, as the
next chairman of the Republican Party.
   _There was unusual turmoil in the Bush ranks when the
president-elect announced his selection of New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu as chief of staff. Craig L. Fuller, Bush's vice presidential
chief of staff for four years and co-director of the transition,
announced that, having been passed over for the White House chief of
staff job, he would quit working for Bush as of Inauguration Day,
Jan. 20.
   _Bush's office confirmed that he plans to hold a get-acquainted
meeting Tuesday in Houston with Mexico's president-elect, Carlos
Salinas, who assumes office Dec. 1.
   _Bush said the Central Intelligence Agency in his administration
``will clearly be an intelligence agency. It will have no function
in policy at all,'' except to carry out certain covert actions.

   Pop diva Madonna, who got mostly poor reviews for
her Broadway debut in David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,'' says there's
an album in her future but she hasn't given up on acting.
   ``I'm just letting my creative juices take me where they will,''
she said in an interview in December's Fame magazine.
   ``There aren't a lot of great movies to do, so that just works
out fine for me because I haven't done a record in at least two
years,'' she said.
   ``I'm going into the studio to record some stuff that's really
different. As long as I can write songs, I'll make records. When I
get tired of that, when it gets old or I don't have anything to say,
then I won't do it.''
   Madonna said the poor reviews of her acting do not discourage her
because she withstood the same criticism when she started her
singing career.
   ``In the beginning they thought that I was the flavor of the
month. A one-act Disco Dolly who was just going to pop in and pop
out,'' she said.
   ``They slandered me for the first two albums. Finally, on my last
album, they said, OK, she's talented. All right, she can write a
good song. Now I'm going through the same thing with acting and
movies.''

   Palestinian guerrillas today attacked an
Israeli army post in south Lebanon with rockets and automatic fire,
and a security source said one guerrilla was wounded.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a ``fierce
battle'' started at midday between the attackers and Israeli
soldiers manning the outpost in the hamlet of Kfarshouba near the
western slopes of Mt. Hermon.
   The source said that at least three guerrillas took part in the
attack. It was not immediately known to which faction they belonged.
   The outpost commands the northern edge of Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon and overlooks the
terrain policed by the United Nations peacekeeping force, the source
said.
   ``Around 50 Israeli soldiers are searching the area for the
attackers,'' the source said. He gave no further details.
   Israel retained control of the 6-to-10-mile wide strip when it
withdrew the bulk of its occupation army from south Lebanon in
summer 1985. The zone serves as a buffer against guerrilla attacks
against northern Israeli settlements.
   The 5,800-strong U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, drawn from nine
countries, patrols terrain north of the security zone.

   Workers laid off from Gov. Michael Dukakis'
campaign for president can turn to his administration's employment
program for help in finding new jobs. Unemployed George Bush workers
are welcome, too.
   State officials said it may be the first time the job program has
moved to help laid-off campaign workers.
   A total of 250 people lost their jobs at the Democratic campaign
headquarters.
   ``This is standard procedure,'' said Michelle Andrews, director
of communications for the state Employment and Training office.
``It's something we try to do whenever there's a sizeable layoff.''
   Officials plan to meet Tuesday with campaign workers to provide
job counseling, information on unemployment insurance benefits and
help in finding another job.
   ``That's incredible,'' said state House Minority Leader Steven
Pierce, a Republican. ``I thought they'd just go back to their state
jobs.'' He wanted to know if the same service would be offered to
workers laid off at Bush's Massachusetts headquarters.
   ``It's an interesting idea,'' Ms. Andrews said. ``But, yes,
certainly it's something we'd be glad to help out with.''
   Some Dukakis workers could be headed for state jobs. The posts of
chief of staff and secretary of administration and finance will be
open soon.
   But Kim Manolius, who is handling administration and finance
duties at the Dukakis campaign, said he doubted many campaign
workers would get state jobs.
   ``My understanding is there's a hiring freeze on,'' he said.

   Politicians today condemned an attack
by South Koreans on a U.S. military housing complex and called on
police to step up security around military housing areas.
   Forty young people wielding clubs and iron pipes and throwing
firebombs attacked the military family housing compound Thursday
night, wounding two U.S. servicemen and damaging or destroying nine
military vehicles and passenger cars, authorities said. The
attackers fled when riot police arrived, and there were no immediate
arrests, they said.
   Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, issued
a statement today calling the attackers ``thugs'' and ``cowardly
criminals'' and said manpower would be increased at the housing
complex and additional security precautions taken immediately.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment has been rising in South Korea in recent
months, and radical students have demanded the ouster of the 42,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Witnesses said the attackers, yelling ``Yankees Go Home'' and
``Drive Out American Imperialists,'' overwhelmed three guards and
stormed the back gate of the Hannam Village complex, one mile from
the 8th U.S. Army headquarters near central Seoul.
   The first serviceman injured was a military policeman on duty.
Witnesses said about 10 young people grabbed him, dragged him behind
the guard house and wrestled him to the ground, beating him with
clubs. Two South Korean guards were shoved out of the way, they said.
   A U.S. Army statement said the second U.S. serviceman was injured
when a pipe thrown at his car shattered the windshield as he was
leaving the compound.
   The names of the two victims were not released.
   A military spokesman said no dependents of service personnel were
injured, but that more than $15,000 in damage was caused.
   The complex, which houses about 2,500 family members of United
States service personnel, was attacked twice in October by radical
students who tore down the American flag and burned it.
   Suh Chung-won, spokesman for the opposition Reunification
Democratic Party, and Kim Joong-wie, spokesman for the governing
Democratic Justice Party, both condemned the raid. Kim said the
government was asking police to take measures to prevent a
recurrence.
   The Seoul office of Pacific Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military
newspaper, said it had been besieged by telephone calls from angry,
frightened residents of the residential complex demanding more
security.

   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President-elect
Dan Quayle, today removed herself from the list of possible
candidates to fill her husband's U.S. Senate seat.
   In a statement released by the vice president-elect's transition
office, Mrs. Quayle said she had told Indiana Gov. Robert Orr that
she is not interested in succeeding her husband.
   Quayle, who was elected to the vice presidency Nov. 8, announced
Monday that he would step down as Indiana's senator prior to Jan. 3
to give Republican incumbent Orr _ rather than incoming Democrat
Evan Bayh _ the opportunity to appoint a successor.
   Mrs. Quayle, a lawyer, was among the names mentioned as a
possible replacement.
   ``I appreciate the confidence and support I've received from so
many people in Indiana and around the country,'' Mrs. Quayle said in
the statement. ``However, I have informed Governor (Robert) Orr that
I am not interested in being appointed to fill my husband's seat in
the U.S. Senate.''
   Orr met with Mrs. Quayle on Thursday in Washington. She
emphasized that her responsibilities as the wife of the vice
president and the mother of three school-age children would not
allow her enough time for the Senate job, said Jim Carroll, a
spokesman with the transition office.
   Mrs. Quayle is the second person this week to withdraw from the
list of possible candidates. Mitch Daniels, an Indianapolis lawyer
who served in the Reagan administration, said Wednesday he informed
Orr that he was not interested in the job.
   Daniels was assistant to the president for political and
governmental affairs until his resignation Jan. 31, 1987.
   Other candidates mentioned for the post are Indiana's Lt. Gov.
John M. Mutz, who failed in his bid to succeed Orr, and U.S. Reps.
Dan Coats and Dan Burton, both Republicans.

   Three former Rhodesian security force men
were sentenced to hang today after being convicted on murder charges
stemming from a bomb attack on a house owned by the main guerrilla
group fighting South Africa.
   The death sentences for the three _ Kevin Woods, 35, a former
member of the security police, Michael Smith, 34, a one-time soldier
in the Rhodesian light infantry, and Phillip Conjwayo, 54, formerly
with the Rhodesian police special branch _ will automatically be
appealed.
   Judge president Wilson Sandura found the trio not guilty of
alternative lesser charges of terrorism or sabotage.
   The state accused the three men of setting off a car bomb with a
remote control device outside a house owned by the African National
Congress in Bulawayo on Jan. 12, killing an unemployed Zambian who
helped with the attack.
   There were no other casualties in the attack, which the state
said was ordered by South African intelligence officers.
   The African National Congress has several houses and offices in
Zimbabwe. The Harare government denies the ANC also has military
bases in Zimbabwe. The group's targets have frequently been bombed
or attacked by troops, allegedly from South Africa, since Zimbabwe's
independence from Britain in 1980.
   Woods and Smith, whites who fought black nationalist guerrillas
in the seven-year war that transformed white-governed Rhodesia into
black-ruled Zimbabwe, described the ANC as a terrorist organization.
   During the trial, state witnesses claimed coded messages were
exchanged between Pretoria and Woods through portable computers.
   The state alleged that Woods, Smith and a third man were behind
two other bomb attacks on ANC targets in Harare in 1986. They will
be tried separately on those charges, which also carry the death
penalty.

   President-elect George Bush, after
picking a ``take-charge kind of guy'' as his chief of staff, said
today he intends fill out his economic team and then turn to
national security posts.
   Bush, here for a private meeting with several governors, told
reporters he planned to ``flesh out the economic side of the house,
I think, and then start working on national security.''
   Asked if that meant he was preparing to name Richard Darman, his
longtime economic aide, as director of the Office of Management and
Budget, Bush laughed but said nothing.
   After the morning meeting, Bush was flying back to Washington for
a Capitol Hill lunch with the speaker of the House, Jim Wright.
   As the day began, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, publicly picked
by Bush Thursday as his next chief of staff, told a television
interviewer that the president-elect would communicate directly with
Congress ``to begin the kind of interaction that's necessary'' to
address the federal budget deficit.
   ``I think Congress and the president are going to work
aggressively and quickly to deal with that issue,'' Sununu said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   Bush said his meeting with 18 governors and governors-elect was
intended ``to send an early signal to the governors and the states
of my interests in working with the governors, Democrats and
Republicans alike.''
   He also said he wants to meet with the governors early to discuss
the environment and education.
   There was unusual turmoil in the Bush ranks Thursday when the
presient-elect announced his selection of Sununu as chief of staff
and endorsed Lee Atwater, his wily campaign manager, as the next
chairman of the Republican Party.
   Craig L. Fuller, Bush's vice presidential chief of staff for four
years and co-director of the transition, called The Associated Press
beforehand to reveal that having been passed over for chief of
staff, he would quit working for Bush as of Jan. 20.
   Fuller said he informed Bush before the election that the only
post he would accept in the new administration was chief of staff.
He said he harbored no ill will toward Sununu.
   Sources close to Bush said Fuller had been offered several plums,
including transportation secretary and head of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, but had turned them down.
   In choosing the conservative, blunt-spoken Sununu and Atwater, a
bare-knuckled campaign strategist, Bush may have been indicating to
Democrats who control Congress that he is prepared to play political
hardball.
   But he sounded a different note at his news conference, saying he
expects Sununu ``to build a constructive relationship'' with
Congress. He also called Sununu ``a take-charge kind of guy'' with
the experience to work with his former colleagues in the statehouses.
   Bush, who previously announced his choice of James A. Baker III
as secretary of state and Nicholas F. Brady as a holdover treasury
secretary, said he expects to announce a director for the Office of
Management and Budget soon.
   Transition sources have said that post is likely to go to Darman,
while Stanford University economist Michael J. Boskin is likely to
be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
   Bush has had to contend with a succession of economic bad news
since his election. The stock market has fallen and the dollar has
declined in value, with many analysts questioning Bush's ability or
resolve to cut the nation's massive trade and budget deficits.
   Bush aides hope fast action in naming his economic team will
bolster confidence in the president-elect.
   Brady, asked on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show if the behavior of stock
prices and the dollar's value indicate a lack of confidence in
Bush's ability to overcome the deficit, replied, ``I just disagree.
   ``The Bush deficit-reduction plan, which is called a flexible
freeze, will work. I think we have to give the vice president a
little time to put his team together. I'm confident that things will
work out just fine.''
   But Sununu, in his interview, said he feels that there is ``a
little bit of nervousness out there.''
   Bush said the OMB job ``is important and I want to get our
economic team in place. ... Most people would agree we've moved very
fast so far. But I will go forward with the economic team.''
   Bush, who had a breakfast meeting Thursday with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and lunch with President Reagan, also
held a private chat with former Texas Sen. John Tower, who is
rumored to be a leading candidate for secretary of defense.
   Bush defended Sununu, an Arab-American, for his refusal to sign a
proclamation two years ago condemning a 1975 United Nations
resolution that equated Zionism with racism. Sununu was the only
governor to balk at signing such a proclamation.
   Bush said Sununu was ``well within his prerogative'' to not want
to meddle in foreign policy as a governor. ``Everybody knows my
position on it, that I think that (U.N.) resolution is outrageous''
and should be repealed, Bush said. He also pointed to Sununu's role
in drafting the 1988 Republican platform, which called for a
rescission of that U.N. Resolution 3379.
   Sununu told reporters, ``I have no problem saying that that
(resolution) ought to be repudiated.''
   Sununu, 49, is an engineer by training and a former Tufts
University professor, with no previous experience in Washington.
Asked about his reputation for having a short fuse, Sununu joked,
``I'm a pussycat.''
   He said his main task will be to serve as ``an honest broker''
and present Bush with ``as much information'' as possible about the
decisions he must make.
   Sununu said today that ``if I can blend into the woodwork while
(Bush) gets the visibility, that's the way it should be done.''
   Bush said Atwater's job will be ``winning elections'' for the GOP.
   ``He's No. 1 and he knows the party apparatus from top to
bottom,'' said Bush. Atwater, 37, is certain to get the job Jan. 18
when the Republican National Committee meets to choose a successor
to Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who is stepping down after six years.

<TEXT>
   Donna Rice, the Miami model whose association
with Gary Hart ended his 1988 presidential campaign, canceled an
appearance before a group of journalists today after spotting
cameras waiting for her.
   Ms. Rice said in a handwritten statement moments before her
slated appearance that she had expected her meeting with the Society
of Professional Journalists-Sigma Delta Chi to be private and
off-the-record.
   ``As you are probably aware, for the past year and a half, I have
purposely avoided capitalizing on my notoriety, and except for three
specific interviews, I have declined all media offers,'' she said in
the statement.
   ``When the society's invitation was received, I felt that today
might be an opportunity to quietly and candidly share with you some
of my experiences and observations.
   ``However, it was my original understanding that this panel
discussion was private, and essentially off the record. But when I
arrived a few minutes ago and I saw the cameras, lights and tape
recorders, I realized this wasn't the forum I anticipated.''
   James Plante, national president of SPJ-SDX, said he believed
that Ms. Rice knew her appearance at the Albert B. Sabin Cincinnati
Convention Center would be on the record.
   Plante, an administrator with NBC News in New York, said SPJ-SDX
general counsel Bruce Sanford, who arranged Ms. Rice's appearance
about three weeks ago, had assured Plante that the session would be
on the record.
   ``She was uncomfortable about the cameras,'' said Plante, who
spoke with Ms. Rice moments before her decision to avoid the session.
   ``She wanted to share her ideas about what's happened in her life
with the group privately, but she didn't want to do it in front of
the cameras.''

   Populist leader Benazir Bhutto today
claimed the support of a majority of newly elected National Assembly
members and predicted no obstacles in her attempt to become the
first woman to lead a Moslem nation.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, told reporters her party commanded a majority
from Wednesday's elections because some new assembly members have
joined her Pakistan People's Party party since then and others have
pledged their support.
   However, she refused to say how many new assembly members now
belonged to her party or to give further details.
   Her Pakistan People's Party captured 92 seats in the 237-member
assembly in the first free elections in Pakistan since 1977. Her
rivals in the nine-party conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance,
which includes supporters of the late President Gen. Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq, won 54 seats.
   Independents and minor parties won 58 seats. Results from 13
districts were not available, and 20 seats reserved for women will
be filled later by vote of the assembly.
   Ms. Bhutto also offered to make peace with political opponents.
   ``Despite our simple majority we are prepared to expand our base
of cooperation with other parties if they take the initiative,'' she
told reporters at her walled compound in Karachi.
   The constitution requires the president to designate a person to
form a government, and Ms. Bhutto on Thursday urged President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan to give her party the mandate.
   When asked by a reporter if she foresaw any problems in becoming
prime minister, she replied: ``I don't see any obstacle.''
   As prime minister, the U.S.-educated Ms. Bhutto would be
recapturing the post lost by her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, when
he was ousted in a coup led by Zia in 1977. Bhutto was convicted of
complicity in a political murder plot and hanged in 1979.
   Zia ruled by martial law for eight years after the coup, then
held national elections in 1985 in which candidates were not allowed
to be affiliated with political parties.
   The general dismissed the government and National Assembly in May
on grounds of corruption, incompetence and delay in putting Pakistan
under Islamic law. Zia called Wednesday's election before the plane
crash Aug. 17 in which he, the U.S. ambassador and 28 other people
were killed. A government inquiry blamed the crash on sabotage.
   Both Ms. Bhutto and the conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance
have said they would continue Pakistan's friendship with the United
States and support of Moslem guerrillas fighting the communist
government of neighboring Afghanistan.
   Ms. Bhutto also has said she will pursue Zia's program of
increasing the influence of Islam in the nation's life, but she
pledged not to let the religious policy interfere with the rights of
women and minorities.
   In a statement released Thursday by her representatives in
Washington, she said she looked forward to working with the U.S.
government ``to build and further strengthen the special
relationship that exists.'' The United States has a $4.02 billion
six-year program of military aid for Pakistan.
   Pakistan also has provided sanctuary for millions of Afghan
refugees who fled their country after the 1979 Soviet military
intervention and is a channel for supplies to the U.S.-backed Afghan
guerrillas.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said:
``We congratulate the Pakistani people and their leaders for this
impressive and important step in strengthening democracy in
Pakistan.''

   Central banks intervened in foreign exchange
markets today and purchased large amounts of dollars for the second
straight day in an attempt to stabilize the U.S. currency's sagging
value.
   Money brokers said the Federal Reserve, West German Bundesbank
and other central banks of major U.S. trading partners were
aggressively buying dollars with yen, marks and other key currencies.
   ``It's the same cast of characters similar to yesterday's
intervention,'' said Robert Hatcher, a foreign exchange trader at
the New York branch of Britain's Barclays Bank.
   ``For the central banks, it's a case now of wearing down the
market's inclination to sell dollars,'' Hatcher said. ``The first
step of course is to get the dollar to stop falling. The second step
is getting people interested in buying dollars. That's going to take
awhile.''
   Others said the dollar may have been helped by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady, who told NBC's ``Today Show'' he's not concerned
with the currency market gyrations and does not attribute the
dollar's trouble to fear that President-elect George Bush won't
solve the U.S. trade and budget deficits.
   After falling to record or near-record levels following Bush's
election last week, the dollar was mostly higher Thursday on a wave
of central bank intervention. It rose again this morning from 121.52
yen in Tokyo to 122.15 yen, and strengthened further in London and
New York to the 123-yen level.
   Against the West German mark, the dollar was largely unchanged at
the 1.7430 level and was slightly lower against the British pound at
about $1.81.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.50 a troy ounce,
down from $422 late Thursday. Gold was also down in Zurich and Hong
Kong.
   Despite its relative stability this morning, economists said the
dollar will need much more than central-bank intervention for its
long-term health, and some predicted the foreign exchange markets
would soon push the dollar lower again.
   Intervention is the direct buying or selling of currencies by
central banks. If the purchases are large enough, they can influence
prices directly. When the Fed, or the Bank of Japan, or the West
German Bundesbank, buys dollars directly, that reduces the supply of
dollars available and sends up the price.
   Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities
Co. International, said traders here and abroad still are concerned
that Bush and the Democratic-controlled Congress will be unable to
work together to narrow the huge gaps in trade and the federal
budget, and if left unchecked both factors could hurt the economy.
   ``Each side appears wedded to their own views and they will be
unable to compromise until they've substantially ground each other
up,'' he said.
   The dollar's rebound lent some support to the stock market
Thursday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed up
14.05 points at 2,052.63.
   But bond prices slipped. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond
finished lower by about $5 per $1,000 in face value, with its yield
rising to 9.15 percent from late Wednesday's 9.11 percent. Some
analysts blamed the decline on the Treasury's auction of $9.03
billion in new 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   The financial markets worry that a weak dollar could drive up
interest rates and spark higher inflation _ which in turn depresses
bond prices _ because it would raise prices of imports and some
domestic commodities.

   President-elect George Bush met 18
governors and governors-elect today because, he said, ``I wanted to
send an early signal to the governors and the states of my interests
in working with the governors, Democrats and Republicans alike.''
   He called the session both ``productive'' and also ``symbolic.''
   Bush, meeting briefly with reporters after the morning meeting,
said he hoped that rather than having the federal government mandate
programs that require state spending ``I'd like to have it the other
way around'' with the federal government responsive to the state
needs.
   He also said that his selection of retiring New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu as chief of staff ``sends that same signal of my
interest in having strong input from the governors.''
   The president-elect said he wants to meet with the governors
early and address the issues of environment and education.
   Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, host of the conference, said the
governors had had a ``full, friendly and free discussion'' with Bush
on issues that included the deficit.
   ``The vice president asked for the governors' help and he'll get
it,'' Baliles said.

   A nationwide search for four young adults
ended with the recovery of bodies from a car in a river, but
questions remain whether the accident was a deadly combination of
illegal drinking, missing safety barriers and a misdirected detour
sign.
   A car containing what authorities believed were the bodies of the
four young people was found Thursday in 15 feet of water on the
bottom of the murky Mill River near New Haven harbor.
   Authorities were awaiting autopsy results to make positive
identifications, but city police Lt. James Sorrentino said it was
likely the four victims were the missing friends, who graduated
together from East Lyme High School in 1987.
   The three women and one man were last seen by their parents about
7 p.m. Saturday, when they left their hometown of East Lyme for a
night in New Haven.
   The four were Jill Sawyer, 19, a student at the University of
Rhode Island; Christy Stevens, 19, a student at Mohegan Community
College in Norwich; Michael Gallo, 20, a student at Southern
Connecticut State University; and Laura Lagrotteria, 19.
   ``They were good kids. I can't picture them being drunk and
driving,'' said Michelle Funaioli, a student at Southern
Connecticut. ``It's horrible. It's the most horrible thing I've ever
seen happen.''
   Police have determined the four spent at least part of Saturday
night drinking at a bar near Yale University. State police Detective
Andre Trudelle said a bar employee told authorities that the friends
left together about 3 a.m. Sunday. The legal drinking age in
Connecticut is 21.
   Their car apparently traveled down Chapel Street, went over a
concrete barrier that was in place Thursday and plunged into the
river, Sorrentino said. The street has been a dead end for years
because the Chapel Street bridge is out of service.
   Officials said the bridge pivots open on a center axis to allow
water traffic to pass and has been in its open position for years.
   Private investigator Francis ``Bud'' Mullen, former head of the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, said he believed the
barrier was not in place at the time of the accident. Mullen was
hired by the youths' families to find them after they were reported
missing. The families also put up a $20,000 reward for helping to
locate them.
   Several news reports, quoting unidentified sources, also said no
barriers were in place the night of the accident.
   ``I have no information either way,'' Sorrentino said. ``I've
been led to believe the barriers were always there.''
   Police had decided to drag the city's rivers for the missing
adults, and the area beneath the closed bridge was the first place
searched, Sorrentino said.
   ``This was an area that we thought was a likely place for a car
to go off the road and into the water,'' he said. ``There's no other
place where there is a bridge out.''
   With several questions unanswered, including whether a sign
incorrectly directed traffic down the dead-end street to the bridge,
New Haven Mayor Biagio DiLieto told city officials to complete a
report on the accident by today.
   On Thursday, two signs leading to the bridge warned of danger
ahead. One was a small green sign restricting the road to local
traffic only. The other was an orange detour sign with an arrow that
incorrectly directs traffic to the dead end.
   The public works department referred calls to city Corporation
Counsel Brian Murphy. He was in a meeting Thursday evening and
unavailable for comment, his secretary said.
   A Thursday night prayer service for the victims, planned when
they were still missing, turned into a tearful memorial ceremony
attended by about 200 friends and relatives at a Niantic church.
   ``There are no words to take away your pain,'' said Assistant
Pastor Laurie Whinnem Etter. ``The only way to respond is to
celebrate the love and the joy that these friends shared.''
   Edward J. Jadovich, the state's acting liquor control
commissioner, said his department planned to investigate at least
two bars because of reports that the four spent Saturday night bar
hopping. He declined to identify the bars.

   A federal grand jury is investigating
allegations that a Cornell University graduate student created a
``virus'' that jammed a nationwide network of university and
military computers, a prosecutor said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter on Thursday declined to say
when the panel began hearing evidence or whether anyone has been
subpoenaed to testify.
   ``I can say this is the only district in which a grand jury
investigation is pending. Some evidence has been presented to the
grand jury,'' Baxter said.
   Cornell student Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, is suspected of
unleashing the virus earlier this month, disrupting 6,000 computers
nationwide.
   Morris has told friends he didn't intend any harm.
   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation to determine
whether statutes on wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawful
access to stored communications may have been broken. No charges
have been filed.
   The FBI has subpoenaed computer tapes and other records at
Cornell's computer science department.
   Baxter declined to say whether anyone other than Morris is the
target of the grand jury investigation in Syracuse.
   A computer virus works by duplicating itself, infecting one
computer after another as users share floppy disks or link up over
telephone lines.
   The virus this month did its damage by rapidly duplicating
itself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed and taking up
memory space.

   Lithuanians today raised the flag of the formerly
independent republic over their parliament building after lawmakers
declared it the republic's new banner and Lithuanian the official
language.
   Editors of official Lithuanian television said debate was under
way on an amendment to the Lithuanian Constitution challenging
Moscow's authority by requiring the republic's approval of any new
national law.
   A Russian newspaper accused neighboring Estonia of fostering
ethnic tension by declaring Estonian its national language earlier
this week.
   The television editors, in a telephone interview from Vilnius,
the capital, said the red, green and yellow flag was raised in a
ceremony immediately after the vote was taken.
   The parliament declared the official government language, the
flag and an old national song as the national hymn, said editor
Vitautus Makauskas of the official television, which provided a live
broadcast.
   It also protested proposed amendments to the Soviet Constitution
that residents of the three tiny Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia say will limit their autonomy, he said. He could
not give exact totals, but said there were very few dissenting votes.
   The meeting in Lithuania, and demonstrations planned later today
marking the 70th anniversary of independence in Latvia, were signs
of resurgent nationalism in the Soviet republics that are using
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms to push for greater
autonomy.
   Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were independent between the world
wars but were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 following a pact
between the Soviets and the Nazis.
   Residents of the Baltics have increasingly pushed for more
economic and cultural freedom under Gorbachev's reform policy.
Thousands in the three republics have joined People's Front
organizations, which recently have spread to the Slavic republics of
Byelorussia and the Ukraine.
   The Baltics have been angered by amendments to the national
Constitution proposed by Gorbachev, saying they would shift the
little power they have to central authorities in Moscow and
eliminate their constitutional right to secede.
   The United States backed the Baltic nationalists Thursday. State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington: ``The United
States does not recognize the forcible incorporation of the Baltic
states. ... The people of the Baltic states have been denied their
basic human rights.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, the official newspaper of the Russian
republic, today cited rising tensions between nationalities in
Estonia, picking up a theme sounded by Politburo member and former
KGB secret police chief Viktor M. Chebrikov in a visit to Estonia
last weekend.
   On Thursday, Kremlin expressed doubt about the constitutionality
of the Estonian parliament's proclamation on Wednesday that it has
the right to review any new law passed in Moscow, and its
``declaration of sovereignty'' in all areas except foreign policy
and defense.
   It called Estonian leaders to the Soviet capital for a meeting
with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest
executive body, of which Gorbachev is the chairman. Estonian leaders
said on a flight late Thursday to Moscow from Tallinn that they
expected the summons to Moscow.
   ``Perestroika is a hope and democracy is a hope, and every hope
has a moment of unease,'' the newly elected Estonian premier, Indrek
Toome, said.
   ``The dialogue has begun,'' said Igor Grazin, the Estonian lawyer
who wrote the legislation and will defend it before the Presidium.
   Chebrikov sharply criticized Estonia's Communist Party for
fueling nationalism and warned the leadership was causing tension
between the republic's ethnic groups.
   Establishment of Estonian as the official language of the
republic is on the agenda for a future meeting. Official statistics
say 61 percent of Estonia's 1.5 million people are ethnic Estonians.
About 28 percent are Russians.
   Ethnic Lithuanians make up 80 percent of the population of
Lithuania's 3.7 million people.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, presumably speaking for the ethnic Russians,
said the new language legislation was poorly worked out and that
about 100,000 people had attended meetings in Estonia protesting the
establishment of the official language as ``illegal and
anti-democratic.''

   The city's Christmas decorations have to
be thrown out because they were contaminated by potentially
cancer-causing asbestos dust, but officials today said money has
been donated for replacements.
   Wanda Bass of the First National Community Development Corp. gave
the city a check for $2,500, which will be matched by the city,
officials said.
   The decorations were stored with other city Parks Department
material in the old Navy Reserve center.
   An inspection of the building this year revealed old insulation
was releasing asbestos particles into the air. Asbestos has been
identified as a potential cancer-causing substance when inhaled.
   Mel Priddy, head of the Parks and Recreation Department, said
cleaning the lights and other Christmas decorations would require
more labor than they were worth.
   ``Several items from the same room as the decorations have been
removed and cleaned, but it would probably be a very complicated
process to clean the tinsel,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union today recognized the proclamation
of an independent Palestinian state, but stopped short of extending
full diplomatic relations.
   The Soviet action, announced at a hastily called news briefing by
First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh, appeared to be
a cautious step between Soviet support for the Palestinian cause and
its effort to improve relations with Israel.
   ``Faithful to the fundamental principle of freedom of choice, the
Soviet Union recognizes the proclamation of the Palestinian state,''
Bessmertnykh said.
   He said the Soviet Union believed a comprehensive settlement of
the Arab-Israeli conflict ``will lead also to the practical
completion of the historic process of creating this state.''
   Asked whether his announcement amounted to recognition of the
Palestinian state, Bessmertnykh said ``in essence,'' it did.
   But a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Boris Savastyanov, said later
in a telephone interview that it did not entail immediate exchange
of diplomats and full diplomatic relations.
   ``That requires additional work,'' he said, adding that he could
not speculate on when it might occur.
   The Palestine National Council, meeting in Algiers on Tuesday,
declared an independent Palestinian state. The council is the
policy-making body of the Palestine Liberation Organization and is
considered the Palestinian parliament-in-exile.
   Cyprus, East Germany and the Christian faction of Lebanon's
divided government announced recognition today of the Palestinian
state, bringing to at least 28 the number of countries to extend
diplomatic ties.
   In Lebanon, the recognition came from the Christian cabinet of
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, but there was no statement from a
rival Moslem cabinet. Lebanon has had two governments since
parliament failed to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel
when his term expired Sept. 23.
   The declaration in Algeria did not define the boundaries of the
Palestinian nation, saying it would be determined by future
negotiations. But the council accepted U.N. Resolution 242, which
implicitly recognizes Israel, along with other U.N. resolutions,
including one calling for Palestinian self-determination.
   The Soviet Union's recognition of the proclamation of the
Palestinian state comes as the Soviets continue to pursue a gradual
thaw in relations with Israel.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967
after that year's Middle East war. It has backed the PLO under
Yasser Arafat and supported Arab demands that Israel give back
occupied territory.
   But the Soviets also have tried under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to improve ties with Israel. Low-level delegations have
exchanged visits, and the Soviets have loosened some restrictions on
Jewish emigration.
   The Soviet Union praised the realism and responsibility of the
PLO session's decision to accept U.N. Resolution 242, which also
requires Israel to withdraw from territories it occupied in the 1967
war.
   It also is pressing for a Middle East peace conference including
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Such a
conference presumably would give the Soviet Union a greater say in
the Middle East.
   Cyprus became the second nation that has relations with Israel to
recognize the new Palestinian state. The PLO already has a mission
with diplomatic status in Nicosia.
   Turkey is the only other country that recognizes Israel and the
Palestinian homeland. The Israeli Foreign Ministry summoned the
Turkish charge d'affaires on Wednesday to criticize the move.
   Among the Arab countries, only Syria, Egypt and its close ally
Oman have stopped short of recognition. But Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak called his endorsement of the declaration ``stronger than
recognition.''
   States which have recognized the Palestinian state are:
Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Cyprus, East Germany,
India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nicaragua, North and South Yemen,
Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey, the United
Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia.
   In addition, the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram said that Cuba, Zambia
and Somalia also had recognized the Palestinian homeland but cited
no source for the report. Palestinian officials said Cuba and
Singapore have recognized the state, but there has been no
confirmation from officials in those governments.

   A topless dancer has been arrested in a crime
of fashion _ stealing a dress valued at $20,000 that belonged to pop
star Madonna.
   The 19-year-old woman was arrested Thursday in Myrtle Beach,
S.C., where she had been working for a few weeks, police said.
   The strapless blue number worn by the singer during the song
``True Blue'' in the movie ``Who's that Girl?'' was stolen July 15
from a display of rock memorabilia at a mall in Novi, a Detroit
suburb. Madonna is from nearby Rochester.
   Three days later, four teen-agers turned the dress in, saying
they found it. Later, two of them told officers who they thought
stole the dress. Detective Ralph Fluhart said he had been tracking
the woman since then.
   The woman, who has not yet been charged in Michigan, faces a
charge of felony larceny, which carries up to five years in prison
and a $2,500 fine.

   An agency trying to predict earthquakes
has developed a system to give warnings of another geological
hazard: landslides, which 25 to 50 Americans and cause up to $2
billion in damage each year.
   The experimental system so far has been used only in the San
Francisco Bay area.
   But it is meant to demonstrate the possibility of issuing such
warnings elsewhere in the nation so people in slide-prone hilly
areas can evacuate if necessary, U.S. Geological Survey geologist
Raymond Wilson said Thursday.
   Wilson likened landslides to ``a runaway freight train going
through a neighborhood.''
   ``It's a national problem,'' said David Keefer, leader of the
agency's landslide research group. ``Total U.S. landslide damages
are estimated at somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion a
year,'' with 25 to 50 Americans killed annually.
   ``Landslide damages (in the United States) are larger on an
annual basis that earthquake damage or volcano damage,'' he added.
   They spoke at the Geological Survey's Geohazards '88 symposium,
which drew about 250 scientists and public officials. The two-day
symposium focuses on the hazards posed by earthquakes, landslides,
volcanoes and water pollution.
   The warning system was tested successfully on Feb. 14, 1986, when
a severe rainstorm prompted the Geological Survey and National
Weather Service to warn that mudslides were possible during a
six-hour period for much of the Bay area.
   Similar warnings were issued in Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties,
north of the Bay, for a 60-hour period beginning Feb. 17, 1986.
   Eight of 10 known landslides during that storm occurred during
the two warning periods, the scientists said, although they added it
wasn't possible to know if lives were saved by the alerts.
   The weather service transmitted the warnings to newspapers and
radio and TV stations in its regular forecasts, special weather
statements and flash flood warnings.
   The Bay area has been relatively dry since 1986 and no warnings
have been issued since then, he added.
   The agency depends on 60 Bay area rain gauges that automatically
relay measurements to the Geological Survey and the Weather Service,
and on reports from nearly 400 volunteers who have backyard rain
gauges.
   The Geological Survey developed the warning system after a storm
in 1982 dropped as much as 24 inches of rain in 34 hours, triggering
18,000 landslides in nine Bay-area counties, said geologist Earl
Brabb. In all the years before 1982, geologists had mapped 70,000
landslides in the same counties, he said.

   A controversial Taiwanese author who has attacked
both the mainland communist government and the rival Nationalists on
Taiwan was mobbed by young fans during his first trip to the
mainland in 39 years.
   Bo Yang visited the northwestern city of Xian last week to
collect about $2,000 in royalties for three books and visit a
daughter he hasn't seen since fleeing to Taiwan in 1949, the
official China News Service said in a report seen in Beijing today.
   More than 300 young fans surrounded Bo and clamored for his
autograph when he went to a Xian bookstore to sign locally published
copies of his books, the report said.
   Bo was born Guo Yidong in Kaifeng, Henan province. He fled to
Taiwan when the communists took over the mainland in 1949 and was a
harsh critic of the communists in the 1950s. But in the 1960s he
attacked Taiwan's Nationalist government, which then jailed him for
nine years as a communist spy.
   Critics on Taiwan and the mainland criticized him for his 1984
book, ``The Ugly Chinaman,'' a critique of Chinese culture.
   Five editions were printed in the mainland in 1986 and sold
quickly among young intellectuals before the book was banned in 1987.
   Bo arrived on the mainland Oct. 20 and has visited Shanghai and
Beijing.

<HEAD>`Rumors,' A New Play by Neil Simon, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS four grafs of other reviews; No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can't accuse Neil Simon of shortchanging the
audience on plot in his latest comedy, ``Rumors,'' which opened
Thursday at Broadway's Broadhurst Theater.
   There are gunshots, a car crash, several marital spats, group
therapy by telephone and enough household accidents to fill the
emergency room at Bellevue.
   With his autobiographical trilogy of ``Brighton Beach Memoirs,''
``Biloxi Blues'' and ``Broadway Bound'' complete, Simon has returned
to the more machine-gun style of comedy writing he perfected in
plays like ``The Odd Couple'' and ``The Sunshine Boys.''
   ``Rumors'' isn't in that class, but it does offer some slam-bang
humor, particularly in a delirious first act.
   The playwright calls ``Rumors'' a farce, and you'll know that as
soon as the curtain goes up on designer Tony Straiges' opulent
two-story suburban living room. There are seven doors, three
upstairs and four down, just waiting to be opened and slammed shut.
   We're at a 10th anniversary party for a couple named Charlie and
Myra. Everybody's done up in tuxedos and evening dresses, and the
food is in the kitchen waiting to be prepared. But where are the
hosts? Well, Charlie's upstairs in the bedroom after shooting
himself in the ear. Myra can't be found, although no one seems to
suspect foul play.
   The guests, who include Charlie's lawyer, tax accountant,
pyschoanalyst and a would-be state senator as well as their wives,
try to pretend that nothing is wrong. For much of Act 1, their
pretense is amusing, particularly when carried out by such masters
of desperation as Ron Leibman, the harried accountant done in by
whiplash from that auto accident, and Christine Baranski, the
lawyer's wife who can't quite get over her nicotine habit.
   Miss Baranski is a vision of comic neurosis. Dressed in a poufy
pink miniskirt (a witty design by Joseph G. Aulisi), she frantically
puffs her way through the play with a conviction that is supremely
funny.
   The weird thing is why these guests are so secretive about
Charlie's and Myra's difficulties and why they want to keep things
hush-hush, even from each other. Their deceptions cause all the
panic on stage, and yet they are not explained convincingly.
   Still, if you ignore the logic, you can savor director Gene Saks'
brilliant job of orchestrating the partygoers' maniacal behavior.
There are Joyce Van Patten's contortions as she drops to the floor
without warning. She explains that she has a bad back and never
knows when spasms might occur.
   Mark Nelson, Miss Baranski's cautious lawyer husband, spends much
of the play misinterpreting conversation. He was sitting too close
when one of those gunshots went off.
   Andre Gregory, his fingers bandaged after a particularly nasty
kitchen burn, has a tough time serving drinks with his singed
digits. Jessica Walter, nursing a bruised lip from the battered BMW,
tries to calm her hysterical husband, the volatile Mr. Liebman. And
Lisa Banes smolders sexily as the pent-up wife of the politician,
played with the right degree of pomposity by Ken Howard.
   Simon certainly keeps his story spinning well into the second
act. The problem is getting the plot to stop. He introduces a
policeman (Charles Brown) who wants this frantic crowd to explain
what has been going on. Liebman is chosen to tell what happened and
in a wild tour de force makes up a tale that the policeman agrees to
accept because he likes it.
   Liebman's concocted story doesn't end the play. It just sets up
an unconvincing ending. That's something that shouldn't happen in a
farce, surely one of the most difficult things to write. After all
that running around, the strands of the plot should be tied up
neatly. In ``Rumors,'' they are covered up by the final curtain. But
until that unsatisfactory conclusion, there is much to cheer _ and
laugh at _ in ``Rumors.''
   In other reviews:
   Frank Rich in The New York Times wrote: ``Maybe I've led a
charmed life, but I can't recall hearing this many toilet jokes
since the ninth grade. ... Mr. Simon may have been too long away
from his original calling; a lot of his gag machinery is rusty.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel called the play ``scattershot''
and said it seemed as if it were written by a side of Simon that
``turns out comedies with no soul, where every other line is
intended to get a laugh, as if to meet some abstract quota.''
   But Clive Barnes in the New York Post said, ``Broadway has
something to cheer about again! ... Totally frivolous, this maze of
mendacity is light, frothy and fun. It is as significant as a cream
puff and just about as nourishing. But beautifully baked and
cunningly filled.''

<TEXT>
   To Israel's great relief, the latest moves by
the Palestine Liberation Organization were given a tepid reception
by the Reagan and soon-to-be Bush administrations.
   The White House detected some ``positive elements'' in the latest
session of the PLO's quasi-legislature and the State Department
found some encouraging signs.
   But the Reagan administration did not pick up chairman Yasser
Arafat's invitation to use the policy statement adopted Tuesday in
Algiers by the Palestine National Council as a vehicle for seeking
concessions from Israel.
   And from inside the Bush camp came the judgment that the PLO had
taken ``a slight step forward'' in the right direction under
pressure from Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But, an anonymous Bush foreign policy aide told The New York
Times: ``They're still operating on the basis of the lowest common
denominator. To meet them and reward them would send the wrong
signal.''
   Bush, meanwhile, said ``the jury is still out'' and added
ambiguously: ``There may be reason to be less fully optimistic about
it.''
   Israel, in the throes of trying to form a new government, already
had dismissed the PLO moves as irrelevant. So the U.S. reaction must
have been a welcome relief.
   However, the Soviet Union, following in the path of some two
dozen Arab and Third World countries, recognized the PLO's
declaration of independence.
   That kept the heat on Israel at week's end, and it could be
turned up if the West Europeans decide the PLO has gone far enough
to warrant concessions from Israel.
   William B. Quandt, the National Security Council's Middle East
specialist under former President Jimmy Carter, says the PLO has
made a significant move, ``inadequate as it may be.''
   In an interview Thursday, the Brookings scholar said ``we ought
to make a statement that invites another move.''
   He has studied the texts in Arabic and compared them to the
Palestine National Council's statements last year. Quandt finds a
number of differences.
   In 1987, for instance, the Council reinvoked the PLO charter that
calls for dismantling Israel as a Jewish state. Not this time.
   The Council last year rejected U.N. Security Council resolution
242 as a basis for a peace conference. This time it was endorsed.
   Last time, all U.N. resolutions dealing with Israel, including
the one in 1947 that provided for a much smaller piece of Palestine,
were cited as a basis for negotiations. This time, Quandt said, the
resolutions were cited to support ``self-determination'' for the
Palestinians.
   ``They don't deal with recognition the way I would like,'' Quandt
said. For instance, the Council did not say if the Palestinians got
their own state they would be willing to live side-by-side with
Israel.
   ``What they haven't quite bit the bullet on is to say `We're
ready to negotiate with Israel on the basis of 242, instead of going
to a peace conference on that basis,'' the former U.S. official
said. ``That would remove some ambiguity.''
   In any event, the Council has not met the three-part U.S. test
for recognition, and Israelis of varying political stripes did not
revise their abhorrence of the PLO and terrorism.
   The Council's most significant move was to declare its readiness
to have peace talks held under U.N. Security Council resolution 242.
Adopted after the Arabs were routed by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day
war, it affirms the right of states in the region to live within
secure borders.
   Recognition of Israel is not specified in the resolution, only
implied.
   The two other parts of the U.S. test are that the PLO explicitly
recognize Israel and that it renounce terrorism. The Council did not
recognize the Jewish state and asserted force could be used by
guerrillas in Israel and on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Whatever the PLO's motives, which could range from an
unwillingness to play all their cards before there is a peace
conference to unrelenting hostility to Israel, the failure to meet
the test keeps the United States from responding to Arafat's
challenge.
   ``We feel that the ball is now in the American court,'' he said
Tuesday in Algiers.
   Clearly, the Reagan and Bush administrations don't agree.

   The Navy is recommending that the civilian
crewmen on the munitions train that maimed an antiwar demonstrator
last year receive 10-day suspensions.
   The union representative for the three crewmen, James Wright of
the American Federation of Government Employees, accused the Navy of
making the crew scapegoats for the incident at the Concord Naval
Weapons Station.
   S. Brian Willson lost his lower legs after sitting on the tracks
in front of a moving train at the base 40 miles east of San
Francisco. He was part of a group of demonstrators protesting
American involvement in Central America.
   The crewmen were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing but have been
on disability leave ever since, claiming they were traumatized by
the incident.
   They have 30 days to appeal the Navy's recommendation, which was
signed by Capt. Joseph Micelli of the Naval Sea Systems Command in
Washington. A Navy spokeswoman Thursday declined to comment on the
proposed suspension.
   Brakeman Bob Mayfield, who received his letter Wednesday, said he
and the other crew members would fight the suspensions.
   A lawyer for Willson, A.J. Kutchins, said the Navy's action
``certainly gives the lie to statements in the press that these men
were merely innocent victims of Brian Willson, who had the nerve to
get himself run over.''
   Willson is suing the crew and Navy officials; the crew has
countersued Willson and the same Navy officials.

<TEXT>
   The commandant of the U.S. Naval Academy
has apologized to Yale University's cheerleading captain for an
incident in which a cheerleader was passed hand-to-hand through the
stands at a football game.
   The sophomore cheerleader, Kim Reeder, complained that midshipmen
bruised, scratched and fondled her as she was carried feet-first
into the bleachers before the start of the Oct. 1 Yale-Navy game.
   The Oct. 31 letter from Capt. Howard W. Habermeyer was sent to
Anna Maria Chavez, head of the Yale cheerleading team. The letter,
described as a personal apology by academy spokesman Jay Fromkin,
was not released.
   ``He tried to explain it as a tradition,'' Ms. Chavez said. ``But
when it got out of hand, it obviously wasn't something they
condoned. It's over, but not to the extent that it should be
forgotten. Hopefully, all this will prevent it from happening
again.''
   Academy officials have said the midshipmen meant no harm to the
young woman and that such ``captures'' are a tradition at sporting
events.
   Betty Trachtenberg, dean of student affairs at Yale, said she
also had received an apology from academy officials.
   ``That letter was adequate; it's a closed issue,'' said Ms.
Trachtenberg, who previously called the incident ``a form of sexual
assault.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
began a three-day visit to India today, pledging to maintain warm
relations with Indian despite ``comments and speculations'' to the
contrary.
   In an apparent reference to an improvement in both nations' ties
with China, Gorbachev said ``the development of relations with third
countries'' would not affect Soviet-Indian relations.
   Gorbachev's remarks were contained in a speech given at a dinner
attended by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on the first day of the
Soviet leader's three-day visit to India.
   Indian authorities, mindful of Afghan refugee opposition to
Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, asked the estimated 7,000 Afghans
living in New Delhi to stay in their homes while Gorbachev is in
town.
   Gorbachev did not mention China in his speech, a text of which
was released by the Indian Foreign Ministry.
   But it followed concerns expressed by some Indian newspapers and
by some Indian officials that warmer relations between the world's
two biggest communist powers could affect Moscow's friendly ties
with India.
   Referring to ``some comments and speculations that are not
exactly friendly,'' Gorbachev said: ``Some go as far as saying that
the Soviet Union is changing its priorities, even becoming cool to
India. ...
   ``I shall not dignify with an answer such totally groundless and
obviously speculative remarks,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev's visit to India, his second in two years, comes a
month before Gandhi is to travel to Beijing, the first trip to China
by an Indian prime minister in 34 years.
   India and China have a longstanding border dispute and went to
war in 1962.
   There also are signs of an easing of strains between Moscow and
Beijing, highlighted by next year's scheduled Moscow visit by senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa arrived in New Delhi to a welcome
marked by tons of roses decking the highway taken by his motorcade.
It was his first trip abroad since the title of presidency was added
to his position as party leader nearly two months ago.
   After a ceremonial reception, Gorbachev held the first of at
least four scheduled talks with Gandhi.
   An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, who under briefing rules
cannot be identified, said the two leaders discussed general global
and regional matters but did not discuss specifics.
   Schools were closed today in honor of Gorbachev's visit. More
than 100,000 students and 10,000 teachers were asked to stand along
the Soviet motorcade route, newspapers reported.
   Afghan refugees said they have been instructed to stay off the
streets, except to report to their nearest police stations every
morning while Gorbachev is here.
   ``The police want to make sure all heads are accounted for,''
said Syed Mohammad Maiwand, chairman of the International Afghan
Elders Association, which claims 1,300 members in New Delhi. ``They
are treating us as if we were criminals.''
   India, a founding member of the movement of non-aligned nations,
has friendly relations with Moscow and Washington. But the Soviets
are a chief supplier of military equipment, including jet fighter
planes and tanks.
   On Wednesday, the two countries signed a trade agreement for
imports and exports worth $4.7 billion in 1989 _ more than double
the estimated $1.9 billion for 1987.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to return to Moscow on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Postal inspectors are investigating complaints
from people who say they thought they had won a $5,000 cash prize
from a cancer research group only to find they received a dime in
return for a donation.
   ``We are in the fact-gathering stage at this point,'' Tom McClure
of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said today.
   Watson and Hughey Co., a direct-mail firm in Alexandria, Va.,
sent letters soliciting participation in a fund-raising campaign on
behalf of three cancer research organizations.
   The Washington Post said one state official estimated the
solicitation went to 48 million households in the country but Jerry
Watson, a partner in Watson and Hughey, said that number is
exaggerated.
   ``Our company designs maybe a hundred different sweepstakes a
year,'' he said, ``and together the mailings don't add to that
number.''
   Watson said his company is only an advertising agency and has all
copy for sweepstakes _ including the one involved _ checked by
lawyers. ``I'm not sure what the problem is,'' he said.
   The letters state that the recipient has ``won a cash prize in
the $5,000 Sweepstakes'' and ask for a voluntary contribution of $5,
but closer reading reveals that the total value of the contest is
$5,000, with a maximum individual award of $100 and a minimum of 10
cents.
   ``We have complaints where individuals have sent money in, made
contributions and received back a dime prize,'' McClure said.
   Asked whether anyone had received a $100 award, McClure said
``when people get that kind of money back, they usually don't
complain.''
   He said a dime prize falls into a gray area of the law, since it
is a cash award.
   The Post said the letters were signed by Washington attorney
Robert R. Stone and sent on behalf of the Pacific West Cancer Fund
of Seattle, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based Cancer Fund of America and
the Walker Cancer Research Institute of Edgewood, Md.
   Efforts to reach Stone by telephone were unsuccessful; his line
was being checked for trouble, according to a recorded announcement.
   The Post quoted Stone as saying the solicitation was a legitimate
fund-raising effort for worthwhile organizations and that he thought
the letter was clear.
   The Post said the mailings have prompted calls to consumer and
legal agencies from people believing they had won $5,000, lawsuits
alleging consumer fraud in Missouri and Illinois, consumer warnings
in other states and investigations in Virginia and by the federal
government.

   President-elect George Bush is whittling away
at the list of vacancies in his new administration, but there are
still so many top openings that the name-guessing game is the
hottest thing in town.
   Bush picked John Sununu, the retiring New Hampshire governor, as
his chief of staff on Wednesday, and chose Lee Atwater, his election
campaign manager, as chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   Word of the latest appointments leaked out before they were
officially announced, but many decisions on who's in and who's out
are tightly held by the inner circle of transition aides.
   Bush is known to dislike palace infighting, and some hopefuls are
keeping out of the public eye. Deborah Steelman, for example.
   ``She's lying low,'' a friend said of Steelman, 33, one of Bush's
key domestic campaign advisers. She's been talked about for a
high-ranking job somewhere, possibly at the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
   Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, who lost his bid to unseat
Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum this month, has emerged as a
leading candidate to head HUD.
   ``I am very pleased with all the rumors flying around that I'm
being considered for something in Washington, but the fact of the
matter is that I have made no contact whatsoever,'' Voinovich said
earlier this week. But he said he would listen to any job offers
made to him by Bush.
   Donald Rumsfeld, a candidate for defense secretary, uttered what
has come to be a common refrain around town. ``I'm not in the habit
of accepting things that haven't been offered,'' he said. Even so,
he's interested in the post he held in the Ford administration.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, a loser to Bush in the GOP presidential
primaries, is being pushed by conservatives for a good job in the
administration.
   Business groups are touting the former football quarterback for
labor secretary to replace Ann Dore McLaughlin, or even HUD
secretary, replacing Samuel Pierce.
   Bush has ordered staffers to keep their mouths shut, though he's
indicated he is considering people for important posts in his
economic team and soon will turn to national security posts. Two
Cabinet jobs already have been filled: James A. Baker III as
secretary of state and Nicholas Brady as treasury secretary.
   The latest thinking is that former Texas Sen. John Tower's stock
is still high to take over the Defense Department. He has good
relations with Congress and he knows the subject matter: He used to
chair the Armed Services Committee, and he was a member of the U.S.
delegation to superpower arms talks in Geneva.
   Other possible Pentagon chiefs are Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of
the Aluminum Co. of America, and retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent
Scowcroft, onetime head of the National Security Council.
   Some new names surfaced Thursday for transportation secretary,
but they're viewed as longshots. They include John Riley, head of
the Federal Railroad Administration, and Allan McArtor, head of the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   Still seen as contenders are Jim Burnett, a member and former
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, New Jersey
Gov. Thomas Kean and Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., who ran Bush's
campaign in New York.
   Craig Fuller, co-director of the Bush transition office, had been
talked about for the transportation job, but he announced on
Wednesday that he will leave government after failing to win the
White House chief of staff post.

   Four black activists, including
three leaders of the country's largest anti-apartheid group, were
convicted today of treason. They and seven co-defendants convicted
of terrorism could be put to death.
   The verdicts culminated a three-year trial on the role of the
United Democratic Front, a pro-black rights coalition formed in
1983. The state alleged the front incited anti-government violence
in black townships in 1984, at a time when the coalition's leaders
said they advocated peaceful protest.
   Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst described the front as a
``revolutionary organization'' which sought to overthrow the
government.
   Three of those convicted of treason were senior leaders who had
spent 40 months in jail without bail _ Popo Molefe, 36, who was the
coalition's national secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, who was its chief
spokesman; and Moses Chikane, 40, a leader of its Transvaal Province
branch.
   Also convicted of treason was the Rev. Thomas Manthatha, an
activist in the Vaal Triangle area south of Johannesburg where the
first wave of unrest flared in September 1984. Sentences are
scheduled to begin Dec. 5.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a coalition supporter, said the
convicted men were ``gentle, rational people who in a democratic
society would be regarded as civic-minded and public spirited
leaders.''
   ``I'm shattered by the verdict,'' Tutu said. ``If any of these
people are sent to prison, I will not rest until I get them out. If
this is treason, then I am guilty of treason.''
   Eight of the 19 defendants were acquitted on all charges and
seven were convicted of terrorism related to unrest in the Vaal
Triangle.
   A crowd, which included U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, packed
into the courtroom but was subdued when Dijkhorst announced the
verdicts. The judge began reading 1,521-page trial summary Tuesday,
and his preliminary conclusions this week left no doubt the top
defendants would be convicted.
   ``We haven't given up. We will always maintain that the UDF is a
non-violent organization,'' said Chikane before he and his
colleagues gave clenched-fist salutes and were led away.
   ``This is very disappointing,'' said anti-apartheid activist
Helen Suzman, a member of Parliament. ``This very much narrows the
field of protest.''
   The front, banned earlier this year, was formed to mobilize
opposition to a new constitution that entrenched the exclusion of
the black majority from representation in Parliament. Under
apartheid, blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The defendants had pleaded innocent to charges of treason,
terrorism, murder and subversion related to the central allegation
that the front and its affiliates incited violence in 1984 to make
South Africa ungovernable.
   Van Dijkhorst said the state proved treason because violence was
an intended facet of the township uprisings. He also accepted
prosecutors' allegation that the core of the front's leadership was
supported and guided by the African National Congress, the main
anti-government guerrilla movement.
   The front has maintained it endorsed the front's political goals,
such as a one-person, one-vote system, but did not promote the use
of violence.
   Before its banning in February, the front had become the largest
opposition group in South Africa, encompassing more than 600
affiliated groups with 2 million members. Most front leaders are in
detention, in hiding or barred from political activity.
   Van Dijkhorst presided over the non-jury trial since its start in
1985.

   Moslem worshipers released balloons bearing the
image of PLO chief Yasser Arafat and waved outlawed Palestinian
flags after weekly prayers today to celebrate the declaration of
Palestinian statehood.
   In the Gaza Strip, three Palestinian youths were wounded, one
critically, in clashes with Israeli troops.
   Throughout the occupied lands, troops were deployed near mosques
to prevent nationalist demonstrations after Moslem noon prayers, the
high point of the Moslem week and often the scene of anti-Israeli
protests.
   This week's gatherings offered the first opportunity for many
Palestinians to celebrate independence because of widespread curfews
and travel restrictions imposed by the army earlier this week.
   Also today, Palestinians ignored strike orders issued in the name
of the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas to protest the proclamation
of statehood issued in Algeria by the Palestine National Council,
the parliament-in-exile of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Leaders of Hamas, Arabic for ``zeal,'' claimed leaflets bearing
the strike order were forged to confuse and divide Palestinian
activists. It was not known if this was true or if the strike call
failed for lack of organization and support. Hamas, a chief rival of
the PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, opposes
the declaration of statehood because it implicitly recognizes Israel.
   At a mosque in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, worshipers
released balloons bearing Arafat's image after prayers, an Arab
reporter said. Youths also burned tires near the mosque, but
soldiers did not interfere.
   At three mosques in Khan Yunis, troops blocked worshipers from
entering for prayers, the witnesses said.
   A few dozen women carrying outlawed Palestinian flags sang the
anthem ``My Homeland, My Homeland'' after prayers at the Al Aqsa
mosque on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Haram
as-Sharif.
   Three Palestinian youths were wounded in separate clashes in the
Gaza Strip today, including a 16-year-old who was in critical
condition with a gunshot wound that fractured his skull, doctors at
Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said. Army officials said they were
checking the reports.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres held a briefing for diplomats from
42 countries today to explain Israel's rejection of the PLO
independence declaration. An aide quoted Peres as saying the
declaration's implicit recognition of Israel ``was an attempt to
mislead public opinion.''
   East Germany, Cyprus and Lebanon today formally recognized the
independent Palestinian state, bringing to at least 28 the number of
nations that have recognized it.
   The Soviet Union today recognized the proclamation of an
independent Palestinian state but stopped short of extending full
diplomatic relations. The Soviet action comes at a time when the
Soviets are moving toward closer ties with Israel after breaking
relations in 1967.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel declined to respond
to the Soviet move, saying Israel had to ``study and analyze it.''
   The army imposed widespread curfews and travel restrictions on
most of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied lands in the
days preceding and following the proclamation to choke off
expressions of nationalist fervor.
   The restrictions have been eased gradually since Thursday, and in
the final move the army lifted curfews on Gaza's eight refugee camps
today.
   More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded since the uprising
started Dec. 8. The death toll in the revolt is 313 Palestinians and
11 Israelis.

   Alabama NAACP President Thomas Reed was
sentenced to four years in prison today for taking a $10,000 bribe
to try to help a murderer win early release, and automatically lost
his state House seat.
   ``You used your power ... to line your pockets,'' U.S. District
Judge Joel Dubina told Reed, at 60 the senior black in the
Legislature.
   Reed was convicted on two counts of extortion. The charges
carried a maximum penalty of 25 years in federal prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   ``Judge, I know I'm not guilty,'' he told Dubina today.
   A state judge previously ruled that Reed, who in 1970 became one
of the first two blacks elected to the Legislature this century,
would lose his seat in the House upon sentencing. Dubina ordered
Reed to report to prison Jan. 3.
   Reed was convicted of taking a bribe from a businessman in
exchange for attempting to win early release for the man's nephew,
an imprisoned murderer. He contacted the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles on the man's behalf.
   The businessman, Bobby Gene Chesser of Columbus, Ga., testified
against Reed and was not charged. The nephew, Anthony Dennis
Chesser, continues to serve a 40-year sentence for the murder of his
wife.
   The Tuskegee Democrat has blamed his prosecution on his attempt
to have the Confederate battle flag removed from atop Alabama's
Capitol.
   A state judge has delayed the trespassing trial of Reed and 13
other black lawmakers arrested during the Feb. 2 flag protest, in
which they grabbed a chain-link fence surrounding the Capitol in a
symbolic attempt to enter the grounds of the building, closed for
renovation, and remove the Rebel banner.
   Reed told Dubina during a hearing Thursday he had remembered
evidence not presented during his trial.
   While prosecutors contended Reed accepted the bribe over a
three-day period in 1986, Reed said Thursday he was visiting a
farmer, a relative and a prison at the time but was ``so confused''
during the trial that he did not recall the alibi.
   Dubina refused to grant a new trial

   A federal judge today sentenced former U.S. Rep.
Mario Biaggi to eight years in prison for racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal.
   In a tearful plea to U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley,
the former 10-term congressman maintained his innocence and pleaded
for leniency for his co-defendant and eldest son, Richard.
   ``I appeal to you as a father,'' a sobbing Biaggi said. ``Do what
you want with me. My time is done. Don't hurt Richard.'' The younger
Biaggi was to be sentenced later in the day.
   Biaggi, 71, sat slumped in his chair but showed no emotion while
Motley sentenced him.
   He was convicted Aug. 5 of turning Wedtech Corp., a now-defunct
South Bronx defense contractor, into a racketeering enterprise that
paid out millions of dollars in bribes to public officials for help
in winning no-bid contracts.
   The Bronx Democrat, who resigned from office a day after his
conviction, already has been sentenced to 2{ years in prison for
obstruction and taking an illegal gratuity in an unrelated case but
remained free on appeal.
   The judge said today's sentence would run concurrently with the
prvious one. Biaggi was ordered to report to authorities on Jan. 8.
   Biaggi was the first of five defendants in the Wedtech trial to
be sentenced today. He faced a maximum sentence of 146 years in
prison and $7 million in fines.
   In a final plea, the white-haired Biaggi _ dressed in a navy-blue
pinstriped suit and leaning heavily on the cane he has used since he
was wounded in his days as a New York City police officer _ said the
five-month trial and the month of ``devastating publicity'' before
his indictment were punishment enough.
   ``There wasn't a day I didn't suffer,'' Biaggi said. ``I died a
little bit every day. I started to die some time ago.''
   ``I'm still of the belief, I always have been, that I am
innocent,'' he said. He added, ``The worst possible punishment your
honor could administer would be to put my son in prison.''
   The judge received some 170 letters, including 37 from Republican
and Democratic congressmen, urging leniency and recounting Biaggi's
many contributions over the years.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, wrote that Biaggi's resignation was ``a powerful
punishment in and of itself.'' Biaggi had averted impeachment and
removal by his colleagues.
   Biaggi, a former hero police officer in New York City, was
convicted of extorting cash and stock, once worth more than $3
million, from Wedtech in exchange for his political clout. He also
was convicted of filing false financial disclosure statements and
tax returns to cover up his illegal profits.
   At least 19 people have been convicted of crimes ranging from
racketeering to illegal lobbying in the Wedtech scandal. They
include a former top White House aide, two former Maryland state
senators and two Teamsters officers.
   Biaggi was convicted in 1987 on charges of taking an illegal
gratuity to use his clout on behalf of a shipyard.

<HEAD>Refinancing Interest May Not Be Fully Deducted First Year, Court
Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Interest points paid to refinance a home
mortgage may not be deducted fully in the year the loan is obtained,
the U.S. Tax Court ruled Friday.
   The court's decision, on an 8-3 vote, upheld the position taken
by the Internal Revenue Service and means that points must be
written off over the life of a home loan. The ruling has no effect
on points that must be paid to secure a loan that is used directly
to buy or improve a home.
   Points essentially are an additional interest charge that some
lenders impose to get around laws that limit interest rates. They
sometimes are paid by a homebuyer, sometimes by a seller.
   The Tax Court case, which could be appealed, grew out of a
January 1981 decision by James R. and Zenith A. Huntsman to buy a
home in Stillwater, Minn. Instead of a more traditional 20-year or
30-year mortgage, they obtained a $122,000 mortgage with a final
balloon payment three years later. Before that three years was up,
they took out a second mortgage for a $22,000 home-improvement loan.
   Less than four months before the first mortgage fell due, the
Huntsmans refinanced their home with a 30-year loan that was used to
pay off the first and second mortgages. To obtain the new loan, they
had to pay $4,440 in points, which they deducted on their tax return.
   The IRS disallowed the full deduction on grounds the new loan was
not used to buy or improve the Huntsmans' home. The Huntsmans were
told they could deduct only $148 in each of the 30 years.
   The law is unclear, saying that points are fully deductible in
the year they were paid only when the loan was used ``in connection
with the purchase or improvement'' of a home.
   ``In a refinancing transaction, the funds generated by the loans
generally are used not to purchase or improve a principal residence
but to pay off the loan that is already in existence and thereby
lower the interest costs incurred or achieve some other financial
goal not connected directly with home ownership,'' Judge Theodore
Tannenwald Jr. wrote for the majority of the court.
   As a result, the court held, Congress did not mean to allow an
immediate full deduction for such points.
   The key point was precisely what Congress meant by the words ``in
connection with.'' Tannenwald noted that in its own explanation
ofthe 1975 law, Congress had stated that immediate deduction would
not be permitted if a loan was ``used for purposes other than
purchasing or improving the taxpayer's principal residence.''
   Dissenting judges contended that the ultimate purpose of the
Huntsmans' 30-year refinancing mortgage was to buy their home.
   ``The hard reality is that ... (the Huntsmans) were locked into a
situation which necessitated that they obtain permanent financing
(or at least some type of refinancing) within three years of the
date of the purchase,'' Judge Robert Ruwe wrote for the minority.
   When the Huntsmans took out their original loan, Ruwe wrote, it
would have been evident to them and their lenders that the mortgage
would have to be refinanced. (The couple, with two dependent
children, reported an income of about $71,000 in 1983).
   ``From the standpoint of an ordinary person who is purchasing a
home with the proceeds of a large loan, payable three years from the
date of purchase, refinancing would be a foreseeable necessity `in
connection with' the purchase,'' the dissenters contended.

   Mayor Kathy Whitmire, serving her fourth term as
leader of the nation's fourth-largest city, says she is planning to
run for re-election in 1989.
   Mrs. Whitmire reportedly mentioned her intention Thursday in an
off-hand remark at the organizational meeting of the Houston
Breakfast Leadership Forum.
   ```By the way, if anyone is wondering, I do intend to run for
re-election,''' Cindy Clifford, one of the organizers, quoted the
mayor as saying.
   Asked Thursday night to confirm the report, Mrs. Whitmire said:
``I'm not starting a campaign tonight or making an announcement of
campaign plans today. It's no secret, and it hasn't been, that I
have no plans to quit at the end of this term and have been planning
to seek another term if the voters allow me to do that.''
   Former Mayor Fred Hofheinz has said he is considering a mayoral
race next year.

   A law professor says his speech at an Internal
Revenue Service conference was canceled because he refused to cut
references to campaign contributions accepted by members of
congressional tax reform committees.
   The IRS, however, says that wasn't the reason Richard Doernberg's
invitation to deliver the speech was rescinded.
   Doernberg, an expert on tax reform at Emory University, said he
was to give the speech at the agency's sixth annual research
conference, held in Washington on Thursday and Friday.
   He said he planned to discuss his research showing that members
of the tax reform committees get 31 percent more campaign money than
other congressmen from companies and political action committees
lobbying for tax breaks.
   Doernberg said he refused to alter his speech, and on Nov. 4 he
was notified by Roger L. Plate, head of the IRS's research division,
that his invitation was being rescinded.
   Plate was attending the conference and could not be reached for
comment, but IRS spokesman Wilson Fadely said Thursday that
Doernberg's speech was canceled because it contained no new
information.
   ``We were looking for people that were coming up in research with
new approaches,'' he said. ``That was the type of forum it was.''
   Doernberg said he doesn't believe that.
   ``They had my articles when they called me up to invite me,'' he
said. ``They knew what I was going to say.''

   Police today arrested more than than 100
anti-abortion demonstrators blocking the doors to a Planned
Parenthood clinic.
   Some protesters were carried and a few dragged by police to buses
and police vans.
   Deputy Chief John Sturner said those arrested would be charged
with trespassing, and most would be issued citations to return to
court at a later date.
   The protesters began standing in front of the doors around 8
a.m., an hour before the clinic was scheduled to open.
   Thomas Webber, executive director of Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota, said he asked police to remove the protesters so
employees and people with appointments could enter. ``It's a
violation of law,'' Webber said. ``It's unconscionable.''
   The arrests ended around 11 a.m. and the clinic opened a
half-hour later, although about 30 protesters continued to march on
the sidewalk.
   Brian Gibson, associate director of Pro-Life Action Ministries of
St. Paul, said the protest was inspired by Operation Rescue, an
anti-abortion group that showed up in force in Atlanta during the
Democratic National Convention in July.
   ``This is a big day for abortions at Planned Parenthood and it's
our intention to stop the killing of babies,'' Gibson said.
   No abortions had been scheduled during the morning at the clinic;
people appointments later in the day were referred to other clinics,
Webber said. ``They (protesters) really haven't accomplished
anything,'' he said.
   About 1,300 people were arrested in several demonstrations in
Atlanta by Operation rescue. Hundreds more have been arrested in
other demonstrations orchestrated around the country by the
organization.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam War veterans are climbing back
aboard military helicopters to confront their painful memories as
part of a program treating them for post-traumatic stress syndrome.
   ``All Vietnam veterans seem to have at least several vivid
memories involving helicopters,'' said Dr. Raymond Scurfield,
director of the American Lake Veterans Administration hospital's
post-traumatic stress treatment clinic.
   Ten veterans at a time undergo an intense, 11-week program,
including rides aboard a Huey helicopter used in the Vietnam War.
   About 350 vets have been through the program since it was
established three years ago with the cooperation of the Washington
state National Guard, and it now has an 18-month waiting list,
Scurfield said.
   Post-traumatic stress syndrome is marked by intrusive imagery,
rage, depression, grief and feelings of isolation, he said.
   Helicopter therapy was proposed by Elke Faleafine, a licensed
nurse practitioner at the clinic who noticed that many veterans
reacted strongly to helicopter sounds during therapy sessions and
spoke often of Hueys.
   She suggested giving them a chance to relive that experience,
partly to overcome their fear of choppers but also to help bring to
the surface many of the memories and feelings they had been trying
desperately to suppress.
   ``A lot of feelings came up. A lot of memories came back,'' she
said. ``They remember a lot of friends they lost, but they also
remember how strong and together they felt.''
   On Thursday, a chopper made four flights at Fort Lewis carrying
veterans and clinic staffers in maneuvers similar to those most
commonly used in the war. In one maneuver used to drop off troops,
the helicopter banked at a 35-degree angle, swept toward a grassy
landing zone on the base and touched down briefly before racing away
a few feet above nearby trees.
   Some veterans held hands during the flight, many hugged each
other when it was over and one was near tears, saying the last time
he flew in a Huey was when he was flown from an ambush scene where
18 of his 35 comrades had died.
   ``Helicopters were a sign of death,'' said one of the vets, Jerry
Carlson, ``and, you know, they're part of life today.''
   Carlson said he enrolled in the program after finding himself
pointing a gun at his head after nearly two decades of recurring
drug abuse.
   The treatment had helped him stay off drugs and reduced his
``anger level,'' he said.
   ``I've got a lot of friends today who have known me since before
Vietnam, family members,'' he says. ``They can see a big difference,
and they tell me about it.''
   Loren Johnson, another veteran, looked dazed and drawn after his
helicopter ride but said it had helped.
   ``This time,'' he said, ``I realized the ship coming in wasn't
carrying any wounded or dead.''

   A woman earned money to buy crack by
holding down a 10-year-old girl while a school bus driver sexually
assaulted her, police said.
   Dorothea Tate, a 35-year-old mother of six, was jailed Wednesday
along the driver, Eugene Howard, 48, on $50,000 bail each, police
said.
   ``Tate was profiting from the 10-year-old,'' said Lt. Frank
Lagan. ``She was the pimp.''
   Lagan declined to describe Tate's relationship to the girl,
except to say they knew each other previously. He also refused to
say when or where the crimes took place and how much Howard
allegedly paid Tate.
   Tate was charged with sexual assault, promoting prostitution and
risking injury to a minor. Howard, who was previously convicted of
indecent exposure, was charged with sexual assault and risking
injury to a minor.
   Howard's criminal record came as a shock to some parents and
school officials.
   ``If he has a previous incident with police he shouldn't be
involved with children,'' said Lynn Holdt, president of the parents
group at an elementary school in Darien whose students were driven
by Howard. ``I know it's difficult to hire bus drivers but that's no
excuse.''
   Darien Superintendent of Schools James Loughran said the school
system was reviewing the incident with Laidlaw Transit Co., Howard's
employer.

   Whatever the outcome of Monday's election, it will
be remembered for the remarkable resurgence of Liberal Party leader
John Turner and his relentless attack on the free trade agreement
with the United States.
   Turner, lambasted for increased deficits when he was finance
minister and hiring goofs during a 79-day stint as prime minister,
has struck campaign pay dirt with an attack that portrays Canada as
a U.S. colony if the trade deal passes.
   His forceful charge to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney during a
televised debate _ ``You sold us out!'' _ invigorated a flagging
Liberal campaign and set the tone for its final days.
   Turner's nightmare vision of a weakened Canada has catapulted the
Liberals into a dead heat with Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
Party, according to polls.
   On Thursday, Turner told voters the deal would let United States
overwhelm Canada and turn it into a ``branch plant.''
   Only a Conservative majority government now will ensure that the
trade agreement starts Jan. 1 as scheduled. The agreement is to
phase out all remaining tariffs between the two countries over a
10-year period.
   The socialist New Democratic Party, expected to finish third
Monday, also opposes the trade agreement Mulroney signed with
President Reagan in January.
   The 1988 campaign already stands in sharp contrast to 1984, when
the Conservatives devastated the opposition to win 211 of the House
of Commons' 282 seats. The Liberals _ with Turner at the helm _ fell
from the 147 seats they won in 1980 to 40.
   In 1984, Turner inherited the Liberal Party leadership from
Pierre Trudeau and served as prime minister through the election. It
was the second-shortest term as prime minister ever in Canada.
   He was depicted as a fumbler for handing out patronage
appointments at the wrong time. A book about Turner _ ``Reign of
Error'' by Ottawa journalist Greg Weston _ has been a best seller
throughout the campaign.
   But Turner survived three internal challenges since the 1984
election to stay on at the top of the Liberal Party.
   Turner, 59, was born in England but came to Canada as a child.
His parents were an English journalist and a Canadian miner's
daughter.
   He first ran for Parliament in 1962 and in 1972 was promoted by
Trudeau to finance minister.
   His Conservative opponents delight in calling him the father of
the Canadian deficit, for in three years as finance minister,
government spending soared 80 percent and the deficit quintupled to
$5.4 billion.
   ``How are you going to pay for it?'' hecklers shout to his
campaign promises.
   The weekly Maclean's reported that the Liberal decision to focus
on free trade was made in early October when Mulroney seemed headed
for an easy victory.
   In campaign stops now, Turner refers to the pact as ``the issue
of the century for our country.''
   ``This election is a referendum on Canada's future,'' he says.
   The Liberal leader argues that the free trade agreement can
affect Canada's extensive social and health care programs.
   He insists his message is not anti-American and that relations
with the United States won't be disrupted if Canadians decide
against proceeding with the trade agreement.
   ``I am saying that the Americans are realists; they are
pragmatists,'' he was quoted as saying. ``They are not only our
largest customer, we are their largest customer.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has received a report from the
Pentagon listing options for a military response to the Soviet
Union's refusal to destroy a disputed Siberian radar facility, the
White House said Friday.
   No decisions on the matter have been made, however, and the
options will not be publicly disclosed, added B. Jay Cooper, a White
House spokesman.
   ``The Department of Defense has submitted a report to the White
House that's being reviewed now,'' Cooper said. ``It was submitted
on Monday.''
   According to other administration sources, who requested
anonymity, options in the report include such things as reversing
the planned dismantling of three U.S. Poseidon missile-firing
submarines, deploying a limited ballistic missile defense and
speeding up the testing of space weapons.
   The Washington Post reported in Friday editions that Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci had ordered the report forwarded to
Reagan without endorsing any of the options as desirable, primarily
because of their cost.
   The administration has accused the Soviets of violating the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 by constructing a radar
facility near Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, that could be used to organize a
defensive system to protect the Soviet Union against missile attack.
   The theory behind the ABM treaty is that if both sides are unable
to mount a defense, they will hesitate to launch an attack.
Otherwise, their territory and populations will be open to
devastating retaliation.
   The Soviets deny violating the treaty's terms but have proposed a
number of plans that they claim will ensure the Krasnoyarsk facility
is used only for peaceful purposes.
   The Reagan administration continues to insist that the radar be
torn down. The White House requested the military options report
from the Pentagon last summer when the Soviets rebuffed that demand.
   Asked Friday if the United States were considering halting
further negotiations over the matter, Cooper said, ``The report is
being reviewed now and those decisions have yet to be made, so I
don't want to speculate ... I wouldn't speculate on any options.''

   A B-1B bomber crashed and burned on a
runway at Ellsworth Air Force Base in the second accident involving
one of the long-range strategic jets in nine days, officials said
today. The crew of four parachuted to safety.
   The $280 million bomber apparently clipped utility wires as it
came in for a landing about 10:40 p.m. Thursday, said an Air Force
official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A witness said an engine was on fire before the crash, but
Pentagon sources in Washington said investigators were discounting
such reports.
   The crew ejected from the plane, officials said. One crew member
may have suffered a minor concussion and another had a possible back
injury, said Sgt. Tony Evans, a base spokesman. The other crew
members were unharmed, he said.
   The plane was on a routine training flight, the Air Force said.
   The crash came two days after officials reported that the Air
Force had inspected and cleared more than two-thirds of the 98 B-1B
bombers, which were grounded following a crash Nov. 8 that destroyed
one of the planes in Texas.
   Air Force officials today ruled out any connection between the
crashes Thursday and Nov. 8 and will not ground the fleet a second
time, Pentagon sources said.
   ``It was 25 degrees, fog, dew point 21 degrees. Unfortunately, it
looks like they clipped wires,'' a Pentagon official said of
Thursday's crash. Fog may have contributed to the accident, but
``the weather was within minimum safety standards,'' the source said.
   A witness, Dale Landreth, told radio station KOTA today, ``The
engine was on fire before it hit the ground,'' while police Lt. Fred
Brown said the plane may have come in too low and hit a utility pole.
   The crash Thursday was the fourth in the four years since the
United States began flying B-1 aircraft, the nation's first new
long-range bomber in more than 25 years.
   Brig. Gen. Robert Marquette, commander of the 12th Air Division
at Ellsworth, today said ``statistics will prove that it is a safer
airplane than previous bombers we've had at this point in the
maturity process.''
   Maj. Temple Black in Washington said a board of officers will
investigate.
   The long-range bomber built by Rockwell International is designed
to fly at high speed and low altitude and deliver nuclear weapons.
   Asked whether the bomber today was carrying nuclear weapons,
Evans said it is Air Force policy to neither confirm nor deny their
presence anywhere.
   Todd Heinle, a police officer in nearby Box Elder, said that it
was cloudy at the time of the crash and that he did not notice any
fog. He said he was a half-mile to a mile away and heard the plane
make a ``weird noise.''
   ``It almost sounded like the plane was trying to increase in
power,'' he said. He said he and a fellow officer saw the wings tilt
one way and then the other, then the lights in the plane went out.
``It was just a split second after the lights went out, there was an
explosion and the flames started to come up.''
   Heinle said he could not say whether the explosion occurred while
the plane was in the air.
   Harold Morgenstern, manager of a trailer court, said, ``It felt
like an earthquake.'' Morgenstern said he saw ``about a half-mile of
flames'' a couple hundred feet into the air.
   Last week, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air
Force Base in west Texas. The crew of four ejected and survived.
   The Air Force refused to speculate on the cause of the Texas
crash, although witnesses reported a fire around the two left
engines before the crash. SAC's grounding order mandated inspection
of electric, fuel and hydraulic lines.
   In addition to Ellsworth and Dyess, the bombers are deployed at
Grand Forks Air Force Base, N.D., and McConnell Air Force Base, Kan.
   The Air Force has been criticized for its handling of the B-1B
program, primarily because of acknowledged problems in developing
its radar-jamming gear. The service insists the plane is the best
long-range bomber in the world.
   The B-1 originally was killed in 1977 by President Carter, but
Reagan reversed that decision four years later and approved the
purchase of 100 B-1s for a total of $27.3 billion. Rockwell has
built all 100.
   Reagan said the plane was needed to replace the aging B-52s in
the nation's long-range bomber arsenal until the Stealth bomber
becomes available.

<HEAD>GOP Candidate Hired Poll Guards: Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Republican Assembly candidate's
campaign paid for signs reading ``Non-citizens can't vote'' that
uniformed guards carried in Hispanic neighborhoods on Election Day,
campaign officials said.
   Assembly Democrats have said they plan to file a federal lawsuit
on behalf of at least 12 Hispanics who said they were intimidated
and did not vote.
   Republican Curt Pringle, declared the winner over Christian
Thierbach by 867 votes after absentee ballots were counted, said
Thursday he knew an aide was working on the polling program but
didn't know the program's specifics.
   ``Maybe that will come down badly on me,'' he said.
   Pringle's campaign organization paid for the signs over the
objections of Orange County Republican Central Committee Chairman
Thomas Fuentes, according to Fuentes and Pringle's campaign manager,
Marcia Gilchrist.
   Fuentes said he was surprised when he saw the signs Nov. 8.
   However, the guards were hired by the county GOP organization,
which said it had heard rumors that Democrats were going to bring in
people not legally able to vote.
   And Fuentes had initially said he took responsibility for the
polling program, which has been condemned by both Democratic and
Republican leaders.
   ``Tom Fuentes is doing the Olympic backstroke,'' said Democratic
Party Chairman John Hanna. ``After initially taking some of the
responsibility, he's been shocked at what many of us see is the
quite obvious uproar, and now he's trying to protect his own
political future.''

   A motorist who wants everyone to know
about her fight with an auto dealer has stepped up her campaign,
emboldened by a judge's ruling.
   Circuit Judge Henry F. Martin Jr. on Thursday lifted a
restraining order preventing Betty Cochran Turner from publicly
protesting repairs made to her car by Parrish Volvo Inc. He said the
order, which he imposed weeks earlier at the dealer's request,
violated right to free speech.
   Mrs. Turner promptly hired several airplanes to fly over the city
with banners reading ``Parrish Volvo Robbed Betty Turner.''
   Mrs. Turner has spent at least $8,500 in her dispute with the
dealer over what she claims were faulty repairs to her car last
summer. She rented a billboard near the dealership, rented an
electronic sign on a boat and placed an advertisement in a weekly
newspaper.
   Richard Parrish, president of the family-run dealership, said the
business had been hurt by the advertisements. The dealership has
denied making faulty repairs. ``We feel this is a direct slap at the
family name,'' he said.

   Democratic Party officials, trying to avoid a
leadership fight of their own, Friday denounced President-elect
George Bush's choice for Republican Party chairman as a practitioner
of ``a pit bull style of politics.''
   ``If Lee Atwater is going to be the next Republican chairman, I
think we know what the next election cycle is going to look like,''
said Texas Democratic Party chairman Robert Slagle.
   Atwater managed the Bush presidential campaign against Democrat
Michael Dukakis. Many Democrats blame him for the negative tone of
the Republican campaign.
   ``We are ready to take on Lee Atwater and those who would create
a pit bull style of politics,'' said Rick Wiener, the Michigan
Democratic Party chairman.
   The choice of Atwater gave the Democrats a chance to lash out at
a Republican instead of each other as they met for the first time
after their fifth defeat in the last six presidential elections.
   The occasion was a meeting of the Association of State Democratic
Chairs, and the principal order of business was not on the agenda _
it was to convince Paul G. Kirk Jr. to serve a second four-year term
as national party chairman.
   ``Keep Kirk,'' read big red and white buttons worn by many state
party officials.
   The chairman, sounding reluctant to stay on for another term, has
said he would listen to appeals from party officials before making
his final decision.
   At least five party activists, including three former
congressmen, intend to run for the job if Kirk decides not to stay.
   One of them, former Rep. James Stanton of Ohio, wore a ``Keep
Kirk'' button and told reporters, ``If he's a candidate, I support
him. If he's not, I'm a candidate.''
   Stanton was the least well-known contender in a field that
included Wiener, former party official Ron Brown, and former Reps.
Michael Barnes of Maryland and Jim Jones of Oklahoma.
   Brown was convention manager for Jesse Jackson, and much of the
opposition to him appeared based on his tie to the longtime civil
rights leader.

   Kirk warned the Democrats not to ``rush to pick up sides and
divide among ourselves _ region against region, left against right,
constituency against constituency.''
   Despite Bush's 40-state victory in the presidential election,
Kirk said, ``There is no Republican majority in America's city halls
or its legislative bodies. There is no Republican majority of
governors.
   ``There is no Republican House. There is no Republican Senate.
There is no Republican realignment. And there is no Republican
mandate.''
   He urged his party to ``take prudent stock of the factors that
might have improved our chances in this election. We should not
oversimplify, but we must not overreact. ...
   ``Should we fall into the trap of thinking we must change
everything we've done in order to win the next presidential
election? I say no.''

   The choice of Atwater was the main topic of conversation at a
breakfast meeting of Southern party chairs.
   ``I don't intend to get out-muscled,'' said Slagle. ``I don't
intend to let them play that kind of game with us and win it. If we
have to sink to their level to protect democracy and to break them
of sucking eggs then I'm perfectly willing to do it.''
   Slagle said he would urge Democrats to undertake thorough checks
of the backgrounds of Republican candidates in order to retaliate
against GOP attacks on Democrats.

   Some kids tweaked Mickey's nose
Friday and others sang ``It's a Small World'' in Russian, German or
English when more than 4,000 children joined in celebrating the 60th
birthday of the famous Walt Disney mouse.
   ``Next to winning the hockey championship at school, this is the
best thing that's happened to me in my life,'' said 10-year-old
Christopher Leitao of Boston.
   Vitaly Yakimov, 9, from Moscow, said the best part was that
``everybody smiles, the children and adults, everybody.''
   Shortly after noon, in groups of 10 to 100, specially invited
children _ many of them poor or from foster homes _ from 116 U.S.
cities and several other nations assembled for a parade from
Cinderella's Castle down Main Street to town square in the Magic
Kingdom.
   Decked out in brightly colored Disney T-shirts and mouse-ear
hats, youngsters ranging in age from 8 to 12 marched behind Mickey
and Minnie Mouse. They waved and sang ``M-I-C-K-E-Y'' along with the
band as they became the center of attention for the tourist crowds
in sunny, 80-degree weather.
   Mickey Mouse's day-long party celebrated the squeaky-voiced
character's debut Nov. 18, 1928, at the Colony Theater in New York
City in ``Steamboat Willie,'' the first cartoon to have sound
synchronized with the pictures.
   ``People who saw Mickey Mouse in his heyday during the Depression
saw that he had so many of the foibles that they had, and was
striving to get ahead in the world just like them,'' said Disney
archivist David Smith. ``People looked up to this mouse.''
   Friday's festivities also included a global sing-along of the
``Mickey Mouse Club March,'' the famous theme song that spells out
Mickey's name, on radio stations around the world. Disney said
broadcasters on every continent and at the North and South poles
played the 12-line classic at 9:50 a.m. EST.
   Most of the children were selected by mayors or officials of
social service organizations in their communities. Some were from
foster homes, many came from poor families and most never had an
opportunity to visit Disney parks or similar attractions.
   Disney threw a similar party for an equal number of children at
Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.
   After their march the youngsters became the spectators for a
special Mickey's Birthday Parade of Disney characters, bands, horses
and floats.
   A favorite was Goofy riding a Palomino pony. Mickey was on a
riverboat float. Donald and Daisy Duck rode on a vehicle decked out
as a Southern plantation and impersonated Rhett Butler and Scarlet
O'Hara from the movie ``Gone With the Wind.''
   A group from Lakeview and Michigan elementary schools in nearby
St. Cloud shouted out in unison: ``Mickey's cute.'' One little girl,
too shy to give her name, said: ``I like having to fix his tie.''
   Later, all of the youngsters took places around banquet tables
arranged in the shape of a huge ``M'' that held what Disney billed
as the world's longest birthday cake _ 12 inches wide and 1,000 feet
long.
   Each partygoer cut his own slice of cake, which took 1,235
one-pound boxes of cake mix and 1,850 pounds of icing. Disney chefs
said they also used 3,712 eggs, 20 gallons of vegetable oil and 121
gallons of water to make the cake batter weighing almost 1{ tons.
   The Magic Kingdom was to be closed to tourists after dark so that
the partygoers would have the park all to themselves.
   Ten orphans from the Soviet Union joined children from several
cities in Europe, Canada, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.
   One youngster from Moscow played a guitar, and he and his friends
often broke out in the birthday song and ``Small World'' in their
native language.
   The Soviet children presented Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner
and Ron Allen, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines, with
gifts, including a Russian tea service and a cartoon of Misha the
Russian bear greeting Mickey.
   Disney and Delta shared all the costs of the event.
   Among the foreign cities represented were Dublin and Limerick in
Ireland; Frankfurt and Munich, West Germany; Toronto and Montreal,
Canada; Nassau, Bahamas; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and London, Moscow
and Paris.

   A bomb exploded today outside a building housing
the Geneva office of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, and officials said
five people were injured, including two American women.
   Four of the people, including one of the Americans, were
seriously injured in what one witness described as a bloodbath on
the crowded downtown street.
   Geneva police spokesman Marcel Vaudroz said that aside from the
59-year-old and 22-year-old American tourists, the victims were a
34-year-old Italian man, a 60-year-old French woman and a
21-year-old French man.
   He declined to provide their names.
   He said the younger U.S. woman was released from the hospital
after treatment for shock.
   The injured were passers-by, an Aeroflot employee said.
   Police said the bomb, hidden in a trash can, went off at 4:30
p.m. in front of the building which also houses two Arab banks, a
French bank and a jewelry store.
   Less than three hours after the blast, an anonymous caller to
French-language Swiss television in Geneva claimed the attack in the
name of a Socialist Nationalist Front, the television station
reported on its nightly news broadcast. It quoted the caller as
saying the movement opposed communist, capitalist and Jewish
interests.
   The doorman of a luxury hotel on the same block said, ``First I
heard a loud explosion, like a cannon shot.''
   The large front window of the Aeroflot office shattered and
people screamed, witnesses said. Police arrived 30 seconds after the
blast.
   ``On the sidewalk in front of the office there was a bloodbath,''
said the hotel doorman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At least one traffic light was damaged by the explosion, and
police blocked off two lanes of the four-lane avenue, further
snarling rush-hour traffic.
   Geneva hospital spokesman Louis Ody said five victims were
admitted to the hospital, four of them in serious condition with leg
wounds and burns.
   The bombing was under investigation, officials said.

<HEAD>Students Begin Rabies Shots After Evicted Bat Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was funny for a while _ muscle-bound
athletes at the University of Central Florida gym frightened by
dive-bombing bats that everybody said were harmless.
   But when one of the bats died, tests showed it had rabies.
   Thirteen people have begun a series of rabies shots because of
their handling or otherwise coming into contact with the
sparrow-like, 1-ounce bats or their droppings. The series of five
shots is administered over 28 days.
   Several workers said Thursday that the gym is still infested with
bats.
   University and Orange County health officials are looking for
anyone else who came in contact with the hundreds of creatures that
fluttered in and out of the gym building for weeks after being
displaced in late October from their nests in its ceiling.
   Officials stressed that chances are remote of contracting rabies,
an infectious disease of the central nervous system characterized by
choking, convulsions and inability to swallow liquids.
   ``Just the same, we don't take chances with rabies,'' said Howard
Schwadron, environmental health director for the county health
department.
   The bat that died had been injured and was being cared for by an
unidentified student.
   ``We haven't had these bats attacking people and biting them or
scratching them,'' said Dr. John Langdon, UCF Health Center
director. ``These bats aren't aggressive at all. It's people's own
recklessness.''
   Because bats lick their skin much the way cats do, their fur can
get wet with rabies-infected saliva, and that's why county officials
advised the student and maintenance workers who had handled the
injured creature to get the shots.

   Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, ruler of this once
hermit-like Arab state, on Friday marked the 18th anniversary of the
``renaissance'' that began when he ousted his despotic father and
thrust Oman into the 20th century.
   Since Qaboos deposed his father, Sultan Said Bin Taimur, in a
bloodless palace coup July 23, 1970, this Kansas-sized nation on the
rim of the Persian Gulf has been transformed from one of the world's
most backward countries into a burgeoning modern state.
   Sultan Said, a traditionalist who had ruled since 1932, kept Oman
in the Dark Ages. Despite the discovery of oil in 1964, he banned
schools, radios, music, dancing, spectacles and even trousers and
books in an attempt to keep the 20th century at bay.
   Said also virtually banned foreigners, allowing in only those
whose visas he personally authorized.
   There were only a few miles of paved road and 15 telephones in
the country. The gates of the old walled city of Muscat, little
changed since the 15th century, were locked at night and strangers
risked being shot on sight.
   Now, with help from Oman's modest oil revenues, Qaboos has built
a thriving nation with nearly 2,000 miles of highways, nearly 700
schools and other educational centers, 130 hospitals and clinics and
a development plan aimed at building a diversified ecis is a test. This
is only a test.

<TEXT>
   Five years after a surgeon removed a supposedly
inoperable brain tumor and sent a New York City boy home to a normal
life, the 13-year-old has survived another frightening diagnosis and
a second round of surgery, his doctor said Friday.
   ``I would describe Tom as very courageous,'' said Dr. George
Dorhmann. ``He's been through more in his 13 years than most people
go through in their lifetime ... a very deep dangerously removed
tumor. And he's been through this, the scare of a tumor ... that's
going to grow and make (him) paralzyed.
   ``I would say he is someone who's handled all of this as well as
most people would be able to do.''
   What doctors first feared was another life-threatening tumor
turned out to be a herniated disc in Thomas Biesiadecki's lower
back, and the boy is on the mend again after a successful operation
at the University of Chicago Medical Center.
   ``I'm thankful that God gave him back to me a second time,''
Barbara Biesiadecki, Thomas' mother, said shortly before he was sent
home Friday.
   No one was more relieved than Thomas, who after reaching the
important five-year medical milestone had finally stopped fearing
his brain tumor would reappear, his mother said. He even had a party
to celebrate.
   But then the pain returned. Thomas first noticed an ache in his
stomach while delivering newspapers one day in September. Doctors in
New York thought it was a pulled muscle, Mrs. Biesiadecki recalled,
and she made him quit his paper route.
   But the pain persisted, radiating to his back and down his leg.
An X-ray showed a mass in his lower back, Mrs. Biesiadecki said.
Doctors, fearing another tumor, told Thomas and his family that
radiation therapy should be started.
   ``He was very upset,'' Mrs. Biesiadecki said. ``His only thought
was that it was back again ... I think the worst part of seeing my
son sick, aside from the pain he was in, was seeing how sad and
empty he was.''
   But she refused to accept defeat.
   The family had consulted doctors first in 1983, when Thomas began
suffering memory lapses and headaches. The doctors diagnosed an
inoperable tumor growing deep inside his brain.
   But Mrs. Biesiadecki learned through a newspaper article about a
doctor in Chicago who performed brain surgery with ultrasound, a
procedure using high-frequency sound. She contacted the doctor,
Dohrmann, at the University of Chicago, and he operated on Thomas a
short time later.
   A non-cancerous, marble-sized tumor was removed and the operation
was declared a success.
   Follow-up brain scans showed no recurrence, and Thomas was
considered normal, except for a related learning disability that has
put him a couple of grades behind his peers, his mother said.
   Mrs. Biesiadecki turned once again to Dohrman befo2e consen4ing
to radiation for Thomas' back problem.
   ``I said with that location there's no question with modern
techniques we could get just a piece of this tumor,'' Dohrmann said,
recalling a phone conversation with the family.
   But after looking at the boy's X-rays, Dohrmann decided Thomas
didn't have a tumor after all. Instead, he found a disc herniation,
a condition that is not unusual in adults but is rare in children,
he said.
   Discs are the cushion-like tissue between each vertebra that give
the back its mobility. In Thomas' case, the jelly-like material
inside one of his discs was pushing on sensitive nerves, Dohrmann
explained.
   He said the problem was unrelated to Thomas' tumor.
   Disc fragments were removed in a fairly uncomplicated operation
Nov. 9. Now Thomas' prognosis is ``excellent,'' Dohrmann said.
   The diagnosis was a miracle to the Biesiadecki family.
   ``I just think that something must be very special about Thomas,
that this happened to him a second time,'' Mrs. Biesiadecki said.
   ``We can't wait to go home.''

   Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in the
two months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palace
official was quoted as saying Friday.
   The 87-year-old emperor's condition weakened Friday, but doctors
speculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upper
intestinal area, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji
Maeda.
   Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not
discharged blood in nine days.
   The emperor responds to queries from aides but is ``less
talkative than before,'' Maeda told reporters. He added that doctors
sometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake.
   News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of his
normal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66
pounds.
   Hirohito had a temperature of 99.1 degrees Friday evening, up
slightly from the morning. His normal temperature is about 95.9
degrees.
   Doctors have said he suffers from jaundice and anemia. Maeda said
the emperor's heart and kidneys were functioning normally.
   Since Sept. 19, when he was confined to intensive care after
vomiting blood, Hirohito has received 42 pints of blood in
transfusions.
   Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness,
and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor
has pancreatic cancer.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met Friday
with James A. Baker III, his designated successor, on transition
issues at the State Department as well as preparations for the visit
to New York next month of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Shultz and Baker had talked over the telephone and at various
functions in the last few days, but this was their first
``substantive discussion'' of foreign policy, said a U.S. official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shultz and Baker had lunch in the James Monroe Room, the
secretary of state's private dining room. They made no statements to
reporters.
   Before the meeting, Shultz spoke to a group of Soviet and
American mayors, telling them that progress in U.S.-Soviet relations
had produced ``a different atmosphere around the world.''
   He said that ``there are still many problems between us, and
there are others we have resolved.'' Shultz took no questions from
his audience.
   Shultz welcomed President-elect George Bush's selection of Baker
last week and said of his prospective successor: ``He will hit the
ground running.''
   Baker has a broad background in international economics and close
personal ties to Bush.
   Among the issues that will carry over to the new administration
are arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union, the
Arab-Israeli dispute, the suspended Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan and negotiations to establish Namibia as an independent
state in Africa while removing Cuban troops from Angola.
   President Reagan and Bush plan to meet Dec. 7 with Gorbachev over
lunch at the Metropolitan Museum of Art during the Soviet leader's
trip to the United Nations. Shultz will fly to Brussels afterward to
brief the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.

<HEAD>NAB Says Federal Drunk Driving Panel Stacked Against Beer, Wine Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Broadcasters on
Friday charged that a drunken driving workshop coordinated by the
surgeon general's office has a built-in bias against beer and wine
advertising.
   The NAB, in a letter to Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, said
many members of the workshop panels are strong opponents of beer and
wine ads.
   The panels ``are stacked against those groups most affected by
any recommendations,'' NAB said.
   The workshop, billed as part of the Health and Human Services
Department's initiative against alcohol-related problems, is
scheduled to take place Dec. 14-16 in Washington. It is sponsored by
the departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, Education,
Justice and Transportation.
   HHS said the purpose of the workshop was ``to develop a
comprehensive plan to bring drunk driving under control and to
eliminate it as the leading cause of death among young Americans.''
   The NAB, which opposes a prohibition on beer and wine
advertising, said it was invited to participate in a panel on
``advertising and marketing.'' But NAB President Edward O. Fritts
told Koop the group would not participate ``unless your plans are
significantly reshaped to include all legitimate points of view.''
   Jim Brown, a spokesman for Koop, said the office was preparing a
formal response to NAB's complaints, but he said, ``in setting up
the workshop, we tried to involve people from all areas in the
problem of drunk driving, including advertising agencies and sports
complexes.'' He declined, however, to list the participants of the
advertising panel.
   NAB said, however, that most of the 10 people it was told would
be on the advertising panel oppose or have indicated concern about
beer and wine advertising. Missing from their list of panel
participants are major league sports, sporting arenas, the alcohol
beverage industry, advertising agencies, individual broadcast
stations and the broadcast networks, NAB said.
   NAB also said workshop organizers rejected panelists from groups
that support radio and TV anti-drunk driving public service
campaigns and oppose the outright ban of responsible beer and wine
advertising.
   Besides advertising and marketing, a draft of the workshop plan
includes panels on data collection, education, legal issues,
enforcement, alcohol-service policies, injury control, youth,
treatment and citizen advocacy.
   In his letter, Fritts said that as presently constructed, the
workshop would not contribute to the discussion on drunken driving.
   ``At best, this workshop is designed to politicize the emotional
tragedy of drunk driving. At worst, it is a total abuse of the
policy-setting process,'' he said.

   The Angolan government on Friday formally
approved a provisional framework for an eventual pullout of Cuban
troops from Angola and independence for South-West Africa, the
Angolan news agency ANGOP said.
   In a report released in Lisbon, the official news agency said the
government ``approved the results of four-party talks in Geneva,
along with a calendar for the complete, gradual withdrawal of Cuba's
internationalist troops.''
   Cuba has about 50,000 troops in Angola.
   Negotiators from Angola, Cuba and South Africa, under U.S.
mediation, agreed Tuesday in Geneva to submit a timetable to their
respective governments for the redeployment of Cuban troops to the
north of Angola and their ultimate pullout, which could lead to
peace in southern Africa.
   All sides agreed to hold a final round of talks in the Congo
capital of Brazzaville at an unspecified date once the provisional
plan is ratified by the governments, the negotiators said.
   Earlier Friday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said the Cuban
government in Havana also ratified the proposed timetable.
   During the peace talks, which have been held intermittently since
May, South Africa made agreement on a Cuban withdrawal a
precondition for implementing independence plans for South-West
Africa, or Namibia, a territory Pretoria has ruled for 73 years.
   Namibia, which lies between Angola and South Africa, long served
as a base for South African army raids into southern Angola to help
support rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, also known as UNITA.
   UNITA guerrillas have been fighting to force the Marxist-oriented
government in Luanda to share power since shortly after Angola
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Cuban troops arrived in Angola at that time to back government
forces fighting UNITA.
   South Africa withdrew all its troops from Angola to Namibia in
August, as part of a cease-fire agreed on in an earlier round of
talks.
   UNITA, not a party to the talks, does not recognize the
cease-fire and reports of clashes between government and rebel
forces continue to reach Lisbon.

<HEAD>American Cult Leader Seeks Pardon in Guyana</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American fugitive David Hill, the black
power cult leader serving a 20-year prison term for manslaughter,
has asked President Desmond Hoyte for a pardon because of poor
health.
   Hill, who calls himself Rabbi Edward Washington, was admitted to
Georgetown Hospital on Oct. 15 after suffering a stroke that has
left him paralyzed on his right side. He also suffers from diabetes
and high blood pressure and had a mild heart attack in April.
   His House of Israel followers say his condition is worsening and
he is seeking a pardon for his 1986 manslaughter conviction on
humanitarian grounds.
   ``Members of the House of Israel seek the support of all
forgiving men and women and Guyanese of good will to join in an
appeal on humanitarian grounds to President Desmond Hoyte for him to
grant Mr. Washington a pardon,'' said a statement issued Thursday.
   There was no immediate government reaction.
   Hill fled to this English-speaking country on the northern coast
of South America in 1971 after jumping bail in Cleveland on nine
extortion charges.
   Hill set up a commune in Guyana's sparsely populated interior
near Jonestown, where the Rev. Jim Jones and 912 of his Peoples
Temple followers died in a suicide-massacre on Nov. 18, 1978.
   He established close ties with the leftist government of the late
President Forbes Burnham and incurred the wrath of opposition
parties, which accused the cult of breaking up strikes and political
meetings.
   After Burnham's death in 1985, new President Desmond Hoyte
ordered an investigation of the cult, leading to the jailing of Hill
and two others for ordering the killing of a cult member.
   The House of Israel teaches that Jesus Christ was black and
blacks are the true Hebrews. It has no connection with Judaism or
the state of Israel.

<HEAD>Bush Reaches Out to Congress, Governors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush moved Friday to
bolster his relationship with a Congress that could prove testy in
coming months, as he also reached out to governors and worked to
fill jobs on his economic team.
   In the face of a volatile economic climate that has seen declines
in the stock market and a plunge in the dollar's value abroad, Bush
reiterated Friday that he plans to round out his economic
appointments soon and then move on to name his national security
team.
   After a weekend out of the public eye, Bush also plans to meet
Monday with former Presidents Ford and Carter, said sources close to
the president-elect.
   Anticipating what many observers say will be a short
``honeymoon'' before Congress begins to stand up to the Bush White
House on taxes and other issues, Bush and his newly named chief of
staff, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, met for lunch Friday with
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Afterward, Wright, D-Texas, sounded a hopeful note for a working
relationship, telling reporters that Bush will have closer relations
with Congress than did President Reagan.
   He said Bush ``is quite earnestly interested in the realities of
the deficit,'' which is likely to be a bone of contention,
especially given Bush's campaign vow not to raise taxes to cut the
federal budget deficit.
   Bush, on entering the meeting also expressed hopes for good ties,
telling reporters, ``I meant it when I said I want to work closely
with him and members of the House of Representatives, no matter
which side of the aisle they sit on ... I want to get off to a very
good start.''
   Sununu said Bush would communicate directly with Congress to
address the deficit.
   ``I think Congress and the president are going to work
aggressively and quickly to deal with that issue,'' Sununu said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   Bush's transition press secretary, Sheila Tate, said the speaker
had telephoned Bush for a meeting, indicating he would come to the
vice president's office.
   But, according to Tate, Bush offered to go to Capitol HIll
instead, ``as a gesture of him being willing to cooperate and work
with Congress.''
   ``It showed ... he was willing to come halfway, rather than
asking me to go down to the White House,'' Wright said in
acknowledging hte symbolism.
   In what Bush called another symbolic step Friday, the
president-elect met with a group of 18 governors and governors-elect
in Charlottesville, Va..
   He said the purpose was ``to send an early signal to the
governors and the states of my interests in working with the
governors, Democrats and Republicans alike.''
   Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles said the discussion ranged over the
deficit, environment, wetlands policies, education, catastrophic
health coverage and the National Economic Commission, established by
Congress to make recommendations on budget issues.
   Bush told the group he would name his two appointees to the
bipartisan commission in early December, said Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad.
   Asked when to expect more decisions on staff and Cabinet
appointments, Bush told reporters to ``stay tuned.''
   Bush's announcement on Thursday of Sununu as chief of staff and
longtime political strategist Lee Atwater as his choice for chairman
of the Republican National Committee, was followed by the selection
of two of Bush's key campaign strategists for Sununu's staff.
   They are Ed Rogers, 29, Atwater's right-hand man in the Bush
campaign and former deputy political director in the Reagan White
House; and Andrew Card Jr., former special assistant to the
president for intergovernmental affairs who served as a senior
adviser to the Bush campaign.
   Card, 41, is widely mentioned as a possible 1990 gubernatorial
candidate in Massachusetts. Aides to Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis credited him with finding and exploiting some of the
most politically damaging material that contributed to Dukakis loss.
   Meanwhile, former Bush campaign press spokesman Mark Goodin has
been tapped to serve at the RNC under Atwater as director of
communications.
   As for his next staff and Cabinet appointments, Bush said he will
``flesh out the economic side of the house,'' after asking Nicholas
Brady to remain as treasury secretary, and then ``start working on
national security.''
   It was anticipated Bush next week would name former Deputy
Treasury Secretary Richard Darman to head the Office of Management
and Budget.
   Another possible announcement would be Stanford University
economist Michael J. Boskin as chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
   The economic front is considered important in light of bad news
in the international financial world since Bush's election. The
stock market fell and the dollar dropped in value, with many
analysts questioning whether Bush can cut the U.S. trade and budget
deficits.
   Brady said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show Friday that he does not
agree that the shaky stock market and dollar show a lack of
confidence in Bush's ability to overcome the deficit.
   ``The Bush deficit-reduction plan, which is called a flexible
freeze, will work ... I'm confident that things will work out just
fine,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union on Friday recognized the
proclamation of an independent Palestinian state in a careful
gesture to its Arab allies that kept alive recent overtures to
Israel.
   ``Faithful to the fundamental principle of freedom of choice, the
Soviet Union recognizes the proclamation of the Palestinian state,''
First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh told a news
briefing.
   He said the Soviet Union believes a comprehensive settlement of
the Arab-Israeli conflict ``will lead also to the practical
completion of the historic process of creating this state.''
   The statement appeared to signal continued Soviet support for the
Palestine Liberation Organization without alienating Israel by
extending full diplomatic relations to the PLO.
   Czechoslovakia issued a similar statement later that also stopped
short of recognizing the Palestinian state, while East Germany's
state-run news agency said that communist nation had given
recognition to the state.
   Havana radio announced Cuban recognition with the statement:
``Cuba, which always supports the just battle of the Palestinian
people for their rights, expresses its support for the Palestinian
state.''
   Israeli leaders did not publicly comment on Moscow's move except
to say it seemed unclear. But senior officials privately expressed
satisfaction that Moscow had stopped short of outright recognition.
   The statement was subject to varying interpretations in Moscow.
   Musa Mubarak, spokesman for the PLO office in Moscow, said the
statement meant the opening of full diplomatic ties. He said the PLO
would be considered ``like any other government'' in Moscow.
   The PLO has maintained an office in Moscow since 1976.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Boris Savastyanov said the statement
did not entail full diplomatic ties or exchange of diplomats.
   ``That requires additional work,'' he said, adding that he could
not speculate on when such changes would occur.
   Bessmertnykh, asked if the announcement amounted to recognition
of the Palestinian state, said ``in essence'' it did.
   A Western diplomat in Moscow who specializes in Middle East
affairs said the Soviet Union was ``under a lot of pressure from the
Palestinians and their Arab allies to recognize'' the new state.
   ``I think it's a way of slipping out of it,'' said the diplomat,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, a State Department official said privately: ``They
really haven't gone as far as the others on recognition. I think the
Soviets traditionally have been rather conservative. I think they
are making a bow to the PLO without going as far as the others in
recognizing the PLO. They want to appear they are supporting them
without boxing themselves in.''
   The Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, proclaimed statehood Tuesday at its conference in
Algiers, Algeria.
   The move came as the Soviet Union pursues a gradual thaw in
relations with Israel. Moscow broke ties with Jerusalem in 1967
after Israel captured Arab lands in the Middle East war. It has
supported the PLO and called for Israel withdrawal from the occupied
lands.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's leadership, Moscow and Jerusalem
have exchanged low-level delegations and the Soviet Union has
loosened some restrictions on Jewish emigration.
   Nevertheless, Moscow's lack of ties with Israel freezes the
Soviets out of a more influential role in the Middle East like that
of the United States.
   The Soviets support Arab demands for a U.N.-sponsored Middle East
peace conference. Such a forum also would be a way for the Soviets
to increase their influence in the region.
   Bessmertnykh praised the Palestinians for accepting U.N.
Resolution 242, which implicitly recognizes Israel.
   ``The Palestinian leadership has displayed a great deal of
responsibility and realism,'' Bessmertnykh said. ``They have
provided for the creation of their state, but at the same time have
stressed the importance of a Middle East settlement.''
   ``A situation is shaping where all the sides directly involved in
the conflict recognize that the path to peace ... lies through talks
on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and that a
Jewish and Arab state have equal rights to exist in Palestine.''
   East Germany's state-run ADN news agency said a Foreign Ministry
official delivered a note Friday recognizing the Palestinian state
to ``PLO's accredited ambassador'' in East Germany, Isam Kamel Salem.
   The note was delivered by Heinz-Dieter Winter, deputy minister
for foreign affairs, the agency said.
   Other nations that have recognized the Palestinian state are:
Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Cuba, Cyprus, Gambia,
India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nicaragua, North and South Yemen,
Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore, Sudan, Tunisia,
Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>French Peacekeeping Convoy Fired on by Israelis</HEAD>

   An Israeli armored personnel carrier on
Friday fired on a French military convoy belonging to the U.N.
peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, a U.N. officer said.
   An Israeli military spokesman said the army had no reports of
incidents in the area. ``Everything is quiet,'' the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A security source in south Lebanon said there was firing in the
area but it was unclear if it was directed at the convoy.
   The U.N. officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
were no casualties among the 18 French soldiers in the convoy's
three vehicles.
   He said the incident occurred at 6:30 p.m. as the convoy _ a tank
and two jeeps _ was crossing through the western entry point to
Israel's self-declared security zone north of the Israeli-Lebanese
border.
   The officer said the convoy was returning from the southern port
of Tyre to the border town of Naqoura, headquarters of the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL.
   More than 150 UNIFIL soldiers have been killed and 250 wounded
since the 5,800-strong force was deployed in south Lebanon in 1978.
   Israel held onto the 6-to-10-mile deep security zone when it
withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon in June 1985 after a
three-year occupation.
   Israel contends that the enclave, which overlaps with UNIFIL's
operating area in south Lebanon, serves as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla attacks into northern Israel.
   In another development in southern Lebanon on Friday, Palestinian
guerrillas attacked an Israeli army post with rockets and automatic
fire, and a security source said one guerrilla was wounded.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a ``fierce
battle'' started at midday between the attackers and Israeli
soldiers manning the outpost in the hamlet of Kfarshouba near the
western slopes of Mt. Hermon.
   The source said that at least three guerrillas took part in the
attack. It was not immediately known to which faction they belonged.
   ``Around 50 Israeli soldiers are searching the area for the
attackers,'' the source said. He gave no further details.

<TEXT>
   Rampant inflation fueled by war and
natural disaster forced Nicaragua to issue banknotes and coins of
higher value Friday, the government said.
   Unofficial estimates put the annual inflation rate at 10,000
percent. There is no official rate.
   ``The fiscal deficit, produced by the war and aggravated by
Hurricane Joan and accelerated devaluations, have influenced the
issue of money,'' Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling
Sandinista party, said Thursday.
   The new 5,000-cordoba note issued Friday, worth $2.50, is five
times as large as the biggest bill that was in circulaton. Barricada
also said a new, 500-cordoba coin, worth about 25 cents, was being
issued.
   When it was first issued in February as part of a massive
devaluation, the 1,000-cordoba note was worth $100. Today it is
worth 50 cents.
   The leftist Sandinistas inherited a bankrupt nation when they
took power in a 1979 revolution. Dictator Anastasio Somoza took most
of the money in the treasury with him when he was ousted.
   The economy has been further battered by seven years of war with
the U.S.- backed Contra rebels. President Daniel Ortega says the war
has cost Nicaragua $12 billion in direct and indirect costs, such as
lost production and export earnings.
   Hurricane Joan dealt Nicaragua another blow when it swept ashore
Oct. 22, destroying homes, crops, ranches, bridges and roads and
leaving tens of thousands homeless. Ortega has said the storm caused
$828 million in damage.
   The political opposition claims many of the economic problems
stem from Sandinista corruption and mismanagemant.
   The government issued a series of new bills last year that went
up to 50,000 cordobas, which at the time was worth about $2.
   The currency was discontinued in February and the cordoba was
devalued to a rate of 10 to the dollar.
   The official rate for the cordoba on Thursday was 2,000 to the
dollar. The rate used for imports was 500 to the dollar.

   Rusty Wallace, still hoping to overtake Bill
Elliott in the battle for the Winston Cup title, buried the Atlanta
International Raceway qualifying record Friday as he took the pole
for the season-ending Atlanta Journal 500.
   Wallace drove his Pontiac Grand Prix to a fast lap of 179.499
mph, well above the previous track mark of 176.623 set in March by
Geoff Bodine in qualifying for the Motorcraft 500.
   That sizzling lap on the newly-paved 1.522-mile, high-banked oval
also was more than 2 mph faster than the 177.125 mph turned in by
Wallace's closest pursuer and close friend Dale Earnhardt in a
Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
   ``I should have gone a little faster in turns one and two,'' said
Earnhardt, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion. ``But we're
ready. Right now, the car is good enough to race.''
   Seven driver bettered the old record on Friday in nearly perfect
weather conditions _ sunny, cool and nearly windless.
   Brett Bodine, Geoff's younger brother, was third at 177.177,
followed by Mike Alexander at 177.125, Ricky Rudd at 177.068, Geoff
Bodine at 176.880 and Ken Schrader at 176.794.
   Fifty-one cars made one-lap qualifying efforts on Friday, with
the top 20 locking in starting spots for Sunday's 500-mile race. The
rest of the 40-car field will be filled in another session of time
trials on Saturday.
   One of the drivers still trying to earn a starting position is
Elliott, who was a disappointing 22nd on Friday at 174.452.
   The Dawsonville, Ga., driver is the defending champion in this
race and had started no worse than 10th here in 16 races dating back
to November, 1980.
   Elliott, who will clinch his first Winston Cup championship
Sunday if he finishes 19th or better, no matter what Wallace does,
said his poor qualifying effort on what he considers his home track
surprised him.
   ``I don't know what happened, but I was only a second off Rusty's
time,'' Elliott said. ``It could have been worse.
   ``Starting in the middle of the pack can be tough because you
never know what's going to happen back there,'' he added. ``But you
can have a flat tire at the start of the race and wind up back
there, too. That's just something you have to deal with in the
race.''
   Wallace, who knows his only chance to overcome Elliott's 79-point
lead going into Sunday's race is to do well and have the leader
falter, said, ``Basically, I think we're ready to go. We tested here
'til we wore everything out last week.
   ``We know we've got to do everything. We want to win the pole,
lead every lap, win the race and then stand back and see where we
stand.''
   Also among the drivers failing to qualifying among the top 20 on
Friday were Benny Parsons and Cale Yarborough, a pair of former
Winston Cup champions who have announced their retirement as drivers
following this event.
   Parsons was 26th at 174.181, while Yarborough was 34th at 173.387.

   A bomb exploded in a trash basket at the beginning
of rush hour Friday, wounding five pedestrians outside a building
that houses the Soviet airline Aeroflot and several banks, police
reported.
   They said three of the victims were in serious condition.
   Two French nationals, two American tourists and an Italian
resident of Geneva were hospitalized after the explosion at 4:20
p.m. Their identities were withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   A 59-year-old American had serious leg injuries and burns and the
other American, a 22-year-old woman, was released after treatment of
ear problems, police reported.
   Police spokesman Marcel Vaudroz said there was no immediate
indication of the bomb's target and authorities were preparing a
composite portrait of a person seen earlier near the wire basket,
which was mounted on a lightpost.
   Vaudroz said security measures were increased after the
explosion, but would not elaborate.
   The Federal Prosecutor's Office, which has jurisdiction over
crimes involving explosives, also was investigating.
   An anonymous caller to a television station in Geneva about three
hours later claimed responsibility in the name of the ``Socialist
Nationalist Front.'' The caller said communists, capitalists and
Jews were the target, the station reported on its nightly newscast.
   Vaudroz said police had not heard of the organization and
indicated they questioned the claim's validity. He said explosives
experts were examining the ``pulverized'' remains of the bomb.
   The blast shattered the front window of the Aeroflot office on
Quai du Mont Blanc, but an Aeroflot employee said no one inside was
hurt.
   Police closed off the area for several hours, causing traffic
problems throughout the city.

   Alabama NAACP President Thomas Reed was
sentenced Friday to four years in federal prison for taking a
$10,000 bribe, a ruling that instantly removes him from his seat in
the state Legislature.
   ``The victim of crimes in this case is the public,'' U.S.
District Judge Joel Dubina told Reed.
   The judge said Reed, 60, had developed a trust with the public
during his five terms in office, but ``gave away that trust for a
small amount of money.''
   ``You used your power ... to line your pockets,'' Dubina told
Reed, convicted of taking cash in exchange for trying to help a
murderer win early release.
   ``Judge, I know I'm not guilty,'' said Reed, who in 1970 became
one of the first two blacks elected to the Alabama Legislature.
   Dubina commended Reed for his legislative and civil rights work,
his educational background, business success and 40-year marriage.
He then sentenced Reed to four years in prison on one extortion
count and three years on another, with the sentences to run
concurrently. A $100 court charge also was assessed.
   Both the prosecution and defense called the sentence fair, but
U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said the term was ``a little stiffer than
we were thinking it would be.''
   Reed was convicted of taking $10,000 from Columbus, Ga.,
businessman Bobby Gene Chesser. Prosecutors said the money was in
exchange for Reed's attempt to win an early release from prison for
Chesser's nephew, Anthony Dennis Chesser, serving a 40-year sentence
in the murder of his wife.
   The charges against Reed carried a maximum penalty of 25 years in
federal prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Dubina ordered Reed to report to prison on Jan. 3 but allowed him
to remain free on bond. One of Reed's attorneys, Bill Baxley,
indicated he would seek a court order allowing Reed to remain free
while the case is appealed.
   Baxley said he was confident the verdict would be overturned,
with Reed eventually returning to his position in the state House.

   The government agreed Friday to not send
13 Cuban detainees back to their homeland until after their
attorneys have a chance to study administrative files in Washington.
   ``We shouldn't deport anybody until we get the records, should
we?'' asked U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon at an informal hearing
on a request for a preliminary injunction against the Justice
Department.
   The request for a restraining order claimed the Cubans had been
denied political asylum ``without a full or adequate opportunity to
establish their persecution claims.'' It claimed they were entitled
to a hearing before an immigration judge.
   ``If deported to Cuba, they will suffer irreparable harm,''
lawyers Leo Ochoa and Robert L. Boyer of Miami said in their request.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George C. Batcheler promised that no
deportation efforts will be made until the records arrive.
   Clemon postponed the hearing indefinitely.
   ``We'll wait until we are notified by the U.S. attorney that the
records have arrived,'' said Leo Ochoa, an attorney for the Cubans.
``We're not in as big a hurry as the government.''
   The 13 are among 110 deportable Cubans at the Federal
Correctional Institution at Talladega, about 60 miles east of
Birmingham. They were among 125,000 people who came to the United
States from Mariel, Cuba, in 1980 in the so-called ``Freedom
Flotilla'' boatlift; many of them had criminal records or mental
illness.
   The government served notice Thursday on 15 Cubans at Talladega
that they would be deported within 72 hours. The 15 have been
convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder,
the Justice Department said in a statement.
   Ochoa said two of the 15 had not asked him to represent them.
   Three-member repatriation review panels set up by the Jstice
Department have reviewed the cases of 28 Cubans and recommended that
the 15 be returned home. The panels were created after last year's
prison riots by Cuban detainees at Atlanta and Oakdale, La.,
triggered by an agreement with Cuban President Fidel Castro to
resume sending many of the detainees home.
   The review panels will make further reviews of the remaining 13
of the 28 to determine if they should be deported or released.
   At Miami, meanwhile, members of the Cuban community appealed to
President Reagan to block the deportation.
   Rafael Penalver, who heads a task force aimed at protecting the
detainees, asked the Reagan administration to consider the wishes of
some of its staunchest supporters.
   ``In the waning days of the Reagan presidency, we are making an
appeal to the president not to leave as one of his legacies the
commencement of the deportation process of Cuban exiles to Fidel
Castro's hands,'' Penalver said.
   Penalver said the prisoners have completed their sentences and
are being unjustly deported only because they arrived on the Mariel
boatlift.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has released on parole
about 2,400 of 3,822 detainees. Another 400 have been approved for
parole and are awaiting release, said INS spokesman Duke Austin.
Those denied parole received a special review.

   The glitter of a bygone era is re-emerging from
the dust and neglect of time as the Fox Theater reopens Saturday.
   Singers Smokey Robinson, Billy Eckstein and Hall & Oates will be
featured in a show Saturday celebrating the reopening of the theater
that underwent $8.1 million in restoration work.
   The Count Basie Orchestra, magician Harry Blackstone and
Detroit-born comedian Dave Coulier also will perform in the
5,100-seat theater that was called a ``temple of amusement'' when it
first opened in 1928.
   ``I'm amazed that we've taken the Fox this far,'' said Ray
Shepardson, a theater consultant. ``It not only looks like 1928, it
is 1928.''
   In the theater's early years, a children's dancing school was run
from the Fox and promoter Bennie Davis ran a talent revue nightly
from the huge stage.
   Shows at 2 a.m. were held during World War II for the night-shift
workers at war plants, and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed six
shows a day during a stint at the Fox in 1951.
   But in the following years, the prestige of the Fox began
slipping, and the building began having problems. While the Fox
remained structurally sound, its roof leaked, the carpeting was
badly worn and electrical systems needed improvement.
   All that has been fixed, and new owner Mike Ilitch is putting
headquarters for his Little Caesar International pizza company in a
10-story office building next to the Fox in downtown Detroit. The
theater and office building are expected to key a major
redevelopment of the area.
   Inside the theater, marble-looking pillars actually are plaster.
Gold on sculptures actually is aluminum and the carpet patterns are
injected rather than woven in.
   But that doesn't bother a lot of people.
   ``Who cares that the Fox is all fake and fraud,'' said Audley
Grossman, curator of performing arts at the Detroit Institute of
Arts. ``It's truly a palace with a sense of opulence and fun.''

Talks</HEAD>

   Differences with France and the Soviet Union
have upset U.S. plans to begin talks this year between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact on reducing non-nuclear forces in Europe, a senior
Reagan aministration official said Friday.
   The dispute with France concerns whether European governments
outside the two alliances should play a significant role in troop
reduction decisions.
   France insists on a 35-nation review in 1992, which might lead to
a suspension of negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Warsaw Pact if governments outside the
alliances were dissatisfied with the results.
   The disagreement with the Soviet Union is over U.S. conditions
for a human rights conference the Soviets want to hold in Moscow.
These include further easing of restrictions on emigration and
freeing all political prisoners.
   Despite progress on both fronts, the State Department does not
consider the conditions met.
   As a result, the senior official said, ``almost certainly'' the
negotiations over reducing troops, tanks and anti-aircraft artillery
in Europe will not open this year.
   At one point, the Reagan administration had hoped the
negotiations would begin by year's end. ``Not anymore,'' said the
official, who spoke to a reporter on condition of anonymity.
   The negotiations were seen as a way around 15 years of
unproductive talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on troop
reductions in Central Europe.
   The United States and the Soviet Union also agreed to expand the
area to stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the
Soviet Union.
   France, which participates in NATO's political decisions but
remains outside the alliance's military command, had wanted all
European nations to play a role in troop reduction decisions. But
France accepted a compromise last year at a North Atlantic Council
meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, that the negotiations be held among
the 23 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact within the context of the
35-nation European Security Conference.
   But now, the U.S. official said, France is insisting that the 35
countries _ 33 in Europe along with the United States and Canada _
meet in 1992 to assess progress in the negotiations.
   This raises U.S. concerns that the conference could decide to
suspend the negotiations.
   The dispute with the Soviets, meanwhile, is holding up completion
in Vienna of a review of the Helsinki Agreement concluded by the 35
nations in 1975. It provided for a freer exchange of people and
ideas across the East-West divide while not interfering with the
post-war boundaries that gave the Soviets more authority in Eastern
Europe.

<TEXT>
   Lee Atwater, tapped by President-elect George
Bush to take over the Republican National Committee, said Friday
that the party will start work immediately on the 1990 campaign.
   ``There's all kinds of races going on,'' Atwater noted, saying he
especially wants to start recruiting for the midterm congressional
elections.
   While the Republicans have captured the White House in five of
the last six elections, they have not been able to gain control of
Congress. All of the House and one-third of the Senate seats are up
in 1990.
   The Republican National Committee meets in January to pick a new
chairman to succeed Frank Fahrenkopf, and Bush's endorsement
virtually guarantees that Atwater will be elected.
   Atwater, who managed Bush's campaign, said he has started making
peace with the other Republicans who ran for the party's
presidential nomination.
   Two of those candidates, television evangelist Pat Robertson and
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, were especially critical
of Atwater during the campaign and accused him of underhanded
tactics.
   Atwater said he spoke to Robertson on the telephone Friday, and
characterized the conversation as ``good.''
   Dole is out of the country.
   Atwater said he plans to launch a program to recruit more blacks,
Hispanics and Asians to join the party, but he did not specify how
this would be carried out. GOP leaders for years have said they want
more minorities to become Republicans, but so far that has not
happened.
   Joining Atwater at the news conference was Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., who hired him as an intern in his Senate office a decade ago.
   Thurmond praised Atwater as a ``keen political analyst, and he is
an outstanding strategist.''

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former city official on Frida was placed
on three years' probation and fined $100,000 for his role in a
teen-age prostitution ring.
   Roger Boas, who as chief administrative officer ran the city for
10 years under two mayors, also was ordered to spend six months on
work detail.
   Boas, 67, was named in an 87-count grand jury indictment Oct. 3
that named 13 other alleged patrons and operators of the brothel. He
pleaded guilty to seven counts of statutory rape in exchange for the
dismissal of 12 counts of having unlawful sex with a minor.
   Boas will serve no time behind bars as long as he participates in
the alternative work program. He also must continue to undergo
counseling and cooperate with authorities in the ongoing
investigation of the prostitution operation.
   ``I feel sadness for everyone affected,'' Boas said. ``I will
serve my sentence and pay my debt to society and try to put this
tragedy behind me and my family. I will then do my utmost to be a
responsible, worthwhile citizen.''
   Boas was included in the investigation after one of the teen-age
prostitutes spotted a Boas campaign poster and recognized his face.
He was running for mayor at the time.
   The indictments stemmed from a 16-month police probe during which
five prostitutes testified they had sex with Boas.
   The charges covered 2{ years that included Boas' final 15 months
as the city's chief administrative officer and his 1987 mayoral
campaign. He finished third in last year's primary.
   Superior Court Judge Timothy A. Reardon called Boas' crimes
``unquestionably reprehensible.''
   He cited several factors he took into account when sentencing
Boas, including Boas' age, lack of a criminal record, former public
service and his ``obvious remorse ... and the public embarrassment
and humiliation'' the crimes brought to Boas and his family.
   Boas, who is married and has four children, left the courtroom
after sentencing without speaking to reporters.
   Boas had faced a maximum of three years on each of the felony
counts of statutory rape. He was ordered to appear Dec. 7 to receive
instructions on the sheriff's alternative work program, which
typically involves public clean-up and gardening chores.

   The focus of the executive order, initially issued by
then-President Richard Nixon, concerns the ``prudent measures'' that
federal agencies can take during a military attack, natural disaster

   The executive order, however, does not get into responsibilities

<HEAD>USGS Finds Hints Of Renewed Activity Beneath Medicine Lake Volcano</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A swarm of microearthquakes and
discovery of a possible underground pool of molten rock provide
hints that California's dormant Medicine Lake Volcano might be
reawakening, scientists said Friday.
   However, there is no evidence an eruption is likely, U.S.
Geological Survey scientists said.
   ``It's suspicious enough to put in a new network (of seismic
monitors) but not suspicious enough to cause alarm,'' said John R.
Evans, a seismologist at the agency's western regional headquarters.
   ``If you identify a zone of molten magma beneath a volcano, that
obviously increases the potential for some future activity,'' said
geologist Bob Tilling, who headed the agency's response to the 1980
eruptions of Mount St. Helens. ``There's no evidence now for any
eruption at all. The only prudent thing is to keep monitoring it.''
   The evidence is ambiguous, so it's ``premature to suggest it
represents a reawakening of the volcano,'' said C. Dan Miller, a
geologist with the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory.
   Medicine Lake Volcano is a gently sloped volcano, about 20 miles
in diameter, in the southern Cascade Range about 35 miles northeast
of Mount Shasta, 60 miles north of Lassen Peak and roughly 280 miles
northeast of San Francisco. Medicine Lake, a recreational lake, sits
at an elevation of 6,674 feet on the floor of the volcano's
four-by-seven-mile crater, called a caldera.
   The nearest town, Tulelake, Calif., is 25 miles to the northeast.
   The volcano last erupted about 850 to 875 years ago, forming
small lava flows and cinder cones around several volcanic vents,
Miller said. Between 1,200 and 875 years ago, it had several
explosive eruptions, he said.
   Evans said the recent quakes, detection of the possible magma
chamber and a slight drop in the elevation of the caldera floor in
recent months may indicate magma is moving inside the mountain. But
Miller and Evans agreed the quakes also could have been caused by
non-volcanic stretching of the Earth's crust.
   The USGS installed six new seismometers after the single previous
seismometer detected a swarm of about 200 earthquakes Sept. 29 and
30, Evans said. Before then, only one earthquake, in October 1986,
had been detected at the volcano since the agency started monitoring
in 1981, geologist Steve Walter said.
   The September quakes were shallow and most were microearthquakes
measuring less than 2 on the Richter scale. Four exceeded magnitude
3, including one jolt that reached 4.2, Walter said. Three other
small quakes occurred Oct. 26 and Nov. 11 and 12, he added.
   Evidence for the small magma chamber just northeast of the lake
was found by Evans and geophysicists H. Mahadeva Iver and Phil
Dawson, using the shock xwaves of small explosions to make a picture
of the inside of the volcano.
   They found an area in which shock waves moved slowly, suggesting
they had moved through magma, Evans said. However, Miller said it
also is possible the waves were slowed by porous rock permeated by
hot water.
   The quakes ``may have recorded the intrusion of new magma into
this part of the volcano,'' Evans, Iyer and Dawson said in a study
presented at their agency's Geohazards '88 symposium
   The possible magma pool is small, measuring only about two cubic
miles, compared with a volume of about 200 cubic miles for the magma
chamber believed to be beneath the Long Valley caldera near Mammoth
Lakes, Calif., Evans said.
   Walter and Evans said USGS scientist Dan Dzurisin measured the
elevation of benchmarks on the volcano before the quakes, and found
the mountain had ``deflated'' by seven inches since the last
measurements in 1954. After the September quakes, it had fallen an
additional one-third inch.
   Such deflation suggests magma may have moved outward into cracks
in surrounding rocks, Evans said.
   A much higher level of such activity at Long Valley, along with
much bigger swarms of quakes in the early 1980s, failed to result in
any eruption there, Miller and Tilling said.

<HEAD>Lithuania Drops Plans To Duplicate Estonia's Challenge to Kremlin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian parliament on Friday dropped plans
to duplicate Estonia's challenge to Moscow's authority after a high
official said Estonia was violating the Soviet constitution,
official media reported.
   The Estonian parliament on Wednesday passed a declaration of
sovereignty and a constitutional amendment giving its own parliament
the right to veto Soviet laws.
   Many people watching the televised session of the Lithuanian
parliament Friday believed the Lithuanian Communist Party chief,
Algirdas Brazauskas, said in his speech that Moscow had ordered
Estonia's parliament to rescind its actions, said Vitaltas
Kvetkauskas of Lithuanian TV in a telephone interview.
   But another official, Vitautas Astrauskas, appeared on television
later to say these people had misunderstood the speech, Kvetkauskas
continued. He declined to speculate whether the deputies also
misunderstood the speech given by Brazauskas, a reformer appointed a
month ago to replace a member of the Communist Party old guard.
   ``People were scandalized!'' when parliament dropped the
sovereignty idea without a vote, said one activist who had stood on
the square outside all day listening to the live radio broadcast of
the parliament meeting.
   The man was among those who cheered earlier in the day, when
parliament voted to make Lithuanian the official language and the
flag of independent Lithuania the official flag of the Soviet
Lithuanian republic.
   ``The people trusted them, and then they didn't even vote!'' said
the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said Brazauskas returned from Moscow the night before the
meeting and told deputies there was no reason to confront Moscow
when Estonia already had lost the battle over sovereignty.
   The Soviet Presidium said Thursday that Estonia's claim of veto
power over Soviet laws conflicted with the Soviet constitution, and
that the issue would be discussed with Estonian leaders at the next
meeting of the Presidium. No date was given.
   The three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were
independent after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until 1940. They
then were absorbed by the Soviet Union under a secret agreement
between dictators Josef Stalin of the Soviet UNion and Adolf Hitler
of Nazi Germany that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of
influence.
   The three republics have been showing signs of resurgent
nationalism, using President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms to push
for greater autonomy.
   Estonia's President Arnold Ruutel and Premier Indrek Toome were
in Moscow Thursday, but said they were attending a long-planned
meeting on economics.
   After Brazauskas' speech, the Lithuanian parliament voted
unanimously to create a commission to rewrite the entire Lithuanian
Constitution and named Brazauskas as its chairman, according to
Lithuanian journalists and activists.
   Activist Alvydas Medalinskas said in a telephone interview that
he understood Brazauskas to say Moscow ``sent an order to the
Estonian parliament demanding a special session for Saturday'' to
rescind its declaration of sovereignty.
   Medalinskas said he spoke with several members of the Estonian
parliament by telephone Friday night, and they knew nothing about a
special session.
   ``It is a falsification,'' Medalinskas concluded.
   In fact, Estonian newspapers on Friday published the text of
their republic's declaration of sovereignty and new constitutional
amendments passed two days earlier, said Peter Paldre, an editor at
Sovietskaya Estonia.
   Paldre also noted that Toome and Ruutel said nothing about
reversing the move toward sovereignty upon returning to Estonia from
Moscow Friday night.
   Earlier Friday, 1,000 people in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius
watched as the red, green and yellow flag of formerly independent
Lithuania was raised over the Supreme Soviet building, after it was
declared the new flag of the Soviet republic, said editor Vitautus
Makauskas of the official television, which provided a live
broadcast.
   The Lithuanian parliament also agreed to protest proposed
amendments to the Soviet Constitution that residents of the three
tiny Baltic republics say will limit their autonomy, he said.
Makauskas said there were very few dissenting votes.
   In Latvia, 50,000 people gathered in the capital of Riga to mark
the 70th anniversary of Latvian independence, reported Boris Sokolov
of the Democratic Union, a fledgling opposition party.
   The official newspaper of the Russian republic, Sovietskaya
Rossiya, on Friday criticized an effort to make Estonian the
official language of that republic and cited rising tensions between
nationalities there. It picked up a theme sounded by Politburo
member and former KGB secret police chief Viktor M. Chebrikov in a
visit to Estonia last weekend.
   The official news agency Tass also criticized the Estonian move
toward sovereignty Friday.
   On Thursday, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in
Washington: ``The United States does not recognize the forcible
incorporation of the Baltic states. ... The people ... (there) have
been denied their basic human rights.''

<HEAD>Bush Wasn't Only Factor in Dollar's Fall, Economists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was a currency just waiting for a
fall.
   When currency traders began a frenzy of greenback selling
virtually within minutes of George Bush's election, it appeared they
suddenly had discovered the president-elect didn't like taxes and
may have a tough time shrinking the federal budget deficit.
   However, strong skepticism about the ability of Bush, or any
other politician, to address the fundamental causes of the weak
dollar _ the federal budget and U.S. trade deficits _ have been
present since at least midyear.
   The trade imbalance, after shrinking dramatically earlier in the
year, appeared to be approaching a new high. And there was little
hope that the next administration, whether under Bush or Democrat
Michael Dukakis, would offer a realistic plan to reduce the budget
deficit.
   Bush, in particular, appeared to be boxing himself into a corner
with his ``Read my lips: no new taxes'' pledge.
   The real question, according to economist Michael K. Evans, a
consultant in Washington, should be: Why did the dollar rise for the
first eight months of this year?
   He said the dollar held steady because of traders' perception,
rightly or wrongly, that the Federal Reserve and other major central
banks wouldn't let anything roil the markets and spoil the prospect
of a Republican victory on Nov. 8.
   ``Foreign investors were convinced that up until the election the
Federal Reserve would do whatever it takes to keep the dollar
stable. After the election, the sentiment among traders was that the
Fed would not intervene heavily, so the dollar went down. It had
nothing to do with George Bush per se,'' Evans said Friday.
   After the election, currency traders began testing to see how
much of a dollar decline would be tolerated, and the initial
response from central banks, and from Bush advisers, reinforced the
fall.
   ``The intervention in the market appeared to be rather weak.
(Traders) didn't get what the British call `the firm smack of
policy' ... and suddenly they recognized there wasn't an automatic
floor under there,'' said Robert Dederick, an economist with
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   The ``smack'' didn't come until the dollar plunged 5 percent
against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the West German mark,
pulling the U.S. stock and bond markets along with it.
   On Thursday and continuing Friday the Federal Reserve and 10
other central banks intervened with heavy and coordinated dollar
buying. The greenback halted its fall on Thursday and rose slightly
Friday.
   But between the election and Thursday, confusion reigned.
   On the day after the election, Harvard economist Martin
Feldstein, a Bush adviser, restated his often expressed view that
the dollar must fall 20 percent over the next three years. He
emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not Bush, but the
dollar fell after his remarks anyway.
   On Thursday, while commenting on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's warning about the ramifications of not cutting the
budget deficit, Bush transition press secretary Sheila Tate said
``Economists never agree on anything.''
   By Friday, however, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was on
television trying to make calming statements. ``I'm confident that
things will work out just fine'' on the budget deficit, he said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   In Milwaukee, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson,
speaking at a college conference, expressed confidence that the
dollar did not need to fall in order for the trade deficit to keep
improving and that central bank intervention was working.
   But economists said intervention was a temporary check, and they
listed these other factors in the dollar's recent tumble:
   _Dissension on the National Economic Commission, which has been
charged with adopting a politically acceptable plan to cut the
budget deficit.
   _The decline in long-term interest rates from mid-August through
October. Lower U.S. interest rates relative to rates in other
countries make the dollar less attractive.
   _The point, driven home by the election, that the U.S. government
is divided between a Democratically-controlled Congress and a
Republican executive branch, making it more difficult to produce a
deficit-reduction plan.
   _Signs of unexpected strength and inflation in economic
statistics issued over the past two weeks.
   According to Jerry Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate
Bancorp. in Los Angeles, too much economic strength not only
increases the risk of inflation, which makes the dollar a less
attractive investment, it hurts the effort to whittle the trade
deficit.
   ``A strong economy means more imports and that the trade deficit
doesn't go down. But a weak economy means we can free up some
resources to produce exports as domestic demand falls off. That
means we get a big drop in the trade deficit and that would
strengthen the dollar,'' Jordan said.
   The appointment of New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu as White
House chief of staff also may be causing concern among currency
traders. Sununu was elected governor in 1982 on an anti-tax
platform. He's said as chief of staff he won't hesitate to offer
advice to Bush on domestic policy.
   ``This guy Sununu is going to be important. The way he has
performed ... suggests he's not going to be very favorable to
compromising on taxes. He'll reinforce Bush's campaign promises,''
Jordan said.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill To End Ocean Dumping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday signed legislation
designed to end the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean by 1992.
   The bill is aimed at closing the nation's last remaining sludge
dumping site, some 106 miles off the New Jersey coast.
   The only agencies affected by the new legislation are three
regional sewage authorities in New York, including New York City,
and six authorities in northern New Jersey.
   No other jurisdiction in the nation still dumps its sludge at sea.
   Under the measure, the agencies must end their dumping by Dec.
31, 1991, or pay stiff penalties amounting potentially to millions
of dollars.
   Meanwhile, the dumpers will begin next year to pay increased
fees, separate from potential penalties, for use of the ocean as a
dump site.
   Both the fees and fines, if needed, will be pooled to help
develop alternate disposal methods.
   Reagan's signing of the bill, without comment, climaxes a 10-year
legislative effort to halt the dumping. Congress voted a first ban
in 1978, effective in 1981, which was successfully challenged in
federal court by New York. The dumping has continued under court
authority since.
   New York lawmakers and New York Mayor Edward I. Koch opposed the
new measure, but ultimately agreed to a compromise in the face of
mounting congressional pressure.
   ``Ocean dumping is one of the most insidious forms of pollution
ever inflicted on the environment,'' said Rep. William Hughes,
D-N.J., the principal author of the bill, after it was signed into
law.
   ``We're taking big strides in our effort to clean up the ocean,''
added Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the chief Senate sponsor.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said, ``The environmental health of the
oceans and the economic health of the fishing industry demand that
we end the dumping.''

   Former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, a hero cop turned
rogue congressman, reasserted his innocence and sought mercy for his
son Friday before he was sentenced to eight years in prison for
racketeering in the Wedtech corruption scandal.
   ``I'm still of the belief, I always have been, that I am
innocent,'' the 10-term congressman told U.S. District Judge
Constance Baker Motley before she sentenced him to eight years in
prison and fined him $242,000.
   The judge said a prison term was necessary to assure the
community that ``the punishment for such crimes upon conviction will
be certain and substantial.''
   Biaggi, 71, in a voice wracked by sobs, pleaded with the judge to
spare his eldest son and co-defendant, Richard, from prison.
   ``The worst possible punishment Your Honor could administer would
be to put my son in prison,'' said Biaggi, his eyes brimming with
tears. ``I appeal to you as a father. ... Do what you want with me.
My time is done. Don't hurt Richard.''
   Richard Biaggi, 39, of Fort Lee, N.J., took off his glasses,
buried his face in his hands and wept at the defense table during
his father's plea.
   Motley later sentenced the younger Biaggi to two years in prison
and fined him $71,000.
   The elder Biaggi slumped in his chair but showed no emotion while
Motley sentenced him.
   Prosecutors said afterward that the elder Biaggi would be
eligible for parole after serving 40 months in prison.
   Despite the emotional turmoil in the courtroom, the elder Biaggi
was seen in the hall during a break, chatting amiably with relatives
and even chuckling occasionally.
   ``I think he's upset at the sentence of his son more than
anything else. I think he's upset at whether he himself can fulfill
(his own) sentence _ physically fulfill the sentence,'' said Biaggi
lawyer James LaRossa.
   Biaggi, a highly decorated city police officer from 1942 to 1965,
was convicted Aug. 5 of all but one of the 16 counts against him
including racketeering, extortion and mail fraud.
   He was accused of turning Wedtech Corp., a defunct South Bronx
defense contractor, into a racketeering enterprise that paid out
millions of dollars in bribes to public officials for help in
winning no-bid contracts.
   Richard Biaggi was acquitted of racketeering charges but was
found guilty of bribe receiving, mail fraud and tax charges.
   The elder Biaggi left the courtroom without comment after the
nearly three-hour sentencing session. He was ordered to surrender to
authorities on Jan. 9.
   He resigned from office a day after his conviction. He already
has been sentenced to 2{ years in prison for obstruction and taking
an illegal gratuity in an unrelated case.
   The most notable recent convictions of members of Congress came
from the Abscam investigation, which led to the conviction of Sen.
Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey and six members of the house,
including John M. Murphy of New York and Frank Thompson Jr. of New
Jersey.
   Biaggi, who could have been sentenced to a maximum total sentence
of 146 years in prison and $7 million in fines, was sentenced to
between two and eight years on numerous counts which Motley ordered
to run concurrently.
   The judge said Biaggi's Wedtech sentence would run concurrently
with the previous one.
   ``But for the defendant's age and the state of his health, his
prison term would be substantially longer,'' Motley said.
   Biaggi's lawyer noted before sentencing that his client suffers
from heart problems that require daily medication as well as a
pronounced limp caused by a leg injury suffered in the line of duty
as a policeman.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little told Motley that the
trial evidence showed ``Biaggi is corrupt. Biaggi took bribes ...
and sold out his office for nearly $1 million in fees and $2 million
in stocks.''
   In a final plea before sentencing, Biaggi said the five-month
trial and the month of ``devastating publicity'' before his
indictment were punishment enough.
   ``There wasn't a day I didn't suffer,'' Biaggi said. ``I died a
little bit every day. I started to die some time ago.''
   The judge received some 170 letters urging leniency and
recounting Biaggi's many contributions over the years, including 37
from Republican and Democratic congressmen.
   Three of the four other people convicted with the Biaggis last
August also were sentenced by Motley: former Bronx Borough President
Stanley Simon, 58, five years and $70,000 in fines; Wedtech founder
John Mariotta, 58, eight years, $291,000; and former Small Business
Administration official Peter Neglia, 40, three years and $30,000.
   The sentencing of Biaggi's former law partner, Bernard Ehrlich,
59, who also was convicted of racketeering, was postponed because he
was previously committed to a hospital after being found incompetent
to stand trial in a state case. A seventh defendant was acquitted on
all counts.

   The governing party on Friday nominated
the health minister to replace Philipp Jenninger, the Parliament
president who quit last week after a speech on the Nazi era caused a
furor.
   The Christian Democratic Union of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
announced its nomination of Health Minister Rita Suessmuth. Final
approval is expected next week.
   Jenninger was forced to step down after he angered Jews and
others at home and abroad with a speech Nov. 10 that described Adolf
Hitler's initial appeal to Germans in the 1930s.
   The legislative leader said Hitler was immensely popular 50 years
ago and that at the time many people felt Jews should be ``put back
in their place.''
   The speech was part of ceremonies commemorating Crystal Night,
the pogrom in Germany that signaled the start of the Holocaust.

   Police in Romania detained a senior
Hungarian diplomat accused of distributing ``hostile'' leaflets, an
official Hungarian report said Friday.
   The incident marked a further deterioration of relations between
the two communist countries, both of which belong to the Warsaw
Pact. In June, Romania closed the Hungarian consulate at Cluj-Napoca
and expelled the staff.
   Hungary's support of about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in
Romania has been at the center of the tensions. Hungary says the
minority suffers discrimination.
   A Hungarian Foreign Ministry communique said police in Romania
stopped Hungarian commercial counselor Karoly Gyorfi on Monday while
he was driving a car with diplomatic license plates, the official
Hungarian news agency MTI reported.
   The communique said Gyorfi, attached to the Hungarian Embassy in
Romania, was first accused of driving a stolen car, then of causing
an accident, and finally questioned about spreading inciting
leaflets, the news agency said.
   It said he was released after six hours. A Romanian employed at
the Hungarian Embassy who was in the car was detained along with
Gyorfi and released on Thursday, the report said.
   Foreign Minister Ioan Totu of Romania told the Hungarian
ambassador on Tuesday that the ministry had reached ``the
irrefutable conclusion that the Hungarian diplomat had spread
inciting, hostile leaflets,'' MTI reported. No details about the
nature of the leaflets were given.
   Totu asked Hungary to recall its diplomat, but Hungary made no
announcement that it would do so and denied the accusations.

<TEXT>
   A new vaccine that Third World farmers can use
to save cattle from the infectious disease, rinderpest, is ready for
field trials in Africa, the U.S. Agency for International
Development announced Friday.
   AID Administrator Alan Woods estimated it could prevent losses of
from $100 million to $250 million a year.
   ``In much of the developing world, cattle ... constitute the
family savings,'' Woods told reporters.
   Rinderpest is a highly infectious disease that usually kills
cows, buffalo and some other animals in a week or less.
   Woods said the disease was brought from Italy in the late 1930s
to Ethiopia, which Italian forces then occupied, and spread into
Africa and Asia. It has not been a problem in the United States
because vaccines already exist.
   However, use of the vaccines overseas had been restricted because
the vaccines had to remain refrigerated. That often is impossible in
remote areas of Third World countries.
   Woods said his agency invested less than a million dollars in a
cooperative venture with the University of California, Davis, to
produce a vaccine that does not need refrigeration.

<HEAD>Three Unions At Eastern Seek To Block Sale of Shuttle to Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three unions at Eastern Airlines on Friday
formally asked for a preliminary injunction to block the $365
million sale of its Northeast shuttle to real estate magnate Donald
Trump.
   The motion filed in U.S. District Court here by the International
Association of Machinists, the Air Line Pilots Association and Local
553 of the Transport Workers Union had been anticipated for a month.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in October had scheduled a
hearing on it for Dec. 2, giving Eastern until Nov. 25 to file a
response.
   The three unions contended in the motion that the sale of the
Boston-New York-Washington shuttle violates the Railway Labor Act as
part of an attempt by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., to break
the unions in the midst of collective bargaining on new contracts.
   ``The sale is yet another attempt by (Texas Air Chairman) Frank
Lorenzo to dismantle Eastern Airlines,'' said Jack Bavis, head of
the pilots' union at the carrier. ``They've done nothing but squeeze
out assets over the last two years. The shuttle is one of the
strongest links in Eastern's structure.''
   Although the shuttle has been consistently profitable, Texas Air
contends the sale is necessary to raise cash for preserving the rest
of Eastern, which has lost more than $300 million since 1986.
   The shuttle deal is scheduled for completion Dec. 15.

   Sheilah Graham, the legendary Hollywood
gossip columnist who with Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper formed
what came to be known as the ``Unholy Trio,'' has died in a hospital
here.
   Her daughter said she was 84.
   ``She's the last of the Big Three,'' her friend and former editor
Mike Kaplan said Friday. ``Of the three of them, she was the most
tenacious,'' said Kaplan, who edited her work at the Variety weekly
from 1952 to 1955.
   A spokesman at E. Earl Smith and Son Funeral Home in nearby Lake
Worth said Graham, who lived in Palm Beach, died Thursday at Good
Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach.
   Graham, born in London's East End, lived a life as controversial
as the people she wrote about.
   She had a love affair with novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in the
last three years of his life, and once lamented: ``I won't be
remembered for my writing. I'll be remembered as Scott's mistress.''
   Fitzgerald died in 1940.
   Her autobiography, ``Beloved Infidel,'' was later made into a
movie, starring Deborah Kerr and Gregory Peck.
   Driven by a childhood of poverty, first in a basement room shared
with her mother, then at an orphanage, Graham at the age of 18
married a manufacturing salesman 25 years her senior before trying
for careers as a serious actress and a music hall performer.
   She also courted the English gentry and managed to get herself
presented at Court in 1931.
   After settling on journalism, she moved to New York in 1933. Two
years later, she got her first assignment in Hollywood.
   Graham's survivors include her daughter, Wendy Fairey, son Robert
Westbrook, and three grandchildren.
   A memorial service was planned in New York in December, her
daughter said.

   Lawmakers and insurers clashed Friday over a
voter-approved measure that drastically cuts insurance rates in
California.
   Legislators began trying to put down a so-called industry revolt,
while insurance companies defended their decisions to cut back on
policies they sell.
   Democratic state Sen. Dan Boatwright accused the insurance
companies of ``literally screwing the people of the state of
California'' following passage of Proposition 103.
   Officials said the insurance companies are not renewing existing
auto policies, refusing new car insurance customers or referring
them to more expensive subsidiaries.
   Insurance company representatives said it would be unfair and
illegal to force them to operate at multimillion-dollar losses they
say they incur under the initiative's rate cuts of at least 20
percent.
   ``We cannot continue to pay claims, deliver service to our
customers and provide a return to our shareholders under the system
established by this ballot initiative,'' said Ronald Foley of The
Travelers Corp., which is pulling auto, home and some commercial
lines from the market.
   The state Supreme Court is considering the constitutionality of
Proposition 103, and lawmakers summoned industry officials to
Friday's hearing to explain their reaction to the measure.
   State Senate leader David Roberti announced legislation to pay
for the state insurance commissioner's imposition of Proposition 103
and to create an office in the Justice Department to handle consumer
complaints about insurers.
   Sen. Alan Robbins said he planned to introduce legislation Dec. 5
to levy multimillion-dollar fines against insurers who withdraw from
the market to avoid complying with the proposition.
   Robbins said the legislation would require every company to
retroactively cover all people who held policies on Election Day and
would fine insurers between 25 percent and 50 percent of the value
of every policy not renewed after Proposition 103 passed.
   Boatwright suggested legislation that would forbid companies from
writing insurance unless they are complying with the measure.
   Insurance companies filed suit against rate-cutting Proposition
103 upon its passage last week, claiming that it was
unconstitutional, primarily because it would force them to operate
at a loss.
   The state Supreme Court temporarily blocked the initiative while
it considers the challenge, for weeks, perhaps months.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp earlier this week asked the
court to lift, or at least narrow the ruling so that it blocks only
the rate rollbacks and allows the balance of the measure that
includes stiff government regulation of the industry to go into
effect.

   Three members of the former Rhodesian
security forces, two whites and a black, were sentenced to death
Friday for the death of a man in a car bomb attack on the African
National Congress.
   They were convicted in the death of Obert Mwanza, a jobless
Zambian they recruited to help in the attack. Mwanza died when the
explosives were detonated by remote control Jan. 11 outside a house
in Bulawayo occupied by the ANC, the main guerrilla group fighting
white domination in neighboring South Africa.
   The defendants are Kevin Woods, 35, and Michael Smith, 34, both
white, and Phillip Conjwayo, 54, who is black. They were members of
the security forces in Rhodesia, a white-ruled British colony that
in 1980 became Zimbabwe, with a black majority government.
   Their sentences will be appealed automatically to the Supreme
Court but probably not for a year, court officers said.
   Judge Wilson Sandura, sitting with two civilian assessors in the
High Court, said each defendant played a key role in the bombing,
which he said was conducted on behalf of South Africa, and there no
extenuating circumstances.
   Woods belonged to the Central Intelligence Organization security
police in Rhodesia, Smith was a soldier in the Rhodesian Light
Infantry and Conjwayo served in the Rhodesian police Special Branch.
They pleaded innocent to all charges.
   Sandura found them guilty of murder under a provision of
Zimbabwe's Roman-Dutch law allowing guilt through collaboration.
   Before sentencing, Woods and Smith defended the plot but
expressed regret that a civilian was killed.
   ``Our only motivation was on behalf of the people of South
Africa, who suffer mayhem and death nearly on a daily basis at the
hands of these ANC murderers,'' Woods said. ``And the countries
which harbor these murderers must look first to their own
consciences before pointing the finger at us.''
   Conjwayo said he was framed and tortured by police. He admitted
buying the car where the explosives were placed but said he did not
know how it would be used.
   Woods and Smith face a further trial on charges, along with a
third man, of bombing ANC targets in 1986.
   After sentencing, the defendants were handcuffed to prison
wardens, put in leg irons and escorted from the court building by an
armored personnel carrier full of soldiers and a truck mounted with
an anti-aircraft gun.
   A Zimbabwe air force helicopter pilot and a group of commandos
tried to rescue the three in July. The pilot escaped in a stolen
plane but the alleged rescue leader, British-born Charles Behan, was
arrested and awaits trial.

   Bill Kovach, who resigned earlier this
month as editor of The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution,
was named a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University on Friday, the
school announced.
   Kovach, 56, will join the class of 13 fellows in the prestigious
program established in 1938.
   Kovach, a former Washington bureau chief for The New York Times,
was credited with revamping and invigorating the Atlanta papers
during the nearly two years he was there. He resigned Nov. 4 after a
management disagreement, partially over control of the Cox newspaper
chain's Washington bureau.
   ``Bill Kovach will grace the Nieman program, as he has and will
continue to grace journalism,'' Nieman curator Howard Simons said in
a statement. ``We are lucky, pleased and proud to have him.''
   Kovach began his career as a reporter with the Press Chronicle in
Johnson City, Tenn., and later worked for The Nashville Tennesseean.
   The 13 other Nieman fellows were named in May and began studying
this fall.
   The Nieman Foundation was establised through a bequest of Agnes
Wahl Nieman and pays for one year of study for mid-career
journalists.

   Allegations that a Cornell University
graduate student created a ``virus'' that jammed a nationwide
network of computers are being investigated by a federal grand jury,
a prosecutor said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter confirmed the investigation
Thursday but declined to say when the panel began hearing evidence
or if anyone had been subpoenaed to testify.
   Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, is suspected of unleashing the virus on
a computer communication network earlier this month, disrupting
6,000 computers nationwide.
   Morris' friends have quoted him as saying he didn't intend any
harm.
   The virus program transmitted copies of itself from computer to
computer along the InterNet computer network, crashing an estimated
6,000 computers nationwide. It also instructed the infected
computers to make copies of the virus, filling memory space and
keeping the machines busy.
   The virus caused at least $97 million in damage, because of
interrupted work on computers that had to be shut down, and in the
work need to resuscitate the computers, the director of the Computer
Virus Industry Association said Thursday.
   ``Our calculations of the damage it caused are very conservative.
The real cost is probably well over $100 million,'' said John
McAfee, computer virus consultant and director of a Santa
Clara-based group of 11 companies that markets computer programs to
fight viral programs.
   ``The analogy there is the cost of conducting a massive search
for thousands of hidden bombs and then disabling them,'' McAfee said.
   ``Just the time that the programmers spent conferring with each
other, either in meetings or over the telephone, as they tried to
share knowledge in combatting the infection was estimated ... at
least 12,000 (hours),'' McAfee said.
   No charges have been filed.
   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation to determine if
statutes on wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawful access to
stored communications may have been broken. The FBI has subpoenaed
computer tapes and other records at Cornell's computer science
department.
   Baxter declined to say if anyone other than Morris is the target
of the grand jury investigation in Syracuse.

   Hundreds of election officials will not
participate in Saturday's balloting in Northeastern Province because
they fear attacks by both Tamil and Sinhalese militants, according
to government sources.
   Election Commissioner Chandrananda De Silva said the number of
polling booths had been reduced from 567 to 324 because of the lack
of staff. He said only 300 members of the 2,200 people scheduled to
oversee the voting were available for duty.
   He gave no reason why the others would not work but government
sources, speaking with condition of anonymity, said violence was
expected.
   The elections are for 35 members of a semiautonomous
administrative council responsible for governing the Tamil-dominated
province.
   The establishment of such councils was a key part of the
India-mediated accord signed in July 1987 to end the five-year-old
war by Tamils demanding their own homeland.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, accuse the Buddhist Sinhalese
majority of discrimination. Tamils are a majority in northeastern
Sri Lanka but comprise only 18 percent of the island country's
population of 16 million.
   Both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil
rebel organization, and Sinhalese activists have called for a
boycott of Saturday's election.
   The Liberation Tigers say an administrative council does not meet
their demands for autonomy and Sinhalese militants claim the 1987
pact grants too many concessions to the Tamils.
   Presidential elections are scheduled for Dec. 19 and the campaign
has been scarred by violence.
   Four people were killed and at least 70 were wounded Thursday
when Sinhalese extremists hurled bombs at a rally addressed by Ossie
Abeygoonasekara, the candidate of a coalition of three leftist
parties.
   Abeygoonasekara was not injured but the coalition's previous
leader, Vijaya Kumaranatunga, was assassinated in February. Police
blamed the killing on members of the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese organization.
   Top contenders in the presidential contest are Prime Minister
Ranasinghe Premadasa of the United National Party and former Prime
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Mrs.
Bandaranaike was Kumaranatunga's mother-in-law.
   The People's Liberation Front has waged a violent campaign in an
effort to force President Junius R. Jayewardene to resign before the
elections. It claims he and his United National Party will not
conduct a fair election.
   The front has threatened to kill anyone supporting the 1987
accord, and since the agreement was signed, more than 550 government
officials and supporters have been killed.
   Some Tamil organizations have accepted the agreement and have
entered candidates in Saturday's election despite threats by the
Liberation Tigers.
   Troops of an Indian peacekeeping force have been stationed in the
Noratheastern Province after the Liberation Tigers rejected the
peace plan.

   City residents placed red roses and wreaths Friday
at the entrance to King's Cross subway station where a fire one year
ago killed 31 people in the worst disaster in the 120-year history
of the system.
   Reports of smoke brought firefighters back to the station Friday.
But it proved to be a false alarm.
   About 60 people took part in a prayer service for the victims and
their families Friday evening at the nearby Blessed Sacrament Roman
Catholic Church.
   Outside King's Cross station, more than 70 friends of musician
Ivan Tarrasenko, one of the victims, staged a noisy tribute to their
mentor with an assortment of percussion instruments. They used
sticks to beat drums, metal rails, and even traffic cones.
   A dropped match started the fire at the end of evening rush hour
in one of London's busiest subway stations. An official inquiry said
haphazard staff response and complacency among managers contributed
to the disaster.
   Many of the bouquets and wreaths Friday paid tribute to Colin
Townsley, a 45-year-old firefighter who died trying to rescue
passengers.

   A young man accused of strangling his
bride after a Christmas Eve argument and leading volunteers on a
six-day search for her was found guilty Friday of second-degree
murder.
   Matthew Solomon, 22, appeared shaken when the Suffolk County jury
foreman read the verdict. He was immediately surrounded by about 20
court officers.
   His father, Jack, stood up and screamed at Diane Weaver, the
mother of victim Lisa Solomon, ``You got your pound of flesh.''
   Court officers surrounded him in efforts to calm him but minutes
later he stormed from the cramped, four-row courtroom, yelling,
``The lies you've been telling will come out.'' Solomon's mother,
Ruth, remained sitting.
   But after her son was removed, she collapsed in the courtroom,
apparently from an asthmatic attack, and was taken by ambulance to
Central Suffolk Hospital.
   Outside, as Mrs. Solomon was being put into the ambulance, the
defendant's father shouted: ``My son is the most decent thing on
God's earth and now he has been put in a cage.''
   After the verdict, Mrs. Weaver broke into tears and hugged her
brother and Lisa's uncle, Howard Klerk.
   Outside court, Klerk, who has been spokesman for Lisa's family,
said that despite the verdict, ``We didn't win anything. We don't
have Lisa back. We lost. We don't have our girl.''
   Solomon had been charged with two counts of second-degree murder,
one intentional and the other showing depraved indifference for
human life.
   The jury found him guilty of the depraved indifference count. It
carries the same maximum sentence as intentional murder, 25 years to
life in prison. County Court Judge Harvey Sherman set sentencing
Jan. 17.
   Solomon, a sheet metal worker, has been held without bail since
his arrest Jan. 11.
   Both sides in the case agreed that Solomon strangled 22-year-old
Lisa, his wife of two months, during an argument following a
champagne-and-lobster dinner in their Huntington Station apartment
last Christmas Eve.
   They both agreed that Solomon wrapped the body in plastic garbage
bags, dumped her body in a farm field and then led volunteers for
six days in a search for her.
   But the prosecution contended that while Solomon did not scheme
to have his wife murdered, he intended to kill her. The defense
claimed Solomon accidentally strangled his wife in the heat of an
argument and that Solomon's actions afterward were those of a
panic-stricken youth.
   The prosecution centered on medical testimony and Solomon's
videotaped confession to police.
   ``If Matthew Solomon had released the choke hold when his wife
stopped crying or released it when she fell into unconsciousness,
Lisa would be alive today,'' Prosecutor Timothy Mazzei told the jury.
   Mazzei said that Solomon lied about his wife's disappearance for
17 days and only admitted to strangling her when he was confronted
with evidence linking him to the crime.
   Solomon had claimed in the confession that he put his wife's neck
in an armhold to get her to calm down and stop crying during the
fight. He said they were fighting because she wanted to leave and he
didn't want her to drive because she had been drinking champagne.
   Defense attorney Jeffrey Waller tried during the trial to portray
Lisa as a ``spitfire'' who had a hot temper especially when she
drank alcohol.
   He referred to them as a immature couple, who fell in love, got
married and then had problems which ended in tragedy.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Shamir Seeks Compromise on Conversion Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he
seeks a compromise to avoid alienating U.S. Jews from Israel over
religious demands that he outlaw non-Orthodox conversions to
Judaism, a U.S. congressman said.
   Shamir's remarks to a group of congressmen and American Jewish
fund-raisers came after a group representing millions of Jews in the
United States and Canada announced at a conference in New Orleans
this week a new offensive against attempts to change the ``Who is a
Jew'' law in Israel.
   The group is the Council of Jewish Federations, which says it
represents 95 percent of the 5.5 million to 6 million Jews in North
America.
   ``All members of the Jewish community are considered members of
the Jewish people. We do not want to prefer anybody or exclude
anybody,'' Shamir was quoted as saying by Rep. Jim Courters, R-N.J.
   ``Everyone who considers himself a Jew is a Jew. We are looking
for a solution, a solution that will not give Jews in America reason
to take warning.''
   Courters said Shamir did not elaborate.
   He said Shamir spoke after Courters and fund-raisers of the
United Jewish Appeal told the Israeli leader they were ``concerned
about the redefinition of who is a Jew.''
   ``Most American Jews take exception to it,'' Cliff Sobel of the
United Jewish Appeal delegation told a reporter after the meeting.
   Harry Wall, director of the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation
League, said he considered Shamir's comments a change in Shamir's
earlier assurances to religious parties that the law would be
changed.
   ``A corner has been turned here toward mitigating this dispute,
this highly emotional issue,'' Wall said.
   Shamir, who heads the right-wing Likud bloc, earlier promised
four key swing parties of the ultra-Orthodox bloc that he would
support their bid to change Israel's Law of Return in exchange for
their support in a governing coalition.
   The Law of Return guarantees citizenship to any Jew who
immigrates. The religious parties want the law to disqualify persons
converted to Judaism by non-Orthodox rabbis.
   Most of the American Jewish community belongs to non-Orthodox
streams of Judaism, namely the Conservative and Reform movements.

   A Texas trucker accused of ramming some 30
cars during a 40-mile rampage through rush-hour traffic pleaded
guilty Friday to assault with a deadly weapon, his 18-wheel
tractor-trailer rig.
   Charley Tom Lee, 25, of Haltom City is due back in court Dec. 13,
when a psychological examination will be ordered.
   Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin accepted Lee's pleas of
guilty to five counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Prosecutors
said they would ask that Lee receive the maximum sentence of eight
years in prison.
   Lee was chased by a dozen California Highway Patrol officers, a
police helicopter and a canine unit before he was pulled over at
gunpoint on the Hollywood Freeway at rush hour on May 18.
   Drug tests on Lee turned up negative, Veals said.
   Lee's statements after his arrest indicated it was a ``joyride,''
Veals said at the arraignment. ``He said he was having fun and
didn't want to hurt anyone.''

   Heavy rain and flash flooding were possible in
Jamaica as a poorly organized tropical depression headed slowly
toward that island nation, ravaged two moths ago by Hurricane
Gilbert, forecasters said Friday.
   The late-season depression had top winds of 35 mph and was
centered about 250 miles southwest of the Jamaican capital of
Kingston, the National Hurricane Center reported. It was moving west
at about 5 mph, and little strengthening was expected over the next
24 hours.
   The Atlantic hurricane season began in June and ends Nov. 30. The
season usually peaks in September.

   Democrat John Vinich said Friday he will not
ask for a recount of votes cast in Wyoming's tight U.S. Senate race
and conceded the election to incumbent Malcolm Wallop.
   The state senator from Hudson said he spoke with Secretary of
State Kathy Karpan and decided a recount would confirm Wallop's
victory.
   Wallop won his third six-year Senate term by 1,332 votes of the
approximately 180,000 ballots cast.
   ``The only way we could verify any absentee vote or ... voting
machine problems would be to file a suit with the state against the
counties and state,'' Vinich said. ``I ran for office to serve the
people of Wyoming and not to sue the state.
   ``The issues are more important to Wyoming than putting the state
through that kind of pain.''
   Wallop's spokesman said the incumbent was pleased with the news.

he is still in the Sidon region,'' said the official of the Sunni
Moslem militia Popular Nasserite Organization, who identified
himself only by the code-name of Abu Yahya. ``We will do our best to
find him.''
   Three gunmen grabbed Winkler from a Red Cross car in Sidon. He
heads the city's office of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, which provides relief to victims of Lebanon's civil war, now
in its 14th year.
   ``Mr. Winkler should be rescued. The Red Cross shouldn't be under
any threat,'' said Abu Yahya.
   His group's militiamen, armed with assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenade launchers, searched cars and frisked their
passengers Friday at all entry points to Sidon, which lies about 25
miles south of Beirut. Their leftist militia controls the city.
   In heavy rain, joint patrols of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and local militiamen combed the crowded Ein el-Hilweh
refugee camp and nearby orange and banana groves on Sidon's southern
outskirts.
   Police and the leftist Moslem militia said they believe he was
kidnapped for a trade with Hussein Hariri, a Lebanese air hijacker
held in Switzerland.
   Hariri, a 22-year-old Shiite Moslem who belongs to the
Iranian-backed group called Hezbollah, hijacked an Air Afrique
jetliner on a flight from Rome to Paris in July 1987. He forced it
to land at Geneva airport and killed a French passenger before he
was overpowered and arrested.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested
Friday that the terrorist group led by Abu Nidal, who has been
linked to many terrorist attacks worldwide, may have kidnapped
Winkler at Hezbollah's request.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, is an umbrella
group for pro-Iranian extremist factions believed to hold most of
the 14 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans.
Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Mideast correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was captured March 16, 1985.
   The PLO joined the search for Winkler after blaming the abduction
on enemies of its newly proclaimed state of Palestine. The group
joined the leftist Moslem militia, four leftist parties, and the
mainstream Shiite Amal militia in a statement Friday denouncing the
latest kidnapping.

   The United States and France disagreed
Friday about France's decision to review NATO positions on a new
forum for conventional arms reduction talks, which Washington says
delays progress toward negotiations.
   Gilles Curien of France rejected American and other Western
claims that the French review was blocking progress. He leads his
country's delegation at the Vienna follow-up conference to the 1975
Helsinki agreements on European security and cooperation.
   Warren Zimmermann, chief U.S. delegate, said at a news briefing:
``We hope the French government is not going to put (previous NATO)
agreements into question. Because if there was a question of taking
another look at those agreements which took us such a long and
difficult time to reach, then I think we would be inevitably forced
into a long delay at the conference.''
   In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand said France remains
``very open and does not wish to be an obstacle to the immediate
negotiations. It will, rather, complain of the numerous obstacles
posed by others, so little pressed to discuss these matters.''
   Senior diplomats in East and West had expressed confidence in the
past week that talks between the 16 North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and seven Warsaw Pact countries on a new mandate for
conventional arms control talks could be concluded this year.
   The negotiations are designed to replace the Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction talks, which have dragged on without agreement in
Vienna for nearly 15 years.
   Current talks involve only seven NATO nations and four Warsaw
Pact countries, and focus on central Europe. The new talks, in
addition to involving more nations, would cover all Europe from the
Atlantic to the Ural Mountains.
   Informal talks between the 23 member countries of the two
alliances began in February 1987 as the result of security
negotiations in the review conference, at which the United States,
Canada, Soviet Union and all European countries except Albania are
represented.
   The Vienna meeting is one of several review conferences held to
review compliance with the Helsinki agreements. It began in November
1986.
   Curien said in a speech to delegates Friday that his government's
decision to review the mandate talks was made because the
negotiations are ``a major political preoccupation for Europe's
future.''
   ``We attach the greatest importance to the fact that military
affairs should not be separated from other areas of the (Helsinki
agreements), such as human rights, because the whole (process)
represents a single and unique idea for Europe's future,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, a Western official told reporters conventional
arms control is so vital to Western security that it should be
negotiated on its own merits, not in relation to other Helsinki
issues.
   He said making the talks dependent on future Helsinki review
conferences, as France wants, could jeopardize the balanced approach
the West seeks in that forum to the three main issues of security,
human rights and economic cooperation.
   Curien said the current review in Paris grew out of a need for
``clarifications'' in the conference texts, in which ``certain
paragraphs are ambiguous or at least they can give rise to various
interpretations.'' He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Peak Fertility in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women are more likely to become pregnant in
November than in any other month, says a report on fertility
published Friday.
   A study of 259 conceptions by artificial insemination at a
British hospital showed twice as many conceived in November,
December and January as in June or July, with the rate peaking in
November.
   Results echoed previous findings that natural conceptions peaked
at about the same time of year, said the report published in the
British Medical Journal.
   ``Seasonal variations in rates of natural conception in women is
well documented,'' it said. ``The peak lasts from early winter to
early spring. We found that conceptions resulting from artificial
insemination were similarly distributed.''
   The study conducted at the Jessop Hospital for Women in
Sheffield, northern England, looked at the women's conception rates
in 1974-1982.
   Doctors who did the research wrote said in their report that
seasonal variations in conception had to result from one or more of
five factors: frequency of sexual intercourse; rate of ovulation;
quality of semen; quality of the egg after ovulation, or receptivity
of the womb lining _ ``endometrial'' receptivity.
   Frequency of intercourse was irrelevent in this case, they said,
because the women's partners were infertile and artificial
insemination was used. The researchers said the ovulation rate was
``unimportant'' because only confirmed periods of ovulation were
included in the data.
   Sperm might have been the key because there was a seasonal
variation in its quality, the authors said, but added that the time
of maximum sperm count and volume was in Febuary and March _ too
early in the year to produce a November peak in fertility.
   ``By exclusion, therefore,'' the report said, ``we suggest there
is seasonal variation in the quality of the egg or endometrial
receptivity, or both, and that the time of highest quality is early
winter.''
   It did not say definitively why quality should be higher in early
winter, but suggested it could be linked to the production of extra
sex hormones, which are released in greater quantities in winter
months.
   The doctors who wrote the report said it should ``speak for
itself'' and declined comment. They are Eftis Paraskevaides,
registrar of the gynecology department at North Manchester General
Hospital; George Pennington, consultant chemical pathologist at the
Jessop Hospital, and his assistant, Sandra Naik.

   Masked men carried a bomb into a
Londonderry office Friday and ordered the occupants out before the
blast wrecked the building, police said.
   In Belfast, police defused a bomb planted under a footpath used
by school children.
   No injuries were reported in either incident. There were no
immediate claims of responsibility, although suspicion fell on the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to drive the
British from the Protestant-led province and unite it with the
heavily Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   The staff of a tax office in Londonderry were organizing
fund-raising events for a children's charity when three masked men
burst into the building, carrying a bomb they had brought in a
hijacked Post Office van, police said.
   The men ordered the staff out and then fled themselves, police
said, and minutes later the device exploded, wrecking the building.
   Belfast police said a bomb containing up to four pounds of
explosive was found under a footpath at Grosvenor Road, near a
nursery and primary school.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said young children use the path on
their way to school.

   Telephone service and computer systems along the
entire East Coast were disrupted Friday when a primary transmission
cable was severed by a construction crew in New Jersey, AT&T
announced.
   The accident in the Brown Junction railroad yard in Sayreville,
N.J., forced rerouting of thousands of calls which ordinarily use
the cable, said AT&T District Manager Jim Nelson.
   ``It's almost like a highway, in that you have to go along it to
get from say, New York to Florida,'' said Nelson. ``This is a major
blockage, affecting the whole East Coast.''
   In addition to affecting phone service, several private customers
using phone line transmissions _ including The Associated Press _
experienced service problems Friday afternoon, said Nelson.
   The disruption in service meant many callers either got a
recording telling them to dial again or a busy signal, said Nelson.
   Harry Baumgartner, a spokesman for AT&T in Basking Ridge, N.J.,
said the damage was caused by a back hoe that inadvertantly severed
a three-inch, light-guide cable.
   He said there was no way to estimate how many millions of
customers were affected.
   ``The blockage affected people in varying degrees across the
nation, with the effects concentrated on the East Coast,'' he said.
``The closer you got to the site of the broken cable the more likely
you were to have trouble completing calls.''
   Baumgartner said the problems had been cleared up by 6:30 p.m.
EST except in several New Jersey counties near the break.

<HEAD>Ban on Food Use of Animal Thyroid Glands Takes Effect Dec. 15</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal ban on the food use of livestock
thyroid glands will take effect Dec. 15, two years after it was
officially proposed, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The ban, which was proposed on Dec. 15, 1986, also will apply on
the tissue surrounding the thyroid glands, officials said. Although
federal regulations still permitted use of the glands and tissue,
federal inspectors had already been instructed to bar their use as
food.
   ``We have found a connection between consumption of meat
trimmings containing the (thyroid) gland and adjacent tissue with
thyrotoxicosis, so we are required to ban its use in food,'' said
Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service.
   Thyrotoxicosis is caused by excessive amounts of thyroid hormones
in the blood, the agency said. Disease symptoms include
sleeplessness, nervousness, increased heart rate, shortness of
breath, fatigue, excessive sweating and weight loss.
   Investigations of an outbreak of thyrotoxicocis in Minnesota in
1985 showed that some establishments, in trimming laryngeal muscle
tissue from slaughtered animals were cutting too deeply and
retaining all or part of the thyroid gland.
   Thyroid glands were not approved for food use, but trimmings from
the laryngeal muscle were used in products such as ground beef, the
inspection service said.
   After the Minnesota outbreak, federal inspectors were told to
halt the use of the glands and adjacent tissue. Further, officials
said, the largest meat processors, who accounted for about 80
percent of the use of such beef trimmings, voluntarily stopped using
the muscle tissue for trimmings.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of
Nov. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.92 million head,
down 5 percent from a year ago but 5 percent more than inventories
of two years ago, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 2.48 million head, down 5 percent from a year
ago but up 3 percent from two years ago.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in August totaled 1.6 million head,
down 5 percent from a year ago but up 1 percent from two years ago.
   As of Nov. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year
earlier in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas.
California showed an increase. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Nov. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   A National Theater revival of Tennessee Williams'
``Cat On A Hot Tin Roof'' won two out of seven awards at the 33rd
Evening Standard Drama awards Friday.
   But no best musical award was made, reflecting what has been an
exceptionally weak season for London musicals.
   Lindsay Duncan, who played Maggie the Cat, and Eric Porter, who
portrayed Big Daddy, were named best actress and actor for their
performances in the 1955 Williams play set in the deep South.
   Howard Davies directed the National's production and is due to
stage a Broadway revival of the same play, with Kathleen Turner next
year.
   The National itself won a special award in honor of its 25th
birthday last month. Diana Rigg, who gave the award to the theater's
new artistic director, Richard Eyre, led a lineup of presenters that
included Paul Scofield, Rex Harrison, Janet Suzman and Irish actor
Milo O'Shea.
   The Irish play ``Aristocrats,'' a decade-old work by Brian Friel
that made its belated London debut in June, was named best play. The
best comedy award went to Peter Shaffer's Broadway-bound ``Lettice
and Lovage,'' which opens at New York's Plymouth Theater in February.
   Timberlake Wertenbaker was cited as most promising playwright for
``Our Country's Good,'' which ended a limited run at the Royal Court
Theater Nov. 12.
   Deborah Warner was named best director for ``Titus Andronicus,''
her staging of Shakespeare's difficult play by the Royal Shakespeare
Company.

<HEAD>General Assembly Asks Developed Nations To Help Africa Economically</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly asked developed
nations Friday to increase aid to Africa and to reschedule Africa's
huge debt in an effort to save the continent's faltering economic
recovery program.
   The assembly adopted by consensus and without a vote a bleak U.N.
midterm report on African economic recovery, from 1986 to 1990, with
detailed recommendations. The 23-page report said that 2{ years into
the ambitious U.N. program, the picture is grim and little
improvement has been made.
   According to U.N. figures, Africa's total foreign debt was
estimated at $218 billion by the end of 1987, almost three times
Africa's annual export earnings.
   Per capita income in Africa fell 2 percent in 1986, 2.2 percent
in 1987 and today is lower than it was in 1980.
   The report proposed that developed countries allocate .7 percent
of their gross national product to official development assistance
to Africa.
   It also asked sub-Saharan African nations themselves to pursue
difficult reforms to make their economies more viable and
competitive.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar requested the
international community ``to make the extra effort ... in the
immediate future that will make the crucial difference in successful
implementation of the program of action.
   ``There is no escaping the close connection between external
debt, financial flows and trade, if Africa's recovery and
development is to be placed on a solid footing.''
   The program asks Africa to undertake economic reform and
development and asks the international community to support and
supplement Africa's effort. It estimated that $128.1 billion was
required for 1986-90. African countries committed themselves to
provide $82.5 billion of this amount, with the rest to come from
other nations and international lending and U.N. institutions.
   But midway in the program, the situation remains critical.
   ``The situation has not at all improved, but it has worsened in
some countries despite efforts of African countries to restructure
their economies, and despite aid from the international
communities,'' Norway's U.N. Ambassador Tom Vraalsen, chairman of
the review committee, told a news conference.
   ``Other countries must increase their support for African
countries in the years to come.''
   Vraalsen told the General Assembly that in spite of all efforts,
the situation in Africa continues to grow worse.
   He said it is characterized by unsustainable, crushing burdens of
external debt; substantial decline in export earnings because of
depressed commodity prices; decline in private investment, lending
and the like; instability of the international currency market and
abnormaly high interest rates.
   Vraalsen also said that some African governments committed to
cutting their budgets cut spending on education and health and cut
lower-paying jobs in the bureaucracy instead of higher paying, less
essential jobs.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters told the assembly the United
States aids Africa but emphasizes the importance of economic reform
by African nations themselves.
   ``While growth payoffs have not been as rapid or predictable as
everyone would have liked, there has been a clear improvement in
growth rates among the reforming African countries as a group,''
Walters said.
   ``The reform path is going to be long and arduous. Africa is not
at the end of the reform process, but at the beginning ... If Africa
fails to sustain reform, or implements it half-heartedly, the
continent risks repeaitng the decline and depression of the recent
past.''
   Report recommendations range from greater support for women _ the
primary producers in Africa _ to rescheduling the external debt of
African nations.
   ``Non-concessional officially guaranteed debt and debt-service
payments of low-income African countries should be rescheduled on
more generous terms,'' the report said, in one of many
recommendations on debt, loans and credits.

<HEAD>By DOUG FISHER</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal court jury Friday ordered the
Rhode Island State Police's two top officers to pay $125,000 to a
woman trooper who was the victim of their harassment, sex
discrimination and retaliation.
   Trooper Mary Nunes, 25, said she was ``just really happy that it
ended this way. Ecstatic, actually.'' The defendants and their
attorneys refused to comment.
   The seven-person jury, which in late October found the state and
three other defendants liable, reached its verdict on damages after
about 1{ days of deliberations.
   The state; Col. Walter Stone, the police superintendent; Maj.
Lionel Benjamin, Stone's deputy; and Lt. Walter Reynolds, commandant
of the police training academy, were found liable for various counts
of sex discrimination, harassment, retaliaton or invasion of privacy.
   ``I didn't really come into this for money, and I think my
victory came last week, actually two weeks ago, when they found the
department guilty of harassing women and harassing me. That was all
I really wanted,'' Nunes said. ``This money was just lawyer's fees.
That's things that have to be done.''
   Nunes claimed during the trial that her problems began during the
1985-86 training academy with a physical training program allegedly
aimed at washing women out of the force.
   She said the problems worsened after graduation when Stone and
Benjamin ordered investigations into her private life, including
whom she dated, a party for off-duty officers at her parents' home
and an accident in her private car.
   The seven-member jury awarded only $4 from the defendants to
compensate her for actual injuries. That included $1 to be paid by
Reynolds.
   The $75,000 award against Stone and the $50,000 award against
Benjamin was in punitive damages designed to deter any future
conduct. The state apparently will compensate them only for nominal
damages, but not for a punitive award.
   The verdict was ``a remarkable day for Rhode Island,'' said one
of Nunes' attorneys, Joseph Levin, who had set out to show that the
police policies were so outdated they made discrimination almost
inevitable.
   Judge Ernest C. Torres has set a Monday hearing on motions to
dismiss the case and from Nunes' attorneys for non-monetary damages,
including a possible injunction against future discrimination and
supervision of the department.
   ``I have no idea what the jury did when they decided this case. I
still don't. The case is still going on,'' said
   Reynolds' lawyer Joseph V. Cavanagh Jr. claimed that the case was
an attempt by the Fraternal Order of Police, which sued along with
Nunes and still has a case pending, to oust Stone, who has been
superintendent for 27 years.
   Reynolds, who left the court stonefaced, refused to comment,
Benjamin said he was disappointed but he and other attorneys
declined further comment.
   Stone, 77, was not in court and was in a meeting and not
available to comment, said an officer who answered the telephone at
state police headquarters. Stone did not return a telephone message.
   Cavanagh said earlier that he would attempt to pursue an appeal.
   The jury found Stone liable for $55,000 for sexual discrimination
and harassment, $10,000 for retaliation against Nunes when she
complained, and $10,000 for invading her privacy.
   Benjamin was found liable for $10,000 for discrimination and
harassment and $20,000 each for retaliation and invasion of privacy.
   Stone, who makes $103,600 a year in salary and a Providence
police pension, testified he has about $300,000 in assets. Benjamin,
54, makes $84,000 a year, testified he has about $175,000 in assets.
   Nunes, who thanked the union and her parents for their support,
called it ``a matter of principal'' and said she was prepared to
take the case as far as necessary in the appeals courts. ``It will
be a battle to the end,'' she said.
   The trooper said she would try to stay on the force, but ``if the
harassment continues from my administrators, it depends on how long
I can take it.''

   Up to 11 inches of snow fell in parts of the Southwest on Friday,
and rain and thunderstorms increased over Arkansas and the
Mississippi Valley as southerly winds continued bringing moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico.
   Crested Butte, Colo., reported 11 inches of new snow overnight,
and 5 inches fell at the south rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.
   Snow advisories were posted Friday afternoon for the southern
mountains of Colorado, the northeast quarter of Arizona and the
northern and western mountains of New Mexico.
   Over an inch of rain fell in 30 minutes over parts of Little
Rock, Ark., while other thunderstorms produced pea-size hail at
Sulphur Springs, Texas.
   Rain fell from eastern Texas across most of Arkansas, southern
Missouri, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and
northern Mississippi.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 2.5 inches at Little Rock, almost 2 at Hot Springs, Ark.,
and more than half an inch at Jonesboro, Ark.
   Heavy snow was expected over much of the central Plains as an
upper level disturbance over Arizona moves northeast. A winter storm
watch was posted through Saturday for the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles and portions of Kansas, where up to 8 inches of snow was
forecast.
   Snow also was forecast Saturday for eastern Nebraska, western
Iowa, much of Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. Occasional light
snow fell across portions of the Dakotas and western Minnesota.
   Winds up to 35 mph were reported over the mountains and deserts
of southern California. Partly cloudy skies prevailed across the
East Coast states.
   Temperatures ranged from the upper 40s to the 50s over southern
New England and the middle Atlantic Coast states. Readings were
mostly in the 60s across the Carolinas. In Florida, temperatures
were in the mid-to-upper 80s.
   Temperatures in the West were mostly in the 30s and 40s, and in
the 50s and 60s in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Glasgow Mont., to 91 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   The low in the nation Friday morning was minus 3 at Williston,
N.D.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
from the southern plains across the Mississippi Valley to the lower

<TEXT>
   More than 90,000 ethnic Albanians
rallied throughout Kosovo province Friday to protest the force
resignations of two provincial leaders, and officials warned the
demonstrators to go home.
   The rally in Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, was estimated
by the state news agency Tanjug at 70,000, making it the largest
demonstration ever in Kosovo.
   At least 22,000 other people gathered for rallies in other Kosovo
towns to protest also the continuing pressure from the Serbian
republic for more control over its restive southern province,
Belgrade radio and television reported.
   The protests set off a flurry of meetings and warnings by
provincial and federal officials in this communist country.
   Kosovo's acting Communist Party President Remzi Koljgeci, an
ethnic Albanian, went on Pristina radio late Friday, telling
demonstrators to disperse or ``we will be forced to undertake all
measures available under the constitution.'' He did not elaborate.
   After his appeal, crowds began to break up in Pristina.
   Stefan Korosec, secretary of the powerful national Central
Committee, made a similar appeal on national radio and television.
But he did not make any threats.
   Korosec and Interior Minister Dobroslav Culafic, head of
Yugoslavia's police forces, traveled to the province Friday to try
to quell the unrest, news reports said.
   State television appealed to ethnic Albanians, who were
descending on Pristina for official celebrations Saturday of the
city's 1944 liberation from the Nazis, to stay away. It said the
situation was ``deteriorating.''
   Witnesses said at least 20 trucks filled with riot police were
seen moving toward Pristina, indicating a crackdown might be
imminent.
   The national Communist Party's ruling Politburo met in emergency
session Friday evening to discuss the protests.
   Kosovo's leaders discussed the possibility of ``emergency
measures ... in case the so far peaceful protests turn into riots,''
an informed source close to the leadership told The Associated
Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Protesters held thousands of portraits of the late Yugoslavian
leader Josip Broz Tito, who signed the 1974 constitution granting
Kosovo wide autonomy.
   ``We don't want changes of Tito's constitution!'' the protesters
chanted in Albanian. ``We will give our lives, but we will not give
up Kosovo!''
   The protests followed the forced resignations Thursday of two
popular Kosovo ethnic Albanian leaders, Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari.
   The most recent eruption of thnic violence in Kosovo was in 1981,
when at least nine people died as about 40,000 ethnic Albanians
clashed with police after demanding that Kosovo become a
full-fledged Yugoslav republic.
   Vlasi and Jasari have been the main targets of resignation
demands by Serbia's Communist Party chief Slobodan Milosevic in his
drive to bring Kosovo under tighter Serbian control. Kosovo's
minority Serbs and Montenegrins, mainly Christian, claim
discrimination by the predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority.
   Vlasi addressed the Pristina crowd at a municipal sports stadium,
saying: ``I think this gathering is the reaction to the pressures
and against ongoing, vulgar, nationalist hatred'' at some Serbian
rallies.
   Milosevic planned to address a mass rally in Belgrade on
Saturday. It is expected to draw up to 1 million Serbs, a source at
Belgrade television said.
   Vlasi, who on Thursday was forced to leave Kosovo's 13-member
ruling Politburo, promised the demonstrators their demands would be
discussed at another emergency leadership meeting Saturday.
   Dispersing peacefully ``is the best way to help the Kosovo
leadership,'' Vlasi told the crowd. ``Excesses will only play into
the hands of our opponents.''
   Mass rallies by hundreds of thousands of Serbs in recent months
have backed Milosevic's drive against Vlasi, Jasari and other ethnic
Albanian leaders blamed by Serbs for the alleged harassment of the
Slav minority in Kosovo.
   The ethnic Albanian crowd at the Pristina stadium waved Yugoslav
and Communist Party flags and was strongly pro-Yugoslav, reflecting
the tacit support ethnic Albanians have won from non-Serbian
Communist leaders opposed to Milosevic.

   The second crash of a B-1B bomber in nine
days probably will not force another grounding of the nation's fleet
of advanced jet bombers, an Air Force general said Friday.
   The four crewmen parachuted to safety Thursday night, but the
$280 million plane was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at
Ellsworth Air Force Base during a routine training flight.
   The crash came two days after officials reported that the Air
Force had inspected and cleared more than two-thirds of the 98 B-1B
bombers, which were grounded briefly following a crash Nov. 8 that
destroyed a plane in Texas.
   The plane involved in Thursday's crash underwent a three-hour
inspection Monday and was cleared for flight, Air Force officials
said.
   ``I see no reason to believe we will ground the fleet. I've
talked to my bosses, and there is no intention at this time to
ground them,'' said Brig. Gen. Robert Marquette Jr., commander of
the 12th Air Division at Ellsworth.
   The Ellsworth crash and a B-1B crash last week in Texas do not
appear to be linked to the same cause, Marquette said after a tour
of the crash site. ``We have evidence there was an engine fire'' in
the Texas crash, he said.
   It will take a team of military and civilian experts at least 30
days to evaluate crash evidence, he said.
   The ejection system can propel crew members 100 to 150 feet into
the air, allowing them to parachute safely to the ground, he said.
Marquette said he did not know how fast or high the plane was flying
when the crew bailed out.
   Marquette refused to speculate on the cause of Thursday's crash
but said there was no evidece of an engine fire. At least one
witness reported seeing an engine on fire before the crash.
   An Air Force statement released at the Pentagon in Washington
said there was no fire on board, and Pentagon sources said Thursday
the plane apparently clipped utility lines as it came in for its
final landing.
   The long-range strategic bomber was trying to land when it
crashed at 10:40 p.m., toppling a utility pole that cut off power to
two schools and a housing area.
   ``I could hear the plane coming in for a landing,'' said John
Hanzel, who lives next to the base. ``I heard a muffled boom. It
just lit the field up, probably for about 10 minutes.''
   ``The engine was on fire before it (the plane) hit the ground,''
witness Dale Landreth told Rapid City radio station KOTA.
   Another eyewitness, Ron Fisher, said, ``We saw a big ball of fire
that lit up the sky.''
   Todd Heinle, a police officer in the nearby town of Box Elder,
said he was less than a mile away in a convenience store parking lot
and noticed the plane because of a noise.
   ``It almost sounded like the plane was trying to increase in
power. It was making a weird noise,'' Heinle said.
   He and a fellow officer saw the wings tilt one way and then the
other way, then the lights in the plane went out. ``It was just a
split second after the lights went out, there was an explosion and
the flames started to come up.''
   Heinle drove to an area close to the wreckage near the runway and
saw the plane on the ground. ``The plane was laying on the ground in
flames,'' he said. ``It was pretty much destroyed.''
   One of the four crewmen was injured, said Sgt. Tony Evans of the
Ellsworth public information office. The crew members were
identified as: Capt. Mick R. Guthals, pilot, Los Alamos, N.M.; Capt.
Grover M. Gossett, offensive systems officer, Aiken, S.C.; Major
Dean C. Spraggins, defensive systems officer, Voorheesville, N.Y.,
and Major Thomas C. Skillman, aircraft commander, Bellmeade, N.J.
Spraggins, the injured crewman, was listed in good condition at
Lackland Air Force Base in Texas for treatment of a back injury.
   The crash was the fourth in the four years since the United
States began flying B-1 aircraft, the nation's first new long-range
bomber in more than 25 years.
   Last week, a B-1B crashed in a field near Dyess Air Force Base in
west Texas. The crew of four ejected and survived.
   The long-range bomber built by Rockwell International is designed
to fly at high speed and low altitude and deliver nuclear weapons.
   Marquette said he couldn't comment on whether the plane carried
nuclear weapons.But the Air Force statement Thursday said: ``The
bomber carried no weapons. There was no fire on board prior to the
crash.''

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met Friday
night with Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, an activist
source said, but the results were not reported immediately.
   Government and Roman Catholic Church officials were unusually
secretive throughout the day about the meeting, which appeared to be
the latest effort to salvage stalled round-table talks between the
government and Solidarity.
   Kiszczak asked Walesa three weeks ago for a face-to-face meeting
to remove obstacles to the long-promised talks on the future of
Solidarity and on the broader issues of economic and political
reform. A week ago, he sent another message to Walesa but neither
side has made public the contents.
   The activist source, a member of the outlawed Solidarity,
confirmed a meeting had taken place and said the independent trade
union would have a statement Saturday morning. The source spoke
shortly before midnight and on condition his name not be used.
   The discussions were offered by the government during Poland's
worst wave of labor unrest in seven years.
   After accepting the offer, Walesa agreed to bring an end to the
last of the strikes.
   Walesa drove to Warsaw from his home in Gdansk on Thursday night
and conferred Friday with advisers and church officials before
meeting Kiszczak.
   Walesa's close adviser, historian Bronislaw Geremek, said Friday
that the only ``decisive'' issue blocking round-table talks was
whether the government would show a ``will to legalize Solidarity.''
   He said that if the government makes a positive sign, ``then it
seems the chance for the round-table will return.''
   Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, has met three times
with Kiszczak about setting up the talks, the last time on Sept. 16.
   The official press quoted Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
as saying the fate of the proposed talks could be made clear in
coming days.
   The official Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu said Friday
the authorities were not to blame for failure of the discussions to
start as originally planned on Oct. 17.
   It accused the opposition of insisting that the government
concede beforehand on the major issue of relegalizing Solidarity,
banned after Jaruzelski imposed martial law in December 1981.
   The talks were promised Aug. 31 in a meeting between Walesa and
Kiszczak. But preparations broke down when the government objected
to the proposed participation of longtime Solidarity advisers Adam
Michnik and Jacek Kuron, who officials branded as too extreme in
their views.
   Walesa said he would tolerate no government interference in his
delegation.
   Other issues that were blocking the round-table appear to have
been resolved.

   A runaway train reaching speeds exceeding
80 mph raced through five towns and across more than 200 miles of
West Texas plains Friday without headlights or other warning
signals, authorities said.
   The train was derailed on a side track east of Van Horn, about
125 miles east of El Paso, and smashed into 27 parked boxcars but no
injuries were reported.
   ``It couldn't have happened at a better time,'' Union Pacific
spokesman Alex Tice said from the company's headquarters in Omaha,
Neb. ``The line was clear, and there wasn't much traffic out at that
time of the night.''
   Tice said the train's journey began about 1:30 a.m. Friday in Big
Spring when someone started the engines on three Union Pacific
locomotives, pushing one to full throttle. Union Pacific believes
vandals are responsible.
   The unmanned train _ with no cars attached _ ran through two
switches in Big Spring onto the main line, Tice said. It traveled
214 miles before it was derailed, he said.
   In Midland, the train almost collided with a police car that was
approaching the crossing, said Midland County Sheriff's Deputy
Richard Gillette.
   ``I just knew there had to be something wrong,'' said Gillette, a
former railroad employee. ``It was moving so fast that it was
passing through the crossings before the signals could be activated.
   ``One of our units clocked it going 67 (mph),'' Gillette said.
``I tried to keep up with it for a couple of minutes. It just ran
off and left me.''
   Gillette contacted his dispatcher, who phoned Union Pacific
officials in Omaha.
   Tice said the railroad began contacting officials in counties
along the route.
   ``When I first heard about it, I thought somebody was pulling a
joke,'' said Gary Ingram of the Reeves County Sheriff's Department.
``I told them I might saddle my horse and try to run it down, but I
didn't think it could run that fast.
   ``They didn't find a whole lot of humor in that,'' he said.
   Ingram said he watched the train pass about 1{ miles south of his
ranch in Toyah.
   From Pecos, the engines sped to Toyah at more than 80 mph, Tice
said.
   The train finally was derailed when it was switched to a side
track at Wild Horse Siding, about seven miles east of Van Horn, Tice
said.
   After smashing into the boxcars, the lead engine came to a rest
on its left side about 250 feet in front of the other two engines,
its left side scratched and dented and the engine compartment doors
open, spilling diesel fuel.
   The second and third engines stood upright in a puddle of mud
created by spilled fuel.
   A Union Pacific supervisor at the scene said the engines would be
lifted aboard a ``hospital train'' and taken to Fort Worth for
repairs.
   About 500 to 600 feet of track were damaged in the derailment,
Tice said.

   Seven soldiers were charged Friday in
the escape of a rebel who commanded the communist army that has
fought to overthrow the government for 19 years.
   A prominent stage director said he received a summons from the
military to explain whether he was involved in the Nov. 12 escape of
Romulo Kintanar, 41, and Kintanar's wife, Gloria, 38.
   Military prosecutors charged former stockade commander Maj.
Robelito Comilang, two other officers and four enlisted guards with
negligence for letting the Kintanars leave their cells to attend
Comilang's birthday party at his quarters next to the stockade at
Camp Crame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary.
   When guards returned to take the couple back to their cells, they
had disappeared, the military says.
   An officer at the constabulary's Judge Advocate General's Office
said the seven could face dismissal from service or imprisonment if
convicted.
   The military said Kintanar was commander of the 25,000-member New
People's Army when he and his wife were arrested in Manila last
March. The military hailed the arrest as a major blow to the 19-year
insurgency.
   The Kintanars were awaiting trial on rebellion charges.
   Kintanar also was believed to have organized urban guerrilla
squads responsible for killing hundreds of police and soldiers in
Philippine cities since 1985.
   In a letter published Friday by The Manila Standard and the
Philippine Daily Inquirer, Kintanar said he and his wife have
``succeeded in rejoining our comrades and our people in the
countryside to actively contribute our humble share in our people's
continuing struggle for national freedom and social liberation.''
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
prominent stage director visited the stockade on Nov. 12 and allowed
the couple to flee in his car.
   Behn Cervantes told reporters that he was the director alluded to
by the military. He said he visited Mrs. Kintanar and other
prisoners at the stockade but left before the escape.
   ``They are using me as a scapegoat,'' Cervantes said. ``Why blame
me if their security measures are lax?''
   About 500 activists who joined a rally Friday at a central Manila
square marched on the presidential palace later. At the foot of the
bridge leading to the palace, they lit candles to symbolize the
disappearance of about 100 activists this year.
   Rally leaders denounced Corazon Aquino's government for allegedly
tolerating the same abuses practiced by ousted ruler Ferdinand
Marcos. Mrs. Aquino has ordered security officials to investigate
the disappearances.
   The left-wing New Patriotic Alliance, which says 15 of its
members have disappeared this year, released a statement urging Mrs.
Aquino and the congress to find the soldiers it believes caused the
disappearances.
   Police blocked the protesters on the bridge near the palace but
allowed them to hold a brief demonstration.

   Up to 30 inches of snow in
Yellowstone National Park has snuffed out the last of the fires that
raged through the nation's oldest park this summer, the park
announced Friday.
   The fires affected about 995,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre
park. But only about 20,000 acres suffered ``high-intensity heat''
fires that scorch the earth so badly it does not renew itself.
   Crews have spent weeks replanting seedlings in burned-out areas,
taking measures to prevent erosion of hiking trails and doing other
rehabilitation work.
   Current snow depths range from 8 inches to 30 inches, said park
spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.

   Concrete barriers that would have
prevented a car carrying four young people from plunging into a
river had been inexplicably moved, officials said Friday.
   Police also said 24 mostly empty beer cans were found inside the
car. None of the occupants, all of whom died, was of legal drinking
age, which is 21.
   The car was discovered at the bottom of Mill River on Thursday,
five days after the four friends from East Lyme disappeared during a
night out in New Haven.
   The accident occurred on a dark stretch of road that was shut
down last year because a 105-year-old swing-bridge was beyond
repair. The bridge was left open, parallel to the river, so boats
could pass by on either side.
   Mayor Biagio DiLieto said an investigation confirmed the 2-ton
barriers had been moved, leaving a gap wide enough for a car to pass
through.
   Autopsies determined the four had drowned, the state medical
examiner's office said. Results of blood-alcohol tests are expected
next week, but police said they did not know if they would be made
public.
   Police said they had not yet determined who was driving the car,
which belonged to Christy Stevens.
   Separate funeral services, beginning Saturday, were planned for
Miss Stevens, Laura Lagrotteria and Jill Sawyer, all 19, and Michael
Gallo, 20.
   Sawyer attended the University of Rhode Island, Gallo was a
student at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, and
Stevens was a student at Mohegan Community College in Norwich.
Lagrotteria worked at a pizza parlor in East Lyme.
   The blocks were out of place when the car went into the river,
but officials said the city did not learn until Wednesday, when a
police officer visited the site, that there was a gap large enough
for a car to fit through.
   The hole was closed that day.
   Police found the blocks out of position after an Oct. 22 car
accident at the site, but city officials said reports indicated the
gap was not large enough at that time for a car to fit through. The
accident was the third at the barriers since the bridge was closed
in August 1987.
   City officials said they are investigating why public works crews
put up wooden barriers after the accident but did not return the
blocks to their original position.

   President Reagan's empowering a federal
agency to prepare and impose evacuation plans for nuclear plants
like Seabrook flouts the intent of Congress and faces certain legal
challenge, a Seabrook foe said Friday.
   Reagan on Friday signed the order giving the Federal Emergency
Management Agency broad new powers to submit evacuation plans for
nuclear plants which have been unable to obtain licenses because of
state or local opposition.
   ``I'm sure the intervenors in the (Seabrook) case will do
something about it, because Congress did not change the laws, and
clearly they did not intend that the federal government should usurp
state and local planning,'' said Jane Doughty of the Seacoast
Anti-Pollution League.
   The 2-year-old, $5.7 billion Seabrook reactor has no operating
license because Massachusetts towns within its 10-mile evacuation
zone and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have refused to
cooperate in emergency planning.
   Reagan's order lets FEMA develop an evacuation plan and submit it
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on behalf of the local
community. Until recently, states were required to submit an
evacuation plan in the NRC licensing process. Due to opposition to
Seabrook by Massachusetts and to the Shoreham plant on Long Island
by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the NRC has accepted but not approved
plans for both plants written by their utility owners.
   Both plans face legal challenges.
   Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H., said the final version seems slightly
weaker than the wording in the original draft, ``much more
conciliatory.''
   He said he supports the thrust of the order, because he feels the
federal government must step in when state or local governments try
to block a plant's licensing.
   Gov.-elect Judd Gregg, former 2nd District congressman, and Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., condemned the order when it was reported
earlier this year but they did not return calls from the Associated
Press seeking comment.
   Paul McEachern, a Seabrook foe who lost his bid as the 1988
Democratic gubernatorial nominee, said the order was a foregone
conclusion that the Reagan administration put the order on a back
burner until after the election.
   ``The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming that was the case,
that they would get it signed at the first appropriate time after
the election,'' McEachern said.
   ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has demonstrated it will
change any rule that gets in the way of licensing (Seabrook), and
with the election results, there is absolutely nothing that will
prevent this administratively from going on line. There may be legal
challenges, but that's all that remains,'' McEachern said.
   Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams said the order really does
nothing to hasten Seabrook's licensing. He said the plant's owners
already received NRC permission to develop their owns plans for
uncooperative Massachusetts communities, and New Hampshire has
cooperated all along.
   Those plans were tested earlier this year and received high marks
from FEMA, he said.
   ``I don't see this speeding licensing,'' Williams said. ``It is
welcome news really on the national level, because any plant that
faces that situation of non-participation like we faced now has
clear federal policy on how federal resources would be used in
planning.''

Norodom Sihanouk said the last round of talks toward a settlement in
his country had failed, a French news agency reported Friday.
   Sihanouk blamed Hun Sen, head of the Vietnam-installed government
in Phnom Penh, for creating an impasse in the talks, Agence-France
Presse reported.
   Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia from 1941-1970, is head of a
resistance coalition fighting the government in Cambodia.
   AFP said he made his remarks late Thursday to a group of students
in this southern French town.
   Sihanouk met Hun Sen and Son Sann, representing the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, at a hotel outside Paris Nov. 6.
The talks were part of efforts by the resistance movements and the
Cambodian government to reach an agreement on the future of Cambodia.
   Sihanouk accused Hun Sen of putting Vietnamese and Soviet
interests ahead of Cambodian concerns, AFP reported. The Soviet
Union backs Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 and maintains
120,000 troops there.
   China backs the Khmer Rouge, held responsible for a reign of
terror in which a quarter of Cambodia's 8 million people died before
Vietnam invaded and ousted the government. Hun Sen's government,
picked by Vietnam, has not been recognized by non-communist nations.
   The Khmer Rouge is not taking part in the talks. Sihanouk has
said no settlement is possible without the Khmer Rouge, who were
invited to the last meeting, but who were eventually excluded
because the proposed envoy was rejected as too low ranking for a
summit.
   ``The discussions yielded no concrete results simply because Hun
Sen was defending the interests of Vietnam,'' Sihanouk was quoted as
saying, adding, according to AFP, that resistance groups and the
government were ``speaking two different languages''.
   Sihanouk said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and authorities
in Beijing now were key to settling the dispute, the agency
reported. China wants concessions in exchange for withdrawing its
support of the 40,000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the largest resistance
force. Moscow wants assurance that upon Vietnam's withdrawing its
troops in 1990 as expected the Khmer Rouge will not take power.
   ``I am counting on the two superpowers to convince Vietnam to
reach a peaceful political solution to the problem of Cambodia,''
Sihanouk was quoted as saying.
   Vietnam is not participating directly in the peace talks. AFP
said Sihanouk called on Vietnam to ``participate in an international
conference in Paris.''
   The meeting made no substantial progress toward settlement but
established a working commission based in Paris. The commission's
brief is to ``study all the possibilities for a political solution
to the Cambodian problem''.

<HEAD>Carlucci: Brazil Pledges `Responsible' Arms Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci
said Friday that Brazilian officials pledged to follow a responsible
policy of arms sales, especially to Libya.
   He arrived in Brazil Thursday for a four-day private visit. He
met Friday with President Jose Sarney and top military and civilian
Cabinet ministers.
   Carlucci told a news conference at the U.S. Embassy that he
discussed Brazilian arms sales to the Mideast and Libya.
   ``Brazil has assured us it will follow a responsible policy, and
we accept that,'' Carlucci said.
   He said America was willing to step up the supply of technology
to Brazilian arms manufacturers, but declined to elaborate.
   Brazil is a major arms supplier to the Third World. Middle East
and African nations are important clients.
   Carlucci described Brazil-U.S. military relations as
``excellent.'' However, Brazilian Navy Minister Adm. Henrique Saboia
called relations ``cool'' and said Carlucci's visit was aimed at
``warming them up a little.''
   Carlucci said the U.S. government was not concerned that Sarney
recently visited the Soviet Union, and that Brazil and the Soviets
agreed to exchange military attaches.
   ``The United States doesn't discourage relations of any country
with Moscow. On the contrary, the more the Soviets open to the West,
the more evident it is that their regime is a failure,'' he said.

   A broken jet fuel pipeline at the San
Francisco International Airport disrupted dozens of incoming and
departing flights and temporarily stranded scores of passengers
Friday afternoon.
   Incoming flights were diverted to airports throughout the West
Coast, and numerous departing flights were delayed several hours,
said airport spokesman Ron Wilson. Exact figures were not available.
   Contractors broke a 12-inch underground fuel line near the TWA
terminal about 4:30 p.m., effectively shutting off supplies to all
three terminals, Wilson said.
   ``Pilots are being advised that there is no fuel available,''
said Jennifer Donohue of the airport's public affairs department.
   Fuel service was restored about two hours later to most of the
airport, said Donohue, although delays were expected to continue
into the evening. At least four airlines faced flight delays late
into the evening because of cleanup operations and continued
difficulty in fuel delivery.
   About 50,000 gallons of fuel spilled and were contained a short
time later when the pipeline was shut off to stop it from spreading
into San Francisco Bay, said Donohue.
   Airport officials estimated there are 60 to 70 flights each hour
in and out of the airport on Fridays.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife, Imelda, reported Friday to the FBI to turn over financial
records and submit fingerprints, palm prints, voice and handwriting
samples under a federal court order.
   FBI agents cleared the building before the Marcoses arrived at
5:20 p.m. (10:20 p.m. EST).
   Mrs. Marcos clutched a hankerchief and wiped away tears as she
walked beside her husband, who was seated in a wheelchair and
wearing a neckbrace. She was followed by a nurse and several aides.
   The Marcoses were accompanied by two attorneys and several FBI
agents who helped them make their way through a throng of
journalists. The couple smiled, but refused to answer questions.
   Several supporters greeted the Marcoses outside the Prince Kuhio
Federal Building, including some holding signs that said, ``Justice
for the Marcoses.''
   New York attorney Richard Hibey had said Marcos would obey the
order despite ill health. Hibey and attorney John Bartko of San
Francisco accompanied the Marcoses, who have been indicted on
federal racketeering charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Peyton is to receive the financial
records.
   Ralph Girardi, assistant special FBI agent-in-charge, said none
of the samples or records will be made public, he said. ``It's all
grand jury stuff.''
   Marcos, 71 and his wife, Imelda, 59, were indicted last month in
New York City on charges they plundered $103 million from the
Philippine treasury and defrauded U.S. banks of $165 million.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and was released on
$5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress Doris Duke, a close
friend who owns a home here.
   Marcos, however, has not been arraigned. His attorneys claim he
is too frail to make the 10-hour trip to New York.
   Doctors have said calcium deposits are building up at Marcos'
knee joints, making it hard for him to walk. In the past, his aides
have said Marcos suffered from chest pains, severe headaches and an
eye ailment.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Marcoses to hand
over the records and samples or face being held in contempt of court
and jailed.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after a civilian-military
revolt ended his 20-year rule and catapulted President Corazon
Aquino to power.

<HEAD>51 Melanesians Freed In Paris and Noumea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty-one native Melanesians were released from
prisons in Paris and New Caledonia over a period ending Friday as
part of a plan approved by voters Nov. 6 outlining the future of the
French Pacific island territory.
   The statute calls for New Caledonia, 11,000 miles from Paris, to
hold a local referendum on independence in 1998.
   The Socialist government of President Francois Mitterrand hopes
the plan will bring peace to the islands, where nearly 40 people
have died in intercommunal violence since 1984.
   The law provided amnesty for any person charged with actions of a
political nature, except murder, before Aug. 20.
   In Paris, 26 militant separatists were released from jails
Thursday night. They had been held in connection with an attack on a
police outpost at Fayoue, New Caledonia, on April 22 in which four
gendarmes were killed and 21 taken hostage.
   They immediately left for New Caledonia aboard a special plane
provided by the government after being escorted to Orly Airport by
French police.
   French troops freed the hostages in an assault May 5 in which 19
people, mostly Melanesian separatists, died.
   In Noumea, New Caledonia's capital, 25 other Melanesians who were
held following violence last April and May were released late
Thursday night and early Friday morning.
   Authorities in New Caledonia are reviewing the files on a dozen
other Melanesians still held to see if they also will be freed under
the new law.
   The archipelego of New Caledonia has been torn by periodic
violence between native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, and white
European settlers.
   Kanaks, most of whom favor independence from France, make up 43
percent of New Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants. The settlers, most
of whom want to remain French, comprise 37 percent. The rest of the
population is predominantly Polynesians and Asians, who mostly favor
France.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's ambassador to Britain, Mohammed Sadiq
al-Mashat, denied Friday that three expelled members of his staff
spied on Iraqi dissidents and compiled an assassination list.
   ``This is absolutely false,'' Mashat said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``Our staff are law-abiding
citizens.''
   British newspapers and the BBC reported earlier Friday that the
expelled Iraqis monitored Iraqi dissidents. The Independent
newspaper said the dissidents included members of a clandestine
Iraqi Shiite Moslem terrorist organization, al-Dawa.
   The Foreign Office announced Thursday night that two diplomats
and the ambassador's driver were told on Oct. 18 that they had two
weeks to leave Britain. It said Iraq expelled three British
diplomats in retaliation.
   The Foreign Office accused the three and a fourth Iraqi diplomat
who was not allowed back into Britain of ``activities incompatible
with their status'' _the diplomatic phrase for spying.
   Mashat denied that his driver was expelled. He said the
non-diplomat ordered out was a receptionist who dealt with Arabs at
the embassy _ ``Just a simple employee who doesn't know English, who
doesn't know how to drive.''
   An unidentfied Iraqi dissident, also interviewed by the BBC,
charged Friday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was taking
advantage of the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war ``to liquidate
opponents.''
   He said exiles' families in Iraq received threatening phone calls
and were intimidated or pressured in other ways.

<TEXT>
   The Anglican and Roman Catholic archbishops in
England have urged the government to order new legal hearings of the
life terms imposed on four Irish people after IRA bombings that
killed seven people in Britain.
   ``I have a deep sense of unease about the convictions in these
cases which do not appear to me to be safe and satisfactory,'' said
Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie in a letter to Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Runcie's office said he wrote it after being ``impressed'' by
what Cardinal Basil Hume, Catholic archbishop of Westminster, told
him about the cases.
   Hume said Thursday he asked for the cases to be reopened at a
meeting with Hurd. Hume was accompanied by four former top officials
of the judicial system who expressed doubt about the convictions.
   The archbishops said evidence pointing to the innocence of the
four was never put to the jury; that convictions were based solely
on confessions that could have been induced by beatings and drugs;
and that two IRA men convicted in another case, Joe O'Connell and
Brendon Dowd, claimed they carried out the bombings and had never
heard of the other four.
   Hurd's office said he was considering the pleas and was unlikely
to decide before Christmas.
   The bombings at three pubs frequented by soldiers killed seven
people and injured 134 in 1974. Two pubs were in Guildford, 30 miles
southwest of London, and one in Woolwich, east London.
   Carole Richardson, 29, Patrick Armstrong, 36, Paul Hill, 34, and
Gerry Conlon, 33, who still protest their innocence, were jailed for
life in 1975 for the Guildford bombings and Hill and Armstrong also
for the Woolwich blast.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army has said it has bombed targets
in mainland Britain as well as Northern Ireland, where it is
fighting to end British rule.

   The Food and Drug Administration is telling
aspirin makers to warn women not to take the popular pain killer
during the last three months of pregnancy lest they risk prolonged
labor and unnecessary bleeding.
   Aspirin products already must carry the standard warning: ``As
with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby seek the advice
of a health professional before using this product.''
   This additional wording would be required under the FDA proposal
issued Thursday: ``IMPORTANT: Do not take this product during the
last three months of pregnancy unless directed by a doctor. Aspirin
taken near the time of delivery may cause bleeding problems in both
mother and child.''
   A similar warning already is required for ibuprofen, the pain
reliever used in such products as Advil and Nuprin.

   A study that found Seventh-day Adventists can
expect to live longer suggests that others who adopt the healthful
lifestyle of the religious group may also extend their life spans.
   Practicing Seventh-day Adventists abstain from smoking and
drinking alcoholic beverages, and many adopt a vegetarian or
near-vegetarian diet. This approach had a significant association
with life expectancy, said Jan W. Kuzma, a professor of vital
statistics at Loma Linda University in California.
   His study calculated life tables for a group of 27,514
Seventh-day Adventists _ 9,804 males and 17,710 females older than
age 30 who enrolled in a study in 1960. Kuzma followed up on that
study through 1985 by checking California death records and compared
the life expectancies to the general California population.
   Kuzma found that a 35-year-old male Seventh-day Adventist was
likely to live to be 82, nine more years than the average California
white male. For females, the advantage was 7.6 years longer.

   A nationwide search for four young adults
ended with the recovery of bodies from a car in a river. But
questions remain whether the accident was a deadly combination of
underage drinking and a missing safety barrier.
   A car containing what authorities believed were the bodies of the
four young people was found Thursday in 15 feet of water on the
bottom of Mill River.
   The three women and one man, who were age 20 or younger, were
last seen by their parents Saturday night, when they left their
hometown of East Lyme for a night in New Haven.
   Police have determined the four spent at least part of Saturday
night drinking at a bar near Yale University. The legal drinking age
in Connecticut is 21. State police Detective Andre Trudelle said a
bar employee told authorities the four left the bar together about 3
a.m. Sunday.
   Their car apparently traveled down Chapel Street, went over a
concrete barrier that was in place Thursday and plunged into the
river, city police Lt. James Sorrentino said. The street has been a
dead end for years because the Chapel Street bridge is out of
service.
   Officials said the bridge pivots open on a center axis to allow
water traffic to pass and has been in its open position for years.

<HEAD>Collapse of Housing Values?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the enduring myths of the single-family
housing market is that prices periodically collapse, wiping out the
only real asset that many families possess.
   Books have been written about it. One author, in fact, has hired
out as a consultant, advertising himself as the guru who foresaw the
great real estate collapse of the early 1980s, which never occurred.
   There have been local and even regional declines. There have been
sharp short-term declines that are corrected within a few years.
There have been weak markets. And conceivably there could be a
collapse in the future.
   There exists also the situation in which the value of a house
might have spurted from $50,000 to $100,000 in two years, and then
retreated to $90,000 or even $85,000. Despite the sizable gain, this
sometimes is called a collapse.
   But examining the record over the past few decades, nothing
qualifies as a national single-family housing market collapse.
   Fueling the collapse speculation has been the spectacular rises
in certain regions, particularly the Northeast and New England,
which more than coincidentally are the home grounds of a good many
financial analysts.
   But, as housing and real estate people are becoming hoarse from
shouting, intelligent financial analysts should not project regional
or local factors, especially when these factors are extreme, into a
national phenomenon.
   Ken Colton, executive vice president of the National Assocation
of Home Builders, observes that especially high land and development
prices in California and the Northeast account in part for the
prices in those areas.
   Moreover, while regions of the United States fell into a serious
recession during the mid-1980s, much of California and the
Northeast, especially New England, enjoyed boom times. There were
reasons, therefore, for high prices.
   A common argument from the financial community makes the
assumption that housing should be considered only as an investment,
and then to measure price in relation to yield.
   On such a basis, they say, the rents obtainable from a house do
not justify the price. That is, should a homeowner choose to rent
the property it would be impossible to obtain sufficient rent to
justify it as an investment.
   Housing people agree, but wonder why housing should be viewed
simply as an investment when it so obviously is more than that.
   ``Housing is a usable and essential commodity compared to a stock
or bond, which really has no useful puurpose other than to add to
one's investment portfolio,'' says Colton.
   A home, he observes, provides essential shelter and security.
``Its value as an investment, although important, is nonetheless a
secondary benefit for most Americans.''
   Moreover, unlike paper investments, houses are not bought and
sold in seconds. People do not dump their houses on the market en
masse and sit on the curb all night. The market is relatively
protected from mass hysteria.
   Could there be a national housing price collapse? Unlikely,
especially in isolation from the general condition of the economy as
a whole.
   One concern of housing economists is the inability of young
couples to enter the market. Homebuying by first-timers continues to
slip, and the reason why is obvious: Prices are high in relation to
incomes.
   A healthy housing market requires access for first-timers. They
are the base, the first rung of the mobility ladder. Without them,
the rung of owners just above cannot move up to more expensive
housing.
   Such a situation could mean every tier of the market could slip
to a lower rung, but that would hardly constitute a crash.
   True, it might mean a sudden adjustment, but it would be
self-correcting, too, since first-timers finally could get their
foot on the first rung.

<DATELINE>LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It happened in a violent flash, as
James and a friend were walking up steep, dark stairs toward a gay
bar after a midnight walk along the beach.
   Two young men with close-cropped hair suddenly attacked them from
behind. Yelling, ``You're going to die, faggot,'' they bludgeoned
James with a blunt object that struck his head with the force of a
lead pipe.
   Several of his teeth were knocked out. His left eye was so badly
damaged that doctors had to remove it. His friend suffered minor
injuries.
   ``Emotionally, I think it would be a lot easier to accept if they
were just trying to rob me,'' said James, 45, sitting in his Irvine
apartment recently, a black eye patch covering his left eye. He
spoke on condition his last name not be used.
   ``This is different. This is against me as a person. It's
something I live with every minute, every second.''
   The attack was the third of the summer on gays in Laguna Beach, a
coastal resort 50 miles southwest of Los Angeles. But gay activists,
police and crime victim counselors say Laguna Beach is not alone.
   From San Francisco to New York, reports of crimes targeted at
homosexuals have increased dramatically in the last four years, up
300 percent by one estimate, in what gay leaders see as a violent
reaction to the AIDS crisis.
   Commonly called ``gay bashing,'' the reports range from
late-night beatings and slurs yelled in streets to more subtle acts,
such as one community's effort to remove homosexuals from protection
under a human rights ordinance, gay activists say.
   ``I'm not sure that people hate us any more than they ever did,
but it's certainly easier now to express that hate,'' said John
Fall, a spokesman for the activist group ACT UP@LA.
   An audit by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington
shows reports of gay crimes and harassment have more than tripled in
three years, from 2,042 cases in 1985 to 7,008 cases last year.
   Centers that counsel gay-bashing victims in Los Angeles, San
Francisco and New York also report record numbers of cases. Police
in New York report fewer attacks than gay activists, but also show
the attacks about tripling in recent years.
   One area well acquainted with gay bashing is West Hollywood,
where gay bars, clubs and restaurants line Santa Monica Boulevard.
On Friday and Saturday nights, gay men walk the sidewalks from bar
to bar as young men from the suburbs cruise the boulevard, calling
them names.
   The verbal barbs often lead to violence.
   A July 2 attack was typical, police said. At about 2 a.m., two
Beverly Hills men were beaten, one of them cut by a broken beer
bottle, by two men cruising in a pickup, police said. The attackers
yelled, ``fag,'' as they beat the men.
   Police and gay activists said it is even more dangerous in nearby
Silver Lake, where gays who frequent bars and businesses share the
streets with youth gangs.
   The bars themselves are often targets of vandals, who smash
windows and spray paint anti-gay epithets on walls and parked cars.
   ``You've got gang members there who are very macho, and this is
how they express it,'' said Capt. Mark Squiers of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department.
   Sometimes, the targets of gay bashing try to fight back.
   Duke Crestfield of San Francisco, where gay bashing reports are
at record levels, had had enough of the taunts shouted from a tour
bus, and so he boarded it. In the confrontation that followed, a
half-dozen riders punched him and smashed his glasses before dumping
him off the bus, he said.
   Often the victims of gay-bashing cases, like other hate crimes,
have emotional scars, counselors say.
   ``Many feel anger, many go through depression, anxiety, serious
sleep disorders, eating disorders, inability to focus on the job,''
said David Wertheimer, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian
Anti-Violence Project in New York City. ``They also face questions
about their own identity, questions about their sexual orientation
and the goodness of that.''
   In James' case, the June 19 attack left him worried about the
future. His reduced eyesight makes him afraid to drive at night and
gave him headaches. He worries about how he can continue to take
care of his school-age child he raises alone.
   Gay bashers find both a motivation and a vindication in AIDS,
according to activists.
   ``AIDS is perceived to be a gay disease. And as it moves out of
the gay community into other communities, it has generated a lot of
feelings of anger and hostility,'' said Laguna Beach Mayor-Pro Tem
Robert Gentry, who is gay.
   Those feelings found expression, activists said, in an effort by
a group in Irvine working to remove homosexuals from protection by
the city's human rights ordinance and in two AIDS testing
initiatives on California's November ballot.
   Voters rejected a proposal to force doctors to report AIDS
patients so that partners could be traced, but they approved an
initiative authorizing courts to compel testing of people accused of
certain crimes, which backers said would help protect rape victims
and law officers fearful they might have been exposed.
   ``People are trying to put us back in our place,'' said Lester
Olmstead-Rose, spokesman for San Francisco's Community United
Against Violence. ``It's an attempt in a crude way to make us go
back to what we used to be, which was closeted and quiet and never
talking about ourselves. That, of course, is something which we
cannot do and will not do.''
   A 1987 California law adds felony charges in cases where a
person's civil rights are abused because of their sexual preference,
ancestry, religion or race.
   In West Hollywood, the recent rise in heckling quickly prompted a
meeting between city and sheriff's department officials. In arrest
reports, sheriff's deputies now include anti-gay aspects of a crime
so that prosecutors can seek harsher penalties. Deputies also work
with a local gay organization that operates a hotline.
   ``The city is sending a clear message that we're not going to
tolerate this,'' said city spokeswoman Helen Goss. ``We're going to
prosecute you if you do this.''
   Local anti-discrimination efforts are fine, in the view of Laguna
Beach's Gentry, but he said larger issues must be resolved through
AIDS eduction.
   ``The AIDS epidemic nationally fuels the fires of hatred,'' he
said. ``I've never been so scared in my life.''

<HEAD>Asylum or Deportation for Joe Doherty?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 29th graf, bgn, The administration..., to update with
Nov. 14 defeat for government in third bid to deport Doherty to
Britain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KEARNY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Joe Doherty broke out of a maximum
security prison in Northern Ireland seven years ago, the Irish
Republican Army's underground network of safehouses and sympathizers
led him to this working class, Irish-American suburb of New York.
   Doherty had been convicted with three others of killing a British
army officer in a 1980 shootout.
   In Kearny, he lived with an American girlfriend, worked in
construction and took a part-time job at Clancy's Bar in Manhattan.
   ``It was sort of like being normal for once ... having a job and
knowing you're not going to get assassinated or stopped in the
streets because of your religion,'' Doherty said in a recent
interview at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.
   On June 28, 1983, a group of FBI agents walked into Clancy's,
ordered a round of beers and took him into custody again.
   Since then, the case has grown to involve the the White House,
the Justice Department, civil rights activists, and the leaders of
Great Britain and Ireland.
   Doherty doesn't deny being involved in the killing but says it
was a political act and that he warrants political asylum in the
United States.
   The government disagrees. The Justice Department calls Doherty a
terrorist and says he should be deported to Britain.
   ``The question of who gets political asylum and who is a refugee
should be based on the law, on facts and on circumstances,'' said
Mary Pike, Doherty's lawyer. ``But the question really depends on
which government you're fleeing. If it's a government with which the
Reagan administration wants to remain friendly, then you can't get
asylum.''
   ``If I was a Cuban,'' said Doherty, ``there's no way I would be
deported.''
   Doherty, a bachelor, has spent the better part of his 33 years in
hiding or in prison. He joined the IRA in 1969 after the British
army crushed a Catholic civil rights march on what has become known
as Bloody Sunday.
   ``I'd watched my father live his life as a second-class citizen,
and tell me to learn a trade and then emigrate,'' said Doherty. ``I
didn't want to tell my son at 17 that he had to go to Canada to find
a job because of his religion.''
   While lawyers debate his case, Doherty has spent the past five
years in a 12-foot-by-6-foot cell at the federal prison in New York.
   ``I see this case as a complete rejection of the Constitution by
the government,'' said Paul O'Dwyer, a civil rights attorney in New
York. ``There is no other prisoner I know of who has been held for
such a protracted period of time having committed no crime in the
United States.''
   Tom Moseley, a former Justice Department attorney who handled the
Doherty case, said the bottom line is that Doherty is a terrorist
who killed someone.
   ``We felt he should have been extradited to the U.K. on the
grounds of murder and assault,'' said Moseley, now in private
practice in Morristown.
   Some who sympathize with the IRA's goal of uniting the Republic
of Ireland with the northern six counties that make up the British
province of Northern Ireland consider Doherty a folk hero.
   The Justice Department went to court last year to stop
Philadelphians from naming Doherty honorary grand marshal of their
St. Patrick's Day parade.
   ``Free Joe Doherty'' graffiti adorns walls and sidewalks all over
New York City. At a New Jersey bar not far from where Doherty lived,
his picture hangs alongside that of Bobby Sands, the IRA prisoner
who starved to death during a 1981 hunger strike at a British prison.
   Among Doherty's supporters are New York's Roman Catholic
Archbishop Cardinal John O'Connor, Amnesty International, the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
visited Doherty in prison in July.
   But there also are influential forces fighting for Doherty's
extradition.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the case in talks
with President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., described the jailed IRA man as ``an
Irish Ghengis Khan.'' Lugar led a successful fight to exclude the
political exception clause from the century-old U.S.-British
extradition treaty when it was renegotiated in 1986.
   The British government filed a formal request for Doherty's
extradition in 1983. It was denied in December 1984 by U.S. District
Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn, who ruled that Doherty's crime
was a political act and qualified the defendant for political asylum.
   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight
decided in Doherty's favor. A government appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York upheld Doherty's previous victories.
   Having failed to extradite Doherty, the Justice Department began
deportation proceedings.
   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,
Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland and his decision
was upheld by immigration Judge Howard I. Cohen in 1986.
   ``If I was sent back to Ireland, I would be arrested and put in
jail,'' Doherty said. ``But hopefully it would be a humane place and
I would get a fair hearing, not like in the north.''
   The administration, this time through the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, appealed Cohen's order and again lost. Two
more appeals and two more government defeats followed, the latest
coming Nov. 14.
   Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland, under pressure from London
and Washington, in December 1987 ratified the European Convention on
Terrorism, which calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed
terrorists. That eliminated Doherty's Irish option.
   Today, Doherty is pinning his hopes on winning asylum, though
after 5{ years of court battles, he isn't too optimistic about his
chances for freedom.
   ``I go to court. I win,'' he says. ``But here I am.''

   This is the final installment of an occasional
series that has told the story of the Drought of '88 through the
eyes of one farm family, the Chases of Barry County, Michigan.

   Gordon and Jean Chase prayed for rain all
summer long. Now they pray for just a few days of sunshine.
   In June, when hot, dry winds blew the dusty dirt off seeds that
wouldn't germinate _ when the worst dry spell since the Dust Bowl of
the 1930s left crops withered and stunted _ the Chases never
expected their fields would be too muddy at harvest time.
   ``We've never seen a year like this,'' Gordon Chase says, shaking
his head. ``We've gone from the worst drought in 50 years to one of
the wettest and coldest Octobers ever. One extreme to the other.''
   From April 1 through mid-July, the Chases' 1,100-acre cash-crop
and dairy farm in southwest Michigan's Barry County received barely
an inch of rain. Since Aug. 1, about 18 inches of rain and an inch
of snow have pounded the weak stalks of corn and wilted soybeans _
more than twice the normal amount of precipitation.
   The Chases aren't alone. Many of the same Midwest farmers who
struggled through the summer's devastating drought were taunted by
rains that came too late to do any good.
   The recent downpours, which have forced many farmers to delay
harvesting their shriveled crops, bring the year to a sad, ironic
close.
   This will be the first time in the Chases' 18 years of farming
that they will have no crop to sell. Everything they harvest will be
needed to feed their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle. With only
about half a silo full of high-moisture corn _ enough to last about
three months _ the Chases will have to buy from other farmers.
   ``A year like this makes you realize more than ever that the
weather is the farmer's biggest friend or worst enemy,'' Chase says,
sinking into a recliner in the couple's living room.
   He and his wife, both 51, estimate they lost about half their
corn and soybean crop, and all of the string beans they were growing
for a canning company. Their wheat crop was harvested before the
drought hit in May.
   But the Chases don't complain.
   ``At the height of the drought, you wondered whether you'd have
anything at all,'' Chase says with a shrug.
   The loss of their cash crop represents a 30-percent cut in the
Chases' income. To compound their financial plight, their expenses
have been 20 percent higher than normal, mostly because of the money
they spent on irrigation.
   But because irrigation only helps when there's some rainfall,
``we got zero out of that,'' Chase says in disgust, recalling the
summer nights he and his son, Kurt, spent in the fields baby-sitting
the irrigation system so that no water was wasted.
   The Chases are thankful their dairy herd, which represents about
60 percent of the farm's income, is healthy and productive. The
income they make on their cash crop usually covers their operating
expenses and pays for the 700 acres of land they rent _ about
$75,000 this year.
   ``It's really frightening,'' Jean Chase says. ``We don't know
where we'll get it, but it'll work out. ... We don't dwell on it
because it reminds us how horrible that loss really is.''
   The Chases also are thankful they have an understanding lender.
They're waiting to find out if they qualify for the federal
government's $3.9 billion drought-relief aid program.
   But they can't help but think back to their early spring
projections.
   On paper, this looked like it was going to be the family's most
prosperous year ever. After managing to save their farm from
foreclosure three years ago by deeding to the Federal Land Bank and
leasing it back _ parcel by parcel _ the Chases expected this year
would be the one to pay off a sizable chunk of the debt they had
accumulated.
   Now, all they'd like to do is finish harvesting by Thanksgiving _
a goal they've met every year. It seems unlikely this time.
   The Chases, who are in a partnership with son Kurt and
daughter-in-law Dena, pray for clear skies in order to harvest the
remaining acres of corn and soybeans.
   Every time it rains _ or snows _ several dry days must follow
before it's safe to take equipment out in the fields. They've
already had equipment stuck in the mud twice.
   ``Now all we can do is pray for a freeze,'' Gordon Chase says.
``But if it snows first, that'll just insulate it and it'll stay
wet.''
   And if the fields aren't harvested in the fall, it means more
work in the spring because the fields would have to be cleared
before planting.
   Meanwhile, the corn still standing in the brown, muddy fields is
growing moldy, rendering it useless as feed for the cattle. And with
each pounding rain, more of the weak crop is ruined.
   Still, the Chases look ahead with hope.
   ``I guess the thought of giving up doesn't enter my mind,'' Chase
says. ``Even though it has been a very trying year and very
frustrating, we have a lot to be thankful for and we survive because
we know next year will be better.''

   In his penthouse office just off Times Square,
Geraldo Rivera shows off a catcher's mask given by a friend after
the televised brawl that broke his nose and sent his talk show
ratings soaring.
   Within hours, wasting no time in taking advantage of the
publicity surrounding his rearranged honker, he's taping a new
episode of ``Geraldo'' called ``Has TV Gone Too Far?'' He reruns
footage of the brawl and confronts a panel of TV critics, backed by
an audience that occasionally boos the critics.
   Rivera is a creature of irony.
   In 1986, when he opened Al Capone's secret vault on live
television, the vault was embarrassingly empty _ but the show was
the highest-rated syndicated special ever.
   Earlier this month, his NBC special on devil worship was thrashed
by critics for tastelessness. When the ratings came in, it was the
fourth highest-rated network show of the week.
   He's the butt of jokes and the object of satire. When he canceled
an appearance on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' because of his broken
nose, Dana Carvey as the ``Church Lady'' noted in the sketch,
``Geraldo Rivera couldn't be with us, so we have the next best thing
_ a monkey.''
   Rivera sighs. It seems he just can't have success and esteem, too.
   ``I always harbored a semi-secret desire to someday achieve peer
acceptance,'' he says. ``Certainly, during my years at ABC, I tried
to be as quiet as possible. I didn't do very much press at all. I
did as many kinds of Pentagon-type stories, waste-fraud-abuse
stories, I called them, `WFAs,' as I could possibly do. I devoted
all my attention to that non-flashy kind of stuff, and I still
didn't get that kind of acceptance.
   ``By the time I left ABC in December '85, I knew I'd be a rebel
forever _ the oddball. Now I don't think about it very much.''
   Rivera came on the scene in the 1970s, jumping into stories with
both feet, weeping over abused mental patients, getting chased by
security guards trying to expose the plight of migrant laborers.
   When he left ABC News, he said it was because the division's
president, Roone Arledge, had killed his ``20-20'' story about
Robert Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.
   Since then, Rivera has had a series of controversial but
successful syndicated specials, and his year-old talk show defied
the odds by muscling into the crowded field headed by ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show'' and ``Donahue.''
   His flamboyance has earned him a place in the so-called ``tabloid
TV'' genre that includes ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show,'' and Fox's
lurid quasi-newsmagazines ``A Current Affair'' and ``The Reporters.''
   ``I haven't changed, just the labels change,'' says Rivera.
```Newspunks' was the last three months. Now it's `trash TV.' ... I
remember the days when I was the `advocacy reporter,' the
`confrontation reporter' and the `ambush reporter' _ I remember that
one was around for about a year. My main point is that I'm still
doing exactly the same thing I've always been doing.''
   When Rivera expanded from syndication into network television,
the critics pounced harder than ever.
   ``I'm convinced that very often what I do, if you put a different
reporter in and they said the same words, and you had exactly the
same images, and the program was exactly the same, the reviews would
be far more benign. I think that so many times, I get reviewed and
not what I do,'' Riversa says.
   ``I just think I've found what suits me. I feel a real sense of
populism. I'm not ashamed of it. I feel the audience often thinks of
me as their surrogate or as a friend.''
   So why, if he has such a following, doesn't he tackle weightier
subjects than skinheads and transexuals?
   ``We did a two-parter on the homeless six weeks ago,'' he said.
``We do a lot of stories on subjects that are not the flash or sex
topics. I don't do the ozone depletion. I don't do the little whales
trapped off Point Barrow. There's a lot of people who could do those
stories. There's a lot of people who could do the budget deficit
better than I could.
   ``I think that as we become more successful and as the program
evolves, you're going to see a richer mix. We already moved the
talk-show genre into a harder news area. We do a lot more in terms
of crime and punishment or drug abuse or those kinds of street
problems than talk shows have ever done, certainly than day-time
talk shows have ever done.''
   Critics aside, Rivera would seem to have no reason to change. He
says his talk show will gross about $25 million this year and has
gone from 70 stations when it premiered a year ago to 178 currently.
   ``Laughing all the way to the bank,'' he says. ``Isn't that the
truth?''

   In a business that had grown accustomed to
explosive growth, 1988 has turned out to be a year of retrenchment
for the mutual fund industry.
   But the worst fears of fund managers and their millions of
shareholders after the stock market crash in 1987 have so far not
been borne out.
   Indeed, the fund industry is ``in remarkably good shape'' under
the circumstances, says Sheldon Jacobs in his investment advisory
letter No-Load Fund Investor.
   From the stock market peak at the end of August 1987 through the
end of the third quarter this year, total assets in the nation's
mutual funds declined 5.4 percent, Jacobs notes.
   Still, as Jacobs points out, the recent total of $802.36 billion
remains much larger than it was at any time before 1987.
   Along with total assets, the fund industry measures its health by
the pace of sales of new shares as compared to redemptions that
occur when investors cash out their holdings.
   Sales reported for 1988 to date have shown a drastic 57 percent
drop, but redemptions are down, too. As a result, the industry eked
out net sales of $1.5 billion for 1988 so far, against $79 billion
at the same point last year.
   What about performance, the subject closest to the hearts of fund
investors? Most managers may not be able to claim great triumphs,
but they do not have to hide their heads in shame either.
   According to the Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service, the
nearly 1,000 funds it monitors posted an average loss of 7.3 percent
over the 12 months through Sept. 30 _ a period that, of course,
includes the debacle in October 1987.
   Over the same span, the leading stock market averages and indexes
recorded declines of 14.8 percent to 18.6 percent. Just about
three-quarters of the funds did better than a 14.8 percent loss.
   An examination of the numbers prompts several conclusions, some
upbeat, others potentially worrisome.
   By diversifying into such areas as money-market investing over
the past 15 years or so, the industry appears to have cushioned
itself from the boom-bust cycles it experienced in the 1960s and
early 1970s.
   While storms in the stock market used to send floods of money out
of mutual funds altogether, a lot of that money is now evidently
transferred to money market funds.
   Stock funds, however, are not the only group that has run into
some disenchantment. Volatile spells of rising interest rates, which
translate into declining bond prices, have helped cool the boom in
bond mutual funds.
   Some analysts say that could spell trouble sooner or later for
issuers of debt securities, especially those of the high-yield or
``junk'' variety.
   ``So far this year net cash flow into bond funds has been roughly
$5 billion, compared to $43 billion last year and a peak of $120
billion in 1986,'' said Suresh Bhirud, chief investment strategist
at the investment firm of Oppenheimer & Co.
   Meanwhile, Bhirud observes, corporate takeovers and buybacks have
created a large number of junk bond offerings seeking buyers.
   ``Given that investment flows are beginning to slow, there is an
increased likelihood that one of these offerings will suffer a
serious blow due to a lack of buyers,'' he says.
   A great deal of money to finance buyouts may come from banks,
investing institutions and wealthy individuals. Nevertheless, argues
Bhirud, ``it is questionable whether professional investors can
assimilate all the potential offerings of low-quality, high-yield
bonds.''

   Christmas packages are arriving early at the
nation's theaters as movie companies try to lure holiday trade with
ghosts, hip dogs, baby dinosaurs and Bill Murray romping about in
yet another version of Charles Dickens' seasonal favorite, ``A
Christmas Carol.''
   Industry sources estimate that the holiday season will bring $300
million dollars worth of films. Why so many expensive films at
year's end?
   ``Because the six weeks from Thanksgiving through New Years Day
is the second biggest period of theater attendance, exceeded only by
summer,'' said Art Murphy, Daily Variety's financial expert. ``Those
six weeks amount to l4 percent of the year's business.
   ``It's unusual because the period includes a `chasm,' the second
week in December. That's the worst week of the year because children
are finishing school and others are Christmas shopping.''
   `Tis the season to be jolly, and the studios are responding with
a host of comedies. In ``High Spirits,'' Peter O'Toole attempts to
pass off his rundown hotel as a haunted castle, and ghosts,
including Daryl Hannah, actually appear.
   Dan Aykroyd in ``My Stepmother Is an Alien'' is a widowed
scientist who falls in love with spaceling Kim Basinger. Cybil
Shepherd discovers in ``Chances Are'' that her daughter's boyfriend,
Robert Downey Jr., is the reincarnation of her late husband.
   Also in the comedy grabbag is another treatment of the Dickens'
classic, ``A Christmas Carol.'' In Warner Bros. ``Scrooged'' Bill
Murray plays a crass TV executive who tries to exploit the Christmas
spirit but gets caught up in his own scheme.
   There's also ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,''
with Leslie Nielsen and Ricardo Montalban as opponents in a
reworking of the memorable but brief 1982 TV series ``Police Squad.''
   Michael Caine and Steve Martin team as con men on the French
Riviera in ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.''
   Ivan Reitman (``Ghost Busters'') would have us believe in
``Twins'' that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito actually are.
   Parents will be pleased to learn that two new animated features
will appear during the holidays. ``Oliver and Company,'' a new twist
on ``Oliver Twist,'' with such voices as Bette Midler and Billy
Joel, bears the Disney imprint. It's about a bunch of rather hip
dogs and a cute little kitten who tangle with a loan shark and learn
what friendship is all about.
   Steven Spielberg and George Lucas acted as executive producers on
the dinosaur epic, ``The Land Before Time,'' produced by Disney
defector Don Bluth.
   The holidays are also a time for drama since the studios bring
forth their Academy Award hopefuls before the December 31 deadline
for qualification. Here are some of the most promising:
   ``Rain Man,'' with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise as brothers on a
trip across the United States.
   ``Beaches,'' with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey as long-time
friends striving to survive marriages and careers.
   ``Mississippi Burning,'' with Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as
FBI agents investigating the murder of three civil rights workers in
the 1964 South. Based on an actual case.
   ``Talk Radio,'' Oliver Stone's (``Platoon'') version of the Eric
Bogosian play about an abrasive radio talk show host. Bogosian stars.
   ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' with Harvey Fierstein, Anne Bancroft and
Matthew Broderick in Fierstein's play about gay life in New York.
   ``Working Girl,'' with Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver and
Melanie Griffith in a drama-comedy about corporate life and love.
   The other attractions include: ``Cocoon II: The Return,'' with
most of the cast returning; and ``Tequila Sunrise'' with Mel Gibson
as a drug dealer who wants out of the business and Kurt Russell as a
narcotics cop who's his friend.
   No matter how these films fare with audiences, Daily Variety's
Murphy predicts another record year for the movie business.
   ``Grosses are already $130 million ahead of last year, and so
1988 is certain to pass the 1987 record of $4.25 billion.''

   In the garish apartments of what
once was the Eros-Center cabaret and bordello, indigent immigrants
from Eastern Europe shuffle along the hallways in kerchiefs and worn
leather caps.
   On Grosse Freiheit, the renowned row of rowdy nightclubs that
launched rock luminaries like The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix,
burned-out lightbulbs and faulty neon signs serve now only to
advertise the creeping neglect that afflicts one of the world's most
famous red-light districts.
   Along this glitzy strand once called ``The Most Sinful Mile in
the World,'' the clubs and pubs and peep-shows hanging on to life
with a dwindling clientele are furnished with tattered banquettes
and wobbly tables and darkened by windows smudged with ages of
tobacco smoke.
   Beset by AIDS fears, unemployment and a booming X-rated video
cassette market, Hamburg's famed Sankt Pauli district has fallen on
the hardest times of its colorful 150-year history.
   In the early 19th century, the no-man's land between the rival
ports of Hamburg and Altona welcomed the boisterous brood of sailors
and riggers scorned by fashionable city centers.
   But the image of outrage worn for years with pride has decayed,
leaving Sankt Pauli in much the same state of decline as other
entertainment quarters past their prime.
   Today the traces of a long life of excess appear like wrinkles on
a face that has not aged gracefully.
   Blinking colored lights from the surviving sex shops and discos
illuminate the litter and grime as clearly as the prostitutes
bundled in pastel-colored ski-suits against the brisk November winds
off the Elbe.
   Estimated to number about 2,000, or half the number a generation
ago, the women take languid draws off cigarettes or sip coffee from
foam cups while surveying a motorized stream of carousers and
curious.
   ``In the last years, because of unemployment and AIDS and a
general reduction in the money available for this kind of
entertainment, Sankt Pauli has seen a progressive decline and is
unlikely to recover from it,'' said Hans Dittrich, chief of the
Davidwache police station that stands guard at Spielbudenplatz
(Funhouse Square).
   In some ways Sankt Pauli's loss has been Hamburg's gain, as the
departure of many prostitutes and purveyors of pornography has made
way for more legitimate businesses and resulted in a decrease in
assaults, killings and other serious crimes, Dittrich said.
   ``We still have 10 or 12 purse-snatchings or unarmed assaults
each month, but the trend has been one of decline,'' the police
official said in an interview. ``I would characterize Sankt Pauli
now as one of the safer areas of the city. Tourists have no need to
fear leaving their cars here and walking around for a look at what
used to be unique.''
   The region's reputation now draws more gawkers than stalkers, a
trend that frustrates the economy of Sankt Pauli while maintaining
its bustling appearance by night.
   Sankt Pauli veterans complain that the area with its famed
Reeperbahn strip survives today merely as a tourist attraction.
   ``Why would a guy want to sit in a cabaret and have to pay
hundreds of marks to drink champagne when he can rent the same thing
on a video cassette and watch it at home?'' asks Edwin Ross, who for
33 years has painted nude murals and signboards for Sankt Pauli's
sex theaters. ``The only people here now are first-time visitors who
remember a Reeperbahn that no longer exists.''
   ``It's unfortunate we cannot stay open at night when the women
who come here out of curiosity are looking into our windows,'' said
Eva-Maria Roepke, operator of a designer lingerie and cosmetics
store on the Reeperbahn.
   West German law dictates that sales outlets must close by 6:30
p.m. on weekdays and stay open for only a few hours on Saturday
mornings.
   Ms. Roepke's shop has been hard-hit by the closure of
Eros-Center, one of the region's two largest houses of prostitution.
   ``There used to be 600 girls around the corner, but now there are
only immigrants who have no money to spend on goods like these,''
she lamented, gesturing toward the skimpy and shimmering
nightclothes adorning the walls.
   Eros-Center owner Wilhelm Bartels told the magazine Der Spiegel
when he shuttered the sprawling sex shop last year that ``AIDS has
finished off Sankt Pauli.''
   While the health threat has cut deeply into the volume of sex
trade in the region, the economy has followed with a devastating
finishing blow.
   West Germany suffers from an 8 percent unemployment rate, and the
nature of the merchant marine has shifted over the past two decades
to a fleet comprised more often of married family men than the
single sailors and stevedores of the past.
   A nationwide liberalization 20 years ago made prostitution legal
between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., injecting a degree of regularity and even
legitimacy into the ancient profession.
   Precinct chief Dittrich says prostitutes have formed self-help
groups that work with state officials to offer social security
benefits to those willing to pay taxes on their income and to
educate young women about health risks like the AIDS virus.
   The aura of acceptability has taken some of the mysticism out of
what the Germans used to call ``Tingeltangel,'' a European
forerunner of honky-tonk.
   With the departure of most of the major sex theaters here have
come a number of alternatives appealing to a broader public, like
the Caribbean beat of Sam Brasil's live music club and Hamburg's
leading discotheque at Kaiserkeller, where The Beatles introduced
their immortal sounds in the early 1960s before crossing the street
to play at the Star Club, where they rocketed to international fame.
   The Broadway musical ``Cats'' has drawn crowds at the
Operettenhaus since 1985, and a sprawling carnival covers the
grounds of Heiligengeistfeld (Spirits' Field) three times each year,
including during the busy November-December Christmas season.
   Some Sankt Pauli merchants, however, are skeptical of the
region's chances for saving itself.
   ``Our best days are over,'' says Ross, the 63-year-old erotic
painter known to his neighbors as the Rubens of the Reeperbahn.
   Ross' work reflects the evolution of the district and some
merchants' efforts to ride with a changing tide. Ross says most of
his business now is in painting signs for doughnut shops and discos
or making portraits from photographs to be hung in private homes.
   ``There's no more business with cabarets,'' says the artist who
came here in 1955 from East Germany, where he earned his living
painting model workers and Communist giants like Marx, Engels and
Lenin.
   The daytime scene attests to a grim economic future, with streets
empty of all but derelicts and discarded fast-food wrappers wafting
in the curls of breeze brushing the curbstones.
   ``You can't make this into a Moulin Rouge, with fancy shows for
which you have to pay 20 or 30 dancers,'' says Ross. ``For Sankt
Pauli those days are unfortunately in the past.''

   Major central banks are riding to the dollar's
rescue in a united buying spree that has helped stabilized the
weakening currency, although analysts warned the recovery might be
short-lived because of acute concerns about the U.S. trade and
budget deficits.
   The coordinated worldwide buying of dollars Thursday by central
banks appeared to be the heaviest since the spring, and it lent some
support to the slumping stock market.
   Some economists also predicted the Federal Reserve would boost
U.S. interest rates to further defend the beleaguered dollar.

   Energy futures analysts remain skeptical that
current OPEC talks will result in an accord to lower production and
bolster world crude prices.
   Oil futures prices sagged Thursday, pressured by fear that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might flood the
markets with more oil and bring about a price collapse.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
tumbled 38 cents to settle at $13.29 per barrel. The contract had
fallen 23 cents on Wednesday. Other contract months also declined
sharply Thursday, with next October's contract down 87 cents at
$12.70.
   Futures prices of refined products were lower across the board.
The December contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 45.65 cents a
gallon, down 0.85 cent from Wednesday's close.
   The December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which rose
0.07 cent on Wednesday, fell 1.50 cents to close at 42.97 cents a
gallon.
   Analysts said the market opened weakly, reflecting negative
investor reaction to threats by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members
that they would start dumping more oil on world markets if a quota
agreement among members was not reached.
   Saudi Arabia produces just over half of its capacity of
approximately 10 million barrels a day. Because of falling crude
prices its oil revenue has plunged.
   The threats came as two OPEC committees began meeting Thursday in
Vienna to hammer out an accord that would limit production and
bolster oil prices. Those talks will culminate with a meeting of all
13 OPEC ministers starting Monday.
   Analysts said prices weakened further shortly after the meeting
convened about 1 p.m. EST in response to a statement by Iraqi Oil
Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, who told reporters before
the closed-door meeting began: ``It's very clear our position hasn't
changed.''
   The Iraqis have refused to abide by the cartel's quota system,
which analysts have said is the biggest stumbling block to reaching
a production accord.
   Thursday's meeting adjourned late in the day without any
announcements and the ministers were not expected to convene again
formally until Saturday.
   ``Having started out with negative news and not being given any
positive news during the day, the market sagged under the
pressure,'' said Mary L. Haskins, assistant vice president at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Overproduction has depressed the price of crude by more than 25
percent in 1988 below OPEC's $18 a barrel benchmark price.
   OPEC is estimated to be producing more than 21 million barrels
per day of oil and market analysts have said that the cartel must
cut back to around 17-18 million barrels to raise prices.

<HEAD>Questions and Answers on the Falling Dollar</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Dollar-Markets Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For a currency as powerful as the dollar, the prospect of it
``weakening,'' or worse yet ``falling,'' conjures up frightening
images of economic collapse.
   What does it mean when money is suddenly worth less?
   And what is all this about buying and selling dollars? For most
of us, dollars are used to buy things, settle debts and reward
children for good report cards. The idea that the currency itself is
a commodity whose value is determined on the open market is hard to
fathom.
   Yet the buying and selling of dollars in foreign exchange markets
is fundamental to establishing the value of a currency. And that
process is key to inflation and interest rates.
   Is a falling dollar good or bad for Americans? The answer,
economists suggest, is _ it all depends.
   Here are some questions and answers about the dollar's recent
decline:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Q. Who determines the exchange-rate value of the dollar?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. Until 1971, its value was rigidly set, first to a certain
weight of gold and later to exchange rates of other major nations'
currencies. But since then, its price has floated, determined by
market forces.
   Each day, hundreds of billions of dollars are bought and sold by
traders in foreign exchange markets.
   These traders are usually commercial banks or other large
institutional buyers that trade currencies seeking to profit on
fluctuating values. Central banks like the Federal Reserve or the
Bank of Japan also get involved when an exaggerated move by a
currency requires them to buy or sell the currency to stabilize the
market. Lately, for instance, central banks have been countering a
sell-off of dollars by buying the currency.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Q. What makes a dollar ``strong'' or ``weak?''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. The dollar is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as
any commodity traded openly. Heavy buying of dollars on exchange
markets drives up its price, making it ``strong'' compared to other
currencies. Selling dollars sends the price down, making it ``weak.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Q. So what's better, a strong dollar or a weak dollar?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. It depends. A strong dollar makes Americans' cash go further
overseas and reduces import prices _ generally good for U.S.
consumers and for foreign manufacturers.
   If the dollar is overvalued, as nearly all economists agree it
was in the early 1980s, U.S. products are harder to sell abroad and
at home, where they compete with low-cost imports. That helped give
the United States its record-breaking trade deficit.
   A weak dollar can restore competitiveness to American products by
making foreign goods comparatively more expensive. But too weak a
dollar can spawn inflation, first through higher import prices and
then through spiraling prices for all goods.
   Even worse, a falling dollar can drive foreign investors away
from U.S. securities, which lose value along with the dollar.
Foreign investment is critically needed to help finance the large
U.S. budget deficit.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Q. What has been the Reagan administration's policy on the</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   dollar?
   A. The administration until early 1987 actually promoted a weaker
dollar to help balance trade accounts. But in Feburary 1987 it
agreed that further declines in the dollar could lead to renewed
inflation. It joined its trading partners in the ``Louvre accord''
to try to hold the dollar steady.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Q. Why has the dollar fallen in the wake of George Bush's</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   election?
   A. Now that the election has been decided, traders who buy and
sell dollars are looking for signals on how the new president will
deal with the budget and trade deficits. Until some clear policy
direction is established on those two economic problems, traders may
continue to sell dollars.
   Although Bush has moved swiftly to name key economic advisers to
his staff in an effort to calm the markets, one economist who
counseled him during the campaign, Martin Feldstein, called just
last week for a further decline in the dollar to cut the trade
deficit.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added to the anxiety in
the market by saying this week that urgent efforts were needed to
reduce the budget deficit.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Q. If the dollar's value is solely set by market forces, what</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   steps can governments take to stabilize it?
   A. Through two basic ways: exchange-market intervention and
coordinated interest-rate changes.
   Intervention is the direct buying or selling of currencies by
central banks. If the purchases are large enough, that can influence
prices directly. When the Fed, or the Bank of Japan, or the West
German Bundesbank, buys dollars directly, that reduces the supply of
dollars available and sends up the price.
   Changes in interest rates affect exchange rates more subtly. But
generally, high interest rates in the United States, compared to low
interest rates abroad, will attract money to dollar-denominated
investments. That raises the value of the dollar.
   Investors will flock to where they can get the highest return.

<TEXT>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.'s lawsuit over
RJR Nabisco Inc. management's giant buyout plan is one of the
strongest signs yet that corporate bondholders are reconsidering
their role in the multibillion dollar takeover frenzy fueled by
borrowed money.
   The lawsuit filed Thursday by Met Life, one of the biggest U.S.
insurance companies and a major holder of RJR Nabisco long-term
bonds, alleges the risky $20.7 billion plan unfairly depressed the
value of those bonds.
   The suit came one day after ITT Corp. sued RJR Nabisco for
related reasons.
   Met Life's action was considered significant because the insurer
has made profitable investments in other debt-financed takeover
situations, but is now re-evaluating that strategy in light of the
unprecedented RJR Nabisco deal.
   ``I'd say bond purchasers, like investors in general, may be
looking at this activity as different from activities in the past,''
David Versfelt, a lawyer who specializes in creditor litigation,
said in reaction to the lawsuit. ``We're in a new world and people
are going to look at things differently.''
   At a news conference, Met Life President John J. Creedon accused
RJR Nabisco's top managers of recklessly proceeding with a plan that
if successful not only would enrich them and their investment
bankers, but also would quadruple the company's debt to $23 billion.
The prospect of that huge new debt has raised concern about the
company's ability to pay existing bond obligations.
   Creedon said such concerns already had wiped $1 billion in market
value from RJR Nabisco corporate bonds, including $40 million in
losses for Met Life's own portfolio of $340 million in Nabisco
long-term debt securities. The lawsuit demands restitution of those
losses.
   ``RJR has gone to the well of public debt for many years, and now
they're trying to poison it,'' he said.
   Officials at RJR Nabisco's headquarters in Atlanta declined to
comment on the suit, saying the company did not comment on pending
litigation.
   The suit names as defendants both RJR Nabisco and its chief
executive officer, F. Ross Johnson. Johnson stunned the finance
world last month by proposing a management-led leveraged buyout of
the nation's 19th largest industrial company, which makes items
ranging from Winston cigarettes to Ritz crackers.
   A leveraged buyout is an increasingly popular high-finance
transaction in which an acquirer uses borrowed money to buy all
stock of a company and repays the debt through the company's
earnings, by asset sales or a combination of both.
   Such LBOs often provide staggering profits for owners of a
target's stock, leaving a much smaller, privately-owned company
saddled with a much higher debt load.
   The size and complexity of RJR Nabisco's planned buyout, combined
with the uncertain outlook for interest rates and the economy, have
incited criticisms that debt-financed takeovers may have reached an
excessive, indiscriminate pace.
   The Met Life lawsuit contended the RJR Nabisco proposal has
``already resulted in a loss of confidence in the market for
investment grade obligations of America's leading companies, and is
widely recognized as a threat to the integrity of our financial
markets.''
   Creedon told reporters he believes the frenzied level of
leveraged buyouts could subvert America's capital formation system,
and that it warrants federal government scrutiny.
   That is another reason Met Life felt compelled to take legal
action, he said.
   ``It's time to step back and look at the process,'' he said.
``We're trying to send a message here.''
   Responding to reporters' questions, Creedon conceded Met Life
itself had been an early investor in some leveraged buyouts, some of
which have done well. He also said Met Life owns 186,000 shares of
RJR Nabisco stock, which has gained about $5 million in value since
the leveraged buyout plans were disclosed in October.
   ``Of course what happened is the stock went up,'' he said. ``But
whether or not it offsets the losses in bonds, those are two
different interests.''
   Creedon also said Met Life was re-evaluating its investment
position regarding debt-financed takeovers. ``We will carefully
consider LBOs in the future with a more jaundiced eye,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. may have found a white
knight buyer in ConAgra Inc., but a counterattack by hostile suitor
Tyson Foods Inc. is not out of the question, analysts say.
   Holly Farms announced Thursday the poultry processor had agreed
to a $1 billion stock swap buyout by Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra, a
major diversified food company.
   The acquisition, which must be approved by Holly Farms and
ConAgra shareholders, if successful would thwart the hostile $52 a
share offer valued at $941 million being waged by Tyson, of
Springdale, Ark.
   Tyson issued a statement saying it would have no immediate
comment on the proposal, and analysts speculated it was not out of
the picture yet.
   ``I don't think it's clear cut right now,'' said Napoleon
Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan Co. in Memphis.
   ConAgra, a diversified company with more than 60 percent of its
business in prepared foods, is offering an exchange of stock, the
value of which will be figured in January, while Tyson is offering
cash now, Overton said.
   Tyson's offer was to expire today, but Overton said Tyson might
be ready to raise it.
   ``They definitely look like they're willing to pay $54 a share in
cash. That's the key point, no matter whether there is a formal bid
on the table or not,'' he said.
   John McMillin, an analyst with Predential-Bache Securities in New
York, said ConAgra's offer would amount to $55 a share for Holly
Farms 18.1 million shares of common stock, based on Thursday's
market prices.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Holly Farms fell 87{
cents a share to $51.87{ while ConAgra dropped $1.25 a share to
$27.62{.
   McMillin said it was clear that Holly Farms management, led by
company president R. Lee Taylor II, will continue to oppose Tyson.
   He said he believed that ConAgra had the upper hand because of
its operating style, in which each operating division is given wide
autonomy.
   Market analysts say Taylor and Tyson Chairman Don Tyson have
different business styles, and McMillin said Holly Farms' management
likely would be replaced if Tyson took over.
   Holly Farms has 50 percent of its business in processed chicken
and the ConAgra acquisition would push Holly Farms' share of the
branded chicken market from 18 percent to about 25 percent, McMillin
said.
   ``It gives a lot of clout within the supermarket,'' he said.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processer, produces 14
million pounds of chicken a week.
   Market observers say Holly Farms has been looking for a friendly
takeover since Tyson on Oct. 18 made its initial offer of $45 plus a
quarter share of Tyson stock for each Holly Farms share.
   ``I would suspect that Holly Farms approached ConAgra,'' Overton
said.
   The acquisition agreement calls for exchanging 1.875 to 2 shares
of ConAgra stock for each share of Holly Farms stock. Holly Farms
has 18.1 million shares outstanding.
   ``This transaction provides higher value for our shareholders,
significantly higher value, than the other available alternative,''
said Ted Bailey, a spokesman for Holly Farms.
   Holly Farms had total sales last year of $1.6 billion while
ConAgra registered total sales of $9.5 billion. Tyson had sales of
$1.8 billion.

   Pampered turkeys gobble to visitors and
walk willingly into the slaughterhouse at Kauffman Poultry Farms,
where farm operators say a happy bird is a tastier bird.
   This 55-year-old family farm will market about 60,000
Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday turkeys, nearly all sold fresh to
gourmet meat markets.
   ``One of our claims to fame is that we do it all here, taking
good care of those little birds from Day One,'' said manager Tom
Klopfenstein, who has worked at this 600-acre north-central Illinois
farm for 23 years. ``We know they'll end up a premium bird.''
   Tiny turkeys spend their early days gathered around warm stoves,
then move outdoors for exercise and a low-fat diet that includes
corn grown on the farm. Workers are with them daily until they reach
market weight in about four months.
   There's a reason for the pampered poultry: Klopfenstein believes
reduced stress means better meat.
   Klopfenstein said many producers raise birds in confinement, give
them feed that produces more fat, pack them into cages and truck
them to slaughterhouses.
   High school students walk turkeys into the slaughterhouse at
Kauffman Poultry Farms.
   ``They're not concerned about anything until we hang them on the
line, and then they're dead in a few seconds,'' said Klopfenstein.
   Cleaned, defeathered and wrapped, these turkeys soon are on their
way to meat markets around northern Illinois or to Kauffman's retail
shop on the farm. About 1,000 turkeys are sold there at $1.29 a
pound _ well over the typical price for a frozen supermarket turkey,
said Klopfenstein.
   ``They do a good job of marketing and promoting their product and
people are willing to pay more for it,'' said Carl Parsons, a
University of Illinois poultry specialist.
   But Parsons says he doen't agree with the theory that less stress
on turkeys produces better meat.
   Klopfenstein said turkey production in the United States has
increased because consumers believe turkey is healthier and cheaper
than red meat. The National Turkey Federation says per capita
consumption has increased from 1.5 pounds in 1930 to about 16.5
pounds in 1988.
   Klopfenstein said the biggest change has been rapid weight-gain
and large percentage of white breast meat due to genetic and feeding
improvements.
   U.S. farmers earned $1.7 billion raising 240 million turkeys in
1987 _ 698,000 of them in Illinois. The industry is dominated by
major producers who market millions of birds each as everything from
turkey ham and hotdogs to frozen whole turkeys.
   Howard Kauffman raised the first Ho-Ka turkeys on the family farm
in 1933, slaughtering them in his basement. The farm now raises
about 100,000 turkeys a year.
   Ironically, the heat and drought that cut crop yields this year
helped the turkey business.
   ``It fully sterilized the ground outside and inside the buildings
and prevented diseases,'' said Klopfenstein.

<HEAD>Rumors About Withdrawal of Major Bidder Send Stock Tumbling</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today's deadline for submitting bids to acquire
RJR Nabisco Inc. heightened the already brimming tension surrounding
the buyout battle for the huge food and tobacco conglomerate.
   The company's stock declined for the second straight session
Thursday amid rumors that one of two known bidders in the
multibillion-dollar takeover fight might end its campaign.
   Trading in RJR Nabisco stock was halted on the New York Stock
Exchange at 1 p.m. because the number of sell orders swamped buy
orders. Trading resumed 34 minutes later when the order imbalance
eased, Big Board officials said.
   The stock, which lost $4.50 a share on Wednesday, finished down
another $1.25 to finish at $82.75 in heavy trading.
   Brokers said rumors surfaced that leveraged buyout specialist
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. might withdraw its $90-a-share, $20.3
billion tender offer for RJR Nabisco.
   Heightening the stock market's nervousness was today's bidding
deadline imposed by the company's special committee of outside
directors considering buyout offers.
   Kohlberg spokesman Thomas Daly said that ``the policy of the firm
is not to comment on rumors in the marketplace.''
   Speculators in RJR Nabisco stock, which has soared more than 40
percent in value since the takeover battle began last month, feared
that Kohlberg's withdrawal would leave only one bid left, a
$92-a-share, $20.7 billion offer from the company's senior
management.
   Many had been betting that Kohlberg or an unidentified third
party might make an even bigger offer.
   Rising uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of the biggest
takeover attempt in history intensified Wednesday when Forstmann
Little & Co., a key Kohlberg rival in the takeover business that had
indicated it led a group that might bid for RJR Nabisco, said it
would not submit an offer.
   The Wall Street Journal said Thursday that a bid might emerge
from a group consisting of First Boston Corp. and Resource Holdings
Ltd., two New York investment firms. Neither would comment on the
report.
   Securities analysts following the maneuvering said still there
was some possibility that the RJR Nabisco management group might
join Kohlberg to make a single bid, although previous negotiations
for such an alliance have collapsed several times.
   RJR Nabisco's president and chief executive officer, F. Ross
Johnson, who leads the managers trying to buy the company, has the
backing of the investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Atlanta-based RJR, the nation's 19th largest industrial concern,
makes such well-known brands as Winston and Camel cigarettes, Oreo
cookies and Del Monte vegetables.
   If any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company, it would be
the biggest corporate acquisition ever. The RJR Nabisco management
and Kohlberg Kravis bids dwarf the $13.4 billion spent in the 1984
acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. by what is now Chevron Corp.

<HEAD>Those Beeping Buttons Celebrate 25 Years In A Pressing Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years ago today, AT&T told
Americans to reach out and touch some buttons by introducing
Touch-Tone telephones.
   The invention of the transistor in 1947 led to a 10-year
development period that culminated in the Nov. 18, 1963 announcement
that pushbutton telephone service would begin in two small
Pennsylvania communities, Carnegie and Greensburg, said Bell
Laboratories spokeswoman Maureen Lynch in Short Hills.
   ``We all thought it was pretty great stuff,'' said J.H. Ham, who
supervised the design and marketing of the phones for Bell Labs,
AT&T's research arm. He spoke by Touch-Tone phone from his home in
Indianapolis, where he retired in 1984 after 42 years with AT&T.
   ``We all felt that we were on the forefront of a new service,''
he said Thursday.
   Fifty-five percent of residential phones now are tone dial,
according to industry figures. The rest are rotary or push-button
phones that dial by pulse.
   Creation of the tone dialing system has led to other consumer
technologies.
   Banks, airlines, railroads and other businesses have answering
systems that allow callers to receive information or leave a message
by pressing the appropriate digit. Tone phones also can be used to
retrieve messages from some types of phone answering machines, thus
doing away with separate tone devices.
   Preceding the new services were years of complex research and
testing in areas ranging from the proper type of tone to the
arrangement of the pushbuttons on the phone itself.
   AT&T had experimented with push-button phones since the 1890s,
but the idea was first explored seriously in the early 1950s, and
researchers at Bell Labs developed the equipment from 1958 to 1961,
Ham said. At least two more years were required for final product
development and testing.
   The main development was the ability to send signals _ pitched
tones _ while the connection was being made.
   Design of the phone itself included work by engineers and
psychologists to find the button arrangement that would lead to the
fastest and most accurate dialing.
   A small difference in speed, multiplied countless times over,
takes up more time in the phone network and thus costs more, said
Blake Wattenbarger, the psychologist who supervises the human
factors group at Bell Labs in Holmdel.
   Researchers studied putting the buttons in a circle to mimic the
rotary dial or in an upside-down triangle. They considered two
columns, either with odd on one side and even on the other, or 1-5
on the left and 6-9 and 0 on the right.
   More than a dozen arrangements were tested, until researchers
settled on the present top-to-bottom rectangular arrangement, said
Wattenbarger.
   For the beep to register a digit at a central telephone facility,
a button must be held for at least one-twentieth of a second, he
said. Thus, the buttons had to be designed to make sure the tone
would sound long enough.
   Dialers also were found to prefer being able to hear the tones so
they could know the signals were being transmitted. And the tones
had to be created so that the receiving equipment would not confuse
them with the sound of a human voice, Wattenbarger said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
early European trading today, one day after concerted intervention
by central banks to prop it up. Gold prices fell.
   In London, dealers said that despite the dollar's rise, sentiment
remained bearish toward the currency.
   ``I think we are just going to see consolidation today,'' said
Steve Kelleher, an analyst at Chemical Bank in London.
   The dollar fell Thursday, a day after the U.S. trade figures
showed a smaller fall in the deficit than the market wanted.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged up today on reported central bank intervention to
finish at 122.40 yen, a rise of 0.88 yen from a 15-year closing low
on Thursday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.05 yen.
   ``Coordinated overnight intervention by central banks around the
world helped push the dollar up,'' said King Ogino, a dealer at
Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. He added that the Bank of Japan had
continued buying dollars today.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7435 West German marks, up from 1.7298; 1.4633
Swiss francs, up from 1.4518; 5.9585 French francs, up from 5.9075;
1.9615 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9560; 1.295.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,291.75; and 1.2315 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2335.
   In London, the dollar gained more than a cent against the British
pound, which was quoted at $1.8095, compared with $1.8227 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.50 a troy ounce,
down from $422 bid late Thursday, and showed scant movement in later
trading. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $419.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $419.90, down from $421 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell by $3.11 an ounce to close at a
bid price of $421.23.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.22 a troy
ounce, down from late Thursday's $6.29.

<HEAD>Central Bank Intervention Props Up Dollar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supported by central bank intervention, the U.S.
dollar today recouped some of its losses from the previous day, when
it dove to its lowest closing in Tokyo against the Japanese yen.
   Meanwhile, stocks surged to another record high today.
   The dollar finished the week at 122.40 yen, up 0.88 yen from its
121.52-yen Thursday closing. It opened the day at 122.15 yen and
traded between 122.07 and 122.60 yen during the day.
   ``Coordinated overnight intervention by central banks around the
world helped push the dollar up,'' said King Ogino, a dealer at
Goldman Sachs. He said continued dollar buying by the Bank of Japan
today also served to bolster the U.S. currency.
   The dollar has lost 3.48 yen in Tokyo since the start of
November, and on Thursday dipped to 121.52 yen, its lowest closing
since modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940s.
   The Bank of Japan intervention came after Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the central bank and other major currency countries
were poised to intervene in the market should the U.S. currency
continue its nose dive.
   Ogino said the dollar also was buoyed by unconfirmed rumors from
New York of an agreement at an alleged secret meeting Nov. 14 among
high-ranking monetary authorities that the dollar should trade
between 120 and 140 yen.
   ``The report is unconfirmed but it had good timing'' to bolster
the dollar, he said.
   But he said the dollar was likely to take another beating against
the yen next week ``as speculators may test new lows for the
currency.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 103.39 points or 0.36 percent to 29,180.20. The closing level
was the sixth straight record high for the index.
   Dealers attributed the strong performance to confidence in
Japan's economy. Today's rally was led mainly by large capital
issues, especially steels, they said.
   ``But the Nikkei won't break the 30,000-point too soon,'' one
dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Stock prices were little changed Friday after the
government reported inflation rose 0.5 percent in October.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 1.4
points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,822.2 at midday.
   Volume was moderate and 360.5 million shares changed hands,
compared with 280.2 million at the same time Thursday.
   Trading began on a positive note, helped by steady performances
in overseas stock and foreign exchange markets.
   Persistent weakness in the dollar despite concerted intervention
by central banks has reawakened worries about the course of interest
rates, both in the United States and in Britain, dealers said.
   Traders were relieved by the government's report showing
Britain's inflation rose to an annual rate of 6.4 percent in October
from 5.9 percent in September, dealers said. The market had expected
an increase of that magnitude.

   Anchor Savings Bank has agreed to be acquired for
$170 million in cash by the Hamilton Holding Co., whose principal
owner controls Ensign Bank and Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
   The two institutions would have combined assets of $10.3 billion
and branches throughout the Atlantic seaboard, making it one of the
nation's five largest savings institutions.
   Under the agreement announced late Thursday, Hamilton would pay
$9.75 a share in cash for all of Anchor's outstanding common shares.
In addition, Hamilton was granted an option to acquire about a
million shares of a new issue of common stock, also at $9.75 a
share, according to a news release.
   The offer requires approval from regulators and stockholders.
   Anchor, which is among the nation's 25 largest savings
institutions, operates branches throughout the New York region,
Georgia and Florida, and has two mortgage banking subsidiaries.
   Hamilton, an Atlanta holding company, is controlled by Ted
Arison, the principal owner of Carnival. Hamilton also owns all of
Ensign Financial Corp., which operates Ensign Bank. Ensign Bank has
branches in metropolitan New York and in Florida.
   Last month, Carnival lost in its attempt to take over Royal
Admiral Cruises Ltd. when Anders Wilhelmsen & Co., a Norwegian
partner in Royal Admiral, exercised its right to buy the 70 percent
of Carnival stock it did not already own.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate jumped to 6.4
percent in October from 5.9 percent in September, pushed up by
higher mortgage rates, the government said Friday.
   However, the gain was in line with forecasts by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson and by analysts. The financial markets,
relieved by the news, had little reaction.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has said fighting inflation,
which stood at 3.3 percent in January, is her No. 1 economic
priority.
   To curb prices, the government drove interest rates significantly
higher last summer, with the commercial banks' base lending rate
going from a 10-year low of 7.5 percent in June to the current 12
percent, and mortgage rates going up as well.
   The Department of Employment said its retail price index rose 1
percent in October from September after a 0.5 percent gain in
September from the previous month.
   The index, which uses a 1987 base of 100, stood at 109.5 in
October, compared with 108.4 in September, and 102.9 in October 1987.
   The department said the latest rise was mainly the result of
higher mortgage interest payments, following a round of
mortgage-rate hikes on Oct. 1 when the average rate of 11.5 percent
rose to 12.75 percent.
   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler said the index, excluding
mortgage interest payments, rose 5.1 percent in the year to October,
compared with an annual rate of 5.2 percent in September.
   ``Interest rates have had to be increased to constrain price
rises, but it will take time,'' Fowler said. ``The government will
continue to keep up the fight against inflation.''
   There were also price increases in clothing and footwear, motor
vehicles, motor vehicle insurance and beer, the government said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Gas PLC said Friday its earnings sank 69
percent in the first half of its fiscal year because of weaker oil
prices.
   British Gas said it earnings for the six months ended Oct. 2
totaled 22 million pounds, the equivalent of $39.8 million, compared
with 71 million pounds, in the same period a year ago.
   The company's earnings translate to 0.5 pence per share, compared
with 1.7 pence in the same period of 1987.
   The decline, although large, was not as bad as some analysts had
expected. British Gas stock fell 2 pence a share to 161.5 pence on
London's Stock Exchange.
   British Gas Chairman Sir Denis Rooke said the company typically
makes a small profit or suffers a loss during the first half of its
financial year, with the great majority of its income generated in
the second part of the year, which falls during winter.
   Revenue rose 5.6 percent to 2.64 billion pounds from 2.5 billion
pounds.
   The chairman said the first six months were ``strongly
influenced'' by external factors, such as declining oil prices and a
consequent loss in gas sales. Nonetheless, Rooke said, there was
underlying growth in the volume of gas sales to both the domestic
and commercial markets.
   British Gas did not break out quarterly results. It is not
required to under British law.

   The stock market headed higher today, encouraged
by hopes for a steadier dollar in foreign exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.49 to 2,054.94 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 594 up, 302 down and
492 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.80 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   On Thursday, central banks of the industrialized countries began
what appeared to be a concerted effort to intervene in foreign
exchange markets to support the slumping dollar.
   That campaign continued today, pushing the U.S. currency higher.
   But analysts said many traders were waiting skeptically to see
whether the dollar could manage a sustained period of recovery on
its own.
   They also said market participants still had many misgivings
about the outlook for interest rates. A Treasury auction of 30-year
bonds on Thursday met with a relatively cool response.
   RJR Nabisco rose 1[ to 83~. The company was expected to receive

<HEAD>Travelers Cuts MoneyTrac Financial Management System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. has scrapped its
MoneyTrac personal financial management system after fewer than two
years, saying it couldn't sign up enough subscribers to justify its
cost.
   MoneyTrac was a one-stop money management system offered by
companies to their workers as a benefit. For a $100 annual fee, the
system allowed workers to buy insurance, apply for mortgages,
contribute to savings accounts, and receive credit cards through
Travelers.
   The fee was sometimes paid by the company, sometimes by the
worker, and sometimes split between the two.
   Travelers spokesman Robert Obie refused Thursday to give any
details about how many individuals or companies had subscribed to
MoneyTrac, whether the product was profitable, or how much money
Travelers had spent in its development.
   ``That is proprietary marketing information and we are not able
to release it,'' Obie said.
   Loss of the business caused LSGE Advertising Inc. in Avon, which
handled advertising and public relations for MoneyTrac, to lay off
four of its 34 workers this week, said Gary Lessner, the firm's
chairman.
   Lessner said the account was worth about $2 million a year in
billings to his agency, which bills about $20 million annually.
   Obie said Travelers will continue to provide the service to
subscribers until their contracts expire.
   Travelers has discontinued and divested itself of a series of
products and subsidiaries has it works to restructure its flagging
business.

   The stock market showed a small gain today,
encouraged by hopes for a steadier dollar in foreign exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .72 to 2,053.17 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 4 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 598 up, 467
down and 599 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 36.41 million shares at
midmorning.
   On Thursday, central banks of the industrialized countries began
what appeared to be a concerted effort to intervene in foreign
exchange markets to support the slumping dollar.
   That intervention continued today, pushing the U.S. currency
higher.
   But analysts said many traders were waiting skeptically to see
whether the dollar could manage a sustained period of recovery on
its own.
   They also said market participants still had many misgivings
about the outlook for interest rates. A Treasury auction of 30-year
bonds on Thursday met with a relatively cool response.
   RJR Nabisco rose 1[ to 83~. The company was expected to receive
formal offers late today from competing groups seeking to acquire
its stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.25 to 149.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .10 at 285.47.

   Soybean futures opened mostly higher today on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a modest recovery from Thursday's steep
decline. Grain futures opened mostly lower.
   The soybean market gained strength from improved European
soybean-oil and soybean-meal markets and from the Agriculture
Department's report of a moderate increase in export sales of U.S.
soybeans for the wek ending Nov. 10, analysts said.
   Soybeans came under extreme pressure Thursday and closed at their
lowest levels since mid-May. Traders have been disappointed in the
slow pace of export sales, and analysts said soybean prices had to
move lower to encourage more foreign buying.
   Corn and wheat futures opened mostly lower today in thin trading.
   ``It's a pretty featureless affair'' in the grain pits, said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.09 a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.58 a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.03{ a bushel;
and soybeans were { cent lower to 7 cents higher with November at
$7.22 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December
at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent
lower with January at 82.65 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .40
cent lower with December at 40.50 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .07 cent to .15 cent lower with February at 43.50 cents
a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

<HEAD>EEC Reacts Coolly To Reagan Offer On Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community reacted
coolly Friday to President Reagan's offer to soften the U.S.
position on agriculture subsidies at next month's world trade talks
in Montreal.
   A spokeswoman for the EEC Commission said the offer ``was not a
fundamental change'' in the U.S. desire to eliminate all farm
subsidies.
   Reagan said Thursday the United States would be flexible about a
deadline for abolishing farm subsidies. Until now, it had demanded
such subsidies be stopped by the year 2000.
   The Commission spokeswoman said the EEC seeks a reduction in farm
subsidies over the long term, not their complete elimination.
   Reagan's speech was seen here as an attempt to ensure progress at
the Montreal talks due to begin Dec. 5.
   The meeting will assess progress made to date in the four-year
Uruguay round of trade liberalization talks within the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   That progress is to be discussed in weekend talks here between
the U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng and top EEC officials.
   On Friday, Yeutter and Lyng discussed other contentious trade
issues with their EEC counterparts, including EEC plans to ban
imports of hormone-treated meat from the United States as of Jan. 1
and U.S. objections to possible EEC subsidies for the Airbus
consortium.
   On Saturday the talks will focus on the Uruguay trade round of
the GATT talks. Yeutter is in Brussels after having meetings in
recent days in West Germany, France and the Netherlands.

<HEAD>Dean Witter Settles Case Charging Lost Millions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 30 investors who charged they lost
millions of dollars because of unauthorized high-risk investments by
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. have settled with the brokerage firm,
officials said Friday.
   The out-of-court settlement late last week came shortly after the
resignation by the manager of Dean Witter's Boston office, who along
with a broker and the firm was the target of a lawsuit by a group of
39 investors.
   Complaints against two other firms, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
and Merrill Lynch & Co., are pending, said Samuel Shafner, an
attorney for the plaintiffs.
   The investors had filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court here in
July against Anoop K. Barman, a broker allegedly responsible for the
bulk of the transactions, and against Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch,
where he worked from 1985 to 1987.
   Barman also worked for Shearson, and that firm is in settlemenmt
negotiations although it has not been sued, Shafner said.
   Terms of the settlement with Dean Witter were not disclosed. An
attorney for Dean Witter confirmed only that a settlement had been
reached.
   Shafner said two of the Dean Witter customers refused to settle
and that their cases likely would be decided by a securities
industry arbitration panel and not in court. Several other customers
still are negotiating with the brokerage giant.
   ``We're very, very pleased with all the settlement amounts with
those who settled and the aggregate,'' Shafner said.
   Despite the settlement, the state Securities Division is still
investigating whether Dean Witter violated the Massachusetts
Securities Act, said Paul Glickman, the division's chief of
enforcement.
   ``This will not change our investigation,'' he said. ``We expect
to continue.''
   Glickman confirmed that the probe focuses on whether the firm
entered into trades above the investors' financial capabilities and
mishandled millions of dollars and whether supervision was adequate.
The investigation began after several investors complained to the
state.
   The securities act contains regulations governing investments by
brokers in stock options that are beyond a customer's means. The
probe involves Dean Witter's Boston and Burlington offices and at
least five executives, including Boston manager Stephen J. Lozen,
who resigned last week.
   Lozen has refused comment on whether his departure was tied to
the charges.
   Dean Witter spokeswoman Beth Metzler said Lozen resigned for
personal reasons not related to the charges. ``It was a voluntary
decision on Steve's part to resign from Dean Witter,'' she said.
   Not all of the 39 investors are involved in the cases against
Shearson and Merrill Lynch. Shafner said settlement negotiations are
underway with Shearson while Merrill Lynch has been served with a
lawsuit in federal court.
   In the suit, Barman is accused of violating state and federal
securities laws, fraud, deception and mishandling accounts to try to
generate larger profits and commissions in risky index options
trading.
   Options are agreements that allow investors to buy or sell shares
of stock within a stipulated time for a certain price. Barman
allegedly traded in index options, which are based on a package of
shares that make up one of the major market indexes, after clients
specifically barred him from doing so.

   Corn and soybean futures closed modestly lower
while most wheat futures advanced slightly in subdued trading Friday

prices drifted lower, analysts said. The contract for November
delivery of soybeans expired at noon CST at $7.27} a bushel, 8\
cents above Thursday's final price.
   Wheat gained on light support from commercial buyers. Speculative

<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers huddled Friday to break
an impasse between Iran and Iraq that threatens to scuttle the
cartel's efforts to raise crude prices.
   Oil officials from the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries shuttled among three hotels in the Austrian
capital in search of a solution.
   The oil ministers are trying to fashion a new production
agreement that would limit output and push up prices, which are
running $4 or more below the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   Analysts have been skeptical about chances that the ministers
would be able to come up with a strong agreement, however.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh met for about 90
minutes with officials from Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.
   ``I don't have anything new for you,'' he told reporters after
the meeting in the plush Marriott Hotel.
   ``It's too early to say something. ... I hope we reach a
solution,'' he said.
   Iraq's oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, arrived at the
hotel a few hours later for lengthy talks with the other ministers.
   ``Our position has not changed,'' he said before the discussions.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto, the former Indonesian oil
minister, said the meetings were ``taking place in a good
atmosphere.''
   ``We are hearing several approaches that we are trying out,'' he
said. ``There are many approaches to the problem and we should not
totally follow one track.''
   He refused to offer any details.
   He acknowledged the task was difficult.
   ``We are realistic enough to understand that these problems we
are facing are not easy ones,'' he said.
   At issue is Iraq's insistence on being allowed, under an OPEC
agreement, to produce the same amount of oil as rival Iran. Iran has
refused such parity.
   The cartel sets quotas or ceilings on the amount of oil its 13
members can produce.
   The ministers are trying to arrange a new accord _ the current
one dates to 1986 _ that would limit the recent surge in production
that has added to the already glutted market.
   Iraq refused to join the current arrangement because of its
demand for parity with Iran.
   Since the two countries agreed to a cease-fire in August in their
8-year-old war, efforts have been stepped up to try to bring Iraq
back into the OPEC quota system.
   Aghazadeh said he was still pressing for ``export parity'' with
Iran. That refers to his proposal that the rivals be given the same
quota for overseas sales.
   But Iran wants a higher overall ceiling to account for its
greater domestic demand estimated at some 1 million barrels a day.
Iraqi internal demand is put at about 300,000 barrels a day.
   Analysts estimate that Iraq has been producing at least 2.6
million barrels a day. The sum could soar to 3.7 million barrels
next year with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to
the Red Sea. Its quota under the 1986 accord was 1.5 million barrels.
   Iran also is believed to have exceeded its quota of 2.4 million
barrels.
   The current production agreement sets total production at 15
million barrels a day, excluding Iraq.
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that the cartel's production jumped to almost 21.1
million barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output in more
than five years.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has boosted its
output to more than 6 million barrels a day, analysts estimate, well
above its daily quota of 4.3 million barrels.
   The behind-the-scenes talks were held throughout the day. They
followed a brief meeting Thursday night of officials from eight OPEC
countries, who are members of two cartel committees.
   The formal committee discussions were to resume Saturday
afternoon.
   On Monday, all 13 oil ministers will gather for their winter
meeting.
   OPEC members include Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia,
Venezuela, Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.
   Others are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates.

<HEAD>Coke Rolls Out Microwave-Size Drink Machines For Small Office
Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co., taking aim at a million offices
too small for a conventional Coke machine, has introduced an
alternative about the size of a microwave oven.
   Dubbed the ``BreakMate,'' the machine dispenses three different
soft drinks into cups in a programmed portion size. An on-board
carbon dioxide tank turns tap water into carbonated water, then the
machine mixes carbonated water with drink syrup, chilled by a small
refrigeration unit.
   The whole machine measures 22 by 11 by 18 inches and weighs 78
pounds. And if the boss is too cheap to spring for the Cokes, a
coin-operated version is available.
   Coke estimates that 1 million U.S. offices of 50 workers or less
don't have soft drinks on the premises, and the company hopes to
eventually sell an extra 20 million gallons of syrup each year _ or
about 2.4 billion drinks _ in the markets it cannot now reach.
   ``The objective is to put BreakMate wherever Coca-Cola is not
readily available to consumers,'' Coca-Cola USA President Ira
Herbert said in a statement this week.
   The company estimates that 20,000 units will be in place by the
end of the year, with more than 40,000 more installed in the United
States next year. Distributors are currently on line in 25 U.S.
markets.

<TEXT>
   More than a week after Election Day, bond
investors have yet to give President-elect George Bush their vote of
confidence even though many had longed for a Republican victory.
   One reason is clear: There's just too much uncertainty over how
Bush and a Democratic-controlled Congress will tackle sticky
economic problems such as the trade and budget deficits.
   Those questions have hurt the dollar in foreign exchange, and
that has had a domino effect on most bond prices and interest rates.
Widespread buying of dollars by central banks around the world broke
the currency's fall this past week, but the general sentiment
remains bearish.
   ``The erosion of the dollar has sent some flow of capital out of
our bond markets,'' noted William V. Sullivan, an economist for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Since Election Day, bond prices have declined steadily, with
prices of some long-term Treasury issues off nearly $20 per $1,000
face amount by Friday and yields rising over 9 percent for the first
time in more than a month.
   The price decline was carried to other markets, including those
where corporate and municipal bonds are sold.
   But the municipal market got some good news from Election Day.
Traders said they were heartened by the fact that voters nationwide
approved a record $13.8 billion in state and local bond issues that
were on the ballots to finance projects ranging from road and bridge
repairs to new prison facilities.
   Voters in a few other states also turned down severe anti-tax
measures that would have crimped the states' financial flexibility,
thereby hurting the credit ratings of bonds in those states.
   Neal Atterman said positive results on both fronts indicate a
greater support for the municipal market as a whole.
   General concerns about the economy weigh most heavily on the
secondary market for Treasury issues.
   ``Even though the worldwide financial community had looked for
the continuity of another Republican president, there hasn't been a
great deal of enthusiasm,'' said Sullivan. ``There's this deepening
concern, specifically among foreigners, about what will go on
between Bush and the House and Senate'' concerning the deficits.
   Investors worry that left unchecked, gaps in the federal budget
and balance of trade could ultimately damage the economy, and for
foreigners that makes the dollar less attractive.
   A weaker dollar poses a threat of higher inflation, which erodes
the value of dollar-denominated securities. In addition to higher
prices for imported goods, a weak dollar can drive up domestic
prices as foreign demand for U.S. goods increases, observed Robert
A. Brusca, chief financial economist with Nikko Securities Co.
International.
   Brusca and many other economists agree that the Federal Reserve
won't just sit back and watch all this happen, opting instead to
push up interest rates to support the dollar and keep inflation in
check. That would further depress prices of lower-yielding bonds in
circulation.

<HEAD>Canandaigua Wine to Lay Off 20 Percent of Work Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canandaigua Wine Co. will lay off 20
percent of its workforce and close a bottling operation in Virginia
in an effort to end two years of falling sales and profits, company
officials said Friday.
   The company currently employs about 650 workers at three wineries
in New York, three in California, one in Patrick, S.C., and the
Petersburg, Va., facility, which will be closed by January, said
company spokesman Staford Krause.
   About 40 workers will lose their jobs when the bottling
operation, called Richards Wine Cellars, closes, Krause said. The
remaining 90 employees scheduled to be laid off have been notified
of the cutbacks.
   ``In effect the cutback has started and is pretty much
completed,'' Krause said. ``This is not going to be a staggering,
drawn-out thing.''
   He said the cuts involved all levels of the company including its
force of sales representatives around the country.
   Canandaigua Wine, the fourth largest winery in the country, has
suffered millions of dollars of losses because of slumping sales of
Sun Country Wine Cooler, the product that catapulted the company
into prosperity not too long ago.
   Sun Country's demise has been swift.
   In November 1985, fueled by skyrocketing sales of Sun Country,
Canandaigua reported record earnings of $9.5 million for the fiscal
year ended Aug. 31, 1985 and the company's stock soared to over $50
a share.
   Two years later, troubled by huge advertising expenditures and
falling Sun Country sales, the company reported a loss of $9.7
million for fiscal year 1987. The company reported a loss of $4.8
million for fiscal 1988.
   On the American Stock Exchange, Canandaigua Wine stock fell 12{
cents a share to $8.25 on Friday.
   ``We deeply regret the necessity of reducing our work force,''
said Chairman Marvin Sands. ``We are hopeful, however, that such
actions will help us keep costs in line ... and maintain the company
as a strong and vigorous competitor nationwide.''

   Central bankers rescued the dollar again Friday,
buying large amounts of the currency and at least temporarily
bolstering or stabilizing its value in the foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices weakened. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$416.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $419.75 at the same
time Thursday.
   The central-bank dollar buying marked the second straight day of
massive coordinated currency intervention by the United States and
its key trading partners. Traders said the dollar's weakness
reflected growing concern about the long-term implications of the
large U.S. trade and budget deficits.
   ``The dollar should be going down and the markets want it down,''
said Scott Greene, a currency trader in New York with Switzerland's
Bank Julius Baer & Co.
   ``It used to be America was the haven for security. When there
was a flight of capital it always would go into dollars. That
confidence is gone,'' Greene said. ``If the central banks weren't in
there, who knows how low the dollar would be now.''
   Others said the aggressive level of central-bank dollar buying
was only intended to stabilize the currency or ease its rapid fall
since the Nov. 8 election of George Bush to succeed President Reagan.
   Until and unless the Bush administration can create genuine
interest in the dollar as an attractive currency, money traders
said, it was highly likely the central banks would have to maintain
a strong presence in the market to keep the dollar from dropping
precipitously.
   In Tokyo the dollar rose 0.88 yen to close at 122.40 yen. Later
in London the dollar strengthened further to 122.65 yen. By 4 p.m.
New York time the dollar fetched 122.60 yen, up from 122.16 yen at
the same time Thursday.
   The dollar gained on the British pound in London, where it cost
$1.8160 to buy a pound vs. $1.8227 late Thursday. The dollar also
strengthened against the pound in New York, where sterling fetched
$1.8155 vs. $1.8287 late Thursday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. rates late Thursday
included: 1.7370 West German marks, up from 1.7230; 1.4600 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4470; 1.2300 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2307;
5.9365 French francs, up from 5.8915; and 1,292.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,283.75.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe vs. late rates Thursday
included: 1.7360 marks, up from 1.7298; 1.4585 Swiss francs, up from
1.4518; 5.9340 French francs, up from 5.9075; 1.9610 Dutch guilders,
up from 1.9560; 1,293.75 Italian lire, up from 1,291.75; and 1.2343
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2335.
   Gold's retreat evidently stemmed from internal market pressures
rather than any outside news, dealers said.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
fell $2.70 a troy ounce to $417.40. In London gold fell $4.25 an
ounce to $417.75; in Zurich it fell $3.20 an ounce to $417.80 and in
Hong Kong it fell $3.11 to $421.23.
   Silver dropped 10.7 cents a troy ounce to $6.08 on the New York
Comex. In London silver dropped 20 cents to $6.09.

<HEAD>Company's Lack of Funds Halts Securities Orders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Oberweis Securities Inc., a
Midwest discount brokerage firm, said Friday they hoped to have
enough capital to resume customer orders by next week.
   The brokerage firm, headquartered in this Chicago suburb, said
Thursday it had temporarily stopped accepting orders for securities,
although it continued to sell stock, carry out options and conduct
non-purchasing business for existing accounts.
   ``We can confirm for you the firm has ceased doing business,''
said Craig Dearborn, director of the National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc.'s Chicago office.
   Clark Galloway, manager of the company's Rockford branch, said
Oberweis needed an additional $600,000 and expected the money by
Monday at the latest.
   ``It's a one-day, two-day problem at the most,'' he said.
``Oberweis is solvent.''
   Under NASD rules, brokerages must keep reserves up to a certain
level to continue doing business. Galloway said he did not know the
dollar amount of the reserve requirement.
   Galloway said the capital problem was caused partly by the stock
market crash last year and partly because of a recent acquisition.
   Some securities acquired in the purchase of a Minnesota brokerage
have declined in the last week, pushing capital reserves to below
acceptable levels, he said.
   Barry Weber, a spokesman for the majority stockholder in
Oberweis, told the Chicago Tribune that company capital fell below
NASD requirements in part because misconduct by a former broker in a
Minneapolis office caused the firm hundreds of thousands of dollars
in losses.
   Weber is vice chairman to Ronald Alghini, a wealthy Chicago
investor who heads Phoenix Capital Corp., and who purchased a
majority stake in Oberweis in August, the newspaper said.
   At the time, Alghini said Oberweis would undergo immediate
restructuring and predicted the company, which had suffered lean
balance sheets in recent years, would be highly profitable by
December of this year.
   Weber declined to identify the individual he said was involved in
the losing trades, but said the broker was fired Nov. 4 after it was
learned that he and possibly others had established large and
unauthorized positions in four over-the-counter stocks, the Tribune
reported.
   The unauthorized trading came to light after the market turned
against the four positions, forcing the firm to use its capital to
cover the losses, the newspaper said.
   The trading reportedly involved selling stock short, an
arrangement in which the investor sells borrowed stock, hoping its
price would fall, the Tribune said.
   Officials of the company said Thursday that customers' accounts
were safe.
   ``There should be no repercussions,'' said Joe Warnelis, an
Oberweis investment executive. ``We are not shut down, but we have
voluntarily restricted the level by which we do business. We have
taken steps to bring in additional capital.''
   All accounts at Oberweis are insured up to $500,000 by the
Security Investors Protection Corp., which is similar to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. for banks, said Michael Don, deputy general
counsel for the protection corporation in Washington.
   The protection corporation, which charges securities dealers $100
each to fund the insurance pool, will reimburse investors up to
$100,000 for cash accounts at a brokerage that goes bankrupt. A
total of $500,000 can be reimbursed for cash and securities.

<HEAD>Silver Futures Slide To 20-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices slid to a 20-month low on New York's
Commodity Exchange Friday, the fourth straight day of steep losses,
and analysts said the metal appeared to be headed below $6 a troy
ounce.
   ``It certainly looks like it's going to try,'' said Stephen W.
Platt, metal-markets analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   On other markets, other precious metals also retreated while
copper futures gained; livestock and meat were lower; grains and
soybeans were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Silver for delivery in December tumbled nearly 36 cents a troy
ounce in the four sessions ended Friday. Prices settled 11 cents to
14.1 cents lower on Friday alone with the December contract at $6.08
a troy ounce, the lowest Comex silver price since March 27, 1987.
   Metals experts cited a variety of factors for silver's sudden
decline but all agreed that supplies of the metal were more than
adequate and that the recent sharp rise in short-term interest rates
has had a depressing effect on demand from both the industrial and
the investment sectors.
   The dollar's weakness since the Nov. 8 presidential election
would ordinarily help prop up the precious metals because of its
inflationary implications.
   But ``the dollar going down hasn't been enough to offset the
negative influence of the interest rates going up,'' said Craig
Sloane, metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York.
   Sloane said the silver market actually had been weakening
relative to gold for the last two months, even though both metals
had been trending higher since the start of October.
   But the general decline in the precious metals during the past
week ``kind of took away the camouflage,'' he said.
   ``Gold and silver have a little reversal in place and I wouldn't
be surprised to see it follow through,'' Sloane said. ``I can see
gold possibly testing the lows (below $400 an ounce) that it made in
September and silver maybe breaking $6 and heading to $5.75.''
   Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, said much of Friday's silver decline
was due to dealer selling of the physical metal on speculation that
a month-old miners' strike in Peru was nearing its end and
availabilty of silver soon would increase.
   Gold settled $2.70 to $3.80 lower with December at $418.10 a troy
ounce.
   Copper futures advanced on the Commodities Exchange on continuing
concerns about supply disruptions in Chile and Peru, analysts said.
   Copper settled .50 cent to 2.60 cents higher with December at
$1.359 a pound.
   Hog futures prices dropped sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as the futures market adjusted to unexpected weakness in
the pork-products market, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Cattle futures retreated ahead of the Agriculture Department's
monthly tally of cattle being fattened for slaughter on feedlots in
the seven largest cattle-producing states.
   The report showed a 5 percent decline since last year in the
number of cattle on feed as of Nov. 1, the number placed on feedlots
in October and the number marketed off of feedlots last month.
   All the numbers were slightly above market expectations were
neutral to slightly bearish for futures prices, Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled .32 cent to .55 cent lower with December at
72.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .80 cent lower
with January at 81.97 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.17 cent lower
to .08 cent higher with December at 40.15 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .50 cent to .65 cent lower with February at 43.07
cents a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures ended modestly lower while most wheat
futures advanced slightly in subdued trading on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Wheat gained on light support from commercial players. After the
close, the Agriculture Department announced sales of 110,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat to Iraq at subsidized prices.
   The November soybean contract expired at noon CST at $7.27} a
bushel, 8\ cents above Thursday's final price.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1} cents higher with December at
$4.11 a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents lower with December at
$2.58\ a bushel; oats were { cent to 3{ cents lower with December at
$2.00{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6\ cents lower with
January at $7.31 a bushel.
   Oil futures prices ended mixed in choppy trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as OPEC members continued to meet informally in
Vienna to discuss the longstanding problem of overproduction.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 31 cents
higher with December at $13.60 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to
.26 cent lower with December at 42.76 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was unchanged to .36 cent lower with December at 45.65 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 1.15 points higher at 265.80.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department, in another
reversal, announced Friday that United Airlines would retain the
rights to fly the lucrative Seattle-Tokyo air route.
   The decision was the latest twist in the two-year battle over the
$100 million route that has involved United, Continental and
American airlines.
   ``This is our final decision,'' said Hal Paris, a Transportation
Department spokesman, adding that the White House already has
approved the selection of United.
   The department, in making its decision, found that the
Chicago-based United would ``offer more convenient service and would
carry more passengers than would Continental or American.''
   In addition, the department found that United's extensive
connecting service from Tokyo to other Far Eastern cities gave it a
``substantial edge'' over the other two airlines seeking the route.
   ``In large part because of these advantages, United would be
better able to compete with the other carriers now providing nonstop
Seattle-Japan service,'' the department said in a statement released
with the 15-page decision.
   Both Northwest Airlines and Japan Air Lines also fly nonstop
between Seattle and Tokyo.
   While airline deregulation gave air carriers the freedom to fly
wherever they want within the United States, entry into overseas
routes is still subject to government approval and limited by
treaties with the other countries involved.
   At various times over the past two years, administrative law
judges and top department officials have awarded the route to
United, Continental and American.
   Most recently, the Transportation Department said in late
September that it would comply with a U.S. Appeals Court decision
awarding the route to Continental.
   But a month later, the department anounced that it was
reconsidering that decision.
   Besides United and American, all 10 members of the Washington
state congressional delegation had urged the department to
reconsider with most of the lawmakers urging that United retain the
route.
   United assumed the route in 1986 when it purchased Pan American
World Airways' Pacific Division, but the department approved the
purchase only on the condition that the Seattle-Tokyo route be dealt
with in a separate proceeding.
   United had warned that it might drop its Seattle-Hong Kong route
and lay off many of its 2,000 employees at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport if it didn't retain the Seattle-Tokyo route. A
$20 million expansion of United facilities at Seattle-Tacoma was put
on hold pending a decision.
   American officials had said their airline was prepared to build a
new $100 million to $150 million hub at Seattle-Tacoma if it
received the route.
   American officials also said United wanted to retain the route
just to block other airlines from gaining a foothold in the Far
Eastern market. United already flies between Los Angeles and Tokyo
and San Francisco and Tokyo.
   Continental officials had said their airline was prepared to
slash fares to the Far East if it received the route, including
one-way Seattle-Tokyo fares as low as $299.

<HEAD>Pepperell Files Additional Suit To Stall Farley Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. filed suit against
Farley Inc. Friday, charging that Farley's chairman made
contradictory statements about whether he planned to break up the
textile giant if Farley's takeover bid is successful.
   Pepperell seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary
injunction against Farley's offer for the company. The offer is
currently scheduled to expire Monday.
   Farley, a Chicago-based manufacturer of precision metal products
and clothing, announced a tender offer for stock in Pepperell, a
West Point, Ga.-based textile company, on May 23. Farley currently
owns 2.87 million shares, or 9.8 percent, of Pepperell stock.
   The suit alleges that while Chairman William Farley has stated
publicly he has no plans to break up Pepperell, filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that Farley plans to
keep Pepperell's household fabrics business and sell the apparel,
apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics divisions to create funds to
repay acquisition costs.
   In the suit, Pepperell asks that Farley be ordered to clarify its
intentions toward Pepperell.
   Pepperell also had filed an emergency appeal Wednesday with the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in an attempt to halt Farley's
takeover attempt. No ruling had been made on that appeal by Friday.

   The stock market struggled to a modest gain in
light trading Friday, encouraged by hopes for a steadier dollar in
foreign exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.96 to 2,062.41,
trimming its loss for the week to 4.62 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
841 up, 552 down and 551 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 119.32 million
shares, down from 141.28 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 141.91 million shares.
   On Thursday, central banks of the industrialized countries began
what appeared to be a concerted effort to intervene in foreign
exchange markets to support the slumping dollar.
   That intervention continued Friday, pushing the U.S. currency
higher.
   But analysts said many traders were waiting skeptically to see
whether the dollar could manage a sustained period of recovery on
its own.
   They also said market participants still had many misgivings
about the outlook for interest rates. A Treasury auction of 30-year
bonds on Thursday met with a relatively cool response.
   RJR Nabisco rose 1\ to 84 and led the active list on turnover of
more than 4.2 million shares. The company was expected to receive
formal offers by late Friday from competing groups seeking to
acquire its stock.
   General Electric, which raised its quarterly dividend from 35
cents a share to 41 cents a share, climbed { to 43~.
   Hewlett-Packard rose 1} to 48[. On Thursday the company reported
that its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31
increased to $1.03 a share from 85 cents a share in the like period
a year earlier.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up | at 42[;
American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 27|; International Business
Machines, up \ at 115}, and Coca-Cola, up { at 42.
   Veeco Instruments added | to 25] on top of a 1~-point gain
Thursday, when the company agreed to be acquired by Unitech PLC for
$26.50 a share.
   Japanese stocks declined amid what brokers described as
``profit-taking'' after the Tokyo market's recent move to record
highs. Matsushita Electric dropped 1\ to 193}; Honda Motor 3 to
154}, and Kyocera { to 78}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $13.76 billion, or 0.53
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.94 to 150.18.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.43 to 306.36, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.87 at 266.47.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .15 to 367.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 286.67, up 1.30.

<HEAD>Three Unions At Eastern Seek To Block Sale of Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three unions at Eastern Airlines on Friday
formally asked for a preliminary injunction to block the $365
million sale of its Northeast shuttle service to real estate magnate
Donald Trump.
   The motion filed in U.S. District Court in Washington by the
International Association of Machinists, the Air Line Pilots
Association and Local 553 of the Transport Workers Union had been
anticipated for a month.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in October had scheduled a
hearing on it for Dec. 2, giving Eastern until Nov. 25 to file a
response.
   The three unions contended in the motion that the sale of the
Boston-New York-Washington shuttle violates the Railway Labor Act as
part of an attempt by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., to break
the unions in the midst of collective bargaining on new contracts.
   ``The sale is yet another attempt by (Texas Air Chairman) Frank
Lorenzo to dismantle Eastern Airlines,'' said Jack Bavis, head of
the pilots union at the carrier. ``They've done nothing but squeeze
out assets over the last two years. The shuttle is one of the
strongest links in Eastern's structure.''
   Although the shuttle has been consistently profitable, Texas Air
contends the sale is necessary to raise cash for preserving the rest
of Eastern, which has lost more than $300 million since 1986.
   The shuttle deal is scheduled for completion on Dec. 15.

   Oil futures prices turned mixed as OPEC ministers
prepared to hold formal meetings to discuss curbing overproduction.
   But market watchers said they weren't optimistic that the
gathering to be held Monday in Vienna would help eliminate the
worldwide oil glut and boost sagging prices.
   ``There's a growing sentiment that OPEC is having a difficult
time getting their act together,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy
analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose
31 cents to settle Friday at $13.60 a barrel, after losing 38 cents
on Thursday. Other contract months also gained ground.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Friday,
the December contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 45.65 cents a
gallon, unchanged from Thursday. The contract fell 0.85 cent on
Thursday.
   The December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which fell
1.50 cents in the previous session, lost 0.21 cent to settle at
42.76 cents a gallon.
   Informal OPEC talks in Vienna hit a snag on Friday, with some
ministers working to break an impasse between Iran and Iraq.
   At issue is Iraq's insistence on being allowed to produce the
same amount of oil as rival Iran. Iran has steadfastly refused such
parity.
   The Oranization of Petroleum Exporting Countries sets quotas or
ceilings on the amount of oil its 13 members can produce. The
ministers are trying to arrange a new accord _ the current one dates
to 1986 _ that would limit the recent surge in production that has
added to the already glutted market. All 13 ministers plan to meet
formally beginning Monday.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. aides were spending the weekend
scrutinizing at least two debt-financed takeover bids for the food
and tobacco behemoth, up for sale in what amounts to history's
biggest corporate auction.
   Contenders for the 19th largest U.S. company had until 5 p.m. EST
Friday to submit proposals to a special committee of RJR Nabisco
directors on how much they were willing to pay and how they intended
to raise the purchase money.
   RJR spokeswoman Polly Howe said the committee intended to remain
silent about the bidding process indefinitely. ``They are not
discussing or disclosing or confirming. There is no comment
regarding the proposals,'' she said.
   Sources familiar with process confirmed that the two main bidders
for the company submitted proposals by the deadline but details
about them weren't disclosed. It also remained unclear whether any
other bids were delivered.
   Wall Street speculators, who had battered the RJR stock down to
$82.75 a share earlier in the week after being spooked by rumors of
withdrawn bids, ran it back up to $84 in heavy trading Friday.
   ``People had gotten a little anxious,'' said Marc I. Cohen, a
securities analyst who follows RJR Nabisco for the investment firm
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York. ``It was overdone.''
   Though details of any winning offer were not expected to be
disclosed until Sunday afternoon at the earliest, most analysts
reckoned it would put at least a $91-a-share value on the company's
225.3 million shares, or about $20.5 billion.
   Before the Friday deadline, two known contenders were vying for
the company in a takeover battle that has dwarfed all previous
records in size and complexity.
   One is a group consisting of RJR Nabisco's top managers and the
investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers
Inc. The managers incited the battle by disclosing last month they
were considering buying up all outstanding RJR Nabisco shares with
borrowed money, the takeover tactic commonly known as a leveraged
buyout.
   The other bidding group is headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., undisputed leader in leveraged buyouts. The Kohlberg faction
also includes the powerful investment firms of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co., Wasserstein Perella & Co. and
Merrill Lynch & Co.
   In the early stages of the fight both groups offered more than
$20 billion for RJR Nabisco, the Atlanta-based maker of hundreds of
items that range from Jose Cuervo tequila to Salem cigarettes and
Life Savers candy to Milk Bone doggie snacks.
   Lawyers and investment advisers for RJR Nabisco's special
directors committee were expected to hole up in their New York
offices analyzing the bids at least through Sunday morning. The
five-member committee was then expected to consider which bid to
accept.

<HEAD>Central Banks Bolster Dollar for Second Day</HEAD>

   The slumping dollar has again been bolstered by
central banks buying the U.S. currency in foreign-exchange markets.
   For a second straight day, Friday's coordinated intervention
drove the dollar higher. That sparked a small gain on the stock
market, but deep-rooted bearish sentiment continued to envelop the
U.S. currency.
   ``The market hasn't really been frightened by the intervention,''
said David Redding, an international money-market economist at
Bankers Trust Co. ``The fundamental psychology (toward the dollar)
is still fairly negative.''
   The dollar purchases in the open market by the Federal Reserve,
the Bank of Japan and several major European central banks extended
a worldwide buying spree that appeared to be the heaviest since the
spring.
   On Wall Street, which had been unnerved by the dollar's slide,
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 9.96 points to
2,062.41, trimming its loss for the week to 4.62 points.
   Bond prices also gained, pushing interest rates lower. The yield
on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell to 9.11 percent
from 9.17 percent late Thursday.
   Investors in the financial markets worry that a weak dollar could
drive up interest rates and spark higher inflation, since it would
raise prices of imports and some domestic commodities.
   Currency traders reported that the central bank intervention
began with the Bank of Japan buying dollars in the Tokyo market,
where the U.S. currency had dropped on Thursday to a near 40-year
low of 121.50 Japanese yen.
   The Bank of Japan was later joined in European foreign-exchange
markets by the central banks of West Germany, Britain, Switzerland,
France, Italy, Austria and other nations, traders said. All the
participating central banks were reported to be buying dollars to
soak up the supply of the U.S. currency while selling yen and West
German marks.
   Dealers said the dollar was jolted early in the New York trading
day by remarks by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who told
NBC's ``Today Show'' he's not concerned with the currency market
gyrations. The comment sent the dollar down about a pfennig against
the mark, bringing the Fed back into the market with more sales of
the mark to buy dollars.
   Then Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson jawboned
the dollar higher by calling its recent steep decline a ``purely
speculative'' phenomenon that has been brought under control by the
concerted intervention.
   The dollar rose in Tokyo and strengthened further in London and
New York. The dollar was quoted at 122.60 yen in late New York
trading, up from 122.15 yen late Thursday.
   Against the mark, the dollar advanced to 1.7370 from 1.7230 marks
late Thursday. The British pound slipped against the dollar,
fetching $1.8155 compared with $1.8287 the day before.

<HEAD>Burger King Franchisees Oppose Spin-off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. franchisees voiced strong
opposition Friday to a plan by the Pillsbury Co. to spin off the
fast-food chain as part of a defensive restructuring aimed at
thwarting a hostile $5.23 billion takeover bid from Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   The National Business Planning Council, the official franchisee
group, said in a letter to Burger King Chairman Jerry Levin that the
spin-off would add too much debt to the slumping company, which is
based in Miami.
   ``We strongly oppose this proposed course of conduct,'' B.N.
Pothitous wrote on behalf of the council.
   Pothitous said the franchisee group ``cannot and will not''
support any restructuring that will restrict further investment and
competitive growth in the chain.
   Levin, who was at Pillsbury headquarters in Minneapolis Friday
afternoon, said the letter confirms conversations he had with the
franchisees throughout the week.
   ``They informed us they were quite concerned with the level of
debt in the models we showed them,'' Levin said. ``We will explain
those concerns and issues to our board of directors.''
   Levin would not say when the directors will meet again. He said
he presented only one restructuring model to the franchisees.
   He said franchisees ``made a lot of good points and we learned a
lot'' during the week of meetings.
   The franchisees also met this week with officials from Grand Met.
The British liquor, gambling and specialty products conglomerate has
said it would invest money in Burger King and streamline its
operations if the takeover bid is successful.
   The fast-food chain accounted for $1.91 billion of Pillsbury's
$6.19 billion sales in fiscal 1988. Operating profits for the year
were $48.2 million at Burger King while net earnings for Pillsbury
were $69 million, or 81 cents a share.
   Grand Met's $60 a share tender offer has been extended three
times. The offer was set to expire again at midnight Friday, but
could be extended Monday.
   Pillsbury's board of directors rejected the all-cash tender offer
as inadequate on Oct. 17 and later announced the plan to spin off
Burger King into a separate public company. Pillsbury shareholders
would receive stock in the new Burger King, which would issue a
special shareholder dividend _ the size of which has not been
disclosed.
   Grand Met and dissident shareholders are suing Pillsbury to
invalidate the company's ``poison pill'' takeover defense and to
block the spin off of Burger King. The pill would make a takeover
prohibitively expensive and a newly separate Burger King would
present a huge tax liability for Grand Met if a takeover is
successful, according to the lawsuits.
   Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith has refused offers to meet with
Grand Met officials to negotiate the tender offer. Smith has said
Pillsbury shareholders would be better off in the long run under the
restructuring being proposed by the board of directors.
   Pillsbury stock closed Friday at $57.25 a share in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Meanwhile, Pillsbury on Friday named C. Ronald Petty as president
and chief operating officer of Burger King.
   Levin said franchisees have ``an enormous amount of respect for
Ron's talents and a high degree of confidence that he will provide
strong leadership in the new position.''
   Petty, 44, has 15 years of experience in the fast food industry,
including stints with Burger King USA, Burger King International and
the real estate division of McDonald's Restaurants.
   Grand Met spokesman Walter Montgomery said the British company is
``pleased but not surprised'' by the franchisees' opposition to the
Burger King plan. He said Grand Met remains confident the tender
offer will prevail.
