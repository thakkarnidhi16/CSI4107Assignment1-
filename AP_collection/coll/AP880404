   At least seven people died in small-plane crashes in Colorado
and California, including three killed Sunday when a single-engine
plane smashed into the ground after taking off from the Colorado
Springs Municipal Airport.
   A fourth person aboard the Beechcraft Bonanza, an 18-year-old
man, suffered serious burns and was listed in ``very critical
condition'' at Saint Francis Hospital in Colorado Springs, nursing
supervisor Donna Skovgaard said. He was transferred later to a burn
unit at Penrose Hospital.
   Names of the victims were being withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   The plane had just taken off when it crashed and burned at about
3:45 p.m. in a sparsely populated area about one mile north of the
airport, said Sgt. Dean Kelsey of the El Paso County sheriff's
office.
   In Calpella, Calif., about 120 miles north of San Francisco, the
only occupant of a single-engine plane was killed Sunday when the
aircraft crashed. The victim was not immediately identified, said a
dispatcher for the Mendocino County sheriff's office who declined
to give his name.
   Sunday evening, at least one person died when a twin-engine
aircraft crashed and burned on a hillside in Orinda, 15 miles east
of San Francisco. A second person was believed to be aboard the the
plane, said dispatcher Angela Hutch, but she didn't know if that
person had survived or not.
   West of Boulder, Colo., authorities on Sunday found the bodies
of two people who died in the crash of a glider in the mountains
Saturday. The wreckage was also found some distance away,
authorities said. The two were identified as James Lesley Clayton,
30, of Boulder, the pilot; and Loren M. Swisher, 40, of Green
River, Wyo.
   The glider had been released over Twin Sisters Peak at 12:15
p.m. Saturday and was reported missing at about 3 p.m. when it
failed to return to Cloud Base, a Boulder aircraft school where
Clayton worked as an instructor.
   Searchers found the wreckage Sunday morning in steep,
snow-covered terrain east of the Green Mountain summit in the
Flatirons.

<HEAD>Total Water Use for Irrigation Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amount of water going for irrigation in
the United States has declined in recent years, mostly because
farmers have shifted millions of acres out of irrigation entirely,
says an Agriculture Department report.
   John Hostetler and Michale Moore of the department's Economic
Research Service said that until the 1980s ``the spread of
irrigation in the United States was as persistent as an incoming
tide.''
   But preliminary figures by the U.S. Geological Survey, which
collects nationwide water use data every five years, indicate that
about 137 billion gallons of water a day went for agricultural
irrigation in 1985, down nearly 6 percent from 145 billion a day in
1980.
   This was an ``unprecedented decline'' resulting from a 17
percent drop in the use of water pumped from underground sources,
or groundwater, they said. Agriculture's use of water drawn from
reservoirs, lakes, rivers and other surface sources increased
slightly from 1980 to 1985.
   Groundwater accounted for less than 34 percent of the water used
for irrigation in 1985, compared with 40 percent a decade earlier.
   Hostetler said the turnaround since 1980 partly reflects water
conservation efforts, participation in farm programs and declining
net income from irrigation.
   Although water conservation measures are important, the major
factor in the reduced water use is not that irrigators have
tightened up on their spigots, Hostetler said. Rather, it is the
shift of acreage out of irrigation.
   The U.S. irrigated crop area climbed for decades, rising to more
than 50 million acres in 1978. It edged down slightly in 1982
before dropping sharply to 44.7 million acres in 1984.
   Hostetler said that declines in irrigated acreage have been
reported in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and
Utah, states where irrigators depend heavily on groundwater
supplies and where water tables have been falling.
   The shift in acres from irrigation not only reflects the drop in
water tables and rising energy costs to pump the water, but the
relatively weak commodity prices of the 1980s.
   ``Roughly half the irrigation systems in the country are driven
by electric motors, and electricity prices are going up,''
Hostetler says in the April issue of Farmline magazine. ``In the
southern plains (Texas and Oklahoma), natural gas is the major
energy source, and gas prices have been rising since deregulation.''
   Thus, many farmers have cut water use drastically or have
shifted to dryland farming.
   All of the adjustments seem to be having an impact, he said. In
the Texas high plains, the water table reportedly rose more than
half a foot in 1986, the first increase in 36 years as
above-average rainfall helped replenish the aquifer.
   But other parts of the country have put more acres under
irrigation, at least through 1984. Until recently, Arkansas was
increasing its rice acreage, all of which is irrigated, and farmers
in the Southeast increased irrigation to handle the double cropping
of wheat and soybeans.
   ``These trends may have slowed in the last few years, but Delta
farmers are still shifting acres into corn, generally relying on
irrigation,'' the economists reported. ``And in the Corn Belt and
upper Midwest, supplemental irrigation probably continues to grow
as farmers augment rainfall to boost yields and protect themselves
against dry spells.''
   Government crop and land conservation programs ``will probably
pull some additional acres out of production'' and the pressures on
farmers in the plains to cut water use will continue, Hostetler
said.
   But higher commodity prices, when coupled with the
yield-boosting appeal of irrigation, could alter the economic
equation.
   ``A lot of people who dropped out of irrigated production in
recent years still have the equipment sitting around ready to
use,'' he said. ``If commodity prices were to strengthen
significantly, you'd probably see many of them starting up the
pumps again.''

   Many hog producers are proceeding slowly with
expansion plans, and a quick look at the traditional hog-corn ratio
helps explain why.
   The ratio expresses the number of bushels of corn equal in value
to 100 pounds of live hog. The Agriculture Department says that in
March the ratio dropped to 22.8, down from 25 in February and 32.2
in March 1987.
   The higher the ratio, the easier it is for hog producers to
recover their feed costs. There are many other factors affecting
decisions of pork producers, but feed costs still are important.
   The March ratio, which was included last week in USDA's monthly
report on farm prices, was based on preliminary figures which
showed the farm price of corn at $1.84 per bushel and the average
price of hogs at $41.90 per hundredweight.
   A year ago, corn was $1.47 per bushel and hogs $47.40 per
hundredweight.

   World inventories of cotton are expected to
decline 10 percent to about 29 million bales by the end of the
1987-88 crop season, according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   Despite the inventory decline, world cotton prices have dropped
since their peak last August and are now close to what they were a
year ago, the department's Economic Research Service said in the
April issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``The exceptionally large (1987) U.S. crop and continued upward
revision of foreign crop estimates are factors in the price
decline,'' the report said.
   U.S. cotton production is estimated at 14.7 million bales, up 51
percent from 1986. Foreign output is expected to total 64 million
bales, up 6 percent from the 1986-87 season.

<HEAD>Woman Who Lost Part of Face To Cancer Runs Support Network For

   The night Betsy Wilson first appeared in public
after losing part of her jaw to cancer in 1972, she was leaving a
tennis stadium when she caught a young boy staring at her twisted
and misshapen mouth.
   ``I just went baaah, like I was some sort of a monster. It made
me embarrassed and it made me laugh,'' said Mrs. Wilson. ``And it
made me deal with it.''
   The left side of her lower jaw had been removed because of an
unusual lip cancer that traveled along the nerves of her face.
Radiation killed the cancer and a bone bank provided her with a new
jaw. But it left her permanently disfigured.
   The 55-year-old Concord resident still gets stares. But she no
longer thinks of herself as monstrous-looking. Instead, she is
using what she learned from the deformity to organize and promote a
national mutual-help network she started last year called Let's
Face It.
   Mrs. Wilson, the mother of two sons and a daughter, says others
with facial deformities need to overcome their isolation and
negotiate a world that sees them as different and sometimes
frightening.
   ``Everyone reacts differently. That's the hard thing. You're
constantly surprised. You're not looking at yourself and you
forget. But you're constantly reminded,'' she said this weekend in
an interview from Berkeley, Calif., where she was visiting her
daughter and husband and making contacts.
   ``Mutual help is the thing. It's not complicated. It's
cost-effective,'' she said.
   Let's Face It, which is based in Concord, has 200 official
members in 30 cities and a mailing list of 2,000. But it is
estimated there are 450,000 new cases of facial disfigurement each
year in this country from auto accidents, burns, cancer and birth
defects, she said.
   Mrs. Wilson wants to help them help each other. But it takes
time, largely because of the reluctance of such individuals to
accept themselves.
   ``It took me years, and I mean years, to do my grieving over
losing my face,'' she said. ``But denial is also such protection.
It helps you survive.''
   Let's Face It provides such resources as lists of organizations
that help the facially disfigured, educational films and videotapes
and books.
   Family members need help, too. ``The patient is the pebble
dropped in the pond of the family,'' she said.
   In the wake of her illness, Mrs. Wilson and her husband, Jack,
separated. He moved to California, where he is dean of a law
school. They stay in touch. But she said that if Let's Face It
existed in the 1970s, they might still be together.
   ``We were traumatized. We didn't know how to talk about our
feelings and we're still learning. ... Our sexuality was invaded
and we didn't know how to deal with it except to be afraid.''
   The first Let's Face It was founded three years ago by a British
woman, Christine Piff. Her experiences losing her palate and left
eye to cancer were recounted in her book, ``Let's Face It.''
   Mrs. Wilson read the book then went to England to meet Ms. Piff
before starting the American branch of Let's Face It, which also
has members in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.
   ``We have a body and we have a spirit and I wasn't given much of
a choice, Mrs. Wilson said. ``I can't hide behind being an
attractive woman.''

   Although she plays a high-achieving high
school student on ABC's ``Growing Pains,'' Tracey Gold knows the
pain and frustration of failing grades in real life.
   Until last year, when she was a junior in high school, her
parents and teachers could not understand why Tracey consistently
scored poorly on tests despite hours of studying.
   ``We'd see her go on the set and take this script, and she'd
learn her lines faster than anyone,'' said Tracey's mother, Bonnie,
``and yet at school she'd study and study and nothing would come
out.''
   Finally, when she was 18, a psychologist diagnosed her as
suffering from a serious learning disability, attention deficit
disorder, according to this week's TV Guide.
   The disability makes absorbing and processing information
difficult. To help compensate, her parents and sister recorded her
lessons on cassettes, and Tracey listened to the tapes while
reading the lessons to herself. Last June, she graduated from a
college preparatory high school.

   Comedian Joan Rivers allowed two shows
go on despite sparse crowds, but says the experience kept her
``tempered.''
   By Wednesday, only 700 of 1,900 tickets had been purchased for
Rivers' Myrtle Beach show and 400 of 2,700 for her Charleston show.
Doug East, of East Entertainment Management, which had booked and
financed the dates, announced the shows were canceled.
   But Rivers stepped in, saying the only time she ever canceled a
show was after her husband died last August. She said she would
perform even if only one person was in the audience.
   ``It's OK, it keeps you tempered,'' Rivers said after Friday
night's Myrtle Beach show. ``You're just that much more grateful
next weekend when you go back to bigger houses. Every time the limo
pulls up it's nice to know they can take it away from you, too.''
   Rivers, who also performed to a small audience in Charleston on
Saturday, attributed the low ticket sales to the Good Friday and
Passover holidays.

   A court has temporarily placed teen-age pop
singer Tiffany Darwish in the custody of her aunt until a final
ruling is made in her bid to obtain legal adult status and control
of her career.
   For months, the 16-year-old entertainer known to fans as Tiffany
has been fighting a legal battle with her mother, Janie Williams,
who has had sole custody of her daughter since her 1985 divorce
from Tiffany's stepfather, Dan Williams.
   At stake is Tiffany's share of an estimated $3 million in
royalties from her MCA recordings, including her hit album,
``Tiffany,'' which has sold more than 4 million copies. As
Tiffany's sole legal guardian, Mrs. Williams is trustee of her
account.
   A juvenile court mediator was asked by Superior Court Judge
Richard Ibanez last week to make a recommendation in the case on
April 18.
   John Frankenheimer, a lawyer hired to represent Tiffany, said
the court had approved her aunt, Julie Abbas, as temporary guardian.

   Miss Taylor, who suffered broken ribs and a broken collarbone in
the February accident in Tennessee, was able to make a brief

   Hispanic voters may become pivotal players in
today's Colorado Democratic precinct caucuses, where Jesse Jackson
and Michael Dukakis are fighting for the winner's share of
Colorado's 45 national delegates at stake.
   On the Republican side, Pat Robertson supporters hope a flurry
of weekend campaigning by their candidate stops Vice President
George Bush's bid for a sweep of Colorado's 36 GOP delegates.
   Because Bush is almost certain to win the GOP nomination _ no
matter what Robertson does here _ the Democratic caucuses have
taken center stage.
   The four-tier process for choosing the delegates _ which
progresses through county, congressional district and state
conventions _ begins at 2,784 neighborhood meetings tonight.
   At those precinct meetings, which are expected to draw about
20,000 Democrats statewide, presidential preference polls will be
taken and roughly 10,000 delegates to the county conventions will
be selected on the basis of those polls. Delegates either will be
committed to one of the four Democratic candidates, or they will be
uncommitted.
   Dukakis has been endorsed by Gov. Roy Romer and state Democratic
chairman Buie Seawell, two of Colorado's six ``super delegates'' to
the national convention. Some political observers, like Seawell,
think the key to winning Democratic delegates may be found in the
Hispanic community.
   Hispanics make up about 12 percent of the registered voters
statewide, and under party rules, the Colorado delegation to the
Democratic National Convention in July will be at least 20 percent
Hispanic, officials said.
   ``Jesse Jackson is going after the Hispanic voter very
aggressively,'' said former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya, who
campaigned for Jackson here last week.
   But Dukakis, who speaks fluent Spanish, has done well among
Hispanics in contests so far. Dukakis campaign officials, however,
say the Massachusetts governor did not target Hispanics here.
   ``We are carrying out the same level of campaigning that we are
elsewhere,'' said Richard Ybarra, Dukakis' western states director
and a son-in-law of farmworker activist Caesar Chavez.
   Jackson organizers were counting heavily on his Easter weekend
appearances to draw supporters to the caucuses.
   ``Black churches have been a primary source of support for us,
and we are targeting those churches,'' said the Rev. J. Langston
Boyd, Jackson's Colorado coordinator.
   Dukakis visited a shelter for the homeless in Denver on
Saturday, saying he is ``a doer ... not just a talker.''
   Bob Johnson, one of five paid Dukakis staffers in Colorado,
predicted that Democrats would begin to focus on one Democrat to
beat Bush _ and that Democrat will be Dukakis.
   Gore has not been in Colorado recently, but his staff has been
busy trying to drum up support. Mike Veit, Gore's Colorado
director, said the strategy has been to seek support outside
metropolitan Denver.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has not campaigned in Colorado, is
not expected to be a factor tonight.
   At the Republican caucuses, Bush supporters hoped to prevent an
ambush by Robertson and his ``invisible army.''
   Republicans will take non-binding straw polls at some caucuses
tonight, but they are not required to do so.
   Delegates also will be selected for county conventions later
this month, but they will not be committed to any candidate.
   ``Turnout (at the caucuses) is expected to be a problem,'' said
Tom Hockaday, Bush's western regional coordinator. ``Bush will win
a majority at the caucuses, but we don't know by how much.
Robertson is still a player.''
   Robertson campaign aides set up 10 telephone banks to try to
persuade at least 10,000 people to show up for tonight's caucuses.
   David Nelson, a Denver businessman who is coordinating
Robertson's Colorado campaign, said his goal was to win one-third
to one-half of Colorado's 36 GOP delegates for Robertson.

   Lowell Anderson doesn't know what to do
with his first vacation in nearly 30 years, but a check for more
than $150,000 for all the time off he missed should broaden his
choices.
   ``It was like winning the lottery,'' said Anderson, the general
manager of Carrollton Municipal Utilities. ``But I pretty much knew
it was there. I figured I'd retire a little early.''
   Anderson, 60, earns about $56,000 a year running the utilities
in this a town of 4,700 residents 70 miles northeast of Kansas
City. He said he took his last vacation after he moved into the
general manager's job in 1959.
   After his promotion, the City Council allowed him to carry his
vacation time forward if he chose.
   ``Things just got busy, and I didn't figure I could take any
time off away from the job,'' he said. ``But they're going to make
me take some time this year. I still don't know what I'll do with
it.''
   Mayor Jack Mathis said the city-owned utility didn't see
compensatory time off as a realistic option and issued a check for
$153,400, throwing in a few weeks' vacation.
   ``We didn't think we'd do very well without him for 2{ years,''
Mathis said.

   Since a pair of rabbits arrived 30
Easters ago, owners of the Happy Chick Farm north of Gulfport have
been forced into the fish-bait business by necessity.
   Evolved from a 4-H Club project outgrown by the children of
Marie and Howard Mays, the farm has produced thousands of bunnies
and billions of worms and crickets.
   ``But I'm not directly into Easter business,'' Howard Mays said
Friday. ``Everything I have is breeder stock. But we've had pet
shops calling all afternoon.''
   The rabbits live in cages suspended above worm beds. Gravity
fertilizes the earthworm habitat with bunny byproducts _ an
innovation sprung from necessity.
   ``The odor got bad, so we got into the worm business,'' Mrs.
Mays said.
   With the help of eight employees, the Mays market 2{ million
wigglers per week. After a worm harvest, the leftover bedding dirt
is sold to gardeners. Profits from the highly-prized potting soil
keep Mrs. Mays driving a new car.

   A one-time rivalry between residents
over whose chickens produced the hardest eggs has turned into a
homecoming for this eastern Tennessee community.
   Natives from as far away as California and Iowa visited Sunday
to tap colored Easter eggs together in a 165-year-old contest to
see whose withstands the blows best.
   The event, dubbed the Peters Hollow Egg Fight, began in 1823
when the folks of Rome Hollow claimed the shells of their eggs were
harder than those laid in Peters Hollow down the creek.
   The eggs are tapped small end to small end while the contestants
stand in a circle until only the hardest one is left.
   Some families keep carefully guarded secrets about the way their
eggs are boiled and colored and what they feed their chickens.
   Gebe Ritchie, who has been chief judge and master of ceremonies
for 27 years, said every shell-hardening trick in the book has been
tried.
   ``One year I disqualified someone who put his eggs in the
freezer for a year,'' he said.
   About 300 people showed up for this year's contest. The top four
finishers in the junior and adult competitions received trophies.

<HEAD>Tulsa Astrologer Studies Charts Of Major Presidential Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRETT J. BLACKLEDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lela Powell looks to the heavens for
guidance in choosing the ideal president. The answers, she says,
are all in the stars.
   The Tulsa astrologer is busy piecing together the birth charts
of the men who would be president, saying they provide clues to the
candidates' haracter and abilities.
   A quick look at the chart for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, a Scorpio, shows the Democrat is a hard worker,
well-organized, a man who takes charge, Mrs. Powell said.
   George Bush's chart suggests the vice president, a Gemini, has
strong leadership qualities and excellent potential for growth, she
said.
   Mrs. Powell has studied astrology since the 1950s, after having
her own birth chart read while living in San Francisco. Her
interest in astronomy also encouraged her to explore astrology, she
said.
   ``Astrology simply seeks to answer the more philosophical why to
things, instead of just the more scientific how of astronomy,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Powell says there is more to her analysis of the
presidential candidates than the popular generic astrological
forecast (which she calls ``just a little sun-sign psychology'') or
tabloids' outlandish psychic predictions (which she calls
``tacky'').
   She said she is carefully studying each of the major candidate's
astrological charts, using an understanding of astronomy and
mathematics in determining each man's leadership ability.
   ``The natal chart for a leader is really good because it shows
us what he's really like,'' she said.
   That chart, known as a birth chart, is drawn with the help of
the candidate's birth date, and time and place of birth, she said.
   Aquarian presidents have been among the most successful _
including Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald
Reagan. There are no Aquarians in the remaining field of candidates.
   ``They may not have been the smartest, but they were the most
popular,'' Mrs. Powell said of the Aquarian presidents.
   Jesse Jackson, a Libra, is sincere, a peacemaker and has great
ability to cause change, according to his astrological chart.
   Fellow Democrat Albert Gore Jr., an Aries, has one of the most
impressive charts of all the candidates, Mrs. Powell said. Not only
was he born under the sign regarded as representing independence
and leadership, but his birth chart suggests he has excellent
potential and works in a businesslike fashion, she said.
   However, Gore's chart indicates his political success could come
later in life because of a strong indication of future development
and growth, Mrs. Powell said. Gore only turned 40 this past week.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon is seen as the philosopher among the
Democrats, according to the chart for the Sagittarian. He tends to
concentrate on basic issues, perhaps domestic concerns more so than
foreign affairs, Mrs. Powell said.

   President Reagan turned his
attention to his own presidential library today after spending a
quiet Easter out of public view.
   Reagan, in the fourth day of a holiday vacation, was being
accompanied by his wife, Nancy, to the home of Gen. William Lyon in
Cota de Caza in Orange County for a reception and luncheon with
some 75 Reagan Library Foundation supporters.
   The Reagans did not venture from their 688-acre ranch on Sunday,
with the president taking care of routine paperwork and the first
couple going horseback riding under a brilliant sun.
   Planners of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library were forced
to abandon a site at Stanford University after widespread protests
on the Palo Alto campus, and they have encountered skepticism over
a proposal to build the facility on a 100-acre site near Simi
Valley.
   The site, donated by the real estate firm of Blakeley-Swartz,
impinges on a greenbelt area that is protected from large-scale
development by a decade-old, non-binding agreement among Simi
Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks.
   White House aides said that during his vacation stay in the
Santa Ynez Mountains, Reagan was being kept abreast of events in
troubled Panama and elsewhere around the world.
   White House aides also hoped to use this week away from
Washington to work on plans for Reagan's May 26-June 2 summit in
Moscow with Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Reagans arrived in California on Friday and will vacation
until Sunday, when they return to the White House.

   A prisoner got stuck in a second-floor window
while trying to escape from a police headquarters holding cell and
had to be rescued by firefighters, police said.
   Felipe Perez, 26, who was being held for investigation of auto
theft, got out of a cell at Parker Center about 6:50 a.m. Sunday,
went into a hallway, pulled apart part of the window frame and got
stuck as he tried to climb through, said Sgt. Marvin Morton.
   Jailers found him while making their rounds. Firefighters raised
a ladder to the window and extricated him; the rescue operation
took 20 minutes.
   Perez, who had been in jail for two days, was sent to a hospital
because he complained of back pains, Morton said.
   Police were investigating how he got out of the cell, which had
no obvious defect, Morton said.

   Charles Alphin was a tough black cop who
thought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s non-violent philosophy
was ``sissy'' when the civil rights leader was gunned down 20 years
ago today.
   But these days Alphin, now a police captain, devotes himself to
practicing King's creed of non-violence in one of the city's
roughest districts and teaching it in schools.
   ``It's nothing superhuman what I'm doing,'' Alphin said. ``It's
being sensitive to others, it's being considerate, it's being
understanding, it's looking at people like you're all God's
children.''
   Growing up in the black neighborhoods of St. Louis in the 1940s
and 1950s, Alphin dealt with trouble the only way he knew how. ``We
had to fight to survive,'' he said.
   ``I thought that non-violence was sissy,'' said Alphin, who
joined the police force in 1964 and later became a homicide
investigator. ``I thought that it wasn't the way to solve
problems.''
   Alphin has come so far from his days as a street fighter that
NBC has chosen him as the subject of a television movie about
King's legacy.
   ``I'm honored, delighted, overwhelmed,'' said Alphin, 47. ``But
it's not really important who the messenger is, the most important
thing is that the message will be heard.''
   The movie tentatively is for broadcast in early 1989.
   ``We wanted to do a piece to illustrate the teaching of Martin
Luther King and the philosophy he stood for and that even all these
years later the dream lives on,'' said Lucy Johnson, who is
co-producing the movie with Harry Belafonte for Lorimar Productions
in Los Angeles.
   Johnson said Alphin was chosen because he was personally
affected by King only after the civil rights leader's assassination
on April 4, 1968.
   Alphin said his experience with prejudice was minimal while he
was growing up because he lived in a nearly all-black neighborhood.
But, Alphin said, when he went into the armed forces, he saw
firsthand what King was protesting because prejudice was prevalent.
   But not until 1981 and a chance acquaintance with Bernard
LaFayette, a civil rights worker from the 1960s, did the officer
begin comprehending the power of non-violence.
   LaFayette invited Alphin to join him and others on a trip
through the South to gauge the progress of blacks since the freedom
rides of 1961.
   ``That was the most educational nine days of my life,'' Alphin
said. ``I guess that was the first time I really realized about
black folks' history, about what the struggle meant.''
   Upon his return, Alphin attended workshops at the Martin Luther
King Jr. Center For Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. Last year,
he taught his first class there. He also is president of a St.
Louis support group that presents workshops on non-violence and
sponsors trips to the center.
   In 1986 and 1987, Alphin commanded the Police Department's
homicide division. His beliefs were tested to the limit.
   ``I used to drive home and pray and ask God why he sent me down
here. I just didn't understand why I was a non-violent person in
the most violent area _ homicide, sex crimes and child abuse,''
Alphin recalled.
   Alphin let it be known that he would tolerate no violence from
his officers, said Sgt. Tom Godfrey, a homicide detective. He was
as compassionate toward suspects as he was toward victims, Godfrey
said.
   Alphin also has been successful convincing young people that
there are alternatives to violence. He is one of several adults in
a group founded last year to counsel University City High School
students suspended for fighting.
   ``Charles, in a group with those kids, is the best role model,''
said Principal Doris Randolph. ``He's a Bill Cosby type _ he knows
how to respond to them.''

   Spring rains have turned the
expansive mound that is Love Canal into a green playground for
worm-fat robins feeding at the site of the former chemical dump.
   ``It's peaceful here,'' said Nunzio LoVerdi, one of a few
residents fighting to remain in their neighborhood among the
boarded-up houses and yellow signs that warn of toxic contamination.
   LoVerdi and others are in danger of losing their homes. But it's
not directly because of the industrial chemicals that once made the
community synonomous with environmental disaster.
   Federal and local officials want to tear down the low-income
housing project where he lives because they say it will cost too
much to renovate.
   ``I feel double-crossed,'' said LoVerdi, who with other
residents hired an attorney for possible court action to block the
city's plan. ``They said we could stay here until there was proof
that we were in danger from the chemicals.''
   In the summer of 1978, people in the quiet residential community
began to complain of fumes and chemicals oozing from their
basements. The state Health Department investigated, declared an
emergency and moved families out of homes built on the dump.
   Families living in a 10-block area near the site were given the
option of a buyout and those in the nearby Lasalle housing project,
where LoVerdi lives, were given the option of moving to another
city project.
   LoVerdi stayed because he doubted a chemical peril after the
extensive containment efforts and because the park-like project was
a nice place to live. The Lasalle project's modern apartments with
spacious yards were unlike any other public housing in the
industrial city of 77,000.
   LoVerdi said officials promised residents they could stay until
the completion of a study on whether the neighborhood is habitable.
An estimated 175 other families are awaiting the results of the
study to decide whether they can return.
   LoVerdi, 54, and his wife are one of the 19 families that stayed
in the 304-unit project.
   The embattled few in the project and several dozen families who
live in nearby homes all know each another and stick together.
They've been to countless meetings with officials and know all
about dioxin and the other chemicals dumped by Hooker Chemical Co.
in the 1940s and '50s in the aborted waterway project that
neighborhood children used as a swimming hole.
   Generally, the remaining residents are older and stubborn about
not leaving their homes, said Anita Gabalski, who works at the
state Department of Environmental Conservation office in Love Canal.
   ``Many of them are hostile and bitter at this point,'' Gabalski
said. ``They raised their families here and want more than anything
to have the place restored to the way it was. They see the fight
over the Lasalle project as a threat to their future and
lifestyle.''
   She said residents are particularly resentful of
environmentalists who want to preserve Love Canal as a symbol of
the dangers of industrial pollution.
   ``We don't want to be anybody's cause,'' said Louise Louis, a
longtime resident. ``They (environmentalists) would be just as
happy if the whole area was torn down. But this is our home and
we've got to fight for it.''
   Michael Raymond, director of the Niagara Falls Housing
Authority, said the decision to tear down the project was not an
environmental decision but an economic one.
   Federal officials are unwilling to spend the $35,000 per unit,
or $8.7 million, to renovate the buildings, Raymond said. In the 10
years since the emergency declaration, there have been few repairs
to them and the weather and vandals have taken their toll.

<HEAD>Poll: Dukakis Holds Small Lead Over Jackson In Wisconsin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis held a
narrow lead over Jesse Jackson in the week leading up to Tuesday's
Wisconsin presidential primary, according to a newspaper poll.
   Dukakis held a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over Jackson among
voters who said they would vote for, or leaned toward, a Democratic
candidate if the primary had been held at the time of the poll, The
Milwaukee Journal reported in its Sunday editions.
   On the Republican side, the poll showed Vice President George
Bush would easily defeat his remaining primary challenger, former
television evangelist Pat Robertson but might have a difficult time
winning Wisconsin in the general election if Dukakis were the
Democratic nominee.
   Bush held an 80 percent to 7 percent lead over Robertson, the
poll showed.
   However, Bush and Dukakis ended in a virtual tie among voters
who were asked which of the two they would likely vote for in the
general election in November.
   The poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday and was based on
interviews with 845 randomly-selected Wisconsin adults who said
they were absolutely or fairly certain to vote in the primary, the
newspaper said. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
   The Wisconsin primary is expected to draw a large voter turnout
with as many as 1.6 million voters or 45 percent of the eligible
voters participating, state Elections Board officials said.

<HEAD>Jackson Should Get Nomination If He Gets Most Delegates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Democrats and voters leaning
toward the party say Jesse Jackson should get the Democratic
nomination if he leads in delegates at the time of the convention,
according to a Newsweek poll.
   Sixty-six percent of those polled said that if Jackson had more
delegates and more of the popular vote than the other Democratic
candidates _ but not enough to win the Democratic nomination
outright _ the party's other candidates should rally behind him.
   A total of 20 percent said the other candidates should not rally
behind him, according to Sunday's poll.
   And Jackson's negative ratings remain high, with Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis running stronger against Vice President George
Bush than he does.
   Thirteen percent of the respondents in Sunday's survey described
their opinion of Jackson as ``very favorable'' and 40 percent said
their view of him was ``mostly favorable.'' Twenty-four percent
said their opinion of him was ``mostly unfavorable,'' with 14
percent saying it was ``very unfavorable.''
   The Gallup Organization's survey of 757 registered Democratic
and Republican voters telephoned March 30 and 31 showed Bush
leading Dukakis 49 percent to 44 percent; Bush was favored over
Jackson 58 percent to 32 percent, according to Newsweek.
   The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points for
Democrats and for questions directed at Democrats and Republicans,
the margin of error was 4 percentage points.

   Massachussetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds
a 2-1 lead over Jesse Jackson in Ohio with one month left before
the state's primary election, according to two recent polls.
   In a mail poll conducted by The Columbus Dispatch, Dukakis was
chosen by 50 percent of the 1,628 Ohio Democrats surveyed who said
they planned to vote in the May 3 primary. Jackson was second with
23 percent.
   The spread was less dramatic in a University of Akron poll
conducted for the Akron Beacon Journal and WCMH-TV in Columbus and
WKYC-TV in Cleveland.
   Dukakis was the choice of 42 percent of the respondents while 22
percent favored Jackson following the March 26 Michigan primary.
The results from both polls were released Sunday.
   Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign manager and a former political
adviser to Gov. Richard Celeste, told the Akron Beacon Journal
``Ohio is a tough state. But this is April 1. You'll see a
difference May 3.''
   The margin of error in The Dispatch Poll was plus or minus 3
percent on each result.
   The Akron poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.75
percent.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indiana's Republicans are taking a new look
at the party's strategy in 1988, with a focus on women.
   ``It's a universal problem for Republicans,'' admits GOP state
Chairman Gordon K. Durnil about the search for support among women
voters. ``We talk about it at (Republican) National Committee
meetings, we talk about it at state committee meetings and we talk
about it with television consultants.
   ``Society has changed and we now have a majority of women in the
work force,'' he said. ``We need to deal with their concerns.''
   The conservative rhetoric that served Indiana's GOP so well in
the early 1980s is giving way to talk of ``family issues'' and of
support for government-sponsored programs to reduce infant
mortality or provide tax breaks for day care.
   ``Women tend to think more than men do that these are the type
of things that should involve some governmental activism,'' Durnil
said.
   Ten years ago, just over half of all voters in Indiana were men,
according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Today, more than half
are women.

   Five opposition candidates are taking aim at
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party and campaigning for
the presidency with a vengeance not seen before in Mexico.
   With 59 years of experience in winning all major elections, the
governing party, known as the PRI, is all but guaranteed victory
again on July 6 _ and another six years in the nation's top office.
   But opposition candidates are trying new tactics, spurred by
more competition among themselves and PRI candidate Carlos Salinas
de Gortari's identification with Mexico's economic crisis.
   The Conservative National Action Party candidate, Manuel
Clouthier, has ``shadowed'' the PRI candidate, showing up in some
of the same places.
   Heberto Castillo of the Mexican Socialist Party, which includes
most of the left, staged land takeovers with peasants. Other
opposition candidates have participated in other acts of civil
disobedience.
   And Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the National Democratic Front
coalition drew a crowd rivaling the government's on the 50th
anniversary of the expropriation of foreign oil holdings by his
father, ex-president Lazaro Cardenas.
   Candidates have pressured openly for more radio and television
time from the PRI-dominated media and complained that spots have
been refused and stations have failed to broadcast interviews.
   ``Inhibitions have been broken and, as in '68, we face a parting
of the waters in the history of Mexico,'' Castillo said on a recent
campaign stop.
   Castillo, a university professor, was a leader of the 1968
Mexican student movement. He was jailed for 2{ years for his
activities.
   Running a second time for the small radical Revolutionary
Workers' Party is Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, a congresswoman and
leader of a human rights movement. She founded the group and became
politically active after her son disappeared following his arrest
in 1975.
   Gumersindo Magana, a lawyer, is the candidate of the
conservative Mexican Democratic Party.
   Helping ignite the campaign was Cardenas, who led a dissident
PRI movement to fight for election reforms. Barred from the race by
the party hierarchy, the former state governor accepted the
candidacy of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution,
originally a PRI spinoff, and two small leftist parties.
   He is aided by the image of his late father, one of the
country's most revered presidents and probably the last one whom
blue collar workers and peasants thought they could trust.
   He appeals to some who for years have felt there was little
choice.
   While the opposition field generally is stronger than in the
past, Salinas de Gortari also has the disadvantage of being
identified with the country's economic crisis. As budget secretary
until he became the PRI candidate, he was the economic architect
during a time when prices outpaced wages.
   He lacks the charisma that could make up for it, but is
campaigning extensively throughout the country.
   Because of its far-reaching grassroots structure, longtime
monopoly on politics and, at times, alleged ballot fraud, PRI has
swept every election since its founding in 1929. It also has taken
all governorships and Senate seats and most of the congressional
and local races.
   Lorenzo Meyer, academic director of the Colegio de Mexico, a
graduate school, says ``the temptation to resort to alchemy
(election fraud) to keep the opposition from advancing in certain
regions of the country is present.''
   But ``for the victory to be recognized and therefore legitimate,
it will have to be realistic,'' he said in the weekly Punto.
   Jesus Gonzalez Schmal, National Action congressional leader,
said a voter registration list the Interior Department gave the
party last September was padded by about 25 percent with fake names.
   The Socialist Party has called for the opposition to act
together ``with operational and practical means against electoral
fraud.''
   Salinas de Gortari has promised to respect opposition victories.
   In 1982, the PRI won 74 percent of the vote; the six other
presidential candidates 26 percent. In 1976, the PRI candidate was
challenged only by write-ins from two small unregistered parties.
   The government has opened up the system to other parties and
given them congressional seats according to the percentage of the
votes they win.
   Opposition parties hope to win the presidency, but the campaign
also could help them in congressional and local races.
   Author Jorge Castaneda wrote recently of the change in the
magazine Proceso: ``In the bleak ideological plain our country has
been for many years, the saying of Mao constitutes at the same time
a hope and a definite proof of democracy: `May 100 flowers bloom.'

<HEAD>FCC Says It's Running Out of Viable Dial-A-Porn Complaints to
Investigate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
begun investigating two more California dial-a-porn services, but
the agency says it is running out of complaints it can act on.
   ``I keep beating the bushes for new, specific complaints, but we
just don't have a lot of them,'' though the agency gets plenty of
general complaints about dial-a-porn, said Greg Vogt, chief of the
FCC's telephone enforcement division.
   The FCC sent letters last week to two California adult-message
services, Ramrod Enterprises Inc. of Redding, Calif., and 2001
Enterprises of Reseda, Calif., advising them of ``apparent''
violations. They were given 30 days to respond.
   If violations are found, the FCC could levy fines of up to
$50,000 per day for each day a violation occurred. Neither company
was listed with telephone directory assistance and the FCC said it
was unable to obtain phone numbers for the companies or their
owners.
   For the FCC to investigate possible violations of a federal law
prohibiting transmission of sexually explicit messages to children,
the agency needs information such as a phone bill and a statement
that someone under 18 has reached the service without using a
credit card, an access code or a descrambler, Vogt said.

<HEAD>Liberals, Conservatives Unite for Children's Programs That Work,
Save Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberals and conservatives, often at
loggerheads on social programs, are in rare agreement on expanding
eight children's programs, citing independent research that shows
the programs work well and save the government money.
   A report released this weekend by the House Select Committee on
Children, Youth and Families cites specific costs and benefits of
each program as determined by independent research and analysis.
   The findings have convinced liberals and conservatives that they
can be both compassionate and cost-conscious, said Indiana Rep. Dan
Coates, the senior Republican on the committee.
   ``We're working toward a consensus here,'' Coates said. ``I've
seen a decided change in attitude ... on the Republican side about
how we should approach the process of spending.''
   Whereas there was wholesale ``spare-no-program'' cutting in the
early years of the Reagan presidency, Coates said, members are more
discriminating now and willing to spend money on programs that work.
   The largest child-program increases in the House budget
resolution _ a non-binding spending blueprint _ include $210
million for the compensatory education program for children at
academic risk and $170 million for handicapped education. Other
substantial hikes would go to the Women, Infants and Children
program ($150 million) and Head Start ($77 million).

<TEXT>
   Many Nicaraguan exiles here have longed for years
to return to their homeland, but most say they will stay put
despite the sudden prospect of peace there.
   While a few hope to return and rebuild their lives, many are
skeptical of abandoning the security and prosperity of the United
States for an uncertain future and question whether the 9-year-old
leftist Sandinista government will honor the peace accord.
   ``We appreciate not having to worry about who's going to knock
on your door at 3 a.m.,'' said Ronald Lacayo, who left Nicaragua in
1981 and now makes women's sportswear. ``It would take another nine
years to be satisfied it wouldn't happen again.''
   Lacayo doubts he or the 15 countrymen who work for him will go
home despite the cease-fire signed last month by the Sandinistas
and the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras. The pact provides some
political freedom in exchange for Contra recognition of the regime.
   Most of Lacayo's Nicaraguan workers entered the United States
illegally and suffered hardships for years, he said.
   ``They were living three or four families to a home, but after
working hard, they have built themselves good lives,'' said Lacayo.
``They have more opportunity here and none of them are eager to go
back.''
   The peace agreement actually could increase Nicaraguan
immigration, exiles said, because it might make it easier for the
estimated 100,000 exiles in south Florida to bring their familes to
the United States.
   ``Maybe 10,000 will go home,'' said Cristobal Mendoza, who heads
the Nicaraguan Committee of the Poor in Exile. ``But 50,000 or
100,000 more will come in.''
   But even those who don't believe the Sandinistas will keep their
word or readily surrender power are confident that, in the long
run, the Nicaraguan people will achieve a stable, democratic
government that could draw back exiled countrymen.
   ``The Nicaraguan community in large part wants to go home,''
says Mendoza. ``That's why we ask for work permits and not
residency.''
   Perry Rivkind, who heads the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Miami, said few Nicaraguans have called his office
interested in returning. Instead, they fear their asylum status
will be lost and they will be forced to leave the United States.
   He said the INS here issued 32,000 work permits to Nicaraguans
this year alone, and about 300 more apply each week _ truce or not.
   Rivkind says he is reassuring worried exiles that they will not
be shipped back to Nicaragua in the near future despite the peace
accord.
   ``It will take years to review their asylum status, and even if
it is revoked, they have an appeal process,'' he said.
   Rivkind said the exiles, many of them representatives of
Nicaragua's professional and managerial class, consider the peace
agreement meaningless because of their distrust of the Sandinista
government.
   ``I will work day and night to keep Nicaraguans here in Miami,''
said Roberto Arguello, influential head of the Nicaraguan American
Bankers Association.
   ``Nobody will move from the city of Miami, and Nicaraguans will
continue to come into the United States in record numbers,'' he
predicted.
   He said Nicaragua should not expect the return of its private
sector, its professionals or even laborers until the Sandinistas
have left.
   However, there are a few exceptions _ surprisingly among the
Contras who until last month were locked in a bloody struggle with
the Sandinistas.
   Jorge Rosales, longtime spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance,
as the Contras are formally known, said he hopes to be home within
a few months after the treaty goes into effect, but only if the
Sandinistas respect its terms.
   ``I will immediately go back to help my family,'' said Rosales.
``People have a role to play, and this is mine. The more middle
class we have, the better.''

<HEAD>Republican Mounts Long-Shot Challenge to Kennedy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Malone concedes he is letting his
instincts overrule common sense by launching a longshot Republican
challenge to a political institution, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   But Malone, a state Republican Party official, offers few
apologies.
   ``There are some people who are analysts in this world and they
sit down and they look at every single number and different factor
involved in deciding whether they want to run,'' Malone said in an
interview last week. ``But I'm the type of person who moves on
instinct.''
   The former Harvard football player on Tuesday will formally
announce his first bid for political office, a run against the
26-year Senate veteran.
   Malone, 33, has served as executive director of the
Massachusetts Republican Party for the past year, working the
telephones and political functions trying to breathe new life into
a party that claims no statewide offices and is an overwhelming
minority in both chambers of the Legislature.
   Malone has won high praise for loyalty, a trait Democrats and
Republicans alike say brought him into the race against Kennedy at
a time when the state GOP is hard-pressed to find strong
challengers to Democratic incumbents.
   Kennedy has not faced a tough re-election challenge since the
Massachusetts Democrat was first elected to the Senate in 1962 in
his maiden run for office.
   Malone was a field organizer in Massachusetts for Repubublican
presidential candidate John Connally in 1980 and worked on current
state GOP Chairman Ray Shamie's two unsuccessful Senate runs, in
1982 against Kennedy and in 1984 against John Kerry.
   When Shamie ruled out another run against Kennedy, Malone
stepped forward.
   Most state political observers believe Malone's goal is to gain
the name recognition needed for a successful statewide run in 1990,
when the possible departure of Gov. Michael Dukakis from the state
political scene could result in a tumultuous shakeup in state
government.
   The national GOP has pledged $400,000 to Malone, and he hopes to
raise $600,000 on his own. Republicans make no secret of the fact
that they want to force Kennedy to campaign at home to limit the
time he can work for the party's presidential nominee.

<HEAD>Dukakis To Iacocca: Reconsider Kenosha Plant Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis, two days before Wisconsin's primary, is challenging
Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca's planned closing of a Kenosha
plant that would eliminate 5,500 jobs.
   In a letter sent to Iacocca, Dukakis told the automaker
executive he had supported government financial help for Chrysler
in 1979 when the company was struggling.
   ``In fact, I felt so strongly about it that I purchased one of
your automobiles,'' he added. ``I admired what labor and management
did to save and rebuild the company, and I considered you a fair
and concerned employer.
   ``The recent events at the Kenosha plant here in Wisconsin have
changed my mind about your fairness and your concern,'' he wrote.
   ``A good manager does not promise or guarantee some 5,000 people
jobs and then change his or her mind,'' Dukakis wrote. ``Workers
must be treated as partners, not as replacement parts in some
obsolete machine. Communities and the people in them cannot be cast
aside when no longer needed....''
   He asked that Iacocca ``keep your promise to the workers and
community and reconsider your decision to close the Kenosha plant.''
   The letter was released by the campaign staff of the
Massachusetts governor Sunday night _ two days before the Wisconsin
presidential primary election in which Dukakis and Jesse Jackson
are considered the front-runners.
   Will Robinson of the Dukakis campaign staff said the idea for
the letter developed out of a meeting the governor had with local
labor officials in Kenosha Saturday.
   Chrysler announced Jan. 27 it would shut down auto assembly and
metal stamping facilities in Kenosha by Sept. 30. State officials
have contended Chrysler officials promised last year that car
production would continue there for five years.
   Jackson, who has been endorsed by Local 72 of the United Auto
Workers Union _ the local at the Kenosha plant, traveled to Kenosha
to address workers shortly after Chrysler announced the plant would
be shut down in mid-summer.
   Last week, another Democratic presidential candidate, Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., ran a television ad that attacked the Kenosha
shutdown by Chrysler.
   That ad prompted Chrysler to issue a statement, released
Thursday by spokeswoman Karen Stewart, saying the public would be
better served by candidates ``addressing real issues such as trade
and the budget deficit rather than exploiting unfortunate
situations like plant closings.''

   His mother sometimes wishes he had picked a
different profession, but Jim Bagian has waited seven years to fly
on a space shuttle and he's not about to let the Challenger tragedy
dash his dream.
   ``Commercial airliners crash, too,'' Bagian said. ``That doesn't
stop you from doing things. We want to get going.
   ``One of these days if we keep flying the shuttle, we'll
probably have another accident. That's just life, the way it goes.
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it,'' he said.
   Bagian, 36, a physician and engineer who became an astronaut in
1981, learned two weeks ago that he has been selected for one of
the shuttle crews that hope to put the space program back on its
feet. The program has been grounded since seven astronauts died
when the Challenger exploded as it lifted off from Kennedy Space
Center on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Bagian's mother, Rose, realized her worst fears about her son's
profession during the Challenger disaster.
   ``It brought home that it can happen,'' she said. Still, she
said she knows better than to try to talk her son out of it.
   Karl Scherzberg, a longtime friend from high school and Drexel
University, said he never heard Bagian reconsider his commitment to
the shuttle program. ``I'm sure after the accident he's been
thinking about the reliability of systems and equipment,''
Scherzberg said. ``But there hasn't really been a difference in him
because the accident only confirmed what he knew already about
risk.''
   Bagian said he may have inherited his coolheadedness and love of
aviation from his father, Philip, a World War II fighter pilot.
   Philip Bagian said his son is someone who ``was always at the
top of his class in everything'' and ``may have traded security for
the uniqueness of being an astronaut.''
   Bagian had worked with five of the Challenger crew members. He
also had been assigned to fly on the Challenger in other 1986
missions before all manned U.S. space flights were put on hold.
   If anything, Bagian said the Challenger disaster may have given
him more confidence ``because we've looked at everything again.''
   The accident was blamed on a flawed joint in the side of the
solid rocket booster. The side joints have been redesigned, along
with parts of the rocket booster nozzle.
   Bagian, who is stationed at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
has been working on the escape system and astronauts' pressure
suits.
   The first of the shuttle flights, on the Discovery, is set for
Aug. 4, followed by an all-military crew flight on the Atlantis on
Oct. 27.
   Bagian's flight, also on the Discovery, is scheduled to launch
Jan. 19. The flight's misson is to release the third in a series of
tracking and data relay satellites for communications.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson
says he has a divine mandate to run for president and will not stop
until he is in the White House.
   Robertson conceded that Vice President George Bush all but has
the Republican nomination assured for 1988, but said he would run
again in 1992.
   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _
running for President of the United States,'' Robertson told an
estimated crowd of 3,000 people at the Happy Church in south Denver.
   ``Out of what seems to be defeat we are laying the foundation
for a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... but
I am not going to quit,'' Robertson said.
   ``That is His plan for me and for this nation.''
   The former television evangelist delivered his Easter message as
Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson prepared to preach to
a packed congregation across town at First Baptist Church.
   Later, both candidates spoke at Colorado Springs.
   Robertson and Jackson spent the weekend in Colorado trying to
solidify support prior to today's caucuses when the two parties
will begin choosing delegates to the upcoming national conventions.
Democratic candidate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis also
campaigned in Colorado on Saturday.
   Robertson has conceded he has virtually no chance of winning but
said he hopes he can influence the GOP platform that will be drawn
up at the national convention in August.
   ``I'm just visiting to encourage some of the people here,''
Robertson said Sunday. ``I want them to know that I'm doing work on
the caucuses.''
   Robertson's remarks on Sunday echoed statements he had made
Saturday while campaigning in Denver. ``I am going to be the
champion of the Christian and conservative points of view ... if it
takes until 1992 to do it,'' he told a rally of about 400 people at
the Sheraton Denver Tech Center.
   Robertson, who last year gave up his credentials as a Southern
Baptist ministe and has said he no longer want to be identified as
a ``television evangelist,'' spoke to four different congregations
in the Denver area during a three-hour period. His message centered
on the hope of the resurrection as he assured churchgoers his own
campaign is not dead.
   ``The cross lost it for Satan and won it for us. I want to
encourage all of you today that we are not finished. We are just
warming up,'' he said as churchgoers showed their approval with
nods and ``Amens.''
   During his appearance at the New Life Baptist Church in Colorado
Springs, Robertson also told more than 1,000 supporters that the
nation has a moral and not a governmental problem.
   But societal problems continue to grow because government
agencies assist by giving contraceptives to teen-agers and by
proposing that clean needles be given to drug users to help prevent
the spread of AIDS he said.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo
announced a one-week delay in peace talks between the Sandinista
government and rebel forces, but said the postponement was no cause
for alarm for Nicaraguans.
   ``It's sad for our people,'' the cardinal said during Mass
Sunday at the Las Sierritas church in Managua. But he said
afterward ``the important thing is that during these 60 days there
is compliance with what has been agreed upon.''
   A 60-day cease-fire signed March 23 went into effect Friday, and
the Defense Ministry reported no violations as of Sunday.
   High-ranking Sandinista and Contra representatives were to meet
on Wednesday in Managua to continue discussions on a permanant
truce. But the U.S.-supported Contras sought a delay to April 12.
   The Contras gave three reasons for the delay:
   _the technical talks aimed at working out the mechanics of the
60-day cease-fire were not completed.
   _the Sandinistas did not freed all the prisoners the rebels had
asked for when the government freed 100 political prisoners March
29.
   _the government violated the cease-fire's provision for full
press freedom in Nicaragua by withholding newsprint to the
opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   Nevertheless, Contra leader Adolfo Calero said in a telephone
from Miami on Saturday that the rebel delegation would rejoin the
talks on April 12.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco criticized the proposed
delay in a letter released Saturday.
   However, Obando y Bravo's acknowledgement Sunday that the talks
would take place on April 12 indicated the government had accepted
the later meeting date.
   The cardinal was an observer to the negotiations that resulted
in peace terms signed in the southern border town of Sapoa.
   In a technical meeting held March 28-29, Contra and Sandinista
officials designated five zones inside Nicaragua where Contra
fighters could gather during the first two weeks of April. But they
failed to establish in detail the zones or security measures for
the rebels.
   The government blamed the Contras for the delay. Technical
committees from both sides are set to meet again in Sapoa on
Tuesday.
   Obando y Bravo said during Mass he was ``satisfied with the
progress'' of the peace talks, adding, ``I have a lot of hope on
this Easter Sunday.''
   ``The mountains are silent ... Enough of death, a step toward
life,'' he said to cheers and applause from the Easter worshipers.

<HEAD>Milton A. Caniff, Creator of `Terry and the Pirates' and `Steve
Canyon'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milton A. Caniff, who for half a century took
Americans on daring adventures through the comic pages with ``Terry
and the Pirates'' and ``Steve Canyon,'' has died of lung cancer. He
was 81.
   Caniff, who had entered Beth Israel Hospital on Feb. 29, died
Sunday at his home, according to a spokesman for King Features,
which syndicated the strips.
   Caniff set a standard for realistic drawing and quickly
enthralled Depression-era readers with tales of danger in the Far
East in ``Terry and the Pirates,'' which debuted in 1934 in the
Daily News.
   He left the paper to join Marshall Field and the Chicago Sun
Syndicate in 1946 with a new hero, ``Steve Canyon,'' a fictional
Air Force colonel who proved so popular he was eventually given his
own file at the Pentagon.
   Always attuned to what sells newspapers, Caniff liked to quote
his high school art teacher in Dayton, Ohio: ``Unless a piece of
art inspired the viewer to part with cash money to acquire it, then
the drawing was not worth a hoot.''
   But his technique was among the very best, and he was honored as
the ``Rembrandt of comic strips'' at an exhibition at the Museum of
Cartoon Art in 1985. He said he belonged to the ``every wrinkle
must show'' school of art.
   At the Dayton Daily News, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mike
Peters described Caniff as ``the grandaddy of cartoonists.''
   ``He was in the inner circle with Rube Goldberg, Al Capp, Walt
Kelly and those guys,'' Peters said. ``He was revered by all of us.
He had some of the best drafted strips ever done.''
   Ted Hannah, a spokesman for King Features, said Caniff continued
to work until very near his death, with his longtime assistant,
Shel Dorf of California. Hannah said a decision on the future of
``Steve Canyon'' would be made this week.
   Caniff's cartooning career began with ``Dickie Dare'' and ``The
Gay Thirties'' for The Associated Press.
   He was soon approached by Capt. Joseph M. Patterson, publisher
of the News, who asked for an adventure strip packed with comedy,
romance and adventure and set in the Orient, which Patterson
regarded as the last outpost of adventure.
   By 1946, ``Terry and the Pirates'' was in more than 300
newspapers and Caniff was making $75,000 per year. But he wanted to
own a cartoon, and he developed ``Steve Canyon,'' for which he was
paid $2,000 a week and owned the rights.
   Despite occasional complaints about violence, ``Steve Canyon''
kept flying and fighting, and early this year it was in more than
500 newspapers around the world, according to King Features.
   Caniff was awarded the Air Force Exceptional Service Award, its
highest civilian honor.
   Caniff was a meticulous researcher, and some of the plots in
``Terry and the Pirates'' anticipated actual events in World War
II, such as the Japanese attack on the United States. One of his
memorable creations was the Dragon Lady, who was inspired by Joan
Crawford.
   When a ``Terry'' character named Raven Sherman was killed in
1941, Caniff received thousands of cards, letters and flowers, and
he recalled that an elevator operator called him a murderer.
   ``Terry and the Pirates'' was continued by George Wunder until
the strip ended in 1973. Wunder died last December.
   Caniff was born Feb. 28, 1907, in Hillsboro, Ohio, and by
kindergarten was drawing recognizable human figures on scrap paper
brought home by his father, a printer.
   His first job was drawing cartoons for the Boy Scout page in the
Dayton Journal Herald when he was 13. He also worked for the
Columbus Dispatch while at Ohio State University, where he earned a
fine arts degree.
   Phlebitis prevented Caniff from joining the military.
   ``It was something I always wanted to do. It was like a small
boy who dreams of catching the game-winning touchdown or rescuing
the heroine from the villain. Fortunately, the strips have allowed
me to have a close association with the military,'' Caniff once
said.
   Many of his strips had touches of autobiography and his Ohio
boyhood, and friends often were prototypes for characters in the
strip. Recently Caniff drew several weeks of strips based on his
courtship of his future wife, Ester Parsons, at Stivers High
School. They were married in 1930.
   He donated most of his original material to Ohio State's Milton
Caniff Library for Communications and Graphic Arts, according to
Walter K. Bunge, director of the university's School of Journalism.
   Caniff received at least three honorary doctorates, including
one from the University of Dayton, and numerous other awards. He
also was a founder of the National Cartoonists Society.
   He is survived by his wife, Ester.
   Funeral services were to be announced by the Frank E. Campbell

   Juan Gonzalez passed another bottle of
beer to a waitress, smiled and noted it was a good sign that 15 or
so patrons were getting uproariously drunk in the dimly lit bar of
his shabby riverside inn.
   ``It hasn't been like this,'' Gonzalez said, shaking his head.
``This shows that peace is coming, that we need peace, that the
people believe it will happen. Nowhere has the war had such an
impact.''
   He said residents of this northern village have been rejoicing
since the March 23 signing of the cease-fire agreement between the
Soviet-financed Sandinistas and the U.S.-supplied Contras.
   ``The people have been afraid for years,'' he said, offering a
grin that showed off his two gold-capped front teeth. ``We all got
happy when we heard.'' Gonzalez's rundown guest house, which
doesn't have a name, is located on the banks of the winding Coco
River in the village of Wiwili in Nuevo Segovia, about 150 miles
northeast of Managua.
   The hamlet, located among steep hills parched from the lack of
rain, became a government fortress a few years ago as battles
heated up.
   ``We were well protected,'' Gonzalez said. ``But we couldn't
leave.''
   The village hosts military bases and many government supporters.
Soviet-made cannons and anti-aircraft guns sit atop the hillsides.
East German troop trucks stand ready. Almost all of the men,
civilians and soldiers, tote AK-47 automatic rifles.
   The surrounding mountains, not far from the Honduran border to
the north, have been rife with Contra activity since the rebels
began fighting in 1981 to overthrow the Sandinistas.
   ``No To Communism,'' says graffiti painted on a nearby building.
   The so-called Pantasma Highway, the only route from the south,
was said to be so dangerous that even truck drivers bringing food
and supplies feared to enter. The battered hulks of army troop
trucks mined or ambushed lie along the dirt road.
   To the west, the narrow mountain road from Quilali offered equal
danger of attack. A plaque on the side of the road at one point
listed the names of civilians killed when a mine blew up under
their truck.
   The only other access is by foot, which offers little protection
from ambush, or by the Coco River. But this time of year the water
levels are too low for river travel.
   ``People used to whisper when they had to go to Jinotega (to the
south) or to Quilali,'' Gonzalez said. ``They'd make the sign of
the cross. It was terrible. But just last week I started to see the
difference.''
   The inn owner recalled battles in the outlying hills a few
months ago. He said the bodies of government soldiers would pass
through daily.
   ``I know other parts have suffered, but I can't believe it's as
much as we have,'' he said. ``We can't stand any more.''
   Gonzalez's teen-age son has served eight months of his mandatory
two-year stretch.
   ``He still has more than a year to go,'' Gonzalez signed.
``Maybe if there is peace...''
   But one customer, Ariel Antonio Garcia, said: ``We want peace
but the Contras have to surrender.''
   The 24-year-old recounted how the National Guard that operated
under the late President Anastasio Somoza killed his parents and
how he believed all the Contras were related to the guards.
   The Sandinista revolution ousted Somoza in July 1979. The
Contras, with the backing of the United States, began fighting 1{
years later.
   About 25 miles southeast of Wiwili, a group of Contras roamed
freely last week under the command of a 24-year-old leader.
Comandante Ernesto, as he is known, echoed Garcia's words about the
desire for peace but maintained the Sandinistas should have fully
established democracy.
   The young men served as an example of the deep wounds left from
years of propaganda and battles that have killed or wounded more
than 50,000.
   There have been reports by the Contras that renegades among
their troops have staged attacks in violation of the truce enacted
March 21, at the start of the talks produced the cease-fire
agreement.
   Gonzalez said there were rifle and mortar fire exchanges outside
Wiwili last week. Hours before the official 60-day cease-fire
started Friday, the only sounds along the river were of barking
dogs, crickets and roosters.
   But a little more than an hour after midnight, the sound of an
AK rifle was heard. It came again about a half-hour later.
   ``It was probably just someone who had too much to drink,'' a
resident said the next morning.

<HEAD>Studies Show Teens Have Greater Resistance To AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-agers may be more resistant to the virus
that causes AIDS than other age groups, but they have no better
success in fighting the disease once they get it, according to
research cited in a published report.
   Three recent studies have indicated that teens who are infected
with the AIDS virus are likely to remain free of the disease for
longer than adults or infants, The New York Times reported in its
Sunday editions.
   The Times cited three recent studies of hemophilia patients who
have become infected with the AIDS virus.
   Although the results are preliminary, ``Everything is pointing
in the same direction,'' said Dr. Edward Gomperts of the Children's
Hospital of Los Angeles. ``It is striking.''
   Dr. James Goedert, who is conducting a study at the National
Cancer Institute, said AIDS could resemble chicken pox, measles and
other diseases that are more severe in adults than children.
   ``Whatever controls AIDS in children and teen-agers really needs
to be pursued,'' he said. ``It may have important implications for
treatments and vaccines.''
   In the National Cancer Institute's study of 89 hemophiliacs in
Hershey, Pa., 35 percent of the adults had symptoms of AIDS seven
years after their infection, compared to only 10 percent of those
who were infected as teen-agers.
   In a study Gomperts is conducting at Children's Hospital,
researchers have been keeping track of 30 adult hemophiliacs and 90
adolescents and children who were infected with the virus in the
early 1980s. So far, five of the adults, but only two of the
adolescents and children, have contracted acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   In the third study, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
also found greater resistance to the disease among teen-age
hemophilia patients than among adults, Dr. Janine Jason said.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, contaminated
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of March 21, 57,024 U.S. cases have been reported to the CDC.
Of those, 31,836, or 56 percent, have died.

<HEAD>Easter Brings Plea For Peace From Pope, Anglican Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF DONN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Christians braved Israeli-Palestinian tensions in the Holy Land,
prayed in England for an end to Northern Ireland's religious
bloodshed and listened worldwide to Pope John Paul II's Easter plea
for peace.
   Elsewhere on Sunday, traditional passion plays took place in
Brazil and chaplains delivered services aboard U.S. warships in the
Persian Gulf.
   In Hungary, men prepared for today's more frivolous dousing of
women with perfume during the traditional ``sprinkling spree.''
   In Vatican City, 100,000 people gathered in St. Peter Square on
Sunday to hear the pope's Easter message, which had a broadcast
audience of millions.
   ``Pray for peace in the world, for justice, pray for the rights
of man, especially for religious freedom,'' the Roman Catholic
leader said.
   In Jerusalem, about 1,000 faithful joined in services Sunday at
the site where most Christians believe Jesus rose from the dead.
   But only about half as many people came as last year to the
services at the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, church
officials said. Many had been deterred by four months of
Palestinian protests and Israeli crackdowns in the occupied
territories that have left more than 135 Arabs dead.
   In Canterbury, England, Anglican Archbishop Robert Runcie
compared the March 19 slaying of two British soldiers at an Irish
Republican Army funeral in Northern Ireland to Christ's crucifixion.
   The two soldiers were shot to death in a predominantly Roman
Catholic district of west Belfast after they were beaten by
mourners heading to the burial of an IRA guerrilla.
   Runcie said in his Easter sermon that Christ's death was ``a
dark death, as dark in the cruelty and hatred which attended it as
were the deaths of those two young soldiers in Belfast a fortnight
ago.''
   But he said the joyous memory of Christ's resurrection should
give hope for an end to Northern Ireland's sectarian violence.
   In Belfast, thousands marched peacefully to mark the 1916 Easter
uprising against British rule in what is now the neighboring
Republic of Ireland.
   In Hungary, men were stocking up on eau de cologne for today's
``sprinkling spree'' when they rove in groups perfuming girls and
women. The custom is believed to stem partly from ancient fertility
rites.
   At St. Stanislaw Kostka church in northern Warsaw, where the
slain pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko is buried, a Christ
figure was draped in a banner in the red lettering of the outlawed
trade federation.
   It read: ``We will rise again.''
   In the Czechoslovak capital of Prague, 2,000 believers attended
an Easter Mass at St. Vitus Cathedral just over a week after riot
police broke up a peaceful demonstration for religious freedom in
Bratislava.
   In the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq are at war, skippers of
16 U.S. Navy ships marked Easter with messages to their crews.
Religious services were held aboard several vessels.
   More than 10,000 people took part Sunday in peace marches in
West Germany's major cities and at several U.S. military
installations there. The traditional Easter weekend marches are
held for world peace and the destruction of nuclear weapons.
   Brazil, the world's most populous Catholic nation, celebrated
Easter with traditional passion plays recounting Christ's
crucifixion. In Rio de Janeiro, many of the main roles, including
that of Jesus, were for the first time played by blacks in keeping
with the church's equality campaign.
   About 90 percent of Brazil's 135 million people are Roman
Catholic.

<HEAD>Carter Considered Swapping Military Parts For Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Carter administration scuttled a 1980 plan to
swap military parts for the 52 American hostages in Tehran when it
began to doubt that its Iranian go-between had his government's
backing, a newspaper reported.
   Newly declassified documents, mostly Carter-era CIA and State
Department memos, provide the first detailed account of President
Carter's efforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980
election, which Ronald Reagan won by a landslide, The Miami Herald
reported Sunday.
   The documents were turned over to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich,
chairman of the House Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee, as
part of his investigation into whether Reagan's 1980 campaign made
a secret arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   Under the Reagan administration, the U.S. sold arms to Iran in
exchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon.
Funds from the sale were diverted to Contra rebels at a time when
such aid was banned by Congress.
   President Carter considered offering $10 million in military
spare parts for the 52 Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran, according to the Herald.
   However, his administration backed away from the plan after
deciding that arms dealer Houshang Lavi did not have the backing of
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, then president of Iran, the newspaper
reported.
   Lavi, an Iranian-born resident of Long Island, N.Y., became
involved with the Carter administration after first contacting the
campaign of independent presidential candidate John Anderson. The
documents gave no indication whether the Reagan campaign was
approached.
   The papers include CIA memos to Carter's National Security
Council chief David Aaron and State Department memos by then-deputy
assistant secretary Harold Saunders.
   One of the CIA memos dated Oct. 3, 1980, mentioned a
conversation between an unidentified agency officer and Lavi in
which Lavi offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a a
seven-page list of F-14 parts.
   Lavi ``wished to arrange the delivery to Iran of $8 to $10
million of F-14 spare parts,'' the memo said, adding he ``would
arrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spare
parts'' and U.S. agreement to unfreeze Iranian assets, forgive
claims against Iran and stay out of internal Iranian affairs.
   The CIA officer recommended against pursuing the offer.
   The memos indicate Carter officials ended contacts with Lavi on
Oct. 19, 1980, after a foreign ambassador in Tehran reported that
Bani-Sadr had not been aware of Lavi's offer.
   WLS-TV in Chicago reported on Oct. 15, 1980, that
arms-for-hostages talks were under way, and a 1984 congressional
investigation concluded the leak came from a ``highly placed member
of the U.S. intelligence community'' associated with the Reagan
campaign.

<TEXT>
   Four more soldiers jailed in plots
against President Corazon Aquino were missing following the weekend
escape of the leader of an August coup attempt, the military said
today.
   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo also denied that
troops had raided a vacation home of opposition Sen. Juan Ponce
Enrile in connection with the nationwide search for former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan.
   Honasan, 39, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt, and 14 guards
fled a prison ship in Manila Bay before dawn Saturday aboard two
rubber dinghies. He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9
for the attempted coup that left at least 53 people dead and
hundreds wounded.
   Florendo said three officers and one enlisted man jailed in
connection with the August attempt and another in January 1987 were
missing from the detention center at Villamor Air Base.
   Florendo claimed, however, the four apparently fled because of
``family problems'' and their escape was not related to the Honasan
incident.
   An earlier report by a Manila newspaper, citing an unidentified
air force officer, put the figure at nine soldiers who had escaped.
   Military officials said earlier that troops Sunday raided
Enrile's vacation house in Batangas province, southwest of Manila,
as part of a search of a seaside vacation resort. But Florendo
denied Enrile's house had been raided.
   Enrile told a radio station today he had heard of the raid and
charged the government was acting illegally by entering homes
without search warrants.
   Honasan served as chief of security at the Ministry of National
Defense when Enrile was defense chief. Enrile was fired in November
1986, after an alleged coup attempt by his followers.
   Manila newspapers have reported that leaflets were circulating
in military camps calling for the overthrow of the government. The
leaflets allegedly were from Honasan's Reform the Armed Forces
Movement, the papers said.
   Florendo said a nationwide search was under way for Honasan but
that raids so far had failed because ``either we were too late or
perhaps the information was not so accurate.''
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos today told reporters the military
was investigating ``all angles'' of the incident, ``including
alleged foreign intervention in the escape of Honasan.'' Ramos did
not elaborate.
   Leftist Rep. Venancio Garduce has charged that Americans may
have helped Honasan escape to pressure the government as it begins
talks with the United States this week on the status of U.S.
military bases in the Philippines.
   Presidential sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mrs. Aquino had demanded a full-scale investigation into the
Honasan escape because she did not believe it was simply a result
of negligence.
   The skipper of the prison ship was arrested Saturday, but the
sources said Mrs. Aquino believed others in the chain of command
should be punished.
   Mrs. Aquino told a student group on Sunday that her government
was stable enough to withstand any new coup attempt and that
Honasan's escape ``does not in any way discourage us in what we set
out to do.''
   The government has survived about six major coup attempts and
conspiracies since Mrs. Aquino took office on Feb. 25, 1986.
   Investigators said Honasan and the others fled the prison ship
aboard rubber dinghies and came ashore near the Folk Arts Center, a
few hundred yards from the headquarters of the Philippine navy.
They then boarded seven cars which had been waiting for them,
investigators said.
   Officials said Honasan left behind a note when he fled the ship
saying he was escaping because ``the struggle for a better AFP
(Armed Forces of the Philippines) must go on.''
   Honasan played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986,
civilian-military uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos
and brought Mrs. Aquino to power. But Honasan later accused Mrs.
Aquino of weak and inept leadership in the face of the 19-year-old
communist insurgency.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls in Tokyo, European Markets Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell briefly today to a three-month low
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo, then recovered somewhat.
   Financial markets in Europe were closed today for the long
Easter holiday weekend. Most European centers also were closed on
Good Friday.
   Gold wasn't traded in London, Zurich or Hong Kong on either day.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.85 yen, down 0.25 yen from
Friday's close of 124.10 yen. The closing figure was up from toay's
opening of 123.70 yen, its lowest opening level since Jan. 5 when
it started trading at 123 yen.
   ``There was nothing to motivate the market particularly, though
the market sentiment was not to buy dollars,'' said Hiraki Abe, an
analyst with the Bank of Tokyo. Abe said the Bank of Japan was
believed to have stepped into the market to a moderate degree to
prop up the dollar.
   Here are the most recent dollar rates in Europe, on Friday,
compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6565 West German marks, up from 1.6555
   _1.3650 Swiss francs, up from 1.3635
   _5.6270 French francs, up from 5.6130
   _1.8595 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8575
   _1,228.75 Italian lire, down from 1,229.50
   _1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2339
   Also on Friday, the British pound was quoted at $1.8895 _ a
six-year high for the second day in a row _ compared with $1.8878
Thursday.

<HEAD>Jackson Looks to Turn Crowd Response into Caucus Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After evoking emotional responses
from large crowds across much of Colorado, Jesse Jackson is hoping
to ``translate this commitment to massive turnout'' in statewide
caucuses today and Wisconsin's important primary a day later.
   The Democratic presidential hopeful flew back to Milwaukee late
Sunday to resume his Wisconsin campaigning after two days in
Colorado where he drew crowds that numbered in the thousands _ so
large they spilled out of churches, hotel rooms and even an airport
hangar where he spoke.
   Jackson also said he hoped soon to have a full report from a
friend whom he had sent to meet with Panama's military strongman,
Manuel Antonio Noriega. Jackson had sent a message to Noriega last
month calling for him to leave the Central American country.
   Jackson said he was willing to do what he could to encourage
Noriega to leave but that he had not offered to mediate the
dispute. ``That's too strong a word,'' he said.
   He said he had sent a friend, Cirilo McSween of Chicago, who
once lived in Panama, to meet with Noriega. ``I do not have an
official response yet,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson's big crowds came as his campaign reported its biggest
fund-raising success ever _ $2.1 million during March, three times
the amount of his best previous month.
   He capped his Easter weekend campaign with a rally at the
Colorado Springs airport. He was greeted by some 1,500 people
crowded into a large hangar, where some climbed on steel beams
along the walls, children sat on three small planes lining the
rear, and scores more stood outside unable to get in.
   They shrieked when he entered, shouted his name in unison, and
pressed to touch him when he was finished. Jackson seemed touched
by the outpouring.
   ``This excitement in this place today _ and in Greeley, Pueblo
and Aspen yesterday, Denver and now Colorado Springs today _
wherever we go, hope is speaking across our nation,'' Jackson said,
looking at the mix of white, black and Hispanic faces. ``Your
presence is a source of inspiration.''
   Jackson, the black civil rights leader and minister, preached
Easter sermons at a predominantly white Baptist church in Denver.
He invoked the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. on the eve of the
20th anniversary of his death, and used the symbolism of Easter and
the renewal of hope in describing the end of President Reagan's
administration.
   Some 1,500 people jammed inside the church, and another 1,500 to
2,000 were outside. Jackson then was greeted by another 1,000 to
1,500 people inside and outside a jammed Catholic church in a
predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, where people lined the street
for a block. Later, he spoke to 3,000 or more people in Denver
Auditorium Arena, mixing calls for compassion for the poor with
criticism of Reagan.
   A day earlier Jackson had drawn large crowds too, including some
2,000 for an outdoor rally in Pueblo, the same city where rival
Michael Dukakis drew a crowd estimated at 300.
   ``We must translate this commitment to massive turnout at the
caucuses tomorrow night,'' Jackson told the arena crowd.
   Sitting in the congregation for his sermons were former
presidential candidate Gary Hart and his wife Lee, and Denver's
politically embattled Hispanic mayor, Federico Pena.
   Support from Hispanics is considered important in Colorado's
caucuses, as they make up at least 12 percent of the Democratic
vote and their neighborhoods often have high turnouts. Jackson
pursued their vote with his trip to the Our Lady of Guadalupe
Catholic Church.
   Jackson has met strikingly large and emotional crowds since he
campaigned in Michigan a week and a half ago and won there in a
landslide. While he has drawn big crowds in Wisconsin, too, a
weekend Milwaukee Journal poll had him trailing Dukakis by 8
percentage points.
   At each event in Colorado, Jackson displayed a showman's flare
for evoking poignant scenes, even as he spoke in generalities and
avoided specifics. At every stop he picked up babies or toddlers,
and at Denver's arena he gathered scores of young children around
him for cheers and chants.
   He called forward a 102-year-old black woman, Ada March, to
speak to the crowd.
   ``I never thought I'd live to see this day _ when one of our own
would be running for president: Jesse Jackson'' she said. ``It's
wonderful. You never know what will happen to you in life.''

   The dollar fell briefly to a three-month low
against the Japanese yen before recovering slightly today, while
stock prices slipped after moderate gains to close higher in Tokyo
trading.
   The dollar closed at 123.85 yen, down 0.25 yen from Friday's
close of 124.10 yen. The closing figure was up from today's opening
of 123.70 yen, its lowest opening level since Jan. 5 when it
started trading at 123 yen.
   ``There was nothing to motivate the market particularly, though
the market sentiment was not to buy dollars,'' said Hiraki Abe, an
analyst with the Bank of Tokyo. ``With Japanese economic growth in
the past few months, foreign and institutional investors have been
buying a lot in Tokyo, driving the yen higher.''
   Abe said the Bank of Japan was believed to have stepped into the
market to a moderate degree to prop up the dollar, which at one
point fell to 123.45 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 177.90 points during Saturday's
half-day of trading, today gained another 53.17 points, or 0.2
percent, to move to 26,335.29 at the end of the day's trading.
   The market had risen more than 130 yen but fell back shortly
before the end of closing.
   ``Prices were going up, and that made investors wary and move to
the sidelines,'' another analyst at a major Japanese bank said.
   Traders said investors moved aside out of concern over how New
York Stocks might react to a sharp decline for U.S. treasuries in
Tokyo trading.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares,
down from 1.3 billion shares during Friday's session, the last
full-day of trading. An estimated 520 million shares changed hands
during Saturday's morning session.

   Meanwhile, severe flooding was expected from southeast Kansas to
northeast Oklahoma along the Neosho River. The river was to crest
about 6 feet above flood stage today, with low-lying areas of
Miami, Okla., expecting damage.
   But after several days of very active weather in the midsection
of the nation, with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes over Indiana
and Michigan on Sunday, few storms were reported this morning.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from New York
across parts of Pennsylvania and the upper Ohio Valley and the
mid-Atlantic states to the southern Appalachians.
   Clear skies were widespread from the lower Ohio Valley across
the central and lower Mississippi Valley, the central and southern
Plains and the southern Rockies to southern California.
   Temperatures were on the mild side. The East Coast states were
especially mild with early morning readings in the 60s from
southern Pennsylvania to northern Florida.
   The forecast for today called for showers and thunderstorms from
the central Gulf coast region and Florida across the East Coast
states to New England; scattered showers from northern Michigan to
Minnesota; rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest across
Idaho and northern Utah to the northern and central Rockies; and
windy conditions near the Rocky Mountains.
   Highs were expected in the 70s or 80s across much of the nation;
the 40s over Washington state; the 50s or 60s from Oregon and
northern California to the northern and central Rockies; the 50s or
60s from North Dakota across the upper Mississippi Valley and the
Great Lakes region to the north Atlantic states; and the lower 90s
in southwest Texas and the desert southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29
degrees at Baker, Ore., to 76 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Panchen Lama Says More Than 200 Arrested In Tibetan Protest</HEAD>

   More than 200 people were arrested following a
bloody March 5 independence protest in Tibet, but most have been
released, the Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's No. 2 leader, said
today.
   It was the first time an official figure has been given for the
number of arrests linked to the demonstration, during which
thousands of Tibetans stoned Chinese armed police and burned
vehicles to protest more than 37 years of Chinese Communist rule.
   Foreign reporters have not been allowed into Tibet's capital,
Lhasa, since the protest, but Western travelers there have reported
widespread arrests with estimates ranging up to 1,000.
   The Panchen Lama, speaking at a televised news conference, also
said five people died during the violence, including one policeman,
a Tibetan monk hit by stones, two lay Tibetans shot by police ``in
self-defense,'' and a layman who later died in the hospital of
injuries.
   The Western travelers quoted Tibetans as saying 21 Tibetans and
three Chinese were killed. Official reports mentioned only the dead
policeman, and the Panchen Lama last week told reporters only of
the four immediate deaths.
   The Panchen Lama, second only to the exiled Dalai Lama in the
Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy, supports Chinese rule in Tibet and is
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, China's legislature.
   Although his account of events March 5 spoke of fewer
protesters, casualties and arrests than the unofficial Western
accounts, it showed larger scale unrest and a heavier crackdown
than the official media.
   He confirmed that several thousand Tibetans took part in the
protest, compared to earlier official accounts of only ``a few
separatists.''
   The Panchen Lama said more than 200 people were detained during
and after the protest for interrogation, and that most had been
released. He did not give specific figures.
   He said only three were formally charged, although he did not
specify what charges.
   ``They will be sentenced according to their crimes and according
to the law,'' he said, speaking in Tibetan in the Great Hall of the
People.
   The Panchen Lama also said several people were detained on
suspicion of involvement in the slaying of the policeman, who was
beaten and pushed from a window.
   The March 5 protest was the fourth against Chinese rule in Lhasa
in five months. On Oct. 1, thousands of Tibetans led by Buddhist
monks stormed and set fire to a police station in Lhasa. At least
14 people died.
   Smaller groups of monks protested Sept. 26 and Oct. 6.
   The government has said more than 80 people were arrested in
connection with the three earlier protests, and 15 remain jailed.
   All the protests have been led by Tibetan Buddhist monks loyal
to the Dalai Lama, who was both religious and civil ruler in Tibet
before the Chinese Communist takeover in 1950. The Dalai Lama fled
to exile in India in 1959 following a failed anti-Chinese uprising.
   China maintains it has held sovereignty over Tibet since the
13th century. Tibetan independence advocates say the remote
Himalayan region enjoyed de facto independence for most of that
time.
   The Panchen Lama, while upholding China's claim to sovereignty,
has called in recent months for greater regional autonomy and an
end to policies under which religion, the center of Tibetan daily
life, was virtually banned during the 1960s and 1970s.

   On Sapelo Island, one of the least-developed
barrier islands along the Atlantic Coast, residents drive a fleet
of battered old cars with no licenses, tags or insurance _ or
police.
   There's no need for patrolmen because community leaders keep the
peace and resolve disputes; they once banished a man to the
mainland for fighting.
   ``It's kind of a self-disciplining community. They help resolve
their own problems without having a police force,'' said C.V.
Waters, regional supervisor for the state Department of Natural
Resources, which manages the island.
   But the quiet lifestyle that thrives among the stands of oak,
pine and salt marshes may be threatened by a state plan to boost
tourism.
   The resources department plans to buy a 50-passenger tram to
bring tourists from the mainland this summer to see the shabby
remains of an old plantation and learn about the history of the
island and the value of marshes and dunes.
   The department, however, says it will keep visitors away from
Hog Hammock, whose 75 residents live in a cluster of wooden houses
set amid stands of oak, pine and palmettos. Most are descendants of
slaves.
   Sapelo, the fourth-largest of the 12 barrier islands along the
Georgia coast, lies about halfway between South Carolina and
Florida. Ten miles long and nearly three miles wide, its 16,000
acres include 10,600 acres of high ground and 5,400 acres of salt
marsh.
   The state owns the island, except for 434 acres that make up Hog
Hammock. According to legend, Hog Hammock was named for Sampson
Hog, an early resident. A hammock is a piece of elevated ground in
a swampy area.
   The island's 50 other residents either work for the University
of Georgia's Marine Institute, a leader in marine and estuarian
research, or the state resources department.
   Hog Hammock residents prize their simple lifestyle.
   ``It's a beautiful place. It's quiet and peaceful,'' Viola
Johnson said in a recent interview at her back steps, where a group
of stray cats were sunning themselves.
   The average age of island residents is 61, so many are retired.
Most of those who continue to work have island jobs with the
resources department or the university.
   Tourists won't change life on Sapelo Island, said Waters of the
Natural Resources Department.
   ``Most of the time they'll see shore birds, deer and turkey,''
he said.

   Conservationist and author Elliott S.
Barker, who helped make Smokey the Bear part of American lore, has
died. He was 101.
   Barker died Sunday at a Santa Fe nursing home where he had lived
for more than a year.
   Barker, a founding member of the National Wildlife Federation,
was named a ``hero of our time'' in July 1987 by Newsweek magazine.
   In 1950, he sent a bear cub rescued from a fire in the Lincoln
National Forest to Washington to represent the National Forest
Service. Smokey the Bear became a fixture in the National Zoo where
he was a living symbol for forest fire prevention.
   Barker, who was born in 1886 in Moran, Texas, moved with his
family to New Mexico in a covered wagon when he was 3 years old.
   He worked for the U.S. Forest Service in New Mexico for 10 years
as a ranger and a supervisor. In 1931, he was named the state's
first game warden and stayed on the job until retiring 22 years
later.
   Barker joined a group of New Mexicans who lobbied for the
state's first laws to protect game and fish. The state Legislature
adopted a law in 1930.
   During his tenure the state acquired 75,000 acres of land for
recreation and wildlife refuges, established fish hatcheries and
began the reintroduction of several species of animal into New
Mexico.
   After retiring in 1953, Barker began to write full-time. He
wrote seven books and in 1972 received the Golden Spur Award from
the Western Writers of America for his book, ``Western Life and
Adventures, 1889-1970.''
   He is survived by his wife, Ethel; three children, Roy Barker
and Florence Giers, both of Santa Fe, and Dorothy Elmore of El
Paso, Texas; and a sister, Grace Wilson of Aztec.
   Services will be held at St. John's United Methodist Church in
Santa Fe.

   Palestinians mounted a general strike today to
protest the visit of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who was
trying to persuade Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept an
international peace conference.
   Hospital officials said an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot to
death and another 18-year-old was wounded during West Bank unrest
that accompanied the general strike.
   The fatality brought to 137 the number of Arabs who have died in
four months of anti-Israeli protests. One Israeli soldier has been
killed.
   After meeting with Shamir and Foreign Minister Simon Peres,
Shultz told reporters his talks focused on the content of
prospective Arab-Israeli talks rather than the procedure of
arranging a meeting.
   ``The encouraging part about it to me was that we have now
engaged in this initiative on the important aspects of its content,
namely the direct face-to-face negotitions,'' said Shultz.
   Streets in the towns of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
were nearly deserted today and shops shuttered after an underground
PLO leaflet called for a general strike and three days of protests
to coincide with Shultz's visit.
   Hospital officials said Mohammed Abed Maadi Al Zaidan was shot
in the chest and died during a demonstration in Bani Naim, a West
Bank village near Hebron.
   In Nablus, hospital officials said an 18-year-old Palestinian
was wounded in the thigh by army gunfire during a protest at the
Balata refugee camp. The army said a border policeman opened fire
during the protest, wounding an Arab in the leg, after being
attacked with an ax. The camp was placed under curfew.
   About 600 police were deployed in Jerusalem's Old Walled City to
prevent clashes between Moslems and a militant Jewish group that
tried to enter and pray in the Al Aqsa mosque complex.
   The mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines, is built atop the
site of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by Romans in 70 A.D.
   ``The Temple Mount, the national symbol of our people, (is) in
the hands of our enemies,'' read a banner carried by 50 members of
the Jewish group, known as the Temple Mount Faithful. They were
turned back at the entrance ramp by 30 police officers.
   Anwar Khatib, deputy head of the 30-member Islamic Supreme
Council, which administers the Moslem shrines, said if the Jewish
group entered the complex Moslems would be forced to ``defend
themselves.''
   A Hebrew-language leaflet circulating in the West Bank town of
Nablus called on Israeli soldiers to desert.
   Between Jerusalem and the twin cities of Ramallah and El Bireh,
there was virtually no traffic on the roads and the only open store
was a bakery. Bakeries were exempted from the general strike call.
   In the Gaza Strip, cars also stayed off the road today except
for U.N. vehicles and Israeli army trucks and jeeps. Outlawed
Palestinian flags flew from many rooftops and utility poles.
   Rashad Al Shawwa, the deposed mayor of Gaza City, said the city
had joined the strike and said Israeli soldiers had closed gasoline
stations and bakeries and may have turned off electricity.
   ``Electricity has been cut off from the town altogether. We
don't know if this is another punishment,'' Al Shawwa said in a
telephone interview. ``The closing of bakeries will definitely lead
to a (food) shortage.''
   Shultz, in an interview Sunday night with Israeli journalists,
said he intended to reassure Shamir that he would not allow an
international conference to impose terms of a settlement on Israel.
   ``We are going to do things together,'' Shultz said. ``The
conference would have no authority to impose a solution, and would
have no authority to veto an agreement reached by the parties.''
   The PLO rejected the U.S. proposal that calls for talks on some
Palestinian self-rule to start on May 1 and on the overall
settlement in December. In a statement issued in Tunis, the PLO
demanded a role in peace talks.
   The PLO-affiliated underground leadership called in a leaflet
last week for a general strike today to protest the Shultz visit.
   ``Nobody from the Arab world can say, `yes,' if the PLO says,
`no,'' said Faiz Abu Rahmeh, a moderate lawyer from Gaza whose name
has been raised in the past as a potential non-PLO negotiator.
   Three Arabs died Sunday, including one electrocuted when
soldiers ordered him to climb a utility pole and take down a
Palestinian flag, the army said. A spokeswoman said military police
had started an investigation into the death of Khalil Jaber
Hamzawy, 18.

   Only days after some of their fellow
soldiers returned from Honduras, men and women from a combat
aviation brigade prepared to leave for Panama as part of a step-up
in security for Americans there.
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' said pilot Debra Proffitt, a
23-year-old warrant officer. ``I'm a little excited. It'll be a
good experience and good training.''
   Proffitt and about 200 other members of the brigade from the 7th
Light Infantry Division loaded weapons and supplies onto
helicopters to ready for their deployment, starting today, to the
troubled Central American nation.
   The Pentagon says the soldiers, along with 26 helicopters
including seven armed gunships, are being sent to increase security
for Americans and U.S. facilities in Panama, where Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega continues to resist U.S. pressure for him to step
down.
   On Sunday, a Panamanian military vehicle with its siren blaring
chased the car of U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis for two miles in an
incident the U.S. Embassy termed ``serious.''
   About 10,000 troops are stationed at the U.S. Southern Command
in Panama, according to the Pentagon.
   The army has said it does not expect the troops heading south to
enter combat, and the soldiers believe the American people support
their mission, in contrast to the recent Honduran deployment, which
sparked widespread protests.
   ``I think it's very appropriate that public opinion is with
us,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Dodge, commander of the unit dubbed ``Task
Force Hawk.''
   The unit is scheduled to fly today from its base outside
Monterey to Travis Air Force Base, 150 miles to the northeast.
Later, it will join about 1,100 other Army soldiers and Marines who
will arrive in Panama from Tuesday through Friday, although no
arrival date has been disclosed for the Fort Ord group.
   Army spokesman Paul Boyce said the troops are taking all the
types of helicopters they normally fly and train with. He called
the action ``a normal troop movement,'' not an emergency deployment
like the recent Honduran mission.
   Dodge said his pilots, ground crews and air crewmen are armed
and prepared for any of a number of missions they have trained for,
including transporting troops, evacuating civilians and other
military operations.
   ``We normally deploy with what we'd go to war with,'' he said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz reopened
talks today with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir with a pledge the
United States would oppose a Palestinian state and any effort to
force Israel to return to its pre-1967 borders.
   The two-hour meeting at Shamir's office launched Shultz's second
shuttle visit to the Middle East in a month and a new attempt to
hold Arab-Israeli negotiations May 1 to provide some self-rule for
Palestinian Arabs.
   Shamir described the two-hour session as ``a very good and basic
discussion'' of the essential issues.
   Shultz told reporters the two leaders concentrated on the need
for direct negotiations between Israel and the Arabs and ``how they
might be structured.''
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the meeting was held in a
``friendly spirit'' but that differences remained over the
U.S.-proposed international conference and Shultz's meeting last
month with two Arab-American members of the Palestine National
Council, the legislative arm of the PLO.
   Shultz also met today with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who
supports the U.S. initiative. The two leaders told reporters they
had discussed how to achieve face-to-face Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   ``We are not closing our eyes to the obstacles on the road that
leads to direct negotiations, but we feel we can make some progress
on the real issues lying ahead of us,'' Peres said.
   Shultz said he was encouraged because the talks centered on
direct negotiations, adding, ``That's where the emphasis needs to
be, and that's where it has been.''
   Shamir leads the right-wing Likud bloc, while Peres heads the
center-left Labor Party. Their parties are in the third year of a
fragile coalition, and the two leaders traded jobs in October 1987.
   Shultz returned to the region without support from Israel,
Jordan, or Syria, three key parties, on his plan for negotiations
to address an overall Middle East settlement in December, in the
second stage of the talks.
   He emphasized on his arrival Sunday that negotiations would be
based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which calls on
Israel to yield territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war with
Egypt, Jordan and Syria.
   Shultz said the resolution, which also promises Israel security,
applied to ``all fronts.'' The resolution, however, does not
specifically call on Israel to give up all the territory.
   Asked if he agreed with Peres that Israel should not return to
its pre-1967 borders and that there would be no Palestinian state,
Shultz replied: ``Absolutely.''
   A reporter asked again if Shultz was saying ``no'' to a
Palestinian state. Shultz responded: ``No to a Palestinian state,
no to a return to the borders.''
   Israel relinquished the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt as a part of a
1979 peace treaty. But Shamir is reluctant to give up the West
Bank, which Jordan occupied from 1949 until 1967 when Israel
captured the territory in a war.
   Shultz's visit comes after four months of rioting in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that has killed more than 135
Arabs and one Israeli soldier.
   Shamir, in a tour of the West Bank on Sunday, questioned whether
the Arabs were ready to deal with Israel. Shamir said he was
skeptical ``about all the prophecies that the talks will have some
kind of result, a breakthrough.''
   Shultz also will meet with Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
   In Tunis, meanwhile, the PLO reaffirmed its rejection of the
U.S. plan.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee
issued a statement Sunday saying the Palestinian people were
unanimous ``to thwart the dangerous American plan.''
   ``The just and global solution must be based on the achievement
of the national right of the Palestinian people, under the
direction of the PLO, its sole legitimate representative,'' the
statement said.
   The PLO-affiliated leadership of the Palestinian uprising called
for a three-day strike beginning today on the West Bank and in
Gaza, and barred Palestinians from meeting Shultz during his
five-day trip to the region. The strike closed stores throughout
the territories today.
   In the television interview on Sunday, Shultz defended his
meeting last Saturday in Washington with Edward Said and Ibrahim
Abu-Lughud, two American professors who are members of the
Palestinian National Council.
   ``They are not members of the PLO,'' Shultz said. The council is
the legislative arm of the PLO movement to establish a state on
Israeli territory.
   Shultz described the two council members as Americans who are
ethnic Palestinians and whose ``aspirations'' deserve a U.S.
hearing.
   Shultz is looking on this trip for a positive reply to the
two-step plan for negotiations he presented a month ago to Arab and
Israeli leaders.

<HEAD>India Confirms It Paid Money to Tamil Rebel Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indian government paid Sri Lanka's
top Tamil separatist leader to ensure his cooperation in an accord
intended to end the rebels' war against the dominant Sinhalese, the
Indian ambassador said today.
   Ambassador J.N. Dixit said said Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, requested the money at
meetings in New Delhi last July.
   Prabhakaran said the money would make up for ``taxes'' that had
been paid to the militia by people in Jaffna, the Tigers' main
stronghold in northern Sri Lanka, Dixit reported.
   ``India agreed to it and some money was paid,'' said Dixit.
   The Tigers since then have rejected the peace accord, signed by
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and President Junius R.
Jayewardene of Sri Lanka last July 29.
   Indian forces sent to enforce the accord have been fighting the
Tamil rebel militia in the island nation since last October. More
than 400 Indian soldiers and more than 1,000 militiamen have been
reported killed.
   The Indian Post newspaper reported the payments on Sunday, and
Dixit confirmed the story. He said he did not know the amount but
added, ``Enough money was given him to take care of his requests at
that point in time.''
   The Post quoted an unidentified Tiger spokesman as saying the
agreement with India was for $384,600 a month but that no payment
was made after the first month, when the Tigers already were
criticizing the peace accord.
   Gandhi signed the accord after trying for nearly three years to
mediate a peace settlement between the Tamils and the government.
   Dixit said Prabhakaran and Gandhi met in New Delhi before the
signing of the accord. Dixit said Prabhakaran then asked for the
money and for allowing his men to keep some arms to ensure his
security.
   The Tigers did not sign the accord but agreed to give up almost
all their arms. The accord calls for disarming the rebels in
exchange for Sri Lanka granting more autonomy to Tamils.
   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate Tamil
nation in Sri Lanka's north and east. Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the island's 16 million population, say they suffer
discrimination from the Sinhalese, who control the government.
   Most Tamils are Hindu and most Sinhalese are Buddhists. India, a
majority Hindu nation, became involved at the request of its own
large Tamil minority.

   State police today expanded into Ohio
and Pennsylvania a manhunt for three convicted murderers who
escaped from the maximum-security West Virginia Penitentiary.
   The three inmates were serving life sentences without
possibility for parole and were housed separately in cells in the
same prison wing, said Jerrie Clutter, secretary to Warden Jerry
Hedrick. Two of them had records of escape attempts.
   The inmates were noticed missing during a 10:15 p.m. Sunday cell
check, Clutter said. They were still at large at mid-morning.
   A heavy rain hampered the search effort as state police in West
Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as Marshall County
Sheriff's deputies and local authorities, combed the rural northern
West Virginia countryside for the inmates, Clutter said.
   But authorities this morning started lifting some of the
roadblocks set up throughout Marshall and neighboring counties,
including on bridges over the Ohio River just west of the prison,
and on roads into Pennsylvania, which borders the county to the
east, she said.
   One of the inmates was believed spotted in Yorkville, Ohio,
about 20 miles north of the prison, Clutter said.
   The men apparently slipped out through an unused portion of the
aging prison, said West Virginia Corrections Commissioner A.V.
Dodrill.
   Prison clothing was found in the building, and the outside gate
in front of the wing was cut open, Clutter said.
   ``The old administration building has been closed several years.
We don't use that building, and they somehow got into there, we're
not sure exactly how,'' Dodrill said.
   ``It obviously was well-planned. Therefore we have got to assume
plans were also made for the outside once they got out,'' he said.
   The prison was locked down following the escape, said Deputy
Corrections Commissioner Bill Whyte.
   ``The prisoners are being retained in their cells until such
time as the warden is comfortable that there are no other inmates
involved assisting these prisoners in their escape,'' he said.
   The escapees were identified as Bobby Stacy, 35, David Williams,
28, and Tommie Mollohan, 45, Clutter said. They were considered
dangerous, but were not known to be carrying weapons, Clutter said.
   Stacy, formerly of Columbus, Ohio, was convicted in 1982 for the
murder of Huntington Police Officer Paul Harmon, who was shot five
times with his own service revolver. At the time of the killing,
Stacy was on bond after being charged with shooting a Huber
Heights, Ohio, police officer with a sawed-off shotgun.
   Stacy once vowed to kill a Cabell County Circuit Judge and
prosecutor who handled his case, Huntington police Lt. Joe Walker
said
   Following the escape, a guard was posted at the home of a
Columbus woman who testified against Stacy, police there said.
   Mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a Brounland
grocer in 1973. Mollohan at the time had escaped from a Florida
prison and also was wanted in Georgia and North Carolina on armed
robbery charges.
   Williams was convicted of the December 1980 murder of a Marytown
resident, found bludgeoned to death in his burned home. He was
caught trying to scale a prison wall at Moundsville in 1983 after
learning that his mother was seriously ill.
   The massive, stone block penitentiary houses maximum security
inmates and was the site of a bloody New Years' Day 1986 riot in
which three inmates were killed.

<HEAD>Nixon Calls Jackson Best Candidate, But Says He Can't Win</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon says that
Jesse Jackson is the best candidate seeking a presidential
nomination but that he could not win because of his radical views.
   The Washington Times reported Nixon's comments in today's
editions from an exclusive interview this weekend at the former
president's home in Saddle River, N.J., with the newspaper's
executive editor, Arnaud de Borchgrave.
   ``He's the best candidate and one of the very best of the entire
century for either party,'' Nixon was quoted as saying.
   ``Jackson's problem is not the messenger, it's the message. ...
He's expressing a deep-felt radicalism, or liberalism, whatever you
want to call it, which may be a majority in some areas but is a
minority in the country as a whole,'' Nixon said.
   ``And if he is nominated, it goes without saying he cannot win.
But everyone is overplaying the fact that he would be a liability
because he is black,'' Nixon said. ``That is simply not true.
Jackson would be a liability because his views are radical.''
   He said Jackson ``is the only interesting candidate in the race,
either Republican or Democrat'' and that, regardless of what
happens, ``Jackson has established himself as a force to be
reckoned with in his party and in this country. ... I disagree with
Jesse Jackson, but I respect him. Brilliant campaigner.''
   But Nixon said Jackson ``would have to think long and hard
before he would even consider to be No. 2 because even though the
Democrats are probably going to lose anyway, he would certainly be
blamed because he was black.''
   Nixon, who resigned in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate
scandal, also discussed foreign policy extensively with the Times
editor.
   Nixon recommended that the next president ``draft'' former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who also served as his
assistant for national security affairs, as a Mideast peacemaker
with a mandate to find a solution to the problems in the region
within one year.
   Kissinger should talk with Palestine Liberation Organization
chief Yasser Arafat, Nixon said. ``You can't make a deal with him,
nor can you make one without him,'' he added.
   Nixon also said ``everyone should quit being taken in by this
line that (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev has changed Soviet
goals. He has done no such thing.''
   He cited a speech given by Gorbachev last October for the 70th
anniversary of the communist revolution as proof that the Soviet
leader still has the goal of Marxist world domination. He quoted
Gorbachev as saying, ``Seventy years ago, we parted with the old
world, rejecting it once and for all. We are moving toward a new
world, the world of communism. We will never turn off that road.''
   On the subject of Nicaragua, the former president said the
United States should ``quarantine'' the central American nation if
Soviet aid to the Sandinistas does not end and the regime continues
to pose a threat to Central America.

<HEAD>Mother Sets House Fire That Kills Self, Two Daughters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese mother and her two young
daughters died in a house fire the woman apparently set because she
was distressed by marital problems, police said.
   The body of Mitsue Sakai, 28, was found early Sunday in a
bedroom along with those of her daughters, Seira Candy Sakai, 5,
and Rina Stephanie Sakai, 4.
   The three are believed to have died from smoke inhalation from
the fire, which was set in the living room, Sgt. Larry Kurtz said.
   ``Based on physical evidence found at the scene and interviews
with witnesses, it is believed the suspect (Mrs. Sakai)
intentionally set fire to the house. She was extremely distraught
over marital and family problems,'' Kurtz said.
   Some friends of the family speculated that the apparent
murder-suicide may be a case of ``oyaku shinju,'' a Japanese
tradition in which parents planning suicide believe they also must
kill their children so they will not be orphans.
   Mrs. Sakai, who moved to the United States from Japan about
eight years ago, and her husband, Hideo, were described by
acquaintances as quiet and hard-working people.
   ``With her husband, they were like ships in the night,'' said
neighbor Barry Rivard. ``They'd kind of pass.''
   Mrs. Sakai worked at the Mitsuyoshi Japanese restaurant in
Anaheim, and her husband is head chef at the Amagi Japanese
restaurant in Buena Park.
   Yoshikazu Suzuki, owner of the Amagi restaurant, said the couple
had met at his restaurant about seven years ago when Mitsue worked
there as a waitress.
   She worked until 10:30 p.m. and Sakai arrived at the home about
2:30 a.m. and was questioned by police, neighbors said.
   ``If she lost hope or something, she cannot let the children
live,'' Suzuki said. ``I know of many cases in Japan like that.''
   An estimated 300 cases of oyako shinju are reported each year in
Japan, authorities said. Although the practice is illegal in Japan,
it's considered an honorable way to die and lingers in the culture,
according to Mamoru Iga, a professor of sociology at California
State University, Northridge.
   The tragedy recalls the case of Fumiko Kimura, a Japanese-born
woman whose two young children died after she walked into the sea
with them at Santa Monica beach in 1985. Her mother-child suicide
attempt was carried out in shame over her husband's adultery. Mrs.
Kimura pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was placed on
five years' probation.

<HEAD>Shipbuilders Reject New BIW Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the 5,500-member
shipbuilders' union at Bath Iron Works said the workers should not
have rejected the shipyard's proposed three-year contract.
   ``It should have gone through because I don't feel they're going
to offer any more in August,'' said Ray Ladd, president of Local 6
of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of
America.
   Before the contract vote, the company opened its financial
records to accountants hired by the union, a move Ladd hailed as
``a major breakthrough.''
   The proposal, which offered three annual 2.5 percent wage
increases and the phaseout of a two-tier pay system that gives less
money to new employees, was rejected Saturday by a margin of
roughly 3-2, Ladd said.
   However, the union's existing contract doesn't expire until Aug.
14, leaving time for renewed negotiations this summer.
   BIW, Maine's largest private employer, had invited its unions to
open contract talks early this year in hopes of improving its
ability to compete for new shipbuilding contracts.
   The shipyard lost four of five Navy cruiser contracts in
February to rival Ingalls Shipbuilding of Mississippi.
   Duane D. Fitzgerald, BIW's executive vice president, issued a
statement after the contract vote saying management officials were
``disappointed with the result but believe the process was
constructive and informative.''
   ``We do not regret having made the effort,'' Fitzgerald said.
   Ladd blamed the rejection in part on members' desire for bigger
pay hikes and a swifter end to the two-tier wage system.
   Under the current contract for Local 6, new employees have been
paid about $3 less an hour than veteran workers. The rejected
proposal would have phased out the two-tier system in April 1990.
   Local 7, representing 393 clerical and technical workers,
overwhelmingly approved a new three-year contract a week ago.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Block FTC Investigations in Massachusetts Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to block the
Federal Trade Commission from investigating allegedly
anti-competitive practices of state agencies that license and
regulate professionals.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that FTC
investigators may subpoena members of a Massachusetts board that
regulates pharmacies in the state.
   Officials from 19 states joined Massachusetts in urging the
court to limit the FTC's power. The state officials said the
commission is interfering improperly with their authority.
   The commission in 1985 launched its investigation of the
Massachusetts Pharmacy Registration Board.
   The board consists of six pharmacists and a public member
appointed to five-year terms by the governor.
   Federal investigators are questioning whether three of the
board's rules restrain competition illegally.
   One rule bans advertising claims of professional superiority; a
second prohibits mail-order business by druggists; and a third
forbids so-called ``pick-up stations'' that permit customers to
pick up prescriptions at branch outlets.
   The commission sought to subpoena pharmacy board members to
determine whether the rules unreasonably restrict advertising and
customer convenience.
   A federal judge ruled that the commission has the power to
question the board members, and the decision was upheld by the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court rejected arguments by Massachusetts officials
that the pharmacy board is carrying out state policy and thus is
exempt from antitrust attack. The appeals court raised the
possibility that a board composed almost entirely of pharmacists
might be imposing private restraints rather than carrying out
public policy.
   The Reagan administration supported the appeals court ruling.
Justice Department lawyers said the subpoenas should be enforced to
determine whether there is a legitimate state claim to antitrust
immunity.
   But officials from Massachusetts and 19 other states said it is
a case of improper federal intrusion potentially affecting
regulation by hundreds of state boards.
   ``As governments exercising traditional regulatory powers to
protect the public health and safety, the states are uniquely
qualified to testify to the importance of the question presented
... in this case,'' state officials said in urging reversal of the
appeals court ruling.
   The states supporting Massachusetts' appeal are Alabama,
Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee and West
Virginia.
   The case is Monahan vs. FTC, 87-1015.

   Milton A. Caniff, the comic strip artist who
pitted square-jawed Americans against treacherous dragon ladies in
``Terry and the Pirates'' and ``Steve Canyon,'' died Sunday at age
81.
   He began his career drawing ``Dickie Dare'' and ``The Gay
Thirties'' for The Associated Press. But it was with ``Terry and
the Pirates,'' which he started in 1934 for the New York Daily
News, that he made his mark on adventure cartooning.
   By 1946, Caniff was making $75,000 per year and ``Terry and the
Pirates'' was in more than 300 newspapers.
   However, Caniff was unhappy that he did not own the strip and
was lured away by Marshall Field and the Chicago Sun Syndicate,
which paid him $2,000 a week and ownership of his new hero, ``Steve
Canyon.''
   ``Steve Canyon'' was in more than 500 newspapers around the
world as of early this year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether New York City's powerful Board of Estimate must be
reapportioned to meet equal-voting standards.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by city officials who said
applying the one-person, one-vote rule to the governing body will
undermine its ability to balance regional and local interests.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October said city
officials should set a one-year deadline for revamping the board to
comply with the principle of balanced representation. The appeals
court urged the city to come up with a plan within six months.
   The board was allowed to function with its current composition
in the interim.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch has named a commission to propose changes
in the city charter. Those changes will be put to the voters in a
binding referendum in November.
   The Board of Estimate is composed of the mayor, the city council
president and the city comptroller. Each city-wide official has two
votes on the board.
   In addition, the presidents of the city's five boroughs are
members of the board with one vote apiece.
   The city's population is more than 7 million, with wide
disparities in the size of the boroughs.
   Brooklyn's population is about 2.2 million, Queens 1.9 million,
Manhattan 1.4 million, the Bronx 1.2 million and Staten Island,
350,000.
   The board's responsibilities include determining the use,
development and improvement of city property, negotiating city
contracts, awarding franchises and leasing property, setting water
and sewer rates, zoning decisions and tax abatements.
   An example of the board's power cited by the 2nd Circuit court
is determining whether and where a toxic waste dump can be located
in the city. Other examples range from deciding where skyscrapers
are built and awarding cable television franchises to granting
permits to sidewalk cafes.
   The board also may make changes in the city budget with the
consent of the city council.
   The composition of the board was challenged by three Brooklyn
residents who said their borough is underrepresented. They filed a
lawsuit in 1981 that said the board's make-up violated their
constitutional right to equal representation.
   Richard D. Emery, a lawyer representing them, said the board is
``a vestige of a system of power in New York that benefited the
moneyed interests, the real estate interests.''
   But city officials said the board should be exempt from the
one-person, one-vote standard because it is ``an innovative form of
regional government exercising local powers.''
   They said there is no evidence the board is ``unresponsive to
the popular will or the hostage of a narrow minority of the city's
populace.'' There is ``no evidence of arbitrary whim, or of
gerrymander or of racial mischief'' in the composition, the
officials added.
   They also said most key decisions of the board are reached
through consensus, and that revamping the composition will
undermine home rule.
   But the 2nd Circuit court said the principle of voting
apportionment based on population equality applies to local
elections _ including those for members of the board.
   The current board members beside Koch are city Controller
Harrison J. Goldin, Council President Andrew J. Stein, and borough
presidents Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, David Dinkins of
Manhattan, Claire Shulman of Queens, Howard Golden of Brooklyn and
Ralph J. Lamberti of Staten Island.
   The case is Board of Estimate vs. Morris, 87-1022.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Alaska Natives on Bird-Hunting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
Alaska natives who want to hunt migratory birds in the spring and
summer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that treaties
between the United States and other nations generally ban the
hunting between March 10 and Sept. 1.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October ruled in
favor of conservationists who challenged the right of the Alaska
natives to kill migratory waterfowl for food during the offseason.
   The appeals court said the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of
1918 limits hunting of the birds to those periods approved in
related treaties between the United States and other nations.
   The government has entered treaties with Canada, Mexico, Japan
and the Soviet Union.
   The Canada treaty imposes the strictest limits, essentially
permitting hunting only from Sept. 1 to Dec. 15.
   The Alaska natives, particularly Eskimos living near the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, say the birds are an important part of their
diet.
   A sharp decline in the population of Cackling Canada Geese,
White Fronted Geese, Pacific Black Brant and Emperor Geese has
caused conservationists to be concerned about their survival.
   The birds nest and raise their young in the delta during the
spring and summer months and then migrate south in early September.
   The Alaska natives said a 1925 federal law authorizes them to
hunt the birds when needed for food, superseding the earlier
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   But the 9th Circuit court said the earlier law still governs the
hunting season. Generally, the season may be extended only if
treaties related to the act are amended to relax the restrictions,
the appeals court said.
   However, the appeals court stopped short of banning all
off-season hunting of the waterfowl. Instead, it ordered a federal
judge to conduct further study to determine whether agreements
between the Alaska natives and the U.S. Wildlife Service violate
the treaty act.
   The most recent agreement, called the 1985 Goose Management
Plan, limits hunting of the birds for food but does not prohibit it
entirely.
   The Reagan administration supported the 9th Circuit court ruling.
   The appeal acted on today was filed by lawyers for the Alaska
natives.
   The case is Alaska Federation of Natives vs. Alaska Fish and
Wildlife Federation, 87-1157.

   Mormon Church leaders say followers should
examine their lives and consider whether they are following the
basic tenets of their faith.
   The challenge to renew their dedication to the teachings of
Jesus was issued to members Sunday at the close of the 158th Annual
General Session of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   ``While we still feel the spirit of this great conference and
the words ring in our ears, let us determine how each of us can be
doers of the word and not hearers only,'' said church President
Ezra Taft Benson in a sermon that was read by an associate.
   Benson, 88, attended the conference's closing session, but asked
Gordon B. Hinckley, a counselor in the governing First Presidency,
to read the sermon.
   Benson, who suffered a heart attack last year and delivered two
addresses on Saturday, said he was too tired to speak Sunday, a
church spokesman said.
   With the closing day falling on Easter Sunday, sermons focused
on the divinity of Jesus Christ and the promise that his
resurrection and atonement offer eternal life to all who accept him
and adhere to the church's teachings.
   Mormons believe that theirs is the one true church, and that
church leaders receive revelations from Jesus. In his sermon,
Benson said conference messages are as important as scripture
because they contain communications from God.
   More than 6,000 church members attended the proceedings in the
Tabernacle on Temple Square, and thousands more watched by live
satellite transmission in nearly 2,000 meetinghouses throughout the
United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.
   The church was founded by Joseph Smith, a 19th century religious
figure who said he found gold plates near Palmyra, N.Y., that
described a visit to America by Jesus after the crucifixion and
contained the true word of God. He wrote what he said was a
translation of the plates, which were returned to the heavenly
messenger who led Smith to them.
   On Saturday, leaders announced that a record 227,284 converts
joined the church during 1987, bringing total membership to 6.5
million.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge Challenge to New York City's Rent Control
Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   `a substantial federal
question,'' refused to hear arguments that the law ``confiscates''
landlords' property by limiting yearly rent increases for
apartments to 7.5 percent.
   The law, covering buildings constructed before 1947, was
challenged by owners of Manhattan apartment buildings converted to
cooperatives in the early 1970s.
   Tenants in the buildings who chose not to buy their apartments
were allowed by law to remain as renters, and have been subject to
annual rent increases of 7.5 percent since then.
   The landlords said the increases limit their rate of return on
the property to approximately 1 or 2 percent even though real
estate values in New York City have skyrocketed.
   A rate of return of about 2 percent is ``so unreasonably low''
that it ``amounted to confiscation'' of the property, the landlords
said.
   ``It is simply unfair and unconstitutional to select a
particular class of property owners and force them to donate their
property to a public purpose and make them finance a public benefit
that should be the responsibility of the entire population,'' the
landords' lawyers said.
   Their appeal also said the rent controls are in conflict with
another provision of New York City law aimed at giving landlords an
8.5 percent return on their property.
   The long-term effect of the rent controls will be to discourage
new investment in rental housing and cause deterioration of
apartment buildings, the appeal contended.
   The New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal
defended the rent controls.
   State officials said the law balances ``the interest of
landlords while preventing precipitous rent hikes in order to
prevent uncertainty, hardship and dislocation to tenants.''
   The challenge to the New York City law was dismissed in 1987 by
a state appeals court in a three-paragraph ruling.
   The nation's highest court last Feb. 24 upheld a rent control
ordinance in San Jose, Calif., that was attacked as violating the
constitutional rights of landlords. The San Jose law permits
officials to consider a tenant's financial hardship in deciding
whether to grant rent increases.
   The case is Greene vs. Mirabel, 87-1212.

   Democrats and Republicans on a House committee
are calling for more federal spending on mental health services to
improve a piecemeal system they say isn't meeting the needs of
patients or those trying to help them.
   ``Drastic cuts in staff and funding have crippled ... efforts to
address the problems that states and communities have in serving
the mentally ill,'' concludes a report adopted by all members of
the Government Operations Committee.
   The report cites a 30 percent drop in grant money for community
services and an 88 percent staff cut in a federal division that
provides technical help to states and localities. It says both
spending and staff levels must be restored to pre-1981 status or
higher.
   The release of the report Sunday marks ``the first time that a
very diverse bipartisan congressional panel has issued such a
critical report on the federal role in providing mental health
services,'' said Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the
subcommittee that did the investigation.
   According to the report, the government is spending $73 billion
a year on mental health services, but they are often fragmented,
inappropriate, ineffective or simply lacking.
   In addition, it said, 75 percent of services to the mentally ill
are provided in communities, but outpatient and community services
receive only 30 percent of the federal money spent in the area.
   Nearly 29 million Americans are victims of some form of mental
illness that requires professional treatment. Since the 1960s the
trend has been to treat patients in community rather than
institutional settings, but the report cited ``a desperate lack of
community services'' for the most severely mentally ill.
   The federal government, through the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Administration, was spending $606 million for
community mental health services in 1980, the committee report
said. The amount decreased 14 percent to $519.4 million the next
year and another 18 percent to $428.1 million in 1982.
   By this year the amount had risen to $643 million, but still 30
percent below the 1980 level when inflation is taken into account,
the committee report said.
   The National Institute of Mental Health runs a community support
program designed to encourage the provision of housing, job
training, social services and treatment for the mentally ill. The
program has won wide praise but is severely underfunded, the
committee said.
   Social Security disability insurance, Supplemental Security
Income, Medicaid and Medicare provide living and treatment funds to
the mentally ill, but the report said some victims are unable to
cope with the complex application process. In Ohio, for example,
only 12 percent of those eligible for the first two programs
receive the benefits, it said.
   An 88 percent staff cut occurred at the NIMH division of
education and service system liaison, which provides technical
assistance to states and localities.
   The report said 290 people were working at the main office and
regional offices in 1980, but the Office of Management and Budget
ordered all regional offices closed and only 35 people remain at
the main office.
   Administration witnesses at a hearing last year defended the
staff and funding cuts, the committee report said, but the acting
NIMH director conceded that ``certainly additional resources might
enrich what we're doing.''
   Committee Republicans acknowledged in an addendum to the report
that many of the problems it identified stem from a shortage of
federal dollars.
   ``We do not dispute the fact that additional financial resources
would enable states and local communities to assist more mentally
ill individuals,'' the GOP members said. They said that in light of
restrictions on federal spending, new money should be spent in
high-priority areas such as treatment of the severely mentally ill,
young adults and the elderly.

<HEAD>Photographer Ordered to Not Display `Boudoir' Photos of
Chancellor's Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a photographer to
stop showing potential customers ``boudoir'' photos that a college
chancellor's wife had made as a sexy Christmas gift for her husband.
   The order issued Friday put an end to photographer Ray
Westbrook's use of the photographs of Tricia Kellerman, one a
semi-nude picture, in a display in his studio's ``boudoir'' sample
album.
   Mrs. Kellerman, wife of James Kellerman, chancellor of the North
Orange County Community College District, learned last month from
the wife of a college district employee that someone had seen the
pictures.
   Kellerman went to the studio that same day and pulled the
photographs out of the sample book. Westbrook called the police and
accused Kellerman of stealing the pictures. The police dropped the
case but the Kellermans didn't.
   They filed a lawsuit claiming their privacy had been violated.
   ``These photographs have cost me far more than money. ... I have
never felt so embarrassed and humiliated,'' Mrs. Kellerman said in
a sworn statement filed in Orange County Superior Court. ``I have
been on an emotional roller coaster.''
   Westbrook countered in his defense Thursday that he had a
witness who could say that Mrs. Kellerman had given him verbal
permission to display the pictures. The photographer said it was
necessary to display such pictures in order to get work.
   He also said he would have destroyed the photos if the
Kellermans had called him to convey their concern.
   Westbrook said Friday he had cut up the disputed pictures and
given them to his attorney. ``They basically don't exist,'' he said.

<HEAD>Heidnik Faces Trial on Murder, Torture Charges</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Peruto said ...,' with 3 grafs to UPDATE with

<TEXT>
   The defense attorney in a bizarre case of
manacled women, murder and dismemberment says he wants a jury from
rural Pennsylvania to hear the case because of the widespread
publicity surrounding it.
   Gary Heidnik is charged with keeping four women chained to a
sewer pipe in a basement torture chamber and killing two others.
   ``I want a jury from a less urban county. Somebody in the
Poconos would know less (about the case) than somebody in
Pittsburgh,'' said A. Charles Peruto Jr., Heidnik's attorney.
   Peruto's first motion after the assignment of Judge Lynn Abraham
to the case this morning was for the out-of-town jury.
   ``I don't think there is a Philadelphian around who doesn't know
the case and want him'' sentenced to death, the attorney said.
   That motion and others are expected to take up the rest of the
week, Peruto said as he and the prosecuting attorneys headed for
Abraham's chambers for the first conference on pending requests.
   Heidnik was arrested shortly after a woman, who said she had
been held in his basement, led police to his north Philadelphia
house. Three half-naked, starved women were found chained there in
the pre-dawn hours of March 25, 1987.
   The limbs of another were found packaged in the kitchen freezer
and the body of a second woman, whom police say Heidnik killed, was
found in a southern New Jersey forest later that day.
   The woman who led police to the house testified at Heidnik's
preliminary hearing that one victim died while hanging by an arm
from the basement ceiling. Police say Heidnik then dismembered her
body in a bathtub.
   The other victim died when Heidnik touched her manacles with
electrical wires while she stood in water, the woman testified.
   Peruto said he will argue his client was insane.
   ``Schizophrenia in its simplest form represents dual
personality. ... It's a classic case of Jekyll and Heidnik,'' he
said.
   Peruto said he has documents that will prove Heidnik was the
subject of LSD tests by the U.S. Army in the early 1960s. The
tests, he said, aggravated his client's schizophrenia.
   The Pentagon has acknowledged performing chemical research with
LSD on 741 volunteers from 1955 to 1967. In a 1981 report, the
Pentagon said most soldiers suffered no significant damage as a
result.
   Peruto declined to say whether Heidnik would take the stand.

<HEAD>Tornadoes Touch Down In Michigan While Louisiana Mops Up</HEAD>

   Thunderstorms spawned at least four tornadoes in Michigan,
causing no injuries but damaging dozens of homes and disrupting
electrical service, while Louisiana residents cleaned up from a
weekend twister and flooding.
   Much of the damage in Michigan was confined to Washtenaw County
southwest of Detroit, where a funnel cloud touched down four times
Sunday afternoon along a 13-mile path, said Dan Harsh, the county
emergency management director.
   The National Weather Service confirmed three other tornadoes in
southeast Michigan, meteorologist Tom Fendon said.
   More than two dozen homes and several barns were damaged by the
four twisters, along with trees and utility poles, officials said.
   A funnel cloud and golfball-size hail were reported late Sunday
afternoon in the Washtenaw County community of Manchester, but the
twister apparently did not touch down, Fendon said.
   The storm system also produced severe thunderstorms elsewhere in
the state's Lower Peninsula. Traverse City, Houghton Lake and Grand
Rapids each received about 1 inch of rain, while wind gusts reached
63 mph near Ann Arbor, the weather service said.
   About 9,000 customers lost electrical service during the storm,
utility officials said.
   Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Dan Vecchioni said only about 400
customers remained without power today, and service to them was
expected to be restored by evening.
   In Louisiana, partly cloudy skies and 80-degree weather
permitted a continued cleanup Sunday by victims of a tornado and
floods that accompanied a torrential weekend rain.
   Southeast Louisiana was waterlogged by more than a foot of
precipitation. Rain-swollen rivers and streams continued to crest
above flood stage, but officials said the flooding would be
confined mostly to rural areas.
   Hardest hit by flooding were the suburban subdivisions in
Marrero, across from New Orleans on the west bank of the
Mississippi River.
   But Tony Rodi, coordinator for emergency management in Jefferson
Parish, said streets hip-deep in water on Saturday were dry by
Sunday, and power was restored to nearly all the houses.
   Rodi said no official count was available on the number of homes
that were flooded Saturday. The Red Cross said about 200 people
were evacuated Saturday; about 70 were in an emergency shelter
Sunday.
   On the other side of Lake Pontchartrain, residents in Slidell
continued to clean up from a tornado Saturday that the state Office
of Emergency Preparedness said destroyed three homes, caused major
damage to 17 others and minor damage to 32 more.

   Small plane crashes in California and Colorado left nine people
dead over the weekend, while two died when a glider slammed into a
mountain.
   A single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza crashed in flames after
taking off Sunday from the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport,
narrowly missing homes in the area, officials said.
   The crash killed three members of a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, family
returning from a ski trip, as well as an 18-year-old family friend.
   Andrew Richard Andrews, 20, emerged from the wreckage in flames,
unaware that his parents and the classmate were dead. He was
critically burned and later died.
   ``He never lost consciousness,'' said paramedic Faye McElroy.
``He said, `What happened?' I said, `You were in a plane crash.' He
said, `Oh, my God, my family.'''
   Andrews remained conscious until after he arrived at the burn
treatment center at Penrose Hospital, but he died at 12:35 a.m.
today, nursing supervisor Lee Shreffler said.
   ``I put him out. He was totally on fire,'' said Russell Shaw, 20.
   ``I told him to roll on the pavement and that didn't work. I
told him to roll in the grass and that didn't work,'' Shaw said.
``I put him out with my shirt. He told us there were three others
in the plane.''
   Also killed were the young man's father, Merle Robert Andrews,
49, the plane's pilot; his mother, Roberta Ann, 48; and Jamie
Harter, 18, all of Cedar Rapids, said El Paso County Deputy Coroner
Michael Stewart.
   West of Boulder, Colo., authorities on Sunday found the bodies
of two people who died Saturday when a glider crashed into the
mountains. The wreckage was found some distance away, authorities
said. The two were identified as James Lesley Clayton, 30, of
Boulder, the pilot; and Loren M. Swisher, 40, of Green River, Wyo.
   In Orinda, Calif., four people died Sunday after a twin-engine
Piper Navajo slammed into a hillside about 15 miles east of San
Francisco. There were no survivors, police chief John Dasher said.
The victims' names were withheld.
   In Calpella, Calif., about 120 miles north of San Francisco, the
pilot of a single-engine Piper died Sunday when the aircraft
crashed in a Mendocino County vineyard after takeoff. The victim,
who was alone, was not immediately identified, said sheriff's Lt.
James Tuso, the chief deputy coroner.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Protestant
marchers waving British flags marched across Northern Ireland today
to commemorate Protestant resistance to the 1689 siege of
Londonderry ordered by Catholic King James II.
   The marches, of which there were at least six, were peaceful, as
were the dozen marches by Roman Catholics on Sunday commemorating
the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in what is now the
Irish Republic.
   The largest Protestant march took place in Banbridge, about 25
miles south of Belfast, where about 40 fife-and-drum bands and 60
local clubs of the Apprentice Boys of Derry paraded.
   The marchers _ some wearing bowler hats, pin-striped suits and
carrying furled umbrellas, others sporting the red, white and blue
of the British flag _ filled the normally quiet streets with a
mixture of British marching songs and old favorites like ``Waltzing
Matilda'' and ``Johnny Comes Marching Home.''
   Smaller parades were held in Belfast, Rathfriland, Gilford,
Dromara and Castlederg.
   The fiercely pro-British Apprentice Boys order takes its name
from 12 apprentices who are said to have slammed Londonderry's
gates on King James' army at the start of the unsuccessful 105-day
siege.
   During the main address of the Banbridge parade, the Rev. Hugh
Ross denounced the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement giving the Irish
Republic a consultative role in the affairs of Northern Ireland. He
called for the independence of the province from both Britain and
the republic.
   ``We must take the initiative and support a policy that will
establish Ulster as a free independent state ... which will forever
reject a united Ireland,'' the Presbyterian minister said.
   On Sunday, the Irish Republican Army dashed any hopes of a
cease-fire, vowing to continue guerrilla attacks on British
security forces until it ``saps the political will of the British
government.'' The IRA statement was read aloud in Belfast at
Milltown Cemetery.
   Austin Currie, a prominent leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, expressed hope Sunday that talks between his moderate
Catholic party and Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed IRA, would lead to ``a permanent end of military and
violent activity.''
   In an Irish Radio interview, Currie said draft documents were
exchanged at the March 23 Sinn Fein-Social Democratic and Labor
Party meeting which could lead to a round-table conference that
would also include Protestant parties and the Irish government.
   But Martin McGuinness, vice president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
legal political arm, told a 5,000-strong crowd at Milltown Cemetery
that cease-fires weren't even discussed at the talks.
   ``The IRA position on cease-fires has been on record for a long
time: No more cease-fires,'' he said, ``talk (can) take place but
the war will go on.''
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told 1,500 people at a march in
Londonderry that the talks with the Social Democratic and Labor
Party ``are about exploring whether there can be an agreement in
principle to an overall strategy for justice and peace.''
   However, he said the two parties were far apart.
   Adams and McGuinness said they strongly opposed any solution to
the nearly 20 years of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland based
on self-government for the province. The only solution, they
insisted, is for Britain to pull out of the province, where
Protestants outnumber Catholics by 3-to-2.
   If Britain refuses to leave, the IRA statement read by
McGuinness said, it will have ``a price to pay ... a price so
overwhelming as to force them to withdraw and leave us in
peace....''
   The IRA said it had a message for the British government:
   ``We will demoralize you. We will make your six counties (of
Northern Ireland) into a millstone which will strangle you.
   ``We will eventually defeat you. Our strategy is clear. It is to
sap the political will of the British government and British people
to remain in Ireland. The means are by limited guerrilla warfare
against crown forces.''
   In the Creggan area of Londonderry, security forces on Sunday
defused a bomb that the IRA said in a statement to Belfast media it
planted but decided not to detonate when an army patrol passed
because children were in the area.
   There was a heavy police and army presence at all the marches as
security forces abandoned their short-lived policy of staying away
from events attended by IRA sympathizers.
   The Sinn Fein march through west Belfast was led and tailed by
armored police Land Rovers with soldiers riding shotgun, their
rifles cocked. Police followed the marchers into Milltown Cemetery
and encircled them, with a number of soldiers hiding behind
tombstones.
   The Milltown ceremony took place 25 yards from the spot where a
Protestant extremist killed three people at an unpoliced IRA
funeral on March 16.
   The no-policing policy ended after two British soldiers who
drove into an IRA funeral on March 19 were dragged from their car
and killed by the IRA.

   Lightning damaged the Sunshine
Skyway Bridge's motorist warning system just days before it was to
begin operating, a state transportation official said.
   The $2.2 million network of blinking lights and flashing message
boards is designed to warn motorists of emergencies on the bridge.
   Lightning hit two closed-circuit television cameras and a
transformer during a heavy storm last week, Doug Moore, district
construction engineer for the Department of Transportation, said.
The lightning melted the cameras and caused some of the system's
circuits to overload.
   Transportation officials had hoped to activate the system by
this Friday, but officials have given the contractor a further 45
days to make repairs, Moore said.
   The 432-foot high bridge is a replacement of the old Sunshine
Skyway Bridge, which lost a 1,300-foot section when it was struck
by a ship during a squall in 1980. The disaster killed 39 people
whose vehicles fell into Tampa Bay.

   Auto heir John Dodge, who began a
one-year prison sentence for violating his probation on drug
charges this weekend, says he doesn't consider himself a criminal.
   Dodge turned himself in to the Palm Beach County Jail late
Friday just before the court-ordered deadline.
   The 34-year-old Palm Beach man said prison ``is something I have
to go through and I choose to look at it positively.''
   The youngest grandson of auto tycoon Horace Dodge Sr. was first
arrested in March 1985 and charged with 10 counts of forging
prescriptions to buy Dilaudid, a synthetic drug similar to heroin.
   He was placed on probation but was arrested again in September
1986 after police watched him take drugs from a safe-deposit box he
shared with his pharmacist girlfriend.
   In January, a judge sentenced Dodge to one year in prison but
postponed the sentence until April 1 so Dodge could attend custody
hearings over his 6-year-old son, John Dodge Jr.
   On March 23, Dodge agreed to give up custody of his son.
   Dodge could be out in five months, possibly earlier, if he
qualifies for a work-release program.

<HEAD>Court Reinforces Hospital Right to Challenge Medicare Regulations
in Ohio Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinforced the right
of hospitals to challenge federal regulations limiting the amount
of money they are reimbursed for treating Medicare patients.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the unanimous opinion, his
first since joining the court Feb. 18.
   Kennedy, in a case from Ohio, upheld the right of hospitals to
contest unfavorable rules to a governmental agency called the
Provider Reimbursement Review Board.
   The board must hear the hospitals' challenge to regulations even
if the hospitals previously abided by the rules in their own cost
reports, Kennedy said.
   He said the board's required review of such challenges assures
that Medicare providers will then have the right to take their case
to federal court if the board rules against them.
   ``By objecting to the regulation in the first instance in
proceedings before the board, the (hospitals) protected their right
to judicial review,'' Kennedy said. The board's decision on
reimbursement ``triggers the right of judicial review'' for the
hospitals, he said.
   The regulation challenged by the hospitals limited their
reimbursement for malpractice insurance premiums.
   The hospitals filed cost reports for 1980 with what is known as
a ``fiscal intermediary'' _ normally a private insurance company _
that accepted the government's limitations on malpractice
reimbursement.
   The hospitals then appealed to the Provider Reimbursement Review
Board for more money. But the board said it lacked authority to
review the case because the hospitals had not challenged the
regulation before the fiscal intermediary.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the board acted
properly.
   Kennedy said today that the appeals court ruling could deny the
hospitals the right to a federal court hearing when they challenged
governmental regulations.
   Today's decision was a victory for the Bethesda Hospital
Association in Ohio and the Deaconess Hospital Association of
Cincinnati.
   The Department of Health and Human Services since has revised
the formula to allow hospitals more money for malpractice costs.
   The case is Bethesda Hospital Association vs. Bowen, 86-1764.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Iran Wants Cleric Deported In Return for French
Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said it would help release French
hostages in Lebanon if France deports a Shiite Moslem cleric who
opposes Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Ash-Shiraa
magazine reported.
   The cleric, Ayatollah Mahdi Rouhani, said in Paris on Saturday
he was unaware of any such demands by Iran, but said he was ready
to go if necessary.
   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the
22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans and at
least three Frenchmen.
   Ash-Shiraa, the same weekly that disclosed U.S. arms sales to
Iran in 1986, said Saturday that negotiations between Paris and
Tehran for the release of French hostages ``have made big
progress'' and that France likely would deport Rouhani.
   In Paris, Rouhani, the leader of Shiites in Europe, said: ``I am
ready to leave before they ask me. It is my duty as a human being.''
   Rouhani, an Iranian, said he has lived in France for the past 25
years. He said he opposes Khomeini but supports the Islamic
Republic.
   Omran Adham, a French businessman of Syrian descent who has
worked to free French hostages, arrived Saturday in Beirut from
Paris, said Beirut airport officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The French Embassy in Beirut declined comment and it could not
be determined whether Adham had come to the Lebanese capital to
seek the release of hostages.
   In London, the Daily Mail, quoting unidentified French
intelligence sources, reported today that Iran and France are close
to sealing a deal to release the foreign hostages.
   The newspaper said Iran is demanding that France deport Rouhani
and ousted Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr in return. It
quoted the sources as saying both men agreed to leave France.
   The French hostages are diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel
Fontaine and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffman. Moslem militants
claimed in March 1985 that they killed a fourth French hostage,
researcher Michel Seurat, but no body has been found.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   An Easter outing for the disabled ended
with 14 people injured, one critically, when the van they were
riding in swerved off the road near here, struck a tree and burst
into flames.
   The van, from Beverly Farms Foundation Inc., a center for the
developmentally disabled, went off Illinois 267 near Godfrey on
Sunday evening, authorities said.
   Passing motorists stopped and helped passengers from the van
before it burst into flames, said state police Sgt. Lyndall Heyen.
   The van was destroyed by the fire, he said, and traffic on the
highway was blocked for an hour.
   Heyen said the driver lost control of the vehicle because of a
steering problem.
   The critically injured passenger was transferred from Jersey
Community Hospital in Jerseyville to St. Louis University Hospital.
Seven people were in area hospitals, supervisors said. The others
were treated and released.

   The brother of a man accused of killing a
police officer was found stabbed to death in the home they once
shared, authorities said today.
   An autopsy was to be performed today on the body of Peter
Laboda, 57, which was found by relatives in the family's home
Sunday afternoon, said Ingham County Prosecutor Donald Martin.
   ``This is not a suicide. This appears to be a homicide. There
appears to be evidence of a break-in. The body may have been there
as long as early Friday,'' Martin said.
   Authorities said they didn't have any suspects in the death of
Laboda, a local renting agent and firewood supplier.
   In February, Lansing Parks Police Officer Julie Englehardt was
gunned down outside the Laboda home. Peter's brother John, 46, is
accused in that slaying.
   ``To have two homicides at the same address is rather bizarre to
say the least,'' Martin said.
   John Laboda is in Ingham County Jail pending psychiatric tests
and court hearings. The brothers had lived with their sister at the
home.

<TEXT>
   A passer-by found three pieces of poisoned
chocolate near a shrine and playground, but police said today that
no one was hurt in the latest of a series of poisoned candy
incidents since September.
   ``A poison reaction was detected'' in police checks on three
individually wrapped pieces of chocolate found Sunday in the grassy
compound of a shrine in Itano, in Tokushima Prefecture about 320
miles southwest of Tokyo, said Tokushima Prefectural Police
spokesman Sumio Okuyama.
   He said a passer-by found the chocolates and called police. A
section of the shrine compound is used as a playground, Okuyama
said.
   He did not say what poison was in the candies and said police
would not disclose who had manufactured them.
   Police suspect the same group or same person was responsible for
a string of incidents in which poisoned chocolates were left on the
ground near a playground and schools, he said.
   Okuyama said on March 24, police found 21 chocolates tainted
with potassium cyanide in the compound of a kindergarten in a town
near Itano.
   He said poisoned chocolates were discovered in two kindergartens
in neighboring Kagawa Prefecture last Sept. 8, and similar
incidents were reported that month in at least three other
Tokushima schools.
   Okuyama would not confirm a news report that a threatening
letter was sent last month to Lotte Co., a candy maker based in
Tokyo, demanding $320,000.
   In 1984, a group calling itself the ``Man With 21 Faces''
planted poisoned candy on store shelves in a bid to extort money
from the manufacturers. No one was reported hurt.
   The group also kidnapped Katsuhisa Ezaki, president of the
confectionery firm Ezaki Glico, and demanded a ransom of $4 million
and 220 pounds of gold.
   Ezaki escaped unharmed three days later. But a series of
extortion threats against Ezaki Glico and at least 30 other food
companies ensued, including a demand for $800,000 from Glico's
rival, Morinaga and Co.
   ``The Man With 21 Faces'' apparently stopped planting poisoned
candy about two years ago, although police insist no payoffs were
made. There were no arrests.
   Another police official of Tokushima Prefecture who spoke on
condition of anonymity said investigators did not know if the
latest plantings of poisoned candy were connected to the 1984
incidents.

   Former Attorney General Elliot Richardson says
President Reagan is ``too willing to let his friends get away with
things'' and the case of Edwin Meese III is only the latest example.
   Reagan's determination to stand behind Meese as attorney general
follows the pattern he has shown with other embattled
administration figures, Richardson said Sunday.
   Richardson, who in the Nixon administration held the office now
occupied by Meese, said during an interview on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' that Reagan ``has been much too tolerant, too amiable, too
willing to let his friends get away with things because he has
somehow come to believe in them as individuals and, in effect, has
looked the other way.''
   The resignation of two top Justice Department officials last
week touched off bipartisan calls in Congress for Meese to quit.
Meese is the subject of a nearly year-long criminal investigations
and the officials said the attorney general's legal problems were
hurting the department's operations.
   But two top political party leaders said Sunday that the Meese
matter won't be a long-term political issue in and of itself.
   ``I don't think it will have much impact either on the Senate or
the presidential races. It will be a factor but I don't think it
will be a major one, a decisive factor,'' Sen. George Mitchell of
Maine, a former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, said in an interview on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   He said the Meese matter would become part of the Reagan legacy
of aides and issues that have led to investigations, indictments
and convictions in the general category of ethical breaches.
   ``I don't think you could single out any one thing and say this
is the decisive factor. I think there will be an appeal in the
presidential race in terms of integrity and ethics in government
generally, of which this is one factor.''
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, which finances GOP candidates,
said that although ``there is some political liability involved ...
I don't think it's going to have a measured impact on the
elections.''
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., predicted on ``Meet the Press''
that the Meese affair would have ramifications for the Republicans
in November. He cited ``George Bush's squirming on the subject last
week,'' in which Bush declined to say Meese should resign, but said
the attorney general should be above reproach.
   Richardson, who resigned in 1973 rather than obey Nixon's order
to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, called for
Meese to resign.
   ``He should step down from that office when there are serious
questions as to his integrity even though the proven guilt may not
be conclusive.''
   He said the climate at the Justice Department is the worst since
the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' of the Watergate-plagued Nixon
administration, in which Richardson and other top officials left
the department.
   Asked if Meese could rightfully refuse to resign on the basis
that he won't be hounded out of office by a ``lynch mob,''
Richardson replied:
   ``The question isn't whether an individual can be improperly
affected by charges or accusations that have not yet been fully
proven. The question is whether an attorney general of the United
States should cling to office despite the impairment of his
effectiveness that has been brought about by a situation like
this.''
   However, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., also speaking on the NBC
program, said Sunday that Meese should not be ``chased from office
unless he's proven guilty of something.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today upheld the
espionage and theft of government property convictions of a former
intelligence analyst who gave spy photographs of a Soviet ship to a
British military journal.
   Samuel Loring Morison, grandson of the late Pulitzer
Prize-winning naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison, was convicted
in October 1985 of giving U.S. satellite photographs of a Soviet
nuclear aircraft carrier under construction to Jane's Defence
Weekly.
   A unanimous three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals rejected arguments by Morison, who worked for the Navy,
that the statutes under which he was found guilty were
unconstitutionally vague and were intended to cover ``classic
spying'' for a foreign government rather than leaks to the press.
   The defense also said the espionage prosecution violated
Morison's right to free speech and would intimidate low-level
government employees from leaking information which would embarrass
their superiors.
   ``The mere fact that one has stolen a document in order that he
may deliver it to the press, whether for money or other personal
gain, will not immunize him from responsibility for his criminal
act,'' the judges said. ``To use the First Amendment for such a
purpose would be to convert the First Amendment into a warrant for
thievery.''
   Morison remains free on a $100,000 appeal bond, his attorney,
Mark Lynch, said today from his Washington, D.C., office. Lynch
said he has not seen the 4th Circuit's opinion and has not decided
whether to seek a rehearing before the full court or a review by
the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Because Morison's prosecution raised questions about the
Constitution's free speech and freedom of the press guarantees,
several news organizations _ including The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the nation's three
major television networks _ filed briefs in the case.
   The photos were published by Jane's on Aug. 11, 1984, and later
by other publications and news organizations.
   Morison, a civilian employee of the Naval Intelligence Support
Center in Suitland, also was convicted of the theft of the photos
and government documents that described a May 1984 explosion at
Severomorsk, the main ammunition depot for the Soviet Union's
northern fleet.
   Morison was sentenced to two years in prison by U.S. District
Judge Joseph H. Young of Baltimore.
   Prosecutors said Morison's actions endangered national security
because the photographs revealed to the Soviets how a U.S. spy
satellite worked. They also said Morison leaked the photos to get a
full-time job with Jane's after doing part-time work for the
publication while employed by the Navy.
   Defense attorneys contended their client was trying to educate
the public about a Soviet naval buildup and that the photographs
showed the Soviets nothing they had not learned already from a
former CIA official's 1978 sale of the spy satellite's operations
manual to a Soviet agent.
   Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III agreed that First Amendment
interests in the case were significant, but said the way in which
the photographs were released threatened an equally important
public interest, ``the security of sensitive government
operations.''
   ``To reverse Morison's conviction on the general ground that it
chills press access would be tantamount to a judicial declaration
that the government may never use criminal penalties to secure the
confidentiality of intelligence information,'' Wilkinson wrote.
   The judge added that the prosecution of Morison ``was not an
attempt to apply the espionage statute to the press for either the
receipt or publication of classified materials.''
   Judge J. Dickson Phillips Jr. said the espionage statutes ``as
now broadly drawn are unwieldy and imprecise instruments for
prosecuting government `leakers' to the press as opposed to
government `moles' in the service of other countries.''
   However, Phillips said, the limiting jury instruction in
Morison's case, requiring proof that the leaked information was
either potentially damaging to the United States or might be useful
to an enemy, was a sufficient remedy.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let St. Louis Airport Ban Demonstrations</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today refused to let a St.
Louis airport ban all demonstrations, soliciting and distribution
of political and religious literature from its terminals.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that an airport
terminal, like a city street and sidewalk, is a public forum where
free-speech rights must be accommodated.
   To date, every federal appeals court that has studied the issue
has ruled that a government-run airport terminal is such a public
forum. But the high court has never said so.
   The justices came close last June when they unanimously struck
down a sweeping ban on free speech at Los Angeles International
Airport.
   Saying that officials there tried to create ``a virtual First
Amendment Free Zone,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the
court then that such regulation goes far beyond trying to ease
congestion or disruption of traveling services.
   ``We think it obvious that such a ban cannot be justified even
if (the airport) were a non-public forum because no conceivable
governmental interest would justify such an absolute prohibition of
speech,'' O'Connor said.
   The St. Louis case acted on today began when a fired airline
employee unsuccessfully sought permission to protest in the Lambert
Airport terminal.
   Jesse Jamison had been employed with Trans World Airlines for 16
years before he was fired in 1984. According to court records,
Jamison believes his firing was discriminatorily based on his
mental illness. He has been diagnosed as a manic-depressive, the
court documents said.
   After the director of the city-owned airport refused to let
Jamison protest against TWA in the airport terminal, Jamison sued
in federal court.
   A federal judge ruled that the process by which the city and
airport director decide who may protest at Lambert Airport violates
free-speech rights, but also ruled that Jamison's protest could be
barred.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Sept. 10 also ruled
that the airport's general ban on such demonstrations is
unconstitutional _ and it ordered the trial judge to come up with a
way to accommodate Jamison's ``right of peaceful picketing.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for St. Louis argued among
other things that the lower courts wrongly concluded that an
airport terminal is a traditional public forum.
   ``In stark contrast to parks, streets and sidewalks, which have
a unique tradition as sites for assembly and debate, airport
terminals have traditionally been devoted to one purpose only _ to
serve as a safe, efficient and pleasant nexus for air and ground
modes of transportation,'' the appeal said.
   ``Therefore, the Lambert Airport terminal is not a traditional
public forum,'' it added.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Let stand a $3 million libel award won by a cigarette
manufacturer against CBS and a television anchorman in Chicago
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the award _
one of the largest libel verdicts ever upheld on appeal _ violated
the rights of the network and its newscaster.
   _ Agreed to review rulings limiting Korean Air Lines' financial
liability for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died _ the
shooting down of a KAL passenger jet over Soviet airspace.
   The justices said they will study arguments that the airline
should have to face more than $75,000 in damages for each death.
   _ Refused to block the Federal Trade Commission from
investigating allegedly anti-competitive practices of state
agencies that license and regulate professionals.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that FTC
investigators may subpoena members of a Massachusetts board that
regulates pharmacies in the state.
   _ Agreed to decide whether New York City's powerful Board of
Estimate must be reapportioned to meet equal-voting standards.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by city officials who said
applying the one-person, one-vote rule to the governing body will
undermine its ability to balance regional and local interests.
   _ Reinforced the right of hospitals to challenge federal
regulations limiting the amount of money they are reimbursed for
treating Medicare patients.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the unanimous opinion, his
first since joining the court Feb. 18.
   The justices, in a case from Ohio, upheld the right of hospitals
to appeal certain unfavorable regulations to a governmental agency
called the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.
   _ Gave federal agencies more leeway in dealing with labor unions
representing their employees.
   The justices, in a unanimous and unsigned opinion, said a
federal employer's rules or regulations may not be challenged as
unfair labor practices until found to have been imposed without any
``compelling need.''
   _ Rejected an appeal by Alaska natives who want to hunt
migratory birds in the spring and summer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that treaties
between the United States and other nations generally ban the
hunting between March 10 and Sept. 1.
   The airport case is St. Louis vs. Jamison, 87-943.

   The Supreme Court today gave federal agencies
more leeway in dealing with labor unions representing their
employees.
   The justices, in a unanimous and unsigned opinion, said a
federal employer's rules or regulations may not be challenged as
unfair labor practices until found to have been imposed without any
``compelling need.''
   The decision whittles the power of the Federal Labor Relations
Authority, the agency created to handle disputes between federal
employers and unionized employees, in such circumstances.
   The case stems from a decision by the Army in 1981 to shut down
operations at the Aberdeen Proving Ground for three days after
Thanksgiving to conserve energy.
   Workers there were required to claim the time off as vacation
days that they might have preferred to use some other time.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers accused the Army of an unfair labor practice for refusing
to bargain over the decision.
   The FLRA ruled that the Army failed to prove there was ``a
compelling need'' for its vacation-days rule and ordered the Army
to negotiate with the union.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the FLRA
ruling, stating that the burden is on the FLRA to show there is no
compelling need for a government agency's rules before it orders
agency bargaining with a union.
   Another federal appeals court had upheld the FLRA in a similar
case, and today's decision upholding the 4th Circuit court's ruling
resolves the conflict in a way unfavorable to the authority.
   The justices said federal law clearly states ``that where a
matter is covered by regulation, no duty to bargain arises until
the (FLRA) has first determined that no compelling need justifies
adherence to the regulation.''
   The court said the ``compelling need'' finding by the FLRA
cannot be combined with an unfair labor practices proceeding.
   The case is FLRA vs. Aberdeen Proving Ground, 86-1715.

<TEXT>
   The cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. opened
today with the judge barring all but six reporters from the jury
selection process and ordering that no information be publicly
disclosed until a jury is chosen.
   Judge Francis McCaffrey said he expected jury selection to last
three days, adding that any published information could unduly
influence the jury pool.
   Zaccaro, the son of former presidential vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, is accused of selling one-quarter gram
of cocaine to an undercover policewoman. The charge, to which
Zaccaro pleaded innocent, carries a five-year prison term.
   He arrived in Vermont District Court in Rutland flanked by his
attorneys, while Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., arrived
in a separate car and followed their son into court.
   Zaccaro's parents pulled up swivel chairs immediately behind the
defense table. Ferraro, a lawyer, wrote last-minute notes and
reviewed court paperwork.
   Attorneys met with McCaffrey for more than an hour before the
judge's decision was announced.
   McCaffrey said six of 11 reporters in the courtroom could attend
jury selection, but said they would not be able to publish the
information until the jury was empaneled.
   ``It is important that we get an impartial jury. That is where
you persons have become an issue,'' McCaffrey told the reporters.
His decision, he said, ``essentially provides a compromise.''
   The trial opened more than two years after Zaccaro, a former
Middlebury College student, was arrested.
   The case has progressed slowly because of appeals to the Vermont
Supreme Court, including a claim that Zaccaro was singled out for
prosecution because of his famous mother.
   Two weeks ago, one of the challenges paid off, when Vermont
District Judge Francis McCaffrey dismissed one of the two original
charges against Zaccaro.
   But Zaccaro's attorneys, Charles Tetzlaff and Thomas Sherrer,
lost their bid to have the case thrown out altogether; the Vermont
Supreme Court refused to dismiss the charges last year.
   Zaccaro, 24, was a senior at Middlebury College when he was
arrested Feb. 20, 1986, outside a Middlebury restaurant where he
worked.
   The prosecution alleges the undercover agent, Laura Manning,
bought one-quarter gram of cocaine from Zaccaro at his off-campus
apartment earlier that day.
   Police searched Zaccaro's car and said they found eight grams of
cocaine, $1,600 in cash and checks, and documents described as
records of drug transactions.
   The arrest came in the wake of rumors that Zaccaro allegedly was
selling drugs on campus and had earned the nickname ``the
pharmacist,'' Middlebury Police Sgt. David Wemette said at the time.
   Zaccaro also was charged with possession of cocaine with intent
to sell, the charge thrown out because it hinged on the evidence in
Zaccaro's car.
   In 1986, McCaffrey said there was insufficient evidence for the
search warrant used to obtain the items. In throwing out the charge
two weeks ago, he rejected the contention of Addison County State's
Attorney John Quinn that the charge could be proven based solely on
Manning's observations.
   No more motions or requests were expected before or at the start
of the trial, Quinn said Friday. Tetzlaff declined to comment.
   The case will be followed closely by students at the liberal
arts college, even though Zaccaro dropped out in the fall of 1986,
said Sharon Harper, the editor of the college newspaper, The
Middlebury Campus.
   ``The case of John Zaccaro opened up the administration to drug
problems in Middlebury,'' Harper said. ``I think it's important
that people see how this case follows through so they know that
there's (a penalty) for drug abuse.''

   A man accused of killing three people
and wounding his ex-wife and two others at a church funeral
apparently was upset over a land dispute involving his former
in-laws, authorities said.
   Michael Leslie Rainey, 41, was arrested Sunday without incident
near the Mountain Home Baptist Church. Authorities recovered a
handgun and a shotgun in the parking lot, said Henderson County
Sheriff's Capt. Tom Hatchett.
   Rainey, barefooted and wearing a green jumpsuit, appeared this
morning before Henderson County District Court Judge Zoro Guice,
who ordered Rainey held without bond until an April 12 probable
cause hearing.
   District Attorney Alan Leonard told Guice he would seek the
death penalty.
   Rainey, who was not handcuffed, looked down at the table in
front of him while Leonard read the first-degree murder charges.
   His only statement came in response to Guice's inquiry whether
he wanted a court-appointed attorney.
   ``I signed a waiver a few minutes ago. I don't want one,''
Rainey said, adding that he intended to hire his own lawyer.
   Witnesses say Rainey walked into the church on Easter Sunday to
view the body of Effie Collins Justice, the grandmother of his
ex-wife, Andrea Rainey, and left. Mourners in the church then heard
gunshots.
   ``The funeral was just getting ready to start,'' said Lester
Justice, Mrs. Justice's nephew. ``They had just closed the coffin.
The family had just arrived and had gotten out of the car when I
heard several shots fired.
   ``We began to hear more gunfire, a shotgun and pistol both.
Someone said a man was out there shooting the family. I didn't know
whether he would come inside if he was after anybody else or not.''
   Hatchett said Rainey retrieved the weapons from the trunk of his
car and opened fire, killing his wife's parents, Wilford Owensby,
61, and Ponnelle Owensby, 60. Also killed was Scott Bowles, 24. It
was not immediately known whether Bowles was related to Rainey.
   Three people were wounded, including Mrs. Rainey, 40, of
Kennesaw, Ga., authorities said.
   Witnesses say Mrs. Rainey sped away from the church after the
shooting in her Ford sedan, which was riddled with bullet holes.
She reached the Hendersonville city limits before authorities
stopped her. They transferred her and two other wounded women from
the blood-stained car to ambulances.
   Mrs. Rainey, who is also the granddaughter of Mrs. Justice, was
listed in good condition with bullet wounds in her neck, said Mary
Ann Morris, spokeswoman for Margaret Pardee Hospital in
Hendersonville.
   Sheila Johnston, 30, of Fletcher, wounded in the chest, was
taken to Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, where she was in
critical condition, nursing supervisor Evelyn Woody said. Mrs.
Johnston's daughter, Wendy, 11, was wounded in the leg and was in
good condition.
   The shootings apparently stemmed from a family argument over
real estate held in Edneyville, an unincorporated town about 260
miles east of Raleigh, Hatchett said.
   Rainey owned land near the church, which is adjacent to property
belonging to Mrs. Rainey's family, Hatchett said.
   Curtis and Ethel Justice, distant relatives of Effie Justice who
lived next door to the church, said they had planned to attend the
funeral but changed their minds when it began to rain.
   ``We heard the shots from down here, but I couldn't imagine what
it meant,'' Mrs. Justice said.
   ``I'm so thankful I wasn't up there, I could shout. I probably
would have had a heart attack,'' she said. ``This is the terriblest
thing that's ever happened up here.''

   Jury selection began today for the murder
retrial of a man once sentenced to death for the slayings of six
members of a farm family 15 years ago.
   A federal appeals court in 1985 threw out death sentences
against Wayne Carl Coleman, his half-brother Carl Isaacs and George
Dungee and ordered new trials.
   A barrage of pretrial publicity in the rural, southwest Georgia
county of Seminole, site of the 1973 killings of the Alday family,
made a fair trial there impossible, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled.
   Isaacs, accused mastermind of one of the state's most notorious
killing sprees, was convicted again in a retrial in January in
Perry, a small town 30 miles south of Macon, and given a new death
sentence.
   Coleman is being retried in DeKalb County Superior Court in this
Atlanta suburb and Dungee will be retried later this year in
Columbus. Prosecuting attorney Charles Ferguson has said he will
seek the death penalty for them also.
   A DeKalb County jury last month ruled Coleman, now 41, competent
to stand trial, despite his attorneys' contention that the last 15
years behind bars have rendered him in need of mental treatment.
   Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson of Hawkinsville, who is
presiding over all three retrials, last month refused to approve
public funds to hire an expert to help defense attorneys during
jury selection. He also rejected defense motions to prohibit
prosecutors from using Coleman's lack of remorse against him in a
sentencing trial, if he is convicted.
   A confession by Coleman was presented as evidence in the first
trial.
   The three defendants, escapees from a Maryland prison farm, were
convicted in 1973 for the deaths of Ned Alday, 62; his brother
Aubrey, 57; Ned's sons, Jerry, 35, Chester, 30, and Jimmy, 25; and
Jerry's wife Mary, 26.
   Five of the six were shot to death as they arrived at Jerry
Alday's rural mobile home on May 14, 1973, as Isaacs and his
companions were burglarizing it, according to previous trial
testimony. Mary Alday was taken to a wooded area, raped and shot to
death.

<HEAD>Airline Writes To Boeing About Defects</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version on financial wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Japan Air Lines has written The Boeing Co. about
defects found in two Boeing aircraft types and demanding the giant
U.S. airplane manufacturer tighten its quality control, airline
officials said today.
   They said the March 30 letter by JAL's president, Susumu Yamaji,
to Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz reported the mistaken installation
of engine heat detectors in Boeing 747s, found last December, and
the discovery last month of wrong wiring in fire extinguishers in
the cargo hold of 767s.
   The letter demanded that Boeing make greater efforts to achieve
better quality control, said the officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity. But they stressed the letter merely was intended to
call Shrontz's attention to the problems and was not a formal
compaint.
   Craig Martin, director of public relations for Boeing Commercial
Aircraft in Seattle, confirmed Yamaji's letter was received and
said, ``I believe Mr. Shrontz has responded to it as we would to
any customer, but as far as a specific response, I do not believe
one has been formulated.''
   ``So far as we know,'' the complaints were accurate, Martin
said, and an investigation was under way to determine how the
mistakes occurred. ``I think those were one-time occurrences,'' he
said.
   The problems cited would not normally constitute safety threats,
Martin said. ``I think you could construct a scenario in which they
might (present safety problems); as a matter of course, no,'' he
said.
   Japanese criticism of the Seattle-based aircraft maker has
mounted since the crash of a JAL Boeing 747SR in August 1985. All
but four of the 524 people aboard the plane were killed in
aviation's worst single-plane disaster.
   A Japanese government report last June concluded the crash
resulted from Boeing's improper repair of the plane's rear cabin
wall after the aircraft scraped its tail during a landing in 1978.
   Boeing has acknowledged the improper repair.
   In July 1986, JAL became the first airline to establish a
permanent office at Boeing when it sent two inspectors to Seattle
to conduct regular quality checks on Boeing's assembly and
maintenance of JAL aircraft.
   The officials said JAL currently has 60 747 jumbo jets and 11 of
the twin-engine, widebody 767s.
   Other airlines also send representatives to Seattle while their
jets are being manufactured, Martin said.

   One hyperactive student is greatly helped by
Ritalin, so the teacher encourages the parents of others to try it
_ and they tell other parents about the happy results. Ritalin's
success many have led to its excess: some fear it's now overused.
The second story in a three-day series, `R' is for Ritalin, looks
at the increased role of a prescribed drug in the nation's schools.

   Something new is tucked amid the workbooks, pencils and
sandwiches in an increasing number of school backpacks each day. It
is a pill, no bigger than button candy, prescribed to help
youngsters get through their multiplication tables, spelling tests
and geography lessons.
   The pill is Ritalin, a stimulant that can assist hyperactive
children in concentrating, completing their work and controlling
frenzied outbursts that turn classrooms to chaos.
   Some parents describe Ritalin as a godsend.
   ``It was like the difference between day and night,'' said Nancy
Anderson, a Buffalo, Minn., mother whose daughter, 11, and son, 8,
take the drug. ``The first day Sarah took Ritalin was the first
time she was able to read something and understand it. That night
she told me and started crying.
   ``I cried, too.''
   But Ritalin's success may be leading to its excess. As many as 1
million children may take the drug, and happy endings like the
Andersons' are encouraging more doctors to prescribe it, sometimes
with less triumphant results.
   Many doctors say superficial diagnosis and limited follow-up
have led to the medicating of the children who don't need it, or
who need additional counseling to learn how to tame the confusion
inside their minds.
   ``I know of several communities and school districts where
people are excessively prescribing medication for children without
adequately evaluating them,'' said Russell Barkely, director of
psychology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
Barkely said these communities to the west and north of Boston
``may be seeing the children once a year and renewing the
prescription by telephone.''
   The five states with the highest per-capita consumption of
Ritalin _ Utah, Maryland, Georgia, Minnesota and Michigan _ have
begun investigating its use.
   Georgia officials alarmed by high Ritalin use in suburban
Atlanta found school personnel were urging Ritalin treatment on
parents.
   ``We looked at what was driving the marketplace and wound up
with the conclusion that it was the school systems,'' said Andrew
Watry, executive director of Georgia's Composite State Board of
Medical Examiners. ``Parents were calling us with a lot of
anecdotal information about how their arms were twisted to take the
medication.''
   LaVarne Parker, a suburban Atlanta mother, believes Ritalin is
used as a chemical billy club to subdue problem students. She has
filed suit against the doctor and school officials who encouraged
her to medicate her son.
   ``It's almost like someone said we've got a pill to give a child
who won't do what you want him to do,'' she said.
   When Susan Marshall's son, Bradley, had trouble in first-grade
at Hingham, Mass., she sought medical help on the school's advice.
Her pediatrian prescribed Ritalin.
   But Bradley did not improve and, according to his mother,
suffered from insomnia, depression and a loss of appetite. Mrs.
Marshall finally took Bradley to a neurologist who found the boy's
problems were due to a hemiparesis, a limited brain injury not
treatable by Ritalin.
   The Marshalls are suing the pediatrician.
   ``He simply prescribed Ritalin,'' she said. ``We were not given
a diagnosis.''
   Parents like Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Parker claim Ritalin carries
harsh side effects, from facial tics and lost appetite to
depression and suicide. Their anxieties are fed by the Citizens
Commission on Human Rights _ a group, supported by the Church of
Scientology, that opposes psychiatric treatment and is conducting a
nationwide media campaign against Ritalin.
   Doctors and government regulators dismiss most charges against
Ritalin as exaggerated and unsubstantiated, citing some 500
research papers that mostly agree side effects are temporary and
minimal.
   Manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp. and known generically as
methylphenidate, Ritalin is one in a small group of drugs used to
treat childhood behavioral disorders and narcolepsy. As a Class II
drug, it is listed, along with amphetamines, morphine and the
painkiller Demerol, as a drug with legitimate use but high
potential for abuse.
   Prescribing drugs for problem children is not new. The Roman
physican Galen suggested opium for overactive children in the first
century. Research in the 1930s indicated that treating hyperactive
children with stimulants, usually amphetamines, helped calm them.
Ritalin was developed in 1955 as an alternative to amphetamines.
   What has changed in the last decade is the awareness _ some say
overawareness _ of the malady that Ritalin is used to treat.
   Known variously over years as hyperactivity, hyperkinesis and
minimal brain disfunction, the syndrome is now called attention
deficit disorder, a catch-all of symptoms ranging from wild,
destructive behavior to an inability to concentrate or, in
educational jargon, ``stay on task.''
   Researchers say 3 to 10 percent of the nation's 45 million
schoolchildren exhibit some symptoms of ADD.
   The American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic bible lists
ADD symptoms such as fidgeting, difficulty awaiting turns at games,
blurting out answers before being called on, excessive talking and
a penchant for losing things.
   While many parents would recognize some of these noisome habits
in their children, ADD parents say it is the intensity of the
behavior that separates theirs from normal children.
   ``It's the constantness of it,'' said Jean Conner Harrison, a
West Newbury, Mass., mother who publishes a newsletter for ADD
families. ``You are trapped in it. You can't take these children
anywhere, you can't get babysitters to stay with them. It is so
emotionally tough to get through this day by day.''
   ADD is the single most researched area of child psychology. Some
600 research papers on the subject were published last year. ADD
seminars are commonly held around the country for doctors,
educators and parents.
   Regional diagnostic clinics have sprung up, often near research
centers in states with high Ritalin use. As a result, more and more
children are being diagnosed with ADD and treated with medication.
   Critics note with alarm that Ritalin production has doubled
since 1983. But the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which
sets production levels, says that statistic sheds little light on
how many people take a drug.
   A better gauge is number of prescriptions. An FDA report shows
2.2 million prescriptions for Ritalin and related drugs were filled
and refilled in 1986. The figure does not show the number of people
using the drug, but it does indicate an increase in use _ the
number is 14 percent higher than in 1983.
   ``That's unusual,'' said Carlene Baum, an FDA psychologist.
``The average annual increase in prescriptions for most drugs is 1
percent.''
   No one is certain how many of the nation's children get a daily
dose of Ritalin. Daniel Safer, a Johns Hopkins University child
psychiatrist who has studied surveys at various school districts,
believes 600,000 to 800,000 schoolchildren receive stimulant
medication, mostly Ritalin.
   ``It's been going up steadily,'' said Safer, ``and I don't see
it going down.''

   In 1971, 1.1 percent of Baltimore County school students were
taking Ritalin, Safer said. By 1983, the number was up to 3.5
percent.
   ``The increase is a multiple of factors: parent-teacher
satisfaction, the ease of treatment and its relative success,'' he
said.
   Most Maryland school districts recommend parents seek medical
help only after teachers, counselors and administrators have met to
discuss a problem student.
   ``We don't prescribe Ritalin,'' said Robert Dubel,
superintendent of the Baltimore County School District. ``All we do
is refer children to medical help, the same as we would if a child
had problems seeing a blackboard. We would tell the parents and
they would have the child's eyes examined.''
   Yet when Baltimore County officials, threatened with a lawsuit,
reviewed their policy late last year, they found such a measured
response was not always the case.
   ``I am convinced that we probably do have some people out there
who sidestep some of the procedures and say `You have to get that
child on Ritalin,''' said Thomas Farley, an assistant county
attorney.
   In Georgia, Watry, the director of the medical examiners' board,
tells of one school counselor who would ``pressure parents on a
mass scale to use Ritalin.''
   ``He told parents he was playing the percentages because it had
helped with so many cases,'' said Watry.
   Late last year a special study group for the Georgia Department
of Education recommended school personnel be warned against
``pressuring'' parents to seek medication and leave diagnosis and
treatment to medical professionals.
   But often these professionals are not doing a complete job.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends extensive testing
and discussion among doctors, parents and educators before
prescribing medication.
   Guidelines also stress that medication is only part of the
solution. Counseling, therapy, tutoring, even special classes for
parents are recommended.
   ``Almost everybody in the field will say you have to do more
than give the pill,'' said James Satterfield, a Los Angeles-area
psychiatrist whose research found hyperactive children responded
dramatically better to a combination of therapy and Ritalin.
   ``We've heard about pediatricians who have said, `Here's six
months of prescription, come back when it runs out,''' he said.
``That gives a message to parents that here's this magic pill, you
don't need any other treatment.''
   But some question if many of those getting treatment need it.
   Thomas Long, a psychologist and director of the National Center
for Family Studies at the Catholic University of America, believes
doctors choose medication when counseling and different parenting
might be enough.
   ``We have created a society that relies on medication to solve
our problems,'' he said. ``The first thing you go to when you have
a problem is some kind of pill.''

   Each weekday morning our 7-year-old son Tom
starts breakfast with a tiny white tablet he calls his ``daydream
pill.''
   The pill has become part of our daily routine. There was a time
when my wife and I, people who think twice before taking aspirin,
would have been incredulous had you told us we'd be giving our
child a behavior-modifying drug.
   As Tom grew into an active toddler, he gave no indication
anything was amiss; we were sure he was a superstar. With blond
curls and a sturdy well-coordinated body, he was quick and good at
everything: an early walker and talker, a cheerful elf full of
eager questions.
   But by the time Tom was ready for kindergarten, we were
concerned. He couldn't seem to keep his mind on a task. He didn't
like to play alone, and he didn't stay with an activity for more
than a few minutes.
   We hoped it was just immaturity. Perhaps we had spoiled him?
   With his quick mind and pleasing personality, Tom drifted
through kindergarten. We wondered why he wasn't picking up academic
skills as quickly as we'd anticipated, but his school reports were
generally good and he was having a good year with soccer and T-ball.
   Everything changed in first grade. He was one of 30 classmates,
and most of the school day required independent seatwork.
   We realized something was very wrong when Tom began collapsing
into tantrums of free-floating rage and frustration after school.
We were completely taken aback, especially because we had high
confidence in his small, caring school.
   We were mystified by our little soccer player's rage. At what?
Was it the oversized class?
   The school principal assured us that, although the class was
large, the children were doing fine.
   We spoke to psychologist friends about whether some deep-seated
anxiety could be surfacing.
   Tom himself was unable to give us any clues until one night in
the midst of an emotional collapse, he said, over and over, ``I'm
dumb.''
   Fortunately for us all, Tom's class took a group intelligence
test about this time. Tom's score was so high in comparison with
his performance that the principal called us in. She wanted to do
further testing and mentioned ``attention deficit,'' a term that
seemed to fit the child we knew.
   The principal also mentioned Ritalin, saying she had seen
dramatic changes in kids like Tom. We were appalled by the
suggestion we give our boy a drug, skeptical that this was the
proper way to approach a learning problem.
   Instead, we tried a highly publicized diet and spent an
agonizing month keeping Tom from many of his favorite foods, ones
with cyclamates and additives. The stress of the diet increased
Tom's rage and frustration.
   We next urged the school to institute behavioral techniques,
such as rewarding Tom for even brief periods of concentration.
These helped, but only moderately, and we started to reconsider.
   After reading all the research we could find, and considering
the side effects (such as the possibility Tom would be one-quarter
inch shorter as an adult), we concluded the risks of trying Ritalin
were minimal.
   A factor in our decision was our own dependence on our morning
cups of coffee, which help us get going and stay focused. Were we
depriving Tom of the equivalent of a morning cup of coffee?
   The pediatrician said Tom might temporarily lose his appetite or
have trouble sleeping. None of this happened, and Tom was
surpringly amenable to taking the tiny pill.
   Indeed, Tom was the first to let us know it was making some
difference. He started calling it his ``daydream pill,'' saying it
helped him control the daydreams that distracted him in class. His
teacher soon reported his behavior was improving, and we saw this
reflected in his school work.
   Still, we couldn't be certain it wasn't just a placebo effect on
Tom and the teacher.
   This year, with a new teacher who shared our lingering
reservations, we withheld the Ritalin for a couple of weeks.
Simultaneously, Tom and his teacher reported he couldn't
concentrate and urged us to return to the pill.
   With the increased demands of second grade, Tom has begun taking
an additional 5 milligrams at lunch. Occasionally, when he's having
trouble staying with his homework, he'll say, ``Maybe I should take
a pill.'' Last week we filled yet another prescription at the
pharmacy where we are now recognized as regulars.
   Last month, Tom proudly brought home a report card with B's in
math and English and A's _ his first ever _ in reading and
spelling. In categories such as deportment, handwriting and follows
directions, which last year produced a string of F's for failure
and N's for non-satisfactory, there were 2 N's and 13 S's _ for
satisfactory.
   Is Ritalin a panacea? No. Even with the pill, Tom's attention
deficit still requires the guidance of a skillful teacher.
   Are we comfortable about him taking medicine? Yes and no.
   We like the results but are uncomfortable treating a symptom,
the cause of which no one knows. We are especially uncomfortable
that the psychologists and doctors seem unconcerned why Tom has
trouble paying attention.
   Will we keep giving him the pill? Yes, at least while Tom thinks
it's helpful. We'll also keep trying to find a deeper understanding
of what's involved.
   As Tom says, ``It's not perfect, but it works, some.''

<HEAD>Parents Beware: Diagnosing ADD Difficult, Treatment Complex</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-R Is for Ritalin II</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For parents facing a decision on whether to medicate a child
with Ritalin, psychiatrists and pediatricians offer some advice:
Make sure the diagnosis is made carefully and the treatment
involves more than just taking pills.
   Ritalin is commonly prescribed for hyperactive children with
attention deficit disorder, but too often they are diagnosed
without proper testing and evaluation, they say.
   And if a treatment does not include counseling and educational
therapies, it probably is faulty, the experts add.
   ``I think there are children given the drug who do not have
ADD,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``And if they do, drugs alone are
not going to resolve that. Very often mistakes are made of making
the diagnosis and then only prescribing the drug.''
   Parents, Wiener said, should expect five things of their
physician:
   _ A complete and thorough diagnosis.
   _ Information about possible side effects.
   _ Close monitoring of the effects of medication through regular
visits.
   _ Information about alternative treatments.
   _ An explanation of the consequences if medication is not used.
   ``If the physician does not do these things, parents have every
reason ... to seek medical help elsewhere,'' Wiener said.
   The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says an ADD diagnosis must
include signs of inattention and impulsivity, as well as onset
before age 7 and duration of at least six months. Other disorders
must be ruled out.
   An ADD study group appointed by the Georgia Department of
Education called ADD ``one of the most time-consuming of the
disorders of childhood to evaluate.''
   Dr. Michael Levine, a San Antonio, Texas, child hyperactivity
expert, said he spends two hours taking history and 10 hours
testing before making an ADD diagnosis.
   ``When you see Johnny staring out the window or bouncing off the
walls, you don't know if he's off-task because of a brain filter
problem (treatable with Ritalin), a learning disability or a
behavioral problem,'' Levine said.
   Once an ADD diagnosis is made, experts say, too often the child
is treated only with medications such as Ritalin _ the prescribed
way to go until as recently as 1970. The latest research shows that
a more effective treatment combines medication with therapy and
counseling.
   ``Everyone agrees that you have to do something more than give a
pill,'' said Dr. James Satterfield of Encino, Calif., who pioneered
some ADD research. ``In the real world, most of the children get
one treatment, seldom two, never three _ and the most common would
be medication.''

mourn relatives, provincial police said Monday.
   The family was riding in the smaller truck Saturday when the big
rig smashed into their vehicle and sent it plunging into an
irrigation canal 50 miles west of Bangkok, said Police Lt. Saree
Chiemboon.
   Four people in the pickup, including a 4-month-old girl and her

   The family had been bound for a traditional rite where families
honor their dead.
   Police said the truck may have been speeding.

   A woman is suing the city school system
in an effort to see that her daughter gets a full education, in
spite of her allergies to chemicals that would be found in a
biology class.
   Her mother, Mary Ann Hickey, wants a closed circuit television
monitor so her daughter Laura can take the science class without
leaving home. The town cable antenna company has offered to install
it free.
   The school system has offered a correspondence course instead.
   Laura tried the alternative course, but withdrew after six weeks.
   ``The correspondence course may have given my daughter the same
credit, but not the same education,'' said Mrs. Hickey. ``There
were no lab experiments, no lectures and no teacher interaction.
That's not an equal education.''
   No date has been set for a court hearing. Last week, a hearing
officer for the Massachusetts Board of Education, Lindsay Byrne,
ruled for Wellesley High School in the dispute.

<TEXT>
   A nationwide strike over wages by
505,000 public school teachers entered its fourth week Monday,
affecting 7.2 million students aged 3 to 18.
   Primary and secondary school teachers in every province except
northeastern Corrientes have been on strike since the school year
began March 14, demanding a minimum salary of about $117 a month.
Corrientes' teachers reached a separate accord in March.
   The government in this economically pressed nation has admitted
that teachers' salaries are low but says it cannot afford to pay
more than $85 a month.
   The teachers' union has rejected the offer as insufficient,
saying many teachers are forced to work a second job because some
instructors in the poorer provinces outside Buenos Aires are paid
as little as $54 a month.
   Most private schools have been unaffected by the strike.

   About 600 people, mostly Lumbee Indians,
rallied today at a recreation center where slain Indian leader
Julian Pierce recently kicked off his campaign for a state
judgeship.
   The marchers carried signs reading ``Gov. Martin: We need that
special session'' and marched quietly down several city blocks,
singing ``Amazing Grace'' and ``We Shall Not Be Moved.''
   Pierce, a Lumbee, was shot to death at his home on March 26 in
what authorities said was a domestic dispute.
   Several elected and religious leaders from across the state
attended the rally, which was not endorsed by local officials.
   The seat Pierce was seeking was created by the General Assembly
to improve the chances of minorities in superior court elections in
racially troubled Robeson County. Blacks and I8
percent of Rondians make up 5beson County's population.
   The lone candidate remaining in the race, white District
Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, will be declared the winner of the
judgeship without special action by the Legislature to allow
another candidate.
   ``Julian Pierce and (the late Lumbee leader) John Godwin are not
dead,'' said Judy Brooks, a white woman who is married to a Lumbee.
``They live on together in our hearts, and we're going to continue
their struggle.''
   Godwin, a found a cause.''
   Besides Michaux, state Rep. Sidney Locks, who represents Robeson
County, and Dan Bell, a Democratic candidate for secretary of
state, attended the rally.
   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson sent the group a telegram
urging Robeson County citizens to ``keep up the fight.''

<TEXT>
   Police swooped down on bars in
Manila's notorious Ermita district Monday night and hauled away
dancing girls, bartenders and scores of foreign patrons.
   It was the second raid on the city's red light district in a
week as part of a drive by Manila Police Chief Brig. Gen. Alfredo
Lim to clean up what was once the capital's most fashionable
neighborhood.
   Police refused to say how many clubs had been raided or how many
people had been taken into custody because the operation was
continuing. One policeman said they were concentrating on clubs
believed owned by foreigners.
   One French tourist, who refused to give his name, said police
asked foreign patrons to produce passports and visas.
   On March 28, police raided dozens of nightclubs in Ermita and
rounded up more than 1,000 dancers and ``hospitality girls.''
Police released those who could produce work permits following
medical examinations, and officials later said about a third of the
women were suffering from venereal disease.
   The crackdown followed a proposal by Lim to phase out bars and
nightclubs, which he said were fronts for prostitution. Bar owners
protested that their businesses pumped millions of dollars into the
country's laggard economy.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, noting today the ``unfinished business''
remaining two decades after Martin Luther King Jr. was slain,
plunged into back-to-back battles with Democratic presidential
rival Michael Dukakis in Colorado and Wisconsin.
   Forty-five Democratic delegates are at stake in tonight's
Colorado caucuses. Tuesday's Wisconsin primary offers an even
richer prize _ 81 Democratic delegates, plus a boost heading into a
round of big-state contests in coming weeks.
   Jackson walked a Hispanic neighborhood in Milwaukee, courting
votes and saying the 20th anniversary of King's death has ``an
historic meaning for all.''
   ``In some sense today the challenge is to end the unfinished
business and end economic violence against family farmers and
average working people,'' said Jackson, a King protege in the
turbulent 1960s.
   A day earlier, the presidential candidates spent Easter Sunday
courting church congregations.
   Pat Robertson, his Republican bid all but crushed by Vice
President George Bush, claimed a divine mandate for his
presidential candidacy.
   ``We are laying the foundation for a great victory for this
nation. It may not be in 1988. ... but I am not going to quit,''
said the former television evangelist. ``That is His plan for me
and this nation.''
   Jackson preached Easter sermons to huge crowds in Colorado,
telling them: ``Hope has been unleashed.''
   Jackson also called again for Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega to leave his country but said he would not act as
mediator between the United States and Noriega. Jackson released a
letter from Noriega in which the dictator rejected ``any imposition
and any political and economic program that will be dictated from
Washington, D.C.''
   Jackson chalked up another win over the weekend in the Virgin
Islands Democratic caucus, picking up 634 votes to Dukakis' 37. The
contest netted Jackson only three delegates, but he drew closer to
the Massachusetts governor in their seesaw battle for supremacy in
the delegate race.
   The latest AP tally gave Dukakis 653.55, Jackson 646.55, with
the uncommitted tally at 468.6. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore had
381.8 and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, 169.5.
   Gore and Simon are both badly in need of a win in Wisconsin.
Gore has not had a victory since Super Tuesday; Simon has only won
in his home state of Illinois.
   Simon searched for votes as children hunted eggs at an Easter
egg hunt in Madison. He said he shares Jackson's ``passion for the
less fortunate,'' adding: ``I offer not only passion, but the
experience to do something about it.''
   Simon also said his credentials are better than those of Dukakis.
   ``I have the experience with national issues that, frankly, Mike
doesn't have,'' he said.
   A poll in the Milwaukee Journal, conducted Wednesday and
Thursday, gave Dukakis a narrow lead over Jackson in Wisconsin, 43
to 35 percent. Gore had 15 percent and Simon 5 percent, according
to the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
   Although its survey suggested Gore was behind, the newspaper
endorsed him, calling the Tennessee senator the ``best qualified to
serve as president.'' The Journal praised Jackson for `shaking up
the political process'' but said his lack of experience in
government was a weak point.
   Gore has been hitting at Jackson's lack of government experience
and questioning his electability. Dukakis, however, shied away from
predicting how Jackson would do against Bush.
   ``I don't think there is any way of knowing,'' he told reporters
outside a Milwaukee church on Sunday. But, he added: ``I think
George Bush is beatable. I'd like to be able to run against him.''
   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk also sidestepped questions
about Jackson's electability.
   ``The Democratic Party will do its best to nominate, I hope, the
most electable candidate in order to win in November,'' Kirk said
Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   A poll published in this week's editions of U.S. News & World
report said if Jackson became Dukakis' running mate, the Democrats
could defeat the Republican ticket, regardless of who became Bush's
running mate. A Dukakis-Jackson ticket was supported by 47 percent
of the 1,004 people contacted last week by telephone for the poll,
while a hypothetical GOP ticket of Bush and Illinois Gov. Jim
Thompson would win 42 percent, the survey said.
   The poll, conducted by the Roper Organization, had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Another poll, published in this week's editions of Newsweek
magazine, said two-thirds of Democrats and voters leaning toward
the party say Jackson should get the nomination if he leads in
popular vote and delegates at the time of the convention _ even if
he doesn't have the 2,082 delegates needed to nominate.
   Jackson's campaign chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, raised the possibility of a floor fight at the convention
this summer if the Jackson forces believed the delegate race had
not played out fairly.
   ``I think if the rules need to be challenged we will do so,''
said Brown, also interviewed on the ABC program.
   However, Brown said he did not believe Jackson was automatically
entitled to the nomination if he led in popular vote and delegate
totals at the end of the primary season.
   ``I only believe he's entitled to the nomination if we succeed
in producing the appropriate number of delegates,'' Brown said.
   Jackson himself downplayed the possibility of a convention fight.
   ``We're certainly going to stand for fairness, but I hope it
won't come to a fight. I think that most Democrats are going to
stand for that which is fair and that which is right,'' he said as
he campaigned in Colorado.

<HEAD>Water Fights in Old Warsaw on `Pouring Monday'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland was all wet on Monday.
   Nationwide, young people hurled buckets of water at each other
in the annual post-Easter folk holiday of ``Pouring Monday.''
   In Warsaw, the teen-agers also doused a few police officers who
wandered by the good-natured and vaguely political water games that
pitted a contingent of ``Smurfs'' dressed in blue against
green-clad ``Water People'' in Castle Square in the Old Town.
   The 1,000 participants' slogans had tongue-in-cheek
confrontational overtones: ``Freedom and Water,'' ``Free the
Buckets,'' and ``Smurfs (Cops) Go Home.''
   The banned but still active Independent Students Union organized
the unusually large gathering in Warsaw, according to a recent
Warsaw University graduate who identified herself only as
Agnieszka, 24.
   Easter Monday is a national holiday in Poland and the day's
traditional activity in the countryside is for peasant boys to soak
not-so-reluctant girls with water. In Polish, the holiday is called
``Smigus Dyngus'' (pronounced SHMEE-goos DING-goos), a non-sense
phrase meaning the custom of pouring water on people on Easter
Monday.
   The phrase ``pouring water'' is slang for ``lying'' in Poland,
and the student group raised a sign _ later pulled down by police _
that said: ``The government spokesman is the best example of
pouring water.''
   Agnieszka said the group was following the example of a Wroclaw
opposition organization, Orange Alternative, that specializes in
opposing the government with humor and satire.
   Police in groups of twos and threes walked through the crowd,
stopping some people to check IDs and at times ordering young
people to quietly empty their buckets of water.
   But whenever they appeared about to detain one of the
participants, who ranged in age from about 13 to 25, the police
were surrounded by groups chanting, ``Let him go!'' In the end, it
appeared no one was arrested.
   Plastic bottles, buckets, water bombs made with plastic bags and
even tree sprayers were the weapons of choice in the battles under
sunny skies with temperatures in the 50s.
   At one point, two officers found themselves completely
surrounded and water filled the air. Although one policeman's back
was soaked, the officers laughed along with their attackers.

   Sparks from workmen's torches started a
fire at the American cultural center today, damaging the building
but causing no injuries, U.S. and fire officials said.
   The fire was an accident that had ``absolutely no connection''
with the visit of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, said Douglas
Rose, deputy director of the U.S. Information Service in New Delhi.
   Carlucci arrived in New Delhi today and held two rounds of talks
with Indian officials on defense cooperation and the peace process
in Afghanistan.
   The fire began on the fifth floor, the building's top story, at
about 3:45 p.m. after sparks ignited flammable gas canisters stored
there, said S.K. Dheri, the city's chief fire officer.
   He said the sparks came from men repairing or cutting an
air-conditioning duct with acetylene torches.
   About 150 firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at the
American Center, which houses U.S. Information Service offices, a
library, theater, meeting rooms and a media center, Dheri said. The
computer center on the fifth floor was safe, he said.
   Damage was estimated at between $100,000 and $300,000, said
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in Washington. Rose
said the damage was largely confined to the air-conditioning room.
   The building is on a main street close to the central Connaught
Circle shopping arcade. The street was closed to traffic.
   Four cooking gas and oxy-acetylene cylinders stored on the fifth
floor exploded in the fire, Dheri said. Firefighters wore gas masks
when they entered the building.
   James McGinley, director of the U.S. Information Service in New
Delhi, said the building was evacuated within five minutes.
   ``The important thing is that everyone is safe,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Preparing To Withdraw Some Afghan Troops, But No Timetable
Set</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets have begun preparations to remove
the first of their 115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan although no
date has been set for the withdrawal and U.N. peace talks are at an
impasse, administration sources say.
   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, made an
unexpected trip to Kabul on Sunday to discuss ``serious
difficulties'' caused by the U.S. and Pakistani demands that Moscow
halt aid to the Afghan government at the same Washington stops the
flow of covert arms to guerrilla forces.
   Shevardnadze has said the Soviets will withdraw even if the
talks collapse.
   And a U.S. government analyst said ``the intelligence community
is unanimous in reporting that preparations for a withdrawal have
commenced.''
   But the analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed
that the exact time, duration and manner of the Soviet withdrawal
remained unclear.
   Shevardnadze, in an interview with the official Tass news
agency, said he was going to Kabul ``to discuss and coordinate with
the Afghan leadership the various options for action, in all their
aspects, in the event that the Geneva process fails to bring about
the desired results.''
   U.S. sources declined to provide details about Soviet
preparations to withdraw the Red Army, which first entered
Afghanistan in 1979. In the past, the Soviets have removed some
peripheral units, such as anti-aircraft batteries, but replaced
them with others. The current preparations are of a different
character, the sources said.
   Whether or not an agreement is reached, the Soviets are expected
to start a withdrawal by pulling units of their 40th Army from
garrisons south of Gardez and from Kandahar, Shinand and Herat in
the West, according to administration officials.
   These units are the most exposed to attack from a Mujahedeen
force estimated by administration analysts to number about 200,000.
   Soviet diplomats have indicated a willingness to withdraw
between 30 percent and 50 percent of their forces within the first
90 days of an agreement, pulling out the remainder within 10 months
after a pact is signed.
   Afghan guerrillas, as well as Pakistani and U.S. diplomats, say
a 10-month withdrawal timetable would allow the Soviets and their
allies to destroy the Mujahedeen if the flow of U.S. arms were cut.
   But some U.S. analysts believe an initial withdrawal of up to 50
percent of Soviet forces would include tactical air units operating
over south and west Afghanistan, leaving garrisons manned by the
army of the Kremlin-backed government open to Mujahedeen attack.
   Morale is already poor among the 40,000 Afghan government
forces, according to the guerrillas. And U.S. analysts believe the
confidence of the government has been shaken badly by the Soviet
announcement that the Red Army will leave.
   If the U.N. talks produce an agreement, the Soviets are thought
likely to leave elite special purpose forces to provide a security
shield for the Kabul regime, while moving the bulk of their
departing forces to the Soviet Union, possibly to an area just
north of the border.
   If the U.N. talks collapse, and the Soviets decide on a
unilateral withdrawal, ``all bets are off,'' one analyst said.
   One likely option, however, would be for the Soviets to
concentrate forces around Kabul and within a recently created
province in the far north, along the Soviet border.
   The new province of Sari Pull was created from parts of Balkh
and Juzjan provinces, which are separated from the Soviet republics
of Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan by the Amu Darya River. The
Mujahedeen have staged a number of raids, none very destructive,
across the remote border, according to Afghan and Soviet reports.
   The largest town in the new province is Mazar-i-Sharif, which
U.S. analysts have long considered a likely final staging area for
a Soviet withdrawal.

   Christo, the unconventional artist whose
creations have included fabric-wrapped islands and a 24{-mile cloth
fence, now wants parts of Japan and southern California to blossom
with 3,000 huge umbrellas.
   ``A big part of it is a comparison of differences and
similarities between places and people with a lot of affinities,''
Christo, 52, said recently by telephone from his studio in New York.
   His plan calls for about 1,500 yellow umbrellas, 19.8 feet high
and 26.4 feet in diameter, to blossom like California poppies in
the Tehachapi Mountains 60 miles north of Los Angeles. At the same
time, he wants to unfold 1,500 umbrellas _ identical except blue _
in the lush rural valley of Japan's Ibaraki prefecture, 72 miles
north of Tokyo.
   ``The project has two parts and will happen only like that,''
Christo said of ``The Umbrellas: Joint Project for Japan and the
USA.''
   That's assuming he gets all the necessary government permits and
permission from scores of landowners, and raises an estimated $8
million to $10 million. The California Legislature already backs
him.
   ``Like always, the permits is the most unknown,'' he said.
``Nobody can assume how, in what direction they will move. And they
probably are the most consuming in time.''
   For decades, Christo has created art on an epic scale.
   In 1985, he wrapped the almost-400-year-old Pont Neuf bridge in
Paris with 440,000 square feet of champagne-colored fabric. Two
years earlier, he surrounded 11 islands in Florida's Biscayne Bay
with 6 million square feet of shocking pink polypropylene. In 1976,
he used a white translucent fabric to create ``Running Fence,'' an
18-foot-high fence that ran like a ribbon across 24{ miles of Marin
and Sonoma counties in northern California.
   Each of his big projects, Christo said, aims to create ``a
gentle disturbance of space, to create new boundaries, new
territories and a new type of range limitation of very routine
space that everybody uses.''
   ``I see these projects as a poetical scream _ a scream of
freedom,'' the Bulgarian-born artist said.
   Not everyone shares his vision. For more than 15 years the West
German government has refused to let him wrap fabric around the old
German parliament, the Reichstag.
   Christo hopes to bring The Umbrellas to fruition in October
1990. Like his other works, the umbrellas will be exhibited for a
few weeks and then removed.
   At Christo's insistence, financing must be arranged privately,
backed by the sale of his preparatory drawings, studies, collages,
scale models and early works.
   ``And of course this part of my work, these projects are very
anti-materialistic,'' Christo said. ``They are very linked to huge
poetical freedom. They deal with art, not like a commodity, but art
very personal, relaxed, a very open experience on many levels.''
   Christo has discussed his proposal with officials in Los Angeles
and Kern counties, and a resolution of general support was adopted
last Sept. 9 by both houses of the California Legislature.
   In California, Christo said his team must obtain the permission
of 51 private property owners on the 18{-mile-long site, from
Gorman along Interstate 5 over the Tejon Pass and down the
Grapevine grade.
   In Japan, there are 750 private landowners on the proposed
12{-mile-mile site.
   In California, the largest single landowner whose permission
will be needed is the Tejon Ranch Co.
   Tejon vice president and general counsel Dennis McCarthy said
there are concerns about public use of ranch property and
liability, but added that it's hard to buck the groundswell of
support Christo has gained among public officials.
   ``It leaves landowners in a situation _ I don't know exactly how
to say this _ but you don't want to be a wet blanket, or `The
Grinch Who Stole Christmas,''' McCarthy said.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
today renewed his call for Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega to leave Panama and released a letter in which Noriega
rejected ``any political and economic program that will be dictated
from Washington D.C.''
   Jackson, who had sent a letter to Noriega on March 22 urging him
to leave his troubled country, said he would forward Noriega's
response to the State Department and Congress.
   ``I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the
Panamanian people for Gen. Noriega to leave. Today I reiterate my
public moral appeal for him to depart,'' Jackson said.
   At the State Department, deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
indicated displeasure over Jackson's communications with Noriega.
   ``In our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that Noriega
likes to use to buy time,'' Ms. Oakley said. ``We have available
channels of communication with Noriega if and when they are needed.
We think it would be best to continue to use these channels
exclusively.''
   The Jackson campaign released an unofficial translation of a
letter from Noriega.
   Noriega said the Panamanian ``defense forces ... reject any
imposition and any political and economic program that will be
dictated from Washington, D.C.''
   ``My duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is
governed by the Panamanian constitution and law of the defense
forces,'' he said.
   In a postscript, Noriega wrote, ``I have been lied about! I have
been villified! I have been humiliated internationally! I consider
myself to be been persecuted by illegal action by so-called
justice, by political interests of your nation. I, as a Christian
before you, denounce this untrue (sic).''
   Early today, Jackson told National Public Radio he would not
play a mediating role between the U.S. government and Noriega. ``I
see no direct role in the relationship myself.''
   ``My appeal to him was to leave,'' Jackson said Sunday in an
interview with The Associated Press during his Colorado swing.
Jackson said that in his letter to Noriega, he offered to do
whatever he could ``to facilitate his exit'' from that country.
   Jackson said a friend of his, Cirilo McSween of Chicago, had
gone to Panama at his request to meet with Noriega. Jackson
described McSween as a friend of 20 years who was originally from
Panama.
   Using rhetoric from his recent speeches, Jackson said U.S.
policy has been misguided:
   ``We've set the forest on fire to smoke one person out,'' he
said.
   The civil rights leader, who has made international trips in the
past to try to negotiate solutions to complicated crises, said he
did not think he would go to Panama.
   ``I doubt that,'' Jackson said.
   Later, at a Colorado Springs news conference, Jackson gave this
response:
   ``No, I'm not prepared to go right now,'' he said.
   Jackson said the current situation is full of danger for the
United States in the critical Central American region.
   `Unless the present crisis ends, we could lose by having
tremendous anti-Americanism in Panama,'' Jackson said.

   About 8,000 doctors at government
hospitals and health clinics went on strike Monday to press demands
for hiring recent medical school graduates.
   The walkout will continue through Wednesday at the country's
eight state-run hospitals and its more than 500 health centers,
according to a doctor known only as Mohibullah who spoke for the
Bangladesh Medical Association.
   Special teams of doctors stayed on duty to treat emergency
patients.
   A government spokesman condemned the strike, which he said was
depriving the poor of medical treatment.
   The government doctors' main demands include jobs for about 800
newly graduated interns and promotion of government doctors at the
country's rural health centers.
   The government spokesman said officials were negotiating with
strike leaders.
   Mohibullah said nearly 3,000 more private doctors would join the
strike for its final day Wednesday. He said doctors may walk out
indefinitely unless the government grants their demands.

   The Roman Catholic church, shepherd
of Latin America's soul for centuries, often minds its politics as
well and is a component of life: mediator, pacifier, giver of
praise and criticism by turns.
   Latin Americans often turn to the church in times of crisis, and
have done so in this troubled country.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath of Panama has been asked to mediate
the political dispute that began in June over the leadership of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who commands the Defense Forces and
controls the civilian government.
   It is a role the church has filled in nearby nations, most
notably El Salvador and Nicaragua.
   Panama's Catholic church has become increasingly critical of
Noriega's rule, but there are those who say McGrath and the
nation's priests and bishops have not taken a firm enough stand
against him.
   The church often is criticized in Latin America but is an
imposing presence, rich in tradition, with the confidence of a
large share of the population and the grudging respect of
politicians and the military.
   Through nearly two millennia, the Roman Catholic church has been
the Inquisition but also propagator of the faith, preserver of
literature and translator of the classics.
   It is a priest blessing military leaders, another doing
community work in slums or among poor peasants, one performing a
society wedding while his brother takes up the guerrilla cause,
demanding social justice.
   It is a reclusive conservative bishop rejecting new ideas, and
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of El Salvador speaking from his
church through loudspeakers so those in the government palace could
hear him complain about military violations of human rights. He was
assassinated in March 1980.
   Some say wryly that Latin Americans will do anything for the
church except go inside one, but as an institution it generally is
trusted more than governments or the military.
   ``People perceive the church as an impartial institution capable
of settling disputes,'' said Fidel Chavez Mena, a leader of the
Christian Democratic Party in El Salvador. ``The culture and
religious sentiment of our people make them believe in the church.''
   As political and armed strife increased in the countries of
Central America in the past decade, the church has become involved
more frequently, to mediate or criticize regimes it sees as
violators of human rights.
   McGrath has publicly demanded that the military submit to
civilian rule, but churchgoers who want him to be more critical of
Noriega held a public protest outside his cathedral last week.
   The archbishop has not been an outspoken critic in the past.
Those close to him describe McGrath as a diplomatic negotiator who
would rather avoid a direct confrontation with the military.
   Many of his priests are foreigners and the government forces
them to have their residency visas stamped each three months no
matter how long they have spent in Panama.
   McGrath has acknowledged holding several meetings with Noriega
in search of a solution to Panama's political conflict.
   ``The church has tried to build a silver bridge for Noriega to
leave,'' the Rev. Fernando Guardia, vicar of the Panama City
diocese, said in an interview.
   Mediation by the church was agreed upon by the parties involved
and was made through President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, and Carlos Andres Perez and
Daniel Oduber, former presidents of Venezuela and Costa Rica
respectively.
   Another Latin American archbishop, Cardinal Obando y Bravo of
Nicaragua, has been a thorn in the side of the leftist Sandinista
government. But it also turned to him as mediator when it first
agreed to talks with the U.S.-supported rebels.
   In 1974 and 1978, Obando y Bravo had acted as go-between for the
Sandinista National Liberation Front, then outlawed, and the
right-wing government of President Anastasio Somoza to obtain the
freedom of future President Daniel Ortega and other top leaders.
The Sandinistas won the civil war in July 1979.
   Obando y Bravo served as a witness earlier this month when the
Sandinistas and the rebels, known as Contras, signed a preliminary
cease-fire agreement.
   ``It is not easy to mediate, but the church always is ready to
contribute to national reconciliation,'' he said in a recent
interview.
   In El Salvador, Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas is involved in
stalemated talks between leftist rebels and the U.S.-backed
government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio of Guatemala has agreed
to mediate between leftist rebels and the government, which has yet
to return to the negotiating table after a first round in October.
   In Honduras, the church is part of the ``national reconciliation
commission'' set up under the Central American peace plan of Aug. 7
to seek political solutions to internal conflicts.
   ``The church has the moral authority and credibility to act as
mediator,'' said Adan Fletes, leader of Nicaragua's Social
Christian Party.

   Robert Matheny refused to set his clock
ahead to daylight-saving time with the rest of Kentucky.
   But that's not surprising. He's been an hour or two behind
everyone else in Lincoln County for 40-odd years.
   Way back in World War II he refused to switch from Central to
Eastern time when the Eastern zone was first enlarged to include
parts of eastern and central Kentucky.
   ``I don't remember exactly when we went on fast time, but it was
back when old Roosevelt went in, and it's ruined the whole
country,'' Matheny complained. ``I never have changed my time since
it started. I'm on the time that I was born on, back before the
boundary lines changed.''
   Matheny 76, and his wife, Beatrice, own a 268-acre farm a few
miles south of Stanford, where Matheny sometimes is in the field
from sunup to sundown, working on what he calls ``slow time.''
   Slow time is an hour behind fast time when fast time is standard
time; it's two hours behind during daylight-saving season.
   ``You can't get the cows up on fast time; chickens don't go to
roost. And what burns me up, I go down here and get these boys to
work, and it'll be good, dry, hay-baling time, you know,
everything's running sweet,''
   ``Here it comes along 3 o'clock, by my time, and they'll say,
`We've got to quit, it's 5 o'clock.' Well, from 2 on till 6 or 7
o'clock, you've got three or four good hours running there, and me
paying them by the hour. But they've got their watch moved up, and
it's 5 o'clock.
   ``A lot of 'em I just tell 'em, `When you go, you're gone.'''
   Matheny pulled a Waltham pocketwatch he has been carrying for 50
years out of his overalls.
   ``It's only got one gear in it,'' he said. ``What would I gain
by changing it? The sun comes up and goes down just the same on
your time as it does on mine.
   ``Course, my time's about out anyway. I'll be 77, If I live to
see it, on the 11th of May at 10:30 .... my time.''

<HEAD>Town Marshal Faked Own Abduction Due To Marital Problems,
Stepmother Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE MOUNTAIN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town marshal who claimed to have
escaped from kidnappers who intended to kill him actually faked the
episode to gain attention from his estranged wife, the officer's
stepmother says.
   ``It pushed him to the deepest end to do such a horrible
thing,'' said Mary Stokes. ``It's a sad situation.''
   Authorities said Sunday that the abduction Thursday of Gary
Stokes, who was the object of a large manhunt until he turned up
the next day, had been staged.
   Highway Patrol Investigator Sammy Pickens said he would turn
over to the district attorney's office information showing the
abduction was faked. No charges have been filed.
   Mrs. Stokes said Sunday that her stepson and his wife were
having marital problems, and that Stokes made up the abduction
story up to get his wife's attention.
   ``It hurts us,'' she said. ```We're relieved we know about it
and can get him some help.''
   Stokes, the town's only full-time policeman, said Sunday he
would have no comment.
   Stokes disappeared early Thursday after calling for back-up
units while investigating what he said was the attempted burglary
of a store in this town of 860 residents.
   Police found Stoke's car with the engine still running, the
lights on and his radio microphone hanging outside the door. His
police revolver and billfold were found nearby.
   Stokes reappeared Friday morning claiming to have escaped from
his captors. He told authorities he was abducted at gunpoint by
four men after he confronted them during a burglary at the store.
   ``It was manufactured,'' Pickens said. ``He was not kidnapped.''
   Mayor Robert Godwin said Blue Mountain's board of aldermen would
meet to discuss Stokes' future as marshal, a position he's held for
four months.
   ``I really can't tell you anything for sure until after Tuesday
night when the board meets,'' Godwin said Sunday when asked about
possible disciplinary action.
   Stoke's stepmother she didn't feel residents would be angry at
him, saying most residents were just glad he returned unharmed.
   But Brenda Hunter, an employee at the convenience story where
Stokes claimed he was abducted, said people in town ``are mad
because they had a snow job pulled on them. Everybody thought `This
is a good man here. This is who we need as marshal.'''

   A Panamanian government official
suggested the United States might have staged a chase of its
ambassador's car to justify an eventual military evasion.
   The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador Arthur Davis was pursued for
two miles in Panama City on Sunday by a government military vehicle
with its siren blaring. It called the incident serious.
   Sunday's communique signed by Justice Minister Rodolfo Chiari de
Leon said the incident began when a police sergeant saw civilians
in three vehicles following the ambassador's car with ``an
exaggerated display of automatic arms.''
   ``We do not want to think that they are fabricating false
accusations against our armed forces to justify an announced
invasion of Panama, and we reiterate the intent of the Panamanian
government to protect the life and property of residents and
foreigners, including North Americans,'' the communique said.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley escalated the administration's criticism of Panama over the
incident.
   ``We consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to be
serious as always,'' she said today. ``We will take the necessary
steps to protect Americans. I am condemning the incident from the
podium; we regard the action as deliberate harassment.''
   The United States is sending 1,300 additional troops to Panama
on Tuesday. Troops were loading weapons and supplies into
helicopters today in the United States in preparation.
   American officials have said the forces are intended to protect
U.S. bases and American citizens. Washington has declared it will
not use military force to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose
leadership has been the focus of a national political and economic
crisis.
   Sunday's edition of the government-run newspaper La Republica
quoted pro-government labor leaders as urging Panamanians to
prepare for an American invasion when the additional troops begin
arriving.
   There are 10,000 troops stationed at the U.S. Southern Command
in Panama. Pentagon officials said more troops may be sent if they
are needed.
   The chase on Sunday ended an otherwise calm Easter holiday and
ushered in a week of uncertainty for Panamanians. A Roman Catholic
Church offer to mediate an end to the country's political crisis
was set to expire at midnight tonight.
   Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone said Davis was leaving the
home of Vatican Ambassador Jose Sebastian Laboa when the Panamanian
vehicle ``began following immediately, picking them up right
outside the gate.'' He said it tried to stop the chauffer-driven
car with its lights and sirens.
   ``The ambassador's driver, in accordance with instructions, did
not stop. The ambassador was driven to his residence, and the other
vehicle followed all the way,'' Kneebone said. The residences are
about two miles apart.
   ``We consider this serious,'' Kneebone said. He declined to
comment on what security provisions Davis had but said they were
normal under the circumstances. No weapons were displayed in the
chase, he said.
   Embassy vehicles are clearly marked with special license plates.
   Earlier Sunday, Kneebone said Davis had gone to pay his respects
on Easter to the papal nuncio, who is dean of the diplomatic corps
in Panama.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, in hiding since he was ousted from the
presidency after he tried to fire strongman Noriega Feb. 25, has
called for the United States to intervene militarily and remove the
general. Noriega is under indictment on U.S. drug-trafficking
charges.
   Monsignor Marcos Antonio McGrath, the archbishop of Panama City,
agreed to requests by several foreign governments to act as
mediator in the dispute, and several opposition leaders said they
would back the idea under certain conditions.
   McGrath set a midnight deadline for all parties to agree to the
arrangement or the offer would be withdrawn. The government has not
responded.
   The opposition conditions included guarantees that Noriega, head
of the nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind
the civilian government, indicate a willingness to resign and to
leave the country.
   A letter made public Friday by three opposition leaders said any
agreement would have to be guaranteed by the church, four
government officials to be named later, and the presidents of Costa
Rica and Panama.
   Meanwhile, leaders of the National Civic Crusade, the main
opposition coalition, were considering Sunday whether to call off a
2-week-old general strike that lost momentum last week.
   The United States has frozen Panamanian assets in American
banks, choking the flow of dollars, the official currency in
Panama. Banks have remained closed since March 3.
   Most Panamanians are saving cash for essentials, and thousands
of families, especially in poorer areas, have had to turn to
church-run food kitchens for their meals. The cash shortage has
kept the government from paying its estimated 130,000 employees for
a month.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   AIRPORT DEMONSTRATIONS
   
   The court refused to let a St. Louis airport ban all
demonstrations, soliciting and distribution of political and
religious literature from its terminals.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that an airport
terminal, like a city street and sidewalk, is a public forum where
free-speech rights must be accommodated.
   The case is St. Louis vs. Jamison, 87-943.
   
   LIBEL
   
   The court let stand a $3 million libel award won by a cigarette
manufacturer against CBS and a television anchorman in Chicago
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the award _
one of the largest libel verdicts ever upheld on appeal _ violated
the rights of the network and its newscaster.
   The case is CBS vs. Brown & Williamson, 87-1354.
   
   KAL
   
   The court agreed to review rulings limiting Korean Air Lines'
financial liability for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died _
the shooting down of a KAL passenger jet over Soviet airspace.
   The justices said they will study arguments that the airline
should have to face more than $75,000 in damages for each death.
   The case is In Re KAL Disaster, 87-1055.
   
   REGULATORS
   
   The court refused to block the Federal Trade Commission from
investigating allegedly anti-competitive practices of state
agencies that license and regulate professionals.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that FTC
investigators may subpoena members of a Massachusetts board that
regulates pharmacies in the state.
   The case is Monahan vs. FTC, 87-1015.
   
   HOSPITALS
   
   The court reinforced the right of hospitals to challenge federal
regulations limiting the amount of money they are reimbursed for
treating Medicare patients.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the unanimous opinion, his
first since joining the court Feb. 18.
   The justices, in a case from Ohio, upheld the right of hospitals
to appeal certain unfavorable regulations to a governmental agency
called the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.
   The case is Bethesda Hospital Association vs. Bowen, 86-1764.
   
   FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS
   
   The court gave federal agencies more leeway in dealing with
labor unions representing their employees.
   The justices, in a unanimous and unsigned opinion, said a
federal employer's rules or regulations may not be challenged as
unfair labor practices until found to have been imposed without any
``compelling need.''
   The case is FLRA vs. Aberdeen Proving Ground, 86-1715.
   
   EQUAL VOTING
   
   The court agreed to decide whether New York City's powerful
Board of Estimate must be reapportioned to meet equal-voting
standards.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by city officials who said
applying the one-person, one-vote rule to the governing body will
undermine its ability to balance regional and local interests.
   The case is Board of Estimate vs. Morris, 87-1022.
   
   
   ALASKA BIRDS
   
   The court rejected an appeal by Alaska natives who want to hunt
migratory birds in the spring and summer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that treaties
between the United States and other nations generally ban the
hunting between March 10 and Sept. 1.
   The case is Alaska Federation of Natives vs. Alaska Fish and
Wildlife Federation, 87-1157.
   
   RENT CONTROL
   
   The court rejected a challenge to New York City's rent control
law.
   The justices, citing the lack of ``a substantial federal
question'', refused to hear arguments that the law ``confiscates''
landlords' property by limiting yearly rent increases for
apartments to 7.5 percent.
   The case is Greene vs. Mirabel, 87-1212.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops stopped vehicles and blocked
escape routes to Malaysia during a nationwide search Monday for the
leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt.
   The military said four more soldiers jailed in plots against
President Corazon Aquino also were missing.
   The government told foreign and Philippine reporters not to
publish or broadcast interviews with former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, who fled a prison ship in Manila Bay before
dawn Saturday with 14 of his navy guards.
   Honasan's coup attempt left at least 53 people dead and hundreds
wounded. He had been confined in the prison ship since his arrest
Dec. 9.
   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said the armed
forces had received reports that Honasan, 39, had been seen in
Manila, rural Luzon and Mindanao island, about 500 miles south of
the capital.
   ``The search for ex-Col. Honasan continues,'' Florendo told
reporters. ``However, right now, we don't have any concrete lead to
follow.''
   Florendo denied allegations by opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
that troops raided Enrile's vacation house in Batangas province
Sunday during the search.
   Honasan was Defense Ministry security chief when Enrile was
minister of national defense. Enrile was fired in November 1986
after the government said it prevented a coup attempt by his
followers.
   Florendo said three officers and an enlisted man jailed for
involvement in the 1987 coup attempts were missing from the
detention center at Villamor Air Base. But he said the four fled
because of ``pressing family problems'' and their escape was not
related to Honasan's breakout.
   Armed troops seeking Honasan manned checkpoints around Manila
and searched private vehicles. The Philippine Constabulary
strengthened security in southern provinces to prevent Honasan from
slipping out of the country by boat to Malaysia, a traditional
escape route for fugitives and political dissidents.
   Share prices on the Manila Stock Exchange closed 2.28 per cent
lower Monday after trading resumed following the Easter break.
Traders blamed the decline on fears of instability in the wake of
Honasan's escape.
   Florendo said the military found no evidence that foreigners
were involved in the escape. Leftist Rep. Venancio Garduce had said
Americans may have helped Honasan escape to pressure the government
as it begins talks Tuesday with the United States on the status of
its military bases here.
   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez told Philippine radio and
television stations they may lose their licenses if they broadcast
interviews with Honasan, who gave many interviews before his arrest.
   Ordonez issued the warning after the private radio station DZXL
sought permission to air a statement from Honasan hours after he
escaped. A DZXL official confirmed it had a taped statement from
Honasan but would not say what it contained.
   Ordonez said the rights of free speech and press were the
hallmarks of Philippine democracy, restored after Mrs. Aquino was
swept to power in the February 1986 civilian-military uprising that
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``However, like all other freedoms, these rights cannot be
permitted by the duly constituted government to be employed to
destroy the very government which guarantees these protections,''
he said.
   He said the policy also applied to foreign correspondents and
Philippine print media. But he gave no legal basis for including
newspapers, which do not need a license to operate.

   Four peace activists were arraigned today on
trespassing charges for allegedly attacking cruise missile housings
aboard the battleship Iowa with hammers, bolt cutters and vials of
blood.
   The protesters, part of a group touring the ship, included
veteran activist Phillip Berrigan and Gregory Boertje, a federal
fugitive for more than four months. They were arrested Sunday and
held without bond at Virginia Beach City Jail until today's
arraignment.
   U.S. Magistrate Tommy Miller set bond at $2,500, and at the
request of defense attorney Oldrick J. LaBel, continued the
protesters' appearance until April 15. At that time a trial date
will be set.
   The group picked the battleship as the target of the protest
because ``they see the Iowa as a symbol ... of super-state
madness,'' said Max Obuszewski, a spokesman for Plowshares, a peace
group founded by Berrigan eight years ago.
   Capt. Archie Galloway, a Navy spokesman, said the incident
occurred about 3:50 p.m. as a group of 10 to 15 people was being
led on a topside tour of the Iowa, which was docked at Norfolk
Naval Base.
   The four wandered away from the rest of the group ``and threw
what they claimed to be blood on two of the ship's armored box
launchers,'' which house the Tomahawk missiles, Galloway said.
   The protesters ``were immediately apprehended by Iowa crew
members,'' he said. ``There was no apparent damage to the
launchers.''
   In addition to Berrigan and Boertje, those arrested were Andrew
Lawrence and Sister Margaret McKenna. Berrigan, Boertje and
Lawrence are from Baltimore, and Sister McKenna is from Fox Chase,
Pa., a Philadelphia suburb.
   Boertje, 32, has been wanted by the FBI since he failed to show
at his Nov. 17, 1987, sentencing for his part in damaging military
aircraft at Willow Grove Naval Air Station outside Philadelphia.
   Boertje was among four Plowshares members convicted of entering
the military base Jan. 6, 1987, and smashing a P-3 Orion
anti-submarine plane and two helicopters with sledgehammers. The
government fixed damage at $165,602.
   Berrigan, 64, is a former Josephite priest. In 1980, Berrigan,
his brother, Daniel Berrigan, and six associates entered the
General Electric plant in King of Prussia, Pa., and hammered at
Mark 12-A nuclear warheads.
   The Tomahawk missile, which can carry either a conventional or
nuclear warhead, is launched from surface ships, submarines and
aircraft.

   A 9-year-old girl whose lower legs were
amputated after she was found severely frostbitten in a Gary
apartment will live with her great-grandmother after she leaves a
rehabilitation center, her father says.
   James E. Carlisle, of Fort Wayne, said he had hoped to regain
custody of his daughter, Darlwin Carlisle, but decided that he had
little chance of persuading the courts because he and his wife,
Alice, already have two small children.
   ``This is the best thing,'' Carlisle said Sunday.
   The girl's mother, Darlwin Britt, is in Lake County Jail
awaiting trial for felony child neglect.
   Carlisle said caseworkers had been working with his grandmother,
Katie M. Carlisle of Gary, the past several weeks to make sure
everything is ready for Darlwin's arrival.
   It still will be some time before Darlwin leaves La Rabida
Children's Hospital in Chicago, where she has been undergoing
rehabiliation and therapy to help her adjust to her artificial legs.
   The hospital said Saturday that a foster family had been found,
but refused to identify the family except to say they were known to
Carlisle.
   Both of her legs were amputated below the knee soon after she
was found Jan. 17, frostbitten inside a barricaded, unheated attic
apartment.
   Since Darlwin's hospitalization, Carlisle said he has tried to
visit her once a week. He has asked her several times if she wants
to see her mother.
   ``She says, `Yeah, I want to see her, but I don't want to stay
with her,''' Carlisle said. ``She says, `Next time I could lose my
arms.'''
   Ms. Britt and Carlisle were teen-agers when Darlwin was born. He
said Ms. Britt's family discouraged him from seeing his daughter
when she was young.

   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to examine the
authority of federal judges to second-guess decisions by pension
and welfare plans that deny benefits to workers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co. in a case stemming from the sale of its plastics division in
1980.
   Firestone sold the division to Occidental Petroleum Corp. The
sale affected some 500 workers at Firestone plants in Pottstown,
Pa.; West Caldwell, N.J.; Perryville and Salisbury, Md.; and Baton
Rouge, La.
   Nearly all the employees were given the opportunity to keep
their jobs under the new ownership, and most accepted.
   The workers also sought certain benefits from Firestone,
including early retirement and severance pay, that were included in
the company's pension and welfare plan.
   The company denied the benefits. It also refused to give the
workers information they requested about the benefit plan on
grounds they no longer were employed by Firestone.
   The workers sued in federal court, charging the company violated
the federal Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA).
   A judge threw out the suit on grounds that Firestone did not act
in an arbitrary and capricious manner.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the suit.
The appeals court said workers' claims must be examined more
closely in cases in which the administrator of a benefit plan is
the sole source of its funds, such as Firestone, and is not a
neutral manager.
   The appeals court also said the workers are eligible for damages
from Firestone for its refusal to provide information on benefits
even though they no longer work for Firestone.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of
Manufacturers supported Firestone's appeal to the Supreme Court.
   ``The fundamental purpose of employee benefit plan
administrators is to make benefit determinations and to manage
assets,'' the business groups said. ``It is unreasonable to assume
that Congress intended courts to second-guess plan administrators
by subjecting their decisions'' to such federal court review.
   They said there are some 750,000 pension plans run by single
employers and more than 4 million company welfare plans, most of
which are employer-administered.
   The case is Firestone vs. Bruch, 87-1054.

   Twenty years after the assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr. unleashed riots in America's black ghettos,
blacks and whites recommitted themselves to his dream of a better
life for the oppressed.
   King, gunned down as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine
Motel here, was remembered around the country in services and
speeches that urged people to carry on King's work.
   ``We've got to be concerned about one another,'' said King's
son, Martin Luther King III. ``We've got to be concerned about
helping one another.''
   A memorial service this morning at the Orpheum Theater, a
downtown landmark, was the first sponsored by the city on the
anniversary of the assassination. It was to be followed by a march
to the Lorraine Motel, where a ceremony was planned, and the start
of a three-week Southern Christian Leadership Conference march
through Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia.
   At King's tomb in Atlanta, a simple wreath-laying ceremony was
scheduled this afternoon.
   Mayor Richard Hackett, who appointed a commission to organize
Memphis' first memorial for the slain civil rights leader, said it
is time for the city where he died to better organize its efforts
to help the poor.
   ``Twenty years ago, Dr. King spoke of a dream. Today, this city
recognizes the necessity for that dream to become a reality,''
Hackett said at the memorial service. ``It is right. It is just,
and it is in the best interest of us all.''
   The memorial service included gospel singing, songs by a group
of schoolchildren and a dance, titled ``Love Has No Color,'' by
five teen-age girls dressed in gray ballet outfits.
   Nine-year-old Brian Harris, waiting to go on stage with other
schoolchildren at the Orpheum, said he was proud to take part in
the service.
   ``We should celebrate because he left us his dream,'' the
youngster said. ``He gave black people a chance to be free.''
   The day he was assassinated, King was in Memphis organizing a
strike by sanitation workers. He was shot the day after delivering
his famous ``Mountain Top'' speech at the Mason Temple.
   ``I've been to the mountain top ... and I've seen the promised
land,'' he said in his last public address. ``I may not get there
with you, but I want you to know tonight, that we as a people will
get to the promised land.''
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, asked on NBC's ``Today'' show about
the presidential campaign of Jesse Jackson, said: ``I think we see
the American people responding to a message and not to skin color.
That's what Martin lived and died for, that a man would be judged
by the content of his character, rather than the color of his
skin.''
   The search for the promised land that King talked about must
continue, Benjamin Hooks, president of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, told 500 people gathered Sunday
night at the same Mason Temple.
   ``So Dr. King, we haven't made it yet ... but we are determined
from this day, we are going to march forward and ain't nobody going
to turn us around,'' Hooks said.
   But on the anniversary of King's death, civil rights leaders
said the nation's poor are as bad off now as they were 20 years
ago, and his struggles for the racial equality and social justice
are also in need of new life.
   ``Twenty years later, everything has changed and nothing has
changed,'' said Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, a civil rights organization formed by King.
   ``We are too satisfied. We must learn some lessons from the
`60s. We must go back to some basics,'' said Ralph Abernathy, one
of King's top assistants and closest friends.
   Although progress has been made toward social equality for
blacks, the number of poor people in the nation continues to grow,
King's son said.
   ``Today, we see there are better than 36 million people living
below the level of poverty in America. In 1968, there were 26
million,'' King said.
   ``Individually we are better off, but masses of people still
suffer,'' King said. ``Daddy talked about `the least of these our
brothers and sisters' and that `least of these' continues to grow.
We have homeless people in every major city in America.''
   Meanwhile, in Portland, Ore., nearly 100 people marched Saturday
to mark King's assassination.
   ``When people gather together there is hope,'' said Ron Herndon,
co-director of Portland's Black United Front. ``The message is
there still are those who will stand up against racism.''
   King's death on April 4, 1968, sparked riots in several American
cities, including Washington, D.C., where four days of burning,
looting and violence left six people dead, 1,097 injured, 900 fires
and 6,124 arrests. The riots ended after President Johnson ordered
federal troops and 1,750 members of the D.C. National Guard into
the city.

   Guidelines for operating a pilot program to
teach farmers about commodity futures markets have been sent to
agency offices in 40 counties of 22 states, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   Participation in the Futures and Options Marketing Pilot Program
will be limited to farmers who participate in the 1988 or 1989 USDA
programs for corn, wheat or cotton, and to producers of 1988 or
1989 soybeans.
   ``Participants must attend at least one futures and options
marketing seminar presented by the Cooperative Extension Service,''
the announcement said.
   Although most of the seminars will begin this month, a few have
begun already, according to agency officials.
   The pilot program was ordered by Congress in the 1985 farm law
``to educate farmers in the use of agricultural commodity futures
and options markets as risk managment tools,'' the announcement
said.
   Guidelines for the program were sent last week to state and
county offices for release locally. Additional information will be
available in May from county offices of the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and the
Cooperative Extension Service.
   The states and counties previously designated for the pilot
program, include:
   ARIZONA _ Maricopa.
   CALIFORNIA _ Fresno, Tulare.
   GEORGIA _ Washington.
   IDAHO _ Latah.
   ILLINOIS _ Champaign, McLean, Morgan, Stark.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis stood in the muddy farmyard,
showing a group of children how to play the traditional Greek game
``cracking of eggs'' on Easter Sunday.
   ``You hold the egg up like this,'' the Massachusetts governor
told one child and then turned to another and said, ``And then you
hold your egg and tap hers. The one whose egg isn't broken at the
end is the winner.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate with a reputation
as a technocrat, is trying to warm his cool image as he struggles
to win Wisconsin's primary Tuesday and get back on track for the
nomination.
   ``I'm a guy who is passionate about cheese,'' Dukakis cracked as
he was presented with a big chunk of Wisconsin cheese at the
Danielson farm here on Sunday.
   Jesse Jackson stunned Dukakis with a sweeping 2-to-1 win in the
Michigan caucuses on March 26, rocking a campaign that was trying
to build momentum and a sense that he was the inevitable nominee.
Riding the wave out of Michigan, Jackson has drawn big crowds in
Wisconsin ahead of that state's primary on Tuesday.
   To counter Jackson _ by far the campaign's best orator _ Dukakis
has unveiled a new speech, a sharpened message of his own and a
more relaxed style on the stump.
   Emphasizing his strength as a decision-making state executive,
Dukakis in his new speech declares that he wants to be known as the
``great builder,'' not the ``great communicator'' _ a phrase often
applied to Ronald Reagan.
   ``After seven years of charisma, maybe a little competence is in
order in the White House,'' is one of Dukakis' new applause lines.
   There is also a new television ad that condemns Reagan's
economic policies and closes with Dukakis, sitting coatless in his
office, talking about what he wants to do for people.
   ``He's spent 25 years in public service making a difference in
people's lives,'' Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said in explaining
the current emphasis of the campaign.
   Jackson's major pitch _ that he has stood with the workers and
the farmers in their hours of crisis _ has been a compelling one.
   Dukakis has tried to counter that in both public and private
meetings by explaining his use of a Massachusetts plant-closing law
to save jobs and his efforts to save a big General Motors plant in
Massachusetts. Chrysler's decision to close a plant in Kenosha has
been a target for all the Democratic candidates.
   But substance is not the only way to woo voters. Image and style
are key elements that the Dukakis campaign has not ignored.
   In recent days, Dukakis has donned an apron to serve food to
senior citizens and at an Easter supper at a Greek Orthodox church.
He went to the Danielson's barn to be photographed watching as cows
were milked in this state with a big dairy industry.
   ``It's also about rolling up your sleeves and working hard for
votes,'' Dach added.
   Dukakis has his own explanation for the change. After a long day
of campaigning Sunday, he mused on the chartered plane that
``spending so much time in Iowa, talking to small groups of people
who are passionately interested in this one issue'' made him aware
that retail politics ``are at heart of what we are doing.''
   The Massachusetts governor opens his stump speeches with digs at
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who said last week he would vote for
Jackson if he were a Democrat.
   The Dukakis campaign is deeply worried about such a crossover
vote in this open-primary state. But Dukakis makes light of that,
saying he sent the Republican governor a note thanking him for
making it clear that George Bush does not want to run against
Dukakis in the fall. Then he adds:
   ``Tommy really got excited the other day, according to the
newspapers. He was introducing the vice president in Waukesha and
he said, `It's time for the Bush pregnancy to begin.'
   ``I'll drink to that,'' Dukakis says. ``I'll drink to that.''
   Several times before union or blue-collar crowds, Dukakis has
used a mild expletive. That is something friends say the candidate
does occasionally in private, but it has rarely been heard before
in the carefully watched appearances on the campaign trail.
   ``Hell, I'm the only candidate in this race who has ever
balanced a budget,'' he said at one point.
   Boasting about the benefits of full employment, Dukakis added:
``Hell, they are paying six bucks an hour in McDonalds in my state,
because they can't get people.''

   Superconductivity expert C.W. Paul Chu said
Monday he will remain at the University of Houston after rejecting
an offer to move to the University of California at Berkeley.
   Chu called the decision one of the most difficult of his life
and said he had been torn between his loyalty to Houston and his
desire to be at Berkeley, ``as it has been a personal goal to join
the Berkeley faculty.''
   In a statement, Chu said ``developing the superconductivity
effort at UH is a great responsibility. One that has been made
easier thanks to the support of the university, foundations,
industry and city, state and federal government.''
   Berkeley's effort to land Chu highlighted the pressure on
developers of higher-termperature superconductors, which transmit
electricity without resistance.
   Previously, superconductors worked only at temperatures near
absolute zero, or about minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit.
Higher-temperature devices could revolutionize electrical
transmission, computers, trains and many other electrical devices,
scientists say.
   Chu ``has built up a group there (in Houston) and he feels
responsible to them,'' said Berkeley physicist Marvin L. Cohen. Chu
also may have considered the career of his wife Mary, a vice
president of a Houston bank, he added.

   Princess Anne got a bloody nose Monday
when the horse she was riding in a steeplechase race made a mistake
at the first fence and conked her face with its head.
   ``The princess took a knock when her horse made a hash of the

``It was a good performance and the horse ran on well.''
   The 37-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and her horse

   Kenneth O'Dowd, cousin of pop singer Boy George,
appeared in court Monday accused of trying to kill a man with a
shotgun.
   A magistrate ordered the 41-year-old O'Dowd, who sported a black
eye, to be held without bail until a hearing Tuesday.
   O'Dowd, an interior decorator, was arrested and charged Sunday
with attempted murder relating to a shooting incident March 23 in
south London and with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger
life.
   Police would not disclose any details of the shooting incident.
   Police said they had been seeking to arrest O'Dowd when a woman
they declined to identify called Sunday to say she had been arguing
with him at an apartment in south London and that he was armed with
a shotgun.
   Police laid siege to the building and arrested O'Dowd four hours
later after breaking down the apartment door, a spokeswoman said.
There weren't any hostages; two women whom police declined to
identify left the apartment before officers arrived, the
spokeswoman said.

   Auto heir John Dodge, who began a
one-year prison sentence for violating his probation on drug
charges over the weekend, says he doesn't consider himself a
criminal.
   Dodge, who turned himself in to the Palm Beach County Jail late
Friday, said prison ``is something I have to go through and I
choose to look at it positively.''
   The 34-year-old Palm Beach man, youngest grandson of auto tycoon
Horace Dodge Sr., was first arrested in March 1985 and charged with
10 counts of forging prescriptions to buy Dilaudid, a synthetic
drug similar to heroin.
   He was put on probation but arrested again in September 1986
after police watched him take drugs from a safe-deposit box he
shared with his pharmacist girlfriend.
   In January, a judge sentenced Dodge to one year in prison but
postponed the sentence until April 1 so Dodge could attend custody
hearings over his 6-year-old son, John Dodge Jr. On March 23, Dodge
agreed to give up custody of his son.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to review
rulings limiting Korean Air Lines' financial liability for a 1983
disaster in which 269 people died _ the shooting down of a KAL
passenger jet over Soviet airspace.
   The justices said they will study arguments that the airline
should have to face more than $75,000 in damages for each death.
   KAL Flight 7, en route from New York City to Seoul, Korea, was
shot down by a Soviet military airplane Sept. 1, 1983 after flying
more than 300 miles off course and entering Soviet airspace over
the Sea of Japan.
   One of the 61 Americans killed was Democratic Rep. Lawrence
McDonald of Georgia.
   Many of the victims' families, including McDonald's widow, sued
KAL in various federal courts. The wrongful-death lawsuits were
consolidated and presented to a federal trial judge here.
   Lawyers for the victims' families in 1984 asked U.S. District
Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. to declare that KAL was not eligible
for the $75,000-per-death liability cap imposed by the Warsaw
Convention and the Montreal Agreement, treaties covering
international airline travel.
   The treaties specify that passenger tickets must tell of the
$75,000 limit warning in lettering no smaller than 10-point print.
The KAL tickets told of the liability limit in slightly smaller,
8-point print.
   Judge Robinson ruled that the $75,000 limit applied to the KAL
disaster, and his decision was upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here last Sept. 25.
   The appeals court ruling conflicts with a decision by the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stemming from a 1982 airline crash in
Kenner, La., that killed 154 people.
   The 5th Circuit court upheld $720,000 in wrongful-death awards
won by the families of five Uruguayans who were among the victims
on Pan Am Flight 759, which crashed outside New Orleans shortly
after takeoff July 9, 1982.
   Pan Am was barred from benefiting from the $75,000-per-death
limit because the limit was discussed on its tickets in 9-point
rather than 10-point print.
   The case is In Re KAL Disaster, 87-1055.

<HEAD>Protestants March, Vow to Fight United Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANBRIDGE, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Protestants
waving British flags marched Monday to mark a 299-year-old victory
over Roman Catholics and vowed to oppose forever a
Catholic-dominated united Ireland.
   The Protestant parades followed Sunday's peaceful marches across
the province by Catholics commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising
against British rule in what is now the Republic of Ireland.
   Led by 40 fife-and-drum bands, the pro-British Apprentice Boys
parades marched peacefully in a carnival-like atmosphere to
commemorate Protestant resistance to the 1689 siege of Londonderry
ordered by England's Catholic King James II.
   The Apprentice Boys take their name from 12 apprentices said to
have slammed Londonderry's gates on James' army at the start of the
unsuccessful 105-day siege.
   Hardline Protestant lawmaker Peter Robinson told several hundred
marchers at Dundonald on the outskirts of Belfast that the Irish
Republican Army was planning an all-out war against Protestants.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic.
   Robinson said that over the past few months the IRA has brought
into Ireland arms ``more powerful and sophisticated'' than ever
used before.
   ``However, the loyalist (Protestant) community will band itself
together and make it clear to the IRA that while it may be
victorious in the atrocities it carries out, the final victory will
go to those who have endured the most,'' he said.
   Leaders of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the IRA,
dashed any hopes Sunday of a cease-fire.
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said he expected talks to
continue with the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor
Party on an overall strategy ``for justice and peace'' in the
strife-torn province, where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2.
   But Sinn Fein Vice President Martin McGuinness stressed the IRA
has gone on record as saying there will be no more cease-fires.
``Talk (can) take place but the war will go on,'' he said.
   John Hume, leader of the Social Democrats, said he intends to
pursue his party's dialogue with Sinn Fein despite their opposition
to any cease-fire until Britain announces its withdrawal from the
province.
   ``Nobody should be surprised that Sinn Fein have a very
different approach from us at the beginning, because if we had the
same approach, there would be no need for dialogue,'' Hume was
quoted Monday as telling The Irish Times.
   Party Chairman Alban Maginness told BBC Radio Ulster the talks
are concerned with much broader issues than arranging a cease-fire.
   ``We are concerned with establishing the conditions whereby
there will be a total, permanent end of all violence,'' he said.
   The meetings have sparked speculation that talks including
Protestants as well as Catholics might be the next step.
   But Robinson, a key figure in Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic
Unionist Party, one of the province's two main Protestant parties,
ruled out participation in such talks. He said he remained
vehemently opposed to any formula to solve Northern Ireland's
problems based on the Anglo-Irish agreement.
   The 1985 accord gives the Irish Republic a consultative role in
the administration of Northern Ireland, which Robinson and many
Protestants view as the first step to a united, Catholic-run
Ireland.
   ``No way will unionist (Protestant) leaders sit down and talk to
the mouthpiece of the IRA, Gerry Adams,'' Robinson said.
   At the largest Protestant march in Banbridge, 25 miles southwest
of Belfast, several thousand people stood in silence for one minute
in memory of members of the security forces killed in the sectarian
violence, the 11 people who died in a November IRA bombing at a war
memorial in Enniskillen, and two British soldiers killed March 19.

   Cockroaches from these parts are setting
race records at a small Quaker college in Indiana.
   For the past two years, Louisiana contenders have taken two of
the top three places in the Bundy 500 race, named for the Earlham
College dormitory where it takes place and the Indianapolis car
race.
   The roaches started moving north from this southeastern Lousiana
area in 1986 when a local dentist began shipping them to his
daughter, Marcy Wood, 19, then a freshman at the Richmond, Ind.,
college.
   ``We have steam tunnels that run all under the campus. That's
where most people catch their roaches,'' said Wood, 19, of the
Slidell area.
   Egged on by a friend who had raced the local steam-tunnel
variety, Wood called her father about importing a few ringers.
   ``She said, `These are little, tiny roaches. They're nothing
like we have in Louisiana,''' recalled William H. Wood.
   He used peppermint candy to lure roaches onto the deck of his
home, which backs up to swampland. He packed them with leaves,
grass and straw in a plastic wine jug with air holes and mailed it
to his daughter.
   Shipments for her friends for next year's race may not be
necessary, Miss Wood said.
   ``One of them this year let a roach go down in the steam
tunnel,'' she said. ``So we're breeding Louisiana roaches in
Indiana.''

   The jump in postal rates brought bargain hunters
out in force to take advantage of their last chance at mailing
22-cent first-class letters.
   Officials said letters that show up Monday with 22 cent stamps
will probably get a day of amnesty because of the cost of returning
them all to senders.
   ``It's just not feasible to do something like that,'' said
Central Square Superintendent Edmund Powers.
   On Saturday, Barbara Lillie of Newton Corner brought 15 letters
to the Newtonville post office.
   ``That's why all my mail is going out today, even a few things
that can wait until later,'' she said.
   Lillie said the small-scale thrift while paying her bills made
her feel good, like ``going to the supermarket with your coupons
and saving 20 cents, or whatever.''
   There also were plenty of people buying the new 25 cent stamps
or 3 centers to supplement leftover stocks of the old 22s.
   ``It was really busy,'' said Carolyn LaFee, a clerk at the
Central Square post office in Cambridge.

   Three years ago, Marilyn Doane knew little
about a business that has made her overseer of 42,000 fish.
   The 38-year-old woman is raising trout and selling about 3,000 a
month. She supplies the fish to 35 commercial customers, including
area supermarkets, restaurants, country clubs and fish stores.
   ``It's potential is almost beyond what I can imagine,'' said
Doane, who worked as a carpenter before turning to fish. She
started out with 1,000 fingerlings a couple of years ago on the
30-acre farm she and her husband own just north of Grand Rapids.
   She had a big setback shortly after she began. Torrential rains
in September 1986 caused a dam to burst a mile upstream on the
Rogue River and flooded the ponds.
   ``We lost 6,000 fish,'' she said, and the survivors mingled with
other fish. ``It took me three weeks to sort them all out.''
   Doane is putting in more ponds and building an addition to her
house for more efficient fish processing.
   ``It turned around in January; I made $6,'' Doane said proudly.

<HEAD>Exiled Stage Director Invited to Return and Open Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled stage director Yuri Lyubimov will return in
May to the Taganka Theater he founded to preside over the opening
of a production he was working on before he was fired and
dishonored four years ago.
   The Taganka's deputy director, Alexander M. Yefimovich,
confirmed the 70-year-old impresario had accepted an invitation
from the theater to come to Moscow and open ``Boris Godunov,'' his
drama about the troubled eight-year reign of the Russian czar who
died in 1605.
   Yefimovich said he did not know how long Lyubimov would be in
Moscow to put the final touches on the play before opening night,
but he made clear that the popular director would be coming for a
working visit rather than returning for permanent residence.
   ``As far as I know it won't be a long visit,'' Yefimovich said.
   Lyubimov, 70, was working in Europe and could not immediately be
reached for comment on his reported plans to return to his native
country for the first time in almost five years.
   He became an Israeli citizen this year and lives with his wife,
Katalin, and son, Peter, in Jerusalem. He has been staging
productions around the world since his departure from Moscow in
July 1983.
   When Lyubimov departed to bring Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and
Punishment'' to London, cultural figures speculated he would not be
allowed to return. That he was allowed to take his family with him
on the trip indicated he was not expected to return.
   Under Lyubimov, the Taganka Theater became famous for its
avant-garde productions and controversial themes, and he battled
with censors throughout much of his career in Moscow.
   Lyubimov extended his stay in London, demanding assurances that
he would be allowed artistic freedom once back in the Soviet Union.
In March 1984, he was fired from the Taganka and expelled from the
Communist Party.
   His name was rarely mentioned in the Soviet press until last
week, when the government daily newspaper Izvestia carried an
interview with him in Madrid, where the Taganka company was staging
Maxim Gorky's ``Mother.''
   Izvestia quoted Lyubimov as saying he would like to return to
work in the Soviet Union if conditions were favorable, but said he
was making no political demands.
   ``In order to once again gain strength, survive, one needs to
stand on his native land, on which he was raised, where his fathers
and grandfathers lived,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The director praised the more open literature that is being
published under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, and
said, ``it is necessary to come, to see, and to work in the
theater.''
   In March 1987, Lyubimov and a group of other exiled scientists
and artists wrote an open letter expressing their doubts about
Gorbachev's reform program and calling the Soviet Union a ``gravely
sick country.''
   The letter was printed by the Moscow News, and the writers were
criticized bitterly in the official media, which accused them of
wishing evil on their native land.
   Lyubimov denied having ill motives and has said in interviews
while working abroad that he concentrated on productions that would
acquaint the world with the best of Russian culture. He staged
``Crime and Punishment'' at Washington's Arena Stage last year.
   This week's edition of Moscow News also carried an article about
the Taganka and the company's meeting with Lyubimov in Madrid,
where he viewed ``Mother'' four times.
   Moscow News said Lyubimov planned to visit Moscow for the
opening of ``Boris Godunov'' in May, but gave no details.
   Referring to the freer hand allowed in the arts under Gorbachev,
the newspaper commented, ``Now we can afford to be generous and
noble'' in overcoming the excesses of the past.

<HEAD>Carlucci Meets With Indians on Defense, Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
held talks Monday with Indian officials on Afghanistan and on
expanding U.S.-Indian defense cooperation, a Defense Ministry
official said.
   ``The general focus was on bilateral cooperation in matters of
defense _ research, production and development,'' said the
official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Carlucci met with Defense Minister K.S. Pant and the chiefs of
the Indian army, air force and navy. Foreign Secretary K.P.S. Menon
attended one session, the official said.
   India is seeking U.S. technology for a light combat aircraft it
is developing. It also has been seeking some specialized military
equipment, such as radar systems.
   As Carlucci's meetings were going on, a fire broke out several
miles away at the American cultural center in New Delhi. There were
no injuries.
   The fire was an accident that had ``absolutely no connection''
with Carlucci's visit, said Douglas Rose, deputy director of the
U.S. Information Service in New Delhi.
   The fire began on the fifth floor, the building's top story,
after sparks from a welder's torch ignited flammable gas canisters
stored there, said S.K. Dheri, the city's chief fire officer.
   About 150 firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at the
American Center, which houses U.S. Information Service offices, a
library, theater, meeting rooms and a media center, Dheri said.
   Damage was estimated at between $100,000 and $300,000, said
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in Washington.
   It was Carlucci's first visit to India. He was scheduled to
visit military installations near Bombay on Tuesday before meeting
with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He was to leave Wednesday for
Pakistan.
   The United News of India said that during Carlucci's talks,
``the question of the United States reducing its arms supplies to
Pakistan following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan also came
up for a review.'' It did not elaborate.

   Gov. Evan Mecham broke the law and lied
about it to the state Senate, a prosecutor said today in urging the
Senate to convict the impeached first-term Republican and remove
him from office.
   Prosecutor William French said in closing arguments that Mecham
broke the law in borrowing $80,000 from the governor's protocol
fund for his auto dealership.
   ``He has violated the law ... He has uttered untruths to you,''
French said.
   Earlier, prosecutor Paul Eckstein accused Mecham of showing ``a
lifetime of reckless disregard for the reputation of anyne who has
stood in his path to political power.''
   ``Respondent (Mecham) has demonstrated for all the world to see
his plain inability to tell the truth,' Eckstein said. ``How much
proof is required to demonstrate that respondent puffed,
exaggerated, misremembered, dissembled and out-and-out lied.''
   Eckstein said Mecham's conduct in office ``was not just
offensive, it was grossly offensive.''
   Senators must decide whether to convict Mecham on two
impeachment charges issued by the Arizona House. A third charge was
dismissed. A vote could come late today or Tuesday, climaxing five
weeks of trial, lawmakers said. A conviction would force the
first-term Republican out of office.
   The first impeachment count accuses the governor of trying to
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official. Mecham contended he did not intend to beak the law and
that he was not fully informed of the seriousness of the alleged
threat.
   ``Ignorance of the law is no defense,'' Eckstein told senators.
   But Mecham's defense lawyer, Fred Craft, told senators, ``You're
being asked to politically assassinate the governor.''
   ``He doesn't resign (as Mecham has been urged to) because he's
not guilty of these charges,'' Craft said. ``He dares to right city
hall and he's doing it at great cost to himself.''
   Craft said in his closing argument that the allegation was based
on a 90-second conversation with Department of Public Safety
Director Ralph Milstead. Craft accused prosecutors of seeking to
``twist and torture it in such a way that it accounts for an
obstruction of justice.''
   As closing arguments proceeded, a trumpeter played ``Taps''
outside the Senate building as a group of men carried a mock coffin
labeled, ``Herein Lies the Right to an Elected Governor.''
   The prosecutor accused Mecham of making a number of statements
during his Senate testimony that ``are either wrong'' or were
contradicted by other witnesses.
   Among the examples cited by Eckstein was the governor's
testimony, recanted a day later, that his former chief bodyguard
had stolen a report from the governor's office.
   Nonetheless, Eckstein said, Mecham and Department of Public
Safety Director Ralph Milstead gave ``remarkably similar'' accounts
of their Nov. 15 conversation in which Mecham allegedly ordered
Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation
of the alleged threat.
   Mecham admitted in Senate testimony that he told Milstead, ``The
attorney general is out to get me and I'm not going to help him in
any way.''
   Mecham sat at the defense table during closing arguments. When
he arrived at the Capitol, he was cheered by a group of
well-wishers as he walked into the Senate building behind
bodyguards. He said nothing but smiled and flashed a thumbs-up
signal at the crowd.
   Mecham, 63, who took office in January 1987, has maintained he
is innocent of wrongdoing. He also is accused of misusing $80,000
from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership.
   Last week the Senate dismissed a third charge that Mecham
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, the subject of the governor's
April 21 criminal trial. Some senators said hearing testimony on
that allegation could have prejudiced his criminal trial.
   However, Democrats acknowledged that the real reason they
favored dismissing the charge was to ensure a Senate trial verdict
well before the scheduled May 17 gubernatorial recall election.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required for
conviction. Lawmakers also could bar Mecham from holding any future
public office. If convicted, Mecham would become the seventh U.S.
governor removed from office by impeachment.
   The prosecution contends the governor's protocol fund _ created
with inaugural ball proceeds _ was a public fund and that Mecham
Pontiac needed the $80,000 loan to meet its July 1987 payroll.
   However, the defense said the fund was private money and that
the loan was intended merely to provide a higher interest rate for
the fund. Mecham Pontiac was in good financial shape and could have
borrowed the money elsewhere, according to testimony by the
governor's son, Dennis, who is general manager of the dealership.
   But the day after he testified last week, Dennis Mecham
announced the dealership was being sold. Sales had suffered due to
the ``avalanche of negative publicity'' about the governor, he said.
   The allegation regarding the death threat has boiled down to
Mecham's word against that of Department of Public Safety Director
Ralph Milstead. He testified that Mecham ordered him not to
cooperate with the attorney general's investigation of the alleged
threat by state official Lee Watkins against former top Mecham aide
Donna Carlson.
   At the time of the alleged threat in November, Ms. Carlson was
about to testify before the state grand jury regarding the $350,000
campaign loan.
   Senators, meanwhile, said they knew how important the
impeachment vote will be.
   If the governor is allowed to return to his job, ``I think
there'll be terrible chaos in state government,'' said Minority
Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat.
   Lawmakers' own careers also may hang in the balance, some
senators said.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. attacked corporations and
touted newspaper endorsements while Sen. Paul Simon spoke on behalf
of underdogs, including himself, in television ads aimed at those
who will vote Tuesday in Wisconsin's Democratic presidential
primary.
   The airwaves also carried ads placed by Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, but Gore of Tennessee and Simon
of Illinois, with much at stake in Wisconsin, appeared to be the
big spenders.
   Gore's campaign refused to disclose the size of his media
campaign but others estimated it at more than $250,000. A Simon
spokesman said the Illinois senator bought $150,000 of media time.
   Dukakis, with a slight edge over Jackson in recent polls in
Wisconsin, was investing about $115,000, a spokesman said. Jackson
had spent $50,000 on media, including $9,000 for radio, his
campaign said.
   Gore ran six TV spots in Wisconsin including five new ones. Many
of the ads were highly critical of corporate America.
   One of the spots being aired Monday night quoted from editorials
in which Gore was endorsed by The Milwaukee Journal and The
Milwaukee Sentinel.
   In another ad, a shirt-sleeved Gore tells a town meeting in
Wisconsin, ``We should encourage American companies to invest more
here in the United States and create more jobs here for a change.''
A narrator says: ``He's always stood up for working people and
against the rich and powerful.''
   Gore, like most of the other candidates, took on the Chrysler
Corp., which has announced it plans to close its automaking plant
in Kenosha, Wis. In an ad, he says the company was leaving
employees ``without jobs or hope. And it's happening all over, not
just in Wisconsin. I'll make the corporations pay their share of
taxes. ... Let's make them put people over profits.''
   Simon ran two new TV ads in Wisconsin, including one he wrote in
which he recalls his grandparents' Wisconsin dairy farm and talks
about the problems of workers, senior citizens and children.
   ``We're in this together, one family,'' Simon says. ``When any
of us hurt, all of us hurt. Tuesday you can launch an underdog who
fights for underdogs.''
   The second ad for Simon, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, cites his experience on foreign policy matters.
   Jackson ran three spots in Wisconsin _ two new ones plus an
earlier one containing an endorsement by entertainer Bill Cosby.
The ads showed Jackson at a rally with workers at the Kenosha
Chrysler plant and a farmer saying Jackson saved his farm.
   Dukakis used a total of five ads in Wisconsin, including a
biography and an endorsement by former House Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill Jr., D-Mass. As primary day neared, he was running
two ads, one of them an attack on ``Republican indifference'' to
the plight of the homeless and the unemployed. The newly produced
spot began Friday on Wisconsin television stations.
   The other Dukakis ad, which has been used elsewhere, stresses
the governor's experience as a chief executive balancing budgets
and making decisions.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot a
Palestinian dead and wounded eight on Monday, a day of strike and
protest in the occupied lands against the peace mission by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   A Palestinian died in the Gaza Strip of wounds suffered last
week.
   At least 138 Arabs have been killed since violence began Dec. 8
in the West Bank and Gaza, according to U.N. figures. An Israeli
soldier also has died.
   Talks between Shultz and Israeli leaders focused on the U.S.
proposal for Palestinian self-rule rather than how to arrange an
international conference.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opposes such a forum, but Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres said: ``The international conference is just
a door that will be opened.'' Peres, the prime minister's political
rival and partner in the coaltiion government, supports a
conference.
   He told reporters in Haifa: ``The question is what are we going
to discuss after it (the conference) is opened. Maybe the more we
go into details, the less threatening it will be for Shamir.''
   Shamir says Israel would be outnumbered at such a conference and
risk having decisions imposed upon it.
   Shultz pledge the United States to oppose a Palestinian state
and efforts to force Israel to give up all territory in the West
Bank and Gaza, which it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Prominent Palestinians the United States had seen as potential
negotiating partners closed ranks against Shultz. They accused him
of siding with Israel and refused to meet with him.
   The boycott of Shultz and the general strike were designed to
underline Arab demands to be represented by the Palestine
Liberation Organization at any peace talks.
   Authorities stationed 600 policemen in Jerusalem's walled Old
City to prevent clashes between Moslems and militant Jews trying to
pray at the Al Aqsa Mosque complex, one of Islam's holiest shrines.
   Police turned away the 50 Jews, who carried a banner reading
``The Temple Mount, the national symbol of our people, is in the
hands of our enemies.'' The hill, called Haram es-Sharif in Arabic,
is sacred to both Moslems and Jews.
   Stores were closed and streets nearly deserted in the occupied
territories because of an order by the underground Palestinian
leadership for a strike and two days of protest.
   Anti-Shultz graffiti spray-painted on walls in Ramallah said
``The PLO refuses the Shultz solution'' and ``Down with the Shultz
solution.''
   Abu Jebrin sold bread from cardboard boxes at a street stand in
the West Bank city across from his bakery, which he said soldiers
forced him to close. Bakeries are exempted from PLO strike calls.
   In Gaza City, outlawed Palestinian flags flew from rooftops and
utility poles. Rashad al Shawaa, a former mayor dismissed by the
Israelis, said electricity was cut off in the city. The army denied
it was done as punishment.
   Bethlehem, usually bustling with pilgrims at Easter, was like a
ghost town. A lone tourist was seen on the streets at midday.
   A dozen Arab boys hurled stones at soldiers deployed near the
main road, and 400 Bethlehem residents marched through town to
protest the killing of a young Arab by soldiers over the weekend.
   In Bani Naim, a West Bank village 20 miles south of Jerusalem,
soldiers killed one Palestinian and wounded seven, doctors at
nearby Alia Hospital reported. Israel radio said youths attacked
soldiers during an anti-Shultz demonstration.
   Reporters bound for Hebron were turned back at an army roadblock
near Arrub, a West Bank refugee camp Arrub 12 miles south of
Jerusalem. Army officials later said the area was closed to
journalists because their presence might provoke protests.
   At Balata, a refugee camp in the northern West Bank, soldiers
shot an 18-year-old Arab in the right thigh, said Nablus hospital
officials. The army said a border policeman fired after being
attacked with an axe, and soldiers put Balata under curfew.
   Newspaper reports said Israeli soldiers ordered Arab motorists
to remove a roadblock in the West Bank town El Bireh, then forced
them to bury truck driver Anwar Mohammed Sharawneh, under a pile of
rocks.
   The Communist Party paper Ittihad said soldiers beat Sharawneh,
24, before the burial and he was rescued by other Arabs but did not
seek hospital treatment for fear of arrest. It quoted relatives who
were not named.
   Another paper, Hadashot, quoted Palestinian sources as Sharawneh
was buried under more than 100 pounds of stones. Army officials
said the incident was hard to investigate because no complaint was
filed and Sharawneh could not be located.

   Leaders of the nation's capital on Monday
marked the rebirth of neighborhoods that were reduced to rubble 20
years ago by the riots that followed the assassination of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``This is a difficult day for all of us,'' said Mayor Marion
Barry Jr., standing in front of a year-old, $50 million city
government building constructed on the streetcorner where the riots
began. ``We're here today to rededicate ourselves to finishing the
agenda Dr. King began.''
   Barry, who ran a job-training program for Washington's
inner-city youth in 1968, said King's assassination led him to
believe that civil rights progress _ and neighborhood
reconstruction _ would come faster.
   ``Many are frustrated that we are celebrating changes that have
come all too slowly,'' Barry said. ``We haven't seen the rapid
reinvestment in neighborhoods that we expected, but we have seen
some progress.''
   The new government center at which he spoke is one example of
change, but buildings just across the street remain the burned-out
shells they were after three days of rioting turned the capital
into a city under siege.
   Some sections of other neighborhoods have seen very little
rebuilding, and Barry blamed the slow reconstruction pace on a lack
of promised federal and private financing.
   The rioting laid waste to vast tracts of three largely black
neighborhoods, as the homes of black residents and the stores of
white merchants burned and businesses were looted.
   The numbers associated with the riots are staggering: More than
1,200 homes and businesses were burned, with property damage
conservatively estimated at $24.7 million. More than 7,600 people
were arrested, most for looting; and 12 people were killed, most
when trapped in burning buildings.
   Hospitals treated more than 1,200 injuries. More than 11,500
federal troops reinforced the 2,800-member District of Columbia
police department to quell the disturbances.
   By the time order was restored, nearly 25 percent of the city's
then-population of 810,000 needed some form of assistance.
   Reflecting on the outpouring of anger and violence following
King's death, some city leaders still seem startled by the
vehemence of the protest.
   ``When the riots got started, it caught everyone by surprise,''
said Sam Jordan, a city official who lived a block from where the
riots started, about two miles north of the White House.
   ``The tension was there, but we had followed Dr. King's
philosophy of non-violence. When he was assassinated, the anger
came out.''
   David Clarke, the District of Columbia Council chairman, thinks
it wrong that some think of the riots and King at the same time.
   Calling King's philosophy and the riots ``moral antitheses,''
Clarke said progress in Washington since 1968 is ``not the result
of a riot. It is the result of a movement.''
   Many of Washington's political leaders were active in the civil
rights movement, and worked for changes on both the local and
national level following King's death.
   An elective school board replaced a federally appointed panel in
1968, and Washington residents earned the right to elect their own
mayor and city council in 1974.
   ``The (civil rights) movement was the major source of strength
for our evolving lives,'' Barry said. ``We worked hard, we lived
hard. Always, Dr. King was a great inspiration to all of us.''

<HEAD>Many Imported Aerosol Cans Contained Banned Propellant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-three percent of imported aerosol
cosmetics contained chlorofluorocarbon compounds banned as
propellants by the United States 10 years ago, the Customs Service
said Monday.
   The non-compliance rate is below some spot checks in the past,
according to Don Cousins, chief of the technical branch in the
Office of Technical Services in the Customs Service. The figure has
been as high as 60 percent, he said.
   Customs has never before undertaken anything like the current
checks in ``Operation Ozone,'' which spokesman Dennis Shimkoski
said constituted ``pretty near 100 percent'' of all pending imports.
   The service checked 442 samples of aerosol products since Feb.
15, said Shimkoski. Of those, 188 contained the offending compounds.
   More than 60 different products were represented in the samples.
Shimkoski said most were perfumes made in France, but deodorants,
baby powders and shaving creams also were found.
   Shimkoski said the hunch of the service was that most of the
shipments were not sent to the United States by the manufacturers,
but by middlemen ``who saw a good deal on something.''
   The aerosol cosmetics were held up during the lab tests, and
those that flunked could be seized by the service or returned to
the shipper, said Shimkoski. He said he did not have figures on how
often each course had been followed.
   The United States banned almost all use of chlorofluorocarbon,
or CFC, compounds as aerosol propellants in 1978 out of concern
that they might be attacking the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high
that shields the Earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun.
   The 1978 U.S. aerosol ban, joined only by Canada and some of the
Scandinavian countries, was the first action anywhere against CFCs.
It was followed by temporary declines in CFC use and inactivity on
almost every front except research.
   More recently, scientists concluded that CFCs most likely are
responsible for unexplained ozone declines at northern
mid-latitudes ranging from 1.7 percent to 3.0 percent, according to
a March 15 report from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, and also the halving of ozone over the South Pole
in the spring.
   Less ozone means more ultraviolet reaching the ground and more
skin cancer. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that
a 1 percent decline in ozone means an eventual increase of 4.8
percent to 7.5 percent in the most common form of skin cancer.
   Last September's treaty by major producing nations to cut CFC
emissions by 50 percent by 1998 means other countries probably will
make action against aerosols their first step, industry analysts
have said.
   About 35 percent of CFCs used outside the United States are used
for aerosols, EPA has estimated. Some 5 percent of U.S. use is
devoted to aerosols, mostly in medical applications for which their
is no good substitute.
   CFCs, valued for being non-toxic and non-flammable, are also
used as cleaning solvents in electronics manufacture, plastic foam
blowing agents and as refrigeration fluids.
   They were largely replaced in U.S. aerosols by flammable
hydrocarbon compounds, which can slightly promote the formation of
ozone at ground level where it is a pollutant.

   Ethiopia and Somalia, which fought
a full-scale war 11 years ago, agreed to restore diplomatic
relations and discuss border disputes dating back more than a
century, Ethiopia's foreign minister said Monday.
   Berhanu Bahiy released details of a 10-point agreement worked
out between the East African neighbors during the weekend by an
Ethiopian delegation he led and a Somali delegation led by Deputy
Prime Minister Ahmed Mohamoud Farah.
   Under the agreement, the two sides will ``refrain from the use
of threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or
political independence'' of the other.
   The two sides also would move their forces back at least six to
nine miles from the border. The withdrawal is to begin by April 15
and to be completed by May 15 under the supervision of a joint
military committee.
   Both sides agreed to exchange prisoners of war within four
months and ``to prevent all acts of destabilization and subversive
activities against each other.'' Somalia and Ethiopia have
supported and harbored rebels opposed to the other's government.
   Ethiopia's central government has fought long wars with
separatists in its northernmost regions of Eritrea and Tigray.
Rebels in both regions last week claimed major victories, prompting
President Mengistu Haile Mairiam to comment publicly on the
problems for the first time in his 13-year rule.
   Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre's government also is
fighting insurgencies.
   Any lessening of tension between Ethiopia and Somalia would free
troops from the border for redeployment to areas of rebel activity.
   In 1977-78, Ethiopia and Somalia went to war after Somalia
invaded the Ogaden, a semi-arid region of eastern Ethiopia
populated by ethnic Somalis.
   Previously, Ethiopia had insisted that the border question be
included in the agenda, but Somalia proposed that the two sides
first restore relations and take other steps before tackling the
question separately.
   Berhanu said the boundary question would be discussed later, but
said no date had been set.
   The agreement was signed after talks Friday and Saturday in
Mogadishu, the Somali capital. It is based on a March 30, 1964,
pact known as the Khartoum Agreement.
   The 1964 agreement, which took its name from the Sudanese
capital where it was signed, was never honored by either side.
   The 1977 invasion by Somalia, then backed by Moscow, sparked a
war that ended a year later when Ethiopia's Marxist government
routed the invaders and pushed them back across the border. By
then, Ethiopia had millions of dollars in weapons from its new
backer, the Soviet Union, and help from Cuban troops.
   Ethiopia had been one of the West's staunchest African friends
before Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a 1974 revolution.
But Moscow's switch put Addis Ababa firmly in the Soviet camp.
   Somalia then sought and received U.S. backing.
   Ethiopia has the largest military force in black Africa, but the
conflict with Somalia has been a stalemate since the 1977 war
despite a technical state of war and some border clashes.

<HEAD>Colombians Propose Truce With Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading Colombians are proposing that
the government negotiate a truce with drug traffickers who have
killed 21 judges and scores of other people in the last four years.
   So far, the government of President Virgilio Barco, a close
friend of the United States, has vowed to keep on fighting the drug
traffickers.
   But many Colombians, including the attorney general and two
Roman Catholic bishops, have called for a truce because the United
States is not doing enough to help stop the illicit trade.
   The U.S. government gave $14 million to Colombia last year to
fight drug trafficking.
   In addition to the judges, drug traffickers have killed two
newspaper editors, a justice minister, an attorney general and
scores of policemen and soldiers.
   After traffickers killed Attorney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos in
February for his battle against drug trafficking, Barco said his
government would not be intimidated by the gangsters.
   Two bishops, Dario Castrillon of Pereira and Samuel Silverio
Buitrago of Popayan said in February that the Colombian government
should start talks with the drug traffickers.
   ``Recalling the words of President Nixon, all war is
political,'' Castrillon said. ``We have to look for ... dialogue in
order to avoid war.''
   Silverio said drug money could be used to help the poor. ``You
might as well try to cover up the sun with your hands as deny that
the economy has not been helped by drug trafficking,'' Silverio
said.
   Attorney General Alfredo Gutierrez Marquez reiterated in a
broadcast interview Monday that he would not object if the
government opened talks with drug traffickers.
   Gutierrez turned in his resignation last week after a news
report that showed his brother had bought a farm and an airstrip
from a drug trafficker and that a drug trafficker's plane had
landed there.
   The president accepted the resignation. Gutierrez will stay in
office until his replacement is appointed. There have been no
reports linking Gutierrez himself with drugs.
   The mayor-elect of Medellin, Juan Gomez Martinez, said last week
the government should ask for talks with the drug traffickers. He
said the country finds itself at war with the traffickers and ``in
a war situation you don't wait for the earth to be scorched to look
for a way out of the problem.''
   Gomez is the owner of the Medellin newspaper El Colombiano. Drug
traffickers have killed his chief of security, shot up his house
and tried to bomb his newspaper.
   Colombians have long pointed out that they do not have the
resources that the United States has for fighting drug trafficking.
   Colombian anti-drug agents often are armed with outdated weapons
and communications equipment and have only a dozen helicopters.
   An air force pilot flying operations against coca plantations in
the eastern jungles once said the air force doesn't have spraying
planes able to carry enough fuel and insecticide to reach the
remote areas.
   A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Colombia said
Colombian agents often had to beg U.S. agents for gas for their
cars to go on raids.
   Drug traffickers, on the other hand, have massive amounts of
funds, fleets of helicopters, jets and other planes, private armies
with the latest in submachine guns and other equipment, bulletproof
cars and hundreds of fast boats.
   Fortune magazine last year reported that two Colombian alleged
drug traffickers are among the richest men in the world. It said
Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Luis Ochoa each have between $2
billion and $3 billion.

   About 10,000 demonstrators gathered
outside the government's nuclear weapons research center Monday on
the 30th anniversary of Britain's first ``Ban the Bomb'' march,
police said.
   Thames Valley Police Chief Inspector Laurie Fray said it was ``a
mostly quiet and peaceful demonstration,'' although police arrested
four people for criminal damage and public order offenses.
   Defense Ministry police said they arrested six more protesters.
   About 1,000 of the demonstrators walked the 52 miles from London
to the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Establishment in
Berkshire County. They set off from London's Hyde Park on Good
Friday.
   Some of the demonstrators attached paper doves to the six-mile
chain-link fence surrounding the establishment. Others watched
street musicians and entertainers peforming outside the base's
gates or had picnics with their families.
   The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Britain's main
anti-nuclear group, and the Aldermaston Women's Campaign, asked the
demonstrators not to try to enter the base.
   Dick Tomms, 75, who was on the first march to the base in 1958,
was among the demonstrators Monday.
   ``The early Aldermaston marches were very important world events
and we hope that it might get back to being on that scale,'' Tomms
said.
   Organizers had planned to circle the base holding hands, but the
crowd size made it too difficult, they said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest levels since
mid-January.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.98 percent, up from 5.69 percent
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.21 percent, up from 6.0 percent last

   The rates were the highest since Jan. 19 when three-month bills
sold for an identical 5.98 percent and six-month bills averaged
6.37 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.16 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,848.80 and 6.5 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,686.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages was 6.78 percent
last week, virtually unchanged from 6.77 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Farmers Carried $6.07 Billion Crop Insurance In 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers carried $6.07 billion worth of
all-risk crop insurance in 1987 on a record 62 million acres of
production, the American Association of Crop Insurers said Monday.
   E. Eugene Gantz, executive vice president of the association,
said farmers paid $274 million in 1987 premiums and received $335
million in loss payments for the year. Nationally, that meant for
each $1 paid in premiums, farmers received $1.22 in indemnities.
   The ``multiple peril crop insurance'' program includes
commercial companies that are reinsured against catastrophic loss
by the Federal Crop Insurance Corp., an agency of the Agriculture
Department. The FCIC also handles insurance directly through master
marketers, who account for about 20 percent of the total.
   Up to 30 percent of a farmer's all-risk insurance premium is
subsidized by the FCIC.
   When the federal subsidies are included, the 1987 premiums
totaled $365 million, compared with the benefits of $335 million.
Thus, the 1987 loss ratio was 0.92, or 92 cents paid out for each
$1 of premium.
   Gantz said that was the lowest ratio since the multiple peril
crop insurance program began in 1981.
   Under the program, farmers can buy varying levels of coverage
for a variety of crops to insure them against loss from floods,
drought, insects and other natural causes.
   ``As we look forward to 1988, we hope for another good loss
ratio performance,'' Gantz said. ``But we're concerned with dry
conditions already cropping up in the West and Midwest.''
   The deadline for farmers to sign up for 1988 crop insurance is
April 15 in most areas of the country (it was March 31 in some of
the early planting areas of the South), he said.
   Farmers who produce spring-planted crops also should keep in
mind that without crop insurance they are not eligible for
Agriculture Department disaster assistance, such as low-interest
loans from the Farmers Home Administration, Gantz said.
   The 1987 coverage on 62 million acres of crops compared with
60.7 million acres in 1986 and 46.5 million acres when the program
began in 1981. A low-point was reached in 1983 when plantings were
cut sharply by drought and government acreage programs. Only 31.3
million acres of crops were insured that year.
   However, the mix of crops and variations in kinds of coverage
have resulted in wide variations of coverage value. Last year's
$6.07 billion in coverage was down from more than $6.22 billion in
1986, for example, despite the record acreage. And in 1985,
coverage totaled nearly $7.17 billion on $59.1 million.

<HEAD>Jackson Wins Support of Blue-Collar Unions in Wisconsin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson appears to have won the hearts
of Wisconsin's packinghouse, auto and paper workers _ people he
calls the victims of ``economic violence'' _ but the state's two
biggest unions remain divided going into Tuesday's primary.
   The three blue-collar groups in the past year have suffered
through announcements of plant shutdowns or ongoing attempts to
replace them with strikebreakers.
   Jackson alone among the Democratic presidential candidates has
stood on all of their protest and picket lines, and well before
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Tennessee Albert Gore Jr.
stepped foot in the state.
   ``Al Gore visited us and Dukakis showed up at the Labor Temple
in Green Bay last Friday,'' said Roger Murphy, one of 370 mostly
white paperworkers on strike the past 10 months against
International Paper Co.'s mill at DePere.
   ``But they're just reading off the script Jesse wrote,'' Murphy
said. ``Anybody who belongs to any kind of union will vote for
Jackson; he represents our personalities the most.''
   The DePere strike, another by 900 United Food and Commercial
Workers at Smithfield Foods' plant at Cudahy, and Chrysler Corp.'s
plans to close it 5,500-employee Kenosha plant have gotten the
candidates' attention.
   And the 6,770 workers at all three have clearly sided with
Jackson. But there are 220,000 other union workers in Wisconsin,
and their preferences are unclear, according to leaders of their
unions.
   ``The problem is the people who are striking or are in trouble
are the ones who vote, and those who are working don't,'' said Joan
Baggett, political director for the Bricklayers union and a Dukakis
supporter. ``That raises a real question about us getting a
November-electable candidate.''
   Joel Vattendahl, head of the United Steel Workers' 13,000
members in Wisconsin, believes Dukakis will get more of their votes
than Jackson, as does Morris Andrews, exeuctive secretary of the
largest union in the state, the 48,000-member Wisconsin Education
Association.
   ``Jackson is turning on the people who don't normally vote,''
said Andrews, a Gore supporeter and a member of the Democratic
National Convention's platform committee four years ago. ``But he's
coming from behind and we're all over the lot.''
   The American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, with more than 46,000 members in Wisconsin, also is
divided.
   AFSCME is running Wisconsin phone banks for both Dukakis and
Jackson. In congressional districts where there are black
population pockets _ Milwaukee, Madison and Racine _ AFSCME locals
have endorsed both Dukakis and Jackson. In the six other mostly
white areas of the state, its endorsement went only to Dukakis.
   The clear loser, labor activists agree, in Tuesday's balloting
will be Illinois Sen. Paul Simon. Based solely on his win in his
home state primary May 15, Simon now has more labor convention
delegates than any other candidate: 20 according to the AFL-CIO's
latest tabulations.
   Jackson is second with 15, followed by Gore with 10 and Dukakis
with six.
   ``Quite sadly, Wisconsin will show Simon to be yesterday's
tomatoes,'' said Vattendahl of the Steel Workers, a union where
Simon has enjoyed the greatest support.
   The Steel Workers were instrumental in persuading Simon to stay
in the race through the Illinois pimary and had hoped he would do
well enough in Wisconsin to stay in the race through the April 26
primary in Pennsylvania, where the union has its greatest political
clout.
   Vattendahl now believes his union's Wisconsin members will vote
Dukakis and Jackson ``in that order'' Tuesday despite what he
called Jackson's ``willingness to get down with the people.''
   Mark Rosenbaum, president of the UFCW Local P-40 that is
striking the Cudahy plant, has made trips to California to raise
campaign money on Jackson's behalf.
   ``The picket line is white, the strikebreakers are black,'' said
Allen Zack, a UFCW spokeman. ``The company orchestrated letters to
Jackson from scabs saying that he was selling them out. And he
replied a scab is a scab. Our Cudahy people are big Jackson fans.''
   Jackson, likewise has been endorsed by Local 72 of the United
Auto Workers that represents the 5,500 workers at Kenosha after
visiting it right after Chrysler announced in January its intention
to close the plant next summer.
   Both Gore and Dukakis in the past week have denounced Chrysler
Chairman Lee Iacocca, but labor leaders view it as too little and
too late.

<HEAD>Soviet Union To Buy 1 Million More Metric Tons Of US Wheat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has been given the go-ahead
to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Acting Undersecretary Thomas O. Kay said that since April 1987,
the subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled more than
11.8 million tons under previously announced allocations of the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   More than 7.6 million tons of the 11.8 million tons of
subsidized wheat bought by the Soviet Union has gone to fill its
commitment under the fifth and final year of a long-term grain
agreement with the United States.
   The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on Moscow to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets
are required to seek U.S. approval. The Soviets have been given
approval to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   If Moscow buys all of the new authorization, that would push
wheat sales in the last year of the agreement to more than 8.6
million tons. All of the wheat has been subsidized.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 4.1 million tons of
non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of U.S. soybeans and 1.3 million
tons of soybean meal.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $20 to
more than $40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Officials also said 490,000 tons of wheat (about 18 million
bushels) were sold to the Soviet Union under the previous EEP
authorization announced on March 18. The sales were handled by 10
companies, whose subsidies will average $19.79 per ton, or 54 cents
per bushel.
   The companies and the quantities included: Continental Grain
Co., 125,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 65,000; Mitsubishi International
Corp., 25,000; Artfer Inc., 50,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000;
Coprostates Inc., 25,000; Bunge Corp., 25,000; Marubeni America
Corp., 25,000; Tradigrain Inc., 50,000; and Union Equity
Cooperative Exchange, 50,000.
   No prices were announced, but wheat has been selling recently
for around $2.74 per bushel, meaning the U.S. farm value could be
about $49 million.

   The number of refugees increased by 1.5
million to more than 13 million worldwide last year, but their
chances for finding refuge in the United States and other countries
diminished, a refugee relief group says.
   The ``World Refugee Survey'' from the U.S. Committee for
Refugees said the number of refugees worldwide increased from 11.7
million in 1986 to 13.3 million last year, but many of those
seeking asylum here were discouraged by harsh Immigration and
Naturalization policies, particularly in regard to refugees from El
Salvador, Haiti and Indochina.
   ``Rather than granting the asylum seeker ... to present his case
freely and fairly, we seem to do everything in our power to
prejudge him as a cheat and treat him like a criminal,'' Bill
Frelick, assistant editor of the report, said.
   ``The problem may not be a question of law. But it is a question
of justice.''
   Frelick quoted a report by the congressional General Accounting
Office saying that in New York the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service detained criminal aliens from El Salvador
and Haiti, along with others.
   Some guards under contract are charged with ``lack of vigilance,
gross negligence to duty, and suspected collusion in detainee
escapes.''
   He also quotes a sworn statement from an Afghan he says was
excluded after six months of detention:
   ``From this jail and the mental torture I have been put through,
it has become clear to me that what I heard about the United
States... is nothing other than a dream and propaganda. The United
States will never extend a helping hand to me.''
   The signer of the statement is not named.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis did not immediately respond to
requests for comment on the report.
   A State Department official said the United States screens
fleeing Haitians to determine who are political refugees. The
United States has an agreement with Haiti that provides
international access to those sent home to see they are well
treated.
   Court Robinson, the committee's specialist on southeast Asia,
predicted in an interview Monday that the number of Indochinese
brought into this country from camps in Thailand will fall short of
the permitted 29,500 in the year ending Sept. 30.
   But the State Department official responded that the ceiling
usually is reached and that another 8,500 can come directly from
Vietnam, if the Vietnamese government permits.
   Robinson said the Thai government had virtually stopped taking
any more refugees at the end of January. Thailand already had more
than 404,000, nearly all from the communist-ruled countries of
Indochina, according to the survey.
   The survey also reported diminishing opportunities for refugees
reaching other countries with more resources to take care of them.
Canada's government, angered by boatloads of undocumented Asians,
is pushing through Parliament a law that will make it a crime to
bring them in without proper papers and will permit aliens to be
detained.
   West Germany cut applications for asylum almost in half by
turning away those who had spent more than three months in another
country considered safe, Frelick says.
   New restrictions are also reported from Britain and Switzerland.
   The number of refugees seeking homes in the United States and
other western industrial countries is small compared with the
biggest new wave: 350,000 who fled to Malawi last year from the
rebellion against the government of Mozambique in southeastern
Africa.
   ``At the end of 1987, more than 2 million of these affected
persons are are physically displaced within Mozambique, and more
than 800,000 others have sought refuge from the conflict in the
neighboring countries of Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland and
South Africa,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., wrote in an
article in the survey.
   Though there was no one big movement last year, the numbeer of
Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, and of Ethiopian refugees in
Somalia and Sudan are much greater. The survey quotes Louis and
Nancy Hatch Dupree of Duke University as putting the total number
of Afghans in Pakistan at 3.2 million with 6,000 to 8,000 arriving
every month. The survey puts another 2.2 million in Iran.
   It estimates that there are 677,000 Ethiopians in Sudan and
another 430,000 in Somalia, though the last number is disputed.
   The U.S. Committee for Refugees is supported by the Ford
Foundation, religious groups and charities.

   The popular myth may be of a caveman
dragging off his women by her hair, but women were probably behind
many of the major inventions of prehistoric times, a researcher
said Monday.
   ``Women may be responsible for the major technological
innovations in prehistory _ the invention of pottery, horticulture
and agriculture, basketmaking, weaving and textiles,'' said Joan
Gero.
   Ms. Gero, an assistant professor of anthropology at the
University of South Carolina, is one of the organizers of an
international conference to discuss women's roles in prehistory.
   The five-day conference, which opens Tuesday at The Wedge
Plantation near Georgetown, ``is the first archaeological
conference designed to separate out gender roles in prehistory,''
she said.
   Seventeen researchers, including archaeologists,
anthropologists, historians and a philosopher, will gather for the
meeting.
   Included in the group are three noted researchers _ Irene
Silverblatt of the Smithsonian Institution, Peter White of the
University of Sydney and Henrietta Moore, an anthropologist from
Cambridge University.
   Much of what will be discussed flies in the face of the
conventional wisdom. For instance, it's generally a given in
archaeological circles that man was the toolmaker in prehistoric
times, Ms. Gero said.
   But some researchers are suggesting that, based on clues from
the past and observations of present-day preindustrial societies,
that women were responsible for making tools and pottery.
   ``The irony is that huge chunks of the archaeological record may
in fact be the result of women's labor,'' Ms. Gero said. ``Eighty
percent of the archaeologists in the world use pottery to sort out
time periods.''
   Separating the female roles from the male roles in prehistoric
societies ``is a real challenge. It's so hard to do that's why it's
gone so long undone,'' Ms. Gero said.
   She noted that while unearthing a pharaoh's tomb gives
scientists clues as to how a small group of people lived ``we're
looking for half the human race.''
   ``One thing we hope will come out of this is an inspection of
what it means to be female and what it means to be male,'' she
said. ``We have a notion of females _ women don't make tools. But
women were responsible for making a lot of stone tools.''
   Often, she said, people consider the past in terms of their
present day thinking on what is male and female.
   ``You don't want to say women did exactly what they're doing
now,'' she said. ``If we can envision the roles that women played
in the past, that itself is a means to get at what male and female
mean in different societies.''

   Manufacturing corporations' after-tax profits
averaged 4.3 cents per dollar of sales in the October-December
quarter, down almost one-fourth from the third quarter of 1987, the
government reported Monday.
   The Commerce Department said American manufacturers' after-tax
profits totaled a seasonally adjusted $26.4 billion in the fourth
quarter, compared with $33.6 billion in the third quarter, when
profits averaged 5.6 cents per dollar.
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $609.8 billion in the fourth

   Both makers of durable goods _ items expected to last three
years _ and non-durable goods saw after-tax earnings decline in the
fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
   More of the Farmers Home Administration's
rural development loans may be targeted to areas of high
unemployment, the Agriculture Department agency said Monday.
   FmHA administrator Vance L. Clark said a proposed change in the
rules would direct a higher proportion of the agency's business and
industrial loan guarantees to smaller companies where there is high
unemployment.
   The ``B&I'' program involves guarantees by FmHA on loans made by
commercial lenders to provide jobs through new or expanded
businesses in rural areas.
   ``As a general policy, we want to gear the limited B&I loan
funds to smaller businesses in areas where they can provide jobs
for rural people, especially displaced farmers,'' Clark said.
   Under the proposal, loan guarantees would range from 70 percent
to 90 percent of the loan value, with the higher guarantee reserved
for smaller loans.
   A spokesman, Joe O'Neill, said B&I loan guarantees range up to
$10 million per project. Those of up to $2 million would carry the
90 percent guarantee; $2 million to $5 million, 80 percent; and $5
million to $10 million, 70 percent, he said.

   Dyer's woad, a weed that wages chemical war
against neighboring plants, is infesting parts of the West, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Range scientist James A. Young of the department's Agricultural
Research Service facility in Reno, Nev., said dyer's woad was used
in Europe for thousands of years to make purple dye. Its seeds may
have come into the United States in alfalfa seed from Ireland in
the 1920s.
   In any case, he said in a report issued in Washington, the
3-foot-tall weed has taken hold in California, Oregon, Utah,
Wyoming and Idaho, and it's difficult to eradicate.
   Young became interested in dyer's woad when he noticed it
spreading into northern California fields already infested with
other weeds. Laboratory and field studies showed dyer's woad seed
pods secreted a toxin that killed the roots of nearby grasslike
weeds, including those grazed by cattle.
   The process is called allelopathy _ when one plant species
secretes a chemical that inhibits the growth of another species.
The only way neighboring plants can be saved from dyer's woad is by
spring rains that soak into the ground and flush away the chemical,
he said.
   If the chemical could be synthesized, it might be turned into an
evironmentally safe herbicide, ``but that's all down the road,''
Young said.

<HEAD>Strike Ends In Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of shops and stores reopened
to little business in Panama City on Monday, ending a two-week
strike that failed to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's grip on
this tense nation.
   As the capital began regaining a semblance of normalcy, the
United States prepared to send an additional 1,300 military
personnel to Panama. The Reagan administration said the troops,
scheduled to start arriving Tuesday, would help safeguard the lives
and property of American citizens.
   The U.S. State Department said U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis
suffered ``deliberate harassment'' when his limousine was chased
for two miles Sunday by a Panamanian military patrol car.
   The Panamanian government denied the charge, but did admit that
the ambassador's car had been tailed in ``strictly a police
matter.''
   Justice Minister Rodolfo Chiari de Leon said the incident
occurred when a patrol spotted ``an exaggerated display of
automatic arms carried by civilian elements traveling in three
vehicles'' that followed the ambassador.
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the ambassador, acknowledged
that U.S. security guards were following Davis in at least one
other vehicle. She called it a routine precaution but declined to
give details.
   In Washington, Phyllis Oakley, the State Department's deputy
spokeswoman, used the incident to step up administration criticism
of Noriega, commander of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and
the power behind the civilian government.
   ``We consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to be
serious as always,'' she said. ``We will take the necessary steps
to protect Americans. I am condemning the incident from the podium.
We regard the action as deliberate harassment.''
   Meanwhile, Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
released a letter from Noriega in which the general rejected ``any
political and economic program ... dictated from Washington, D.C.''
   Jackson, who had sent a letter to Noriega on March 22 urging him
to step down, said he would forward Noriega's response to Congress
and to the State Department.
   Jackson, campaigning for votes in Wisconsin, said he remained
``convinced that it is in the best interests of the Panamanian
people for Gen. Noriega to leave. Today I reiterate my public moral
appeal for him to depart.''
   The State Department reacted with displeasure to the candidate's
exchange with the Panamanian strongman.
   ``In our view, proliferation of channels is a tactic that
Noriega likes to use to buy time,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``We have
available channels of communication with Noriega if and when they
are needed.''
   Noriega has rejected an offer of asylum in a third country in
exchange for a State Department promise not to seek his extradition
for trial on federal indictments issued in February in Florida
charging him with drug trafficking.
   Businesses began reopening in Panama City's central commercial
district, ending a strike by anti-government groups. However, many
merchants were pessimistic about the economy, which has been
crippled by cash shortages, anti-government unrest and U.S.
sanctions.
   Manuel Lopez, who opened his furniture store for the first time
since March 19, said his last sale was five weeks ago and he has
paying his employees partial wages.
   ``We give them food, too,'' Lopez said. ``It has come to that.''
   The owner of an electronics shop said he reopened because
competitors did, but asked: ``Who is going to buy this kind of
thing right now?''
   ``This is a disaster,'' said the shopkeeper, who asked not to be
identified for fear of reprisals. ``We don't know what's going to
happen. But when (Noriega) goes, things will improve right away.''
   Panama's banks have been closed since March 3, creating a
critical cash shortage. The United States has frozen Panamanian
funds held in U.S. banks and imposed other sanctions, including the
withholding of about $6.5 million a month in user fees for the
Panama Canal.
   Panamanians began a run on banks in late February, when Noriega
orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who had
called for the strongman's resignation.
   The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command, which already has 10,500
military personnel in the country, said a few planeloads of
additional troops and equipment were expected Tuesday afternoon,
with most of the remainder arriving Wednesday.
   The Pentagon said last week that it decided on the buildup
because of the ``instability of the current situation in Panama,
the heavy-handed tactics of Noriega in dealing with the situation
and the potential for increased threats to U.S. citizens and
interests.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Challenges Posner's $3 Million Homeless Gift Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sentence that requires industrialist Victor
Posner to make a $3 million contribution to the homeless is illegal
and shows ``the rich can trade money for liberty while the poor
cannot,'' prosecutors said Monday in a challenge to the penalty.
   Posner pleaded no contest to 10 federal tax fraud counts for
inflating the value of land he donated to a religious school, but
avoided prison when he was sentenced Feb. 12 to pay $4 million in
court costs and penalties, plus $3 million to South Florida
homeless programs.
   ``Laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be, we
submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of
justice, and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for
liberty while the poor cannot,'' said U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner in
a motion filed Monday.
   A hearing on Posner's plan for distribution of the $3 million is
scheduled for Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Eugene P.
Spellman.
   Among the conditions imposed by Spellman was that Posner could
not take a tax deduction for the donation and that he could not
file for voluntary bankrutptcy.
   Spellman said he would have no comment on the motion and was
awaiting a response by Posner's attorneys.
   A federal court ``cannot order a convicted defendant to make a
charitable contribution of money to a non-aggrieved person as a
condition of probation,'' said Kellner.
   The court can only ask, not demand, that Posner make the
donation, and cannot incarcerate him if he fails to do so, Kellner
said.
   ``Sadly, we are compelled to observe that this sentence is
illegal,'' the prosecutor said.
   The motion says Spellman stated that if any of the special
conditions were violated, it would result in Posner having to serve
a prison sentence, although the court ``did not indicate what its
sentence would otherwise have been.''
   The government does not believe that Posner's acceptance of the
terms changes the illegality of the sentence, prosecutors said.
   ``The law does not allow an exchange of money for jail time,
even for the benefit of a badly needed societal purpose,'' said the
motion.

   Iran hit Iraqi oil centers with a missile
and air raids Monday in response to attacks on its major
refineries, and Iraq fired a rocket into Isfahan.
   Iran said its artillerymen shelled defensive positions in the
Kurdistan mountains of northeast Iraq, where Revolutionary Guards
have captured a large area around strategic Lake Darbandikhan in a
3-week-old offensive.
   It said Revolutionary Guards and Kurdish guerrillas repulsed
counterattacks by two Iraqi brigades in the battle zone, killing or
wounding 150 men.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. secretary-general, is to meet
Iranian and Iraqi envoys in New York this week in search of a
cease-fire in the war, which began in September 1980. The Security
Council passed a resolution July 20 demanding a truce.
   The Iraqis threatened on Monday to level Iran's cities in
revenge for the northern offensive. Iranian invaders are 75 miles
from the Kirkuk oil fields, which account for more than half the
crude oil production with which President Saddam Hussein's
government finances the war.
   A dispatch from Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Revolutionary Guards shot a long-range missile at Kirkuk's oil
refinery Monday in retaliation for Iraqi air raids the previous day
on oil refineries in Tabriz and Isfahan.
   IRNA said 22 civilians were killed and 77 wounded Sunday in
Tabriz but gave no report of casualties in Isfahan, the 17th
century capital of Persia.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency said the missile fired
Monday exploded in a residential neighborhood of Kirkuk, killing or
wounding ``many civilians.''
   Other reports from the agency said Iraq's air force flew 206
sorties against Iranian troop concentrations and bombed oil
installations in Mahshar on the Persian Gulf coast.
   The Iranians reported casualties in Mahshar, but did not give
figures. They said Iraq jets bombed Dezful in western Iran and
Abadan, a southwestern oil center.
   Isfahan has been the target of 12 missiles, including the one on
Monday, since Iran and Iraq began firing long-range missiles in to
each other's cities Feb. 29. Iraq had suspended attacks on Iranian
cities for three days during a visit to Baghdad by Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal of Turkey that ended Sunday.
   A total of more than 250 missiles have been launched by both
sides. Iran has reported more than 1,150 civilians killed and 4,000
wounded. Iraq has not given figures but said there were hundreds of
casualties.
   Reports from IRNA said Iranian fighter-bombers attacked a
petrochemical complex in the battered southern port city of Basra
twice on Monday.
   Iraq's news agency quoted a military spokesman in Baghdad as
saying: ``Because Iran insists on committing more crimes, we shall
pound Iranian cities with missiles and other means until they are
destroyed.''
   Perez de Cuellar is to meet with Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Mohammed Javad Larijani, and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq.
   Akram al-Witri, chief of the legal department at Iraq's Foreign
Ministry, accused Perez de Cuellar on Sunday of having ``vested
interests'' in favoring Iran. He was not specific.
   Last week, Aziz expressed ``bitterness and disappointment at the
biased and ill-balanced nature'' of recent statements by the U.N.
secretary-general on the alleged use of chemical weapons by Iraq.
   Iran claims the Iraqis dropped chemical bombs March 16-17 on
Kurdish towns captured in the northern offensive, killing 5,000
civilians and wounding an equal number.
   Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas say hundreds more have been
killed in poison gas attacks on mountain villages.
   Iraq has not denied using chemical weapons, which are outlawed
under a 1925 Geneva agreement, and said March 26 it was ``firmly
determined to use all available capabilities to destroy the
invaders.''

<HEAD>Romanian Negotiators Seek Trade Concessions Despite Rights
Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Romania is asking for concessions to offset
the effects of its unilateral renunciation of special trade
privileges with the United States, U.S. sources close to the talks
said Monday.
   The State Department announced that talks were held last week in
Washington with a Romanian trade delegation to assess the effects
of Romania's decision to renounce its Most Favored Nation trade
status.
   The decision, announced in February, means that on July 3 all
Romanian exports to the United States will be taxed as much as 40
percent, compared with 3 or 4 percent previously.
   Romania, which has implemented severe austerity measures,
estimates the lost privileges will cost it $250 million in export
revenues from the United States, which amounted to $775 million in
1987. The Romanians sell the United States wooden furniture, small
engines, leather, textiles and aluminum products.
   The Romanian decision appears to have been motivated by its
reluctance to ease human rights restrictions in return for the
favored trading status, which most other communist countries do not
enjoy. The United States has accused Romania of suppressing free
speech, religious practice and political organizing.
   The U.S. delegation at last week's trade talks ``stressed that
issues of human rights would continue to be a central part of the
U.S.-Romanian dialogue, and that positive movement on such matters
would be an important factor permitting progress in other areas of
our bilateral relations,'' the State Department said.
   The statement also said both sides agreed to hold future
high-level consultations on trade and human rights issues. U.S.
officials refused to further discuss the talks.
   However, two U.S. sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Romania had asked for special concessions. The sources did not
elaborate on what Romania had specifically sought during the two
days of talks.
   Romanian Deputy Foreign Minister Olimpia Solomonescu, who led
her country's negotiating team, indicated she had not won any
concrete concessions from the U.S. side, one source said.
   ``But she said she felt it was a good start'' for future talks,
he added.
   While Romania is no longer eligible for U.S. trade concessions,
it has other bargaining chips such as its non-aligned foreign
policy.
   For instance, Romania is the only communist country to have full
diplomatic ties with Israel. ``In the past they've been able to use
this independence from Moscow to win favors here,'' said a source.
   But this may be less effective with the openness of the Soviet
bloc's foreign policy under the glasnost regime of Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, he added.

   Four British boys in the Alps for a
school outing left their group while climbing in the snow Monday,
lost their footing and slipped over a precipice, falling hundreds
of feet to their deaths, officials reported.
   Norbert Huber of the air rescue office in Salzburg said six
youngsters set off at lunchtime without skis to climb a mountain
near Untersberg, a village on the border with West Germany.
   Salzburg police said the four boys who were killed apparently
started sliding around in the snow, lost control and went over the
precipice. Police spokesman Alois Wintersteller said it appeared
they were playing.
   Wintersteller said the victims were Andrew Powell-Lee, 15;
Andrew Watts, 14; Michael Taylor, 13, and Daniel Howton, 14, all
pupils of the Altwood Church of England School in Maidenhead, in
Berkshire west of London.
   They were on a school expedition for the Easter holidays, with a
group staying at a youth hostel in Salzburg, he said.
   The four boys apparently ignored a warning from adults and
strayed from a set route, Huber and police said. They said the
party was 4,950 feet above sea level on a 6,504-foot peak.
   ``Nobody was really there to see exactly what happened, so we
don't know,'' said one police spokesman, who asked that his name
not be used. He estimated the snow at more than 6 feet deep where
the teen-agers fell and said the weather was fairly clear.
   The boys' bodies were found after their two companions went down
the mountain and met a teacher. The teacher waited with them for
the missing students and then took a ski lift up the slope to
search.
   Huber said the teacher later notified rescuers and the bodies
were recovered by helicopter. He said the boys fell between 150 and
650 feet.
   Wintersteller said the accident occurred about 2:15 p.m. but
rescue services were not notified until 4:40 p.m. because the
teacher and two boys, unaware of the tragedy, were waiting for the
youngsters to return.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call for Broad Political Amnesty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo should
follow through on his promise to institute a broad political
amnesty, 100 members of Congress said in a letter to him Monday.
   ``We are most concerned by reports that as many as 1,000 persons
remain in prison for political related offenses,'' said the letter.
   ``While we welcome the Feb. 26 amnesty and the reported release
of 125 political prisoners, we believe that many persons who have
neither advocated nor engaged in violence remain in custody,'' the
legislators said.
   Among the signers were Sens. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Paul
Simon, D-Ill., who are both seeking the Democratic presidential
nomination, and Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   The list of political prisoners released the day after Roh was
inaugurated Feb. 25 included only two of the 26 people who had been
declared ``prisoners of conscience'' by the private group Amnesty
International, the legislators said.

<HEAD>CBS News: `Disappointed' By Scotus Ruling In Favor of Cigarette
Maker</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with two grafs, picking up third pvs, and INSERTS 3
grafs after 10th pvs, ``The cigarette maker xxx, with libel expert
saying judgment is a record</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS said Monday it was ``disappointed'' that the
U.S. Supreme Court let stand a record $3 million judgment in a
libel lawsuit brought by a cigarette manufacturer.
   The libel award was the largest ever upheld on appeal, said
Henry Kaufman of the Libel Defense Resource Center in New York City.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the judgment
for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. violated the rights of the
network and Walter Jacobson, anchor for WBBM-TV, a Chicago station
owned and operated by CBS.
   ``We're disappointed,'' Doug Jacobs, associate general counsel
for CBS Inc., said on behalf of the network and WBBM. ``We believed
these issues were important enough for review.''
   ``There's no way that I, with malice or forethought, told a lie
on television. It's never happened and it never will,'' Jacobson
said Monday, adding that the case ``hasn't inhibited me. As long as
I can tell the truth and be fair, I'm not affected.''
   ``We're pleased that the good name of the company and its people
have been vindicated,'' said Michael Bateman, a spokesman for the
Louisville, Ky.-based cigarette maker.
   Brown & Williamson, maker of Viceroy cigarettes, accused CBS and
Jacobson of libeling it in a Nov. 11, 1981, broadcast.
   Jacobson, in a nightly feature called ``Walter Jacobson's
Perspective,'' said there was a Viceroy advertising strategy to
attract young people to smoking by linking cigarettes ``to pot,
wine, beer and sex.''
   He said the idea was to present cigarette smoking as ``an
initiation into the adult world ... as an illicit pleasure.''
   The cigarette maker denied the allegation; it said a
pre-broadcast denial to WBBM-TV was not incorporated into
Jacobson's commentary.
   Kaufman, the libel expert, said the award was nearly four times
larger than the previous standard _ an $850,000 judgment against
the Outlet Co., which he said operated a television station in
Texas.
   He said most multimillion-dollar jury awards against news media
defendants are thrown out or reduced on appeal, with those upheld
averaging between $100,000 and $150,000.
   ``This is the first libel award that has broken through the
psychological $1 million barrier on appeal, the first that has been
able to make it through the process intact,'' Kaufman said.
   A federal trial in the case ended in November 1985 with a jury
award of $5 million to Brown & Williamson.
   In August, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago
rejected CBS' arguments that the broadcast was intended as opinion
and thus could not be libelous, upholding $3 million of the award
against CBS and $50,000 against Jacobson.
   The appeals court found the remarks about Viceroy were presented
as factual, even if the tone of the broadcast suggested an
editorial.
   The 7th Circuit also rejected CBS' claim that the broadcast was
truthful.
   In his statements about the marketing strategy, Jacobson cited
what he said was a confidential report prepared by the Federal
Trade Commission. But the court said the FTC report did not make
such allegations and the jury was entitled to find that Jacobson's
broadcast was not a fair summary.
   Finally, the appeals court ruled that Jacobson and CBS acted
with ``actual malice'' in broacasting the commentary.
   For a public figure to win a libel suit, it must be shown there
was actual malice _ that statements were made with knowledge they
were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. The tobacco
company was considered a public figure for purposes of the suit.
   The 7th Circuit court said that after the libel suit was filed,
a researcher for Jacobson destroyed documents that might have
supported the cigarette company's case.
   ``A court and a jury are entitled to presume that documents
destroyed in bad faith while litigation is pending would be
unfavorable to the party that has destroyed the documents,'' the
appeals court said.
   Jacobs, the CBS attorney, contended the original federal court
juy ``put too much stock into the destruction of documents issue.''
   CBS already has paid Brown & Williamson $3.4 million to cover
the libel award and interest.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III faces an
ethics investigation by the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility, department sources said Monday, a
process that ultimately could result in a recommendation to
President Reagan that Meese be fired.
   Investigators in OPR, which monitors potentially illegal and
unethical behavior inside the department, began examining Meese's
ties to longtime friend E. Robert Wallach last year and whether
they constitute unethical conduct, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   That review was halted when independent counsel James McKay
launched his criminal investigation of Meese last May 11, the
sources said.
   However, the head of OPR, Michael Shaheen, denied through a
Justice Department spokesman, Terry Eastland, that his office had
conducted such an examination of Meese-Wallach ties last year.
   The files of former Assistant Attorney General William Weld on
Meese's dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last Friday, said
the sources, confirming a report in Saturday editions of The
Washington Post. Material collected by Weld's criminal division
last year led to McKay's criminal investigation of Meese.
   Upon completion of McKay's probe, OPR is prepared to delve into
whether Meese's actions at Wallach's behest on behalf of
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
may have violated a 1965 presidential order on ethic standards for
executive-branch employees, the sources said.
   McKay said Friday that if he decides not to seek a criminal
indictment of Meese, the independent counsel's office ``will refer
all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate
administrative authorities,'' a reference to OPR.
   OPR has the power to recommend a range of options, including
docking of pay, suspension or dismissal.
   The executive order on ethics prohibits ``using public office
for private gain; giving preferential treatment to any organization
or person; ... losing complete independence or impartiality of
action'' and ``making a government decision outside official
channels.''
   ``From our standpoint based on what we know there has been no
violation by Mr. Meese of any ethical regulation or guidelines in
any of the affairs that the independent counsel has been looking
into,'' said one of Meese's lawyers, James Rocap.
   ``For there to be speculation before the matters have been
referred to these agencies is in my view irresponsible, specious,
unfair and unwarranted.''
   Reagan has made it clear that he is strongly supportive of
Meese, despite the nearly 11-month probe of the attorney general
and the resignations last week of Weld and Deputy Attorney General
Arnold Burns, who reportedly were concerned that the investigation
is hurting the department's operations and its image.
   But any adverse recommendation from OPR's chief, Shaheen, would
be another political embarrassment to the Reagan administration and
produce renewed cries for Meese's resignation.
   Justice Department sources supplied the following instances by
Meese suggesting possible use of public office for private gain,
preferential treatment of Wallach, loss of independence or
operating outside channels in potential violation of the ethics
order:
   _In 1981 and 1982, Wallach sent to Meese's home about a dozen
memos touting Wedtech Corp., which was trying to obtain a $32
million, no-bid defense contract to build small engines for the
Army. Meese interceded on the company's behalf, an act that
culminated with the contract going to Wedtech. Wallach, now under a
racketeering indictment, in the Wedtech scandal, collected $1.3
million from the company from 1981 to 1986. At the time he received
the memos, Meese was White House counselor.
   _In May 1985, Wallach, then representing Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, sought Meese's assistance in boosting the Iraqi oil
pipeline. Meese referred the matter to then-national security
adviser Robert McFarlane, which culminated in a meeting of Wallach,
Rappaport and McFarlane. Meese later advised then-Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres to meet with McFarlane rather than Secretary
of State George Shultz on the pipeline.
   _A $150,000 payment from Rappaport to Wallach wound up being
used for pooled stock trades by Meese's financial manager, W.
Franklyn Chinn. The stock trading got Meese a $40,000 profit on an
investment of just $50,000 in 18 months before the Meese-Chinn
partnership came under fire in Congress last summer and was
dissolved. Wallach had introduced Meese to Chinn, who sat on
Wedtech's board of directors in 1985 and 1986.
   Sources said Shaheen is among a number of Justice Department
personnel who in recent months have been contemplating resigning to
protest Meese's refusal to step down in the face of the ongoing
criminal investigation.
   Shaheen, however, has decided to stay on for now and is
preparing to look into McKay's referral to his office, said the
sources.
   But through Eastland, Shaheen on Monday denied that he had been
contemplating leaving at any point.
   While McKay may decide not to seek an indictment of Meese, he
will compile a report that is expected to provide a mountain of
detail about Meese's involvement with Wallach, according to one
source familiar with the case.
   Such a report would provide a foundation for Shaheen in
evaluating ethical questions, said the Justice Department sources.
   Under Shaheen, OPR found several years ago that Meese's
predecessor, William French Smith, had breached a
conflict-of-interest standard by investing in an oil and natural
gas exploration tax shelter that used a tax benefit calculation
method disapproved by the Internal Revenue Service.
   As a result of another probe by Shaheen's office, Smith in 1984
repaid the government for use of an official car by his wife.
   In a 1980 inquiry, Shaheen concluded that Billy Carter, brother
of then-President Carter, lied to government agents who were
investigating whether he was required to register with the Justice
Department as an agent of the Libyan government.
   Shaheen also said then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti
``dissembled'' at a July 24, 1980 news conference at which he
denied any White House contacts on the Billy Carter case. The
following day, Civiletti acknowledged the conversation with the
president.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Dismantles Military Unit Formed To Act In Tunisia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Monday he
was dismantling a military unit that was created to act inside
Tunisia if the United States used that country to attack Libya, the
Libyan news agency reported.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said Gadhafi also told the visiting
Tunisian prime minister and Cabinet that he ordered a division of
troops withdrawn from the border with Tunisia.
   The troops were sent to the border prior to the new Tunisian
government's taking power last Nov. 7, because Gadhafi believed the
United States intended to use Tunisia to attack Libya, the agency
said.
   Prime Minister Hedi Baccouche of Tunisia and his country's
Council of Ministers came to Libya for talks with Libya's Cabinet.
   Gadhafi said he also will insist on ``opening the artificial
borders with Egypt'' and withdrawing military forces from that
frontier as part of his quest for a unified Arab nation.
   JANA quoted Gadhafi as telling the meeting, ``To bolster
confidence, fraternity, security and safety among the brothers in
Libya and Tunisia, I announce the dismantling of the `Badr'
formation, which was to act inside Tunisian Arab territories if
America used ... (Tunisia) against Libya.''
   He was quoted as saying the formation's weapons were being
presented ``as a gift to the Tunisian Arab armed forces.''
   He hailed the Tunisians who came to power Nov. 7 as being
``among those who prevented America from using Tunisian Arab
territories against Libya,'' the agency said.
   He was referring to the removal of 84-year-old President Habib
Bourguiba, who made Tunisia one of the most Westernized nations in
the Arab world.
   Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, an army general and then the prime
minister, said in November that Bourguiba was incapacitated by age
and health and cited a constitutional provision in taking power.
Ben Ali now is Tunisian president.
   Gadhafi also said he was abolishing the border gate with
Tunisia. Starting Monday, ``Arabs in both Libya and Tunisia can
enter and go out without this gate standing in their way,'' JANA
quoted Gadhafi as saying.
   He expressed regret that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ``had
rejected the opening of the borders'' and said he would send a
letter to Egyptian parties and organizations demanding the border
be opened, the agency reported.
   ``Whoever refuses to open the borders means that he has not will
at hand, or reflects his fear for the Zionists and the Americans
who fill Egypt's streets,'' JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying.
   ``If the present Egyptian rulers are unable to achieve these
unionist proposals, others will achieve them. Victory will be for
these proposals. As for those who oppose them, they will end in the
dustbin of history.''

   Four protesters accused of attacking the
battleship Iowa with hammers, boltcutters and vials of what
appeared to be blood will remain in jail rather than post bond, a
supporter said Monday.
   Longtime activist and former Catholic priest Philip Berrigan,
64, Gregory Boertje, 32, Andrew Lawrence, 28, and Sister Margaret
McKenna, 57, a member of the Medical Mission Sisters, all face
misdemeanor trespassing charges.
   ``They believe that in a corrupt world, their place is in jail.
They are not evading their respnsibility for their actions,'' said
Max Obuszewski. He said the four would not seek to leave jail under
bond.
   The four allegedly boarded the battleship with a tour group
Sunday, then slipped away and attacked two launching boxes holding
Tomahawk missiles.
   Magistrate Tommy Miller explained because the charge was petty
trespassing, the defendants had the choice of trial before a
magistrate or a district judge, but not before a jury.
   Miller set bond at $2,500 and continued the hearing until April
15, when a trial date will be set. No pleas were entered during the
appearance. If convicted each faces a maximum six months in jail
and fine of $500.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Martin would not comment on the
charges nor say why trespassing charges were filed rather than the
destruction of government property charges first indicated by
federal officials.
   The felony destruction charges would have given the defendants
the right to a jury trial.
   The four are members of Nuclear Navy Plowshares, an offshoot of
the Plowshares-Disarmament Actions, which has staged numerous
protests on nuclear weapons.
   The group takes its name from Isaiah 2:4, ``and they shall beat
their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war anymore.''
   In a joint statement distributed prior to the hearing by
Obuszewski, a national representative of the Plowshares group, the
four said:
   ``The USS Iowa is not a component, but a symbol of this
superstate madness... So we come to Norfolk bearing blood and
hammers _ symbols of another kind. They are symbols of repentance
and recreation, most appropriate to this season of resurrection and
rebirth.''
   Berrigan, Boertje and Lawrence are from Baltimore, and Sister
McKenna is from Fox Chase, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb.
   Berrigan, a former Josephite priest, first came to prominence as
a member of a group of draft protesters who threw blood on draft
cards May 17, 1968, at a selective service office in Catonsville,
Md., to protest the Vietnam War.
   In 1980, Berrigan, his brother, Daniel, and six associates
entered the General Electric plant in King of Prussia, Pa., and
hammered at Mark 12-A nuclear warheads.
   Boertje has been wanted by the FBI since he failed to show at
his Nov. 17, 1987, sentencing for allegedly damaging military
aircraft at Willow Grove Naval Air Station outside Philadelphia.
   According to the criminal complaint filed Monday by the FBI,
Berrigan and Sister McKenna appeared alongside the Iowa at the
Norfolk Naval Base on Saturday and questioned a sailor about the
ship's armament. Federal investigators said four protesters then
boarded the ship as part of an open house and attacked the two
launchers.
   Capt. Archie Galloway, a Navy spokesman, said the Navy normally
has two ships open to the public over the weekend. He said the four
protesters where apprehended by the ship's crew following their
demonstration.
   The Tomahawk missile, which can carry either a conventional or
nuclear warhead, is launched from surface ships, submarines and
aircraft.

   Showers were scattered along the East Coast on Monday and over
the Northwest, where snow fell at higher elevations.
   The showers in the East were scattered ahead of a cold front
that extended from the eastern Great Lakes into the southern
Appalachians. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across
central and southern Georgia.
   The showers over the Northwest were widely scattered. Mullan,
Idaho, received 1.5 inches of rain in 24 hours before the
precipitation changed to snowshowers Monday morning.
   Snow advisories were posted for the Cascades of Washington and
Oregon. Mount Baker and Mount Rainier both received 12 to 14 inches
of snow overnight, which totals up to 50 inches of new snow during
the past two days.
   Bald Mountain at Sun Valley, Idaho, got 4 inches of snow with 5
to 10 inches reported at higher elevations.
   Dense fog persisted into the early afternoon from northeastern
Minnesota into parts of Upper Michigan, cutting visibility to a
mile or less.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at McCall, Idaho, to 89 at McAllen, San Angelo and
Junction, Texas. The low for the day was 16 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Tuesday, showers and scattered thunderstorms were forecast
from the Great Lakes region into parts of the middle Mississippi
Valley. Widespread rain was forecast along the northern Pacific
Coast and across northern Maine.
   Highs in the upper 40s and 50s were predicted across northern
New England; in the 50s from the Pacific Northwest through the
northern third of the Rockies, the northern Plains and northwestern
Great Lakes; in the 60s from the northern California coast across
the Great Basin to the central Missouri Valley, central Wisconisn,
Lower Michigan and the eastern Great Lakes to the New Jersey coast;
in the low 90s across southwestern Arizona and from southwestern
into central Texas; and in the 70s or 80s across much of the rest
of the nation.

<HEAD>Question Report that Waldheim Saved Life of British Pilot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Jewish Congress said Monday it found
``highly unlikely'' a report that President Kurt Waldheim of
Austria saved Allied prisoners from execution while he was a German
army officer.
   Bruce Ogilvie, a 66-year-old former fighter pilot, was quoted by
The Sunday Times as saying Waldheim saved him and other prisoners
from being passed to the Nazi SS when he met them on Nov. 19, 1943,
at an airfield outside Athens.
   The British office of the World Jewish Congress said Waldheim
returned to the headquarters of German Army Group E in Arsakli near
Salonika on Oct. 4, 1943, after completing his duties in Athens,
300 miles away.
   It said Waldheim received leave papers Nov. 20 to start a ``rest
leave'' Nov. 23 in Austria.
   ``Due to this chronology, it is highly unlikely that Waldheim
had anything to do with Mr. Ogilvie's story,'' the organization
said in a statement.
   Ogilvie was quoted as saying he was found armed and in civilian
clothes Nov. 17, 1943, on the German-occupied Greek island of Leros.
   He was quoted as saying the Germans took him to an airfield
outside Athens where he met Waldheim, who introduced himself by
name and made sure Ogilvie and others went to a POW camp instead of
to the SS, which shot prisoners.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has ordered an
inquiry into the cases of six British commandos executed in 1944
after being delivered for interrogation to the Germany army unit in
which Waldheim served.
   A panel of historians found that Waldheim was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during army service in the Balkans,
knew of them and did not try to stop them, but it left open the
question of whether he committed war crimes. Waldheim has denied
wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of shooting his ex-wife's
parents and another person to death during an Easter funeral had
been feuding with his in-laws over a gate they had put up on land
next to his, neighbors said Monday.
   The man's mother-in-law wouldn't give him a right of way,
neighbors said.
   ``From what everyone is saying, they backed him into a corner,''
said Ted Russell, who works at a grocery store.
   Police said 41-year-old Michael Leslie Rainey of Fletcher opened
fire Sunday on mourners gathered for a relative's funeral at a
mountain church nestled among apple orchards and rhododendrons.
   His former in-laws, Wilford Owensby, 61, and Ponnelle Owensby,
60, both of Edneyville, and a 24-year-old man were slain,
authorities said. Three others, including his ex-wife, Andrea
Rainey, 40, of Kennesaw, Ga., were wounded.
   Rainey was charged with three counts of murder and three of
assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. He was ordered
held without bail Monday.
   Henderson County District Attorney Alan Leonard said he will
seek the death penalty.
   Sheriff's Capt. Tom Hatchett said the shootings apparently
stemmed from a argument over land in Edneyville, a town about 20
miles southeast of Asheville. Rainey owned land adjacent to
property belonging to Mrs. Rainey's family near the church.
   Rainey had sued the Owensby family in August, alleging the
Owensbys had erected a gate on a driveway extending across their
property and onto Rainey's. He charged that the locked gate
prevented him from getting to motor vehicles that he kept on his
property.
   According to court records, Rainey and his former wife were
given the land by his former wife's grandparents, D.T. and Effie
Justice, in 1979. Sunday's shooting occurred as Effie Justice's
funeral was about to begin.
   Railey won a preliminary injunction in August ordering the
Owensbys to open the gate.
   Nearly everyone interviewed in Edneyville on Monday knew about
the dispute.
   ``His mother-in-law wouldn't give him the right of way. He just
couldn't take it anymore. He had to walk to his own place,'' said
an elderly woman living nearby. She declined to give her name.
   Jim MacKenzie, who owns an auto supply store, said Rainey
stopped by the shop about three weeks ago to say he considering
selling his house and moving away. ``He said all of this was too
much trouble,'' MacKenzie said.
   ``He was a real nice guy, real happy-go-lucky,'' MacKenzie said.
``But anyone can be pushed too far. He was by no means a Charlie
Manson.''
   MacKenzie said Rainey had worked as an installer for Southern
Bell, the telephone company.
   In an interview, Roy Neill, assistant district attorney, said
Rainey was ``dangerous and unstable'' and had shot some victims
more than once, while they were down. ``This was not your
garden-variety murder,'' Neill said.

   The World Bank announced Monday a loan of $109
million to Brazil to fight AIDS and three other diseases in the

   It was the first time that the bank, which is owned by 151
countries, has lent money for AIDS in Latin America. Last December
the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the
African republic of Burundi was helped by financing from the fund.
   Brazil has 2,100 AIDS patients. Only the United States and
France have reported more.
   The loan to Brazil's Northeast Endemic Disease Control project
also will be used against schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis and
Chagas' disease, particularly widespread among poor people in the
area.
   Total cost of the project is put at $218 million. The loan is
for 15 years, including a three-year grace period during which only
interest need be paid. The World Bank charges a variable rate
beginning at 7.72 percent annually.

   Atlanta's police chief marked the anniversary of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s shooting Monday by condemning the National
Rifle Association and calling for ``sane'' handgun control laws in
full-page newspaper ads.
   Atlanta Public Safety Commissioner George Napper appeared in the
latest in a series of ads placed by Handgun Control, a
Washington-based lobbying group, featuring messages from leading
law enforcement officials.
   In the ad's headline, Napper asks, ``Cop-killer bullets,
mail-order handguns, machine guns ... has the N.R.A. gone off the
deep end?''
   In the text, he urges readers to mark this year's 25th
anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination and 20th
anniversary of the King and Robert Kennedy assassinations by
``sending Congress a message _ America wants sane handgun laws
now!''
   Napper advocates waiting periods for the purchase of handguns
and ``a national, uniform minimum standard of handgun laws.''
   He blasted the NRA's efforts to repeal federal, state and local
gun control laws and its defense of armor-piercing ``cop-killer''
bullets, privately owned machine guns and mail-order gun sales.
   Napper said Monday in a telephone interview that he has ``very
strong feelings about handguns ... the only purpose for a handgun
is to kill people.''
   Handgun Control officials said the Atlanta advertisements cost
them about $16,000, and that the two-year series of advertisements
has cost about $750,000.
   The group's vice-chairwoman, Sarah Brady, is the wife of Reagan
White House press secretary James Brady, who was permanently
disabled by pistol fire from would-be presidential assassin John
Hinckley. Both Kennedy and King were shot with rifles.

<HEAD>Students Attack Train as Violent Protests Break Out At Campuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students fought
riot police in clashes at two Seoul colleges Monday and others were
reported to have attacked a passenger train with firebombs and
rocks.
   At Sungkyunkwang and Konkuk universities in Seoul, hundreds of
riot police fired tear gas to block anti-government students from
marching into the streets. No arrests or injuries were reported.
   In the southern city of Chinju, press reports said a passenger
train was caught in a clash between police and about 1,200 students.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap said most passengers escaped
unhurt, but that a student barrage of firebombs and rocks shattered
at least 300 train windows and destroyed some seats.
   The violence at Chinju followed an anti-government rally at
nearby Kyongsang University, where students were protesting weekend
police action.
   Students said dozens of people were hurt Saturday when police
firing tear gas stormed the Kyongsang campus to disperse about
3,000 students and workers demanding a freer labor movement and a
boycott of agricultural imports.
   About 1,200 students from Hankook University occupied a road in
Seoul's southern shopping center Monday after boycotting a one-week
period of obligatory military training at army barracks.
   They cried, ``Down with the military dictatorship that forces us
to take mercenary training for Yankees!''
   The students denounced the government of President Roh Tae-woo
as a dictatorship.
   They also shouted slogans such as ``Drive out American economic
aggressors!'' They said the Roh government allows such
``aggression'' by accepting U.S. demands to open South Korean
markets.
   Violent campus demonstrations increased steeply in recent weeks
despite democratic reforms proposed by the government. Students
have called for full democracy, but government officials say recent
protests were organized by leftists trying to overthrow the
government by force.
   Roh, who succeeded Chun Doo-hwan as president in February,
pledged to end authoritarian rule but at the same time called for
stern punishment of violent protests to ensure stability.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Terry Branstad, who remained
neutral during Iowa's precinct caucuses, said Monday he has met
with Vice President George Bush about taking an active role in the
likely Republican presidential nominee's attempt to carry Iowa in
November.
   ``I intend to be actively involved in that campaign,'' Branstad
told reporters. He said he met with Bush after Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole, Bush's chief opponent, quit the race and thus virtually
assured that Bush will be the GOP presidential nominee.
   But Branstad said Iowa will not be fertile ground for the
Republicans in the election. ``I think we have to recognize it's
going to be an uphill battle for Republicans in Iowa this year,''
he said.
   Iowa has struggled through years of a farm-based recession, and
Republicans have had problems as Democratic ranks expanded in
protest of GOP farm policies.
   ``We're outnumbered in terms of registration,'' Branstad said.

   Democratic presidential candidates Jesse
Jackson and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois oppose opening the Shoreham
nuclear power plant on Long Island, according to material released
Monday by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``Shoreham should not be opened, in large part ... because of
the inherent problems of any possible evacuation in the event of an
emergency,'' Simon said in a letter to Moynihan. Jackson spokesman
Hulbert James told Moynihan aides that Jackson is against opening
the $5 billion plant.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis were more cautious but both said they would support
legislation to forbid the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from
licensing the plant without an emergency evacuation plan approved
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FEMA has said Long Island could not be safely evacuated without
the cooperation of state and local officials, who have refused to
participate in such planning. However, the NRC changed its own
rules last year to allow it to assume state and local officials
would cooperate in any actual nuclear emergency.
   The candidates responded to a March 31 letter in which Moynihan
asked their position on legislation he offered last year to require
the NRC to abide by FEMA's decision. The bill lost in committee.

   Top Iowa Democrats launched an offensive
Monday against backers of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   At a news conference, party leaders said they were worried that
expected low voter turnout in the June primary could be good news
for 16 LaRouche backers who filed as Democrats for legislative and
congressional seats.
   LaRouche backers are the only Democrats who have filed for the
June primary in two legislative districts, meaning they will appear
on the ballot as the Democratic candidates there.
   House Speaker Don Avenson said he'll campaign for the Republican
candidates there. ``I would much prefer to have a mainstream
Republican hold a legislative seat to a LaRouche supporter who has
... conspiratorial theories about the world,'' he said.

   A Mexican national being held for removal
to California denied on Monday that he is the man authorities want
to question in the 1985 torture-murder of U.S. narcotics agent
Enrique Camerena Salazar in Mexico.
   Authorities say Leonardo Contreras Subias, 42, also wanted on
drug distribution charges in Los Angeles, has been one of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agencies most hunted fugitives.
   ``He's one of our major, major fugitives, because of the drug
charges and also because of the agent's death,'' said Steve Lough,
agent-in-charge of the DEA's Salt Lake City office.
   Lough has said earlier that Subias is wanted only for
questioning and is not a suspect in Salazar's death.
   But the man who appeared in federal court here on Monday said he
is not Subias, but Jose Gonzalez Guillen. The man was arrested
Friday night while having dinner with his wife and children at a
downtown restaurant.
   Lough said the man, reportedly in Salt Lake City several times
in recent months, was arrested on a tip from a DEA task force
investigating Salazar's death.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald Boyce ordered the man held without bail
in the Salt Lake County Jail until a hearing Thursday to determine
his identity. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Schwendiman said
witnesses are en route from Los Angeles who can positively identify
the man as Subias.
   If his identity is confirmed, authorities will seek to remove
Subias to Los Angeles for questioning regarding Salazar's death and
for prosecution on one count of possession of a controlled
substance with intent to distribute and one count of distribution
of a controlled substance.
   Lough said the charges stem from the alleged sale of cocaine to
an undercover officer in 1980. Each count carries a maximum penalty
of 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   The defendant, who appeared to walk with a slight limp, asked
Boyce if he could be allowed to continue physical therapy for a
gunshot wound to the leg that still is healing. Boyce said that
would be up to the jail's medical staff.

   Four protesters accused of attacking the
battleship Iowa with hammers, boltcutters and vials of what
appeared to be blood will remain in jail rather than post bond, a
supporter said Monday.
   Longtime activist and former Catholic priest Philip Berrigan,
64, Gregory Boertje, 32, Andrew Lawrence, 28, and Sister Margaret
McKenna, 57, a member of the Medical Mission Sisters, all face
misdemeanor trespassing charges.
   ``They believe that in a corrupt world, their place is in jail.
They are not evading their respnsibility for their actions,'' said
Max Obuszewski. He said the four would not seek to leave jail under
bond.
   The four allegedly boarded the battleship with a tour group
Sunday, then slipped away and attacked two launching boxes holding
Tomahawk missiles.
   Magistrate Tommy Miller explained because the charge was petty
trespassing, the defendants had the choice of trial before a
magistrate or a district judge, but not before a jury.
   Miller set bond at $2,500 and continued the hearing until April
15, when a trial date will be set. No pleas were entered during the
appearance. If convicted each faces a maximum six months in jail
and fine of $500.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Martin would not comment on the
charges nor say why trespassing charges were filed rather than the
destruction of government property charges first indicated by
federal officials.
   The felony destruction charges would have given the defendants
the right to a jury trial.
   The four are members of Nuclear Navy Plowshares, an offshoot of
the Plowshares-Disarmament Actions, which has staged numerous
protests on nuclear weapons.
   The group takes its name from Isaiah 2:4, ``and they shall beat
their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war anymore.''
   In a joint statement distributed prior to the hearing by
Obuszewski, a national representative of the Plowshares group, the
four said:
   ``The USS Iowa is not a component, but a symbol of this
superstate madness... So we come to Norfolk bearing blood and
hammers _ symbols of another kind. They are symbols of repentance
and recreation, most appropriate to this season of resurrection and
rebirth.''
   Berrigan, Boertje and Lawrence are from Baltimore, and Sister
McKenna is from Fox Chase, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb.
   Berrigan, a former Josephite priest, first came to prominence as
a member of a group of draft protesters who threw blood on draft
cards May 17, 1968, at a selective service office in Catonsville,
Md., to protest the Vietnam War.
   In 1980, Berrigan, his brother, Daniel, and six associates
entered the General Electric plant in King of Prussia, Pa., and
hammered at Mark 12-A nuclear warheads.
   Boertje has been wanted by the FBI since he failed to show at
his Nov. 17, 1987, sentencing for allegedly damaging military
aircraft at Willow Grove Naval Air Station outside Philadelphia.
   According to the criminal complaint filed Monday by the FBI,
Berrigan and Sister McKenna appeared alongside the Iowa at the
Norfolk Naval Base on Saturday and questioned a sailor about the
ship's armament. Federal investigators said four protesters then
boarded the ship as part of an open house and attacked the two
launchers.
   Capt. Archie Galloway, a Navy spokesman, said the Navy normally
has two ships open to the public over the weekend. He said the four
protesters where apprehended by the ship's crew following their
demonstration.
   The Tomahawk missile, which can carry either a conventional or
nuclear warhead, is launched from surface ships, submarines and
aircraft.

<HEAD>China Plans to Cut Funds for Arts Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government will stop supporting more than
3,000 performing arts companies and let them make their own way in
the marketplace, an official newspaper said Monday.
   The plan worries some in China's 56 minority groups who fear
losing their cultural heritage, the English-language China Daily
said. It appears to be in keeping with recent steps away from the
20-year-old ``iron ricebowl'' policy guaranteeing workers food,
shelter and clothing regardless of their output.
   Gao Zhanxiang, vice minister of culture, said China will move
slowly in reforming the management and structure of arts companies,
the newspaper reported. He said 210,000 professional performers
will be affected.
   Recent developments show the need for reform, Gao said, and
proclaimed it the only way to revive and develop the performing
arts.
   Li Moran, a well-known stage actor, contended the plan would
throw products of the performing arts into the market as
commodities, China Daily reported.
   Critics were quoted as saying it would leave funding available
for only modern arts, leaving the traditional and minority fields
completely on their own.
   Members of traditional and minority musical, dance and opera
troupes ``have been especially furious with the proposed plans,''
China Daily said.
   Under the current system, central and local governments control
hiring, budgets and choice of programs. Under the new one,
companies would have financial autonomy but the government still
would set culture and entertainment policy.
   China Daily said most arts companies are overstaffed and
performers are paid according to seniority. It said Chinese theater
``has not satisfied the popular needs'' and lamented the loss of
talented artists to foreign countries. Arts in China suffered
heavily during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution against
intellectuals, which leading Chinese directors and actors say
created a shortage of able young performers.
   The Cultural Ministry said it will sponsor a national conference
next month to establish procedures for the reforms.

<TEXT>
   India paid Sri Lanka's main Tamil
separatist leader to cooperate with an agreement intended to end
the rebel war with the Sinhalese majority, the Indian ambassador
said Monday.
   J.N. Dixit said Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, asked for the money in New Delhi last July
to replace ``taxes'' his militia collected from people in Jaffna,
the main Tiger stronghold in northern Sri Lanka.
   ``India agreed to it and some money was paid,'' Dixit said.
   Since then, the Tigers rejected the peace accord signed last
July 29 by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and President
Junius R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka. Indian forces sent to enforce
it have been fighting the Tamil militia since October.
   More than 400 Indian soldiers and 1,000 Tamil militiamen have
been reported killed. About 7,000 people have been slain since the
Tamil war began in 1983.
   The newspaper Indian Post reported the payments in an article
Sunday. In confirming the story, Dixit said he did not know the
amount given Prabhakaran but it was enough ``to take care of his
requests at that point in time.''
   An unidentified Tiger spokesman was quoted in the Post as saying
the agreement with India was for $384,600 a month but no payment
was made after the first month. By then, the Tigers were
criticizing the peace accord.
   Gandhi negotiated the agreement after trying for nearly three
years to mediate peace between the Tamils and the government.
   Tamil militants want a Tamil nation called Eelam in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka.
   About 60 million Tamils live in India, most of them in Tamil
Nadu state across the narrow Palk Strait from Sri Lanka. Most
Tamils are Hindu and Sinhalese are predominantly Buddhist.
   Ethnic Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people and say the Sinhalese, who control the government and
military, discriminate against them.
   Dixit said Prabhakaran asked Gandhi for the money during
meetings in New Delhi before the peace agreement was signed.
   The Tigers did not sign the accord but agreed to give up almost
all their arms. The agreement calls for the rebels to disarm in
exchange for greater Tamil autonomy.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge denied a defense motion
Monday to dismiss three counts of a nine-count indictment against
the matriarch of a polygamist clan that held police at bay in a
13-day standoff.
   Vickie Singer is charged along with her son, John Timothy
Singer, clan leader Addam Swapp and his brother Jonathan in the
bombing of a Mormon chapel and the standoff that ended in a gun
battle Jan. 28.
   They are to go on trial Wednesday.
   Addam Swapp was wounded and Corrections Lt. Fred House was
killed when the siege reached its bloody climax at Marion, Utah.
   In the fifth day of pre-trial hearings, Mrs. Singer's defense
attorney, Kathryn Collard, argued that three counts against her
client should be dismissed because the bombed Kamas Stake Center
chapel was not involved in interstate commerce, but rather in
religious activities.
   That would imply that the three counts, which include charges of
bombing, attempting to kill federal officer, firearms violations,
assault and conspiracy, would not fall within federal jurisdiction,
Collard said.
   However, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lambert argued that the
statute was meant to be given a broad interpretation and that a
clause citing federal jurisdiction over ``any'' bombed building
should apply.
   Lambert said the stake center clearly was used for a variety of
interstate commerce activities, including collections that
ultimately go into the church general fund for use throughout the
nation and the world, a linkage to a worldwide satellite system,
and an international missionary network that begins at stake
centers.
   Collard countered that only business-related activities
constitute commerce and that church officials certainly would not
consider their activities as part of business.
   ``They take the position what they do is a furtherance of their
religious mission so they won't be taxed,'' she said.
   The bombing of the Mormon chapel allegedly was in revenge for
the death of Mrs. Singer's polygamist husband, John Singer, who was
killed in a confrontation with authorities nine years ago. Swapp is
married to two of Singer's daughters, and was a leader of the
family along with Mrs. Singer. They blamed the Mormon Church, of
which their group is an offshoot, and police in Singer's death.
   Swapp claimed a violent confrontation at the family's rural
compound would bring about Singer's ``resurrection.''

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday he could find no consensus for a Middle East peace
conference as called for by the General Assembly.
   There has been strong support in the United Nations for an
international peace conference that would include the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Israel, however, refuses to deal with the PLO, maintaining it is
a terrorist organization determined to destroy the Jewish state.
   The United States also rejects official contacts with the PLO
and while supporting an international conference says it should
only prepare for direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
   In a report issued Monday, Perez de Cuellar noted the U.S. and
Israeli positions and said ``sufficient agreement does not exist
either amongst the parties directly concerned or with the Security
Council to permit'' an international conference.
   ``Meanwhile, the recent and continuing events in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip have dramatically highlighted the urgent
need for the negotiation ... of a comprehensive, just and lasting
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' he said.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been rioting
since Dec. 8 against Israeli occupation.
   The General Assembly passed a resolution in December calling for
a U.N.-sponsored peace conference that would include the PLO and
the five permanent members of the Security Council: the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
   Washington is pursuing its own Middle East peace initiative and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz is now in the region on his
second tour within the past month.

<TEXT>
   A judge began a painstaking series of
interviews Monday with about 100 prospective jurors for the retrial
of a defendant originally sentenced to death in the notorious Alday
family slayings.
   Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson said he expected the jury
questioning for the retrial of Wayne Carl Coleman to last at least
through Friday.
   Coleman is one of three men who were convicted of six counts of
murder in the case in 1974 and sentenced to die. Those convictions
were overturned in 1985 by a federal appeals court, which said
publicity about the case in tiny Seminole County made it impossible
for the three to get fair trials there.
   Defense lawyer Robert H. Citronberg referred to Coleman's
original trial in arguing that potential jurors should not see
Seminole County Sheriff Jerry Godby in the courtroom while they are
being interviewed for the retrial in DeKalb County.
   Lawson refused to bar Godby, saying prospective jurors were
unlikely to notice him since he was not in uniform.
   The judge then began calling prospective jurors one at a time,
asking them if they had any moral objections to the death penalty
and if they could make the life-or-death choices in a capital
murder case.
   Citronberg and fellow defense lawyer Tom West asked if the
prospective jurors would be sympathetic to a defendant's mental
condition, deprived upbringing and alcohol or drug abuse.
   Lawson called the questioning a preliminary screening procedure,
with final selection of jurors possible next week. The jury will be
sequestered for one to two weeks of testimony in the trial, the
judge said.
   Coleman, his half-brother Carl Isaacs and George Dungee were
escapees from a Maryland prison when they were arrested for the
slayings of six members of the Ned Alday family in extreme
southwestern Georgia.
   Alday, his brother and three sons were shot one by one on May
14, 1973, when they arrived at the home of one of the sons, where
Coleman and his companions were interrupted in a burglary,
according to testimony.
   The wife of one of Alday's sons was taken to a wood six miles
away where she was raped and killed.
   Isaacs was again convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a
retrial in Perry in January. Dungee is to be retried in Columbus
after Coleman's retrial.

calling attention to the plight of the poor.
   ``Until we wipe out poverty in the ghetto nowhere can be safe.
Nowhere can be secure, for one hungry person speaks in misery to
everybody,'' said Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights organization
founded by King.
   ``There ain't going to be no peace in the suburbs until there is
justice in the ghetto,'' Lowery told about 3,000 people who marched
a mile and a half through downtown Memphis to The Lorraine Motel.
   King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, while in Memphis to
support a strike by city sanitation workers. He also was conducting
a nationwide campaign to draw attention to poverty.
   The day before he was shot, King delivered his last public
address, saying, ``I've been to the mountain top ... and I've seen
the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to
know tonight, that we as a people will get to the promised land.''
   Fifty members of Lowery's organization were scheduled to leave
from the motel Monday on a combination march and motorcade through
Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, but the ``poor people's
pilgrimage'' was delayed a day because two mules did not arrive on
time.
   The mules are a symbol of poverty, Lowery said, and a wagon they
were to pull is similar to one used for King's funeral in Atlanta.
   The Lorraine itself has become something of a symbol of poverty.
At one time, the motel had about 60 rooms, but the decaying
two-story building had only 12 rooms in use when the state closed
it in January to make way for a museum. Opponents of the museum
project, say the money should be spent turning The Lorraine into
housing for the homeless.
   D'Army Bailey, a Memphis lawyer who spearheaded a push to get
$8.8 million from the state and local governments for museum, said
the project will be a fitting tribute to King.
   ``See the years of neglect that have gone on at this holy
site,'' Bailey said. ``What kind of tribute ... has that signaled
... about the struggle for which that great man gave his life.''
   Prior to the march to The Lorraine, the city held a memorial
service in King's honor at the Orpheum Theater, a downtown
landmark. The service included gospel singing, songs by a group of
grammar school children and a dance, titled ``Love Has No Color.''
   It was the first city-sponsored memorial to the slain Nobel
Peace Prize winner.
   Mayor Richard Hackett, who appointed the commission that
organized Memphis' first memorial for the slain civil rights
leader, said it is time for the city where King died to better
organize its efforts to help the poor.
   ``Twenty years ago, Dr. King spoke of a dream. Today, this city
recognizes the necessity for that dream to become a reality,''
Hackett said. ``It is right. It is just, and it is in the best
interest of us all.''
   The sanitation workers protest that drew King to Memphis set off
a tense and sometimes violent confrontation between strikers and
city police. Gerald McEntee, international president of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
the SCLC march on the 20th anniversary of King's death showed that
those conflicts have lessened greatly.
   ``This time, the mayor of Memphis, Tenn., and the members of
Local 1733 will be walking arm and arm. We are together,'' McEntee
said. ``There could be no more fitting memorial to the man we're
here to honor and for the dream he died for.''
   William Lucy, international secretary-treasurer of the union,
said he was especially encouraged by the performances of the
youngsters taking part in the King memorial.
   ``This is what Dr. King had hoped for, that in the future it
would be young people to bring about change,'' Lucy said. ``There
may be some folks in Memphis who think that change isn't even
within their capacity.
   ``But the children will make it happen.''

   National leaders of the Assemblies of
God have taken no action on Jimmy Swaggart following the
evangelist's most emotional church speech since he stepped down
from the pulpit, a denomination spokeswoman said Monday.
   Swaggart received a favorable response Sunday night from the
crowd at his Family Worship Center, but officials of the Assemblies
of God said his appearances during Easter services would have
violated the terms of a one-year ban on preaching it ordered last
week.
   Taking the microphone briefly during Sunday night's service,
Swaggart paced and shouted into the microphone.
   ``It works! It works!,'' he said, shaking a Bible as he does
when he preaches. ``If there is a reporter here, spread the word
everywhere. It works!''
   The Rev. Everett Stenhouse, assistant general superintendent for
the Assemblies of God, said Swaggart's appearance would have
violated the one-year ban.
   But because Swaggart has not signed any agreement, he has not
submitted to the church's rehabilitation program, Stenhouse said in
a telephone interview from Springfield, Mo., the church's national
headquarters.
   The church's General Presbytery last Tuesday banned Swaggart
from the pulpit for at least a year for ``moral failure.'' A
self-described prostitute has said Swaggart paid her to pose nude
for him.
   Swaggart must decide this week whether to accept the
disciplinary action, a choice that could affect the future of his
financially troubled ministry. He said through his attorney last
week that he will defy the order and return to the pulpit May 22.
   Juleen Turnage, a national church spokeswoman, criticized
Swaggart's appearances Sunday and said he probably would face
expulsion if he did not quickly accept the church's discipline.
   ``I know our executives want to give him sufficient time to
respond to their written notification, and I would think that maybe
by the end of this week, if they have not heard from him, the
executives will be looking at what further steps they can take to
bring this to a close,'' she said.
   The 13 members of the denomination's executive presbytery held a
telephone conference on Monday, but took no action, Turnage said.
   ``We still have not heard from Jimmy Swaggart. We're still
waiting to hear,'' Turnage said.
   Swaggart spokeswoman LeAnne Weill said Monday that Swaggart had
not sent the denomination a response and had not set a date for
doing so.
   After an earlier service Sunday morning, Swaggart launched into
a talk on the love of Christ when a reporter asked if he was
leaving the Assemblies of God.
   A heckler had disrupted the morning service to accuse the
evangelist of hypocrisy.
   ``Brother Swaggart, your hypocrisy is scornful of the government
of God,'' the young man, about 16 years old, yelled during a brief
lull in the service.
   Swaggart, who has not been preaching since tearfully confessing
to an unspecified sin on Feb. 21, was sitting on the church's stage
at the time of the outburst with his wife, Frances, and other
church leaders. Swaggart did not visibly react to the heckler.
   The Rev. Jim Rentz, who has taken over as pastor, watched the
youth for only a moment and then told worshipers, ``Let's stand
folks and let's just praise the Lord.''
   Rentz and the congregation drowned out the youth until he was
escorted away by ushers. During his brief outburst, the youth also
referred to ``immoral sins'' and ``money.''
   The incident came after Swaggart spoke briefly as he introduced
a musical duet.

   Hooded gunmen encircled about 500 people
at a Easter festival in a village plaza and fired for half an hour
at the screaming crowd, killing 33 and wounding eight, a survivor
said Monday.
   Right-wing death squads in Colombia usually wear hoods. The
attackers at the small village of Mejor Esquina in northern
Colombia also were wearing army uniforms, frequently used by death
squads.
   A survivor, Segundo Benitez, said he counted the dead and
wounded in the Sunday massacre. He said a brother, two nephews and
a cousin of his were among the dead. Benitez said there were 10 to
15 attackers.
   ``The one in charge shouted `Kill everyone you can!''' Benitez
said in an interview with the Colombian radio chain Caracol.
   ``They just shot at everybody, at those who were dancing and
those who tried to run away.
   ``They made a lot of the people lie down on the ground and then
shot them in the head.''
   Benitez said men, women, old people and children were among the
victims.
   Mejor Esquina, in Cordoba state, was celebrating the end of Holy
Week. It is a village of about 600 and lies about 280 miles
northwest of Bogota, the capital.
   Enrique Llorente Lopez, the mayor of the nearby town of
Buenavista, said earlier that about 10 men arrived in vehicles
Sunday night at Mejor Esquina. He had heard that 28 people were
killed.
   Cordoba Gov. Jose Miguel Amin said in a broadcast interview with
Caracol that the police told him they did not know who attacked the
townspeople.
   However, in the town of Planeta Rica, a few miles from the
massacre, someone had painted on a building's walls, ``The
Magnificient Ones are here to clean things up.''
   There are more than a dozen right-wing death squads in Colombia,
with names like the Vampires and the Crickets. The Manificient Ones
was a new name.
   Mejor Esquina is in the heart of a mountainous area where a
left-wing guerrilla group, the People's Liberation Army, has been
organizing lately.
   Sunday's attack was the second massacre in Colombia in a month.
   On March 4, a right-wing death squad fired on sleeping workers
at a ranch in northwest Colombia and killed 20 of them.
   Death squads have killed more than 600 people in Colombia in the
last three years.

<HEAD>Letters From Cabinet Members, Lawmakers Support Probation for
Nofziger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of President Reagan's Cabinet and
four members of Congress have written letters of support for Lyn
Nofziger to the judge who will sentence the former presidential
aide for illegal lobbying.
   The letters from Energy Secretary John S. Herrington and Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin were among 62 from current and former
government officials that were filed Monday with a defense memo
that urged Nofziger serve a period of unsupervised probation.
   Letters also were sent by Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; Reps. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y.; Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md.; Mervyn Dymally,
D-Calif.; ex-Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev.; and former Health and Human
Services Secretary Margaret M. Heckler, now ambassador to Ireland.
   In one letter, Secret Service director John R. Simpson vouched
for the defendant's reliability and integrity, recalling when
Nofziger became the White House spokesman after President Reagan
was shot on March 30, 1981.
   ``Once Mr. Nofziger took the podium,'' Simpson said he was
quickly aware of ``the rapport and trust the press had for any
statements he made.''
   Nofziger, 63, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Flannery for illegally lobbying on behalf of
Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineers' union and the manufacturer of
the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.
   The former White House political director could receive a
two-year prison term and be fined as much as $10,000 for each of
the three felony convictions for lobbying ex-colleagues within a
year of leaving the president's staff.
   In its filing, Nofziger's lawyers accused independent counsel
James C. McKay of making a ``vindictive'' and ``mean-spirited''
request for imprisonment. The defense said a prison term ``would
unnecessarily add to the degradation and humiliation Mr. Nofziger
has already suffered as a result of his indictment and trial.''
   ``It is inconceivable that a sentence other than probation is
appropriate under these circumstances,'' said the sentencing memo
filed by defense lawyers Robert Plotkin and E. Lawrence Barcella.
   The letters attached to the sentencing memo were from current
and former Reagan administration officials, personal friends and
political associates of Nofziger who vouched for his character and
integrity.
   ``He has always been a man who cares more for the good of a
cause than for personal gain,'' wrote Kemp, who urged the judge to
balance ``the requirements of justice with the quality of mercy.''
   In a three-page letter, Herrington urged Flannery to ``show
compassion and understanding'' for Nofziger.
   ``Society has been paid by what he has gone through in this
trial and the effect that it has had on him as an individual,'' the
secretary said.
   ``Lyn Nofziger will never engage in this activity again in any
way, shape or form, and my fear is that he will probably never
participate in politics again. And I think that will be a shame,''
Herrington said.
   In a memo filed last week, McKay said Nofziger had unjustly
enriched himself after leaving the White House in early 1982,
amassing a current net worth of $2.8 million.
   McKay said Nofziger deliberately ignored the Ethics in
Government Act restrictions on lobbying and showed no remorse after
his conviction in February.
   Plotkin and Barcella said Nofziger's legal bills total $1.4
million and will increase when the conviction is appealed.
   The defense said Nofziger ``does not dispute the need for fair,
clear and balanced post-employment restrictions'' but contended
that if the statute were clearer, ``Mr. Nofziger likely would not
be before the court for sentencing.''

   Guerrillas of the Marxist group Shining
Path dragged the administrator of a large farm and his wife off a
bus and shot them to death, officials reported Monday.
   Police said Mr. and Mrs. Zozino Huaman were killed Sunday
afternoon by three hooded gunmen who stopped a bus belonging to the
farm 42 miles northwest of this state capital, which is 140 miles
east of Lima.
   Eleven other passengers and the driver were with the Huamans on
the bus, the reports said.
   A sign bearing the message ``This is the way traitors die'' and
a drawing of a hammer and sickle was found beside the bodies,
according to police.
   Shining Path began fighting in 1980 and the violence has spread
to most of the country. More than 10,000 non-combatants, rebels,
police, soldiers and public officials have been killed.

   An electronic signal system to
find lost climbers was unveiled Monday and dedicated to nine people
who died on Mount Hood two years ago.
   Two young climbers who survived the state's worst mountaineering
disaster attended the ceremony. The frustrating search for
survivors led to an effort to develop and pay for the tiny signal
devices to be worn by climbers.
   ``Every now and then it unfortunately takes a tragedy to make us
aware of needs that always existed,'' U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., said at the ceremony.
   Seven teen-agers and two faculty members from the Oregon
Episcopal School in Portland died in May 1986 after getting lost in
a blizzard near the summit of the 11,235-foot peek about 50 miles
east of Portland. Four climbers survived.
   The U.S. Forest Service estimates more than 10,000 people climb
Mount Hood each year. Since 1896, more than 50 people have died on
the mountain.
   The signal system, called the Mount Hood Locator Unit, consists
of a small, 8-ounce transmitter that is worn on a harness over the
climber's torso. When the climber is lost, he or she pulls a cord
to activate a continuous beep over a VHF radio frequency.
   When the climber is reported overdue, search and rescue groups
can use special receivers to pick up the beep, which grows louder
the closer the receiver gets to the transmitter.
   The battery-powered transmitter will send the signal at least 20
miles and can be picked up under 6 feet of snow and as deep as 75
feet in an open crevasse.
   Brinton Clark, now 17, made her first public statement since the
tragedy and thanked those who took part in the search two years
ago. ``Your dedication is the reason I'm here today,'' she said.
   Giles Thompson, now 18, of Longview, Wash., lost both legs to
frostbite and was interrupted by applause when he announced he
planned to go skiing.
   ``And I wouldn't be going skiing if it wasn't for the efforts of
a lot of people,'' he added.
   A hundred transmitters will be available for climbers to rent
for a maximum of $5 at any of six mountaineering shops in the
Portland area, said Scott Russell, co-chairman of the Mountain
Signal Memorial Fund. Use of the device is not mandatory.
   The device was developed by Telonics Inc. of Phoenix, Ariz.
Although similar devices have been used to track wildlife,
companies had not adapted one for human use because of the
potential liability if the device should fail.
   Organizers of the signal fund convinced the Oregon Legislature
to pass a liability exemption last year.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Monday
sidestepped differences with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on a
Middle East peace conference and kept a U.S. plan alive by focusing
on Palestinian self-rule.
   ``We do have a sense of movement,'' a senior U.S. official told
reporters after Shultz met separately with Shamir, Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   A senior Israeli defense official, however, said the government
remained deadlocked and the only way to gain acceptance of the plan
would be for Shultz to persuade King Hussein of Jordan to accept it.
   ``I feel it can bring about a change,'' the official told
American reporters in a briefing held under rules that barred
identifying him.
   In another development, Israel television said Monday night that
Israel and the United States were preparing a new memorandum of
understanding to serve as an official basis for strategic,
political and economic cooperation.
   It said the memorandum will be signed by President Reagan and
President Chaim Herzog in separate ceremonies in Washington and
Jerusalem on May 21, the 40th anniversary of Israel's independence.
The report did not elaborate on the memorandum.
   Shultz will hold talks with Hussein in Amman on Tuesday, return
to Jerusalem with a report for Israeli leaders and shuttle back to
the king on Wednesday.
   The U.S. plan calls for three years of self-rule, but not
statehood, for the 1.5 million Palestinian living in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations on an overall settlement
would open in December.
   Although Shultz set a mid-March deadline for a reply, Israel,
Jordan and Syria have all held back _ neither accepting nor
rejecting the U.S. plan.
   After Shultz met with Shamir for two hours Monday, a spokesman
for the prime minister said they were still in disagreement over a
Middle East peace conference and talks Shultz held with two members
of the Palestine National Council in Washington nine days ago.
   But the spokesman, Avi Pazner, said there was ``more
convergence'' between Shultz and Shamir on Palestinian self-rule
and an overall settlement.
   Similarly, Peres said after his two-hour session with Shultz
that he believed ``we moved forward even if the road is still long.
We went beyond the international conference.''
   Peres told reporters: ``We talked about the substance and form
of an interim agreement.''
   Shultz, meanwhile, said he was encouraged that ``we have now
engaged in this initiative in the important aspects of its content,
namely direct face-to-face negotiations.''
   Despite reassurances from Shultz that the United States would
stand by Israel, Shamir contends an international conference would
offer an opportunity for the Soviet Union to get in the way of
direct negotiations with the Arabs and impose an unacceptable
settlement.
   Shultz, on his second visit to the area in a month, also offered
assurances the United States would oppose a Palestinian state and
counter efforts to force Israel to retreat to its pre-1967 borders.
   However, he emphasized Sunday that negotiations must be based on
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which calls on Israel to
yield West Bank and Gaza territory.
   Shamir described his meeting with Shultz as ``a very good and
basic discussion.''
   Shultz's plan for Arab-Israeli negotiations has failed to defuse
Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and Gaza.
   In Amman, meanwhile, more than 500 Moslem fundamentalist
students, chanting ``Shultz the devil should go home,'' burned U.S.
and Israeli flags in a protest rally Monday on the Jordan
University campus.
   There were other demonstrations in the Arab kingdom, where
Palestinians are in the majority. Shultz's plan would include
Palestinians approved by the Palestine Liberation Organization in a
joint delegation with Jordan.
   Syria, the PLO and Egypt have called for a direct role for the
PLO in the negotiations, while Hussein's position is not known.
According to some U.S. accounts, he has accepted the idea of a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   But reporters traveling with Shultz last month to Amman were
told Jordan wanted PLO participation.
   According to U.N. figures, 137 Palestinians and an Israeli
soldier were killed in clashes since Dec. 8. There was one
Palestinian death on Monday.
   The Israeli defense official who briefed reporters said Israeli
forces were trying to reduce the level of violence but, ``We have
to drive home to the heart and mind we mean business and want
tranquility.''
   With the Israeli Cabinet evenly divided on whether to accept or
reject Shultz's plan, the official said its future ``very much
depends on the attitude of the other parties. Jordan is the key.''
   If Hussein accepts Shultz's proposal in principle, the Israeli
official said, ``I feel it can bring a change.''

<HEAD>(Misuse of Funds)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. On or about May 27, 1987, the Mecham Inaugural Committee
transferred the sum of $92,910.35 to the Office of the Governor. On
or about July 16, 1987, Evan Mecham, while acting in his official
capacity as Governor of the State of Arizona, personally and
knowingly directed and-or authorized James Colter, the Governor's
Chief of Staff, to make a loan of $80,000.00 out of funds held by
the Office of the Governor pursuant to A.R.S. Section 41-1105, to
Mecham Pontiac Corporation, the stock of which was owned by Evan
Mecham and his wife. The loan to Mecham Pontiac Corporation was
without lawful authority and was a knowing unauthorized use, for an
unauthorized term, of property of another, which property had been
entrusted to the Office of the Governor or placed in the possession
of the Office of the Governor for a limited authorized use. When
the loan was made, it was not made for the purpose of promoting the
interests of the State or to promote and encourage citizen public
service to the State pursuant to A.R.S. Section 41-1105, and
furthermore was made in violation of A.R.S. Sections 13-1802 and
35-301;
   B. The monies loaned to Mecham Pontiac Corporation referred to
in Article III(A) were obtained by the Office of the Governor
pursuant to a settlement with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office
in which the Maricopa County Attorney agreed not to charge Evan
Mecham's Inaugural Committee with a violation of A.R.S. Section
16-905 if the monies remaining in the Mecham Inaugural Committee
account were transferred to the Office of the Governor to be held
and expended pursuant to A.R.S. Section 41-1105. If the loan to
Mecham Pontiac Corporation was not made from monies held by the
Office of the Governor pursant to A.R.S. Section 41-1105 and-or the
monies were not public monies, the monies were obtained by Evan
Mecham in violation of A.R.S. Sections 16-905, 13-2310 and 13-2311,
and-or said loan was made in violation of A.R.S. Sections 16-905
and 13-1802;
   C. By undertaking each of the acts set forth in this Article,
Evan Mecham disregarded and thereby violated the solemn oath of the
Office of Governor that he took pursuant to A.R.S. Section 38-231;
or
   D. Each of the acts set forth in this Article were undertaken by
Evan Mecham without lawful authority, and were positively wrong or
unlawful, or constituted an abuse of official power, neglect or
duty, corruption, obstruction of justice, betrayal of public trsut,
misapplication of funds and-or were in breach of his trust and
fiduciary responsibilities.

<HEAD>Art Dealer Held Under Britain's Secrets Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland Yard announced Monday night that art
dealer Erwin van Haarlem will be charged under the anti-espionage
Official Secrets Act and news reports said the case involved the
KGB and British underwater research.
   London's Daily Express said earlier Monday the arrest involved a
Soviet spy ring seeking sensitive details about how NATO tracks
Soviet submarines heading into the Atlantic from their base at Kola
near Murmansk on the Barents Sea.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
regulations, would say only that van Haarlem will appear in a
London court Tuesday to be charged under the secrets act. Police
released no details.
   Van Haarlem, 43, was arrested in his north London apartment
Saturday and was questioned for two days by Special Branch, the
police department responsible for political security.
   Britain has long been a world leader in underwater warfare
detection methods and the underwater warfare development center at
Portland on the English south coast was the target of a Soviet spy
ring cracked in 1962.
   The Daily Express said Britain's MI5 counter-espionage agency
ordered van Haarlem's arrest after it investigated spying
operations against the government underwater research center at
Bath in western England.
   Other British news reports said that while van Haarlem claimed
to be Dutch-born, he was a Czechoslovak citizen employed by the
Soviet KGB secret police.
   Officials at the Dutch and Czechoslovak embassies in London
denied knowing anything of van Haarlem.

Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper on Monday linked Western
broadcasts and an Armenian dissident to ethnic violence in the
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The Communist newspaper Pravda called Armenian nationalist
Paruyr Ayrikyan, who is under arrest, a ``former criminal who has
engaged in the fanning up of national division.'' It said Ayrikyan
and the Western news media are ``like Siamese twins.''
   Pravda specifically criticized the British Broadcasting Corp.,
the Voice of America and Radio Liberty for their coverage of the
riots and protests in the two Soviet republics and said:
   ``Their masters have their own interest here. They hope to put
an end to socialism by dragging it piecemeal to separate national
compartments. In the same stride they try also to defame
restructuring in our society and the process of its
democratization.''
   Ayrikyan, who was a political prisoner for 17 years, emerged as
a spokesman for activists shortly after Armenians began
demonstrating Feb. 13 for annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region
from neighboring Azerbaijan. He traveled to Moscow and held two
news conferences for foreign journalists.
   Western journalists have been barred from traveling to Armenia
and Azerbaijan and telephone calls to the region go through only
sporadically.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the mainly Moslem Azerbaijan
republic since 1923, although more than three-quarters of the
region's 160,000 residents are Armenians, most of whom are
Christians.
   The annexation issue touched off rioting in the Azerbaijan city
of Sumgait that left 32 people dead. Officials confirmed that most
of those killed were Armenians.
   Instead of agreeing to the annexation demand, the Communist
Party and government offered a $690 million program of improved
housing and social services, such as Armenian language schools and
television broadcasts in Armenian.
   Ayrikyan, 38, was leader of an underground Armenian nationalist
group called the National Unification Party and was jailed for 17
years beginning in 1969 for his political activities. He now is
chairman of the Alliance for National Self-Determination.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman last week confirmed that Ayrikyan
had been arrested, but said he did not know on what charge.
Ayrikyan's relatives told Moscow dissidents that he was charged
under a law that prohibits spreading of false information
discrediting the Soviet Union.

   Two of five hunger strikers who have
been fasting for 22 days in the main hall of the National Congress
are suffering from kidney ailments, a doctor said Monday.
   Two university students, two professors and one university
worker began their fast March 14 in support of a strike by
university faculty members demanding 43 percent salary increases.
   Students Aldrin Torres, 22, and Luis Mendoza, 25, have
``symptoms of kidney infection,'' said Dr. Leon Uzcategui after
examining the five hunger strikers Monday morning. ``Mendoza also
seems to suffer from a liver problem now,'' he said.
   The strike by 40,000 teachers and administrative employees began
in January and has affected nearly 500,000 students.
   A government offer of a 5 percent wage increase was rejected by
the strikers. The government said it could not afford to offer more.
   Salaries for full-time university teachers ramge from the
equivalent of $550 per month to $1,380 per month.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sweeping ordinance restricting or banning
smoking in most New York City public places goes into effect
Wednesday, but officials say it may take months to sort out the
rules and effects.
   The measure _ the result of six years of battle _ restricts
smoking in workplaces, restaurants, banks, hospitals, hotels,
theaters, large stores and even taxicabs.
   But enforcement is likely to be clouded by unclear wording in
the ordinance, delays in related regulations and conflicting
messages from the Health Department.
   ``You're talking about a complex social change in a city of 8
million people,'' said Dr. Stephen Joseph, city health
commissioner. ``You don't expect a social change to take place at
the stroke of midnight.''
   Some of the confusion has been sown by Joseph's own department.
It opened a phone line to take questions on the new law, and an
operator mistakenly told a caller last week that the law has been
postponed until further notice.
   Hotel, restaurant and business associations say their members
have been briefed and are prepared to obey, however reluctantly.
   ``For the past few weeks they have been pulling their hair out,
trying to figure out what to do to comply,'' said Cynthia R.
Darrison, head of the Restaurant League of New York.
   Under the ordinance, restaurants with more than 50 seats _ there
are perhaps 5,000 of them _ must ban smoking at half the tables.
   In its most far-reaching section, businesses with more than 15
employees must provide non-smoking work areas designated by signs
and issue written policies on smoking.
   But the regulations for signs are not out yet and the written
policies are not due until July 5, and the result has been
confusion in the business community.
   Irwin S. Davison, Health Department counsel, said the city will
allow a two-month grace period before issuing tickets, which carry
fines up to $500 for repeat offenses.
   Even after June, the department intends the ordinance to be
chiefly ``self-enforcing,'' meaning it hopes the public will keep
employers and shopkeepers in compliance, Joseph said.
   The ordinance defines a smoke-free workplace as one at least
eight feet from a smoker. Some companies call that arrangement too
difficult to configure or enforce.
   The New York Post is banning smoking entirely in its offices; so
will The Associated Press.
   ``We don't feel it's right to allow smoking for people who have
offices and ban it for people who don't,'' said Wick Temple, AP
director of human resources. ``It's a matter of fairness.''
   For restaurants, breaking dining rooms into smoking and
no-smoking areas means regular customers may have to change their
habits if they want their usual tables. And there could be a line
for one area while tables are free in the other.
   ``This is New York. You could have fistfights in restaurants,''
said Ms. Darrison of the Restaurant League.

<HEAD>North Korea Says Japanese Sanctions Block Return Of Ship Crewmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese sanctions against North Korea imposed
after the disappearance of a South Korean airliner last November
have blocked chances for the return of two Japanese sailors held by
North Korea, it was reported Monday.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the
Japanese government's attempts to negotiate the return of the
sailors through third countries following its ban on direct
contacts with North Korean officials were a ``shameless and crafty
trick to mislead public opinion at home and abroad.''
   The two crewmen from the ship Fujisan-maru No. 18 were seized in
1983 when the vessel returned to North Korea after an earlier
voyage during which a North Korean stowed away aboard the ship and
disembarked in Japan.
   The crewmen were held for years without trial, apparently to
reinforce North Korean demands for the return of the stowaway, and
then were convicted last year on spying charges and sentenced to 15
years in prison.
   Although Japan has no formal diplomatic relations with communist
North Korea, Foreign Ministry officials said the two sides held
talks several times last year on the fate of the crewmen.
   But in January, Japan imposed sanctions on North Korea,
including restrictions on contacts between official
representatives, following the Nov. 29 disappearance of a Korean
Air jetliner carrying 115 people. The plane disappeared while
flying over Burma and South Korea claimed North Korean agents had
planted a bomb aboard the plane.
   Japan also blamed North Korea, which denied any involvement.
   ``The Japanese government itself blocked the road of the
solution of the crewmen's problem by severing contact between
(North) Korean and Japanese diplomats,'' the Korean Central News
Agency said in a dispatch monitored in Tokyo.

   Mark Christopher DuBois, a tenor with the
Canadian Opera Company, has been charged with sexual assault after
a woman said she was raped at knifepoint by a man who lured her
into his car, police reported.
   Police Sgt. Jim Walsh said the woman, who was not identified,
told police she was standing at a bus stop last week when a car
driver approached and asked for directions. Walsh reported the
driver asked the 21-year-old woman to get into his car and when she
did he drew a knife and sexually assaulted her.
   Walsh said charges have been filed against DuBois, 34.
   ``It's been quite a shock to us,'' said Sara Angelucci,
spokeswoman for the opera company.
   She said DuBois had appeared this year in the company's
production of ``The Merry Widow'' but canceled another scheduled
appearance because of a respiratory illness and exhaustion.
   DuBois made his London debut at Wigmore Hall in 1986 to good
reviews. He has played leading roles with the Canadian Opera
Company and other companies in both Canada and the United States.

   Reagan administration officials gently rebuked
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson on Monday for his
contacts with Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega,
contending that such communications could prolong his hold on power.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
``proliferation of channels is a tactic Noriega likes to use to buy
time.''
   She added: ``We have available channels of communication with
Noriega if and when they are needed. We think it would be best to
continue to use these channels exclusively.''
   Jackson disclosed that he sent a letter to Noriega on March 22
urging him to depart Panama. He said a response he had received
from Noriega will be sent to Secretary of State George P. Shultz
and appropriate members of Congress.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President
Reagan in California, professed bewilderment at Jackson's
activities, saying, ``We haven't heard from Jesse, so we're not
sure what kind of a proposal he has made. ... We just don't know
what he has in mind.''
   Fitzwater said he was confident that Noriega will resign.
   ``The economic sanctions are in place. We think their impact
will be significant, and things are only going to get more
difficult there for Noriega,'' Fitzwater told reporters covering
Reagan while the president vacations at his ranch near Santa
Barbara.
   Jackson, appearing Monday in Milwaukee, renewed his call for
Noriega to leave Panama and released a letter in which Noriega
rejected ``any political and economic program that will be dictated
from Washington, D.C.''
   ``My duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is
governed by the Panamanian constitution and law of the defense
forces,'' Noriega's letter said.
   While releasing the letter, Jackson renewed his call for Noriega
to step down.
   ``I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the
Panamanian people for General Noriega to leave. Today I reiterate
my public moral appeal for him to depart,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson told reporters he spoke by telephone Monday afternoon
with high-ranking State Department officials who offered no
disagreement with his appeal for Noriega to leave.
   He said the officials _ John C. Whitehead, the deputy secretary
of state, and Michael H. Armacost, undersecretary of state for
political affairs _ made no suggestion that he should tone down his
efforts or be more cautious in dealing with Noriega.
   On Sunday, Jackson had said during a campaign stop in Denver
that he had offered to do whatever he could ``to facilitate''
Noriega's exit from Panama but he ruled out a mediating role for
himself.
   Jackson said a friend, Cirilo McSween of Chicago, had gone to
Panama at his request to meet with Noriega. Jackson described
McSween as a friend of 20 years who was originally from Panama.
   Using rhetoric from his recent speeches, Jackson said U.S.
policy has been misguided:
   ``We've set the forest on fire to smoke one person out,'' he
said, referring to U.S. economic sanctions that have contributed to
a financial collapse in Panama. Jackson said he did not plan a trip
to Panama.
   Fitzwater also criticized Jackson's involvement in the Noriega
matter. ``We have a bipartisan coordinated plan for dealing with
Noriega. That's why it's important to Congress and the public, and
we believe it's been working,'' he said.
   ``Jesse's been involved in a number of these kinds of mediation
efforts. He's offered to go to Libya and Cuba and all kinds of
places,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked about published accounts over the weekend in which deposed
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle rejected any notion of
U.S. military force to get Noriega out, Fitzwater replied, ``He
says that because he thinks the economic sanctions are working,
that we just need to give these things a chance to kind of
percolate through the system, rather than try to take any more
action.''
   Fitzwater reiterated that the United States plans no further
immediate steps beyond the economic sanctions and the deployment
Tuesday of an additional 1,300 U.S. military forces to the troubled
country.
   He said the troops were ``to reinforce our security efforts in
Panama, to make sure we have the capability of protecting American
citizens there if that should become necessary. But there's no
steps beyond that at this point.''
   Mrs. Oakley, meanwhile, escalated the administration's criticism
of Panamanian authorities over an incident Sunday in which U.S.
Ambassador Arthur Davis was pursued for two miles in Panama City by
a government military vehicle with its siren blaring.
   ``We consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to be
serious as always,'' she said. ``We will take the necessary steps
to protect Americans. I am condemning the incident from the podium;
we regard the action as deliberate harassment.''
   Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone said Davis was leaving the
home of Vatican Ambassador Jose Sebastian Laboa when the Panamanian
vehicle ``began following immediately, picking them up right
outside the gate.'' He said it tried to stop the chauffeur-driven
car with its lights and sirens.
   ``The ambassador's driver, in accordance with instructions, did
not stop. The ambassador was driven to his residence, and the other
vehicle followed all the way,'' Kneebone said. The residences are
about two miles apart.

   Sen. Paul Simon campaigned in a motorcycle
factory Monday, in a final bid to rev up his faltering presidential
bid in time for the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary on
Tuesday.
   ``I'm going to do well here tomorrow,'' insisted Simon. But
polls have suggested he is running well behind Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   Simon has indicated he needs a good showing in Wisconsin in
order to continue his campaign. His only victory has come in his
home state of Illinois.
   Voters, Simon said, should send this message: `We're not going
to follow the pollsters; we're going to elect the man best
qualified to be president.''
   ``Al Gore agrees with that too,'' Simon added, referring to Sen.
Albert Gore. Jr of Tennesse. Polls indicate Gore, like Simon, is
lagging behind the two front-runners.
   ``There's no question the pollsters have shifted to a
Jackson-Dukakis race, partly because of what happened in
Michigan,'' Simon said.
   Jackson scored a 2-1 victory over Dukakis in Michigan on March
26.
   Simon shook hands with workers at Harley-Davison Co., the
nation's largest domestic producer of motorcycles. He noted
government revisions on import rules are credited with helping the
company improve its share of the American market in the face of
Japanese competition.
   The International Trade Commission's role in helping commerce
and employment could be strengthened, Simon said.
   ``We've had bankers and academicians and all sorts of people;
what we need is some labor representation on that commission,'' he
said.
   Simon was asked his opinion of Jackson's tactic of making
appearances in Kenosha, De Pere and other Wisconsin cities, in
sympathy with workers on strike or facing layoff.
   He said he does not want to criticize Jackson but said of his
rival's strategy: ``There is no question it is based in part on
rhetoric and not on programs.''

   A judge assigned Monday to the case against
a man accused of killing two women kept chained in a basement with
four other women promptly ordered attorneys to stop answering
reporters' questions.
   Common Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham was given the case of Gary
Heidnik and immediately met with Assistant District Attorney
Charles Gallagher and Heidnik's lawyer, A. Charles Peruto Jr.
   ``I've been gagged,'' Peruto said after the meeting.
   Heidnik is accused of capturing women he lured to his north
Philadelphia home, where police said he raped them, fed them dog
food and eventually killed two of them. Police said Sandra Lindsay
died of asphyxiation while hanging from a sewer pipe and Deborah
Dudley was electrocuted when touched by wires while she stood in a
water-filled basement pit.
   Testimony a a preliminary hearing alleged Heidnik used a power
saw to cut up Ms. Lindsay's body, stored parts in his kitchen
freezer and allegedly cooked pieces of the flesh.
   Pending before Abraham are Peruto's requests to have a jury
selected from outside Philadelphia, or to move the trial.
   Abraham said she has other cases pending and might be able to
hold hearings on the motions Friday or Monday.
   Peruto said before he met with the judge that he could see no
way his client could get a fair trial in Philadelphia.
   ``I don't think there is a Philadelphian around who doesn't know
about the case and wants him to'' die for the deaths, Peruto said.
``I'd like it tried in Nome, Alaska, or even further away.''
   ``Our defense will be insanity,'' he added.
   Gallagher is seeking the death penalty.
   Ms. Dudley's body was found by police in a wooded area in
southern New Jersey, after they were led there by a woman who
managed to escape from Heidnik's basement torture chamber.
   Heidnik financed his house of horrors by playing the stock
market, and accumulating more than $500,000 as the self-styled head
of a religious order he founded called United Church of the
Ministers of God. Peruto insists the financial success has no
bearing on whether his client is sane.
   Peruto claims that Heidnik's mental condition was aggravated
during Army service in the 1960s when he allegedly was the subject
of LSD hallucinogenic tests.
   ``I found that my client was a guinea pig for the U.S. Army and
it will be proven beyond any doubt,'' the lawyer said earlier.

<HEAD>Police Seize 58 Pounds of Heroin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they seized
more than 58 pounds of heroin in two separate operations and
arrested three people.
   Bernama, the national news agency, quoted superintendent Adnan
Baharum of the anti-drug office as saying 47 pounds were found in a
car and house in Kuala Lumpur on March 25.
   Superintendent Khalid Hashim in Butterworth, 180 miles northwest
of the capital, said 11 pounds were seized there on Sunday, hidden
in bushes.
   Neither official gave the source of the heroin, but most
narcotics captured in Malaysia come from Thailand.
   Police reported the Kuala Lumpur seizures followed the arrest of
a 36-year-old man in a car containing heroin. They said a
31-year-old man was arrested in the house where more drugs were
found and a third man was detained in a hotel.
   All three will be charged under anti-drug laws passed five years
ago that carry a mandatory death sentence on conviction, according
to officials.
   Butterworth police had received a tip about the heroin hidden
there and had the area under surveillance, but no one came to
collect it and there were no arrests, police said.
   Idris Ibrahim of the National Association for the Prevention of
Drug Abuse said Sunday that 62 drug traffickers have been executed
this year and 109 are on death row while their appeals are
considered.

   The dreams of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. have not been
realized and people should renew their commitment to his struggle,
supporters of the civil rights leader said Monday during nationwide
memorials on the 20th anniversary of his assassination.
   ``To ignore the past, even if it is painful, is to deny the
hopes and dreams that Martin Luther King lived for and died for,''
said the Rev. Robert Willingham, president of the Little Rock,
Ark., chapter of the NAACP. ``To look back is critical to our
efforts to move forward.''
   In King's hometown of Atlanta, his widow, Coretta Scott King,
led an hour-long observance at his tomb and announced plans for a
march in Washington Aug. 27, the anniversary of a civil rights
march there in which King delivered his famous ``I have a dream''
speech.
   This summer's march, she said, will concentrate on developing a
legislative agenda aimed at ending poverty, racism, war and
violence.
   ``We're going to Washington to mobilize a national coalition in
support of a legislative agenda that serves human needs,'' she
said. ``They have slain the dreamer, but we're here to say that
they cannot slay the mighty dream.''
   Also at the ceremony was King's sister, Christine King Farris.
She recalled that on the day he was shot, ``I thought on that day
how long life would be without Martin ... and here it is, 20 years
later, and we're still trying to perpetuate his legacy ... and his
dream.''
   King was shot by James Earl Ray on April 4, 1968, while standing
on the balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tenn. King was in
Memphis to lend support for striking sanitation workers who were
seeking increased wages.
   The Rev. James Lawson, president of the Los Angeles chapter of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was in Memphis the
day King was shot.
   ``As a local pastor, I led the sanitation strike that brought
Dr. King to Memphis,'' said Lawson. ``Dr. King had a very strong
sense that danger was imminent but he proceeded in the interest of
economic justice and human dignity.''
   About 600 people gathered in Lumberton, N.C., to pledge to
continue the struggle for change started by slain Lumbee Indian
leader Julian Pierce in Robeson County.
   ``We know from history that a bullet ... can never slay the
dream,'' he said. ``The dream of Julian Pierce is the dream of
Martin Luther King Jr. And that dream lives,'' said the Rev. Ben
Chavis.
   Pierce, shot to death at his home on March 26 in what
authorities said was a domestic dispute, was running for a Superior
Court judgeship. Many Lumbees and blacks in the county say they are
discriminated against, and that they are not represented adequately
in local political offices. The county's population is 37 percent
Indian, 37 percent white and 26 percent black.
   In Albany, N.Y., the Rev. Al Sharpton was arrested for refusing
to move out of a road outside the state Capitol. Three people were
arrested with Sharpton and 10 others, including folk singer Pete
Seeger, were detained after refusing to leave a service road.
   Their rally was called to protest state handling of the case of
Tawana Brawley, a black teen-ager who claims she was assaulted by a
group of white men. Sharpton had threatened to shut down state
agencies on the anniversary of King's death. Sharpton and others
among Miss Brawley's advisers have refused to let her cooperate
with the state investigation.
   About 200 people representing various religious groups prayed,
shouted and sang outside the Mobil Oil Corp. headquarters in
Manhattan in an anti-apartheid demonstration coinciding with the
King observances. The group urged Mobil to stop doing business in
South Africa.
   Religious leaders in Los Angeles planned an evening service
titled ``Twenty Years Later, We Still Have A Dream.''
   ``Although we have accomplished much, it is not enough to honor
him with memories,'' said Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive leader of
the SCLC in Los Angeles. ``We must renew our commitment to the
struggle for social change for which he so ardently fought.''
   Some civil rights leaders weren't pleased with the progress made
by blacks in American society.
   ``The cup is not half full. It contains only a few drops,'' said
Ronald Hunter, president of the Erie County, N.Y., chapter of the
SCLC. ``If Dr. King were alive today, he'd be very disillusioned.''
   ``Some things are worse than 20 years ago,'' he said. ``In
addition to high unemployment there are more school dropouts, high
drug and alcohol abuse, more teen-age pregnancy.''
   The civil rights movement is almost at a standstill, and many
young blacks lack the perspective of older civil rights workers,
said Daniel R. Acker, president of the Buffalo, N.Y., chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``They never knew the humiliation of Jim Crowism, of `colored
only' drinking fountains, and being forced to ride in the back of
the bus,'' Acker said.
   At least one observance was held overseas.
   About 400 people marched through the center of Rome in a
commemoration organized by Italy's tiny, maverick Radical Party.
   Some of the demonstrators carried banners with King's picture
and others carried multilingual posters calling for an end to
racial discrimination worldwide, a solution to the Palestinian
issue, and the drawing together of nations in a United States of
Europe.

<HEAD>UF Lab Uses New X-Ray Video Technique to Identify Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Florida lab says it is
using video equipment to identify the remains of crime victims in a
technique more sophisticated than that used in the case of Nazi
death-camp doctor Josef Mengele.
   Forensic anthropologist William R. Maples, who works at UF's
Florida State Museum, said Monday he superimposes on a video screen
X-rays of the victim's skull and photographs taken during his or
her lifetime.
   In one recent case, Maples said, the method allowed the
identification of a girl who had never had a medical or dental
X-ray taken in her life. Such X-rays often are used to identify a
victim with a high degree of certainty.
   By superimposing the girl's class picture and an X-ray of the
skull, Maples could precisely align the teeth, jaw bone and
openings for the eyes, ears and nose.
   ``Without this technique, the only evidence we have is the
general age, sex, race and height of the body, and that the
skeleton was found shortly after the girl disappeared,'' Maples
said. ``That's not very convincing.''
   The museum's C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory is the
only one in the country with such equipment, he said.
   Experts had questioned the identification of Nazi war criminal
Mengele in Brazil in 1985 because comparisons were made between
photographs of Mengele as a young man and those of an older man
presumed to be him. Dental evidence later established the skeletal
remains as Mengele's, Maples said.
   Photographs and skulls were manually superimposed in the
darkroom as early as the 1930s, but forensic experts often settled
for inexact results because of the dozens of tries required to
align the two images, he said.
   Video equipment has been used in the 1980s with little success
because most of the work was done by studio technicians not trained
in forensics, he said.
   Maples said the comparison of photos and X-rays on
high-resolution video equipment is an important tool.
   ``We can't rely on dental X-rays alone because there may be
none, people may have lost their teeth years after the X-rays were
taken or teeth may be destroyed in a fire, plane crash or other
disaster,'' he said.
   Maples said the technique confirmed his identifications in a
case in which a man and woman's skeletal remains were found in a
burned shack in High Springs.
   A suicide note in an abandoned car nearby linked the couple with
the slaying of the woman's parents in New Hampshire, and Maples
said he was able to confirm their identities by comparing teeth and
bone fragments from the fire with X-rays of the couple's teeth and
bones.
   The New Hampshire attorney general's office agreed with the
identification of the woman but isn't convinced in the case of the
man. Prosecutors there are keeping open murder warrants against the
man, citing the possibility he faked his suicide.

<HEAD>Iraq Asks U.N. Probe of Alleged Chemical Attacks by Iran</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said Monday it wants a U.N. team to
go to Baghdad to examine 88 soldiers it claims are victims of an
Iranian chemical attack.
   A U.N. spokesman said the request was under consideration.
   Last year a U.N. team visited Iraq and reported it found no
evidence that Iran had used chemical weapons. Its report left open
the possibility the Iraqi soldiers were accidentally injured while
handling their own chemical weapons.
   Other U.N. teams that visited Iran said they found evidence that
Iraq had used both mustard gas and nerve gas several times in the
Iran-Iraq war that began in September 1980.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz asked for a U.N. inspection
team in a letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who
sent investigators to Iran last month to investigate Iranian
charges against Iraq.
   Aziz said Iranian warplanes and artillery carried out chemical
attacks on Iraqi positions on March 30-31 near Halabjah in the
northern Kurdistan region.
   Iran has accused Iraq of using chemical weapons in the same
general area.
   Aziz said 88 Iraqi soldiers gassed in the attacks are now
hospitalized in Baghdad, the capital. ``The Iraqi government
requests your excellency to send a mission immediately to Iraq to
see the wounded and to get acquainted with the details of the
aggression,'' his letter said.
   Iran has denied using chemical weapons, which were
internationally outlawed after World War I. It has frequently told
the United Nations that Iraq is using the banned weapons.

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday rejected a
request that he free a gunman who took 84 people hostage in a
school at Tuscaloosa then surrendered after getting a purported
pardon from the governor.
   ``The public interest is not served by allowing someone to
profit by his own misconduct,'' U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer Jr.
said in dismissing a complaint by James Harvey's public defenders.
   Harvey put down his guns and surrendered after a 12-hour siege
Feb. 2 at West End Christian School, shortly after he was shown a
videotape of a phony pardon by Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Pointer said after a 60-minute hearing that Harvey had no legal
right to keep hostages or to refuse to surrender.
   The judge also said Hunt had no right to grant pardon or
immunity, since the state has a board for that purpose.
   One of Harvey's attorneys, Mike Cornwell, had argued that the
governor used means that ``cause dishonor to society.''
   He said the court should ``hold the governor to a higher level
of integrity than was shown that day.''
   Attorney General Don Siegelman told the court any agreement
between Hunt and Harvey was not binding and that enforcement of it
was not a constitutional right.
   ``Criminals have no legal right to negotiate by threatening the
lives of children,'' he said. ``The state, however, does have a
right to give false promises when necessary to protect the lives of
innocent children.''
   A Siegelman assistant, Susan Russ, said it was ``important to
vindicate the right of the governor to do what he did.''
   She also said that no pardon can be granted until a person is
convicted.
   Bargaining, she said, ``is nothing more than a law enforcement
tool. The governor could have used deadly force as a tool.''
   Hunt, Ms. Russ said, was the one being pressured because Harvey
was holding the children hostage.
   She said the ``contract'' by Hunt should not stand ``because it
was obtained under duress.''
   Ms. Russ also said Hunt had no option, that he was ``almost
forced to make this promise to avoid possible bloodshed.''
   Ms. Russ said Harvey still has all his rights to a fair trial.
   Albert Miles, an assistant to Cornwell, contended that Harvey
``had a fundamental right to trust the word of the government.''
   After Pointer's ruling, Cornwell gave notice that he plans to
appeal.

   President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, left their vacation ranch Monday and attended a luncheon
with financial supporters of a planned Reagan library.
   The reception and luncheon were given by supporters of the
Reagan Library Foundation at the estate of developer Gen. William
Lyon in Laguna Nigel, an Orange County community south of Los
Angeles.
   Some 75 supporters of the presidential library greeted the first
couple at Lyon's sprawling colonial mansion, set back hundreds of
yards from the road. Reagan, arriving by helicopter in a field
nearby, declined to answer questions from reporters, pointing at
his watch to suggest he did not have time to stop.
   The president also di not comment after the luncheon as he
boarded the helicopter for the return flight to his ranch near
Santa Barbara.
   The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library will be built in the Simi
Valley, northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County. Library
planners earlier were forced to abandon a site at Stanford
University in Palo Alto because of widespread protests there.
   Since then, the Los Angeles real estate firm of Blakeley-Swartz
donated a 100-acre site near the community of Simi Valley for the
library. But the site impinges on a greenbelt area that is
protected from large-scale development by a decade-old, non-binding
agreement among Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks.
   Mrs. Reagan was driven to the new site during a California
vacation last August, and approved it. The president gave his
approval after flying over the site, the library planners said.
   The Reagans, in the fourth day of a planned 10-day California
stay, did not venture from their 688-acre ranch near Santa Barbara
on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   A 25-pound lobster with claws the size of
baseball mitts that was saved from becoming an Easter dinner
arrived in Maine on Monday on the final leg of a roundabout journey
back to the sea.
   Maine marine officials gently placed ``Shirley,'' a male
estimated at 40 to 125 years, and a 19}-pound companion lobster
into a 600-gallon tub of icy saltwater after their flight from
Philadelphia. Freed from their ice-packed travel boxes, the
lobsters immediately began moving their giant claws around.
   ``Very good, he's moving around already. That's a good sign,''
Col. Robert Fogg, chief of the Bureau of Marine Patrol of the Maine
Department of Marine Resources, said of Shirley. ``A real weak
lobster would be very lifeless.
   ``They're excellent. I'm pleased with the way they've shown up.''
   Marine officials planned to return the crustacean behemoths to
the Atlantic early Tuesday off Cape Elizabeth if they remained
healthly overnight.
   ``This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens
are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' Fogg said.
``By protecting these large lobsters, there's more of a chance of
them reproducing'' and perpetuating the industry.
   Maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering lobsters larger than 4 to 5 pounds.
   If the lobsters' health deteriorated during the night and they
could not be saved, Lt. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Bureau of
Marine Patrol said the largest would be turned over to the Maine
State Museum.
   ``They're looking for a lobster to stuff,'' he said.
   Shirley and the companion lobster had been trucked to
Philadelphia from Long Island, N.Y., and sold for $287. After
crustacean rights advocates took up the cause, Kevin Hill, owner of
Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in the suburb of Ardmore, persuaded
the buyer to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead.
   Hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their
visit to Philadelphia's Main Line. He acknowledged that saving
lobsters from dinner palates was something new for him, ``which is
all right.''
   He also said that the lobsters had been good business, as
thousands of peole dropped by for a look at Shirley.
   ``It's been very good for business. If they don't buy now, at
least they know where we are,'' said Hill, who planned to travel to
Maine to be on hand for the lobsters' release into the Atlantic.
   Hill delayed packing the lobsters for their trip until the last
possible minute. ``Believe it or not, I'm still getting people
coming by the window to look at 'em,'' he said Monday.
   Pity Not Cruelty Inc., a small animal rights group, made
arrangements with Maine officials to turn the creatures loose and
assumed the $40 flight cost.
   If it seems to be a lot of fuss over a couple of lobsters, group
vice president Gloria Felscher-Cohen makes no apologies.
   ``Why not? These two lobsters have survived hazards,
particularly Shirley, over 100 years,'' she said. ``Why should she
need to succumb to the cruelest predator of all, man?''

<HEAD>Wedtech Witness: We Tried to Sell to Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Wedtech Corp. executive testified
Monday that the scandal-plagued defense contractor tried
unsuccessfully to sell military equipment to Iran, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia.
   The negotiations to sell bridge pontoons and other supplies
eventually fell through with all three nations, said former Wedtech
Vice Chairman Mario Moreno.
   Moreno, in his 14th day of testimony at the racketeering trial
of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others, was questioned by
defense attorneys about Wedtech's Middle East dealings.
   The jury was not present during questioning on that topic and
U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley later ruled it
inadmissible.
   The judge said the testimony would unduly prejudice the jury
because there was no evidence a crime had been committed.
   In other testimony, the defense tried to throw some doubt on
Moreno's previous testimony that Biaggi had demanded 5 percent of
Wedtech's stock in return for his law firm's assistance in
obtaining no-bid government contracts.
   They pointed out that in a February 1987 interview with federal
prosecutors, Moreno said another Wedtech official wanted to give
the stock to the Biaggi and Ehrlich law firm in exchange for unpaid
legal services.
   Biaggi, his former law partner Bernard Ehrlich and five others
are charged with turning Wedtech, a now-bankrupt, Bronx defense
contractor, into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions
of dollars in bribes.
   Wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a multi-million
dollar manufacturer through a federal program that set aside
contracts without competitive bidding for companies controlled by
minority group members.
   Prosecutors claim Biaggi and others helped Wedtech falsely
portray itself as a minority concern eligible for the no-bid
program.
   Defense attorney Dominic Amorosa asked Moreno if Wedtech had
acted on behalf of the U.S. government in the Middle East.
   ``No, we were acting as Wedtech,'' said Moreno, one of four
ex-Wedtech executives to plead guilty to state and federal
corruption charges.
   The witness said Wedtech sought to sell military equipment to
Iran in 1982-1983 and to Iraq in 1984-1985, adding, ``We believed
we could do it legally.''
   ``You knew you could never legally have gotten an export license
(to sell military equipment)?'' asked Amorosa.
   ``It crossed my mind,'' said Moreno.
   Asked if E. Robert Wallach, a close friend of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, had said he could help obtain export licenses,
Moreno replied: ``It never got to that point.''
   Moreno previously testified that Wedtech paid Wallach $800,000
for his ``influence with Ed Meese'' although no wrongdoing by Meese
has been established.
   Moreno also said a former Meese financial adviser, W. Franklyn
Chinn, was helping with Wedtech negotiations with the Iraqis.
   ``Chinn was a conduit in trying to sell arms to Iraq,'' said
Moreno.
   ``I've never heard this allegation before, and I continue to
deny that Frank Chinn has engaged in any illegal conduct,'' said
Cristina Arguedas, Chinn's lawyer, when called at her Berkeley,
Calif., office.
   Both Wallach and Chinn are under indictment with a third man,
Chinn business associate R. Kent London, accused of extracting
payoffs from Wedtech for allegedly influencing Meese and other
officials.

   Prosecutors subpoenaed 90 witnesses and
planned to present a chain of circumstantial evidence as testimony
began Monday in the trial of an airline pilot charged with killing
his wife and running her body through a rented wood chipper.
   Prosecutors say they can connect Richard B. Crafts, 50, of
Newtown, with the murder of his 39-year-old wife, Helle, a flight
attendant.
   Crafts, an Eastern Airlines pilot, is accused of killing his
Danish-born wife in November 1986, shortly after she told him she
planned to get a divorce. She was last seen on Nov. 18, 1986, when
friends drove her home following a flight from West Germany.
   The prosecution, which doesn't plan to say how Crafts killed his
wife, said it will present medical evidence that includes body
fragments found near a lake close to the couple's home.
   The defense contends that the state doesn't have enough proof
that the mother of three young children is even dead. The
prosecution says Crafts ran her body parts through the wood chipper
to cover up the crime.
   The case was moved from Danbury, the western Connecticut
jurisdiction where the crime allegedly occurred, to this coastal
city because a judge decided that pretrial publicity would
prevented him from seating an impartial jury.
   Crafts, also a former part-time police officer in Newtown and
Southbury, has been held in lieu of $750,000 bail since his arrest
nearly 15 months ago.
   Before testimony began Monday, Judge Barry Schaller ruled that
the prosecution cannot use as evidence wood chips and a clump of
tissue-like material with human blood seized from Crafts' car.
   However, Schaller said he will permit evidence taken from the
Crafts' home, including 51 firearms, carpet samples and a pair of
men's shoes.
   State's Attorney Walter Flanagan, who had characterized evidence
taken from the car and home as crucial, said after the judge's
ruling, ``It was obviously a significant piece of evidence.''
Defense attorney J. Daniel Sagarin had argued that investigators
improperly seized the evidence.
   A private investigator hired by Mrs. Crafts, a stewardess for
Pan American World Airways, to obtain evidence about her husband's
alleged infidelity filed a missing person's report on Dec. 1, 1986.
   An attorney who was handling Mrs. Crafts' divorce case testified
during pretrial hearings that she told him he should be suspicious
if anything happened to her.
   In court Monday, Mrs. Crafts' mother, Elisabeth Neilsen of
Denmark, testifying through an interpreter, turned over a series of
letters she had received from her daughter in 1986.
   In the letters, read outside the presence of the jury, Mrs.
Crafts said she had told her husband she wanted a divorce and that
he was ``seemingly not happy about the idea.'' She also said she no
longer trusted him.
   Schaller said the parts of the letters in which Mrs. Crafts
described her husband's reactions wouldn't be allowed as evidence.
   The state medical examiner's office issued a death certificate
on Feb. 6, 1987, listing the cause of Mrs. Crafts' death as
unknown. The certificate was based on an examination of body parts,
including a piece of a tooth and a piece of a finger, found by
police.

   Here is a list of the seven U.S. governors who have been
impeached and removed from office, including Evan Mecham of Arizona
who was convicted Monday:
   
   WILLIAM W. HOLDEN of North Carolina, removed in 1871.
   Holden was impeached after he unconstitutionally suspended the
right of habeas corpus and sent militia to quell violence by the Ku
Klux Klan, which was accused of murders aimed at frightening blacks
into not voting. He also arrested a number of political opponents.
   
   DAVID BUTLER, Nebraska's first governor, removed in 1871.
   Butler was removed for misappropriating school funds, but the
impeachment proceedings subsequently were expunged from the
legislative record and in 1888 he was elected to another term as
governor.
   
   WILLIAM SULZER, New York, removed in 1913.
   The Senate convicted him of three charges of misappropriation of
funds. Sulzer, a product of Tammany Hall, snubbed the machine's
patronage demands after he was elected and launched an
investigation of corruption. Annoyed legislators then dredged up
charges of financial irregularities, which even some anti-Tammany
forces agreed were true.
   
   JAMES E. ``Farmer Jim'' FERGUSON, Texas, 1917.
   Ferguson was convicted by the Senate on 10 charges, some
stemming from a fight over control of the University of Texas.
Ferguson resigned a day before his conviction was announced.
   His wife, Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson, was twice elected governor,
serving from 1925-27 and 1933-35.
   
   JOHN C. WALTON, Oklahoma, removed in 1923.
   He had declared martial law and ordered the National Guard to
disband a grand jury which was investigating him. The House
returned 22 articles of impeachment ranging from violation of the
separation of powers to diverting public funds.
   
   HENRY S. JOHNSTON, Oklahoma, removed in 1929.
   Johnston had ordered the National Guard to surround the Capitol
to prevent the Legislature from assembling to investigate the
governor. Johnston was impeached but not convicted in 1928, but was
impeached again the next year and removed.
   
   EVAN MECHAM, Arizona, removed in 1988.
   Mecham was convicted of attempting to thwart an investigation
into a death threat allegedly made by an aide in fall 1987. The
vote in the state Senate was 21-9, one more vote than the
two-thirds needed. Though it was not needed to remove him from
office, a second Senate vote then convicted him on an unrelated
count. The first-term Republican took office in January 1987.

   A judge bowed to objections from news
organizations and lifted an order barring reporting on jury
selection Monday at the cocaine-sale trial of John Zaccaro Jr., son
of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   The 24-year-old Zaccaro is charged with selling a quarter gram
of the drug to an undercover officer two years ago while a senior
at Middlebury College. The offense carries a penalty of up to five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Zaccaro on Monday entered the courtroom separately from his
parents, Ferraro and John Zaccaro Sr., as the long-delayed trial
began. But they sat immediately behind their son.
   In questioning of at least seven potential jurors Monday, none
said Ferraro's candidacy would have any affect on how they would
judge her son.
   Several panelists expressed strong sentiments about drugs. One
juror, who was dismissed, said, ``I'd probably be the one going to
jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   Judge Francis McCaffrey, after a meeting with attorneys, had
imposed an gag order and said only six reporters could attend jury
selection. He said that he expects the process to last three days
and that any information published could prejudice the jury pool.
   ``It is important that we get an impartial jury. That is where
you persons have become an issue,'' McCaffrey told the 11 reporters
in the courtroom. ``Clearly, segregated voir dire is appropriate in
this case.''
   However, after an afternoon hearing on a challenge from several
news organizations, McCaffery lifted the order. But he said only
six reporters would be allowed in the room during the proceedings
and they would have to share their information.
   Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including The Associated Press, had told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   ``The issue, then, is, what is happening in the voir dire
process that is different or more damaging (than previous pre-trial
publicity)?'' Hemley said.
   Zaccaro's lawyers, Charles Tetzlaff and Thomas Sherrer, had
requested the order and Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn
did not object. Quinn said he also was concerned about the jury
pool, noting that the case has received widespread publicity
because of Ferraro's prominence.
   Zaccaro is charged with sale of a regulated drug for allegedly
selling cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to
his off-campus apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   Zaccaro also had been charged with possession of cocaine with
intent to sell, based on evidence police had found in Zaccaro's
car, including eight grams of cocaine and documents described as
records of drug transactions.
   But the charge was dismissed because of problems with the search
warrant and the lack of other evidence to prove the charge.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his famous mother, who ran on the Democratic ticket in
1984 with Walter Mondale.
   Tetzlaff and Sherrer were unsuccessful in having the case thrown
out altogether. The Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the
charges.

   Here is the text of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noreiga's letter to Jesse Jackson, as released Monday by the
Jackson campaign. It was written in response to a March 23 letter
from Jackson. The text, as released by the campaign, contained
several fragmentary sentences, misspellings, and other
irregularities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dear Reverend Jackson:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With sincere emotion, I read your most attentive letter,
addressed to me, dated March 23, delivered by Cirilo McSween, in
which you expressed your moral concern for the political and
economic living conditions of the Panamanian people. Your concern
for the crisis which has provoked great suffering and your appeal
to me to persist in seeking peace and to put an end to this crisis,
you expressed your anxiety to do whatever is possible to help
alleviate the suffering and that we should act immediately.
   Your reputation as a great moral authority obligates me to give
consideration and pay attention to your appeal, so that we may work
together for the peace and unification of my country. In this
sense, I manifest that it has always been one of the objectives of
the Defense Force and mine, to try to keep social peace for the
Panamanian brothers and sisters and the foreigners that reside in
our country. Our doctrine of National Security is inspired in the
ideals of social justice and not of military concepts.
   I am sure that you are aware of the deep internal and external
aspects of the political and economic situation now they have been
destabalizing our consitutional Panamanian institutions so as to
have a country that is weak and ruined, so it becomes an easy prey
for the dictates of foreign forces. I am sure that you know the
details of the amalgam between professional Panamanian politicians
that are now dressed in sheepskin, and the legislative and
executive sectors of the United States of America, who have
translated an open and barefaced intervention into the internal
affairs of Panama, with the final proposition that they do not give
compliment to the covenant of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty of 1977.
No Panamanian with a firm nationalistic and patriotic sentiment
would ever accept that the solution of internal problems of the
Republic of Panama, be dictated from Washington, D.C.
(Consequently, I find it unnecesary to repeat this answer to your
letter with more details in the wheel of the Panamanian crisis.
   There is something that has awakened my curiosity and come to my
attention: How is it possible that the Reagan's Administration who
has publicly made gala of great love for God and have profound
religious sentiment has campaigned terrible economic sanctions that
have been imposed on the Panamanian people, causing the kind of
suffering that you feel sincerely inhuman, causing the threat of
brutal military forces, the sabotage, the psychological war against
a materially small and weak country, but a dignified coungry, just
like Panama is.
   Manuel Solis Palma is the actual Head of State of Panama by
Constitutional decision of the Legislative Assembly; it is
recognized by the Supreme Court of Justice. He has recently called
for a sincere national dialogue between all the sectors of the
Panamanian society, with the purpose of a specific solution for the
Democracy of our country, with up-coming celebration of free and
open elections of May 1989.
   The Defense Forces support this cause by the Panamanian Chief of
State and at the same time, reject any imposition and any political
and economic program that will be dictated from Washington, D.C.
   The word, ``perpetuity'' has been historically imposed on Panama
by the Unied States of America in the different Canal Treaties
since 1903. Nevertheless, I assure you that, those words do not
form a part of my personal vocabulary, nor of my honor in the
military. My duration as Commander and Chief of the Defense Forces
is governed by the Panamanian Constitution and Law of the Defense
Forces.
   You can do a lot to help, by eliminating one of the principal
causes of the suffering of many Panamanians. In other words, the
foreign intervention. You may contribute by your knowledgeable
advice and create by mutual communition, the harmony and the
material peace between all Panamanians, without discrimination of
any class.
   With my deepest respect for you, I shall be at your disposition
to speak with you more deeply about this theme whenever you are
available.
   Attentively,
   
   P.S. I have been lied about! I have been villafied! I have been
humiliated internationally!
   I consider myself to have been persecuted by illegal actions by
so-called justice, by political interests of your nation.
   I, as a Christian, before you, denounce this untrue, because how
is it possible that nation as powerful should employ the services
of journalistic mis-information, the threat of death bdfore one of
God's children, such as I consider to be at the present time in
this struggle?
   This is my testimony, Reverend Jackson, before the Divine and
Eternal Laws of the all-powerful God.
   I feel rich in faith and find my situation in Isaiah 45, with
all humility and reverence.

   The Reagan administration on Monday scuttled
Attorney General Edwin Meese III's plans to designate a Justice
Department deputy as the new head of the criminal division, sources
said, and Meese's choice for the department's No. 2 post said he
may not take the job.
   The two men were to have filled posts being vacated because of
the resignations of two of Meese's top aides.
   Arlin Adams, the Philadelphia lawyer who had been the attorney
general's choice to fill the Justice Department's No. 2 post, says
he told Meese on Monday that he is ``not optimistic'' that he will
be able to take the job.
   In an interview, Adams said that his colleagues at his law firm
``take a very dim view of my leaving at this time'' because he is
handling an extensive caseload in Philadelphia, including a major
antitrust case, and ``I don't want to leave the firm in the lurch.''
   Adams, who would be succeeding Deputy Attorney General Arnold
Burns, pointed out that he resumed private practice just last year
after stepping down from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``I've not made a decision (on whether to accept the Justice
Department post), but I'm not optimistic and I told the attorney
general that today,'' said Adams.
   Meanwhile, a Justice Department source speaking on condition of
anonymity said that James I.K. Knapp, 45, a deputy assistant
attorney general in the department's tax division, is being removed
from consideration to fill the post formerly held by Assistant
Attorney General William Weld.
   The White House on Friday held up Meese's plans to announce the
replacements for Weld and at least one other aide, pending
completion of background checks.
   Department sources declined to say why Knapp's name was being
removed from consideration, and a reporter's telephone messages
left at Knapp's home were not immediately returned.
   A Justice Department news release had been prepared last week
containing Knapp's name as Meese's choice for the post, said the
sources.
   Burns and Weld resigned out of concern that the 11-month-old
criminal investigation of Meese was hurting the Justice
Department's operations and image.
   Asked whether he had any qualms about serving under Meese, Adams
said that ``I look at the job as serving the United States
government and the Department of Justice; I really don't know the
background'' of the allegations concerning Meese.
   Of the investigation of Meese, he said that ``It would be much
better if that did not exist, but that is not dominating my
decision.''
   He said that when Justice Department officials ``called me down
(to Washington on Thursday), almost right away I told them that I
was honored to be asked.''
   Meese had been prepared on Friday to announce the replacement
for Weld and at least one other top Justice Department vacancy, the
post held by Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott, who is
leaving to become a federal appeals court judge.
   Francis A. Keating II, assistant Treasury secretary for
enforcement, is to take the No. 3 department job being vacated by
Trott, Justice Department sources said late last week.
   Earlier Monday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
``We have received some names. We are processing the normal FBI
clearances, but there's nothing out of the routine.'' Fitzwater
made the comments in Santa Barbara, Calif., as President Reagan
vacationed at his nearby ranch.
   Meese, who is the subject of criminal investigations, is trying
to rebuild the top echelon of the Justice Department in the wake of
the resignations of Burns and Weld.
   Asked Monday if there had been any high-level White House
discussions of the political ramifications of Meese's legal
problems, Fitzwater said, ``No.''
   He also said ``I don't know of any plans'' for Reagan to discuss
the subject directly with Meese, his longtime friend and aide.
   Of the choices to succeed Burns and Weld, who resigned last
Tuesday, Fitzwater said: ``There are some names that have been
floating around in the press, but at this point we have not
received formal nominations.''
   The candidates to succeed Burns, Weld and Trott will ``go
through the White House and the president will announce his
intention to nominate,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meese is leaving the country Wednesday for a week-long trip to
South America to speak to officials there on drug-related matters.
   Independent counsel James McKay, who has been conducting a
criminal investigation of Meese since last May 11, said Friday he
did not plan to seek an indictment of Meese, ``based on the
evidence developed to date.''
   This news heartened Reagan, according to White House officials,
who noted that the president has steadfastly supported his
embattled attorney general.
   But two White House officials were quoted in the Los Angeles
Times Monday as saying they thought Meese should step down.
   These officials, who were not named by The Times, said the
attorney general had become a political liability for Reagan and
for the Republican Party.
   They said they were discussing the Meese situation despite
orders by White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. to
maintain silence on the matter.

   When Evan Mecham became governor of
Arizona in January 1987 he was on top of the world: a millionaire
auto dealer who finally had become king of the political hill on
his fifth try.
   Fifteen months later the first-term Republican's career is in
ruins after he was impeached and ousted from office.
   His term was marked by a firestorm of controversy that began
even before he took office.
   He was criticized for cancelling a holiday for state workers in
honor of slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., making
racially insensitive remarks and alienating blacks, homosexuals and
feminists.
   He did not begin to fall, however, until he was accused of
failing to list $350,000 in campaign contributions. Then he was
accused of trying to thwart an investigation of a death threat
against a witness in the campaign fund probe.
   He was also accused of lending $80,000 in state money to his own
auto dealership, Mecham Pontiac.
   Those accusations became the basis of the impeachment charges
that resulted in his removal from office Monday; he also faces a
criminal trial in April.
   Mecham, 63, son of Mormon farming parents in Utah and a World
War II fighter pilot, was an extreme conservative and perennial
political outsider who tried and tried again, eventually running
for governor five times.
   He finally took office in 1986 over opposition from the state
Republican establishment, the media and many Phoenix business
leaders.
   Being a dairy farmer's son during the Depression and early war
years forged Mecham's character, including those traits responsible
for both his rise and his fall.
   ``He's never been a quitter,'' said his cousin, Ona Rust, in an
interview in Altamont, Utah, earlier this year.
   In 1942, 18-year-old Evan took over most duties on his father's
farm when his father became incapacitated by arthritis. Evan was
forced to cut back on schoolwork, but kept up his grades and earned
a scholarship to Utah State University.
   He had a reputation as someone who always worked hard, said
another former neighbor, Harry Fieldsted, who added, ``I don't know
if he was any smarter, but he seemed to apply himself more.''
   Mecham sang and danced at Mormon Church functions and was
elected student body president his junior year at Altamont High
School, though he was kidded about his shyness in the 1941 yearbook.
   Mecham's date at the Altamont junior prom, Florence Lambert,
became his wife, and they ended up having seven children. The
couple settled in Arizona after World War II and Mecham started to
study business at Arizona State University.
   He put himself through college by selling cars in rural Ajo; in
1950, he moved his Pontiac dealership to Glendale, a Phoenix
suburb. He published his own newspaper during the 1960s to provide
an alternative to the Phoenix press.
   Mecham became interested in politics during the 1950s and won
his only previous term in office _ as a state senator _ in 1960.
Two years later he lost a U.S. Senate race, then ran unsuccessfully
for governor four times, including a 1978 loss to Democrat Bruce
Babbitt by about 41,000 votes.
   Mecham wasn't planning to run for governor in 1986 until
confidante Max Hawkins launched a one-man draft. He won the office
with only 40 percent of the vote in a three-way race.
   Mecham ran into his first controversy the day after the election
when he announced he would cancel the King holiday on grounds
Babbitt illegally created it by executive order.
   By the time Mecham was inaugurated on Jan. 5, 1987, Ed Buck and
a few other members of the Mecham Watchdog Committee were marching
in the background and announced plans to recall him from office.
   By the time the renamed Mecham Recall Committee kicked off its
campaign on July 5, Mecham had:
   _Made good on his promise to cancel the King holiday.
   _Defended the use of the word ``pickaninny'' to describe black
children in an essay in a book by his mentor, Utah
``constitutionalist'' W. Cleon Skousen.
   _Made what some considered a string of substandard nominations,
including a proposed liquor department head who was under
investigation in a 1955 slaying and a revenue department head who
had filed his own income taxes late.
   _Claimed that working women cause divorce and that homosexuality
is an unacceptable lifestyle.
   The controversy escalated in late September when Mecham's
backers mailed a nationwide fund-raising letter urging conservative
Republicans to ``sell your house, pack your belongings'' and move
to Arizona to help him battle the ``militant liberals and the
homosexual lobby.''
   The letter led to the first public calls for his resignation,
including one from Arizona GOP patriarch Barry Goldwater.
   Then Garry Trudeau's nationally syndicated comic strip
``Doonesbury'' portrayed him as saying that charges against him
were lies ''spread by queers and pickaninnies!''
   Mecham constantly warred with the media, claiming reporters felt
no obligation to tell the truth and accusing the news media of
spreading the ``cancerous lie'' that he was a bigot.
   Mecham's legal problems surfaced in October, when it was
revealed that he had failed to list a $350,000 campaign loan in his
financial reports. Attorney General Bob Corbin and House Speaker
Joe Lane launched investigations as the governor claimed the
failure was an ``honest mistake'' and that the loan was lumped with
others to save time.
   Then, a few days before the state grand jury was to open its
probe of the loan, a state official told the Department of Public
Safety that another state official, Lee Watkins, had threatened the
life of grand jury witness and former Mecham legislative aide Donna
Carlson if she didn't keep her mouth shut about the loan.
   When DPS Director Ralph Milstead told Mecham his office was
going to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation of the
alleged threat, the governor allegedly ordered him not to do so.
   It also was revealed in late fall that Mecham had loaned his
auto dealership $80,000 from a protocol fund created from money
raised by his inaugural committee.
   Mecham Pontiac, which bore the sign, ``If you can't deal with
Mecham, you just can't deal,'' had to be sold last week due to poor
sales blamed on an ``avalanche of negative publicity.''
   Only the $350,000 campaign loan was cited when Mecham was
indicted by the state grand jury on Jan. 8, but the House impeached
him on all three charges.
   Mecham still faces an April 21 criminal trial on the $350,000
loan charge. The Senate dismissed that impeachment article in an
effort to guarantee him a fair trial and ensure an early
impeachment vote.
   Through it all Mecham steadfastly refused to resign and insisted
he would be found innocent in both courts and would be re-elected
in the May recall election.
   The governor often quoted Abraham Lincoln, saying he would be
happy if he eventually were vindicated but if he weren't, ``Ten
angels swearing I was right won't make any difference.''

   A judge and a witness were given
police protection Monday after a vengeful cop killer described as
``educated and cold-blooded'' broke out of a maximum security
prison along with two other murderers.
   Bobby Stacy, 35, and two other inmates serving life sentences
without chance of parole escaped from the West Virginia
Penitentiary here on Sunday.
   ``My fear is that some police officer is going to get killed,
because that's this guy's method. He has nothing to lose, plus it's
his history,'' said Charles Hatcher, the assistant Cabell County
prosecutor whom Stacy had threatened.
   Stacy, formerly of Columbus, Ohio, was convicted in the 1981
murder of a Huntington police officer. At the time of the slaying,
he was free on bail on charges that he shot an Ohio patrolman.
   Police immediately assigned protection to some of those who
helped convict Stacy. Stacy repeatedly threatened to kill the judge
and the prosecutor at the 1982 trial, according to Huntington
police Lt. Joe Walker.
   ``He is educated and cold blooded. That's the worst combination
there is,'' Hatcher said in Huntington, 160 miles south of the
prison. He said he had no plans to ask for protection for himself.
   Stacy was a successful businessman who used the money from his
crimes for business ventures. When he was arrested, he owned a bar,
at least two houses and several automobiles.
   Roadblocks were set up on routes leading into Ohio and
Pennsylvania, which borders Marshall County, where the prison is,
to the east.
   State police in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as
sheriff's deputies, combed the countryside, said warden's secretary
Jerrie Clutter.
   Circuit Judge Alfred E. Ferguson, who asked that an extra
sheriff's bailiff be assigned to him, said he was concerned about
his safety. ``I'll be more worried if he is out for awhile,''
Ferguson said in Huntington.
   Also under protection was an unidentified Columbus, Ohio, woman
and former friend of Stacy's who had testified against him, said
Columbus police Officer Clarence Ward.
   ``If anyone has to fear, she does,'' Hatcher said. Her car was
torched and she received death threats during the trial, he said.
   Hatcher said he was offered police protection but turned it down.
   ``Let's face it, if somebody wants to kill you, they're not
going to announce it and swing into town,'' he said. ``They're
going to do it at a red light, or through your kitchen window.''
   Huntington police officers, who usually patrol alone, worked in
pairs Monday.
   ``A suspect is less likely to shoot that way,'' said Lt. Toby
Shy.
   Stacy, David Williams, 28, and Tommie Mollohan, 45, were
discovered missing during a routine check Sunday night, officials
said.
   Warden Jerry Hedrick said Monday the inmates, all maintenance
workers, knocked a hole in a wall of an elevator shaft in the
infirmary to gain entrance to a shed where bolt cutters were kept.
   Then they climbed through another elevator shaft, this one in an
unused building, to the second floor, where they used pipe and a
cord to lower themselves to the ground, he said.
   The escapees hid behind ventilation equipment, then used the
bolt cutters to cut through a lock on a gate and flee, he said.
   Hedrick said evidence indicated the escapees had outside help.
He said bloodhounds tracked their scent across the street to a
museum parking lot, where the trail disappeared.
   ``It obviously was well-planned. Therefore we have got to assume
plans were also made for the outside once they got out,'' said
Corrections Commissioner A.V. Dodrill.
   Mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a Brounland
grocer in 1973. Mollohan at the time was an escapee from a Florida
prison.
   Williams was convicted of murder, arson and robbery in the 1980
slaying of a Marytown resident found bludgeoned in his burned home.

   A federal appeals court refused Monday to
reverse the espionage and theft convictions of a former U.S.
intelligence analyst who gave secret satellite photographs of a
Soviet ship to a British magazine.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously rejected Samuel Loring Morison's arguments that
Congress intended laws against spying to protect against the
distribution of classified material to a foreign government rather
than leaks to the press.
   Several news organizations _ including The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and three television
networks _ filed briefs in the appeal, which focused on First
Amendment guarantees of free speech and freedom of the press.
   Morison, grandson of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning naval
historian Samuel Eliot Morison, was convicted in October 1985 of
giving to Jane's Defence Weekly photographs taken by a U.S. spy
satellite of a Soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under construction.
   Morison, who worked as a civilian for the Navy, also was
convicted of the theft of the photos and government documents
describing a May 1984 explosion at the Soviet Union's Severomorsk
naval base.
   He was sentenced to two years in prison but has been free under
$100,000 bond pending the appeal.
   Prosecutors said Morison's actions endangered national security
because the photos revealed how a U.S. spy satellite worked. They
also said he leaked the photos to get a full-time job with Jane's
after doing part-time work for the military journal while employed
by the Navy.
   The American Civil Liberties Union denounced the appeals court
decision.
   ``The decision poses a grave threat to the First Amendment,''
said Kate Martin, speaking for the civil liberties group in
Washington, D.C. ``It will signficantly cut off public debate on
issues of national security. If the decision stands, it may
criminalize much of what is printed daily in newspapers on national
security matters.''
   Defense attorneys contended Morison was trying to educate the
public about a Soviet naval buildup and that the photos told the
Soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 1978 incident
in which the spy satellite's operations manual was sold to a Soviet
agent.
   The defense also said the espionage prosecution violated
Morison's right to free speech and would intimidate low-level
government employees from leaking information which would embarrass
their superiors.
   ``The mere fact that one has stolen a document in order that he
may deliver it to the press, whether for money or other personal
gain, will not immunize him from responsibility for his criminal
act,'' said Judge Donald Russell in the main ruling.
   ``To use the First Amendment for such a purpose would be to
convert the First Amendment into a warrant for thievery.''
   In a concurring opinion, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III said the
constitutional interests were significant, but added that the
manner in which the photographs were released threatened another
important public interest, the security of sensitive government
operations.
   Judge J. Dickson Phillips Jr., in his concurring opinion, agreed
that broadly drawn federal espionage laws ``are unwieldy and
imprecise instruments for prosecuting government `leakers' to the
press as opposed to government `moles' in the service of other
countries.''
   Yet in Morison's case, he said, a jury instruction requiring
proof that the leaked information was either potentially damaging
to the government or might be useful to an enemy was a sufficient
limit.
   Mark Lynch, Morison's lawyer, had not seen the appeals ruling
Monday. He said he had not decided whether to seek a rehearing
before the 4th Circuit or ask for a U.S. Supreme Court review of
the case.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson made final appeals
to Wisconsin Democrats Monday on the eve of the state's
presidential primary, saying, ``I've stood with you, and now I want
you the people to stand with me.''
   Jackson campaigned before college students, held rallies in
predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods of Milwaukee, and
addressed 4,000 people on the stops of the state Capitol in Madison.
   Thousands filled Milwaukee's Mecca Auditorium for an evening
rally. In Madison, a huge crowd filled the Capitol steps, rising
high on a hill, and spilled over to sidewalks across the street as
Jackson delivered an emotional appeal for support under the setting
sun.
   ``You're looking for a leader to vote for in Wisconsin,'' he
said.
   Earlier, Jackson campaigned among college students on the 20th
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, repeatedly invoking
the memory of the slain civil rights leader.
   ``Twenty years later, we've kept struggling,'' he said.
``Nothing will break our spirit. Reagan says cut back; we say fight
back.''
   Jackson said his goal, like King's, was ``pulling people
together across ancient barriers to common ground.''
   Urging the students to reject ``yuppie-ism,'' Jackson told them
that by voting, ``you have the power to end Reaganomics.''
   Jackson walked through a Hispanic community of Milwaukee, where
he drew only a small crowd, and later spoke to hundreds of students
at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus.
   He also spoke to a largely black street rally and headed to
later rallies in Janesville and at the state Capitol in Madison.
   Jackson was counting on broad support, beyond Wisconsin's small
minority population, he if is to win the primary, where 81
delegates are at stake.
   A recent Milwaukee Journal poll put him 8 percentage points
behind Michael Dukakis, but the race was still regarded as close.
   As he campaigned, Jackson was embroiled in controversy over his
appeal to Panama strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to leave
office and a message he sent two weeks ago saying, ``I am anxious
to do whatever I can to help alleviate the suffering.''
   Jackson released a translated letter of response from Noriega,
saying he was not leaving and offering ``to speak with you more
deeply ... whenever you are available.''
   Jackson said he had no plans to visit Noriega. He repeated his
call for Noriega to leave, asked for a congressional investigation
into U.S. dealings with the accused drug smuggler, and called for
international relief agencies to provide ``humanitarian'' aid to
the people of Panama.
   At the State Department, deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
signalled displeasure over Jackson's communications with Noriega.
   ``In our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that Noriega
likes to use to buy time,'' Ms. Oakley said. ``We have available
channels of communication with Noriega if and when they are needed.
We think it would be best to continue to use these channels
exclusively.''
   Jackson, however, said he was not attempting to interfere.
   ``It's nothing but a very strong and public appeal,'' he said.
``... The appeal has been very public ... I would hope the whole
world would make a public appeal.''
   Jackson said he did not favor an end to the economic sanctions
applied to pressure Noriega to leave office. But he said they have
caused some people to lack food and medicine, and have not achieved
their goal.
   ``The quick solution of economic sanctions clearly did not
work,'' Jackson said. ``... Now we are in danger of alienating''
the people of Panama. He also attacked what he called a ``policy of
hysteria and military adventurism'' by the Reagan administration in
the region.
   Jackson said he talked by telephone Monday afternoon with two
high-ranking State Department officials and said they offered no
disagreement with his appeal for Noriega to leave.
   Speaking with reporters on his campaign bus in Janesville, Wis.,
Jackson said John C. Whitehead, the deputy secretary of state, and
Michael H. Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
told him the Reagan administration already has begun providing a
small amount of humanitarian aid because of hardships in Panama
caused by the economic sanctions. He said it amounted to $275,000.
   ``But that is too little, as compared to the serverity of the
crunch on the people,'' Jackson told reporters.
   Jackson said he called the State Department during a stop for a
campaign rally in Janesville. He said Whitehead ``saw abosultely
nothing inconsistent with our very public and moral appeal to get
Noriega to leave.''
   He said the officials made no suggestion that he should tone
down his efforts or be more cautious with dealing with Noriega.
   On another matter, Jackson aides distributed what they said was
an apology Jackson received from Jeanne Simon, wife of rival Paul
Simon. It was in reaction to her saying of Jackson: ``All he can do
is talk. Adolf Hitler made some good speeches too.''
   In her statement to Jackson, she called him a powerful orator.
``Experience is also important in a president and that's the point
I was addressing. I used the most extreme example I could have to
make that point, and I should not have. I appologize to Jesse if
there was any misunderstanding,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, the Jackson campaign _ once strapped for funds _
collected $2.2 million last month. That provides him with some
ready cash for use in big contests like the April 19 New York
primary.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors may use evidence seized at
the home of a man accused in 16 slayings at his trial for the
shooting deaths of two of the victims, a judge ruled Monday.
   R. Gene Simmons, 47, is charged with murdering two former
co-workers during a 45-minute period last Dec. 28. Jim Chaffin, 33,
and Kathy Kendrick, 24, were slain during a spree that prosecutors
contend was motivated by a desire for revenge.
   Simmons' trial is scheduled to begin May 9 at Ozark after being
moved from Pope County, where the deaths occurred.
   Simmons, a retired Air Force master sergeant, also is charged
with two counts of capital murder for the deaths of 14 relatives
whose bodies were found on his property near Dover after the
Russellville slayings. Prosecutors allege that Simmons shot or
suffocated the 14 during the Christmas holidays. No trial date has
been set for those charges.
   Prosecutors brought more than 40 pieces of evidence to the
courtroom Monday, including pistols that were used in the
Russellville killings.
   Attorneys for Simmons argued that the search of Simmons' home
prior to the issuance of a search warrant was an unconstitutional
violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from
unreasonable searches. The lawyers asked Pope County Circuit Judge
John Patterson to suppress the evidence found on Simmons' property.
   The judge did not rule on suppressing evidence in the deaths of
Simmons' relatives. One capital murder charge in that case arises
from the discovery of five bodies in Simmons' home, and the second
stems from the discovery of nine others in a shallow grave near the
house and in the trunks of two abandoned cars on the property.
   Defense attorneys contend the state's ability to collect
evidence in the case would not have been hindered had authorities
postponed the search until a search warrant was issued.

   With each vote, the high spirits of
supporters of impeached Gov. Evan Mecham sank lower and lower
Monday.
   Aye. Aye. Aye. A few Mecham opponents cheered, but most outside
the Arizona Senate building booed and a few shed tears as the votes
continued.
   The carnival-like party, which included a trumpet quartet and a
country 'n' western duo throughout the day, was over.
   ``I feel betrayed by our Legislature. I had more faith in
them,'' said Mecham supporter Millie Pratt. ``I really felt he
would win. It should have been close. I don't know what happened.''
   The crowd, which had dwindled to 200 or so by the time of the
roll call votes, huddled around portable televisions and radios to
listen as the state Senate decided to remove Mecham from office.
   The loudest cheer of the afternoon came when the Senate declined
to invoke the ``Dracula clause'' _ a measure that would have barred
Mecham from holding future offices.
   ``It's not over. It's only beginning. We're not going to quit,''
said supporter Virginia Archer, who predicted Mecham will be able
to run in and win a recall election set for May 17.
   ``It's no surprise,'' said Mecham supporter Andy Cosentino.
``It's a kangaroo court.''
   A few anti-Mecham believers cheered the ``aye'' votes for
conviction on the impeachment charges. ``I'm very happy and
relieved. I think he's a menace, and I think he's clearly guilty of
malfeasance,'' said Barry Gabriel, who carried a sign saying simply
``Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.''
   Mecham waved the crowd and smiled as he left. And the gathering
sang ``God Bless America.''
   Earlier, some 300 supporters staged an 11th hour protest and
mock funeral for the Arizona Constitution, complete with trumpters
playing ``Taps'' and pallbearers toting a black wooden coffin.
   It turned out to be a burial for Mecham's administration.
   ``It's a sad story. These people (anti-Mecham senators) made up
their minds months ago. We all know it. But we have come out to
show support and hope somebody changes their mind at the last
minute,'' said Theo Putnam.
   Lula Crosby, a retired junior high school teacher, held an
American flag high for two hours.
   ``The flag stands for justice, purity and honesty _ all the good
things,'' she said. ``We hope that they (Senators) are on the right
track and they give us justice and not take our vote away from us.''
   Some wore railroad attire and blew a train-like whistle, and
paper train tracks were laid across the plaza because, Mecham
supporters said, the embattled chief executive was being railroaded
by the Legislature.
   They chanted ``We love you, governor'' as Mecham arrived,
looking subdued and giving only a brief thumbs-up sign as he
entered the Senate. A ``Thank Heaven For Evan'' sign was taped to
the building.
   The demonstration was punctuated by a trumpted quartet imported
by supporters from Los Angeles that opened with ``America'' from
``West Side Story.'' A woman passing out Mecham's book, ``Come Back
America,'' danced to the refrains.
   Cindy Biggs woke up her three children _ ages 4, 2, and 9 months
_ at 6:30 a.m. to join the crowd. She wore a T-shirt proclaiming
Mecham ``The best governor Arizona had.''
   ``If they're messing with my governor, I'll be down here to
support him,'' she said.
   Sharon Crandall donned maid-like attire and carried a broom and
a sign saying ``It's time for a good house cleaning in our
Capitol.''
   ``I think they know Gov. Mecham is innocent. If they can
withstand the pressure of the power establishment in Arizona,
they'll vote no and Gov. Mecham will be released,'' she said.
   A seven-car funeral procession circled the Capitol, led by a
white station wagon carrying the coffin. On top of the black casket
was a sign proclaiming ``Herein Lies the Right to an Elected
Governor.'' The crowd also sang songs, including some homemade
refrains that included verse like ``...And we'll all be glad when
Evan comes marching home.''

   Some lawmakers were given police
protection Monday night after receiving threats prompted by the
state Senate vote to remove impeached Gov. Evan Mecham from office,
officials said.
   ``A lot of threatening calls had been placed'' to senators'
offices and homes, said Allan Schmidt, spokesman for the state
Department of Public Safety.
   ``They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' Schmidt
said.
   During the impeachment process, state and local police had
stepped up security for Legislators, Schmidt said. After the vote,
some were receiving protection. ``We felt they'd be more
comfortable,'' he said.

   Gov. Evan Mecham sat solemnly, showing
virtually no emotion, as the Senate convicted him of two
impeachment counts Monday and removed him from office.
   ``I think he gave me the impression that he was almost resigned
to the fact that he knew it was coming,'' said defense attorney
Jerris Leonard, who sat next to the first-term Republican at the
defense table.
   The governor said little to his attorneys as senators announced
their votes _ some so softly that they could not be heard from the
gallery, said Leonard.
   The governor listened as senators denounced him as a liar and
accused him of misusing the power he gained when he took office in
January 1987.
   But minutes later, Mecham smiled broadly as he met reporters in
a Senate hallway and left the building to loud cheers from
supporters.
   ``Well, they (senators) don't like my politics so we finished a
political trial; it's as simple as that,'' he said. He was not
required to attend the Senate vote, and Leonard said earlier Monday
he had advised Mecham not to.
   The governor's political opponents weren't celebrating as they
voted to make Mecham the first U.S. governor impeached and removed
from office in neaerly six decades.
   ``There's no joy in anyone's hearts today,'' said Assistant
Minority Leader Lela Alston, a Democrat who voted to convict on
both counts. ``I'm heartsick.''
   ``I think it's a sad day for everyone when we have to vote to
impeach our governor,'' said Democratic Sen. Peter Rios, who also
voted to convict Mecham of obstructing justice and misusing money
from the governor's protocol fund.
   Sen. Peter Kay, a Republican, said, ``It's a relief so that we
can get back to our business.''
   Even those who voted in Mecham's favor did not say positive
things about the governor, instead maintaining he did nothing to
warrant removal.
   Sen. Jan Brewer, a Republican who voted in Mecham's favor, said
the governor's actions were ``grossly inadequate, even seriously
incompetent _ but I don't find it purposely obstruction of
justice.''
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, Governor Mecham has struck out,''
announced Democrat Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera, who voted against the
governor on both counts. ``The citizens of this state will not
tolerate this evil insensitivity'' to the Arizona Constitution, he
said.
   Republican Sen. Tony West addressed his comments to Mecham
directly, saying, ``It's obvious now ... that you will no longer be
the governor of the state of Arizona.''
   ``Many people across this state believe in you and believe in
you passionately ... and I think you abrogated the trust of people
who have so passionately believed in you,'' West said.
   West said Mecham's ability to tell the truth was ``in a state of
bankruptcy'' and read from a book that psychoanalyzed people who
habitually lie.

   The Arizona Senate convicted Gov. Evan
Mecham on Monday of attempting to thwart a death-threat
investigation and misusing funds, making him the first U.S.
governor impeached and removed from office in 59 years.
   Acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, became governor the moment
the gavel fell to close the 21-9 vote to convict on the first
charge, obstruction. Two-thirds of the 30-member, GOP-controlled
Senate was needed for conviction.
   The Senate then convicted the first-term Republican 26-4 on a
charge he misused $80,000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his
auto dealership.
   Mecham, who took notes in the Senate chamber as lawmakers voted,
sat solemnly, showing little emotion.
   ``Well, they don't like my politics so we finished a political
trial,'' said the 63-year-old Mecham as he left the somber Senate
chamber. Asked what he intended to do next, Mecham said, ``We'll
decide tomorrow.''
   He left the building with a smile and a wave to scores of
supporters cheering and singing ``God Bless America.''
   The vote ended a year-and-a-half of controversy that shook
staunchly Republican Arizona and brought ridicule and criticism
from politicians, comedians and the comic strip ``Doonesbury.''
   Mecham, a former auto dealer who was elected in 1986 on his
fifth try in a three-way race with 40 percent of the vote, had
offended blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with offhand remarks
and official actions.
   A motion to bar him from ever holding state office in Arizona
fell three votes short of a two-thirds majority, with 17 in favor
and 13 opposed.
   The last governor to be impeached and removed from office was
Henry Johnston of Oklahoma, who was removed in 1929.
   Mrs. Mofford, in a statement, declared ``the end of some
difficult times in Arizona,'' and urged residents to purge ``our
hearts of suspicion and hate.''
   ``Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,''
she said. ``We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as
Arizonans.''
   The 192-seat gallery was nearly full and there was a buzz in the
somber chamber after each vote Monday.
   Outside the building, 200 Mecham supporters and opponents
followed the proceedings on TV sets and radios. Each side cheered
as votes favorable to their side were cast.
   ``I feel betrayed by our Legislature. I had more faith in
them,'' said Millie Pratt of Mesa.
   ``I'm very happy and relieved. I think he's a menance,'' said
Barry Gabriel, who carried a sign reading, ``Guilty. Guilty.
Guility.''
   There are 19 Republicans and 11 Democrats in the Senate. On the
first and decisive charge against Mecham, 10 Republicans and all 11
Democrats voted to convict; nine Republicans voted to acquit.
   On the second count, 15 Republicans and 11 Democrats voted yes;
four Republicans voted no. On whether to bar Mecham from future
office, nine Republicans and eight Democrats voted for exclusion,
10 Republicans and three Democrats voted against.
   ``The citizens of this state will not tolerate this evil
insensitivity,'' said Democratic Sen. Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera in
voting to convict.
   Republican Sen. Jan Brewer said she felt Mecham ``made a serious
error,'' but she added, ``I do not think it is sufficient to remove
him from office.''
   ``The vote is 21 ayes, nine nos. Evan Mecham is convicted of
high crimes, misdemeanors and malfeasance in office,'' said the
trial's presiding officer, Arizona Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon
Jr., after the vote on the first count.
   ``There's no joy in anyone's hearts today,'' said Assistant
Minority Leader Lela Alston, a Democrat who voted to convict on
both counts. ``I'm heartsick.''
   The combative Mecham drew fire for rescinding a Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday, a move that prompted of boycott of Arizona by
organizations looking to hold conventions in Arizona, and defending
the use of the word ``pickaninny'' for black children. He also came
under attack for appointments deemed unqualified, including a tax
official who didn't file his taxes.
   The House voted 46-14 to impeach Mecham Feb. 5 on the two counts
on which he was convicted and a charge of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan. The Senate dismissed the third charge during the
six-week trial.
   Mecham also faced a recall election May 17 and is scheduled for
trial in court April 21 on felony charges of concealing the
$350,000 loan. The question of whether he may run in the recall
election is likely to be decided in court, said Attorney General
Bob Corbin.
   Corbin said earlier that the recall election would be held as
scheduled whether Mecham was in office or not, and that the
governor in office at the time _ Mrs. Mofford _ would have to run
in the election to remain in office.
   Because the Senate didn't bar Mecham from holding office in the
future, supporters held out hope for a victory in the recall
election. ``It's not over; it's only beginning. We're not going to
quit now,'' said Virginia Archer of Phoenix.
   The Senate, after voting, adjourned for the day and said it
would reconvene Wednesday to hear any motions from attorneys.
   In Atlanta, news of Mecham's removal brought cheers from
hundreds at a banquet held in memory of King by the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. Mecham's removal came exactly 20
years after the civil rights leader's assassination.
   ``I can't rejoice at anyone's misfortune. I think justice has
been served. I hate to rejoice ... but somehow I feel good about
this impeachment,'' said SCLC president Joseph Lowery.
   Some lawmakers were given police protection Monday night after
receiving threatening phone calls prompted by the vote, said Allan
Schmidt, spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety.
   ``They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' Schmidt
said.
   The voting by the Senate began after the prosecutor, Paul
Eckstein, beseeched the lawmakers to convict and remove Mecham and
``bring down the curtain on this prolonged, embarrassing and bitter
tragedy.''
   On the obstruction charge, Mecham was accused of telling Ralph
Milstead, the state's top police official, not to cooperate with
the state attorney general's probe of an alleged threat against a
former aide who was about to testify before a grand jury
investigating Mecham's finances.
   The threat allegedly was made by Lee Watkins, a Mecham campaign
fund-raiser and state official. Watkins, an ex-convict, was said to
have warned that Donna Carlson would go on a ``long boat ride'' if
she didn't keep quiet. He denied any wrongdoing.
   Mecham testified he did not consider the alleged threat a
serious matter.
   The governor was also accused of misusing $80,000 from a fund
consisting of contributions raised from Mecham's inaugural.
   The prosecution charged that the funds were public money for use
in promoting Arizona and that Mecham took out the loan because his
dealership was in financial trouble; Mecham claimed that the money
was private and that he borrowed it only to give the state higher
interest than it was receiving.
   ``I urge you to consider that by allowing (Mecham) to return to
office to wreak havoc once again upon this state you will have
redefined in the most shameful way what is acceptable conduct for a
public official,'' Eckstein argued Monday.
   ``Let the people decide,'' said defense attorney Jerris Leonard,
urging senators to acquit the governor and let him defend his
office in the recall election.
   ``I ask you, where's the beef?'' another defense attorney, Fred
Craft, said of the evidence. ``You are being asked to politically
assassinate Governor Mecham, by those who would politically gain
from his demise.''

   Here is a summary of the articles of
impeachment on which the state Senate convicted Gov. Evan Mecham on
Monday.
   OVERALL CHARGE: Mecham, while acting in his official capacity,
committed high crimes, misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.
   OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE: Mecham knowingly attempted, by means of
misrepresentation or intimidation, to obstruct, delay or prevent
the communication of information or testimony relating to a
violation of a criminal statute to the Arizona attorney general.
   Specifically, Mecham ordered Ralph Milstead, the director of the
Arizona Department of Public Safety, not to cooperate with the
attorney general's investigation into an alleged threat by state
prison construction chief Lee Watkins against Donna Carlson, a
former Mecham aide.
   This charge was approved 21-9, one vote more than the required
two-thirds majority.
   MISUSE OF FUNDS: Mecham authorized a loan of $80,000 out of
funds held by the Office of the Governor to Mecham Pontiac Corp.,
the stock of which he and his wife owned. The money, originally
from the Mecham Inaugural Committee, was loaned without lawful
authority, and the loan was a knowing unauthorized use.
   This charge was approved 26-4.

   A congressional commission formed to study
Medicare payments to physicians recommended today that a national
fee schedule be pegged to the relative value of the work performed
by different types of doctors.
   The Physician Payment Review Commission's recommendation is
controversial because it almost certainly will pit medical
speciality against medical speciality in assigning a relative value
to each doctor's work.
   How, for example, would such a scale compare the value of one
hour of brain surgery with a like time spent by a heart surgeon, or
an internist treating a diabetic?

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Monday
sidestepped differences with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
on a Middle East peace conference and kept a U.S. peace plan alive
by focusing on Palestinian self-rule.
   ``We do have a sense of movement,'' a senior U.S. official told
reporters after Shultz met separately with Shamir, Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   A senior Israeli defense official, however, said the government
remained deadlocked and the only way to gain acceptance of the plan
would be for Shultz to persuade King Hussein of Jordan to accept it.

   In this nation of 1 billion people, who are
multiplying faster than the government wants, Dr. Zhang Lizhu is
working to help infertile couples have the one baby Chinese law
allows.
   The Beijing Medical University researcher recently saw the
success of three years of work when a 39-year-old primary school
teacher bore China's first test-tube baby, a girl.
   The birth, nearly 10 years after the world's first test-tube
baby, Louise Joy Brown, was born in England, was celebrated as a
national achievement, proof that China can master advanced medical
procedures.
   It also was a sign of the government's relatively recent support
for programs to help the infertile, overcoming opponents who argue
that the last thing China needs is more babies.
   Large families once were a tradition in China, and boys were
favored because they could help support the family later on. But
with the population burgeoning, the government instituted rigorous
birth control measures in the late 1970s and each couple was
restricted to one child. The government's goal is to achieve zero
population growth by the year 2000.
   The penalties for couples who have more than one child can a
fine and the loss of valued government or work benefits.
   But there was rejoicing when Zheng Mengzhu, the 8{-pound,
test-tube girl was born March 10, for it meant a breakthrough for
those couples unable to have the one child permitted by law.
   Mengzhu's picture and her mother's were published on the front
pages of leading newspapers, and China Central Television broadcast
an operating-room interview with the mother after the delivery by
Caesarean section.
   ``If she's clever enough and studies hard I want her to become a
doctor or lawyer,'' said the mother, Zheng Guizhen, who spent her
entire nine months of pregnancy in the hospital to ensure nothing
went wrong.
   ``Everything was smooth,'' said Mrs. Zhang, the doctor. ``She
had some morning sickness but no high blood pressure.''
   But Mrs. Zhang is taking no chances with this baby, a small
symbol of China's progress in medicine. She isn't letting the
mother and child make the arduous, four-day trip to the family's
home in rural northwest China until the weather is warmer and the
baby is several months old.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Zhang is closely watching the progress of a
woman pregnant with China's second test-tube child, due in May.
   She also has conducted two gamete fallopian transfers, an
alternate method of artificial fertilization in which the doctor
places the mother's eggs and father's sperm together in the woman's
Fallopian tubes, instead of in a laboratory dish.
   Mrs. Zhang's first attempt ended in a miscarriage, but the
second resulted in the birth of Zheng Mengzhu.
   Mrs. Zhang, aided by eight other doctors, began her test-tube
baby program in 1984 at the Beijing Medical University's No. 3
Teaching Hospital. In 1986, the government made producing a
test-tube baby one of the goals of China's Five-Year Plan, and
appointed Mrs. Zhang to head the effort.
   The government allocated the yuan equivalent of only $108,000
for the task, a sum Mrs. Zhang said showed ``spiritual support''
but fell far short of the need.
   To observe the procedure in action, she and two assistants
visited doctors in the United States who did pioneering work in the
field.
   But her own relatively primitive laboratory facilities, she
said, could not match those of the American doctors. In winter, she
had trouble just keeping the lab warm enough for the delicate egg
and sperm cultures. Many Chinese public buildings have little or no
heat.
   Mrs. Zhang said she implanted artifically fertilized eggs in the
wombs of 14 patients without success before the two pregnancies
resulted.
   ``I feel just a bit relieved that I fulfilled what I said I
would,'' Mrs. Zhang said after Mengzhu's birth. ``Actually it's
nothing very outstanding _ it's almost the 6,000th test-tube baby
worldwide _ but in China I think it's very hard to do this work due
to our facilities and public opinion.''
   Many believe China has no need for artificial fertilization when
the natural birth rate threatens to outpace the food supply.
   ``One of the reasons we started this program quite late is that
we knew there would be different opinions,'' Mrs. Zhang said.
``Everybody knows China is overpopulated.''
   But the law permits all couples to have one child, she added,
even the infertile. She said hundreds of women have written or
visited to seek her help, some in tears because of family pressure
to produce a child, especially a son.
   ``Probably the woman will be mistreated by her mother-in-law
because she can't give birth,'' Mrs. Zhang said. ``Some even think
of suicide.''
   Mrs. Zheng, China's first test-tube mother, said as she
breastfed her baby, ``Most people can't understand how a woman
suffers when she hasn't had a baby.
   ``For 20 years, I expected I would have a child but couldn't. If
Dr. Zhang had not given me a child I would not have wanted to keep
living.''
   China does not keep statistics on the number of infertile
couples. Mrs. Zhang estimated that about 50,000 women might be
candidates for test-tube fertilization, but emphasized that no
studies have been done.
   Traditionally, women who could not become pregnant made
offerings to the Earth God and ate herbs believed to increase
fertility. Mrs. Zhang said some herbs appear to help in individual
cases, although the reason has not been researched.
   Since 1981, sperm banks have opened in several major cities,
including Beijing, Canton, Shanghai and Chungking. They have
claimed dozens of pregnancies.
   At least four hospitals or research institutes in addition to
the Beijing Medical University have begun test-tube baby programs,
although none has yet produced a pregnancy.

   China's first male sexual disorders clinic
treats sterile and impotent men with a secret method used in old
imperial courts. Across town, barren women get the secret
``shuangshuang'' (double-double) treatment, based on other old
remedies.
   Doctors at these clinics in Harbin, the capital of the
northeastern province of Heilongjiang, say they have been markedly
successful with their unique combination of Western and Chinese
traditional medicine.
   At the Center for Treatment and Consultation of Sexual Disorders
of Men, doctors refer cryptically to the imperial cure by the code
name ``8311'' and will only say that it involves herbs, minerals
and animal parts used in Chinese traditional medicine.
   At the Center for Treatment and Consultation of Sexual Disorders
of Women, barren women undergo daily double-double treatments,
which involve injections of a liquid medication into the genitals
and rectum.
   But, once again, the doctors will not divulge detailed
information, saying only that it is a concoction of herbs used in
traditional Chinese medicine.
   ``It is a secret,'' said Dr. Shi Ling, director of the
Obstetrical and Gynecological Hospital of Harbin. ``We have not
published it yet.''
   However, the doctors are happy to talk about their successes.
   Sixty to 70 percent of the 125 sterile or impotent patients who
have been treated with ``8311'' were cured, said Dr. Ma Ran, deputy
director of the No. 4 Hospital of Harbin.
   At least 11 of 33 women given the double-double treatment have
become pregnant, Shi said. However, the clinic has not been to
follow up on all its patients, and Shi suspects the pregnancy
figures might be higher.
   Even more impressive, though, is the claim by Dr. Zhao Tieyan of
the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Shenyang, in
neighboring Liaoning province.
   According to the English-language newspaper China Daily, Zhao
has treated 90,000 men for sterility and 75 percent of them later
fathered children.
   The report did not give any details about her treatment or the
composition of the medication she developed from her study of
Chinese traditional medicine.
   The double-double treatment was developed by Guo Hengsheng, a
doctor of Western medicine who had also studied Chinese traditional
medicine.
   Its name derives from the two injections and the heating of the
woman's abdomen and back.
   The treatment is supposed to reduce infection and inflammation
in the pelvic area that may be blocking pregnancy.
   Following the injections, the women undergo several hours of
heat treatment, huddling under layers of heavy quilts and on top of
electric blankets.
   The women undergo treatments every day for a week, then have a
week off. The treatment period can be as short as one week or as
long as several months.
   ``We know it works when they get pregnant,'' Shi said.

   Ko Suk-je lined up 50 pairs of roller
skates in neat rows as a spring breeze whipped across the square
and hundreds of people whirled around on bikes and skates.
   ``Spring is the best season; everyone comes out,'' Ko said with
a smile as he tugged on his red baseball cap.
   Another bitterly cold Korean winter has come and gone. A pale
spring sun drew out crowds from thousands of small apartments where
they had been cooped up for five months.
   Purple and yellow blooms were just starting to unfold on trees
and bushes on the edges of Yoido square.
   The mile-long tarmac square is one of the few open spaces in the
bustling city of 10 million, and people flock to it once warm
weather arrives.
   The city, main site of the 1988 Summer Olympics, has few public
parks or other open areas and many people live in drab concrete
apartment buildings that stretch for miles around the city.
   ``There's no space in Seoul,'' said Ko, the skate renter. ``This
is the only place in the city where there's space.''
   On this balmy day, students, children and whole families had
come to Yoido to rent bikes or roller skates and just ride round
and round.
   ``We feel free,'' said Kim Mi-ji, a college student who was
skipping afternoon classes to go bike riding with her friends. ``We
enjoy ourselves a lot.''
   Thousands of bikes and skates were lined up on one side of the
square, waiting to be rented for about a dollar. Rows of shoes were
piled by the skates as their owners whirled across the square or
struggled to keep their balance.
   Children whooped and laughed as they darted around on red bikes
decorated with picutres of Rambo brandishing a grenade launcher.
   ``There's nowhere to ride bikes at home so we can't have them,''
said one boy.
   Everywhere across the city of giant office buildings and clogged
streets people were enjoying their first breath of spring. They
strolled the sidewalks or stood on street corners watching the
world go by and chatting with friends.
   Sidewalk vendors offered chestnuts, hot potatos and dried squid.
Women with stoves on carts fried onion pancakes and stirred pots
simmering with noodles in red pepper sauce.
   ``Flowers, flowers,'' shouted other vendors offering the first
red, blue and yellow blooms from the warmer south. Pedestrians
stopped to inspect the bouquets and some brought a bunch to take
home.
   A few vendors sold imported bananas for the equivalent of $1.25
each. Imported fruit is classified as a luxury and heavily taxed.
   Hundreds of old men stood around in large groups or strolled at
Pagoda Park, one of the few parks in central Seoul. Some played a
board game called Jangi and bets were changing hands.
   Most of the retirees were dressed in Western suits, but a few
wore traditional Korean fur hats, snug silk jacks and long, loose
linen pantaloons.
   Sidewalk fortune tellers did a brisk business as people came to
ask if the spring would bring luck or if romance was in the offing.
   ``Many people come to know their fortunes for the year,'' said
an old fortune teller, sitting on a blanket surrounded by
astrological charts in Chinese and Korean.
   Asked for his name, he laughed.
   ``I'm 70 years old,'' he said, waving a visitor away.

<HEAD>Political Debates Allowed Back on Chilean Television</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political debates are back on Chilean
television for the first time since the right-wing military seized
power 14 years ago.
   But government critics, including those who appearing on the
screen, contend that television access remains minimal and that
more airtime is needed to create an informed public for the
single-candidate presidential balloting planned for later this year.
   Chile has no commercial television. One national network is run
by the government. All other channels are operated by universities
that have been under government control since the military took
over in a 1973 coup.
   Political debates, a popular feature on television before the
coup, were prohibited by the military rulers, and general political
information was limited to the broadcast of government views.
   But that changed in January when the national university's
Channel 11 in Santiago began broadcasting a Sunday night program
called ``Currents of Opinion,'' a two-hour pre-recorded political
debate. Participants came from both the government and the
opposition.
   In March, Channel 13 of the Catholic University introduced
``Face the Nation,'' a live Monday night program in which three
journalists question representatives of a particular political
party.
   But the state television, the only one that broadcasts
nationally, has not yet followed suit.
   The return of political debates has coincided with a limited
increase in the coverage of opposition political parties on
television newscasts.
   Members of the opposition and some media experts, acknowledging
that they see some progress toward more balanced political
presentations on television, say it's still not enough.
   ``I think what television is doing is still absolutely
insufficient to give Chileans ample and pluralist information in
the face of the upcoming election campaign,'' said Jaime Moreno,
president of Chile's Journalists Association.
   The new debates indicate ``some progress,'' Moreno said in an
interview, but he added that the opposition still faces
discrimination in news programs.
   Chileans will vote later this year _ no date has been set _ for
or against a single, military-picked candidate who, if approved in
the referendum-style balloting, will serve as president from 1989
to 1997.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander who
led the 1973 coup, appears to be aggressively seeking the
nomination and is considered the most probable candidate.
   Chile's Roman Catholic Church and some foreign governments,
including the United States, have said equal access to television
is needed to ensure a fair election campaign and ensure the new
government's legitimacy.
   Enrique Krauss, a Christian Democrat who has represented his
party in several debates, said TV access remains too limited.
   ``Debates are not enough,'' Krauss said. ``The general news
coverage today continues to be dominated by a non-democratic line.''
   Hour-long nightly news programs commonly dedicate a half hour or
more to activities or comments by Pinochet and other officials, as
well as public works projects and other pro-government information.
   Figures compiled by a Santiago-based private social research
institute indicated that, during a five-day period in late January,
Santiago's TV channels devoted 75 minutes to government views on
political issues, and the opposition got 7 minutes, 54 seconds.
During the first week of March, coverage allocated to the
government was 88 minutes, with 2 minutes, 13 seconds for the
opposition.
   A similar report by the Christian Democratic Party concluded
that 98 percent of television's political coverage in 1987 was
devoted to pro-government news.
   Rene Abeliuk, a Social Democrat who has also participated in
several debates, said television's new approach to political
coverage ``is just a beginning that should be followed by a more
balanced coverage of the opposition views in the newscasts.''
   Participants in the debates say they have generally been allowed
to state their views without restrictions. Some of the topics of
the debates have been highly sensitive for the government, such as
alleged human rights violations.
   Television officials say they are working without government
interference.
   ``We are inviting anybody we want to participate in the debate,
and we intend to continue to do so,'' said Roberto Pulido, one of
the inteviewers on ``Face the Nation.''
   TV officials acknowledge that the political opening on
television is still limited. Juan Agustin Vargas, an executive of
the Catholic University television station, explained: ``Our
channel has done whatever it has been able to during these years.
And we've gradully been giving more political information.''
   Although TV political debates were popular before the military
coup, the new ones have not attracted the massive audiences some
expected.
   ``Currents of Opinion'' rose from a rating of 5.6 in the first
few weeks to around 11 March 27. The same day, another station got
39.9 points by showing ``The North and the South,'' the U.S.
mini-series set during the American Civil War.

<HEAD>African Languages Struggle Alongside French In Former Colonies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY PETER CHILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gregoire Dhomanse steps out the
door of his birthplace, he enters a world where no one speaks his
language.
   Dhomanse, a retired mason, lives in Blokauss, once a village on
a sleepy lagoon, whose inhabitants spoke a language called Ebrie.
   Now their village is a neighborhood in Abidjan, surrounded by
modern skyscrapers, super highways, shops and apartment buildings.
Gone are their fields of yams, cocoa and coffee.
   And like many other Africans, the people of Blokauss must speak
French to be understood outside their neighborhood.
   The Ivory Coast has about 60,000 Ebrie speakers, in Blokauss and
other villages along the coast. Their distinctive language and
culture are threatened by modern development, population growth and
the increasing reliance on French.
   ``The development can't be stopped,'' said Koutouan Cassien, a
retired primary school director, living in Blokauss. ``Our future
is the future of Ivory Coast.''
   The more dominant African languages are succeeding in taking
over the functions of European languages, said Joseph Opala, an
American linguist and anthroplogist at the University of Sierra
Leone, but he added: ``As major African languages gain in
importance many local African languages on the periphery will
undoubtedly become extinct.''
   Some African languages, such as Hausa, a widely spoken
commercial language in Niger and northern Nigeria, have adapted
well to European culture, said Malam Moussa, director of adult
literacy education in Niger. He added that Hausa has become a
richer language because of the adaptation.
   Many reasons are given for the demise of Africa's smaller
languages, but the influence of European culture and the growth of
dominant African languages play a part.
   In countries like the Ivory Coast, French became the principle
means of communications because none of its 50 tribal languages
became dominant. In Kenya, the emergence of Swahili kept English
from becoming the lingua franca.
   Ivory Coast's rapid economic development also accelerated the
dominance of French. The country also has a well developed
educational system, which has stressed French and pushed national
languages into the background.
   ``Africans are nervous that if their languages disappear, part
of them will disappear as well,'' said Kuadio Jeremie, director of
Institute of Applied Linguistics at the University of Abidjan. ``We
are in a position where we haven't fully adapted to European
culture, nor completely abandoned our own culture.''
   What has emerged in Africa is a system called ``diglossia,''
where European and African languages serve different functions in
society, said Opala.
   European languages, he added, were used on a formal level for
government and commerce. African languages were spoken informally
as street and traditional market languages.
   ``Words that represent new things are borrowed and adapted to
the language,'' said Moussa, a Hausa speaker. ``It's natural.''
   When automobiles arrived in Hausaland they were given the name
``mota,'' which is similar to the English motor. In Zimbabwe, Shona
speakers use ``motocari,'' an adaptation of motor car, the British
term for automobile.
   Some nations, both former French and English colonies, have
rejected demands that one tribal language be made their official
language on grounds it would risk polarizing different ethnic
groups.
   ``It's a question of political will,'' said Professor Niangoran
Bouah, an anthropologist at the University of Abidjan. ``Besides,
French has all the advantages the other languages don't. It is an
official language, a technical language, a work language and the
international diplomatic language.''
   Niger has shown that, even in former French colonies, local
languages can flourish. In 1973 it implemented an experimental
primary education system aimed at making students literate in their
own language. There are now 30 such schools providing an
alternative to the regular primary schools where only French is
used.
   Bouah said he believes Ivory Coast should introduce local
language instruction into the national educational system, but it
may be too late.
   ``We are well engaged in the development of French, and I wonder
if we will ever be able to return to maternal languages,'' he said.
   Local languages remain strong in former British colonies because
they were left alone, said George Kahari, a Zimbabwean linguist and
African literature scholar at the University of Zimbabwe.
   He noted that Zimbabwe, formerly British Rhodesia, has a strong
tradition of African literature published in local languages,
especially in Shona, the principle national language.
   On the other hand, ``the French insisted they were bringing a
cultured, civilized language to Africa and actively promoted its
domination over local languages,'' he said.

   EDITOR's NOTE _ Huntington's disease is a strange and
devastating affliction that has all but wrecked one small town in
Venezuela. Its lethal, inherited course through one large family
there, however, may help scientists find a treatment and a cure.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>LAGUNETA, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yelitza Margarita Cabrera, like many
budding 12-year-olds, has a crush on at least six boys her age.
   Chuchito, Jose Luis, another Chuchito. She rattles them off on
her rough hands, chipped pink polish on her short nails. A yellow
plastic butterfly clip gathers up her brown hair in a coquettish
tilt.
   Yelitza may have inherited from her father a terminal disease
that could leave her bedridden, unable to speak clearly or chew and
swallow easily by the time she's 50.
   By then, she may have had lots of children _ her grandparents,
Eduardo and Carmen Soto had 14 _ and passed the disease on to many
of them.
   Eduardo and Carmen both have Huntington's disease, formally
known as Huntington's chorea, which they know as Saint Vitus'
dance. It has been passed on through their family's genes for more
than six traceable generations.
   Their family's tragedy has, however, provided the basis for the
first concerted effort to find the cause of the disease and perhaps
learn to treat it or eradicate it.
   It was just this year that Dr. Anne Young, head of the neurology
department at the University of Michigan, diagnosed Yelitza's
father as having Huntington's disease, an inherited degenerative
disorder which affects seven to 10 out of every 100,000 people in
the world.
   American folk singer Woody Guthrie was a victim and his son,
Arlo Guthrie, and Arlo's four children are at risk. Young is very
suspicious about Yelitza.
   ``Her eye movements are a little...bit...off,'' she says with
matter-of-fact intensity. ``She's not...quite...right.''
   Young belongs to a Huntington's disease research team that has
been coming to Laguneta each March since 1981 to collect blood and
give neurological and psychological tests to its inhabitants. The
group is headed by Dr. Nancy Wexler of Columbia University's
neurology department.
   Wexler is also a founder and president of the California-based
Hereditary Disease Foundation, which coordinates Huntington's
research in five U.S. universities and one in London.
   The foundation has a five-year grant of just under $1 million
from the National Institutes of Health for Huntington's research.
   Laguneta and two other poor Venezuelan towns, Barranquitas and
San Luis, are a main element of the research.
   In these three villages live nearly all the members of the Soto
clan, the source of the largest documented family gene pool in the
world.
   Wexler and her associates have drawn up a 9,000-person family
tree that traces the spread of the gene defect that causes
Huntington's from a single woman, Maria Concepcion Soto, who died
of the disorder near Laguneta about 1880.
   The defect causes neurons in a certain part of the brain to
degenerate, resulting in gradual loss of control of voluntary
movement.
   Although disease is always fatal, the defect lives on because
the obvious symptoms of degeneration usually don't show up until
long after childbearing age.
   Eduardo used to be a fisherman, like everyone else in this tiny
village of 16 shacks on stilts 3 feet above Lake Maracaibo. You
reach the place by a four-hour cabin cruiser ride south from the
city of Maracaibo through a slalom course of oil rigs.
   Now he spends his days on the wooden plank floor of a daughter's
8-by-10-foot corrugated tin hut. His arms and legs jerk about
nervously, his head lolls, he can no longer talk.
   Eduardo can somehow make it to his feet and lurch outside to the
tiny porch of rotting logs, only to collapse next to a pile of damp
fish nets, smiling apologetically. Sometimes he falls overboard and
he has to be fished out.
   He is 65. At the rate his disease is progressing, he'll probably
die within a year or two.
   Yelitza's father, Angel Eduardo, one of Eduardo Soto's 14
surviving children, is still a fisherman at 37, as he has been
since the age of 10.
   He goes out every day with a few relatives in a long, narrow
motorized dinghy and brings in about 200 pounds of corvina, bagre
and other local fish.
   Angel Eduardo will be able to do this for five more years, maybe
a bit longer, doctors say.
   Then he won't be able to control his movements enough to fling a
net properly, or navigate. Someone in his family _ maybe Yelitza,
maybe her sister _will have to take care of him until he dies. That
could take 20 years.
   The 14 children of Eduardo and Carmen Soto already have 58 kids
of their own, all at risk of Huntington's disease. Yelitza is one
of them.
   Of the 14, four have double doses of the defective gene _ one
from Eduardo and one from Carmen. All of their children will get
the disease.
   Dr. James Gusella, a molecular biologist at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, examines the family's genes from the
1,500 blood samples Wexler and Young have collected since 1981.
Using the extensive genetic records of the Soto family, Gusella has
developed a test to identify Huntington's disease victims before
symptoms develop _ even before their birth.
   The test involves the use of so-called DNA markers, chemical
signposts on the deoxyribonucleic acid that makes up genes.

<HEAD>LAGUNETA, Venezuela: up genes.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Within a year or two, he may be able to find the defective
Huntington's gene itself, the first crucial step toward a treatment
or cure.
   Other research teams are now using this method to find genes
that cause other hereditary disorders, such as neurofibromatosis
(elephant man's disease), cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease and
manic depression.
   ``The difference in genetic research now and before 1983 is like
night and day, and it's because of this Venezuelan family,'' Wexler
says. ``They showed that the strategy of using DNA markers to find
genes is correct.''
   The current genetic test is up to 96 percent accurate, depending
on how closely related are the patients who give their blood for
genetic analysis.
   A false positive on the test, while unlikely, would prove
painfully significant, especially when it comes to having a family.
   Wexler knows this firsthand. She is at risk herself. Her mother
died of the disease, and Wexler has decided not to have kids and
not to take the test.
   ``I stand to lose a lot if I find I have it, and I stand to gain
very little if I find out I don't, since I'm happy now,'' she says.
``And I wouldn't want to subject my kids to being at risk or giving
them the disease.''
   The Soto clan remains resigned to living with a disease that has
plagued their family for as long as any of them can remember.
   A few of the women at Laguneta have IUD's, but they've already
had several children.
   The majority, however, think of it as something that is passed
on in a mysterious and unavoidable way and which may or may not be
``given'' to them.
   No one in Laguneta really understands why Wexler and her
associates come back year after year to get blood samples, give
them eye tests, and hand out food, medicine and secondhand clothing
and toys.
   They are not always cooperative. Some family members refuse to
give blood, others disappear for days.
   And even though a cure, or at least a test, could be developed
within a few years as a result of research based on the Soto
family, the disease is destroying Laguneta, and it may do the same
to the Sotos.
   As recently as 40 years ago Laguneta was the size of Congo, a
thriving fishing village on stilts about an hour away by motorized
launch.
   The 1,000 inhabitants of Congo have electricity, a school, a
visiting doctor, and a church. Television antennae poke up from the
wood or tin roofs and at least one person has a high-speed outboard
motorboat.
   The people in Congo are quick to point out to visitors that one
thing they do not have is Saint Vitus' dance.
   Laguneta, in contrast, now has only about 150 inhabitants
crammed in its 16 huts and a bleak, empty church with lots of bats
but no priest.
   Two of the huts have electricity. No teachers come, and except
for Wexler's research team, no doctors come either.
   The only dry way to go from hut to hut is with a boat and a pole.
   The boys play baseball, Venezuela's favorite sport, in the salty
water that reaches just above their bellies, bloated from
intestinal parasites. Sanitation is primitive or non-existent.
   ``I give them tons of anti-parasite medicine and in a week it
won't do them any good. What they need is education in hygiene,''
complains Dr. Juan Sanchez-Ramos, a University of Miami neurologist
and a member of Wexler's team.
   And when the disease hits a fisherman, like Yelitza's father, it
means one less breadwinner for the family and one more burden for a
sister or daughter.
   So even though what they earn from fishing is a decent living by
local standards, the Sotos can never quite pull out of their
poverty.
   ``Even the ones in San Luis are still illiterate because they're
too poor to send their kids to school _ they can't afford the
books,'' Young says. ``All their resources and energy go to caring
for their sick elders.''
   And everyone in Laguneta, it seems, wants to leave.
   They all talk of getting off the water and on to dry land, and
going to Barranquitas, where, unlike in Congo, Soto family members
can welcome them.
   San Luis, a poor outlying neighborhood of Maracaibo, is
considered the next step up the ladder.
   Unfortunately, beyond Laguneta the Sotos increasingly will be in
contact with people who know nothing about the disease.
   From a single woman, Maria Concepcion Soto _ whom Wexler
suspects inherited the defect from a European sailor _ the gene has
spread as the Sotos have more surviving children.
   In Laguneta, Barranquitas and San Luis, as in many similar poor
towns worldwide, sex begins at an early age.
   Yelitza is very likely to have her first child by the time she's
15, like her cousin, Yusmary Margarita Soto, whom Young also finds
suspicious.
   ``We know these kids are living time bombs,'' Wexler says. ``We
know when we're testing them that some of them will get sick, and
there is nothing in the world that would make us happier than to be
able to save them.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The setting is beautiful, the history is grim, a
tale of punishment disproportionate to the crime. Today, tourists
can happily shudder at the ghosts of Devil's Island and the
neighboring dots in the Atlantic off northern South America.
They'll pay a good price, but not the kind exacted from the hapless
inmates who once populated the penal colony on the ``Islands of
Salvation.'

   During their grim years of
imprisonment on Devil's Island, both Alfred Dreyfus, the martyr to
French anti-Semitism, and Papillon, the Marseilles safecracker,
reached the same conclusion.
   The breeze-swept, coconut palm-dotted island off the northern
coast of South America wouldn't be a bad place to spend a holiday
or even the rest of one's life if it weren't for the awful
isolation, the monotonous cuisine and the company of guards and
fellow convicts.
   Now tourists are discovering the charms of Les Iles du Salut,
the triangle of tiny islands with Devil's Island at the
northern-most apex, that for nearly 100 years, down to the end of
World War II, served as France's notorious penal colony.
   Motor launches from the occasional cruise ships calling at Ile
Royale, the main island, deposit eager, mostly elderly passengers
in the tiny harbor behind the rock jetty. Hundreds of convicts lost
their lives building it in that pounding surf.
   Luxury yachts bob at anchor in a picture-postcard cove near the
channel separating Royale from St.Joseph, where sharks used to
answer the 6 p.m. chapel bell tolling the burial at sea of another
``mec,'' as the inmates called themselves.
   Henri Charriere, alias ``Papillon,'' watched in horror one
evening as more than 100 sharks executed a deadly ballet with the
flour sack-shrouded body of his closest friend, lifting it high
above the water in their churning greed, despite the heavy rocks
and steel-wire trussing meant to sink the corpse from sight.
   There is no convict cemetery on the islands, but camera buffs
can focus their lenses on the graveyard for guards and their
families, where Papillon disrespectfully dug into a tomb to hide
sections of a boat he was assembling for a ``cavale,'' an escape
attempt.
   Postcards of the smaller, more picturesque cimetiere d'enfants,
the children's cemetery, are available in the gift shop in the
former guards' dining room. It also features, at rather larcenous
prices, photocopies of French front-page coverage of the 1894
Dreyfus treason trial and T-shirts made in Hong Kong declaring that
the wearer has accomplished ``L'Evasion,'' an escape from Ile du
Diable, Devil's Island.
   Some naughtier French postcards in cartoon style show guards'
wives sunbathing topless to torment ``relegues,'' less-dangerous
prisoners working in their gardens.
   The same long, low building has a small hotel with a notice on
the bulletin board that would have amused lifers Dreyfus and
Papillon: ``Checkout time 11 a.m.'' There is a snack bar and garden
bistro with prices, if not l'ambiance, worthy of a sidewalk cafe
along the Champs-Elysees.
   Two young officers from a cruise ship grumbled about ``this
place still being a den of thieves'' after paying $l2 for a beer
and a Pernod. But the menu listing hot dogs at $3.50 did not seem
to discourage a rush to the tables by sightseers arriving from the
capital at Cayenne on the noon helicopter. The chopper lands in the
meadow where guards used to test the guillotine by inserting banana
stalks beneath the blade.
   Taking advantage of the visitor has long been part of the
hospitality on Les Isles du Salut, the ``salvation islands.''
   Papillon recounted in the best-seller memoirs he transcribed in
13 school copybooks how the ``original'' Dreyfus coffee mug and the
``authentic'' Dreyfus mess tray, inscribed with his initials, were
sold over and over again to the gullible Breton seamen who every
two years delivered from France a ``convoy'' of up to l,800
convicts, handcuffed and chained to each other by the ankles.
   A boatman will row the tourist the few hundred yards from Royale
over to Devil's Island and show him the stone bench where Capt.
Dreyfus stared longingly in the direction of the France that had
wrongly accused him of being a German spy and where Papillon, who
thought himself wrongly convicted of murdering a Montmartre pimp,
sat for hours, day after day, patiently plotting his l0th and at
last successful escape attempt. From the initials carved on the
palm trees and the graffiti scrawled on the cell blocks now
overgrown by the jungle it's hard to tell which memorabilia were
inscribed by tourists and which by inmates. They began to arrive in
1854 when Napoleon III conceived a penal colony in French Guiana
for ``our worst bandits.''
   When asked who would guard them, he replied, ``even worse
bandits.''

   Like Dreyfus and Papillon, visitors disembarking at Ile Royale
first see the lighthouse, the bakery and the stone boathouse that
for a few hours, until the last helicopter leaves, serves as
headquarters for the air patrol. They are the only police on the
island, which has a year-round population of 20.
   ``There is no crime here at all now,'' laughed a wife of one of
the caretakers, hanging out clothes to dry in the flower-decked
breezeway of what once was a row of cottages for staff and guards'
families.
   The main penitentiary buildings are atop a 600-foot high plateau
reached by a winding red dirt road built by convicts.
   Crumbling and ensnared by huge vines and tree roots, the maximum
security wing and its dungeons are a mecca for camera buffs. They
must be alert for the tarantula colonies that horrified Papillon.
The prison hospital and the chapel are the next most popular
attractions sought out on the tourist locator maps.
   Besides its shark-calling sunset bell, the chapel offers some
poignant, realistic frescoes executed over the years by the
inmates. One depicts Christ preaching from a boat on the Sea of
Galilee against an almost three-dimensional background of green and
brown Judean hills. Another shows the Prodigal Son beaming a
beatific smile of gratitude for the forgiveness shown by his
tearful father.
   The faces, all drawn from convict models, are unforgettable, but
one need not be astonished. After all, Luis Dega, Papillon's
dormitory mate, was a past master at transforming 500-franc
national defense bonds into 10,000-franc denominations.
   On the veranda of what had been the warden's house, two
maintenance men spent the siesta break playing cards under
friendlier rules than prevailed in the old penal days when a knife
fight decided who would deal the two-francs-a-point game of belote.
   A lovely woodland trail, fragrant with frangipani and alive with
the screeching of exotic birds, winds down to a turquoise cove
where suddenly three enormous sea turtles surface. These
400-pounders may have been mere youngsters when Papillon dived for
lobsters off these jagged rocks. Lizards and peccaries, tropical
wild hogs, darted from the underbrush.
   Just across the water, ``grim and green'' as Papillon called it,
looms Devil's Island. At the water's edge of ``that enormous rock
covered with coconut palms'' could be seen a few of the cottages,
painted yellow with gray tin roofs, where the political prisoners
like Dreyfus spent their exile.
   Actually, this smallest and rockiest of the three penal islands
was the least brutal.
   St. Joseph, now almost completely overgrown, was the worst. Its
single large building, barely visible at the crown of a low hill,
housed the prison within a prison, ``la reclusion disciplinaire.''
This was the solitary confinement unit, ``La Mangeuse d'hommes'' _
the devourer of men _ a cement block of 250 cells, back to back,
behind 4-foot-thick walls, roofed with iron bars. The dreaded
cubicles had no windows, only a tiny iron wicket. Every week the
prisoner stuck out his head to receive a haircut from a trustee
armed with huge garden shears. When the doctor called, once a
month, the other end was protruded.
   Here, pacing back and forth ``like a caged leopard, five steps,
turn and graze the wall,'' Papillon spent nearly four years. ``We
don't try rehabilitation here,'' the warden welcomed him. ``We try
to break you. We have only one rule: Keep your mouth shut. Absolute
silence.''
   A ``reclusionnaire'' could have months added to his sentence for
just mumbling ``merci'' to the guards for his pot of watery soup at
noon or the unvarying plate of lentils at dusk. Both guards and
prisoners wore slippers to muffle even the sounds of silence.
   Even now an unsettling serenity seems to hang over this
abandoned island.
   Now one wonders if these lovely islands, with their gorgeous
empty beaches and sparkling blue lagoons, can be saved from pillage
by builders and developers. Already there are rumors of bulldozing
the crumbling prison walls and ruins to make way for hotels,
condos, boutiques, discos, cabanas and, no doubt, a marina and a
casino.
   Surely, that would be a crime. But, alas and alors, crime is
what these islands have always been all about.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ President Reagan's AIDS commission appeared to
be a sinking ship when a retired Navy admiral took the helm last
fall. Adm. James D. Watkins guided the commission through
exhaustive hearings that resulted in recommendations that were
widely praised. The admiral is the first to concede, however, that
the commission has yet to deal with some of the thorniest questions
swirling around AIDS.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adm. James D. Watkins remembers the advice
that some of his closest friends offered when he asked them if he
should take the helm of President Reagan's embattled AIDS
commission.
   ``James, it's a loser. Stay out of it.''
   That was last October. The commission was sinking fast in a
choppy sea of public ridicule and internal disarray. The first
chairman, a physician unschooled in the ways of backstage
Washington, had resigned. Critics were portraying the panel as a
hopeless collection of doctrinaire, archconservatives sprinkled
with a few doctors who, nonetheless, knew little about AIDS.
   ``I knew it was a can of worms of the first order,'' Watkins
sats.
   But he did not rise to chief of naval operations by doubting his
own abilities. Moreover, he was a Washington veteran.
   As a result, Watkins was more disposed to listen to other
friends who told him: ``I don't know anybody else who could do it.
I think you ought to try it.''
   Still, Watkins knew his commission colleagues would not
automatically salute his elevation to chairman.
   ``I knew I would need their support at the outset, so I made
some calls,'' he recalled in a recent interview. ``I'd say, `What
do you want? Do you want me to do it or not? You've got to let me
run it if I'm going to do it.'
   ``I got a positive response from all the commissioners. I knew
then I could probably make it. There was no divisiveness. They knew
they were in trouble. They all had professional reputations at
stake. They saw in me an opportunity.''
   Run it he did.
   Watkins presented 60 pages of detailed ``chairman's
recommendations'' for the commission's approval on Feb. 29,
including a call for spending an additional $20 billion over the
next decade, most of it on drug abusers. Three days later, in a pro
forma business meeting that took all of 10 minutes, the panel
adopted them unanimously.
   In releasing the interim report, Watkins said, ``We waste a lot
of rhetoric and excessive time on a couple of little issues, while
the forest behind us is burning. We believe some major changes in
course are necessary.''
   The chorus of editorials lauding those recommendations was as
loud as the one writing off the commission as a lost cause six
months and nearly 400 witnesses earlier.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., a frequent critic of administration
AIDS policies, praised the Watkins report as a ``first-rate set of
recommendations that begin to deal with the AIDS epidemic
responsibly and in detail.''
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the Los Angeles-based
American Foundation for AIDS Research, said, ``I continue to get
more and more pleased as I see what Watkins is doing.''
   Admittedly, the suggestions in the report to the president do
not get at the thorniest questions swirling around AIDS.
   Watkins knows that. He ticks off the remaining ones in shorthand
form: ``Education, testing, confidentiality, discrimination, legal,
liability, pharmaceutical, doctors.''
   ``We're really going to face some toughies,'' he says. ``But
now, we're kind of trained. We've been through the mill together.''
   Watkins concedes that neither he nor the other members of the
original panel knew much about AIDS when they started.
   In retrospect, it is clear that Watkins went about managing the
AIDS commission much the way he operated in the Navy _ by immersing
himself and his associates in a problem until answers floated to
the surface.

   A favorite Watkins phrase is, ``The lights came on.''
   When he joined the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1982 as chief of
naval operations, Watkins said, ``I knew I had a weakness in the
area of strategic planning, strategic arms limitation talks. I
didn't have a good grasp of that area. I knew it was going to be
one of my primary responsibilities. So independent of anything else
going on...I started an education program for myself.
   ``I didn't know what the answer was going to be. I had no idea.
but by about January 1983 I had been in it up to my eyeballs with
my own staff.
   ``The light came on in my own mind: My God, why don't we play to
our strength instead of the Soviet strength. And our strength was
technology, applied technology, not theoretical technology.''
   From that ``light,'' as Watkins tells it, the other service
chiefs lined up with him in recommending to the president that he
consider moving to a defense-oriented nuclear strategy.
   Ergo, the emergence of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative _
SDI, Star Wars.
   ``I'm a strategy builder,'' Watkins says. ``That's my business,
knowing a lot about how to deal with large groups of individuals to
try to build programs that are built out of consensus, not out of
directive.
   ``This is the approach I tried to take with the commission:
Listen to the witnesses, package up what they were saying rather
than what was coming out of my preconceived notions that might be
there.
   ``It's taken us time to come up on this learning curve.''
   With so many witnesses telling the commission essentially the
same thing, Watkins heard the switches clicking again.
   ``The lights come on here,'' he said. ``In research. The lights
come on in care. We're uncovering major problems in the health care
delivery system. The lights come on in IV drug abuse and its
potential to be the longer term specter in AIDS transmission.''
   Indeed, if there is any criticism of the commission's initial
report on the relatively non-controversial AIDS issues dealt with
so far, it might be that the panel has yet to meet a recommendation
it didn't like. Most, but not all, involve spending more money.
   Watkins notes that the report is quite specific and that it is
not within the commission's charter to deal with government budget
priorities.
   The admiral and his wife of 37 years have reared six children on
a Navy salary. They have seven grandchildren. They are not wealthy.
   Before taking on the job as chairman of the AIDS commission,
Watkins, a member of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent
Development, was shaping what his resume calls ``a national program
for personal excellence in youth'' to emphasize good education,
good health and good motivation.
   Relying on foundation grants and charitable contributions, that
work allowed him to supplement his retirement pay _ modestly, he
says _ without running afoul of federal bans against retired
officers jumping immediately into the private and lucrative side of
the defense business.
   Other federal rules against ``double dipping'' bar Watkins from
being paid for his work on the AIDS commission. ``It's a big
chore,'' he says. ``It's a full-time job. I'm going to be hurt
(financially) by it. I've got to be sensitive to that.''
   When the commission expires this summer, Watkins says he wants
to continue his ``philanthropic work.'' But he also says he needs
to make some money.
   The one-year ban on his working for private defense companies
will have long since expired by then. Watkins is a graduate of the
nuclear reactor engineering course at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and he says work in commercial nuclear power industry is
one possibility.
   He acknowledges that his work on the AIDS commission is likely
to enhance his reputation and enable him to emerge as a much
better-known public figure than he was before.
   ``But it might not have worked out that way,'' he said.

   varying degrees of contact between adopted children and their
biological parents, is a drastic departure from the traditional

   When Lynn Cowsert gave her baby up
for adoption 20 years ago, she was required to sign a document that
said she was abandoning her son.
   Signing that piece of paper devastated Cowsert almost as much as
the thought of never seeing her child again.
   ``I was not abandoning my son,'' Cowsert, now 40, said from her
home in Traverse City. ``I was saying that I needed to give him a
family that could provide him with the things that I could not at
the time.''
   The wording of that release document was just one of the
negative connotations that adoption carried with it at the time.
   ``Our society made him ashamed of me,'' Cowsert says. ``They
were saying, `Here's this woman who dumped you,' when I was really
trying to make a positive statement by giving him up.''
   Knowing that her son will never know the details of his
background _ or his biological parents _ weighs heavy on Cowsert's
mind.
   ``And it will always hurt that I will never have the chance to
tell my son I love him and explain why I made the decision I did.''
   Cowsert's painful experience with the traditional, closed
adoption system has propelled her into the forefront of the open
adoption movement.
   She is now vice president of the Michigan Association for
Openness in Adoption, a new, non-profit organization formed to
promote the acceptance, education and research of open adoption.
   Open adoption can range from an anonymous exchange of
information and letters between the birth parents and adoptive
parents to pre-birth meetings between the two sides with a plan for
a continuing relationship after the child is born.
   While this method has been practiced for about 15 years in
varying degrees in a few places, the program in this northwestern
city on Michigan's Lower Peninsula is considered by many to be the
most progressive in the United States.
   Its founder, social worker James Gritter, has completed more
than 150 open adoptions in eight years as child welfare coordinator
at Community Family and Children's Services of Traverse City, the
social services arm of the Catholic Diocese of Gaylord.
   The organization is sponsoring the second National Conference on
Open Adoption in Traverse City, which was scheduled April 14-17.
   While most adoption agencies in the country are just beginning
to offer open adoption, generally in the form of a single meeting
between the birth mother and adoptive parents, very few will assist
in setting up an adoption involving continuing contact, says Reuben
Pannor, a former Los Angeles social worker who has written
extensively about open adoption.
   Pannor says the practice is most common in California, but that
the Traverse City program is ``as open'' as any he has seen.
   About 75 percent of all pregnant women who come to Gritter's
agency wind up requesting a fully open adoption, including
continuing personal contact with the child. Almost all want to
choose the adoptive parents from profiles of couples in the
agency's pool.
   Some women even choose to select the adoptive parents early in
the pregnancy and have them accompany her to doctor appointments
and act as natural childbirth coaches in the delivery room.
   ``In those cases, the adoptive parents can share that delicious
anxiety that adoptive parents in a closed placement never
experience,'' Gritter says. At the same time, the birth mother
receives the emotional support that often is otherwise unavailable.
   In most traditional adoptions, the birth and adoptive parents
are never identified to one another and the only information
exchanged involves the birth mother's medical history and racial
heritage.
   That was the way Mike Spry and his wife, Jean Rokos, always had
thought of adoption. When they first heard about open adoption, ``I
thought it was an absolutely crazy idea,'' Spry says.
   Four years later, the couple has two children adopted through
the Traverse City program.
   Now an enthusiastic supporter of open adoption, Spry founded and
is president of the state advocacy group for openness in adoption.
He and about 20 other adoptive parents in the association have
contributed to a book on their experiences, which is due out in the
fall.
   The main reason the Sprys changed their minds was their hope
that it would spare their children the emotional burden many
adoptees face due to the secrecy surrounding their biological
parents.
   The Sprys have kept the doors literally open for both birth
mothers.

   ``Part of the beauty of this program is that we were there when
they said goodbye to the babies, so we can fully appreciate just
what kind of sacrifice the birth mother has made,'' Spry says.
``Now I want to give something back. I want that person to be a
part of my life.''
   Amy Winn, 20, of East Lansing, the birth mother of the Sprys'
1-year-old son, says open adoption has been ideal for her.
   ``The reason I know that I'll never try to get him back is
because I can always know how he's doing and how much he's being
loved,'' she says.
   The potential for interference by the birth parent is a
criticism that Gritter hears often. He contends that the open
environment discourages harassment.
   ``When a woman enters our program, her whole plan is for the
child to do well in life and for her to know how the child is
doing. For her to misbehave in any way really only serves to
undercut her very own plan,'' Gritter says.
   The open adoption agreement is legally non-binding and either
party can pull out at any time.
   One of the major benefits is that the adoptive parents can be
licensed as foster parents so the baby can be placed with them
immediately after birth. In closed adoptions, the child must go to
a separate foster family for several weeks until the end of the
legal period during which the birth mother can change her mind.
   With the benefit of getting the baby early comes the risk that
the adoptive parents will have to give the baby back if the birth
mother changes her mind before signing the release papers.
   Fifteen percent of the women who enter the Traverse City program
decide to keep their babies before that legal period is over.
   Gritter said that's a positive.
   ``From the outset, our goal is to find a way to keep the baby
with the birth parents,'' he says. ``If the birth mother changes
her mind, we're with her 100 percent.''
   Such situations are difficult for the adoptive parents.
   The Sprys' second child was with them four days when they found
out his biological father was preparing to sue for custody. They
gave the baby back.
   ``The program prepared us for that possibility,'' Spry says.
``We never lost faith in the program. And we jumped right back into
it.''
   Critics say women who request open adoption often do so because
they're psychologically unready to part with the child.
   Gritter counters that it's perfectly natural for a woman to want
to remain part of the child's life. In fact, he worries about birth
mothers who seek a closed adoption.
   ``We worry that their motivation is a sort of denial and that
they won't come out of it as healthy as the birth parent who has
actively done what she could for their child,'' he says.
   The Traverse City program grew out of Gritter's desire to see
birth parents treated more humanely and to allow adoptees to have
as much autobiographical information as possible.
   He also believes that the principles on which confidential
adoption was originally based _ to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy
_ are obsolete.
   But leaders in the field of traditional adoption contend that
open adoption is based on the faulty premise that closed adoption
has not worked.
   ``There has never been reliable data to show that adopted
children suffer emotionally,'' says Jeff Rosenberg, spokesman for
the National Committee for Adoption, an adoption advocacy group
based in Washington, D.C.
   Rosenberg compares openness to joint custody in a divorce
settlement.
   ``It's not joint physical custody, but it is joint psychological
custody,'' he says.
   His biggest fear centers on the relative newness of open
adoption.
   ``There's no way to know what kind of effect this will have on
children,'' he says. ``What gives these people the right to
experiment with children's lives?''
   Gritter says the effects of open adoption won't be known until
the children mature and follow-up studies are done. But he predicts
that within 10 years all adoptions will feature some sort of
openness because birth parents will insist on it.
   ``Its underlying principles are that honesty and openness are
generally healthier than secrecy and deception,'' says Gritter.
``It's based on the idea that people are entitled to as much
information about themselves as possible, that they should have
access to the information that is vital for their sense of self.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A Michigan man seven years ago created LOVE
INC., a clearinghouse and referral service to link those in need
with the agency or group most able to help. It has now grown to a
network of 50 local programs in 14 states, involving 1,300 churches
of 50 denominations.

   One year ago Diana Huckaba was in almost
constant pain _ physical and mental.
   A spinal defect resulting from childhood scoliosis and worsened
by a later auto accident kept the Allendale woman in bed all day,
``thinking nobody cared.'' A single mother, she scraped by on
Social Security disability checks.
   Then her furnace broke.
   ``I had no money and didn't know where to turn,'' says Huckaba,
37. ``But as it turned out, that furnace breaking was the turning
point in my life.''
   When Huckaba called the heating company, she ended up speaking
to the local program director of LOVE INC. Before she knew it, she
had a new furnace. Soon after, she had a new outlook on life.
   In cases like these, LOVE INC. provides the missing link, says
Virgil Gulker, founder of the nationwide church services network.
   Gulker began the first LOVE INC. program in this southwest
Michigan city in 1981 while working for a church-sponsored
community agency.
   He was frustrated that the vast resources of area churches,
mainly their volunteers, were not being tapped to help meet the
community's needs.
   Gulker saw the waste created by agencies and private
organizations that duplicated services because they lacked a clear
idea of what others did.
   He was frustrated by the ``holiday food basket syndrome,'' the
tendency by churches to provide groceries at Thanksgiving or a coat
at Christmas, while ignoring deep-seated problems faced daily by
members of the community.
   Guided by the belief that a church's resources, if organized
effectively, could meet almost every need of a community, Gulker
set out to create LOVE INC., local clearinghouses that would keep
inventories of services provided in a community and link those in
need with the agency or group most able to help. Where a need
couldn't be met by an existing group, LOVE INC. would tap the
resources of the church.
   Since its inception, LOVE INC. has expanded to 50 local programs
in 14 states, linking 1,300 churches of 50 denominations and
meeting about 12,000 individual needs each month, Gulker says.
   What sets LOVE INC. apart from other church-sponsored
organizations is that it is strictly a clearinghouse and referral
service. Its volunteers do not provide any direct assistance.
That's left up to the agencies or churches to which the person in
need is referred.
   ``We have a saying here, `We will not knowingly help anyone,'''
Gulker says. ``That sounds awful, but it's the only way a program
like this can work.''
   If a person has a need that a government or private agency is
not equipped to meet, or if the person does not meet specific
eligibility requirements, a participating neighborhood church is
called upon to help.
   One of LOVE INC.'s most important responsibilities, Gulker says,
is to ensure that community services provided are not duplicated.
   ``In one community, clothing was provided so readily and without
a governing policy, that some families stopped doing their
laundry,'' he says. ``When their clothes would get dirty, they'd
throw them out and get more.
   ``Through our failure to communicate, as agencies and church
representatives, we have created that dependency. We have said to
these people, `There's no need to be personally responsible for
your own situation, we will take care of that for you.'''
   To end the chronic dependent's cycle, LOVE INC. encourages
churches to attach ``self-help'' conditions to assistance so the
individual can become self-sufficent.
   For example, a person who continually asks a church to help meet
rent payments would be required to improve budgeting skills _ with
the help of a church volunteer.
   Other self-help conditions include academic or vocational
training, personal counseling, or help with parenting, shopping or
cooking _ all of which are provided by church volunteers.
   All participating churches are asked to survey their volunteers
to find out what type of service each individual can best provide.
A physician may volunteer to help a sick child whose mother doesn't
qualify for emergency medical aid, while an auto mechanic may be
able to donate a few hours to fix the car of a struggling family.
   When someone in need contacts a LOVE INC. office, program
directors first conduct a background check to weed out roving
panhandlers. If the need is legitimate, it is then funneled to the
appropriate government agency or existing help group, such as the
Salvation Army.
   In Diana Huckaba's case, LOVE INC. referred her to a
little-known government program, which provided a new furnace.
   Now, on the days when she is feeling healthy enough, she works
as a volunteer at the local LOVE INC. office.
   ``Since getting involved in the program, the entire community
has reached out to embrace me,'' says Huckaba, who remarried in
December. ``My entire life has changed. LOVE INC. has given me back
my dignity.''
   Gulker says government agencies are best able to deal with
specialized needs, such as spouse abuse or mental illness. But as
federal funds dry up, church assistance becomes essential.
   LOVE INC., which got a boost in November when it entered a
partnership with the international relief agency World Vision,
wants to have at least one program established in each of the
United States within 10 years.
   In Fresno, Calif., more than 2,200 church members from a total
of 50 area churches have volunteered to help with LOVE INC. cases
since the chapter opened two years ago.
   Thirty-three local government agencies also are part of the
chapter's network.
   ``All the agencies have responded very favorably. They feel that
the church is an untapped resource and they're at the breaking
point,'' says program director Larry Waddell.
   He said that of the approximately 400 requests for assistance
that come into the office each month, LOVE INC. can arrange to meet
about 90 percent of those needs, about 40 percent of those through
existing agencies. The rest are handled by church volunteers.
   Kathleen Busse opened a LOVE INC. chapter in the Chicago suburb
of Clarendon Hills about two years ago.
   There are more than 200,000 people in the area served by the
chapter and about 85 requests for assistance come in each month. Of
those, the chapter can successfully refer about 60 cases.
   Sixty-four churches now participate in the program.
   ``I think we've been doing a bang-up job, but we have nothing to
compare it to, really,'' she says. ``There's no precedent for it.''

<HEAD> EDITOR'S NOTE _Some 100,000 northern elephant seals off the</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Pacific coast today are all descendants of a single colony of fewer
than 100 that survived the slaughter of 19th-century hunters.
Perhaps one of the reasons they escaped extinction is an
overwhelming sex drive, which also explains some other
characteristics of these curious mammals whose mating habits are
often bloody affairs.

<DATELINE>ANO NUEVO STATE RESERVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an annual ritual of
sex and violence on the coast of California.
   Once nearly extinct, some 1,800 northern elephant seal cows and
600 to 700 bulls converge to fight, breed and nurse a new
generation of 1,800 pups on the beaches, sand dunes and offshore
island at Ano Nuevo State Reserve, 50 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
   From December to March the reserve is a major rookery in the
elephant seals' habitat, which ranges from off San Francisco to
central Baja California.
   On a typical day, a small elephant seal cow is seen desperately
worming her way across the sand toward the Pacific Ocean, pursued
by EPO3, a two-ton male.
   The 16-foot-long bull, who dominates a harem of some 50 cows,
quickly overtakes the female, ignoring her growls of protest as he
mates.
   Two younger bulls sneaking toward the nearby harem are routed by
EPO3, who rears up and trumpets a belligerent warning. The invaders
do the same, but flee nonetheless.
   Later, two other bulls engage in battle, biting and trumpeting
for 10 minutes. They are drenched with blood as they fight for
access to cows and a chance to pass their characteristics to future
generations.
   ``Sex and violence _ it's the basics of life,'' says Burney Le
Boeuf, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who
has been studying the seals for two decades for the government.
   ``If there's any doubt reproduction is fundamental to all life
processes, how an animal behaves and what it looks like, then go to
Ano Nuevo and look at elephant seals breeding.''
   Le Boeuf believes the seals' need to conserve energy for
reproduction accounts for their ability to fast for 90 days, hold
their breath for up to 48 minutes while under water, and repeatedly
dive to depths of 3,000 feet or more where no other marine mammals
venture, except possibly beaked and sperm whales.
   By diving to such depths, pregnant seal cows slow their
metabolism as they feed on a rich supply of squid, skates, rays and
ratfish, Le Boeuf's studies suggest. They expend minimal energy so
they can be in prime condition to deliver and nurse their pups.
   Only the biggest and fiercest bull seals get to sire offspring.
So natural selection has gradually made the bulls extremely
aggressive and given them tools to scare other bulls: elephant-like
snouts, the ability to trumpet, and body weights three to seven
times that of the cows.
   ``The bigger the male, the better the fighter, and the better
the fighter, the better the lover,'' Le Boeuf says. ``You don't get
to be a good lover (or a father) unless you're a good fighter.''
   The seals' fearless behavior almost caused their demise. They
were easy targets for 19th-century hunters who sought blubber for
tanning, lamp fuel, a machinery lubricant, and for making
margarine, paint, clothing and soap.
   Unlike South America's more abundant southern elephant seals,
northern elephant seals were nearly extinct by 1892, with fewer
than 100 surviving on Isla de Guadelupe, 150 miles off Baja's west
coast.
   All 100,000 northern elephant seals alive today descended from
that colony, which was given Mexican government protection in 1922.
   Male elephant seals reach 16 feet in length and weigh up to
4,000 pounds. Females reach 9 feet and 1,600 pounds. Their life
span is about 14 years for males, 16 to 17 years for females.
   Le Boeuf says male will mate about 10 times a day.
   ``They will try to mate anything _ dead or pregnant females,
other males, even pups,'' he says. ``They're so indiscriminate it's
amazing.
   ``Our most famous seal was Adrian. We estimate he inseminated
over 250 different females in his lifetime. It's a record.''

   Because a dominant male ruthlessly fights and sometimes kills
weaker bulls intruding on his harem, 30 percent to 80 percent of
the males never mate.
   Le Boeuf, a 53-year-old Louisianan, compares the scene to a
sleazy singles bar where ``the female starts the fight, all the
males fight, and she goes off with the winner.''
   ``The females almost always protest,'' says Teri Pate, 22, one
of Le Boeuf's students. ``I get pleasure whenever a female gets a
good bite.''
   Because fight they must to father pups, bulls evolved their
threatening big snouts, shaped like stubby elephant trunks.
   ``It's like antlers on a stag,'' Le Boeuf says.
   On land, the seals hold their breath up to 25 minutes during
naps, which allows the bulls to save energy for fighting and
mating, and the cows to conserve energy for nursing.
   Because the bulls must guard their harems, they fast during the
three-month breeding season, deriving energy and water from
blubber. The cows also fast during the 34 days they spend on land
to deliver their pups and nurse them with some of nature's richest
milk.
   ``A pup goes from about 85 pounds at birth to 300 pounds at
weaning in four weeks,'' Le Boeuf says. ``They've literally been
injected with fat from the mother.'' The cows lose about 40 percent
of their weight during four weeks of nursing.
   As they finish nursing, the cows breed, becoming pregnant again.
Then they swim to sea for 72 days, leaving weaned pups on the beach
to fend for themselves and learn to swim and dive. Five percent to
30 percent of the pups do not survive.
   In his studies, Le Boeuf has glued cylinder-shaped, time-depth
recorders to the backs of 20 females. Each $2,600, battery-operated
recorder contains a pressure sensor, a light-emitting diode and
film to measure the time and depth of each dive.
   The studies showed that pregnant cows spend 85 percent of their
time under water and only a few minutes at the surface between
dives. They dive to an average of 1,300 to 2,100 feet and sometimes
to 3,000 feet, nearly twice as deep as any other seal species. The
pressure, 90 times greater than at the surface, would kill humans.
   Le Boeuf theorizes the seals can stay submerged so long because
they conserve oxygen by slowing their heart rate, lowering
metabolism and temperature, and reducing blood flow to organs like
the liver and kidneys. They also may sleep while diving.
   This allows the seals to escape to depths uninhabited by their
only predator, great white sharks. They eat a rich food supply with
little competition. Weight is gained rapidly to prepare for nursing
the pups they will deliver the next December.
   By weighing cows after they mate and again when they return to
molt, or shed fur, 72 days later, Le Boeuf found each cow gained 2\
pounds daily at sea.
   Le Boeuf, who started out studying hormones and social behavior
in rats and dogs, first watched seals fighting to establish their
pecking order during a visit to Ano Nuevo in 1968.
   He later began weighing seals and studying their blood and
metabolism. He used hydrogen peroxide and hair dye to mark names on
their fur _ names like E.T., FBI, CIA, Yin and Yang _ so he could
follow individuals for their lifetimes.
   Le Boeuf says seals are easy to study because they do everything
in the open and don't fear humans.
   ``We get insights into other animals and our own lives by
studying one animal in depth,'' he says. ``We're all products of
natural selection. The mating strategies humans followed _ our
ancestors before civilization _ were probably not much different
than mating strategies in elephant seals.''

   Tom Smothers, in his familiar deadpan
delivery, says his new show with his brother Dick is just like old
times, ``except that CBS doesn't have a censorship department any
more.''
   Tom is exaggerating, but his point is that much has changed in
the nearly 20 years since CBS fired the Smothers Brothers for their
political impudence.
   They're now back on the air with ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour'' for a spring tryout run on CBS. Comedian Pat Paulsen is back
with them, heaping satiric abuse on his rivals.
   The original Smothers Brothers show in the late 1960s became a
rally against the Vietnam War, where the brothers and their guests
attacked the war in song and satire. It soon turned into open
warfare between the Smothers and CBS, which began censoring entire
segments of the show. They were finally fired on April 3, 1969.
   Although Tom says CBS still has some qualms about
``politicalization,'' apparently few eyebrows are being raised.
   The brothers kid that they could take some of their old
anti-Vietnam routines, write in Nicaragua, and they would still be
relevant.
   ``Nicaragua is just like Vietnam,'' Tom says. ``Big people
beating up on little people.''
   ``The government still doesn't listen to its citizens,'' adds
Dick.
   Although the Smothers Brothers were the darlings of the under-30
set in the 1960s, without their television platform they quickly
faded from sight. ABC gave them a brief summer outing in 1970 and
NBC gave them a try in 1975. But the old sass was gone and there
were few targets for their satire.
   The current young generation hardly knows them, but CBS hopes
this exposure will find them a new audience among the young. Their
appearance last year on `Hollywood Squares'' and commercials for
Magnovox helped keep their faces before the public.
   Tom says their act has changed over the past 20 years.
   ``We can't do what we did 20 years ago,'' says Tom. ``I'm 51,
Dick's 49. We're too old to do the old routine. We can't do the
`Mom liked you best' stuff any more.''
   Dick adds, ``George Burns told us that when he and Gracie Allen
were on radio they were having trouble. Suddenly, George realized
they were doing jokes that were for younger people. They had
matured and they had to do material that was appropriate for their
ages.''
   ``We're in a renaissance right now,'' says Tom. ``The big change
in our act is that we switched the focus to Dick. For the first 10
or 12 years the focus of the act was on Tom. The quality of a
comedy team really depends on the straight man. Look at Laurel and
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Rowan and Martin. Dick carries the
weight onstage. I carry the weight offstage.''
   Dick is the straight man in the act. Tom is the cutup comic, who
usually plays dumb. But away from the stage Tom is the act's mover
and shaker. Dick usually left the business side to him while he
raced automobiles. He says now he's given up racing because of his
eyesight.
   ``I ride horses now,'' he explains. ``The horse has better
eyes.''
   For the first time, too, the brothers live apart. When he
remarried, Dick moved to Virginia's horse country. Tom has a place
in Sonoma County, Calif., where the brothers own a winery. He also
has an apartment in Los Angeles.
   Dick met his new wife, Lorraine, while performing in Richmond.
They have a 9-month-old daughter, Sarah. Dick also has three older
children.
   Tom, who is now single, has a son in college.

<TEXT>
   Amy Irving came to New York from Los Angeles for
only three hours just to see South Africa playwright Athol Fugard.
   The thoughtful, serious actress felt she had to appear in
Fugard's ``The Road to Mecca,'' a three-character play about an
eccentric artist facing the loss of her independence.
   In the drama, an older woman, played by Yvonne Bryceland, is the
object of a dispute. An Afrikaner minister, portrayed by Fugard
himself, wants to put the woman in a nursing home, an action
opposed by a feisty, angry teacher. That was the role Miss Irving
wanted to play.
   The playwright and the actress, who had never met before, talked
about the play and its characters and briefly acted out several
scenes.
   ``I was flying when I left the place,'' Miss Irving said the
other day during a rehearsal break. ``It was a thrilling
experience. Athol has so much energy. By the time I left the
audition, I just said, `So when do we start working?''' She got the
part.
   For ``A Road to Mecca,'' now playing at off-Broadway's Promenade
Theater, its journey to New York wasn't accomplished so quickly.
The play's premiere took place at the Yale Repertory Theater in
Connecticut in 1984. The following year there was a production in
London by the National Theater.
   But a New York production was stymied by casting problems,
particularly over whether Miss Bryceland, a South African, should
be allowed to appear here. Actors Equity felt the role should be
played by an American actress.
   Miss Bryceland finally did appear on an American stage nearly a
year ago when ``The Road to Mecca'' was mounted at the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C. Miss Irving was in none of
those productions.
   ``That was part of the appeal to me, the challenge,'' she says.
``Working in a three-character play in a situation where the others
have pretty much found their characters.''
   But she discovered during rehearsals that there were very few
moments when she was aware that Fugard and Miss Bryceland had done
the play before.
   ``That's because they have a new set to work on and there's
completely different blocking,'' Miss Irving says. ``So it is new
for them as well, and besides, they are always finding new values
in the play.''
   The actress also had the pleasure of being directed by the man
who wrote the words.
   ``It's easier being directed by the author because so often
you're not quite sure what the writer meant,'' she says. ``With
this production, you can just turn to the director and say, `What
did the writer mean?' Sometimes he'll remember and sometimes he
won't. And sometimes he'll remember but be open to other
intrepretations.''
   Miss Irving, wife of filmmaker Steven Spielberg, has been able
to move easily between the very different worlds of television,
movies and theater. Filmgoers remember her best as the spiteful
high school student in ``Carrie'' or as the love interest in
Barbara Streisand's ``Yentel.''
   ``It's nice being able to alternate,'' she says. ``After I
finished being a location wife for a while, I went to the
Williamstown Theater Festival and did `Three Sisters' and then went
right into a movie called ``Crossing Delancey' and then this.''
   The theater is Miss Irving's mainstay and she has impeccable and
lengthy stage credentials. She has been in the theater since she
was 9 months old, carried on stage by her mother, actress Priscilla
Pointer. It was a production of ``Rumpelstiltskin'' at the San
Francisco Actors Workshop, a group started by her father, Jules
Irving, in 1954.
   Irving then became artistic director at the Lincoln Center
Repertory Theater in New York. Theater inundated Miss Irving's life
and the lives of her brother and sister. She knew she would have to
make it her profession but was unsure what her parents would say.
   ``After they saw me in my first off-Broadway production, they
breathed a sigh of relief and encouraged me,'' Miss Irving says.
``But they also said, `Just because you've been in theater all your
life, doesn't mean you know everything about it.' They encouraged
me to get classical training.''
   A year at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and
three years studying in London provided the foundation.
   ``My parents taught me a great respect for the theater,'' Miss
Irving says. ``You don't just go and do it. You learn your craft
first, such as the exploration of the text and your responsibility
to the other people on stage.''
   That's what she's doing at the time of the interview, getting
ready for the opening of ``The Road to Mecca'' and putting on stage
what Fugard the playwright and Fugard the director wants.
   ``I haven't got a clue how this comes across to an audience,''
she says. ``I have talked to several people who have seen the play,
including my mother, and they were very excited by it. I hope
they're right.''

<DATELINE>VILLA TUNARI, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roadside spotlights flashed on as
the 10-year-old truck, loaded with foodstuffs and silent peasants,
rumbled down a dirt highway in the midnight darkness near this
jungle crossroads.
   From behind the blinding beams stepped four U.S. Border Patrol
agents and a group of Bolivian police. They stopped the truck,
inspected it and found beneath bundles of food a costly cache of
sulfuric acid, which is used to make cocaine paste.
   Once unheard-of, such spot checks are becoming more and more
common in the Chapare, a semi-tropical lowland region where 90
percent of Bolivia's huge coca crop is produced.
   Helping direct the effort are the four U.S. agents, who
volunteered to transfer from the U.S.-Mexican frontier to train
Bolivian police officers in drug interdiction.
   Before their arrival in October cocaine traffickers controlled
the roads around Villa Tunari, about 60 miles northeast of the city
of Cochabamba. Now, the drug dealers move warily, sometimes falling
into police traps.
   On March 28, the Bolivian police and the border agents snared
two trucks carrying an estimated $80,000 worth of
cocaine-processing chemicals at Paracti, a control point on the
main road to the Chapare.
   Paracti is the agents' base. They rough it there in a
12-by-9-foot guardhouse filled with supplies, clothing, weapons and
other equipment and an electrical generator.
   There's room only for two bunk beds, so the four agents take
turns sleeping. The guardhouse has no running water.
   Nevertheless, Darryl Brown, a bearded 40-year-old Californian,
said he would volunteer for a second tour when his current
four-month stint ends.
   ``Here we can have an impact,'' he said.
   The work sometimes can be hazardous.
   One February night, Brown was among a force of Border Patrol
officers, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents and
Bolivian police who took over a stretch of jungle road used as a
landing strip by traffickers. At dawn when a small plane landed and
inside the group found 963 pounds of cocaine paste.
   The pilot offered them $50,000 to let him fly on with his cargo.
A hostile crowd of hundreds of farmers and peasants, many of whom
are employed in cocaine-paste production, gathered.
   A woman stepped forward with bundles of U.S. dollars to offer as
a bribe but was arrested. The crowd then started throwing rocks and
sticks of dynamite at the officers. Barricades of burning tires and
lumber were thrown up, trapping the officers until reinforcements
could arrive and disperse the mob with gunfire.
   Brown suffered a cut on his cheek; two of the protesters were
killed.
   The agents are part of a 60-man U.S. force trying to help stem
drug production in Bolivia. About 30 U.S. Army Special Forces
members are training a special Bolivian police anti-drug unit,
called The Leopards, and 25 to 30 DEA agents help coordinate in
cocaine interdiction. The U.S. Army has thrown six Huey helicopters
into the effort.
   ``We want to make it so expensive to produce cocaine that it is
no longer cost effective,'' said one DEA agent, who asked not to be
identified. ``Bolivia has the potential, and probably is the most
successful program in South America.''
   The efforts in the Chapare, which is about the size of New
Jersey, has made it difficult for cultivators to sell their
harvested coca leaves to drug processors, according to Col. Nicolas
Anaya Camacho, the regional Leopard commander.
   A 100-pound sack of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine,
sells for $25 to $30. It sold for $200 three years ago. In July
1986, when 170 U.S. troops flew in to assist in a special two-month
operation, the price plunged from $125 to $40, which is about what
it cost to grow the crop.
   With prices sinking below the cost of production, many coca
farmers are joining a government program to eradicate coca acreage.
About 3,400 acres of coca have been voluntarily destroyed by
farmers, who receive $2,000 for each 2.5 acres eradicated.
   The money is intended for crop substitution. The United States
contributes $350 of the total, and the rest comes from the Bolivian
government.
   The U.S. government has earmarked $33 million a year for crop
substitution and development programs, according to the U.S.
Embassy in La Paz. But coca farmers, and many Bolivian officials,
say more is needed.
   ``We need at least $300 million over a three-year period to
combat the cocaine industry effectively,'' Foreign Minister
Guillermo Bedregal said recently. ``We are at war with the cocaine
mafia, and if we don't defeat them, forget democracy and be
prepared for the violence found in Peru and Colombia.''

<HEAD>Democrats Divided Over Israeli Handling of Palestinian Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. is seeking to establish
his differences with the Middle East policies of Democratic
presidential rivals Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis in the weeks
before the crucial New York primary.
   Nowhere does the issue of U.S. policy toward Israel and the
Middle East loom larger than in New York, where Jews cast 22
percent of the votes in 1984. The state holds its presidential
primaries April 19.
   Many Jews remain wary of Jackson, who on a 1979 trip to the
Middle East embraced Palestinian Liberation Organization leader
Yassar Arafat and called Israel a ``state of oppressors.'' He also
described the PLO as ``not merely a terrorist organization, even
though it has engaged in some terrorist acts. It is a government in
exile.''
   Jackson's relations with the Jewish community were further
exacerbated in 1984 when he called New York ``Hymietown.''
   Gore, of Tennesse, has said he was ``dismayed by (Jackson's)
embrace of Arafat and Castro,'' and that he has profound
differences with Jackson on Middle East issues.
   Gore also criticized Dukakis for endorsing a letter that 30 U.S.
senators sent to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir criticizing
Shamir's opposition to an exchange of occupied land for recognition
by Arab states. He said Shamir's objections to Secretary of State
George Shultz's peace plan deserved more consideration.
   The Associated Press asked the presidential candidates to spell
out their proposals for dealing with the Palestinian unrest,
including who should control a new homeland and how they would
protect Israel.
   Every candidate except Jackson specifically mentioned United
Nations Resolutions 242 and 338, which establish the right to exist
of all the states in the Middle East, as the basis for a settlement.
   Here is what the Democrats said:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JESSE JACKSON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The current unrest is founded on a Middle East policy that is
fatally flawed. ... (It) has left Israel with false security and
Palestinians with no security _ and the United States helpless.''
   ``We need an alternative policy in the Middle East which moves
the process that began at Camp David to the next progressive step.
... Mutual recognition is the key to security in the Middle East
for Israel and for our other allies.''
   ``This policy should be built on several principles: the right
of Israel to exist; the right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination, including an independent homeland; the right of
Lebanon to sovereignity and freedom from imposed partition;
normalized ties between the U.S. and all Middle East nations ...
and demilitarization of the region and increased humanitarian aid.''
   ``An international conference on the Middle East, involving all
the parties concerned, including the chosen representatives of the
Palestinian people, will be a giant step towards peace.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALBERT GORE JR.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The issue is both the Palestinian people and the Israeli
people. There cannot be a solution for one and not the other. I
believe that U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 must be the basis for a
settlement. This means a willingness on the part of Israel to
exchange land for peace. It also means a firm and unequivocable
commitment on the part of the Palestinians and the Arab states to
live up to peace-for-land. ...
   ``Our role is to facilitate the peace process but not to dictate
the terms of a peace settlement. The final status of the
territories is a matter to be decided through direct negotiatons
between the parties themselves. But I will say that my
administration will not recognize the PLO, or negotiate with it,
until and unless it fully and credibly accepts U.N. Resolutions 242
and 338, eliminates its call for the destruction of the state of
Israel and ends its support of terrorism.
   ``In the Gore administration no one will ever have reason to
doubt the American commitment to the survival and security of the
state of Israel. ... I will continue to supply Israel with the
military aid necessary to deter its enemies.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The Israeli authorities have a legitimate right to restore
order in response to violent demonstrations and attacks on Israeli
security forces. But it is clear that in several instances military
personnel have used excessive force. ...
   ``There is an urgent need to get the peace process moving again.
Tragedy has produced a unique opportunity to begin the first steps
toward resolving the future of the territories. ...
   ``Direct negotiations between the parties are necessary to
determine the ultimate status of the territories; a solution cannot
be imposed on the region. The negotiations must be based on the
principles of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which include
recognition of Israel's right to exist within secure borders, and,
must also in the words of Camp David, recognize the `legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people and their just requirements.'''

<HEAD>PAUL SIMON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Until very recently, the Reagan administration sat by
passively and did not pursue a Middle East peace accord. We have to
show that the United States is willing to play an active and
involved role in getting the parties together. Palestinians who
favor Israel's right to exist in peace, who accept U.N. Resolutions
242 and 338, should be welcomed into the process. As president, I
will make face-to-face, direct negotiations between Israelis and
Arabs a top priority.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Among the Republicans:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Bush campaign did not submit a written reply to the AP
questions. But Stephen Hart, press secretary for Bush, said, ``The
vice president is fully in support of Secretary Shultz's peace
plan, which is built upon the Reagan peace iniatives and in which
is embodied U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338. We believe the process
has to result in direct talks between Israel and the
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.''
   The question of who should control a new territory ``is
something that would have to be determined as a result of the
negotiatons,'' said Hart. ``He would continue to protect Israel and
support Israel. ... He believes the peace process has to take into
account the aspirations of the Palestinian people, and at the same
time has to ensure the security of the state of Israel.''
   Bush, in response to a questionnaire that the American Jewish
Committee put out two months ago, said, ``My commitment to Israel's
security is unshakable.'' He added, ``I reject the possibility of
dealing with the PLO until it renounces terrorism and violence and
accepts U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PAT ROBERTSON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``I strongly support a Middle East settlement that would be the
result of direct negotiations between the nations of Israel, the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and the legitimate representatives of
the Palestinian people who would agree to abide by United Nations
Resolutions 242 and 338.
   ``I agree with Prime Minister Shamir that any talks concerning
territorial adjustment should first be preceded by a period of
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank. I reject the concept of
trading territory for peace. ... I do not believe that there will
be lasting peace in the Middle East until Iran, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan and other Arab nations cease belligerency toward
Israel and acknowledge the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign
state in the Middle East.
   ``Given the current climate of hostility against Israel on the
part of her Arab neighbors, any surrender of territory in the near
future would seriously imperil the ability of Israel to defend
herself.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Bright Lights, Big City''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Jay McInerney's novel of redemption in the fast lane of the
1980s is a slim, ultra-hip volume set in the dimly-lighted
discotheques and cocaine-dusted bathroom stalls of New York City.
   The film by James Bridges, equally slender, is so true to the
book it seems that McInerney, who adapted it for the screen, could
have handed in a copy of the novel in lieu of the final draft of
the script.
   But what might have been a pedestrian exercise in book
illustration is, in the hands of Bridges, a simple, artistically
told story that illuminates the spiritual themes in McInerney's
novel instead of trivializing them.
   The movie could as easily have been nothing more than a star
vehicle for Michael J. Fox, a dubious choice to play the narrator
(called Jamie in the film), but he nevertheless takes a pretty good
shot at his most demanding movie role. He could have just come off
as Alex Keaton on an all-night binge in the Big Apple.
   As we meet Jamie, an aspiring writer toiling as a fact checker
at stodgy Gotham magazine, he has recently been abandoned by
Amanda, his ambitious, vacuous fashion-model wife. Haunted by
visions of the mother who abandoned him by dying, he loses himself
in shallow temptations of the flesh provided by Tad Allagash, his
world-class bar-crawler best friend.
   Keifer Sutherland simply is Allagash. Phoebe Cates is blinking
perfection as Amanda, who is more an idea than a character in the
movie as in the book. Tracy Pollan plays Tad's down-to-earth cousin
who represents Jamie's salvation.
   Jason Robards steals scenes as an alcoholic has-been editor at
Jamie's magazine. His son, Sam, has a small part as a club-goer.
Swoosie Kurtz is the good-hearted co-worker who tries to help
Jamie, but has her own agenda, and Frances Sternhagen as Clara,
Jamie's boss, turns the villainess of the book into a palpable
visage of authoritarian disapproval, even while welling up with
tears when forced to fire Jamie for incompetence.
   Dianne Wiest, as Jamie's beloved, dying mother, is swathed in an
almost Christ-like glow for her brief but pivotal role. In
flashback on her death bed, she earnestly asks him what it's like
being a young man _ Does he sleep with many girls? Does he like it?
Is it fun? Since the entire story turns on the believability of
their love for each other, these moments are especially demanding
on actors and director, and they work wonderfully.
   The movie starts just like the book and ends just like the book
and contains much of the dialogue exactly as in the novel. Bridges
has gone with an odd, literal translation of a dream scene inspired
by Jamie's obsession with the blaring tabloid-headline story of a
``coma baby'' imperiled inside its dying mother's womb.
   In the book, Jamie dreams of talking with ``coma baby'' through
its mother's transparent belly. The scene is rendered unto ``E.T.''
in the movie by way of special effects, which is OK since it is a
dream, after all. Otherwise, Bridges' direction is unobtrusive and
often quite lovely. Many of the shots _ Gordon Willis was the
cinematographer _ would stand alone as photographs.
   Those who have read the book will leave ``Bright Lights, Big
City'' satisfied. Those who haven't will have to work a little
harder to see beneath the surface.
   ``Bright Lights, Big City'' went through several writers and a
director before producers Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg
reverted to the basics of the book and put Bridges (``Urban
Cowboy,'' ``China Syndrome'') on the job, under severe time
constraints because of Fox's TV schedule. Despite those problems,
the movie is a nice piece of work.
   Rated R for language and drug use.

   Michael Murray and the Organ of the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine (Telarc)
   
   Michael Murray's program is designed to show off some of the
special qualities of the organ of the Episcopal Cathedral of St.
John the Divine in New York City, one of the world's largest
churches. The organ is likewise immense, with 143 ranks of pipes,
and Murray gives pride of place to some of the solo stops for which
organ builder E.M. Skinner was famous.
   Where else, but perhaps in this recording of ``The Emperor's
Fanfare'' by Padre Antonio Soler, will your hear a tuba major, a
cornopean and an ophicleide in full cry?
   The cathedral's distinctive herald trumpet, mounted under the
west rose window a good 500 feet from the rest of the organ, is
also shown off in John Dunstable's ``Agincourt Hymn'' and Henry
Purcell's ``Trumpet Tune.''
   Still, the recording can only hint at the feeling of being
within that enormous unfinished space, 200 feet wide and 12 stories
high.

   ``Pontiac'' (MCA) _ Lyle Lovett
   
   With a bone dry sense of humor and a touch of classy 1940s
swing, Lyle Lovett is molding country music into his own personal
expression of wit, love, cynicism and occasional touching despair.
   ``Pontiac,'' his second album, establishes Lovett as an
important country and western crossover artist.
   An East Texas boy who relocated to Nashville, his influences are
more Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark than Jimmie Rodgers and Hank
Williams. And with his sharply chiseled face, pencil-thin suit and
rooster-combed hair, he looks more like a caricature from a Deco
design than a country-western singer. But he can kick you-know-what
with the best of 'em.
   Hear the echoes of Bob Willis in ``Give Back My Heart'' _ ``I
said oooh, give back my heart, you kicker-redneck woman, take your
boots and walk out of my life.'' Yee-hah!
   Then he turns around on the title track, a somber ballad Lovett
fantasized about an old man in Austin who parked his Pontiac in the
same spot each day: ``And the girl there across the street, she
sits on her front porch swing. She never realized what I told her
with my eyes, how back in the second war I killed 20 German boys
with my own bare hands.''
   The album opens with ``If I Had a Boat,'' wherein Lovett
combines fantasies about being a cowboy and a sea captain. On this
cut, his creamy smooth voice is most reminiscent of Jesse
Winchester.
   Like Winchester, much of Lovett's material is whimsical. At a
recent appearance at the Bottom Line in New York, he felt obliged
to note at the outset, ``I'm only kiddin'.''
   Take ``She's No Lady (She's My Wife)'' _ please! ``I can't
remember how I met her. Seems like she's always just been hangin'
here off my right arm.''
   He's not kidding, though, about the three-piece horn section,
backup singers and cello that now accompany him.
   Lovett notes wryly that he seems to write a lot of songs about
marriage, even though he's never been. But one of these is the most
stunning cut on the album, ``L.A. County,'' which manages to be a
haunting ballad set to a quick Texas two-step.
   Lovett said he had attended the wedding of a friend and thought
``the sensitive thing to do was to write a song about it.'' What a
sensitive boy: ``And they kissed each other, and they turned
around, and they saw me standing in the aisle. Well I did not say
much. I just stood there watching, as that .45 told them
good-bye.'' Yes, in the song at least, he shoots them.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Alan Alda Fights With Himself and Wins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan Alda, the star of ``A New Life,''
recently talked about a dispute between the film's director and
writer during the closing days of shooting the Paramount film.
   The exchange went something like this:
   Director (after cutting a scene in half, then half again): ``You
don't need it. Get rid of it. It's holding the picture up.''
   Writer: ``Are you crazy? That's got information the audience
must know to understand these characters.''
   Director: ``Then send them a telegram. Don't waste my time with
this scene.''
   Writer: ``There are two good jokes in there. I'm not wasting the
audience's time.''
   Both figures, of course, were Alan Alda, and he reports happily
that the writer won the argument. Why did that please him?
``Because I think I identify more closely with the writer,'' he
said.
   Performing three functions on a big-budget movie would seem to
risk a severely split personality. Not Alda. He remains one of the
most stable of show business personalities. Like his character
Hawkeye Pierce of TV's ``M-A-S-H,'' he seems able to face any
situation with a sanity insulated with sly humor.
   ``A New Life,'' which drew a mixed reaction from critics,
concerns life after the divorce of long-married Alda and
Ann-Margret. He explores the swinging single scene with his
hedonist pal, Hal Linden, while she returns to school to become a
teacher. The script resulted from long research by Alda.
   ``I talked to a lot of people who had been through divorce,
maybe a couple dozen, also to professionals who had talked to
dozens of people who had been going through similar
circumstances,'' he said. ``I discovered that many of my
preconceptions had been wrong.
   ``Some people I had known for years started telling me things
they had never told me before. Intimate details of their lives.
Neither of us was embarrassed because we both knew I was just
trying to get at the truth for this screenplay.''
   In the film Alda ends up with a new partner, while Ann-Margret
does not. Alda, a longtime feminist, denies any suggestion of a
double standard: ``For her, she winds up with something that at
that particular time in her life is more important: the feeling of
being free and knowing that she's in control of her own life.''
   Co-star Ann-Margret has long been noted for her sex-charged
roles. Alda paints a different picture: ``She's so sweet, so shy
and unassuming, I always had to ask her to talk up. She talks in
such a quiet voice; she never wants to intrude on anybody. Yet she
has what the character needs: an inner strength. She is a strong
woman who has been through a lot of reversals.''
   Alda's life appears to be remarkably free of reversals. He was
born into the theatrical world, the son of Robert Alda, who played
George Gershwin in the 1945 film ``Rhapsody in Blue.'' Alan got his
first exposure to show business by accompanying his father on the
burlesque circuit. At 16 he made his stage debut in a Pennsylvania
summer theater, where he appeared in ``White Cargo'' with the
stripper Rose La Rose.
   By the time he was 26, Alda was married and the father of three
daughters and making a fair living in the New York theater as well
as occasional films. After starring in ``The Owl and the Pussycat''
and ``The Apple Tree,'' he was lured by the pilot script of a TV
series about the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in the Korean War.
``M-A-S-H'' proved to be an 11-year triumph.
   His images of the series?
   ``The first image that always comes into my mind is that dark
cavern of a sound stage that we would lock ourselves into at 8
o'clock in the morning or even before it got light,'' he said.
``And we wouldn't leave until 8 o'clock at night after it was dark.
We never saw daylight for six months of the year.
   ``The second image is the fun we had there. The laughing, the
excitement of finding a scene, of making something work and keeping
after it until it did work. I don't know of any other television
show that routinely did 20 takes to make something work.''
   Is there a danger of Hawkeye overwhelming his career?
   ``I don't think so. I don't think I've seen signs of it, but I
don't know.
   ``This whole thing _ the career, acting, doing the work, then
reading about it and finding out where you stand _ it's all like
riding a horse: You're just hurtling along at what seems like 100
miles an hour; you pass people on the sidelines who are shouting at
you but you can't understand it; you're just hoping you don't fall
off.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Exhibit Traces Black Migration To The North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With little more than a ``big mouth and a
prayer,'' 17-year-old Estelle Williams left her rural Alabama home
more than a half-century ago and headed north to Pittsburgh with
the idea that life would be better for an ambitious young woman
with big plans.
   ``I was never happy in the South. I was never happy with life
for blacks there,'' she said. ``I wanted better things and I saw no
way of getting them in the South.''
   Mrs. Williams, now 71, was one of nearly a million blacks who
left the South between 1915 and 1940 in hope of finding a better
life in the North.
   The human aspects of the ``Great Migration'' are examined in a
traveling exhibit called ``Field to Factory: Afro-American
Migration, 1915-1940.''
   A Ku Klux Klan membership card, the photograph of a ``hanging
tree'' used in lynchings and tools blacks used while working in the
industrial North are among the items included in the exhibit. It is
a smaller version of one already in place at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington.
   Documents, letters to relatives, photographs and other items
from that period are on a two-year national tour that began at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and ends at the South
Carolina State Museum in Columbia, S.C., in August 1990, said
Spencer Crew, a museum family-life curator who spearheaded both
projects.
   Other stops are scheduled in Jacksonville, Fla.; Yonkers, N.Y.;
Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.; and Columbus, Ohio.
   ``Whether you're black or white, moving is something a lot of
people have done,'' Crew said. ``Many people have relatives who
left rural areas and moved to Northern cities, or immigrants who
moved from other countries to this country.''
   Mrs. Williams began planning her move when she was in grade
school. She was inspired by an aunt from Pittsburgh who frequently
visited her Southern relatives, telling them about life in
Pennsylvania.
   ``I was more or less a rebellious young lady,'' she said ``My
mother worked in white people's houses on farms and she tried to
make we work on the farm, but I refused. I told her I'd stay inside
the house _ I'd wash, iron, cook or anything, but I wasn't born to
work in the fields.''
   After contributing to her family's support, she saved the rest
of the 50 cents she weekly earned cooking and cleaning in the homes
of whites. Eventually, she had enough for one-way train fare to
Pittsburgh.
   When she arrived she quickly realized her vision of the North as
a land of limitless opportunity wasn't accurate.
   Racism existed in Pennsylvania also, she said, and living and
working conditions in the big city weren't much better. Sometimes
they were worse.
   ``When I saw where my aunt lived _ she had one little room and
the use of a kitchen _ I nearly died,'' she said.
   In her hometown of Clayton, Ala., ``at least we had a big barn
to stay in. But I told myself, `I made this big brag that I was
going to Pittsburgh, so I'm not going back.'''
   In the following 54 years, Mrs. Williams raised two children and
a niece, survived an unhappy marriage, bought a home, saved enough
money to bring her mother, a brother and two sisters out of Alabama
and helped unionize fellow seamstresses in a wholesale carpeting
business.
   Blacks began leaving the South in large numbers for a variety of
reasons, according to Joe Trotter, a Carnegie Mellon professor of
history. Boll weevil infestation and flooding ravaged cotton crops
at that time, limiting the number of farm jobs available for
blacks, while restrictions on immigration during World War I
increased the number of jobs in industrial Northern states.
   Blacks could not vote in the South, and many sought greater
control over their lives in the North, Trotter said.
   ``Lynching was a real factor for some people. It was the whole
idea that life was precarious in the South,'' he said.
   The migration also marked an important turning point in black
history, he said.
   ``Previously, movement often was into rural areas. Migration
into urban industrial areas was something new. In fact, it
reorganized the black community and created a national black
community. Before it was pretty much a regional, Southern
community,'' Trotter said.
   It took about a year to collect materials for the exhibits. Some
personal items were lent to the museum by people who made the
change from rural to city life, Crew said.
   The larger exhibit in Washington includes a farm house from
southern Maryland, a re-creation of the interior of a segregated
train car and the inside of a Philadelphia row house.
   ``I gave talks for about a year to people, telling them what we
were trying to do,'' Crew said. ``It made a lot of people look back
and see that this was not a singular experience for their relatives
_ it was part of a larger story and it fits into a broader
experience.
   ``It also reminded people of the importance of saving everyday
artifacts to tell the story of the American people.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Meli'sa Morgan Runs Her Own Show</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Meli'sa Morgan has taken control of her own
show, but she would be the first to say that she's not a one-woman
band.
   On her debut, ``Do Me Baby,'' she co-wrote and co-produced most
of the material. She did the same on five songs on her new album,
``Good Love''; two singles from the album _ ``Love Changes,'' her
duet with Kashif, and ``If You Can Do It: I Can Too'' _ are
climbing the charts.
   Still, she says, ``I feel there are a lot of things around me
that I do handle and I have control over certain situations, but
I'm not in total control because I can't do it alone.''
   By co-writing and co-producing, Morgan feels she has ``more
control over my creativity which is important in establishing a new
artist and getting your sound across.
   ``If someone is controlling your creativity then you feel
limited and you're not letting all that you can be come out,''
Morgan said.
   The result, ``Good Love,'' is a little more romantic than her
last LP, which turned out the hits ``Do You Still Love Me'' and
``Do Me Baby.''
   ``I feel on this album, whether I told a sad story or a happy
story, it was just more romantic,'' she said.
   ``On the last album I was definitely more rebellious as a
writer, not only professionally but just in the struggle of being
in this business _ trying to get a deal and get people to listen to
me. Now I don't think I'm as hungry as I am anxious. I'm anxious to
get to that next level to prove that I can handle that, too.''
   Inspiration came to the performer _ born Joyce Meli'sa Morgan _
at a very young age. As the youngest of three brothers and a
sister, she enjoyed singing along to the tunes on the stereo in her
mother's living room in Queens.
   At age 9, she started singing with a gospel community choir, the
Starlettes of Corona. The choir broke up when she was 13.
   ``Right then and there, I realized I could either hang out with
the girls and party every weekend or I could start auditioning for
bands. So that's what I decided to do,'' Morgan said.
   She sang with local bands until her high school graduation at
age 16. Then she took on secretarial jobs during the day, sang at
night in small Manhattan clubs and studied music theory at the
Juilliard School of Music in New York.
   In 1983, Miss Morgan toured with Chaka Khan. She began to work
with Kashif, singing on his albums and those of Whitney Houston and
Melba Moore, which he produced, and signed with the same management
company that had signed Kashif, Hush Productions.
   She also began her continuing partnership with
keyboardist-composer Lesette Wilson. Hush Productions had
established writers but Morgan thought that she and Wilson could
write better songs.
   ``You're always a bit skeptical when there's some one brand new
and you don't know what she can do,'' said Wayne Edwards, a Capital
Records vice president. ``She was signed through Hush Productions,
and Hush was confident in her abilities. If they feel that
confident, we said, let's take a shot.''
   ``Because Lesette has had some experience already producing _
and our stuff (songs) was better _ that's how I got to write the
majority of the material on my first album,'' Morgan said.
   ``After the success of the first album, it was natural that I
write again for this one.''
   ``What surprised me was the fact that she could be in such
control of her career at such an early age and have such a defined
direction,'' Edwards said. ``She walked in prepared. I knew we had
the goods.''
   Now she's enjoying the fruits of her labor. For the first time,
when she goes out on tour, she will be the headliner.
   ``I think I've had a lot of success and I'm very thankful for
that, but I think that there's just so much more. I'm just anxious
to get there. Sometimes I just have to lay back and be cool,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Special Blend Keeps ``Hee Haw'' Alive For 20
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRETT J. BLACKLEDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUTHRIE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   There's a special blend as potent as
Tennessee moonshine that's responsible for the 20-year success of
the syndicated country variety show ``Hee Haw.''
   The Nashville-produced program, ridiculed by national TV critics
after its first broadcast, has survived cancellation by CBS, the
loss of major cast members and the general decline of network
variety shows.
   In fact, ``Hee Haw'' has outlasted every other variety show in
television history, surpassing ``The Lawrence Welk Show'' in
September with more than 1 billion viewers in two decades.
   Cast members who were with the show in the days when it was
taped in a one-room Nashville news studio say it has exceeded all
expectations because of its down-home, country hospitality.
   ``I don't think the public cares if we do the same thing over
and over again,'' said Minnie Pearl, an original cast member. ``I
think they're more interested in visiting with us.''
   ``The audience knows we like them,'' said George Lindsey, a
16-year ``Hee Haw'' veteran who brought his popular ``Goober''
character to the show when ``Mayberry R.F.D'' was canceled. ``They
know that we're their friends. I think they're almost doing it with
us.''
   Lindsey and Miss Pearl are featured with other cast members and
fellow country music entertainers in a special two-hour 20th
anniversary tribute to the series to be broadcast between April 15
and May 8.
   Other cast members appearing on the special include Cathy Baker,
Marianne Rogers, Misty Rowe, Grandpa Jones, Gailard Sartain, Gordie
Tapp, Dub Taylor and Buck Owens, who left the show two years ago
after 18 years as co-host.
   Featured guests include George Jones, Conway Twitty, Barbara
Mandrell, Kathy Mattea, Charley Pride, Kenny Rogers, Ricky Skaggs
and Highway 101.
   The special, taped before a live audience March 30 at the Lazy E
Arena in Guthrie, gave original cast members and fellow country
music artists a chance to catch up on each other's lives.
   ``It's really like a family reunion,'' said Roy Clark, who has
served as co-host of the show since its first broadcast. ``We see
how fat everybody's gotten and how many new babies there are.''
   During rehearsals for the show, Tanya Tucker, who first appeared
on the program at age 14, got autographs from performers and cast
members. Lorretta Lynn, who was featured on the first ``Hee Haw,''
had pictures taken with many fellow artists. And Clark spent much
of his time between stage calls exchanging stories with guests and
cast members.
   Sam Lovullo, the program's producer since its pilot in 1969,
believes there's a simple reason ``Hee Haw'' has been successful:
``The people on the show make it fun. It's got a little bit of
everything for everybody in the audience.''
   There were no formalities and no tempers lost when taping the
anniversary special, despite the complexity of weaving 15 major
country music acts into the program's basic format of hillbilly
humor.
   Clark found time between sketches to rattle off jokes to the
live audience or to coerce the band into joining him in a song to
pass the time; Minnie Pearl rushed to kiss a man in the audience
after he complimented her performance in a sketch; and Ray Stevens
cast off problems with his song by stopping in mid-verse with a
joke.
   The concept for ``Hee Haw'' was developed by Canadians John
Aylesworth and Frank Peppiatt, who offered the series to CBS when
their ``Jonathan Winters Show'' was canceled in 1968.
   CBS asked for a 12-week pilot of the show to air in the summer
of 1969, and incorporated it in its regular season lineup in 1970.
But the network canceled ``Hee Haw'' and several other top-rated
country-oriented programs in 1971 to make room for shows aimed at a
younger, urban audience.
   Six months later ``Hee Haw'' went into syndication, and its 26
shows a year are now carried by 220 stations, 135 of which are CBS
affiliates.
   Aylesworth and Peppiatt developed the show's concept after
noting the success of ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In'' and realizing
the potential for a variety show spotlighting country music and
comedy.
   ``We figured it had a pretty good chance,'' said Aylesworth, who
left the show in 1981 after a subsidiary of Oklahoma City-based
Gaylord Broadcasting Co. acquired the program's original production
company. ``We just put it together, just shooting from the hip.''
   That carefree and casual style has been the show's trademark.
It's not unusual to see foiled comedy sketches in the weekly
broadcast. In fact, much of the 20 minutes of old footage included
in the anniversary special features on-air blunders that have been
praised by fans as some of the show's funniest material.
   ``That's the thing that has kept this show on for 20 years,''
said Barry Adelman, a writer for the show for 10 years. ``Comedy
has made the difference. A lot of other country music shows started
at the same time `Hee Haw' did. But `Hee Haw' is the only one
left.''
   ``You've got to admit, it's got to be the most different and
unusual show on television,'' said Owens, who teamed up with Clark
in several sketches for the special.
   ``A bunch of fat, old men and pretty, young girls _ that's what
it's all about.''

   Introducing youngsters to the marvels of plant life is one of
the educational benefits of a children's garden, which also
stimulates a sense of wonder and a respect for living things.
   That's the view of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where for 74
years more than 15,000 children have cultivated the same patch of
city land in the world's oldest continuous program of its kind.
   ``The success of the crops is only one of the rewards the
children reap,'' says Betsy Jacobs, the garden's associate director
of education, children's programs. ``Of equal importance are the
lessons they learn _ self-discipline, first-hand experience,
dignity of labor, generosity, respect for the rights and property
of others, respect for the environment, responsibility, and giving
of one's self.''
   Gardening is an acceptable way for youngsters to get dirt under
their fingernails and learn something valuable they will hold dear
for the rest of their lives. Even the difficult child can respond
with innocent wonderment to the miracle of growing things.
   How do parents or teachers involve youngsters in home gardening?
Here are some suggestions from specialists:
   _ Start small: 5 square feet is a large responsibility for a
child. Begin with seeds, because if you buy plants, your child will
miss out on the cycle of seeds, soil, sun and water. The best way
for a child to learn is by watching, so keep the coaching to a
minimum. Let them watch you for a while before you turn them loose
to plant.
   _ Never water or care for the plants yourself, except when
helping very young children. Don't lay a guilt trip on the child if
flowers or vegetables die of neglect. Say nothing; the child
learned a lesson that may stick.
   _ Put a low wire edging around the child's garden, which may be
a separate area in the home garden or a bit of separate land. The
wire is intended to keep out siblings, household pets and adult
feet. It also gives the child a sense of ownership. Let your young
gardener pull up some flowers if he or she wants to and to make
bouquets in vases or foil-lined cans.
   _ A simple device to help children water plants is a roller
paint tray with holes perforated with a nail. Plant seeds in rows
parallel to the tray about 6 inches away. The tray can be filled
with a small bucket and will act as a reservoir. A water hose in
the hands of a little one tends to wash away seeds and knock over
seedlings _ and soak the child.
   _ Manure water or a weak solution of fertilizer can be used
occasionally to demonstrate that plants can benefit from extra
feedings. Explain what plant foods do for flowers and vegetables.
   _ Let the child be a part of the process of selecting what to
plant, but remember that ease and dependability are big factors.
   It would be difficult to find an easier-to-grow, more dependable
and spectacular plant than annual sunflowers. Children will get a
kick out of growing such enormous plants. The seeds are easy to
handle and quick to sprout. Few insects bother sunflowers. Beans
and summer squash seeds also are easy to handle.
   Climbing vines such as morning glories also make good first
flowers, but you should string these plants up a fence or sturdy
pole. Easy flower varieties include marigolds, zinnias and cosmos.
   Another idea is to buy mixtures of flower seeds ready-made for
children. Some are sold as ``Annual Flower Mixture,'' ``Cutflower
Mixture,'' or ``Wildflower Mixture.'' Any of these can produce
beautiful species and curiosities. These mixtures thrive even if
not thinned much, fed, or watered for a while.
   The idea is to get the child's attention and hold interest with
projects that get quick or spectacular results.
   First show children the dry or ``sleeping'' seeds and how they
``wake up'' when moistened or planted. Line the inside of a clear
glass or jar with seeds a few inches apart. Put a lid on, leave the
jar on a kitchen counter, making sure the towel remains wet. In a
few days, seeds will swell and burst open, roots will grow down
while stems and leaves grow up.

   The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, whose Children's Garden was
initiated in 1914, says it has never produced a satisfactory answer
to ``the radish question,'' explaining:
   ``Every year, there has been a Saturday in late April when
packets of seeds are given to several hundred city children. The
soil is carefully worked and the seeds dropped into rows according
to arrangements meticulously worked out on graph paper during
classroom sessions weeks before.
   ``The first harvest comes in about six weeks. The first harvest,
inevitably, is radishes. The child, never having produced a miracle
before, bears them home in triumph.
   ``Then comes, for a mother, the supreme test of her nurturing
ability. How do you respond to this peculiar prize without
diminishing the young gardener's enthusiasm and self-esteem?
   ``The lettuce and tomatoes are still weeks and months away,
respectively, so you can't make a salad. To fry a radish is out of
the question. A little bit may punch up a casserole, but there's no
way it can be a main ingredient. The child wants everyone to make a
meal of the first crop, which is indeed a miracle given the
circumstances.
   ``What's a mother to do?
   ``It is estimated that each child, on a certain Saturday in
June, takes home an average of 73 radishes. As this has been
happening since 1914, it means that the heroic mothers or Brooklyn
and other New York City boroughs have had as many as 2 million
radishes to deal with.''

   There's no guarantee that you'll break any giant vegetable
growing records _ such as the 671-pound pumpkin and 595.5-pound
squash _ but you can try.
   Here are a few suggestions to help you on your way to fame, fun
and not much fortune.
   The record pumpkin, 12-feet-11-inches in circumference, won top
prizes at 1986 World Pumpkin Confederation Weigh-Offs for Robert
Gancarz, a Jacobstown, N.J., vegetable farmer. The squash was grown
by his brother, Edward.
   The previous record pumpkin, grown in 1984 at Chelan, Wash.,
weighed 612 pounds and the top squash had been 513 pounds.
   At the competition in Collins, N.Y., it took 12 men to move the
giant pumpkins from a forklift to a truck scale. The pumpkins were
so big and heavy that they grew flat on one side and each ridge was
wider than a man's foot.
   The first step in growing a giant vegetable, says a Michigan
State University horticulturist, is to pick a giant variety in
buying seeds. Major seed companies often offer a number of large
varieties.
   When it comes to big vegetables, the secret really is genetic.
If you plant seeds of ordinary-size vegetables, no matter how much
fertilizer, water, sunlight and care you provide, you'll still have
ordinary-size vegetables. But if you plant seed for giants and
provide all those growing aids, you'd better have a lot of growing
and storage space.
   For instance, Atlantic Giant pumpkin seed produces fruit big
enough to hold a person and the variety has weighed in at 495.5
pounds. Big Max seed often produces 100-150 pounders.
   For giant winter squash, try Hungarian Mammoth or Mammoth King,
which may tip the scale at 400 pounds (not unusual at 250 pounds).
An edible huge squash is Pink Banana, 3 feet long and 8 inches in
diameter, weighing 50-60 pounds.
   Give your plants a head start to gain big size by planting the
seeds very early indoors in large containers. You want six-week-old
transplant to put into the garden after the soil warms in spring.
   Prepare the garden area as soon as you can work the soil. A high
spot has better drainage and a longer growing season than a low
place where cold air collects and frost comes early.
   Remember that a giant squash vine will be 30 to 40 feet long, so
plant where it will be out of the way. Give plants about 10 square
feet in which to straggle. Bush-type pumpkins and squash are being
developed.
   After you work the soil, add fertilizer at the rate recommended
for general vegetable gardening and cover with black plastic mulch
to warm the soil. The mulch also helps minimize the shock of
transplanting, discourages weed growth and conserves moisture.
   Set the plants in the ground through slits in the plastic mulch
as early as feasible, being careful not to damage roots. Shield
plants against cold with a hot cap or other covering, removing the
cover in the morning to protect it from the sun's baking heat.
   Pick all female flowers until the vine is about 8 feet long. The
female flowers are those with miniature fruit at the stem end. The
others are male. This will give the vine growth needed to support
big fruit. Let the second or third female flower set fruit and pick
off all other female flowers that follow as soon as they appear.
   Examine the vine and pick flowers at least three times a week.
To keep vines healthy, an insect and disease control program and
weekly watering in dry periods are necessary. Extra fertilizer
isn't necessary unless obvious nutrient problems appear.
   To improve the shape of your giant vegetables, roll the fruit a
quarter of a turn every week or 10 days. You can do this, however,
only while the fruit is small and the stem is not yet woody. After
this, rolling fruit is apt to break it from the vine.
   For maximum size, let your pumpkin, squash, watermelon or other
giant vegetables grow until the vine is dead or at least nearly dry.

   For a shaded spot in the garden, on the patio, window box or
hanging basket, the exquisite tuberous begonia will bring brightly
colored flowers often 5 to 6 inches across.
   Begonia tuberhybrida produces spectacular blooms, just right for
terraces. Drooping or pendulous varieties are known as hanging
basket types but flowers are smaller _ and more numerous.
   Getting a good head start indoors in spring is the secret of
getting a season-long display outdoors.
   The tubers generally are priced according to size but you don't
have to have the biggest tubers to get the best results. Buy firm
tubers. Soft ones indicate rot.
   If sprouting eyes are not visible, put the tubers on a mixture
of peat moss and sand in equal parts and water them. Cover the
tubers with sphagnum peat, moisten it and keep the pot (with one or
two tubers) or the flat in 70-degree temperature. In two weeks or
so, tiny pinkish eyes should appear.
   Plant the tubers, inverted side up, in regular potting soil or a
mix of sand peat or perlite and garden loam (one third each).
Begonias need a well-drained medium and lots of moisture.
   In planting tuberous begonias in individual pots, set the top of
the tuber with the sprouting eyes an inch or two below the surface.
A fairly wide pot is recommended since roots form around the sides
of the tuber and spread outward. Begonias are shallow-rooted so the
pot need not be very deep. A pot 7-8 inches across is adequate for
one tuber.
   For good growth indoors, set pots in a sunny window or
supplement with artificial light 12-16 hours a day. Poor light
means elongated and spindly steams. Because begonias are heavy
feeders, fertilize every two weeks with liquid nutrients at
recommended rates.
   After frost danger ends, set plants outdoors, directly into the
ground or sink their pots in well-drained soil. Avoid soggy
conditions.
   It will be helpful to set stakes, such as 2-foot tall slender
bamboo poles, beside each growing stalk when the plants are set
out. Large flowers will need support. Stalks may break otherwise on
windy or rainy days.
   A light mulch of peat moss on the soil around begonias will
conserve moisture. Feed regularly to encourage good flower
production throughout summer.
   Begonia flowers, red, white, pink yellow or bi-colored picotte
have been called mimics of the plant world because they resemble
roses, camellias and carnations, but are odorless.
   Putting potted plants in wire baskets lined with sphagnum moss
will conserve moisture.
   Lift begonias from the garden or containers before heavy frost
and let them cure in a cool place in perlite or peat or in the same
pot, for replanting next season.

   Soils must do more than provide a home for plant roots. They
must also supply nutrients for growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus
and potasium, plus micronutrients including copper, zinc,
manganese, iron and molybdenum.
   Garden fertilizers thus are a fine investment when you know the
correct elements and quantities to apply.
   In their natural state, soils rarely contain enough nutrients
for the best growth of plants. Generally, it is necessary to
supplement the earth's store of plant nutrients for the most
vigorous lawn, abundant flowers or the greatest yield of tasty and
nutritious vegetables. Plants use large amounts of nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium, so these nutrients are most likely to be
deficient in the soil.
   The best way to know what fertilizer is needed is a soil test.
Your county Cooperative Extension Service can help with this.
   Soil experts advise that it is usually wasteful, perhaps even
harmful, to use the wrong fertilizers. A soil test allows you to
give your plants what they need in the most useful proportions.
   How can you tell the proportion of each element in a fertilizer
from the numbers on the bag? A mixture labeled 5-10-5, for
instance, contains 5 percent total nitrogen, 10 percent available
phosphoric oxide, and 5 percent soluble potash.
   Most ordinary farm fertilizers are granulated or pelleted
material. Some may be available in powdered or concentrated forms.
Powdered types may not be desirable because they are too dusty.
However, fertilizer concentrates in liquid form are readily
available to the plants and can be applied to the foliage if
diluted 100 times by volume with water.
   Organic fertilizers also help. What are they? They are any
biodegradable refuse such as animal manure, compost, leaves, weeds,
straw, sawdust, wood chips, garbage, even paper. While organic
matter is an excellent ingredient, it has a low plant nutrition
content and a large amount is needed to correct a soil nutrient
deficiency.
   Fertilizer application is only one step in effective soil
management. For best growth, lawns, vegetable and ornamentals also
need suitable soil acidity, soil structure and moisture.

   Gardeners know nature is forgiving when their flowers and
vegetables flourish despite their errors. Yet there's one gardening
mistake nature won't forgive: watering plants too little or too
much.
   ``There's nothing more important to plants than water,'' says
gardening authority Dorrie Sillman. ``The main day-to-day problem
facing gardeners is delivering the right amount of water to the
soil.''
   Seeds will not germinate without water, she says. Without it, a
plant's biological processes cease. Water also gives plants their
shape and stiffness. Nutrients must dissolve in water before plants
can use them. At the same time, a plant cannot obtain sufficient
nutrients in waterlogged soil.
   In her garden in Holland, Pa., Miss Sillman tests power tools _
including a tiller, portable sprayer and chipper _ designed to
assist suburban gardeners with their year-round chores.
   ``Irregular, insufficient watering is the biggest mistake,
particularly during hot, dry summer weather,'' she says. ``You must
provide enough water to penetrate the soil to the level of a
plant's roots. Surface water will evaporate in the heat of the
sun.''
   Miss Sillman, who counsels users of Mantis Manufacturing Co.
equipment on planting and maintaining small-plot gardens, offers
these tips:
   _ How to tell if soil requires water: Pick up a handful of
topsoil and squeeze it into a ball. The soil has sufficient
moisture if the ball holds its shape. If the ball crumbles easily,
the soil needs water. Ideally, water when half the moisture the
soil can hold has dried out.
   _ How much water the soil needs: Water should soak into the soil
at least 6 inches to a foot deep to reach plant roots. In general,
this means applying about an inch of water over the entire area of
your garden. The lighter, more sandy your soil, the deeper this
amount of water will penetrate. Mere surface sprinkling encourages
shallow roots which are vulnerable to scorching in the hot sun.
   _ How to water the soil: Early in the season, when plant root
systems have not developed, hand watering will not take much time.
With a hose spray attachment that breaks the force of water, it's
healthier for the delicate plants, too.
   As root systems develop, however, you will need to find a more
efficient way to distribute water.
   Sprinklers attached to hoses or sprinkler hoses (perforated
plastic hoses) will provide a constant even supply of water to your
garden from above the soil. You can place a tin can with a 1-inch
mark from its bottom in the path of a sprinkler to easily tell when
the sprinkler has delivered sufficient water to penetrate the soil
to the right depth.
   _ How often to water: Soil conditions, weather, the kinds of
plants you grow affect the frequency of watering. Vegetables, in
general, need twice as much water as flowers. Newly planted trees
and shrubs require frequent watering, especially in dry weather.
Plants sheltered by walls or hedges may need watering even after a
rainstorm, but they will not dry out as fast as plants in the open.
Plants high on a slope will dry out faster than those at the
bottom. Plants growing in light, sandy soil need water more often
than those growing in heavier soil.
   A good rule of thumb: make sure your garden gets 1 inch of water
per week throughout the growing season.

   A compost pile is a beneficial way to dispose of household
refuse, crop residue and autumn leaves, while producing your own
supply of organic matter for the garden.
   Almost any family can develop a compost pile that also offers
environmental advantages. Starting and maintaining a compost pile
is not complicated. There are special attractive, sophisticated
bins made for this purpose but really all you need is a bottomless
receptacle of boards or chicken wire in which to collect material.
   The size of the bin will depend on the size of your garden, with
an average dimension of about 6-feet-by-6-feet. It can be hidden
behind trees, at the edge of the garden, or near an outbuilding.
   My compost bin is fashioned of heavy wire with six sides which
help support tomato plants that are fed nutrients by the pile's
contents.
   Rather than adding to a community's waste disposal burden,
composted refuse becomes a valuable fertilizer and soil
conditioner. Apply it to the garden at a rate of at least a pailful
to the square yard each year. Mix the compost thoroughly with the
topsoil to a depth of 6 to 10 inches, or apply it as a ulch on the
soil surface.
   A major garden problem is poor soil, not so much the fertility
but the structure. Compacted loam, sandy and clay soils discourage
plant growth even when fertilizer is added. Compacted soils lock up
nutrients; sandy soils leach away, clay soils restrict freedom of
root growth.
   The most effective remedy in such a situation is compost, with
its fibrous structure and pockets of air allowing plant roots
freedom to breathe.
   Compost not only improves soil texture, it adds beneficial
micro-organisms that manufacture plant nutrients and help fight
soil diseases.
   Frequent questions about compost and answers:
   _ Does compost have any value as a fertilizer?
   Yes, if it is made from materials that contain essential plant
nutrients. Animal manures and green wastes such as grass clippings
and green leaves are a source of nitrogen; bone meal and rock
phosphate are a source of phosphorus, and wood ashes (in limited
quantities) are an excellent source of potash. Compost also
conditions the soil, improves the moisture-holding capacity of
sandy soils and breaks up sticky, cold clay soils.
   _ What materials are best for composting?
   From the house: fruit and vegetable peelings, shredded
newspapers, eggshells, coffee grounds, tea bags, wood ashes, cotton
and wool rags. From the garden: grass clippings, hedge trimmings,
weeds, shredded leaves, animal manures, including poultry. Leaves
and fibrous weed roots are best shredded with a lawn mower to speed
decomposition.
   _ How long does it take to make compost?
   That depends on the method used and time of year. Warm
temperatures hasten decomposition. With a compost bin, which
prevents waste materials from drying out or becoming waterlogged,
it's possible to have useful compost within six weeks.
   _ Do compost heaps need turning?
   With an exposed compost pile the sides have a tendency to dry
out and so turning the heap will ensure thorough decomposition.
Turning an exposed heap also aids aeration. With an enclosed bin,
ventilation from below and along the sides provides adequate
aeration without the need for turning. Also, the protection
provided by a bin extends fermentation to all areas of the heap.
   _ Can compost feed lawns?
   Yes, and the time to apply it is in fall. Spread it evenly over
lawn areas and during winter the compost will work its way into the
existing soil. By spring it will be all gone, absorbed into the
upper soil surface helping the grass to grow thick and healthy.

   In most parts of this country, September is a good time to plant
evergreen trees to enhance the landscape _ but which varieties best
suit your purposes?
   First, make up your mind what should be their ultimate height
and general shape. Then study your catalogs or visit your favorite
nursery.
   If you want a large tree, consider the pines, spruces and firs.
These include the white, red and Scotch pines, all making
broad-headed trees eventually. Among the spruces, the Colorado blue
is familiar and beautiful, and the Norway is popular. Also well
known are the white, Black Hills and Englemann (especially in the
West) spruces. Among the first, consider the blue-tinted white fir,
the whitish-barked Arizona fir and the Douglas fir (the latter not
a true fir). Soft and graceful are the hemlocks, both eastern and
western.
   For trees of moderate-size and less spreading there are red
cedars (often called junipers) for dry places, arbor-vitae for wet
areas, and plume cypress (retinosporas) often used in foundation
plantings. The red cedars and arbor-vitae come in various forms and
color tones, such as Rocky Mountain juniper. The plume cypress
offers large variety _ fan foliage, plume, feathery and threadlike.
All three species grow quite tall _ to 30 feet or more in time.
   Rarer varieties are the Japanese cryptomeria and the umbrella
pine or sciadoptiys, both fairly narrow trees. Even narrower are
the Irish, Columnar Chinese, Italian or Arizona junipers.
   For hedges, yews are excellent and for low, flat forms there are
spreading junipers of a number of kinds.
   All of these may be planted in early and mid-fall. Prepare the
soil well. Dig holes two to three times the size of the root ball.
The soil to go around the roots should be made water-retentive by
adding 10-20 percent peat and fertilized with half as much dried
cow manure before shoveling the mixture in. Wait until growth
starts in spring before adding a chemical fertilizer.
   In all cases, water well, stake if support is necessary, and
mulch with 2 inches of peat, leaves, shredded bark or any similar
organic product.
   Finally, at the onset of winter and again in February, spray
trees with an antitranspirant (such as Foli-gard or Wilt-Pruf) to
hold in moisture.

   Don't worry about your plants if you are going on a short
vacation, say four to five days or a week.
   Set a group of plants on thoroughly soaked bath towels in the
bathtub, kitchen sink or laundry tub, exposed to some light, but
not direct sunlight. Then open the water faucet so that one drop of
water falls every few seconds on the towels. (Leave the drain
open.) The towels will conduct the moisture to the plant's soil,
keeping plants in good condition until you get home.
   If you have leftover vegetable and flower seeds and want to
store them for next season, keep them cool and dry. Store them in
tightly closed glass jars in a cool, dark place such as a dry
basement or garage. Under these conditions, they should keep well
and germinate when you plant them next spring.
   If your African violets appear a bit sickly, examine them for
small white specks on the leaves and stems. These probably are
scale insects or mealybugs that suck the juice from the plants.
They eventually will kill the plants if not stopped.
   Most garden shops have specially prepared sprays for delicate
plants such as the African violet.

   Air, light, space, soil, water. Work and greater
or lesser amounts of money. These basics for gardening have their
own dimensions in cities.
   Take air _ and pollution. Perhaps it's not as bad as one might
think, experts say. Wind carries some of it away. And nowadays,
industries are often located in industrial parks outside towns. The
rooftop gardener may have another air problem, though _ too much
wind. A bit of fencing or a windbreak of bushes can help this
situation.
   Light can be quirky in the city. Apartment windows, terraces,
patios, backyards and rooftop gardens hemmed in by tall buildings
may get most of their light from only one direction, or little
light at all except in mid-summer when the sun is most directly
overhead.
   But if the sun does strike one section of a terrace or walled
garden, white paint or reflecting material on that area will pitch
the light to the opposite side.
   In the case of little light, the city gardener will have to
settle for shade-loving plants. But he can still have a green sea
of ferns, myrtle, ajuga and hosta lilies, and colorful caladiums,
impatiens, begonias, astilbe, bulbs and the like, with ivy draping
his walls.
   In rooftop gardens, meanwhile, the sun may blaze down. Again,
the key to success is choosing the right plants. Zinnias and
tomatoes will love that sun.
   Garden books, seed catalogs, nurserymen and garden stores can
help one choose suitable plants.
   Precious space in the city can be stretched. Plants can be hung
from walls and ceilings and placed on shelves. Tomatoes, cucumbers
and other vining vegetables can be grown upward instead of outward.
   Most city gardening is done in containers. What soil should one
use?
   Many experts advise against soil dug up from a country friend's
garden. Soils become compacted more easily in limited space and may
not drain well.
   Some suggest mixtures _ for instance, equal parts of commercial
potting mix, compost or vermiculite, and common garden soil; or two
parts of compost and one part of garden soil with enough builders'
sand (or vermiculite) added to give the mixture a gritty feeling.
Some favor a soilless mix.
   Many gardeners agree that there's no set rule for watering
plants except not to let them get too dry or too wet and that one
thorough watering is better than several shallow ones. Different
plants have different water needs. But a rule of thumb for many
plants might be: if the soil is dry to a depth of one inch, water
it. Poke a finger into the soil to find out. Rooftop gardens may
need extra waterings.
   One way to water indoor plants thoroughly is to soak the
containers in a few inches of water in a bathtub.
   Just about anything will do for a container, it seems _ plastic
tubs and wastepaper baskets, bushel baskets, old wine cases and the
like. Just be sure they have drainage holes very near the bottom of
the container. Or one can pay big bucks for terra cotta, redwood
and decorative stone containers, or make one's own window boxes.
   Seed is an inexpensive way to start plants, but it takes time
and work to grow it, and the conditions may not be right. In that
case, buying plants may be the best bet.

   A garden with grape arbor and a lily pond on New
York's Bowery ... a children's fantasy garden on Chicago's North
Side ... a Laotian garden in Bridgeport, Conn. ... a garden plot at
a detoxification rehabilitation facility in Knoxville, Tenn.
   They all have one thing in common: they are community gardens,
as often as not the greening of a vacant lot in an underprivileged
neighborhood of an inner city. The people of the neighborhood dig,
prune, plant under the guidance of people who help with equipment
and know-how _ New York City's Green Guerillas, for instance, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service,
Knoxville County's Green Thumb.
   The American Community Gardening Association counts more than
260 member organizations. Its president, Brenda Funches, says it
plans to expand its membership, education and training of
professionals in the entire field of ``community greening.''
   The vacant lot for a community garden is often rented from the
city or other owner for a token dollar-a-year. So it may be ``here
today, gone tomorrow.'' Developers have sharp eyes for vacant lots
and big bucks to pay for them. However, progress toward longer-term
leases is reported in some cities. And if one site goes, others may
be found.
   In Bridgeport, more than 11,000 adults and 900 youths were
involved in the Urban Gardening Program last year. About half were
black, with Hispanics, whites, Asians and Pacific islanders, and
American Indians making up the rest, in that order. On a total
garden area of less than 8 acres, about $234,000 in produce was
grown. And, as its report pointed out, that does not include
``increased personal education and food skills, self-esteem,
neighborhood pride and cooperation, better public health and safety
from cleaned open space areas, better diets, community involvement,
and satisfaction in accomplishment.'' One garden is the work of
about 15 families of Laotian refugees.
   In Michigan, the Wayne County Senior Citizen's Gardening and
Greenhouse Association gardens more than 1 million square feet of
land and 9,000 square feet of greenhouse space. It is listed in the
``Guinness Book of World Records'' as the largest community garden
project in the world.
   Philadelphia Green, run by the Pennsylvania Horticultural
Society, works with more than 600 inner city groups on more than
1,000 gardening projects.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department, through its Cooperative
Extension Service, sponsors community gardening programs in 21
cities.
   In Knox County, Tenn., community gardens are part of the
Nutrition Project, designed to make more and better quality food
available at lower prices to low-income families.
   Children can be enthusiastic gardeners.
   In Graceland West, on Chicago's North Side, a garden blending
each of 13 children's ideas of a fantasy garden includes a shooting
star, cloud-9, a castle on a hill and a green caterpillar _ all
made of flowers and field weeds. The National Gardening Association
has a grant program that helps thousands of young gardeners each
year. Philadelphia Green helps indoor and outdoor gardening
projects in public schools.
   Meanwhile, New York's Green Guerillas have a special project at
a shelter for homeless men on Wards Island. Last year, they got
them to garden. This year, they plan to give the men horticultural
training in hopes some may get jobs.
   Then there's the garden on New York's Bowery that had a bumper
crop of apples last year _ and has beehives to produce honey.
   Local artists have been drawn into community gardening _
creating murals or sculpture to enhance the plots.
   ``Community garden is a metaphor for community development,''
says Jane Weissman, who heads New York's Operation GreenThumb. The
gardens become social centers, she says. Parties and barbecues are
held there. And people working together in the gardens decide to
tackle other projects in their neighborhoods.

   Rosemary stands for constancy and remembrance _
as Ophelia recalled in ``Hamlet.''
   The ancient Greeks used thyme as a temple incense and it is
prized today as a honey plant.
   Fennel, in literature and legend, is a symbol of flattery, a
remedy for failing eyesight and an aphrodisiac.
   To many of us, these and other herbs with equally intriguing
backgrounds are just those small containers of dried stuff on the
spice rack in the kitchen. And yet they had to grow somewhere. Why
not in one's own garden, or on the window sill?
   Herbs are not difficult to cultivate, take up little room, can
be grown indoors or out, in natural sunlight or under artificial
light. They are decorative and smell good as well as being edible
both fresh and dried. Relatively low in sodium, they're touted
these days as a way to give pizazz to salt-free or low-salt diets.
And there's the satisfaction of having produced something oneself.
   Some herbs are well-known _ basil, marjoram, oregano, thyme,
parsley. Somewhat less known, perhaps, are dill and fennel, savory,
chervil, horsemint, tarragon. Catnip is an herb (cat owners take
note).
   One of the largest families of herbs is basil: holy basil (it
smells like cloves); lemon, cinnamon and licorice basils (smelling
like what their names suggest); purple ruffles basil and ball
basil, as well as what we generally eat as plain basil.
   Not all herbs are used for eating. Some are dried and used as
air fresheners and sachets for drawers and closets (lavender and
lemon balm, for instance). Some are used in dried bouquets
(ambrosia and artemesia); some as decorative garden plants (catmint
with its aromatic silver foliage and lavender-blue flowers,
tricolor sage, with violet flowers and leaves marked in red, green
and white, gold edge thyme).
   Most herbs like lots of sun (basil is an exception, liking only
moderate amounts). Thalassa Cruso, in ``Making Vegetables Grow,''
says herbs have the strongest flavor if grown in rather sweet soil.
In the case of acid soil, add ground limestone. Some herbs are so
low they're used as ground covers, some can grow two or more feet
high.
   Herbs can be mixed with the flowers in a garden, used as borders
for flower beds, planted on the fringes of vegetable plots, given a
garden patch all their own, grown indoors on a window sill or on
shelves with fluorescent light. The ambitious gardener can create
an elaborate, decorative ``knot'' of herbs, as was popular in
Elizabethan times.
   Some herbs are perennial, some annual. Most can be grown from
seed, but in the case of some slow growers _ rosemary, for instance
_ buying plants is often recommended.
   Many botanic gardens and other public gardens have areas devoted
to herbs, where one can get ideas.
   As for using herbs, there are recipes and ideas galore, in
newspapers, books and magazines.

exercise and self-reliance in growing their own food as any other
gardener. Their planting can be done with pelleted seed, seed tape
or self-wrapped seeds.
   It's all part of an apparently growing interest in horticulture
as therapy for the mentally and physically disabled, senior
citizens and other people with special needs. More than 23,000 such
people are served daily by members of the American Horticultural
Therapy Association, which was formed in 1973.
   Working with plants is a form of therapy at about 300 hospitals,
the AHTA says.
   The Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University
Medical Center opened a horticultural therapy greenhouse in 1959
for victims of strokes and other physical disabilities. And
horticultural therapy is a program at the Florida Alcohol Treatment
Center.
   At the University of Nebraska Medical Center, gardening is part
of the therapy for older patients.
   ``Many nursing home residents, many from farm backgrounds, know
more about plant care than some of their caretakers,'' says Elaine
Matthis, of Elkhorn, Neb., who works with the elderly at the center.
   ``The problem with older adults is that sometimes there is a
sense of lost productivity. So maybe they can't work behind a
tiller, but they may be able to work with container gardening or at
a raised garden,'' she says. ``For people getting confused, who
need to resolve feelings of the past, who need to reminisce, it's
important to facilitate their thinking of the past.''

   How does your garden grow?
   Not with silver bells and cockle shells, despite the nursery
rhyme.
   It takes know-how to be a successful gardener and correcting
common misconceptions can make the difference, according to plant
care experts Jack Peters and Jim Knauss.
   The amateur gardener can increase the health potential of plants
throughout the year by knowing more about age-old assumptions that
aren't necessarily so, they say.
   ``In most of these cases, the amateur gardener tends to err on
the side of excess,'' says Knauss, who is manager of technical and
analytical information services at W.R. Grace & Co.'s Peter Plants
Food division. ``The healthiest plants are those that have the
benefit of simple, consistent attention.''
   One misconception, he says, is to always keep the soil surface
moist. ``A common practice,'' says Knauss, ``but one that can keep
plants and gardens from getting the air they need. The tell-tale
area is deeper within the soil. Before bringing out the watering
can, put a finger about 1-2 inches beneath the soil to test the
dryness. ... When watering, the liquid should go far beyond just
the surface, making sure the roots are fully moistened.''
   Another common idea to reassess is that selecting plants with
the lushest, greenest foliage at the garden center will ensure easy
care survival, says Peters, producer manager for Peters Plant Food.
   ``People tend to feel that a lush, healthy plant will remain
that way with a minimum of care and attention,'' he says. ``What
they don't see is the extent of the care that plant had been
receiving at the greenhouse or nursery. That particular plant may,
despite its looks, be quite difficult to maintain and keep healthy.
   ``Knowing about the variety and maintaining consistent
environments are the important determinants of long plant health,
not simply the original plant's appearance.''

   Jostaberry joins a nursery list this year that includes edible
hedges, thornless blackberries, dwarf conifers, cider apples and
ornamental grasses, among other gardening possibilities.
   The jostaberry is a cross between a black currant and a
gooseberry and is available from one of 84 mail-order nurseries
listed in the March-April issue of Harrowsmith, a magazine for
gardeners.
   It is high in vitamin C and well suited for jams, juices and
cordials, according to the magazine, which says one plant yields 11
pounds of berries. Jostaberry is available through the Bear Creek
Nursery in Northport, Wash.
   Also introduced in the Harrowsmith list this year is a blue
rose, called ``Blue Skies,'' available through Inter-State
Nurseries, Hamburg, Iowa.

   If you have seen birds flying in dizzy patterns late in the fall
it may be from feeding on fermented fruits on trees and shrubs.
They're tipsy.
   Some insects also appear drunk from tippling on fermented juices
of fallen fruit or fermented tree saps. Butterflies and wasps,
ants, flies and perhaps an occasional yellow jacket bee may do
likewise.

   When mowing the lawn this season, dress for safety is the
reminder from equipment manufacturers.
   ``Loose clothing can snag on controls or get caught in moving
parts, so tuck in shirttails and avoid dangling jewelry and flowing
scarfs,'' says Bob Tracinski, consumer information specialist for
John Deere, manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment.
   ``Wear slacks and hard shoes with non-slip soles to protect your
feet against hidden glass and sharp stones,'' he says.
   Other safety guidelines come from the Outdoor Power Equipment
Institute, a national trade association of manufacturers of gas and
electric-powered lawn and garden maintenance products:
   _ Review the operator's manual on how to set up equipment, how
to operate it safely and how to maintain it properly. Know where
the controls are and what they do.
   _ Handle gasoline carefully. Store gas in an approved container,
away from the house. Fill up before you start, while the engine is
cold.
   _ Before mowing, inspect the lawn for stones, sticks, wires,
toys and such. Be sure children and pets are a safe distance away.
   _ Mow in daylight. Don't mow wet grass.
   _ Mow in a forward direction; avoid cutting grass by pulling the
mower toward you. (If you must shift into reverse, make sure to
stop and check behind you, then back up slowly.)
   _ Keep hands and feet away from moving parts.
   _ Turn off the engine and remove the key if you need to leave
the equipment, even for a moment.

   Gardeners who wear broad-brimmed hats, coveralls, and heavy-duty
gloves while using an electric hedge clipper to trim bushes are
displaying common sense _ but not enough of it, says the American
Optometric Association.
   The garb protects the face from the sun, and clothing and hands
from the wear and tear of yard work, but the eyes are left exposed
and vulnerable to flying twigs, leaves and other debris.
   Nearly 3,400 Americans suffer eye injuries from lawnmowers and
home gardening equipment each year, according to the industry trade
group, which says most of the injuries could be prevented by the
use of proper safety eyewear.
   The optometrists warn that lawnmowers, other cutting tools and
garden chemicals can turn a seemingly harmless pastime into a
vision-endangering activity, one in which regular eyeglasses or
contact lenses do not provide enough protection.
   By federal regulation, eyeglasses are impact-resistant but they
still can be shattered by rocks or twigs thrown by power tools, and
spray or dust from weed killers and fertilizers can get around them.
   Inexpensive plastic safety goggles _ some of which even fit over
regular eyeglasses _ will meet most home gardeners' eye safety
needs, according to the association, which also notes that
protection from the sun's harmful rays and clear, comflettuce, New Zealand
spinach and a variety of
herbs are suggestions.

   Climbing plants may be supported by wrapping sphagnum or peat
moss around a broom handle and covering with meshed hardware cloth.
The pole should be anchored firmly in a sturdy, tip-proof clay or
other pot.
   Climbing foliage or other plants also may arrive from the
florist with supports made of bark, cedar, redwood or bamboo cane.

   If the lower leaves on your African violets appear to be rotting
and falling off, the problem may be petiole rot.
   This happens when the lower leaves rest on the pot rim. They get
droopy, then turn brown and soft and eventually shrivel. This
happens when fertilzier salts build up and injure the fragile
stems. Remove drooping leaves and cover pot rims with foil or tape
to prevent further problems.

   A coldframe can extend your gardening efforts, both in early
spring and in fall. It is useful to condition young seedlings that
were sown indoors for later planting outdoors.
   A coldframe can be built as a lean-to against the house by
covering the frame with a storm sash or a similar type of window.
The framework of the bed can be made of wood or concrete. For wood,
the boards should be 2 inches thick.
   The front of the frame should face south and should be at least
2 inches below ground level. The back portion of the frame should
be 6 inches higher than the front with a slope of about 1 inch per
foot. Bank up the soil on the outside of the frame to help conserve
heat.
   During spring and fall when the frame is in use, lift the sash
on warm days, but be sure to close it on cool nights to conserve
moisture and heat inside.

   House plants usually do most of their growing during the long
days of summer, so late winter or early spring is generally a good
time to re-pot those that have outgrown their containers.
   The best way to tell whether plants are root-bound is to tip
them out of their pots and examine the rootballs. If the ball of
soil is a mass of roots, with little soil visible, it's time for a
new pot.
   In extreme cases, plants may push themselves right up out of
their containers. repot in fresh soil in the next larger sized pot.
   Plants that have been doing poorly should perk up under the
combined influenced of increased light and more root space.

<HEAD>Japan to Decide on Beef, Citrus Issue by May 4</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Japan will
decide its position on the beef and citrus dispute with the United
States by May 4, a report said Monday.
   Takeshita met with Agiculture Minister Takashi Sato at the Diet
building and complimented him for his work in dealing with the
Americans even though the talks broke down, Kyodo News Service said.
   Takeshita said the United States had expressed interest in
continuing talks, Kyodo reported.
   No officials could be reached at Takeshita's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party or at Diet (parliament) offices to confirm the
report.
   Sato held talks with U.S. trade and commerce officials last week
on increasing American access of these products to Japan, but the
negotiations broke down after Japan refused to do away with import
quotas. A four-year, bilateral agreement on quotas limiting
American beef and citrus imports to Japan expired last Thursday.
   The United States has said it will take the issue to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, the 95-nation
international forum that can rule on trade disputes among its
members.
   May 4 is the day GATT convenes a special panel to hear the
American grievance.
   Earlier this year, another GATT panel ruled that Japanese import
quotas on beef products were illegal. A similar ruling is expected
if the GATT panel acts on the U.S. demand next month.

   The stock market turned downward today, faced
with rising interest rates and renewed uncertainties about
stronger-than-expected economic statistics.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 2.65 to 1,985.41
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 59.88 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Much of the activity stemmed from trading strategies in a few
high-yielding stocks based on their impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said, stocks and bonds were giving a cool
response to the Labor Department's report that payroll employment
continued to grow at an unexpectedly fast pace in March, expanding
by 262,000.
   The figures were issued on Friday, when the markets were closed
for the Easter and Passover holidays.
   In the first bond-market trading since then, interest rates rose
this morning.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric gained [ to
40{; International Business Machines was unchanged at 107|, and
Ford Motor dropped | to 42\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.49 to 146.11. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.02 at 295.41.
   On Thursday, before the long weekend, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 9.94 to 1,988.06, finishing the week with a gain of
9.11 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 807 up, 676 down and 485 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 139.87 million shares, against 151.81 million in the

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top IBM executive has confirmed that the
company has offered its state-of-the-art computer chips for sale to
other companies, according to a report published today.
   IBM's vice chairman and highest-ranking engineer, Jack D.
Kuehler, denied industry speculation that the company was acting to
prevent its American competitors from becoming dependent on
Japanese suppliers for chips, The New York Times reported.
   The chip is the core technology in advanced computers.
   Kuehler acknowledged that for more than two years the company
has offered small supplies of advanced chips to fewer than a dozen
American and European computer makers. The company did so ``to
sharpen our own competitiveness'' by letting other computer makers
choose between IBM's chips and those offered by Japanese companies,
he said.
   ``Sometimes we found we were deficient and we have worked to
correct that,'' he said. ``Sometimes we found we were truly
leaders.''
   But the Times reported that other industry officials suspected
that International Business Machines had other motives in acting as
a chip supplier to competitors, such as driving down its own
production costs.
   ``IBM is in the unusual position of having to worry about the
global competitiveness of American chip technology,'' said Richard
Shaffer, editor of the Technologic Computer Letter, which follows
the computer and semiconductor industries.
   IBM officials have said the company's own health depends on
maintaining a strong domestic ability to produce chips, train a
large number of microelectronic engineers and sustain a strong
semiconductor equipment manufacturing business so IBM will not need
to depend on Japan for the most up-to-date technology.
   Reports that IBM offered to sell chips to an archrival, Digital
Equipment Corporation, surfaced about 10 days ago and industry
sources then revealed the offers were more widespread.
   The company also has said it was selling only its chips, not its
underlying designs or process technology.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States rose by six this week to total 941, Baker Hughes Inc.
announced.
   In the previous week, the count lost eight rigs to total 935. A
year ago, the count totaled 752, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The rig count reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker company, tallies
the number of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched
industry index of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, New Mexico gained eight
rigs, Oklahoma, seven; Colorado, five; Kansas and Louisiana, four
each; California, three; and North Dakota, two.
   Texas lost nine, Wyoming lost three; and Pennsylvania's rig
count fell by two.

   Corn and soybean futures prices advanced while
wheat prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Government reports on prospective spring plantings and grain
stocks sent soybean contracts to new highs and encouraged traders
to hedge by buying corn and beans while selling wheat, analysts
said.
   The Agriculture Department's annual report on farmers' spring
planting intentions, released Thursday, predicted about a 1 percent
increase in soybean acreage to 57.9 million acres. That figure was
well below the average pre-report estimate of 59.1 million acres.
   Buying also was encouraged by the the department's quarterly
report on grain stocks. The report estimated soybean stocks at
almost 1.15 billion bushels as of March 1, slightly below the
pre-report estimate.
   The reports showed corn planting intentions at 66.9 million
acres, up 2 percent from last year but slightly below expectations.
That figure was offset by the corn stocks estimate of 7.6 billion
bushels, slightly above estimates.
   The reports were ``bullish for beans, neutral for wheat and in
corn the stocks figure was bearish and the acreage figure was
bullish,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cent lower to 1 cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in May at $2.98{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3\ cents higher, with May at $2.10} a bushel; oats were 3
cents to 5{ cents higher, with May at $1.64{ a bushel; and soybeans
were 13 cents to 15} cents higher, with May at $6.67{ a bushel.
   Cattle and hog prices rallied in early trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .47 cent to 1.10 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in April at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.45 cent to .80 cent higher with April at 81.50 cents a pound; hogs
were .70 cent to 1.50 cents higher, with April at 46.25 cents a
pound; and pork bellies were 1.48 cents to 2 cents higher with May
at 57.60 cents a pound.
   Cattle and hog futures prices were mostly lower and pork bellies
were mixed in trading Thursday, the last day of trading before the
three-day holiday weekend.

   A merger agreement signed between The Beard
Co. of Oklahoma City and Union Pacific Corp. will give Union
Pacific ownership of all outstanding Beard shares in a deal worth
nearly $100 million.
   Union Pacific, which is based in New York, also will acquire the
almost 3.6 million shares of USPCI Inc. that Beard owned. Union
Pacific became a majority owner in January of USPCI, a hazardous
waste management company based in Oklahoma City.
   Beard and Union Pacific announced Friday the merger agreement
had been signed.
   Under terms of the agreement, Beard shareholders will receive
$10 in cash and one share of Beard Oil Co. for each share of The
Beard Co.
   Beard Oil is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Beard Co. Union
Pacific is to provide $85.5 million for payments to Beard
shareholders and to repay company debt. The more than 1 million
shares of Beard owned by Union Pacific will be canceled.
   Another term of the agreement calls for the 375,000 shares of
USPCI now owned by Beard Oil to be purchased by Union Pacific for
$28 per share.

   The stock market was mixed today, faced with
rising interest rates and renewed uncertainties about
stronger-than-expected economic statistics.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 9.45 to 1,997.51
by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 8 to 5 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 498 up, 814
down and 472 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110.79 million shares at
noontime, up from 67.27 million at the same point last Thursday.
   Much of that increased turnover stemmed from trading strategies
in a few high-yielding stocks based on their impending dividend
payments.
   Likewise, the Dow Jones industrial average's gain was
concentrated in a single issue _ F.W. Woolworth, which jumped 8] to
53|. The company said it had received notice that a group headed by
Herbert Haft was seeking regulatory approval to buy up to 15
percent of its stock.
   Otherwise, analysts said, stocks and bonds were giving a cool
response to the Labor Department's report that payroll employment
continued to grow at an unexpectedly fast pace in March, expanding
by 262,000.
   The figures were issued on Friday, when the markets were closed
for the Easter and Passover holidays.
   In the first bond-market trading since then, interest rates rose
this morning. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than
$10 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the
neighborhood of 8.9 percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .36 to 146.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .65 at 295.83.

   A top expert in the race to develop
high-temperature superconductors said today he has rejected efforts
to lure him to the University of California, Berkeley, and will
stay at the University of Houston.
   ``This has been one of the most diffhcult decisions in my life.
The offer from the University of California, Berkeley, was
excellent and had me torn between my loyalty to UH and a desire to
be at Berkeley, as it has been a personal goal to join the Berkeley
faculty,'' scientist Paul C.W. Chu said in a statement.
   ``Yet developing the superconductivity effort at UH is a great
responsibility. ... With the enthusiastic support I have received
at UH, I should be able to achieve my professional goals,'' he
added.
   Chu called P. Buford Price, the chairman of the UC-Berkeley
physics department, on Friday, the deadline for his response, and
said he would stay in Texas.
   Chu left no uncertainty that he was rejecting the Berkeley
offer, Price said. ``No further action would be taken to recruit
Chu,'' he said.
   Chu's decision was reported over the weekend by the Los Angeles
Times and the Houston Post.
   Chu ``has built up a group there (in Houston) and he feels
responsible to them,'' said UC-Berkeley physicist Marvin L. Cohen,
who first urged UC officials to recruit his friend. ``The program
is coming along at a resounding clip.''
   The Houston scientist reportedly was concerned that if he moved
to Berkeley, he would abandon people who have supported him for a
decade.
   Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance.
Researchers are trying to develop materials that are
superconducting at room temperature. Existing superconductors work
only at extreme subfreezing temperatures, although Chu and other
scientists have been discovering substances that work at
progressively warmer temperatures.
   Scientists believe high-temperature superconductors may
revolutionize electrical transmission, computers, trains, motors
and many other electrical devices.
   Cohen said much of the financing for superconductivity research
at the University of Houston was being provided because of Chu's
presence.
   The university pays Chu a nine-month teaching salary of
$150,000, with an option to earn another $50,000 by working
summers. A UC spokesman said senior professors at Berkeley usually
earn half that amount, although the school didn't disclose its
offer to Chu.
   Cohen said Chu may also have considered the career of his wife,
May Chu, who is now vice president of a Houston bank.
   Officials at Berkeley wooed the reticent Chu in recent months
with an offer of a combined teaching-research position.

<HEAD>New Cheese Makers Think They Have The Recipe For Success</HEAD>

   The ingredients that have created the
13-pound wheel of cheese Brian Bailey thumps with his thumb include
the weakening U.S. dollar, America's trade imbalance, and, of
course, carefully selected milk.
   The maker of the cheese, Steuben Foods Inc., believes the
combination is going to make the European-style cheese a big hit
with American consumers who are buying more cheese than ever.
   ``We believe we have a lot of things going for us,'' said Ken
Schlossberg, president of Steuben Foods, a subsidiary of the giant
New York City-based Elmhurst Dairy Corp. ``This is where we think
the next opportunity in the dairy business is.''
   Here are the reasons for his optimism:
   _Americans are looking to buy more unusual cheese, the kind
consumers find in gourmet sections of local supermarkets, but much
of that cheese is imported from Europe.
   And, although it is not widely known, the United States has
strict import quotas on the amount of cheese that can be brought
into this country, allowing only 240 million pounds a year.
   American cheese makers produced 5.3 billion pounds of cheese
last year.
   ``It's about as restrictive a policy as you can imagine,'' said
Richard Koby, counsel for the New York-based cheese importers
Association of America. ``I don't think anyone could say how much
cheese would come in if there were no quotas.''
   _The dollar's value has weakened against other major world
currencies, which means some imported products have become more
expensive. While the dollar's strength is often talked about in
terms of the price of automobiles or stereo equipment, it also has
an impact on the cheese business.
   ``I don't want to say we're economic geniuses, but three years
ago we thought the dollar was pretty high and it could only go one
way and that's come to pass and we're now starting to see some real
rising in the price of European products,'' Schlossberg said.
   The weak dollar makes Steuben's cheeses, called Castleborg and
Saint Rochelle, more attractive when displayed next to the European
or Scandanavian cheeses.
   _The cheeses are made using the traditional know-how of
Finland's largest cheese maker, Valio, and Finnish and Danish
equipment, along with bacteria cultures flown in weekly from
Helsinki.
   Bailey learned Finnish, sat in saunas and brought back a pair of
clogs and the knowledge of the master cheese makers of Finland to
supervise the production of about 16,000 pounds of cheese a day.
   ``During one visit they made me an honorary Finn. That's where
you have to roast in the hot sauna and then run and jump into the
icy Baltic,'' he said.
   Signs confirming the company's optimism for the new cheese are
beginning to appear.
   The Castleborg cheese _ a sweet, Swiss-like variety _ won the
top award in the open competition at the U.S. Cheese Makers
Association contest last fall, even before it hit store shelves.
This spring, both cheeses, priced at $5 a pound, will be available
across the country.
   ``What we're hoping is to make consumers aware of the brand of
cheese so they feel comfortable buying it. We've found that when
people go to buy this kind of cheese they're very nervous and
suspect about what they're actually going to get,'' Schlossberg
said.
   Ventures like Steuben's are becoming more and more common in the
cheese industry, which for a long time was like winemaking, where
foreign and American interests seldom hook up.
   Several European firms have bought cheese factories in Wisconsin
and other states to make their products in the U.S. for a number of
reasons including freshness, the currency and quota fluctuations
said James Tillison, executive director of the U.S. Cheese Makers
Association in Madison, Wis.
   ``I don't think you're going to see a mad rush, but I think the
trend will certainly continue,'' he said.
   He said cheese sales in the United States have increased by more
than 25 percent in the last four years, and that one of the
fastest-growing segments is specialty cheese such as Brie,
Jarlsberg, Gouda, Edam and Camembert.
   By far the most popular cheeses consumed in this country are
American and Mozzarella, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all
the cheese produced in the United States, Tillison said.
   Wisconsin is by far the nation's largest cheese maker, followed
by Minnesota and New York.
   ``It's a shame, but Americans seem to buy and judge their cheese
by how well it melts over macaroni or whether you can make pizza
with it,'' Bailey said. ``In Finland, they eat pieces of cheese for
breakfast. That's the way it should be.''
   Bailey carefully selects the right milk from the 58,000 gallons
of milk that come into this small plant each day, saving some for
the cheese and routing the rest to the milk plant in New York or to
Steuben's Whitney yogurt plant near Buffalo.
   He can almost look at milk and know what kind of cow it comes
from, and when he taps parafin-coated wheels of cheese he can
fairly accurately predict the size and amount of ``eyes,'' or
holes, in the cheese.
   Making such cheese with care and attention to detail is somewhat
unusual in the United States where huge processing plants roll off
millions of pounds of American, mozzarrella and cheddar in
assembly-line fashion.
   Schlossberg said Steuben Foods didn't want to follow in those
footsteps. ``As we looked into it, we heard the same things that
you hear about American wines; that you couldn't produce good
cheese in the U.S., that there's something about Europe, it's the
milk, it's the who knows, it's the air,'' he said.
   ``Needless to say, we didn't buy that.''

<HEAD>Some Foreign Businessmen Get Help Cracking Japan's Markets</HEAD>

   When David Jackson of New Zealand packed up his
rugby shirt display to bring to Japan, he tossed in a sweatshirt
made from brightly colored scrap materials gathered from the shop
floor.
   Unfortunately, that's the one Japanese retailers liked.
   ``We did it as a joke,'' he said. ``Now they've ordered 2,000 of
them _ exactly the same as this one. These were one-of-a-kind
items,'' he said ruefully. ``I don't know how we're going to be
able to duplicate them.
   ``It just goes to show you that you can't second-guess the
Japanese market. We have to be ready to accept what the market
tells us.''
   Jackson was one of more than 200 exhibitors invited from 16
countries to display their sports products at a recent trade fair,
with help from the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).
   The fair is one way the Japanese government is trying to ease
friction with other countries after piling up a trade surplus of
$82.7 billion in 1987.
   Japan and the United States, for instance, have argued over
Japanese restrictions on beef and citrus imports as well as
American access to big Japanese construction projects. Still, there
are areas in which Japan is spending its own money to encourage
imports.
   Masahiro Suzuki, assistant director of the JETRO trade fair
department, said this _ the fifth such fair held since 1985 _ was
an important means of showing foreign businessmen they can compete
against Japanese products.
   The fair cost 200 million yen, or about $1.6 million, to produce
and exhibitors were charged $1,000 each, which means the Japanese
government paid more than $5,000 for each of the exhibits, Suzuki
said.
   ``Newcomers don't know how to approach the Japanese market. We
have to help them,'' Suzuki said.
   Other items featured at the five-day fair included pool tables,
gliders, surfboards, automatic golf tees, lawn bowling games,
crossbows, skateboards and puzzles. The Japanese were particularly
curious about the ``Hog Hair Pork Rind Bait'' available at the
California state booth, the guide to 750 American golf courses, and
the $3,700 electronic dart board set.
   Stefan Schinzinger, president of the San Francisco Hat Company,
said he received three invitations from the Japanese to attend this
year's trade show, and he finally accepted. He said it will take
him months to sort out the business prospects the show produced.
   Schinzinger said he also had to make adjustments for the
Japanese markets. One product was a sock with leather soles used by
space shuttle astronauts to keep their feet warm.
   ``The Japanese don't use leather on their slippers. They
suggested it might sell better without the leather, and be cheaper
to make. It just shows you can't force-fit an American product to
the Japanese market,'' he said.
   Schinzinger praised the Japanese government for taking steps to
help foreign businessmen sell their products, and said it was
impossible to get help on trade matters from the American
government.
   ``My experience with the U.S. government commercial office is
that they are there to help the large multinational companies. The
service I get (from the American government) is non-existent,'' he
said.
   Schinzinger said the fair on sports items was extremely popular
because there is little competition from the Japanese.
   ``The Japanese in the past haven't had any leisure time. They
worked six days a week, and spent one day at home with the family.
Now, they're being encouraged to work a five-day week, and sports
are becoming very popular.
   ``Now, everyone is going at it with the typical enthusiasm of
the Japanese. When they get into a sport, they want all the
knicknacks that go along with it.''
   Those attending the show included the public, retailers,
wholesalers and manufacturers.
   Schinzinger said many of the foreign participants were angered
at the visits by Japanese manufacturers.
   ``We know we're helping them develop new businesses,''
Schinzinger said. ``They come to the show, see what's popular, and
they'll make it themselves.''
   However, he said participants were promised six months of
product protection after the show, during which time they will have
an exclusive right to sell their products in Japan.
   ``That's enough time to file for a patent if you think your
product will do well here,'' he said.
   However, just to be sure, he took out an $800 patent on his
company's name before he left the United States.

<HEAD>National Recessions: Things of the Past?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sooner or later, pet economic theories become
battered by events and must be recycled through academe before
reappearing in altered form.
   It is for this reason that several of the old economic models _
monetary, Keynesian and supply side among them _ are in for a
periodic overhaul, while a new one, based mainly on recent
experience, is attracting attention.
   Perhaps most interesting, at least from a popular view, is that
it offers an optimistic view of things at a time when some of the
old models are flashing warnings lights and setting off sirens and
bells.
   Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities calls his version
New Wave Economics, basing it not on any lab theory of what the
economy ``should'' be doing, but simply on what it has been doing.
   Among its conclusions is this gem: Economy-wide recessions are
unlikely to occur in the future. More likely, there will be rolling
recessions ``limited to certain industries and sections of the
country.''
   The viewpoint has a solid basis in recent and current economic
matters. It describes, for example, the very thing that has been
occurring in the U.S. economy over the past five years, although
disguised by traditional measures.
   The traditional view is that the U.S. economy has expanded
steadily for five long years and that, therefore, it is becoming
old, weary and destined to fall into recession.
   Wait a minute, say less traditional economists. National figures
do indeed show an uninterrupted expansion, but national figures
tend to hide what has happened in specific industries and regions
within the nation.
   The most obvious example of national figures disguising rather
than revealing is how the boom in the Northeast and in certain
other areas badly warped the national numbers for nearly two years
between 1985 and 1987.
   While the Massachusetts service economy couldn't be stopped in
that time, the industries and economies of 31 other states, mainly
those involved with or related to agriculture, oil and other
natural resources, couldn't get started.
   Sindlinger & Co., economic and marketing analysts, repeatedly
pointed this out. Consumer confidence, payrolls, spending and other
measurements also suggested it.
   The truth was always there in the official statistics; most
analysts, however, chose the national averages instead. For one
thing, federal economic policy swings more on national rather than
regional numbers.
   But in Yardeni's opinion, the bond market, including a global
market for U.S. Treasury securities, is likely to be a more
effective economic guide than Federal Reserve policy, protecting
the economy from booms that lead to busts.
   ``It will react faster to dampen booms. Which suggests that the
severe busts will no longer be necessary to unwind the excess
caused by the booms. Excesses won't be allowed to build up in the
first place.''
   If he and like-thinkers are correct, there may be regional
recessions in the future, as there was for almost two years between
Memorial Day 1985 and and February 1987, but national recessions
will be rarer.
   In fact, it might be argued that rather than facing a recession
in the next year or so, the U.S. economy might already have put one
behind it _ a regional recession that just didn't count in the
national statistics.

<HEAD>Beef Remains An Elusive Delicacy To Many Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONIKA JAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For housewives like Kazuko Higo, beef is a delicacy
she can afford only rarely _ almost as infrequently as her three
grown sons come to visit, she laments.
   ``Japanese beef is so expensive,'' she said while doing her
shopping at Tokyo's Peacock supermarket. ``I only cook it on
occasions when my sons come to visit once every two weeks.''
   For shoppers at Peacock, Japanese sirloin costs 450 yen per 100
grams, or $16.36 a pound.
   A similar Australian cut sells for $13.82 a pound. American
sirloin, when it can be found, retails at a relatively inexpensive
$7.45 a pound.
   The staggering difference in price between the domestic and
imported meat is behind the American demand that Japan drop all
import restrictions on beef, citrus fruits and other agricultural
products.
   Increased sales of U.S. beef in Japan could shrink the record
$59.8 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   Through a stringent quota system, Japan limits beef imports to
protect its politically powerful farmers, who support the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party. They are currenty guaranteed 70 percent
of the beef used locally. The remaining 30 percent is imported.
   High-level talks between the two nations on terminating the
import quotas ended in failure late Thursday in Washington as Japan
refused U.S. demands. Japan has maintained it will only increase
its quotas, not drop them entirely.
   Japan nearly doubled its annual quota for high-grade American
beef imports since 1983 under a four-year agreement that expired
Thursday. Its overall quota for beef imports was raised by a
smaller amount.
   The United States said it would petition the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, an international forum that oversees trade
rules, to have the import quota procedures deemed illegal.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Monday he would decide
Japan's negotiating position by May 4, the date a GATT panel takes
up the U.S. grievance.
   Mrs. Higo said, ``My sons prefer American beef. They're only
concerned about volume in their meat and are not too particular
about the taste.''
   ``But my husband and I, we prefer Japanese beef, it's so much
more tender and better tasting. Also, it's a lot easier on the
teeth,'' added the 48-year-old housewife.
   Tsukasa Yanagi, assistant manager at Peacock, said the store
sells about 154 pounds of Japanese beef a day, but regulations
limit it to selling only 28 pounds of American beef a day.
   ``Of course if our store quota is increased, we can sell a lot
more,'' said Yanagi. ``By the end of the day, the foreign beef is
always sold out because it's much cheaper.''
   ``We'd like to be able to keep more American beef,'' he added.
``Our No. 1 priority is to provide customers with tasty but
inexpensive meat.''
   Yanagi said the store's beef prices and sales quotas are set by
the quasi-governmental Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation,
LIPC.
   That organization, set up in 1961 to regulate and stabilize beef
prices, handles about 80 percent of the meat sold nationwide, said
Mitsuru Yoshida, a director at the organization.
   He said the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
annually decides the floor and ceiling wholesale prices for
domestic beef.
   The price of the imported beef is then fixed according to its
nearest corresponding Japanese cut.
   When the wholesale prices are decided, the beef, both imported
and domestic, is channeled to distributors, and normal costs,
including retailers' profits, are added.
   Once the meat is on the supermarket shelves, ``If the price of
the domestic beef shoots up, the amount of the imported beef is
increased,'' Yoshida said. ``If the price of the Japanese beef
falls, the foreign meat is pulled back from the market.''
   ``But if the price of Japanese beef fails to rise, the LIPC will
buy the meat and keep it in stock,'' Yoshida said.
   This non-tariff barrier is typical of Japanese efforts to
cushion local industries against foreign competition.
   Zenchu, the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, is also
going after the heart and mind of the Japanese consumer. It has
produced a video showing what it claims are the harmful side
effects of eating imported food loaded with preservatives and
chemicals, said a spokeswoman for the All-Japan Agricultural Cinema
Association, which produced the 30-minute movie.
   Titled ``Even Then, Would You Still Eat It?'' the video alleges
that monkeys fed imported food gave birth to deformed babies, while
the number of Japanese children falling sick after eating the food
has increased.
   The spokeswoman said about 2,000 copies of the video have been
sold at $80 a copy since it was released in January, most to
agricultural concerns.
   Kumiko Sato, a mother of three children, says she does not cook
foreign beef ``because it smells and the blood is not drained
totally from the meat.''
   ``I prefer Japanese beef because it's tender and does not
contain too much oil,'' she said, ``but it's so expensive.''
   ``Japan should liberalize its market so that at least local
prices will fall,'' she added.

   The stock market retreated today, faced with
rising interest rates and renewed uncertainties about
stronger-than-expected economic statistics.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.47 to 1,982.59
by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 425 up, 1,022
down and 427 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came 143.15 million shares with two
hours to go.
   A big chunk of the activity stemmed from trading strategies in a
few high-yielding stocks based on their impending dividend payments.
   The Dow Jones industrial average would have shown a considerably
wider loss but for the preformance of one of its components _ F.W.
Woolworth, which jumped 8[ to 53]. The company said it had received
notice that a group headed by Herbert Haft was seeking regulatory
approval to buy up to 15 percent of its stock.
   Otherwise, analysts said, stocks and bonds were giving a cool
response to the Labor Department's report that payroll employment
continued to grow at an unexpectedly fast pace in March, expanding
by 262,000.
   The figures were issued on Friday, when the markets were closed
for the Easter and Passover holidays.
   In the first bond-market trading since then, interest rates rose
today. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $10 for
each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the neighborhood
of 8.9 percent.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down ] at 107\; Exxon, down | at 41], and American
Telephone & Telegraph, down { at 26{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.16 to 145.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.31 at 295.12.

   Four days into the season, Oregon shrimp
fishermen have yet to settle on a price and no one appears to be in
any hurry to set one, fisheries officials said today.
   Processors have abundant inventories of shrimp left over from
last year's catch and bad weather over the weekend would have kept
fishermen in port even if they had a price, said Mark Saelens,
shellfish biologist for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
   ``The typical process is fishermen will not come to a settlement
during a time of unsettled weather,'' said Saelens. ``They're
really in no hurry.''
   When the season opened Friday, shrimp fishermen up and down the
West Coast stayed in port rather than accept the going rate of
about 40 cents a pound.
   Neil Richmond of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in
Charleston said he hadn't heard of any price settlements in
California or Washington, either.
   ``We are hopeful it will be settled by midweek,'' said Richmond.
   Shrimpers in Astoria were to meet with processors Tuesday to
discuss a price, said Grant Larson, plant manager at Ocean Foods of
Astoria Inc.
   However, with bad weather making fishing difficult, he didn't
hold out much hope for an immediate agreement.
   ``I don't see anything happening for the rest of the week,'' he
said.
   With a catch of 46 million pounds last year, Oregon's fleet of
120 shrimp boats is the leading producer of pink shrimp on the West
Coast. Washington's catch was 16 million pounds and California's
was 8 million pounds.
   Between 1 million and 2 million pounds of shrimp left over from
last year is still on hand in cold storage, Saelens said.
   ``Not only do they have an inventory they have to get rid of,
but the market itself is not as interested in consuming whatever
grade that is they are handling,'' Saelens said.
   Richmond said he had heard prices under discussion ranged
between 35 cents per pound and 55 cents per pound.
   ``The processors feel they can't pay what the fishermen are
asking and the fishermen feel they can't afford to go out at the
price they are offering,'' Saelens said.
   Last year's price averaged 68 cents per pound, with a high of 80
cents in May brought on by strong demand.
   In recent years, the value of catches has been hurt by a large
number of small shrimp known as pinheads. By law, catches can't
exceed 160 shrimp per pound.
   ``In general, sometime in mid-summer, late June, July, the
pinheads are first reaching a size when 100 percent of them will be
legal,'' Saelens said.

<HEAD>Woolworth: Hafts Intend to Acquire Retailer's Stock</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be led with closing stock price</NOTE>

   F.W. Woolworth Co. said Monday it received
notice that Dart Group Corp. intends to acquire a substantial
amount of the retailer's stock in what could be the beginning of a
takeover bid for the nation's 13th largest retailer.
   Woolworth, which built its reputation in the five-and-dime store
business before expanding into specialty retailing, responded to
Dart's move with the adoption by its board of a ``poison-pill''
takeover defense.
   The retailer said in a statement it was notified a partnership
controlled by Dart Chairman Herbert Haft had filed with federal
antitrust officials documents indicating the group intended to
acquire $15 million or more of Woolworth's stock.
   Less than a month ago, the Haft family dropped a $1.03 billion
bid for Stop & Shop Cos. after their target agreed to a leveraged
buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Wall Street expected the Hafts to make a bid for Woolworth. The
retailer's stock shot up $8.25 to $53.50 in late afternoon on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   The Hafts have said in the past they are serious about buying
and operating a retailer, but doubts linger about their intentions.
Dart's string of unsuccessful but profitable takeover attempts in
recent years has given Herbert Haft and his son, Dart President
Robert Haft, reputations as corporate raiders.
   Robert Haft was not available when a reporter called for comment
Monday.
   A source close to Dart confirmed that the partnership had made a
filing on March 18 with the federal government in compliance with
the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act.
   Under the act, parties seeking to acquire a substantial stake in
a company must notify the government of their intentions.
   The source declined to say whether a takeover bid was in the
offing.
   Karen Sack, a retail industry analyst with Standard & Poor's
Corp., said Woolworth has been mentioned recently as a possible
target for a takeover attempt.
   Edward Johnson, an analyst with Prescott Ball & Turben Inc.,
said Wall Street believes Woolworth stock would be worth about $67
under a buyout. The low stock price and Woolworth's low-rental
properties and successful specialty store formats make it an
attractive target, he said.
   If the Hafts do make a bid, Woolworth would be expected to fight
it. In the company's statement, it said the retailer's board had
adopted the poison pill ``to deter coercive or unfair takeover
tactics and to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of the
company without offering a fair price to all shareholders.''
   The pill adopted by Woolworth's board would allow the company's
shareholders to buy its stock at a steep discount. It would go into
effect when a person or group acquires 20 percent of Woolworth's
stock, on the commencement of a tender offer for 30 percent or more
of the retailer's shares, or when an adverse party acquires at
least 15 percent of the company's stock.
   Joseph Carroll, a Woolworth spokesman, declined to comment when
asked what steps the company might take if and when the Hafts make
a takeover bid.
   Johnson said the company might consider going private under a
leveraged buyout.
   Other options open to the retailer include making an acquisition
itself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders.
   Woolworth, founded 109 years ago by Frank W. Woolworth as a
five-and-dime store, has grown to an empire of more than 6,300
general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide. In recent
years, the company has shifted its focus from its well-known
Woolworth stores to its specialty operations, which include Kinney
shoe stores and Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker athletic footwear
stores.
   Ms. Sack said Woolworth ``has done very well'' as a result of
its restructuring.
   For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Woolworth earned $251 million
on sales of $7.14 billion.
   Before their unsuccessful attempt at taking over Stop & Shop,
the Hafts began a hostile bid for Dayton Hudson Corp. that they
were forced to end when the stock market crashed. Their previous
targets include Supermarkets General Corp. and Safeway Stores Inc.
   Dart has made hundreds of millions of dollars from their
takeover forays by selling their stock at a higher price after the
companies successfully defended themselves.
   Johnson said that if the Hafts are serious about buying a
retailer, Woolworth, with its specialty operations, would be an
appropriate target. Dart operates two specialty chains, Crown Books
and Trak Auto.

   Soybean futures prices soared and set new
contract highs while grains were mostly higher in trading Monday at
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The Agriculture Department's reports on spring planting
intentions and grain stocks sparked a flurry on buying in the
soybean pit, where traders saw indications of tight soybean
supplies in the coming year.
   The department's annual report on farmers' spring planting
intentions, released Thursday, predicted about a 1 percent increase
in soybean acreage to 57.9 million acres _ well below the estimate
of 59.1 million acres.
   The department's quarterly grain stocks report estimated
soybeans at almost 1.15 billion bushels as of March 1, slightly
below the pre-report estimate.
   New contract highs were made in soybeans, but buying slacked off
amid heavy profit-taking later in the session, said Victor
Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Buying in new crop corn for delivery in deferred months was
sparked by the report showing spring planting intentions at 66.9
million acres, up 2 percent from last year but well below
expectations, Lespinasse said.
   But more bearish news came from the corn stocks estimate of 7.6
billion bushels, slightly above estimates.
   Wheat prices rose ``in sympathy with strength in the beans,''
Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat was } cents to 3 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.00\ a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to 3\ cents higher with May at $2.09 a bushel; oats were 2{
cents to 4} cents higher with May at $1.64 a bushel; and soybeans
were 15{ cents to 18} cents higher, with May at $6.69 a bushel.

<HEAD>High Court Lets Libel Award Stand; Agrees to Review Liability
Rulings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a $3
million libel award won by cigarette maker Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp. against CBS Inc. and a television anchorman in
Chicago.
   In another significant case, the high court agreed to review
rulings limiting Korean Air Lines' financial liability for a 1983
disaster in which 269 people died _ the shooting down of a KAL
passenger jet over Soviet airspace.
   The justices also agreed to examine the authority of federal
judges to second-guess decisions by pension and welfare plans that
deny benefits to workers.
   In other decisions announced Monday in business-related cases,
the high court:
   _Refused to block the Federal Trade Commission from
investigating allegedly anti-competitive practices of state
agencies that license and regulate professionals.
   _Gave federal agencies more leeway in dealing with labor unions
representing their employees, and
   _Rejected a challenge to New York City's rent control law.
   In the tobacco libel decision the court, without comment,
rejected arguments that the $3 million award _ one of the largest
libel verdicts ever upheld on appeal _ violated the rights of CBS
and its newscaster.
   Brown & Williamson, which makes Viceroy cigarettes, accused the
network and WBBM-TV anchorman Walter Jacobson of libeling it in a
Nov. 11, 1981, broadcast. The Chicago station is owned and operated
by CBS.
   Jacobson was accused of libeling the cigarette company in a
nightly feature called ``Walter Jacobson's Perspective.''
   He said there was a Viceroy advertising strategy to attract
young people to smoking by relating cigarettes ``to pot, wine, beer
and sex.'' He said the idea was to present cigarette smoking as
``an initiation into the adult world ... as an illicit pleasure.''
   His remarks were based in part on what he said was a
confidential report prepared by the Federal Trade Commission.
   The Korean Air Lines case stemmed from the September 1983 air
disaster in which a Soviet military plane shot down KAL Flight 007
en route from New York City to Seoul, South Korea. The Korean
airliner had flown more than 300 miles off course after leaving
Anchorage, Alaska, and had entered Soviet airspace over the Sea of
Japan.
   The Supreme Court justices said they will study arguments that
Korean Air Lines should have to face more than $75,000 in damages
for each death.
   In the pension case, the court said it will hear an appeal by
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. in a case stemming from the sale of its
plastics division in 1980.
   Firestone sold the division to Occidental Petroleum Corp. The
sale affected some 500 workers at Firestone plants in Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Maryland and Louisiana.
   The workers then sought certain benefits from Firestone,
including early retirement and severance pay, that were included in
the company's pension and welfare plan.
   The company denied the benefits. It also refused to give the
workers information they requested about the benefit plan on
grounds they no longer were employed by Firestone.
   The workers sued in federal court, charging that the company
violated the federal Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA).
   A judge threw out the suit on grounds that Firestone did not act
in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals reinstated the suit, however.

   For the decades when F.W. Woolworth Co.'s
five-and-dimes dotted the retail landscape, the company symbolized
homespun American merchandising.
   But changing times and consumer taste forced the 109-year-old
company to take harsh measures to keep that image from fading like
an old tintype photograph.
   Those efforts paid off so well in terms of the bottom line that
Woolworth not only returned to the path of profitability, but now
lies in the takeover path of Maryland's raiding Haft family.
   The Hafts, who have left a string of aborted acquisition
attempts for other major retailers in their wake, said in
government documents that they intend to buy up to $15 million in
Woolworth stock in what could be the first step in a takeover bid.
   For all their overtures, the father-and-son team of Herbert and
Robert Haft and their Dart Group Corp. is short on the retail
tradition Woolworth is steeped in.
   Founded in 1879 by upstate New York farmboy Frank Woolworth, the
chain pioneered the five-cent counter, which carried everything
from bobby pins to ``real'' crystal glasses. Woolworth's
rummage-sale prices allowed the homemaker of yesteryear to outfit a
kitchen with gadgetry from potato mashers to frying pans for just a
few dollars.
   The public's welcoming of Woolworth with open pocketbook spurred
the company to add a 10-cent line, in turn forcing a name change to
``Woolworth's 5 and 10 Cent Store.''
   While the five-and-dime label still sticks, the description
became a misnomer in 1932 when the company could no longer sell its
products for 5 and 10 cents, Woolworth spokesman J.F. Carroll said.
   The 60-story headquarters in lower Manhattan the company built
in 1913 _ replete with gargoyles and patterned after a Gothic
cathedral _ was a testament to the chain's status among its peers.
   But Woolworth's rankings slipped consistently in recent years.
In 1979 it was the nation's fourth largest; today it is No. 13.
   S.S. Kresge Co., always lurking nearby as a major competitor,
surpassed Woolworth's long ago by successful suburban expansion
through K mart, the name Kresge adopted in 1977.
   Woolworth began to lose its footing when it rode a
diversification wave in the early 1960s by starting Woolco discount
department stores.
   Woolco, which became too big, too fast and whose growth took
place without direction, would become ``the company's major
weakness,'' the late Chairman Edward F. Gibbons once said.
   The division rang up $2.1 billion of the corporation's $7.2
billion in sales in 1981, but Woolco had to keep borrowing to
support its sales growth and ultimately failed to make any money.
   By 1983 Woolworth had closed all 336 Woolco stores in the United
States. It sold its majority interest in its British subsidiary and
took a $435 million after-tax writeoff.
   ``They bit the bullet and ever since they have done a superb job
of turning things around,'' said Stewart Spector, a vice president
at Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney. Getting rid of Woolco ``is
what did it,'' he noted.
   The comeback was remarkable, analysts agree. Woolworth quickly
began spending hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade its
stores and product line, even though it still remains a
merchandiser of lower-priced goods.
   ``During Woolco, the U.S. variety stores were starved for
attention in capital,'' Woolworth's Carroll said. To date more than
400 stores have been refurbished.
   Today, Woolworth has 1,695 general merchandise stores and 4,614
specialty stores, which include Kinney Shoes, Foot Locker and Lady
Foot Locker athletic shops, Kids Mart, Afterthoughts, and Richman
Brothers Co.
   For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Woolworth reported profits of
$251 million on sales of $7.1 billion. In the previous year, the
company reported net income of $214 million on sales of $6.5
billion.
   The company opened the first of a new down-sized unit called
Woolworth Express in Flint, Mich., last fall. The convenience-type
store is a prototype for 15 others expected to be completed this
year.
   Similarly, the Haft's Dart Group, established as a
Washington-area discount drug chain in the 1950s, made its mark as
a discounter. But industry analysts see the company these days more
as a predator than a retailing competitor.
   After several takeover attempts, the Hafts have yet to purchase
a single store, although they have made hundreds of millions of
dollars from payments and profits on their stock holdings in
companies they have attempted to take over.
   Those include Dayton Hudson Corp., Supermarkets General Corp.,
Safeway Stores Inc. and most recently, Stop & Shop Cos.
   One analyst noted that the Hafts have made more money as losers
than many raiders make as winners.

   The stock market lost ground today, faced with
rising interest rates and renewed uncertainties about
stronger-than-expected economic statistics.
   A big chunk of the day's activity stemmed from trading
strategies in a few high-yielding stocks based on their impending
dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said, stocks and bonds were giving a cool
response to the Labor Department's report that payroll employment
continued to grow at an unexpectedly fast pace in March, expanding
by 262,000.
   The figures were issued on Friday, when the markets were closed
for the Easter and Passover holidays.
   In the first bond-market trading since then, interest rates rose
today. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $10 for
each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the neighborhood
of 8.9 percent.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds J.C. Penney Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday upheld J.C.
Penney Co.'s defense of a company policy which permits medical and
dental insurance coverage of a Penney employee's spouse only if the
spouse earns less than the employee.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled 2-1 that the ``head of household'' provision of Penney's
insurance plan is lawful under Title VII of the federal Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
   The appeals court's majority ruled that the requirement is legal
because it is not sex-based, but is instead conditioned on a ``head
of household'' status.
   The court ruled against the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, which argued that the policy amounts to unequal
treatment of Penney's female employees and was therefore illegal
discrimination based on an employee's sex.
   U.S. District Judge Robert DeMascio in Detroit ruled at trial
that the policy did have an unequal impact on female employees, but
he said the EEOC had not proven that J.C. Penney Co. had a
discriminatory motive in adopting the requirement.
   The appeals court's majority ruled that DeMascio correctly
dismissed the EEOC's complaint because Penney's policy does not
violate federal civil rights law.
   The appellate majority found that Penney adopted the head of
household requirement in order to provide spouse insurance only for
employees who most needed the coverage _ those without more highly
paid spouses. The requirement also is an efficient administrative
tool for avoiding providing coverage of spouses most likely to have
coverage from their own employers, the appeals court's majority
said.
   ``This is a legitimate business justification for choosing this
method of supplying an insurance coverage benefit,'' the majority
ruled in an opinion written by appeals Judge Danny Boggs.
   In a minority dissent, Judge Douglas Hillman said he would have
reversed DeMascio's ruling. Hillman said he did not find Penney's
defense of its insurance coverage policy legitimate.
   ``Title VII's prohibition against compensation practices that
discriminate against women employees does not vary with the type of
compensation chosen by the employer,'' Hillman wrote.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Ordered To Pay $192 Million in Bhopal Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. said Monday it would
study a decision by a court in India before deciding whether to
appeal the court's order to pay $192 million in interim relief for
victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
   But Carbide said from its headquarters in Danbury that the
ruling by the High Court in the central Indian state of Madhya
Pradesh ``will not serve the real needs of the Bhopal victims.''
   ``The high court judge is holding Union Carbide liable and this
can only result in additional litigation while the genuine victims
remain in the wings,'' said Robert M. Berzok, a Carbide spokesman.
   The court ruled Monday on Carbide's appeal of an earlier
decision in which a district judge ordered an interim relief
payment of $270 million. Union Carbide had argued that the interim
relief could prejudice a decision in the Indian government's $3
billion suit against the company.
   The ruling by the Madhya Pradesh court, which can be appealed to
India's Supreme Court, reduced the size of the interim award by $78
million and ordered Carbide to deposit the sum within two months.
   High Court Judge S.K. Seth said he made the reduction after
considering ``the needs of the victims.''
   Berzok said Carbide has about $192 million in insurance to cover
an interim relief payment.
   ``The fact that the court reduced the amount to Union Carbide
Corp.'s insurance coverage does not change the basic failure to
provide a trial showing the cause of the tragedy and the real
extent of the damages,'' Berzok said.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Union Carbide common
stock slipped 50 cents a share to $22.75.
   One analyst said Monday's ruling ``doesn't mean too much'' to
Carbide.
   James Wilbur, who follows Carbide for the investment firm Smith,
Barney, Harris, Upham and Co., said Carbide will probably appeal to
the Supreme Court.
   He said even if the Supreme Court rules against Carbide, Indian
authorities ``have to get approval from a U.S. court in order for
funds to be paid.''
   He said Carbide and the Indian government agreed before the
court proceedings began that a U.S. court would have the authority
to approve any final decision reached in India.
   The leak of toxic gas on Dec. 3, 1984, came from a pesticide
plant run by a company subsidiary, Union Carbide of India. It was
the world's worst industrial disaster, killing more than 2,800
people and injuring at least 20,000 around the plant in Bhopal,
capital of Madhya Pradesh.
   The Indian government sued Union Carbide in September 1986,
contending the leak was caused by negligence. The company has said
it resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee.

<HEAD>Company Approaches Farmers' Stockholders Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc. approached stockholders of
Farmers Group Inc. on Monday with a proposal hinting at a possible
increase in the $63 per share bid for the nation's seventh largest
insurer.
   Batus said it would consider paying more ``in a friendly
transaction supported by the board of Farmers Group.''
   Batus has been trying since January to win control of the Los
Angeles company, but its directors have refused to negotiate with
Batus, the American subsidiary of the London-based BAT Industries
Inc. PLC.
   ``We saw their full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal and there
will be no comment,'' said Tom Welch, director of corporate
investments for Farmers.
   Wall Street reacted to the latest move by sending Farmers' stock
up 62{ cents per share to $59.62{ per share in over-the-counter
trading. Batus shares closed down 25 cents per share at $7.75 per
share on the American Stock Exchange.
   Batus, which also made its appeal by mail, accused Farmers'
board of failing to tell shareholders what would happen to the
price of their stock if Batus' $4.5 billion offer was defeated.
   The letter said the board has not offered any firm proposal
``designed to provide you with $63 or more for your stock. Instead
of writing to you, the board set forth its opinion that the company
should maintain its existence as an independent corporation.''
   Batus further charged the directors had been talking with a
third party about a possible leveraged buyout of the company.
   ``Don't you think it strange that they have failed to contact
Batus, the only company that has made a public offer for their
shares?'' Batus asked the stockholders.
   Batus described its current bid as a 47 percent premium over the
$43 market price just before the merger was proposed.
   Batus first approached stockholders last month, seeking proxies
in support of a non-binding resolution it intends to present at
Farmers' annual meeting May 20.
   The resolution would give stockholders an opportunity to express
their support for the sale and encourage Farmers' board to
facilitate such a sale, Batus said.
   Nine states would have to approve any takeover, said Gene
Russell, manager of communications for Batus.
   The California insurance commissioner has scheduled public
hearings May 4-6, with a decision expected by May 13, and the
Kansas Insurance Department has set up a hearing on proxy
solicitation on April 20. Earlier, the department reported that the
proxy solicitation might be illegal and may have to be halted.
   Farmers also operates in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Ohio, Oregon,
Texas and Washington.
   Russell said Monday that Batus was successful in challenging a
19-year-old Nevada law allowing stockholders only 60 days to decide
whether to take advantage of a tender offer from a hostile or
friendly bidder.
   A federal judge ruled the Nevada Takeover Act violates both the
supremacy and the commerce clauses of the Constitution and ordered
Nevada not to enforce it.
   The challenge was heard in Nevada because Farmers is incorported
there.
   Batus has extended the expiration date of its bid to April 27
and announced that as of March 29, approximately 3,570,000 shares
had been tendered.
   Batus owns tobacco, retailing and paper goods companies in the
United States, including Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., Saks
Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's.
   Farmers, with about $11 billion in assets, is the nation's third
largest home and auto insurer and the seventh largest property and
casualty insurer.

   The dollar recovered Monday in lackluster
trading, finishing mixed against foreign currencies after opening
the session in Asia at a three-month low against the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices rose in quiet dealings. Republic National Bank of
New York said gold was bid at $455.85 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up from $454 late Thursday. Gold trading was halted on Good
Friday.
   Activity was quelled by a long Easter holiday in Europe that
kept financial markets there closed on Monday. Most European
centers also were closed on Good Friday.
   Gold wasn't traded in London, Zurich or Hong Kong on either
Monday or Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.85 yen, down 0.25 yen from
Friday's close of 124.10 yen. The closing figure was up from
Monday's opening of 123.70 yen, its lowest opening level since Jan.
5.
   Later, in New York, the dollar rose to 124.18 yen from 123.90
late Friday. ``There was nothing to motivate the market
particularly, though the market sentiment was not to buy dollars,''
said Hiraki Abe, an analyst with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Abe said the Bank of Japan was believed to have stepped into the
market to a moderate degree to prop up the dollar. Later, in
American trading, Rod Fowler of Wood Gundy Inc. in Toronto said the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York might have stepped in to buy
dollars.
   The British pound fell to $1.8857 in late New York trading from
$1.8905 late Friday. The pound's close of $1.8895 in London Friday
had been a six-year high for sterling.

with late rates Friday, included: 1.6540 West German marks, down
from 1.6555; 1.3639 Swiss francs, down from 1.3643; 1.2370 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2346; and 5.6085 French francs, down from

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Dips in March, Conference Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence dipped slightly in March
amid concern about unemployment, according to a survey released
Monday.
   The Conference Board reported that its Consumer Confidence Index
slipped to 112.8 from 114.9 last month. The index has a 1985 base
of 100.
   ``Despite recently favorable employment figures reported by
Washington, virtually all of the decline in consumer confidence was
due to growing concern about jobs,'' said Fabian Linden, an
economist with the business research organization.
   The Conference Board said consumers are confident about general
business conditions, but 29 percent of the survey's respondents
said jobs were plentiful, down from 31 percent in February.
   ``It is too early to tell whether this is a temporary aberration
or if consumers know something the U.S. Labor Department has yet to
learn,'' Linden said.
   The government reported last week that unemployment declined to
5.6 percent in March, largely because of a drop in the total work
force.
   The Conference Board survey questioned 5,000 households across
the country. It was conducted by National Family Opinion Inc. of
Toledo, Ohio.

<HEAD>Moore McCormack To Meet On Offers, Recapitalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moore McCormack Resources, Inc., the target of a
$512 million takeover bid from Southdown Inc., said its board will
meet Tuesday to consider the offer and any other proposals it may
receive.
   In a statement Monday, Moore McCormack acknowledged it is
``engaged in negotiations concerning the acquisition of the entire
company.''
   The Stamford, Conn.-based cement and energy company said it has
provided ``certain third parties including Southdown'' the terms
under which it would agree to be acquired.
   Houston-based Southdown, which initially offered $35 a share for
Moore McCormack, sweetened its bid in late March a day after Moore
McCormack unveiled a defensive recapitalization plan.
   Southdown's latest offer would pay $35 in cash plus debt
securities valued at $5 for each of Moore McCormack's 12.8 million
common shares outstanding, an indicated total value of $512
million. Southdown also has offered to acquire Moore McCormack
preferred stock and subordinated debt.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Moore McCormack rose
$1.125 to close at $40.50 a share.
   Under terms of Moore McCormack's recapitalization plan, the
company would borrow up to $420 million and sell assets to finance
a special dividend to shareholders of $24.60 per share in cash and
debt securities with a face value of $6.62 per share.
   Moore McCormack said in a statement that in addition to
reviewing any acquisition proposals it may receive, its directors
also would consider whether to proceed with the recapitalization
plan.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices tumbled Monday and interest rates
leapt as the U.S. credit market got its first chance to respond to
last week's report on March unemployment.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 1\ points, or
$12.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, had soared to 8.86 percent from 8.75
percent late Thursday.
   The credit markets were closed Friday in observance of the Good
Friday and Passover holidays.
   Analysts said bond traders saw the government's latest
unemployment report as evidence that the economy may be heating up
and inflation may accelerate.
   The Labor Department said last Friday that the U.S. unemployment
fell to 5.6 percent in March, while nonfarm payroll employment rose
by a larger-than-expected 262,000 jobs.
   Bond investors took the news as a cue to sell bonds because
resilience in the economy could signal a resurgence of inflation,
which erodes bond values.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for
the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the report also
``dims any prospects of Fed easing or lower interest rates in the
near term.''
   If the economy bounces too strongly, the Federal Reserve could
put a lid on expansion by raising interest rates, which would push
bond prices lower.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department auctioned $12.8 billion in
short-term securities at the highest rates since mid-January.
   The government sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills at an
average discount rate of 5.98 percent, up from 5.69 percent last
week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.21 percent, up from 6.0 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since Jan. 19 when three-month bills
sold for an identical 5.98 percent and six-month bills averaged
6.37 percent.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages was 6.78 percent
last week, up from 6.77 percent the previous week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell ] point from last Thursday, intermediate
maturities dropped 18-32 point to } point, and long-term issues
tumbled 25-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, had tumbled 6.66 to 1,161.92. The Merrill Lynch
composite index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.62 to
111.10.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, lost 1.86 at 279.18.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, jumped 13 basis
points to 5.85 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills had soared 19 basis points to
6.22 percent and one-year bills leaped 18 basis points to 6.54
percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 611-16 percent, down from 6} percent late
Thursday.

   The stock market posted a broad loss Monday,
faced with rising interest rates and renewed uncertainties about
stronger-than-expected economic statistics.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.46 to 1,980.60.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 458 up, 1,106 down and 407 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 182.24 million shares, against 139.87
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index fell
1.43 to 145.17.
   A big chunk of the activity stemmed from trading strategies in a
few high-yielding stocks based on their impending dividend payments.
   The Dow Jones industrial average would have shown a considerably
wider loss but for the preformance of one of its components _ F.W.
Woolworth, which jumped 8~ to 54[. The company said it had received
notice that a group headed by Herbert Haft was seeking regulatory
approval to buy up to 15 percent of its stock.
   Otherwise, analysts said, stocks and bonds were giving a cool
response to the Labor Department's report that payroll employment
continued to grow at an unexpectedly fast pace in March, expanding
by 262,000.
   The figures were issued on Friday, when the markets were closed
for the Easter and Passover holidays.
   In the first bond-market trading since then, interest rates rose
today. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $10 for
each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the neighborhood
of 8.9 percent.
   As for stocks, said Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton,
``we are dealing with a market that has been on the defensive for
most of the past two weeks.
   Issues that were caught up in dividend-related trading included
Bell South, down { at 38\ on more than 31 million shares; Carolina
Power & Light, down [ at 33~ on more than 17 million shares, and
Delmarva Power & Light, up [ at 17~ on more than 5 million shares.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down [ at 107{; Exxon, down } at 41\, and American
Telephone & Telegraph, down ] at 26|.
   Oxford First climbed 3 to 21\. It said it was negotiating with
the privately held CAWSL Corp. of Winnewood, Pa., on a possible
sale at about $25 a share.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 209.23 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $25.16 billion, or 0.97
percent, in value.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 3.24 to 297.15,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.80 at 256.09.

<HEAD>Torrington Co. Files Anti-Dumping Petitions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrington Co. has filed petitions with
the federal government charging that foreign manufacturers are
dumping anti-friction bearings in the United States and hurting
domestic manufacturers.
   Torrington, the largest broad-line bearing maker in the United
States and a subsidary of Ingersoll-Rand, filed anti-dumping and
countervailing duty petitions last week against a number of
European and Asian nations exporting anti-friction bearings to the
United States.
   Countries named in the unfair trade petitions are Japan, West
Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Singapore,
Thailand and Romania.
   Imports of bearings covered by petitions amounted to roughly
$500 million in 1987. The petitions claim that the ``dumping'' had
reached significant levls, with foreign manufacturers selling
bearings in the United States at prices as low as half their fair
market value.
   ``Torrington is committed to taking positive action to stop the
dumping of bearings in the U.S. market,'' said Thomas E. Bennett,
company president. ``Our industry continues, unnecessarily, to be
the victim of unfairly low pricing by many of our foreign
competitors.
   ``These unfair trade petitions are intended to neutralize the
dumping and subsidization that have distorted conditions of
competition in the United States market.''
   The company's petitions were filed last Thursday with the
International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce,
the two government agencies responsible for investigating charges
of unfair trade practices.
   Preliminary findings are anticipated from the International
Trade Commission by mid-May and from the Commerce Department
sometime between late June and late fall.
   Dwight Keeney, a company spokesman, said government figures
indicate that from 1980 to 1985, employment in the domestic
bearings industry declined 24.7 percent, from 52,600 to 39,600.
   Loss of production jobs in the industy for the same period was
26.5 percent, from 42,300 jobs in 1980 to 31,100 jobs in 1985.
Keeney said the decline continues.

<HEAD>Belzberg Firm Agrees to Pay $400,000 Fine in Ashland Stock Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A holding company controlled by the Belzberg
family of Canada has agreed to pay a $400,000 fine to settle a
lawsuit charging its 1986 purchase of Ashland Oil Co. stock
violated an anti-takeover law.
   The settlement between the Federal Trade Commission and First
City Financial Corp. Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, was made
public in court papers filed last week in U.S. District Court here.
   The FTC charged in a lawsuit filed Friday along with the
proposed settlement that First City violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino
antitrust law by failing to notify the government of Ashland stock
purchases exceeding $15 million.
   The complaint charged that First City and its parent, Roxboro
Investments Ltd., had also violated the law by continuing to
purchase more than a $15 million stake in Ashland without notifying
the FTC and observing a 30-day waiting period.
   First City said in a statement it ``did not violate the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act'' but ``agreed to settle to avoid the expense
of singlehandedly litigating a longstanding interpretive dispute
between the FTC and the investment community.''
   The settlement must be given final approval by U.S. District
Judge John H. Pratt.
   The oil company's stock rose 10 percent following a March 25,
1986 announcement that the Belzbergs had acquired 9.2 percent of
Ashland stock and offered to pay $60 a share to buy a controlling
interest in the Kentucky-based refining company.
   On April 2, 1986, the Belzberg companies sold their 9.2 percent
stake in Ashland for $134.1 million under an agreement with the oil
company.
   First City is also a defendant in a parallel action brought in
federal court here by the Securities and Exchange Commission
arising from the transaction.
   The SEC suit charges that First City arranged for its brokerage
house, Bear, Stearns & Co., to buy and hold shares of Ashland stock
so that the Canadian firm could avoid the pre-merger notifcation
requirements.
   First City has denied there was any understanding with Bear,
Stearns.

<HEAD>Soybean Market Soars On Bullish USDA Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bullish government reports indicating soybean supplies may be
tighter than expected this year sent soybean futures prices soaring
in trading Monday at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   In other markets, where trading was often volatile, grain prices
were mostly higher; precious metals rallied; cattle prices were
mostly lower, the pork complex was mixed; energy prices were mostly
lower; and stock-index futures were mostly lower.
   Reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, released after
Thursday's pre-holiday trading session, sparked a wave of buying in
soybeans. Bean prices hit new contract highs before a wave of
profit-taking late in the session offset earlier advances.
   The USDA annual report on farmers' spring planting intentions
predicted about a 1 percent increase in soybean acreage to 57.9
million acres _ well below the estimate of 59.1 million acres.
   The department's quarterly grain stocks report estimated
soybeans at almost 1.15 billion bushels as of March 1, slightly
below the pre-report estimate.
   Buying in new crop corn for delivery in deferred months was
sparked by the report showing spring planting intentions at 66.9
million acres, up 2 percent from last year but well below
expectations, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   But more bearish news came from the corn stocks estimate of 7.6
billion bushels, slightly above estimates.
   Wheat prices rose ``in sympathy with strength in the beans,''
Lespinasse said.
   Wheat settled } cent to 3 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.00\ a bushel; corn settled 1 cent lower to 3\
cents higher, with May at $2.08} a bushel; oats settled 2{ cents to
4} cents higher with May at $1.64 a bushel; and soybeans settled
15\ cents to 17} cents higher, with May at $6.68} a bushel.
   Volatility marked trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
cattle and hogs, which advanced sharply early in the session on
optimism stemming from the USDA's quarterly hog and pig report
released Thursday, but plummeted on late profit-taking and other
technical factors, analysts said.
   The report put the hog and pig count in states that account for
80 percent of U.S. production at about 40.5 million head as of
March 1. Though the 6 percent increase over last year met analysts'
expectations, the report indicated smaller increases in hog herd
expansion than anticipated, analysts said.
   Philip Stanley, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
in Chicago said there were no outside influences to explain the
markets' sharp sell-off late in the session.
   Live cattle prices settled unchanged to 1.45 cents lower, with
the contract for delivery in April at 73.62 cents a pound; feeder
cattle settled 1.15 cents to 1.50 cents lower with April at 79.40
cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent lower to 1.32 cents higher, with
April at 45.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.12
cents lower to 1.85 cents higher, with May at 55 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices rallied in topsy-turvy trading at
the New York Commodity Exchange.
   Early gains were sparked by the U.S. dollar's weak performance
and fears of an inflationary trend stemming from Friday's report of
a 5.6 percent jobless rate in March, the lowest in nine years, said
Jack Barbanel, director of the futures trading division at Gruntal
& Co. in New York.
   But while the market closed up, ``Gains by the end of the day
evaporated on profit-taking,'' he said.
   Gold settled $1.60 to $2.80 higher, with the contract for
delivery in April at $456.70 a troy ounce; while silver settled 3.4
cents to 7.7 cents higher, with April at $6.789 a troy ounce.
   Cotton futures fell Monday in volatile trading at the New York
Cotton Exchange.
   Prices rallied early in the session on the USDA's prospetive
plantings report for cotton in 1988, which ``came out a little
below expectations,'' said Ernest Simon, a cotton specialist in New
York with Prudential-Bache Securities.
   But the report still indicated a good-sized crop, and prices
dropped sharply later in the session, Simon said.
   Cotton prices settled .75 cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at 60.88 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices were mostly lower in quiet trading at the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil settled unchanged to 8 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in April at $16.41 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
to .27 cent lower, with May at 46 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline settled .03 cent to .21 cent lower, with May at 49.35
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.10 points lower at 256.95.

<HEAD>Bank Board Changes Calculation of Thrift Capital Requirments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced
Monday it was revising the way it calculates the required capital
levels that must be met by the country's savings and loan
associations.
   The bank board has set a goal of boosting the minimum capital
requirement for S&Ls eventually to 6 percent of assets, up from an
initial 3 percent level set last year.
   The rule change announced Monday affects the calculation used to
determine how much the capital requirement will be boosted each
year.
   Officials said the change was required because the old
calculation method would have resulted in the minimum capital
requirement declining this year, reflecting the record $6.8 billion
that federally insured S&Ls lost in 1987.
   The old process involved adding up total industry earnings and
dividing by total assets. Under the new procedure, the
profitability of each S&L will be determined and then a mid-point
level will be selected and that figure will be used to set the
increase in capital which will be required.
   Brian Smith, director of regulatory affairs for the U.S. League
of Savings Institutions, said the industry had no objection to the
change.
   ``We understand that average earnings results were very
distorted,'' he said. ``For the bulk of the business that is not
doing too badly, this makes sense.''
   The bank board gave no estimate of what the new minimum capital
requirement will be, but Smith estimated it could rise to around
3.4 percent. The new capital requirement will take effect for the
quarter beginning on July 1.
   Use of the new rule will reduce the time required to reach the 6
percent requirement to less than 12 years, the bank board said, as
opposed to an estimated 40 years using the old process.
   The change on capital requirements followed a decision last
Friday by the bank board to prevent a planned drop in the special
assessments being levied on S&Ls.
   The board voted to continue the special assessment rate of
1-32nd of 1 percent of insured deposits for the first quarter of
1988. That is added to the one-twelfth of 1 percent that is
collected from both banks and S&Ls as the standard fee for insuring
individual deposits up to a maximum of $100,000.
   Congress last year, in passing a measured aimed at bailing at
the insolvent S&L insurance fund, had called for the surcharge to
begin declining unless the bank board blocked the drop in
assessments.
   For the past two quarters, the bank board has vetoed any
assessment decline. Officials justify the action on the grounds
that growing losses at S&Ls prevent any move to allow the
assessment to decline.
   However, the U.S. League, the industry's biggest lobbying group,
attacked that decision saying that it ``flies in the face of the
understanding between savings institutions and the administration''
made last summer when Congress authorized the assessments.
   The bank board has said it will announce sometime this week a
proposed plan for a new variable assessment program that would free
the best-capitalized S&Ls from paying the surcharge.
   This proposal is aimed at keeping healthy savings and loans from
leaving the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
insures S&Ls, for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
insures banks and has no surcharge.
   Such shifts will be permitted after Aug. 10 unless Congress
decides to block them. While S&Ls which decided to make the move
would be charged an exit fee, they would be able to earn that money
back in only a few years through the lower insurance costs.

   Ben & Jerry, those irrepressible Vermont
ice-cream makers, conceded Monday that it may be easier to make
Coffee Heath Bar Crunch than to make a New York subway station
shine.
   It was about a year ago that Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield,
whose Ben & Jerry's ice cream has become a favorite of the upscale
ice cream set, proposed to spruce up and maintain a subway station
in Manhattan. The company is based in Waterbury, Vt.
   Their choice was the 72nd Street IRT station, which Cohen, just
down from Vermont, found ``really disgusting.'' Most New Yorkers
would say it's better than most, but that's another story.
   Cohen and Greenfield offered to spend their entire New York
advertising budget for the year _ $200,000 to $250,000 _ cleaning,
painting and maintaining the station.
   The Transit Authority said yes. The Transport Workers Union said
no.
   The problem was that Ben & Jerry wanted to use some non-union
workers on the project. ``Our position,'' said union spokesman Jim
Gannon, ``is that we'll cooperate but the people who do the work
have to be TA employees.''
   Negotiations dragged on and Ben & Jerry finally set a March 31
deadline. That passed too; the matter went before an independent
arbitrator who is expected to rule soon.
   So on Monday, Ben & Jerry set up an ice cream wagon and a van at
a park across the street from the subway station and began doling
out free ice cream to anyone who wanted it. It was supposed to be a
consolation prize for subway passengers emerging from the filthy
station. Ben & Jerry were there to promise that they'd keep trying
to spruce it up.
   Nobody seemed to care about the station, though _ not while
there was free ice cream to be had.
   ``I love the fact that the homeless people keep going back for
seconds,'' mused Ben & Jerry's sales and marketing director, Allan
Kaufman.
   ``It doesn't look like they're getting the message,'' said Ben,
breaking into gales of laughter.
   ``It's OK with me,'' said Jerry.

<HEAD>IBM Confirms Private Offers Of Chips To Other Companies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs headline and 1st graf to change description of offers

   International Business Machines Corp. confirmed
Monday it has been privately offering to sell computer chips to
other companies for about two years.
   But IBM denied that its aim was to prevent the U.S. electronics
industry from becoming overly dependent on Japanese chip suppliers.
Instead, it said, it was trying to test the quality of its own
chips by seeing if anyone else would want to buy them.
   IBM is the world's largest maker of semiconductors but consumes
almost all of its own output. The company said it never had the
intention of entering the merchant chip market on a large scale.
   It said it had offered ``limited quantities of semiconductors to
a very small number of companies internationally.'' It declined to
confirm it had actually made any sales.
   ``The goal is to sharpen ourselves competitively by having these
companies (customers) assess price, function and performance
against the best chips in the world available from other vendors,
which of course includes the Japanese,'' IBM spokesman Peter Thonis
said.
   The first report that IBM had offered to sell chips to
competitors came last month in a new book, ``Trading Places: How We
Allowed Japan to Take the Lead,'' by Clyde Prestowitz, formerly the
Commerce Department's chief trade negotiator.
   Details were reported Monday by the New York Times, based on
anonymous sources and an interview with Jack Kuehler, an IBM vice
chairman.
   The offers were apparently kept undisclosed at the request of
the potential customers, which did not want it known that they were
considering buying chips from IBM.
   ``Testing of chips in actual business conditions provides the
best gauge of how IBM's technology stacks up,'' Thonis said Monday.
``In some cases we found we were not as competitive, and in those
instances we've worked to correct it. In other areas we found we
were true industry leaders.''
   IBM said it was offering only its chips, not its underlying
designs or process technology. It declined to comment on how many
companies had bought chips, if any; the value of the purchases; or
the names of any customers.
   IBM would have to increase its chip production vastly to become
an important alternative source of chips for U.S. or European
electronics companies, and the company said it did not have that in
mind.
   ``We're neither accepting orders for semiconductors nor
increasing capacity,'' Thonis said.
   IBM officials have said the company's own health depends on
maintaining a strong domestic ability to produce chips, training a
large number of microelectronic engineers and sustaining a strong
semiconductor equipment manufacturing business so IBM will not need
to depend on Japan for the most up-to-date technology.
   Along those lines, IBM has been a major backer of Sematech, the
industry-government project to improve the quality of chip
manufacturing technology in the United States.
   In his book, Prestowitz said Digital Equipment Corp., IBM's
biggest rival, was one of the companies that held talks with IBM on
chip purchases. Digital's president, Kenneth Olsen, seemed to
confirm that in a New York Times interview.
   But Mark Fredrickson, a Digital spokesman, said Monday the
company could not confirm the discussions. He also denied
suggestions that Digital was in danger of becoming overly dependent
on Japanese chips.
   ``We think that the amount of value we add from capabilities
within our own organization is so pervasive that to suggest that
there is a dangerous dependence on anyone from outside doesn't make
sense,'' Fredrickson said.

<HEAD>Irving Sues Bank Of New York; Makes Earnings Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. predicted Monday that it would
earn a profit of more than $200 million in 1988, and it urged
shareholders again to reject as inadequate Bank of New York's
hostile $1.08 billion tender bid.
   Meanwhile, the banking concern said it filed a lawsuit in state
court attempting to block a proxy solicitation of Bank of New York,
which began its tender offer last month and is seeking to gain
control of Irving's board of directors.
   In a letter to shareholders sent over the weekend, Irving
forecast 1988 net income of $234 million, or about $11.78 a share,
on revenue of $1.14 billion.
   Last year, Irving reported a loss of $193.3 million, compared
with a net profit of $128.1 million, or $6.83, in 1986, largely due
to its increased loan-loss provision to cover shaky Third World
debt.
   Irving attributed the projected improvement, in part, to
continued strong performance in its domestic and community banking
businesses.
   ``Your company is performing in line with the 1988 forecast
based on the results of the first two months of 1988,'' the letter
said. ``Book value per share is projected to increase to
approximately $50 from $40.91 at Dec. 31, 1987.
   ``Bank of New York's offer ... represents a multiple of only 1.2
times Irving's forecasted book value,'' it said.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said, ``We don't know the
basis on which the calculated projections were made. We can't make
a meaningful comment.''
   Bank of New York's current offer _ of $15 in cash and 1.575
shares of its own stock for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 common
shares outstanding _ has been denounced as inadequate by Irving's
board.
   Last month, Bank of New York began its tender offer after
receiving the go-ahead from the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and the company assembled a slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board.
Bank of New York currently holds a 4.83 percent stake in Irving.
   Irving has repeatedly stressed its desire to remain independent
and has taken a number of steps to spurn Bank of New York's
advances, including instituting an anti-takeover ``poison pill,''
intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive.
   Irving's lawsuit, filed in state court, seeks damages in excess
of about $350 million.
   It claims that Bank of New York's proxy material is false and
misleading, particularly in the way it valued Irving's portfolio of
Third World debt. Irving claimed the portfolio was overstated by
about $208 million.
   The suit was filed late last week and mentioned in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, said David Santos, an
Irving spokesman.
   Brady called the suit ``without merit,'' and said the banking
concern would seek a dismissal.
