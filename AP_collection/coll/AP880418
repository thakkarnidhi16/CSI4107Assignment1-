<HEAD>Power Blackout Hits Quebec Province</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New info and changes throughout</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widespread power failure Monday night blacked
out Quebec and parts of New Brunswick province, affecting millions
of people including some in scattered districts in Maine and
Vermont.
   Hydro Quebec, the provincial power utility, said the power
outage began at 8:09 p.m. EDT.
   Among the blackout victims was television coverage of the Adams
Division final game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Boston
Bruins of the National Hockey League. The game at the Montreal
Forum was interrupted in the first period but then continued with
the use of emergency lights. Montreal won 5-2.
   Hydro Quebec spokesman Jean-Guy Ouimet said the breakdown began
on a power line between Churchill Falls, Labrador, and the Arnaud
generating station near Sept-Iles, Quebec, but the cause was was
not known.
   ``The problem came from the Churchill Falls power house. For
some reason the power stopped coming'' and that caused an overload
on other lines, he said.
   Power was being restored in one area at a time, he added.
   Cities on the New York side of the border were not affected
because the state does not operate on the same system, according to
a spokesman for New York State Electric and Gas.
   In Montreal, street lights and traffic signals blinked out and
passengers were rescued from stalled subway trains. Hospitals used
emergency generating systems and said there were no serious
problems.
   Police reported no looting or other disturbances, but the armed
forces said military police patrols were reinforced at armories.
   Hydro Quebec and Bell Canada officials pleaded with people not
to use the strained telephone system, but many radio stations lost
their transmitting facilities and were unable to broadcast the
appeals.
   Gerry Morris, an official with the Vermont Electric Cooperative,
said about 800 homes in the Canaan and Norton areas were blacked
out for about an hour.
   The sale of Canadian hydropower to New England and New York has
become an important part of Quebec province's economy.

   Polls gave the lead to Gov. Michael Dukakis in
the last campaign day before New York's Democratic presidential
primary, but Jesse Jackson was within striking distance and turnout
was considered critical.
   While Dukakis led by 10 or more points, pollsters said to watch
the turnout Tuesday, particularly among non-Jewish whites, a
potential swing vote. If many stayed home, they said, Jackson could
come from behind.
   ``Nobody can predict for sure what the final combination of
blacks, Jews, Hispanics and white Catholics will be,'' said ABC
News pollster John Brennan. ``We could all be wrong. New York is a
killer.''
   Polling Monday by ABC and the Washington Post found Dukakis
holding the ground he gained Sunday after a dip Friday and
Saturday, while Jackson slid a bit. The combined Sunday-Monday
results gave Dukakis 51 percent and Jackson 34. The Friday-Saturday
totals had been 46-40.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 9 percent in the final
ABC-Post poll, down from 11 percent Friday and Saturday.
   A CBS News survey Saturday and Sunday had a slightly narrower
spread, with Dukakis at 43 percent, Jackson at 33 and Gore at 12. A
Gallup poll done Friday through Sunday put the race at Dukakis 45,
Jackson 32 and Gore 10.
   The ABC-Post poll had a 6-point margin of error, CBS's 4,
Gallup's 5.
   Pollsters said Gore, after an upward blip late last week,
settled back to his previous, comparatively low level of support
and did not seem likely to draw enough votes to affect the outcome
greatly. Gore was up slightly in the CBS poll but down a tick in
the ABC-Post and Gallup polls.
   ``Gore does not appear to have gotten into the numbers where he
will close the margin,'' said Lee Miringoff, chief of the Marist
College Institute for Public Opinion. ``That leaves the next level
of analysis: Turnout.''
   Jews, who can make up roughly 25 percent of New York's primary
vote, strongly favored Dukakis; blacks, who can make up about the
same proportion of the vote, backed Jackson overwhelmingly. Jackson
had roughly 20 percent of the non-Jewish white vote, the ABC-Post
poll said.
   ``Jackson is not getting enough whites. He needs a large black
turnout and low white ethnic turnout to close what is a
moderate-size Dukakis lead at this point,'' Miringoff said. ``White
ethnics are solidly behind Dukakis. The question is whether they go
and vote.''
   The ABC-Post and CBS polls said Jackson's supporters were
significantly more committed to their candidate than were Dukakis'
backers. Miringoff said analyses of only the most likely voters
narrowed Dukakis' lead.
   But in New York, even when black voters are committed to a
candidate, ``even in the best of times that doesn't mean as good a
turnout as the Jewish turnout,'' said CBS poll chief Warren
Mitofsky. ``The Jewish vote always turns out.''
   It remained to be seen if Dukakis would retain that vote,
Mitofsky said. Moreover, he noted that a CBS poll late last week
said as many as one-fifth of the voters had not decided _ making
the candidates' final efforts, on the stump and in advertising,
particularly important. Even the CBS poll that was completed Sunday
night said 9 percent remained undecided.
   ``I'd take these last few days very seriously,'' Mitofsky said.
   The ABC-Post poll, which presses respondents to make a choice,
had only 3 percent undecided. ``The biggest group of wafflers right
now'' _ about 10 percent of the electorate _ ``is trying to decide
between Dukakis and Gore,'' said Brennan.
   There were other imponderables, including the new conflict in
the Persian Gulf. Voters could turn to Dukakis as ``a safer vote,''
Brennan conjectured, or to Jackson as a protest vote, or to Gore
because of his experience in military matters.

<DATELINE>WALPACK TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late afternoon sun casts long
shadows over the clapboard houses that line Main Street in Walpack
Center. It's dead still, but that's not unusual.
   Walpack Township is dying.
   And Walpack Center, the once-thriving hub of the community, is
nearly a ghost town, having faded year by year since the federal
government bought up the surrounding countryside to build a dam _
and then changed its mind.
   ``There seems to be no trace of what was here, like it never
happened,'' Township Clerk Virginia E. Fuller said, as she and her
husband, Mayor Raymond Fuller, settled into chairs on the
glass-enclosed front porch of their home outside Walpack Center.
   ``It was an active community,'' she recalled. ``We had a fire
department and a ladies auxilliary. We used to take the bus to the
city every now and then.
   ``It's like it was all erased,'' she added.
   ``Suits me fine,'' her husband said, trying to appear
cantankerous but breaking into booming laughter.
   Only the municipal building _ an old one-room schoolhouse _ and
the rescue squad garage are still owned by the township.
   The federal government owns the former Methodist church, which
is now locked, along with six houses and a post office that make up
the rest of Walpack Center.
   The houses all are painted the same beige with green trim,
lending an eerie quality to the silence. The post office is open
only two hours, six days a week.
   Spreading from the township center are acres of what once was
pasture. But the farmhouses, the fences and barns are long gone.
   The death knell for Walpack sounded in 1962 when Congress
authorized a plan to build a dam at Tocks Island, a few miles north
up the Delaware River. The idea was to create a 12,000-acre lake
along 37 miles of the Delaware River from Port Jervis, N.Y., to the
Delaware Water Gap.
   The federal government spent $9 million on engineering for the
proposed dam between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. An additional
$75.2 million bought land for the lake and a surrounding park. The
lake was to be used for recreation and water supply, while the dam
would provide hydroelectric power and flood control.
   But Congress never appropriated money to build the dam because
of environmental and economic objections.
   In 1978, it turned the project over from the Army Corps of
Engineers to the National Park Service, which is turning the land
and river into the 69,000-acre Delaware Water Gap National
Recreation Area.
   The federal government now owns all but about 5,000 acres of the
land it intends to incorporate into the park. That land, in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, is still privately owned.
   The Fullers, whose home is on a half-acre plot, are among about
90 residents left in Walpack Township, a 45-square-mile community
that falls entirely within the recreation area.
   The Fullers, both 62, say they intend to stay in Walpack, and
serve as mayor and clerk, as long as they are able. They won't sell
out to the government, as their neighbors did.
   ``People think we're crazy for staying, but it's great,'' Mrs.
Fuller said, gazing across a deep ravine to the pines on a far
ridge.
   The government's objective for the area is to ``provide
opportunities for outdoor recreation,'' said Richard Ring, the park
service's assistant superintendent of the area.
   ``Probably got just as much use before,'' Mrs. Fuller said.
   ``More,'' said her husband.
   But Ring says 2.5 million people visit the recreation area
annually to hunt, fish, swim, ride bikes, hike and go boating and
canoeing on the river. Officials expect the number to double in the
next decade, he said.
   To accommodate the visitors, the park service plans to set up
restrooms, picnic areas, refreshment stands, boat landings and
trails for hiking and biking.
   ``There also are a number of historic facilities that folks can
come and tour,'' Ring said.
   Among those historic facilities are homes once owned by people
like the Fullers. The buildings in Walpack Center may eventually
house country inns, craft shops, art galleries, museums,
restaurants or ``other facilities consistent with the
(government's) objectives for the area,'' Ring said.
   Thousands of other houses, that were deemed to have no historic
or cultural value, were torn down.
   ``We fought it like the devil,'' Fuller said of opposition to
the federal plans.
   Walpack, established in the 1750s, had a year-round population
of about 375 in the early 1960s, with numbers swelling to about
3,000 in the summer, the Fullers said. Most residents were dairy
farmers and most summer people came for the fishing and hunting, or
the solitude.
   ``Sometimes it's hard to remember what it was like,'' Mrs.
Fuller said.

<HEAD>The High Voltage Excitement Of Sonia Braga</HEAD>

   She never went to acting school, but Sonia
Braga has managed to convey high-voltage excitement in such films
as ``Dona Flora and Her Two Husbands'' and ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman.'' Now she's doing the same in Robert Redford's ``The Milagro
Beanfield War.''
   Braga plays Ruby, a tenacious garage owner who organizes a civic
revolt against the land marauders of a New Mexico village. It's
another remarkable performance for the actress who began her career
in Brazilian soap operas.
   Here for the opening of ``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' Braga
recently talked about her career in an interview that covered a
wide range of subjects, usually in brief bursts of conversation.
Her English is amazingly good, considering her recent acquaintance
with the language.
   ``I started learning English about four years ago,'' she said.
``I went to visit a friend in New York, and since I wasn't doing
anything at the time, ... I decided to stay and learn the language.
I'm glad that I did that. Language can be a big barrier between
people. If you want to know a people, you have to learn the
language.''
   The actress first heard about ``Milagro'' while she was serving
on the jury of the Cannes Film Festival three years ago. Her agent
told her that Robert Redford wanted to talk with her about a role
in the film. On her way home to Brazil she stopped in New York.
   ``I read the script and I really, really loved it,'' she said.
``Then I met Robert, and we talked. I was too excited about the
character to be nervous. I was very, very touched that someone
would want to make a movie about `Milagro.'
   ``Then I made a screen test three times. I had three or four
more interviews with the producers and the director. Then I went to
New Mexico.''
   In the movie, a New Mexico hamlet is being squeezed to death by
a resort developer with the help of the state governor and his
venal staff. The officials even send a hatchet man to terrorize the
residents, mostly Hispanic, when they grow restive under the rape
of their land.
   The reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner who
inadvertently diverts the land baron's water into his beanfield. He
becomes defiant, and others strive to make it a crusade, especially
Braga.
   What's it like to be directed by Robert Redford?
   ``He's very sensitive,'' Braga said. ``I think that's not only
because he's an actor and he understands the problems of actors.
That's the quality that some people have. He is very into certain
important things, like the environment.
   ``He is totally open to suggestion. If you're doing well, he'll
just let you go. For instance, Ruben Blades (who plays Sheriff
Montoya) is a natural actor. He was so much the character that
Robert just watched him do it. But when he sees that you are going
the wrong way, he leads you back to the right way for the movie. If
you have any suggestions about the character, he will listen to you
and make some changes.''
   The dark-haired beauty has been working since she was 14. After
playing children, she did a production of ``Hair'' for two years.
   ``Then I started doing soap operas,'' she said. ``One of the
soap operas, `Gabriella,' was written by Jorge Amada, who also
wrote `Dona Flor.'''
   The film brought her international acclaim, as did ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman,'' her first film in English.
   She welcomes more opportunities abroad since the Brazilian film
industry has been ailing because of the country's financial woes.
The country's major filmmakers have abandoned Brazil for Hollywood,
making movies in English instead of Portuguese. Hector Babenco
(``Kiss of the Spider Woman'') shot ``Ironweed'' with Meryl Streep
and Jack Nicholson in Albany, N.Y.

   Recent protests by blacks at predominantly white universities
differed in their immediate causes, but academic observers say the
incidents reflect increasing tensions.
   ``There is such a rawness to race relations on campus now,''
Troy Duster, a professor of sociology at the University of
California at Berkeley, said last week.
   ``A lot of black students are feeling besieged and beleaguered.
They feel that their fellow students and professors wonder why they
are there in the first place,'' he said.
   Provocations for protests have run the gamut from an assault at
the University of Massachusetts to verbal harassment at Denison
College in Ohio to a stolen bicycle in Berkeley.
   ``In every single one of these instances, there has been some
local incident or an accumulation of things ... the straw that
broke the camel's back as it were,'' said Mary Frances Berry, a
member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and Sigal professor
of history at the University of Pennsylvania.
   ``But if one looks generally, one sees that on these campuses
you have the basic sort of reaction against the expansion of
opportunity for blacks,'' she said.
   Although black college enrollment has increased by about 25,000
between 1976 and 1986, according to the U.S. Department of
Education, the proportion of blacks has declined from 9.6 percent
to 8.8 percent of the national student body, largely because of a
decline in the number of black male students.
   Whites accounted for 79 percent of the students in 1986, down
from 82 percent in 1976.
   Charles Willie, professor of education and urban affairs at
Harvard University, said the protests are based on a sense of
despair about the Reagan administration's commitment to securing
equal opportunities.
   ``When there is a belief that there are others who are acting on
one's own behalf, there is a tendency for minorities to accommodate
shortcomings and faults and abuses _ minor abuses _ on the basis
that help is on its way,'' Willie said in a telephone interview.
   ``The sense of abandonment leads to a sense of despair, and then
there is a tendency to strike out at all kinds of harm, instead of
accommodating. Where there is a sense of despair, the level of
toleration is certainly reduced.''
   Last week, Denison University banished two white students from
its Granville, Ohio, campus for the remainder of the academic year
for harassing a black student.
   The students had been found guilty of harassing Aaron Laramore,
a black senior, by pounding on the wall of his dormitory room and
yelling racial epithets.
   In other recent incidents:
   _ In Durham, N.C., about 300 people staged a protest Friday at
Duke University, saying there were not enough black faculty members
and calling the prestigious school a ``racist institution.'' Joseph
Di Bona, an associate professor in the education department, said
the shortage of black faculty members means that blacks at Duke
lead ``disembodied lives.''
   _ About 100 students marched to City Hall in Lexington, Ky., on
April 8 to protest a racial epithet used by A.B.``Happy Chandler,''
the former governor and baseball commissioner who is now a member
of the University of Kentucky's Board of Trustees. During a
discussion about investments in South Africa, Chandler had remarked
that Zimbabwe, formerly ruled by whites, is ``all nigger now.''
   _ Eighteen black students at Berkeley were cited for trespassing
April 7 following an all-day sit-in at the campus housing office by
about 50 members of the African Students Association. The protest
was spurred by one freshman's complaint that three white students
damaged her bicycle and that she had been the object of slurs and
jokes.
   ``This protest is the culmination of a lot of different things
that have gone unresolved at the university,'' said ASA President
Michael Stoll.
   _ Black students and feminists protested at the University of
Pennsylvania after an all-white fraternity staged a pornographic
show featuring two black strippers. On March 4, the university
ordered the Zeta Beta Tau house closed for at least 1{ years.
   _ In February, minority students took over a building at the
University of Massachusetts campus in Amherst after two black
students were beaten by five whites. Two of the whites dropped out
of school before disciplinary hearings were held, and two others
were put on disciplinary probation.
   _ Forty black, Hispanic and other minority students occupied a
dormiitory office at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., for nine
days endng March 2. The students won a 16-point agreement which
included the appointment of a dean of multicultural affairs and an
adviser for the student group which occupied the dorm office.
   _ Minority students at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.,
organized several rallies and a boycott of downtown stores that
advertise in The Dartmouth Review after the conservative,
off-campus weekly renewed its attacks on the competence of William
Cole, a black professor of music.
   A college disciplinary board last month suspended three Review
staffers and put a fourth on probation after they confronted Cole
in his classroom. In a March 28 speech, Dartmouth President James
Freedman said the Review is ``poisoning the intellectual
environment of our campus.''
   _ Black students organized at Georgia Southwestern College to
seek the dismissal of a professor who allegedly called a student a
``black bitch.''
   The professor said the student had accused him of being a racist
when he refused to let her withdraw with a passing grade instead of
a failing grade.
   ``We've got to do a lot more to sensitize majority populations
about the needs of minority students,'' said Tom Goodale, vice
chancellor for student affairs at University of Denver and
president of the National Association of Student Personnel
Administrators.
   Goodale said one underlying issue in recent protests is access
to higher education. Though the latest federal budget provides for
increased aid, ``the rules are more cumbersome,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   ``The other issue is continuing racism, whether that is in the
form of language or violence. The country, for whatever reason, is
in a conservative mood. Racial slurs, the predominant problem of
poverty, have brought those issues to the forefront again.''

   Vladimir Tufeld's thoughts revolve around a very
sick woman in an American hospital thousands of miles away. But his
crippled body is stuck in a two-room apartment with a 12th-floor
view of a city he no longer wants to see.
   In late December, Tufeld's wife of 35 years, Izolda, was given
permission to leave the Soviet Union to undergo brain tumor surgery
at Johns Hopkins University hospital in Baltimore, Md.
   But according to Soviet government officials, the knowledge
Tufeld gained working in an electronics factory 15 years ago still
could threaten Soviet security. Despite appeals from members of the
U.S. Congress and governments from Britain to Australia, the
distinguished-looking 60-year-old electronics engineer had to stay
behind.
   A growing number of Soviet Jews, including the best-known
refuseniks, have been allowed to emigrate under more liberal
policies implemented by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But many others, like
Tufeld, remain in the web of bureaucracy and indifference that has
held them for years.
   ``We have been married for 35 years, and we've never been
separated from the moment of our wedding,'' Tufeld said in a recent
interview.
   Even under more liberal travel and emigration policies, Soviets
are not often allowed to travel abroad as entire families. Tufeld
said he feels like a hostage.
   On Wednesday, Tufeld received yet another rejection of his
appeal to leave the Soviet Union and eventually settle in Israel.
That makes more than 20 of them since the couple first applied to
emigrate on July 4, 1977 _ ``the day of independence in the United
States,'' Tufeld noted.
   Mrs. Tufeld, 57, underwent surgery for a brain tumor for the
first time in 1981, in the Soviet Union. But Soviet doctors did not
remove all of the tumor and it grew back even larger.
   Doctors at Johns Hopkins removed the new tumor im mid-January,
and have conducted several operations since then. Tufeld said
doctors believe the operation went well, but Izolda remains
hospitalized and on a respirator. Tufeld hasn't talked to her since
before the first American operation.
   He gets weekly reports from his son Igor, who was allowed to
emigrate to Israel in 1977 and saw his mother for the first time
since then when he traveled to the United States to be with her.
   The KGB secret police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the
Moscow visa office have no objection to Tufeld leaving the Soviet
Union, Tufeld said. The hang-up is the Ministry of General
Machine-Building.
   A ministry official, Nikolai Gavrilenko, told him the objection
is in force until 1992, Tufeld said. ``That doesn't mean you can
leave in 1992,'' Tufeld quoted Gavrilenko as telling him. ``It
means we'll review your case in 1992 and decide how much longer you
have to wait.''
   Refuseniks have long said that rejection because of alleged
access to state secrets is widely abused by officials.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union increased in early 1988,
but the annual figures for recent years are far below the peak of
more than 51,000 in 1979.
   ``There is a certain amount of progress, but already the West
has changed its opinion to think that there is no longer a
problem,'' Tufeld said.
   But Tufeld continues to struggle, both with his own infirmities
and the Soviet bureaucracy.
   Tufeld and his wife, a former teacher, both were declared by the
Soviet government to be invalids in need of constant care. He has
not worked for 10 years and receives a $190 pension because of a
back problem that an American doctor has diagnosed as either a
herniated disc or a tumor.
   Tufeld said Soviet doctors cannot do the tests necessary to
decide which it is. Tufeld also suffers from severe gallstones.
   He gets around slowly with the help of a cane between the
telephone, a wall plastered with pictures of foreign notables and a
windowsill piled high with letters of support and futile
communications with Soviet officials. The window looks down on an
ancient church surrounded by drab east Mosocw apartments and
factories.
   Tufeld charges that officials who refuse to let him leave are
undermining the authority of Gorbachev, who has told the West that
everyone refused permission to emigrate because of access to state
secrets is given a definite date when he will be allowed to leave.
   ``I think there's a game going on,'' Tufeld said. ``They reject
you and wait for the reaction from the West. If it's quiet there
then _ `Let him die.'''

   Abu Jihad, the nom de guerre of the
assassinated Palestine Liberation Organization chief, was spray
painted in 2-foot-high letters on the wall of a synagogue here,
police said Sunday.
   The temple also received an obscene, threatening telephone call
shortly after the graffiti was discovered Sunday morning, said
B'nai Torah temple President Lawrence Schechterman.
   PLO military chief Khalil al-Wazir was assassinated Saturday in
Tunisia, and PLO leaders have blamed Israel for the attack.
   ``If they scrawled the name of somebody assassinated yesterday,
I'd say it's a reaction to the assassination,'' said Louise Shure,
regional director of the Anti-Dafamation League of B'nai B'rith in
Palm Beach County. ``Are we going to see more? I hope not.''
   Twenty-four incidents of vandalism have been reported at Florida
synagogues this year as Palestinian unrest has escalated in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<TEXT>
   A decade after agreeing to desegregate their
university systems, Georgia and five other Southern and border
states still fall short of the goals.
   The six states have been chastised by the U.S. Education
Department for lagging in improving largely black colleges and in
better integrating the races at all public colleges.
   The president of one mostly black school says money _ funds for
capital improvements _ is the key. Billy Black, president of Albany
State College, noted that the Georgia Legislature usually approves
only half the budget requested by the University System of Georgia.
   ``There's no question but that these schools up until recently
were neglected,'' Black said in an interview at the campus here in
southwestern Georgia's pecan-growing country.
   ``If you have a couple-of-hundred-year history of being
underfunded ... you'll probably need some catch-up money to be
competitive,'' he said.
   But fatter budgets are not the only route to racial balance.
Georgia is also exploring another avenue: outright merger of such
``black'' colleges as Albany State with nearby white institutions.
   H. Dean Propst, chancellor of the state University System, is
expected to make final recommendations on mergers in May.
   The Education Department report in February sharpened the focus
on progress and problems at traditionally black colleges, which
last year enrolled 217,367 students and which account for 40
percent of blacks earning degrees in the United States.
   The report cited Georgia, Missouri, Delaware, Florida, Oklahoma
and Virginia for such shortcomings as poor facilities on black
campuses and failure to meet goals for recruiting blacks for
white-dominated colleges, and whites for mostly black colleges.
   The goals were set in 1978 in agreements between the states and
the federal government, which had accused the states of violating
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   At the time, Washington officials said the states, though no
longer segregating colleges by law, had not eliminated vestiges of
segregation from their ``dual'' systems of higher education.
   In the February report, Education Secretary William Bennett
asked the six governors for formal assurances they will carry out
building, repair and other projects to fulfill the plans.
   Samuel Myers, head of a Washington-based group that lobbies on
behalf of 117 traditionally black colleges, says facilities are
being upgraded and more programs offered at black schools,
attracting more students of all races.
   But Myers, president of the National Association for Equal
Opportunity in Higher Education, says further improvements are
needed to ensure equal educational opportunities.
   ``The consensus is that none of these states has done all that
they should do or all that they said they would do,'' he said.
   In the case of Georgia, Bennett ordered officials to:
   _Complete a business administration building at largely black
Savannah State College.
   _Renovate a complex at Fort Valley State, another mostly black
institution.
   _Better promote transfers from predominantly white Darton
College, a two-year institution, to four-year Albany State.
   _Start an agricultural extension program administered jointly by
the University of Georgia and Fort Valley State.
   In an interview, Chancellor Propst said the building projects
are in the works and other deficiencies should be easy to correct.
   Kay Miller, the chancellor's spokeswoman, says the capital
improvements mean the state spends significantly more per student
at black colleges than at other schools _ an annual $11,315 at
Albany State, for example, compared with $5,449 at traditionally
white Valdosta State College.
   The Bennett report covered 10 states. Four _ West Virginia,
Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina _ were found in full
compliance with their desegregation plans.
   Three other Deep South states _ Louisiana, Mississippi and
Alabama _ never submitted desegregation plans. The Justice
Department eventually took them to court. The Mississippi case was
recently dismissed; the others remain in litigation.
   The Education Department said the 10 states covered in the
report have spent more than $240 million enhancing black colleges.
In addition, Congress appropriated $73.2 million for support this
year.
   But after Bennett made his formal assessment of progress,
critics of the Reagan administration contended he should have been
tougher on the states, concentrating more on integration of
students and less on physical improvements at black campuses.
   After years of desegregation efforts, Albany State remains
overwhelmingly black. Of 1,994 students enrolled for the winter
quarter, 366 were white, five were Hispanic, two were Asian and
three were American Indians.
   But the college, which 10 years ago had less than 4 percent
white enrollment, has met the plan's general goal of a
20-percent-white student body and is now focusing on new buildings
and expanded programs.
   It will soon have a new campus entrance, more paved parking
lots, a $6 million library, and a new nursing and allied health
center. In the longer term, a performing arts center, a new
administration building and a new physical education complex are
planned.
   ``We had unpaved streets, unpaved parking lots, and the lighting
was terrible,'' recalled Walter Burgess, the business school dean,
who joined the faculty 14 years ago. ``I've seen tremendous
changes.''
   Albany State has six ``2-plus-2'' academic programs aimed at
boosting white transfers from the two-year Darton College and
offers $200,000 in annual scholarships to encourage whites to
attend.
   One white student, physical education major Carlton Fletcher,
said he is impressed with the Albany State teachers. As for the
facilities, ``some of the buildings are really old, but the newer
buildings are as fine as I've seen.''
   Few expect a speedy integration of Georgia's state colleges.
   Ingrained attitudes from the days of official segregation
prevent it, said Albany State sophomore Roger Collier.
   ``A black person is not going to go to a white school because
they would feel uncomfortable,'' said Collier, a black marketing
major. ``I see whites walking around the campus and ... they don't
socialize. You pass them and they don't ever say hello.''
   The Rev. Clarence James, a black educator, sid historically
black colleges, if integrated, lose some benefits of environment
and development they can offer black students, and eventually lose
their black character as well.
   ``The racial reality is that there are no 50-50 institutions,''
said James, assistant admissions director at Morehouse College, a
private black institution in Atlanta. ``Once a school becomes 20 or
30 percent white, the shift is going to go on ... eventually to a
90-10 (white-black) split.''

   A college and five school systems
troubled by a growing shortage of minority teachers have teamed up
in an effort to lure more blacks into the classroom with offers of
scholarships and assurances of jobs back home.
   Until about 10 years ago teaching was an especially attractive
profession for college-educated blacks, offering opportunity and
job security that was sometimes hard to find in other fields.
   But by 1981, fewer than 10 percent of the nation's public school
teachers were black; that total is expected to drop to fewer than 5
percent by the early 1990s, according to Jack Miller, dean of
Georgia Southern College's School of Education.
   In Georgia, blacks account for 10 percent of public school
teachers, but their numbers will shrink to fewer than 6 percent in
just two years. At the same time, the black student population will
increase from 40 percent this year to 55 percent in 1990.
   ``There is a critical need for role models for black kids,''
said Johnny Tremble, a co-director of Georgia Southern's minority
teaching program. ``Boys and girls need to see themselves being
successful, contributing to society, and need to hear about values
from black people.''
   Black teachers also can help white students avoid racist
attitudes by showing it is better to ``judge a person on what he or
she has to offer,'' said Tremble.
   Tremble, principal of the collge's laboratory school where
future teachers get classroom experience, said he has received
numerous phone calls since the school announced its minority
teaching program in March.
   Three students already are in the program, and college officials
hope to sign up 25 to 30 more promising black students by
September, said Tremble.
   Five school systems _ from Bibb, Chatham, Emanuel and Barrow
counties in Georgia and Beaufort, S.C._ are participating.
   The school systems identify promising black students and provide
scholarships for those willing to major in education. The school
systems also guarantee the students a job after graduation. Teacher
salaries in Georgia range from $16,352 to $33,462, depending on
experience and level of training.
   Georgia Southern provides counseling and puts together a
financial package that could include additional scholarships,
grants, low-interest loans and loans that are considered repaid if
the student teaches for a specified period.
   ``There has been a great deal of national talk about the issue,
but this is the most complete plan to actually do something about
it,'' said Beaufort School Superintendent Terry Terril.
   Miller said the program is unique because the school systems
handle the recruitment.
   ``We're getting capable people because ... the school districts
decide who they want to come back and teach in their communities,''
said Miller, a co-director of the program. ``Thus far, I've been
impressed with the kind of kids we have been talking to.''
   All of the students taking part in the GSC program will have
above-average SAT scores, Miller said.
   Georgia Southern received a $50,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Education to help run the program for two years.
   Tremble believes fewer blacks are going into teaching these days
because they can choose from a wider range of careers.
   But the nationwide teacher decline is not a problem that is
confined just to minorities. Tremble noted that Georgia has a
shortage of 10,000 certified teachers. In recent years, an
increasing number of students of all races have shunned teaching to
pursue careers that appear to be more rewarding.
   Tremble said educators and guidance counselors have focused on
the negative aspects of teaching, without pointing out the rewards.
   ``We're not giving education a fair shake,'' he said. ``I don't
mind you talking about the bad, but talk about the good, too. And
if you're going to talk bad of education, talk about the bad of
other careers.''

   The ``Little America'' colony was shaken by
the bloody terrorist attack on the USO club here, but the U.S. Navy
says its 10,000-strong community in Naples won't be driven away.
   The car bombing that killed four Italians and one American
servicewoman was the first known terrorist act against the U.S.
Navy in this southern port city that serves as center for 6th Fleet
operations in the Mediterranean.
   The Thursday night blast also injured 17 people, including four
American sailors. Two Islamic groups claimed responsibility.
   Italian investigators say the attack was carried out by Junzo
Okudaira, a notorious terrorist of the Japanese Red Army, which is
tied to Arab terrorist groups in Lebanon. Police say he had at
least two accomplices, Fusako Shigenobu, the woman leader of the
Japanese gang, and a Middle Eastern or North African man.
   Chief investigator Romano Argenio on Sunday said he had no new
leads in the case.
   Security measures have been tightened at the extensive American
Navy facilities here, but officials and dependents say their lives
and activities haven't changed much.
   ``The first couple of days there is apprehension but it wears
off real fast,'' said Lt. David Morris, a Navy spokesman. ``You
have to get on with life.''
   ``We are all devastated, but you can't live in a shell of
fear,'' added his wife, Deirdre, mother of an 11-month-old child.
   The car bomb exploded as dozens of sailors from the visiting
frigates USS Paul and USS Capodanno were at a party inside the USO
club. The frigates have since left Naples, but five ships from the
6th Fleet's amphibious task force are due to arrive here Wednesday
on a routine port call.
   In addition to welcoming visiting servicemen from 6th fleet
ships, Naples is home to about 10,000 Navy personnel and dependents.
   Some are stationed at NATO's Southern Europe Command, but most
serve at the Naval Support Activity Base in the Naples' suburb of
Agnano. The 55-acre complex has been the administrative
headquarters for the 6th Fleet since 1963.
   The 6th Fleet flagship, the USS Belknap, is based in Gaeta, 60
miles to the north.
   The Agnano complex could pass for a small American town. It is
equipped with a supermarket, bar, restaurant, club, movie theater,
bank, hospital, church, post office, school and gymnasium. The base
also has a weekly newspaper, a local English-language radio station
and a TV station which receives American programs by satellite.
   But the Americans are not completely isolated. Since only a
limited number of enlisted personnel is provided housing, most
people rent apartments in the local community.
   Most live in the western part of the city in an area known as
Little America.
   The American presence has been an economic boom for Naples,
pouring some $250 million a year into the local economy.
   The newspaper La Repubblica summed up the feeling of Naples'
residents following the USO attack as: ``Italians, Americans what's
the difference? For us it is a tragedy in the family.''
   Still, many Neopolitans say they have little direct contact with
the resident Americans.
   The U.S. community ``is almost an invisible army, a community
that lives like a colony, closed in its own world,'' commented the
newspaper Il Messaggero. ``The women rarely venture out into the
city. They hate the traffic, they are not able to adjust, they are
afraid of muggers.''
   Morris said there are some Americans who can't adjust to
Neopolitan ways and rarely leave the Navy complex.
   ``But most people serve here for two years and that mentality
wears off after a while,'' he said. ``I don't think there is a
fortress attitude.''
   However, he said, Navy personnel are constantly aware of the
possiblity of terrorist attacks and take sufficient precautions.
   While Americans in Naples had never been terrorist targets
before, U.S. military figures have been attacked elsewhere in
Italy. Brig. Gen. James L. Dozier was kidnapped by the Red Brigade
in Verona in 1981 and rescued 42 days later. Leamon Hunt, the
Rome-based head of the U.N. observer force in the Sinai, was
assassinated in 1984. The Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist group,
claimed responsibility for his killing.
   ``We try not to draw a lot of attention to ourselves,'' said Lt.
Cmdr. John Marchi, another Navy spokesman. ``Naples is a very big
city and we kind of melt in.''

   The April 6 confrontation in the occupied West
Bank that led to the death of an Israeli and two Arabs heightened
tension between Palestinians and Jews, inflamed Jewish settlers and
embroiled the army in a controversy over who killed the Israeli
teen-ager. Here is a report:

   The conflict between Arabs
and Jews came into stark focus on a recent spring day when a group
of young Israelis hiked into an area where Arabs were tending
fields of wheat and barley in these contested hills.
   On that day, profound mistrust between reluctant neighbors
turned into terror and bloodshed. Yet it's likely neither group
wanted or expected trouble.
   Indeed, the whole affair may have resulted from a chain of
misunderstandings.
   Before the day ended, two Arab youths were killed, and
15-year-old Tirza Porat became the first Israeli civilian to die in
unrest that has swept the Israeli-occupied territories in the past
four months. Two other Arabs were wounded by gunfire in the April 6
confrontation, and 15 Israeli settlers were injured by stones.
   The Arabs said the Israeli settlers marched toward Beita and one
of their guards shot to death a Palestinian. They said they feared
an attack and rushed to defend their village with stones and axes.
   For the 16 teen-agers and two adult guards from the Jewish
settlement of Elon Moreh 35 miles north of Jerusalem, the day
became a nightmare. They said hundreds of Arabs encircled them,
shouting ``Slaughter the Jews!''
   Two very different accounts emerged inside Israel about how the
Israeli teen-ager died that day.
   After an initial report that she had been shot by Arabs, the
Israeli army said the girl had been stoned to death. But an
examination of the body showed she died of a bullet wound to the
head. The army finally said Romam Aldubi, a right-wing extremist
accompanying the teen-agers as a guard, accidentally shot her.
   However, the Israeli settlers insisted she was stoned to death
by the Palestinians.
   They accused the Israeli army, usually immune from political
attack, of backing the Arabs' version of the day's events. The
settlers, who number about 65,000 among 850,000 West Bank
Palestinians, turned the dark-haired Israeli teen-ager into a cause
celebre.
   Israeli hard-liners, who think Israel should foster settlements
on the land their army seized from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
War, rallied behind the settlers.
   The settlers lashed out in a personal attack on Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron, the Israeli army's chief of staff, for saying most
villagers tried to help the Israelis.
   ``Shomron is wrong. The Arabs were vultures. I didn't realize
how hostile and primitive the population was,'' Menachem Ilan, the
other adult on the hike, said.
   He said before the Israeli teen-ager was shot, some Arabs
shouted in Hebrew, ``You took two of ours, now give us two of
yours.''
   Shomron, for his part, grew angry when the teen-agers held a
news conference four days later to dispute the military's version
of events. He said the children and their parents were trying to
undermine Israel's army and even hinted about subjecting the
teen-age hikers to lie-detector tests.
   Left-wing Israelis, meanwhile, attacked the army from the rear.
They said the military wrongly punished the village.
   The army had placed Beita under curfew for five days, detained
hundreds of men and destroyed 14 homes.
   ``Why didn't the army wait until it knew the facts?'' said
Felicia Langer, an Israeli attorney who represents Palestinians.
   For the settlers, however, the army had not struck back hard
enough. The mourners at the teen-ager's funeral demanded revenge
and marched through an Arab village.
   Cabinet Minister Avraham Sharir called for razing Beita,
shocking Israeli moderates.
   ``Our problem at this stage isn't the Arabs, it's the Jews,''
Yaacov Hasdai, an Israeli educator, told the Jerusalem Post. ``If
we don't restore our basic values and send the extremists back to
their corners, we don't have much time left to us.''
   The final version of the army's report on that day has not yet
been released. However, it is likely to contain implicit criticism
of the settlers, who failed to follow military rules requiring
Israelis hiking through the West Bank to notify the army in advance.
   The report, according to published accounts, indicates Aldubi
himself may have caused the trouble by being too quick to fire his
M-16 rifle in the field near Beita, killing the first Palestinian.
   ``The farmers thought the settlers were coming to hurt us,''
villager Nitham Muthgar, 27, said afterward. ``One Palestinian
approached to ask what they were doing. A settler shot and wounded
him, and then all the villagers were afraid.''
   The subsequent chain of events is not completely clear. Arabs
apparently led the settlers into the village, where news of the
death had been broadcast over a mosque loudspeaker.
   ``More and more youths gathered on the hilltops,'' Rachel
Savitch, 16, said at the hiker's news conference. ``They got closer
and closer,'' she said. ``They descended and completely surrounded
us.''
   The settlers said they followed the Arabs into Beita because
they were afraid. A mob of Arabs, said Rami Hoffman, 17, were led
by ``women and girls with their faces painted, shouting, wailing,
whipping up the atmosphere to a fever pitch.''
   In Beita, the Israeli hiker and another Palestinian were shot to
death, and villagers attacked the settlers.
   Aldubi, who has not regained consciousness after being stoned by
Arabs, is believed to have killed the second Arab.
   Arab villagers wrested Aldubi's gun away from him but apparently
did not fire it, according to the army. Instead, the Palestinians
dismantled it and eventually returned it to the army with eight
bullets inside.
   The villagers say the only weapons they used were stones and
farm tools. Their version is supported by the army, which said no
firearms were found in house-to-house searches.
   But the settlers contend the hiker was shot by a Palestinian
with a Soviet-made Kalashnikov.
   Ariel Aviva, 17, said he saw an Arab firing the gun he believes
killed his fellow hiker.
   ``I looked up and saw an Arab man with a masked face shooting a
Kalashnikov rifle from a rooftop,'' he said. ``I was in front of
Tirza. When I looked down, she was lying there bleeding from the
head.''
   However, the army says an autopsy showed the bullet went through
her jaw and came out the top of her head, indicating that no one
firing from a rooftop could have killed her.
   But a police inquiry was expected to conclude it is impossible
to tell which version is correct, since no bullet was found.
   Some Israelis asked why, in a dangerous period of Arab-Israeli
tensions, the group was hiking in the Arab-populated hills.
   ``This was clearly a political act. The settlers viewed the hike
as patriotic, staking their claims to the land,'' Meron Benvenisti,
a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem who publishes annual reports on
the occupied territories, said.
   Ilan, 55, said denied that. But he added: ``This land is ours.
If an Arab has the right to walk around Tel Aviv, we certainly have
the right to hike around our homes.''

   Jesse Jackson on Sunday accused his Democratic
presidential opponents of inconsistent policies toward South Africa
as the New York primary contest moved into its final hours with a
flurry of ethnic campaigning.
   With new polls indicating the race for New York's 255 Democratic
convention delegates is tightening, Jackson, Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore Jr. aired differences over policy toward South Africa
and the Middle East, as well funding for combating drugs.
   The candidates also vowed to work for party unity, regardless of
which of them wins the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``It's Too Close To Call,'' proclaimed the New York Daily News
in a front-page headline Sunday as it released the findings of its
latest poll.
   The overall poll numbers, based on responses from Democrats
questioned Monday through Thursday, had Dukakis in front of
Jackson, 51 percent to 37 percent, with Gore trailing at 10 percent.
   However, the Daily News reported that in the final two days of
polling, Gore had begun to pick up support among likely Democratic
voters, at the expense of Dukakis.
   The survey questioned 502 likely Democratic voters and had a
margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.
   Meanwhile, polls by The Washington Post-ABC News and USA
Today-Cable News Network indicated the race was even tighter.
   The Washington Post-ABC poll, based on interviews Friday and
Saturday nights and pubished Monday, showed Dukakis with 46 percent
support, Jackson with 40 percent and Gore with 11 percent. It also
showed that Dukakis and Jackson each got about 40 percent support
in New York City.
   The survey, with a margin of error of 8 percentage points, was
based on telephone interviews with 183 registered Democrats who
said they planned to vote in the primary.
   The USA Today-CNN survey taken Friday, Saturday and Sunday found
Dukakis with 46 percent support, Jackson 34 percent and Gore still
far behind at 9 percent.
   The poll picked up some movement toward Jackson on Sunday,
handing him a slight lead over Dukakis in New York City, but
Dukakis had twice as much support as Jackson in the city's suburbs
and in upstate New York, according to poll results published in
Monday's edition of USA Today.
   The survey questioned 846 registered Democrats who said they
were certain to vote Tuesday and had a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points.
   Just how many voters go to the polls on Tuesday may be the
crucial factor, some observers said.
   ``The race is getting closer and turnout is the key,'' New York
pollster Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion, said Sunday.
   A low turnout will favor Jackson, said Miringoff, because of the
candidate's near unanimous and highly committed support among New
York's black voters who generally make up about 25 percent of the
vote in New York's Democratic primaries.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo said he thought there could be a low turnout for
the primary. He also said he ``wouldn't be surprised'' by a Jackson
victory.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis defeated Jackson by a 3-2 margin in Arizona's
Democratic presidential caucuses Saturday night.
   When vote totals were completed early Sunday, Dukakis had 54
percent to 38 percent for Jackson and 5 percent for Gore. That
meant Dukakis picked up 22 national delegates; Jackson received 14
delegates, and Gore got none.
   After their televised debate on WNBC, Dukakis and Gore marched
in a ``Salute to Israel'' parade on Fifth Avenue. Jackson passed up
the parade and met with community leaders, a session set up by one
of his most prominent Jewish supporters, R. Peter Straus, president
of the New York chapter of the American Jewish Committee.
   After the meeting, Jackson was asked why he had passed up the
parade. He said, ``We had to make a judgment about our time today
...my day is full and my outreach continues.''
   Jackson refused to comment on New York City Mayor Edward Koch
calling him a liar.
   Interviewed on the ABC television show, ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' the mayor said Jackson had lied when he said he was the
last person to speak with Martin Luther King Jr. before he died. He
also contended Jackson had initially denied he had ever called New
York ``Hymietown,'' a term widely viewed as anti-Semitic. Jackson
later apologized for the remark.
   ``I'm faulting him for lying ... do you want a president who
under stress, is not capable of telling the truth?'' said Koch.
   After marching in the parade, Gore was touring Hispanic, Italian
and Jewish neighborhoods, while Dukakis was attending a Gaelic
football game and then a reception with Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon
of Puerto Rico.
   Jackson's contribution to the ethnic mix was a fund-raising
event with Chinese-American businessmen.
   The discussion of South Africa began with the three candidates
agreeing that they would oppose severing relations with the
government of South Africa even if it does not move to end
apartheid.
   ``That's not the approach,'' said Jackson. ``I believe you have
to talk with the enemy.''
   The differences between the candidates emerged when Gore said he
opposed sending arms to countries bordering South Africa _ the
so-called frontline states of Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique.
   ``I think that would be inviting a lot more bloodshed,'' said
the Tennswee senator.
   Jackson said those countries ``ought to be able to defend
themselves from South Africa's bombarding of their infrastructure
and our investment.''
   Dukakis agreed with Gore, saying, ``I think the superpowers are
supplying arms to too many countries as it is.''
   Gore also quoted Dukakis as saying he thought current funding
was sufficient to deal with drugs.
   The Massachusetts governor replied that Congress _ ``you and
your colleagues'' _ had appropriated ``enough funds to get
started'' on educational programs to combat drugs, but said the
Reagan administration had not used it properly.
   ``But wait, but wait a minute,'' said Gore. ``This is a major
crisis. The drug crisis deserves more attention.''
   Jackson said that if he arrived at the Democratic convention
with the second-largest bloc of delegates ``I certainly would have
earned serious consideration'' for a spot on the ticket. But he
refused later to say whether he would accept the vice presidential
nomination if it were offered.
   Asked if he would choose Jackson as his running mate, Dukakis
said, ``I would not rule anybody out or in at this point.''
   All the candidates called for party unity. Jackson said, ``We
should not have the notion, the attitude that if I don't win, I'm
going to take my marbles and go home.''

<TEXT>
   Israel turns 40 this week, beset by a rebellion
among Palestinians who have spent more than half that time under
occupation and a wrenching debate on the young nation's future.
   The Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has
drained much of the joy from a year-long birthday celebration that
climaxes April 21, which coincides on the Hebrew calendar this year
with May 14, 1948, the date Israel was founded.
   A poetry festival and a $10 million rock music extravaganza in
the Negev Desert are going ahead but plans to bring singer Barbra
Streisand, tennis star Chris Evert and the rock group Pink Floyd
collapsed.
   Officials had hoped to demonstrate Israel's achievements and
acceptance during the anniversary year. Instead, canceled plans and
the absence of foreign heads of state underline its vulnerability.
   Much of Israel's success has been in developing military power,
the result of five wars with neighboring Arab states. For example,
it ranks sixth in the world in arms exports, which bring in about
$1 billion a year.
   There also is a flourishing cultural life, especially in a range
of music from Hebrew punk-rock to that great national cultural
achievement, the Israeli Philharmonic.
   Since Dec. 8, when the violence began, Israel has been consumed
by the question of what to do with the territories captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. For the first time
the issue is likely to be the focus of elections, now scheduled for
November.
   Liberal politicians say 20 years of occupation has had a
corrosive effect on morality and does not square with being a
``light unto nations'' the goal declared by Israel's first prime
minister, the late David Ben-Gurion.
   Abba Eban, elder statesman of the Labor Party, said growth of
character has not matched the country's growth in material wealth
and military power.
   ``We anticipated that within a period of 40 years we would have
outlived the rhetoric of struggle and resistance and would be
moving into some kind of drama and romance in social creativity,''
the former foreign minister said.
   ``Modern Israel does not owe the same allegiance, debt or
devotion to its traditional Jewish character, and it very rarely
compares its actions to criteria that come from the Jewish ethical
tradition.''
   He said democracy was being undermined by the emergency measures
of occupation, and the cooperative spirit of pioneer days was being
supplanted by materialism.
   Such misgivings are not shared by the rising star of the
conservative Likud bloc, Benyamin Netanyahu, who recently resigned
as ambassador to the United Nations. He said Israel's success
``borders on the miraculous.''
   Half a century ago, Netanyahu said, the Jewish people had
crawled from the Holocaust and the possibility of building a
national life seemed hopelessly remote.
   ``Yet in a few years the Jews recovered their homeland, fought
off armies that assaulted them, liberated their ancient capital,
built a modern economy, theaters, universities and concert halls,
and revived an ancient tongue,'' he declared.
   Netanyahu, whose brother Yonathan was killed leading the daring
1976 rescue of hijacked airline hostages at Entebbe, Uganda, said
the Arab threat is undiminished.
   ``The grim truth remains that the majority of the Arab world
still refuses to accept Israel's right to exist, and still seeks to
wage war against it, war by different means, including the present
means of mass violence and media stampede,'' Netanyahu said.
   In the former ambassador's view, withdrawal from the occupied
lands would shrink Israel's waist to a 10-mile-wide strip against
the sea, with thousands of young Palestinians holding rockets
instead of stones.
   The left believes Israel is strong and secure enough to risk
trading land for peace and that greater danger lies in keeping the
occupied territories and trying to rule the hostile and rapidly
growing popuatlion of 1.5 million Arabs.
   Palestinian intellectuals attribute the sudden explosion of
anger and violence Dec. 8 to three factors:
   _The Palestinian question was ignored by the U.S.-Soviet summit
last December and given secondary priority to the Iran-Iraq war at
the Arab summit in November
   _Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed satisfaction with the
status quo and a desire to make the occupied land a permanent part
of ``Greater Israel.''
   _Daily frustrations about army rule radicalized younger Arabs.
   A generation of Palestinians has been born and grown to
adulthood since 1967, resentful of occupation and less intimidated
by the might of the Israeli military. Many also have been attracted
to the Moslem fundamentalism spreading through the Arab world
   One result of these forces has been a young, underground
leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization that has taken
charge of the rebellion and is directing it.
   Saeb Erakat, a political science professor at An Najah
University in the West Bank, said: ``The uprising is a message to
the Israelis, the Americans and the Arabs: We don't want to become
Israeli. We are not a minority, but a people, and therefore we
demand our right to self-determination,''
   Many Israelis say the Arabs fail to comprehend or accept the
historical connection Jews feel to the land.
   Yehuda Avni immigrated from Chicago in 1949 and built the Vered
Hagalil ranch near the Sea of Galilee with his wife Yona. Across
the road from his stable of pure-bred Arabian horses is the ruin of
the home of an Israelite who lived about 200 B.C.
   ``We both picked this site with its beautiful view for our
farms,'' said Avni, 60. ``I feel a kind of kinship with him. I feel
I am part of a chain. The sense of continuity is something vivid,
and it gives depth to my life.''
   In Efrat, a Jewish settlement eight miles south of Jerusalem,
Rabbi Shlomo Riskin showed a reporter the rocky hills on which he
has founded a community of 300, mostly religious Jews.
   Seeking to dispel the image of settler as fanatic, Riskin
stresses his desire for coexistence with Arabs.
   The difficulty of achieving it is illustrated by his experience
with Majid, a Palestinian handyman who taught Riskin Arabic.
   ``I studied with him a few times a week,'' the rabbi said. ``He
had gefilte fish at my home on Friday evening a number of times. We
had what I thought were very good relations.''
   Then one day a bomb was planted just outside Efrat and one of
the prime suspects was Majid, who disappeared.
   ``I teach my children and myself to respect every human being as
innocent until proven guilty,'' Riskin said. ``At the same time, I
have to make sure that I protect myself.''
   The Arab-Israeli conflict touches almost every aspect of life,
even the 110-piece Israel Philharmonic.
   Ely Eban, 38, a clarinetist and son of Abba Eban, said the
unseen impact was brought home to him when he returned from
studying in the United States. In Israel, the tempo of life was
rapid.
   ``Whenever I would hear myself playing something here, it always
seemed a little fast, a little strident, a little more nervous,''
he said. ``When you live here, there is this rhythm that you take
on, and it does affect the music making.''

<HEAD>France Recalls Ambassador After 21 Anglers Arrested In Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France recalled its ambassador
to Canada on Sunday after 21 French nationals were arrested for
illegally fishing in Canadian waters.
   The French citizens, who had been protesting a fishing ban on
French trawlers when they were arrested on Thursday, were released
from jail on Sunday following a bail hearing.
   The French foreign ministry said the decision to recall
Ambassador Philippe Husson to Paris was taken because of a
``worsening of the French-Canadian dispute over fishing.''
   The trawler the fishermen were on was based in St.
Pierre-Miquelon, a group of small French-held islands south of
Newfoundland.
   The islanders have been banned from their traditional fishing
grounds in the Gulf of St. Lawrence because of a dispute between
Canada and France over the size of the fishing boundaries around
the islands. The men are scheduled to appear in St. John's for a
preliminary hearing on Oct. 3.
   ``Canada has a lot of progress to make as a civilized country,''
said Albert Pen, a senator from the islands and one of the 21
people who took part in the fishing protest.
   Also among the group was Gerard Grignon, a member of the French
chamber of deputies on the islands, and Victor Reux and Marc
Plantegenest, two members of the islands' territorial government.
   In Edmonton, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark defended the
arrests.
   ``This is a matter which is essentially a fishery dispute, a
very important one. It is capable of being resolved by
negotiation,'' said Clark. ``In the meantime, if Canadian law is
breached Canadian law will be enforced.''
   During the weekend, President Francois Mitterrand of France said
it was ``intolerable'' that the islanders were not able to fish
normally ``in waters they have for a long time been accustomed to
use for that work.''

   About 200 East St. Louis residents and seven
firefighters were treated for eye, throat and respiratory problems
after a chemical spill Sunday at a Monsanto Co. plant, authorities
said.
   A tank car being loaded with phosphorous trichloride overflowed,
spilling about 250 gallons of chemical, Monsanto officials said.
The phosphorous trichloride became a hydrochloric acid cloud when
it hit the air and drifted over the southern part of East St. Louis.
   Hundreds of families were evacuated for several hours from an
area of five square blocks, said Fire Chief Bruce Hill.
   All of the residents reporting problems were treated and
released at St. Mary's Hospital, hospital officials said.
   Seven firefighters were treated and released at the hospital,
Battalion Chief Raymond Mix said.
   Glynn Young, a Monsanto spokesman, said there were no injuries
at the plant.
   Phosphorous trichloride is a liquid used to produce agricultural
and water-treatment chemicals.

<HEAD>Law Schools Receiving Flood Of Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law schools are receiving a flood of
applications this year, and the reasons include Oliver North, Baby
M, Robert Bork, Black Monday and ``L.A. Law,'' admissions officers
say.
   However, for some would-be lawyers, it's none of the above.
   ``Law school has always been in the back of my mind,'' said
Harvard senior Janet Korins, who has been accepted by Harvard Law
School. ``I'm sorry to disappoint everyone, but I wanted to go
before I watched `L.A. Law.'''
   Ms. Korins is among this year's 66,790 or so law school
applicants that the Law School Admissions Council of Newtown, Pa.,
says represents a 16 percent increase over last year. The jump has
mystified admissions officers. At some schools, applications have
hit record numbers.
   The high number of applicants has made it even tougher to get
into law schools. The schools are seeing better qualified
candidates, including physicians, successful business people and
applicants with master's degrees.
   ``People who would've been accepted last year might not be
accepted this year,'' said Andrew Cornblatt, director of admissions
for Georgetown University's law school.
   Georgetown leads the nation with 8,500 applications, a 32
percent increase over last year and a school record. Cornblatt has
been left wondering why. Among his best guesses are:
   _The Iran-Contra hearing, the Robert Bork confirmation hearing,
and the highly publicized Baby M custody battle, all of which
showed the law in action;
   _The Oct. 19 stock market crash and the insider trading
scandals, which may have turned some people away from business
school;
   _And the hit NBC television series ``L.A. Law,'' which
glamorizes the legal profession.
   However, other admissions officers say these explanations are
speculation, and don't seem to prove true when tested against fact.
   For instance, most law school applicants signed up for the Law
School Aptitude Test, the standardized test used in admissions,
before the Iran-Contra and Bork hearings and the stock market crash
and while ``L.A. Law'' was in reruns.
   ``I have the same educated guesses as everybody else. But my
best guess is maybe it's just law's turn again,'' said Edward G.
Tom, director of admissions and financial aid at Berkeley's law
school, Boalt Hall.
   Boalt Hall this year saw the largest one-year jump in
applications since 1970. The number of applications rose about 30
percent, from 4,093 to 5,282, said Tom.
   The University of Michigan Law School stopped taking
applications at number 5,500, which is up from last year's total of
4,300. The school has 370 openings, said Allan Stillwagon,
admissions officer.
   ``About every forth or fifth application reports either an
interest in law or renewed interest that mysteriously arose after
watching the hours of Iran and Bork hearings,'' said Stillwagon.
   Seton Hall's law school here saw a 27 percent increase, from
1,500 to 1,832, said Dean of Admissions Edward Hendrickson, who
guessed that troubles on Wall Street might be a factor.
   ``The MBA might not be that attractive anymore,'' he said.
   Elizabeth Knier, a University of California, Los Angeles senior
accepted by Georgetown, said she has considered law for some time,
but made her mind up after testing the business job market.
   ``I was disappointed in the jobs that were offered and the jobs
that weren't offered,'' she said. ``However, it wasn't my prime
motivation. I've always thought about law school.''
   Courtney Koger, who was accepted by Harvard Law, said she
considered business school briefly, but stuck to her original plan
to study law.
   ``I'd like to go into family law,'' she said. ``But I really
knew that before the Baby M case even hit the newspapers. It didn't
affect my decision.'' Noreen Clohessy, a senior at Siena College in
Loudonville, N.Y., who applied to Seton Hall, said she had taken
prelaw classes as an undergraduate and always had the idea she
would pursue law school after graduation.
   ``It's not because of `L.A. Law,''' she said.

   More than 250 prisoners who rioted and
took two hostages at Ensisheim Prison surrendered and freed their
captives unharmed.
   The prisoners, who were protesting what they called inhumane
conditions at the prison, gave up Sunday afternoon and freed a nun
who worked as a volunteer at the prison, Sister Francoise, and a
guard who was not identified.
   Nearly all 260 inmates at the prison in eastern France were
involved in the riot that began Saturday. Ten of the prisoners were
injured.
   Five leaders of the riot talked for several hours Sunday morning
with negotiators. French authorities said they made no concessions,
but would take into consideration the convicts' complaints.
   The authorities did not say how the riot started, whether the
prisoners were armed or whether the prison was damaged.

   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
on Sunday the aircraft landed in Suki, 240 miles from the capital

   Relations have been strained between Ethiopia and Sudan over the

   When Alice Lisquez opened a letter
and found a $100 bill, the thought of keeping the money never
entered her mind.
   ``It never occurred to me to take it,'' Lisquez said.
   A Georgia woman, planning to use the cash on her vacation,
mistakenly sent 10 $100 bills along with an order for some plants.
   Lisquez, 47, usually spends her days opening about 1,000 orders
for Michigan Bulb Co. In one she opened about three weeks ago was a
$21.84 order from Mary Duval of Dahlonega, Ga., for creeping phlox
and peonies.
   The big bills also were there.
   Lisquez told her supervisor, Sue Barnstable, who tracked down
Duval. Barnstable sent Duval a $1,000 check to her to replace the
cash.
   On Thursday, Lisquez received a $100 bill and a silk scarf from
Duval as a reward.
   ``Lord, it's the least I could do,'' Duval said.
   The package also contained two letters from Duval, one to
Lisquez and one to Barnstable.
   ``Dear Alice,'' Duval wrote. ``I called your office to obtain
your name and to thank you. I, like you, am a working girl and I
had saved most of (the money) haphazardly and converted it to the
$100 bills, as a twenty gets easily spent.
   ``It was for a badly needed vacation, and thanks to you my plans
do not have to be changed.''
   The note to Barnstable praised Lisquez for her honesty.
   ``I still have difficulty accepting the fact that there is basic
honesty practiced,'' Duval wrote. ``I would never have known what
happened to the money.''
   Duval, 63, said the return of the money has saved a month-long
trip to England she has planned for later this year.
   ``I've never been there before,'' said the head nurse at the
infirmary at North Georgia College.
   Office Manager Lyle Hansen said he has seen a few mistaken
mailings during the company's 43-year history, but never more than
a phone bill or house payment that got switched around in the
shuffle, and never before in cash.

<HEAD>Dukakis Notches Arizona Victory Just Before New York Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis'
backers are hoping his victory over Jesse Jackson in Arizona's
Democratic presidential caucuses will give him a boost heading into
the crucial New York primary.
   Dukakis, who took 54 percent of the vote to 38 percent for
Jackson, picked up 22 delegates and six alternates in Saturday's
vote. Jackson got 14 delegates and four alternates.
   Gore, who got only 5 percent of the vote, was shut out because
he failed to reach the 15 percent minimum in any one of Arizona's
five voting regions.
   Arizona's other five delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta July 18-21 are top party and government
officials who thus far are uncommitted.
   Jose Villarreal, the Dukakis state campaign director, contended
that the Arizona win established Dukakis as the ``undisputed
front-runner'' going into New York.
   ``This sends two messages,'' Villarreal said. ``One to New York,
that Governor Dukakis has established a momentum throughout the
Western states that is going to carry him to victory in New York.''
   The other message, Villarreal said, is that ``Al Gore is no
more.'' Gore has been winless since Super Tuesday.
   Richard Ybarra, the Western states coordinator for Dukakis,
said, ``He's being called `El Nuevo Kennedy' in the barrios around
Phoenix.''
   Other supporters, however, said the Arizona victory was welcome,
but not overly significant.
   ``I think it's got zip effect in New York,'' said Dukakis
campaign coordinator Renz Jennings. ``New Yorkers are as
independent as you find.'' However, he said a loss to Jackson in
Arizona would have hurt the Massachusetts governor.
   ``We did just what we needed to do,'' he said. ``We picked up
delegates. We beat Gore to the point that he didn't even make the
threshold'' to win delegates.
   Jackson's campaign said the Arizona race had not been crucial.
   ``I don't think the Arizona primary is going to break someone
into front-runner status,'' Jackson's state director John Norris
said. ``Basically it's still a horse race going into New York.''
   He also said Jackson's showing was relatively good.
   ``It's pretty fair to say that we ran a strong second in
Arizona,'' Norris said. ``It definitely beat expectations based on
the polls'' which had given Dukakis a stronger lead.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has put his campaign on hold, got
1.2 percent of the Arizona vote while political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche had well under 1 percent and 1.7 percent expressed no
preference.
   Gore spokeswoman Sue Laybe acknowledged, ``We tried a grassroots
campaign; it didn't work very well. With all the money going to New
York there wasn't much we could do.''
   Dukakis ran well ahead in four of Arizona's voting regions,
while he and Jackson were tied at 47 percent in western Maricopa
County, which included south Phoenix and its high minority
population.
   Jackson also scored well in parts of Pima County, which includes
Tucson. He won the rural counties of Apache and Coconino, while
Dukakis took the other 11 rural counties.
   Party officials said 38,464 of Arizona's 680,000 Democrats
voted, for a slightly higher turnout than was predicted on a day
that saw stormy weather across much of the state.
   Dukakis received 20,814 votes to 14,538 for Jackson, 1,972 for
Gore, 465 for Simon, 35 for LaRouche and 639 expressing no
preference.
   Democrats on Saturday also began the process of choosing the
delegates who will actually go to the national convention.
Thirty-six are being allocated in proportion to the caucus vote,
while the other five top party and elected officials are
uncommitted.

<HEAD>Jackson Backers May Unite Against Koch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the black, Hispanic and liberal white
forces backing Jesse Jackson in New York's Democratic presidential
primary say they will turn their fire after Tuesday on Jackson's
most vocal local critic: Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   But while a strong enough voting bloc has emerged to give
Jackson a shot at carrying the city in the three-way primary, it is
uncertain whether his coalition can survive without him and settle
on a Koch challenger.
   ``It's not going to be the same campaign,'' said Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., a Jackson supporter who said he would consider a
mayoral race. ``But it is true that we are bringing people together
that we didn't have before.''
   Jackson voters ``would be a hell of a base for someone'' in the
mayoral race, said pollster Sergio Bendixen. ``You couldn't win the
leadership of New York with just those groups. But it would be a
hell of a base.''
   For minority activists, the problem in past elections has been
agreeing on a challenger to Koch, who has held office since 1978.
Blacks have favored a black candidate, Rangel noted, while
Hispanics sought one of their own.
   Still, Koch's critics said the mayor himself has aided their
cause by attacking Jackson and saying Jews would ``have to be
crazy'' to vote for him. Koch last week endorsed underdog Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., a Jackson critic.
   ``The one fellow who comes out the loser in this primary fight
is Ed Koch,'' said former U.S. Rep. Herman Badillo, an Hispanic
leader who also said he would consider running for mayor in 1989.
   ``Most everyone agrees that Koch's behavior has been especially
outrageous,'' Badillo said. ``He's gone beyond the bounds of
decency. ... It's really an anti-Jackson campaign of the most
vicious kind.''
   Badillo supports Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, pointing up
that not all blacks and Hispanics are in accord on Jackson. In any
case, Badillo said Friday, an anti-Koch coalition is not limited to
Jackson's camp.
   ``The fact that some of us are supporting Dukakis and some are
supporting Jackson has nothing to do with Koch,'' he said.
``There's a total basis here for us being able to work together
after next Tuesday.''
   Thus far, though, Hispanics remain supportive of Koch. In a
survey of Hispanic Democrats by Bendixen last week, 55 percent gave
Koch a favorable rating, to 19 percent unfavorable.
   ``His numbers are not weak enough that you could see that the
Hispanic community as base against him,'' Bendixen said.
   But Jackson should do well enough with New York Hispanics to
bring a sizable number to the Democratic National Convention with
him. As they work with Jackson's other delegates, ``They'll have
some interesting experiences. And that usually breeds cooperation
and long-term type coalitions,'' Bendixen said.
   Koch opponents had hopes for such a coalitin surviving from the
Jackson campaign in 1984. It did not, but Rangel _ a Walter Mondale
backer then _ noted that minority voters are far more strongly for
Jackson now.
   ``In the city of New York he has brought together a lot of
people, some of whom have problems with the existing leadership in
the city, who have never worked together before,'' said Rangel, who
is black.
   As for himself, ``I would consider running for mayor if I had a
group of people that really convinced me that I could do better
serving the city of New York than I could do in the U.S.
Congress,'' said Rangel.
   Badillo noted that he was ready to run in 1985 when black
leaders opted instead for Herman Farrell, the black Democratic
leader of Manhattan, who did poorly. Asked if he would run in 1989,
Badillo said: ``I can't tell what the black leaders are going to
do. If we can form a coalition, I sure would.''

   The man who leads 100,000 of the nation's
hog farmers says his doctorate degree and university teaching
experience are valuable _ on the farm and on the road promoting
pork.
   ``Those skills, coupled with a lot of practice, have been very
useful,'' said pig farmer Ray Hankes. ``I haven't regretted the
direction my career has taken _ not one little bit.''
   Hankes, 41, recently was elected president of the National Pork
Producers Council. The 25-year-old group says it has helped change
consumers' attitudes about pork and the way hogs are raised,
leading to the production of a more popular and leaner meat.
   ``I guess our programs are working,'' said Hankes, who earned
his doctorate at the University of Illinois in meat science and
ruminant nutrition.
   His main goal as president is to win nationwide approval for a
mandatory levy on pork producers. Farmers will vote in September on
the plan, which would collect 25 cents for every $100 in hog sales
to pay for market development and research.
   Hankes' second goal is make pork even leaner, perhaps by
offering a cash bonus for hogs with less fat or by paying less
money for those that are not as lean.
   ``We've taken a lot of the fat off, but there's still a lot of
work to be done in this area,'' said Hankes.

   Pop star Michael Jackson's first book,
``Moonwalk,'' goes on sale around the country this week, four years
after it was acquired and published in secrecy.
   In the book, the 29-year-old Jackson writes about his show
business friends, his girlfriends, his plastic surgery and his fame.
   Jacqueline Onassis, a Doubleday editor, helped acquire the
rights to the book and has written a three-paragraph introduction
to it.
   Doubleday was so determined to keep the book's contents under
wraps that it hired employees' family members to deliver portions
of the manuscript to the printing plant, The New York Times
reported today.
   ``Moonwalk,'' named for Jackson's trademark dance step, will be
accompanied by a barrage of publicity, including trivia or song
contests on more than 70 radio stations in 27 cities.

   Actress Gail Strickland says shock value wasn't
what motivated her to seek the role of the first regular lesbian
character on a prime-time television show.
   ``It's not often actors get to play parts that might make a
difference,'' said Strickland, whose nurse practitioner character,
Marilyn McGrath, on ABC-TV's medical drama ``Heartbeat'' will
reveal Wednesday that she is in love with another woman.
   ``The fact that somewhere, somehow, someone's perspective might
be softened is important to me.''
   Strickland, 41, says she's surprised that TV didn't break the
taboo long ago.
   ``God knows, they've tried to sensationalize everything else,''
she said in an interview in this week's People magazine.
   Strickland, whose credits include ``Cagney & Lacey'' and ``Hill
Street Blues,'' says she expects some negative viewer reaction.
   ``I'm sure they'll get mail, and I'm afraid they'll pull back
when they get negative responses,'' said Strickland, who is engaged
to a Boston businessman.

   Wolfgang Puck's trendy Sunset

stargazers, but residents complain the eatery's traffic gives them
heartburn.
   Community activist Sibyl Zaden and others say Spago's success as
a watering hole for the rich and famous has been at their expense,
with nightly traffic snarls that have disrupted their quiet
community overlooking Sunset Strip.
   ``We don't begrudge Spago its success, we just don't believe we

   Puck says the restaurant is doing all it can. ``No matter what

   Malcolm Bricklin, who began importing cars after
his gull-winged sports-car venture died, is being bought out of his
latest business _ selling inexpensive Yugoslavian and Asian cars,
the president of Bricklin's Global Motors Inc. said.
   Global Motors is the parent of Yugo America Inc., which
introduced the Yugo to the United States in August 1985 with a
minuscule $3,990 base price, and Proton America Inc., which plans
to import a Malaysian-built car by year's end.
   An investor-management group headed by Mabon Nugent and Co., a
New York investment-banking firm, agreed three weeks ago to give
Global Motors a cash infusion in exchange for equity in the company
and debt, said William Prior, Global's president.
   Bricklin, through Prior, declined comment.
   Bricklin, who will continue to work with Global Motors as a paid
consultant, introduced his gull-winged,
acrylic-and-fiberglass-bodied sports car in 1974. But production
never neared his 12,000-a-year goal, and the company died in 1976.

   St. Louis Cardinals Manager Whitey Herzog says
he can't figure out why his players are afflicted with a rash of
side pulls. But maybe it's got something to do with their healthful
diets, he mused.
   ``They're all vegetarians. They're all on salt-free diets.
They're all so finely tuned. They snap too frequently. There's got
to be a reason for it,'' Herzog said Sunday of his defending
National League championship baseball team.
   ``I think they ought to go out and eat a steak with some fat.
Get some juice on that muscle.''
   Joe Magrane pulled a muscle in his right side Saturday, joining
fellow pitchers John Tudor and Ken Dayley with injuries.
   ``Paul Waner never had a pulled muscle. Babe Ruth never had a
pulled muscle. Their diets weren't too good. Babe lived on hot dogs
and beer. Once in a while, that might be good for you,'' Herzog
said.

   Jamie Hutton figured to be a

round of the Heritage Classic golf tournament. Thanks to Greg
Norman, the Wisconsin youngster instead was the first to shake
hands with the winner _ Greg Norman.
   The 17-year-old Hutton, a leukemia patient from Madison, Wis.,
had a wish fulfilled when he accompanied Norman during Saturday's
third round of the tournament. The boy and his mother were
scheduled to fly home Sunday, before the final round began.
   That's when Norman stepped in.
   ``We decided to charter a plane ... so they could see the final
round,'' Norman said. ``It couldn't work out any better.''
   Indeed, it couldn't. Hutton walked the entire 18 holes with the
Australian, who won the tournament by a stroke. It broke a two-year
American tour victory drought for Norman.
   ``I just wanted to fulfill a wish for Jamie that he requested. I
think we did more than fulfill it. Right, Jamie?'' Norman asked at
a news conference.
   The smiling youngster said that ``some people like movie stars.
I just like Mr. Norman. Greg's been the greatest through this all.''

   Diane Olrick and Tony Jestis had a nice
traditional church wedding, then celebrated by climbing into
separate airplanes and flying off into the wild blue yonder.
   At Saturday's ceremony at St. Peter's Cathedral in Belleville,
the couple exchanged medals of Our Lady of Loreto, the patron of
air travelers. Then, the newlywed pilots headed to St. Louis for an
airborne wedding procession.
   At St. Louis Downtown-Parks Airport, the bride flew off in a
restored 1940 Waco UPF-7 while the groom followed in a Cessna 152.
Pilot friends and several wedding guests completed the unusual
procession in seven other small planes.
   ``The idea for the flyby just sort of evolved,'' said Ms.
Olrick, 31, an air traffic controller and part-time flight
instructor.
   Jestis, 26, a senior at Parks Air College, proposed last year to
Ms. Olrick on the campus. She received her engagement ring after a
romantic 2 a.m. flight.
   If riverfront passers-by were startled by the flyby, the
couple's friends and relatives were unfazed.
   ``I wasn't one bit shocked,'' the groom's mother, Dottie Jestis

   The debate over whether William
Shakespeare actually wrote the great literature and plays
attributed to him may make for good drama itself.
   The Bard will go back to court Sunday for a tongue-in-cheek
trial in which a prosecutor will argue that the William Shakespeare
who wrote plays, poems and sonnets wasn't the man who lived and
worked in Stratford-Upon-Avon under various spellings of
``Shakspere.''
   The prosecutor is Mark McPherson, director of the Daedalus
Agency, a Michigan-based investigative agency that has looked into
such matters as the Loch Ness monster, whether King Arthur really
existed and who put the bop in the bop she bop she bop?
   ``The Case Against Will Shakspere'' will be heard at Oakland
Community College's Royal Oak campus, where a collection of legal
and literary experts will argue the merits of the case.
   ``A lot of people think I'm doing this for the sheer pleasure of
being an iconoclast,'' McPherson said. ``This is not true. I've had
moments when I wished I was presenting the defense. It would be so
much easier.''
   Of the 36 plays, two long narrative poems and 154 sonnets
written between 1593 and 1623 and attributed to Shakespeare, many
were published anonymously, while others were published by an
author named William Shakespeare, McPherson said.
   In 1623, the works became identified with a man baptized April
26, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon as Gulielmus Shaksper or Shakspere.
   But, McPherson claims, Shakspere was busy suing debtors for
pennies, developing Stratford and getting married while some
struggling writer with a similar name penned the plays.
   ``I believe that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare,'' McPherson
said. ``I just don't know who `Shakespeare' was. The bridge from
Mr. Shakspere of Stratford to the Shakespeare of legend is shaky at
best.
   Michigan Court of Appeals Judge Myron Wahls will preside over
the mock trial. Leading the defense will be Detroit attorney and
former judge Peter B. Spivak. There will be a celebrity jury, plus
an audience who will vote on the case.

<HEAD>Continental Faces $1 Million in Fines, Plane-by-Plane Checks</HEAD>

   Continental Airlines faces possible fines of
nearly $1 million for various safety violations dating to late
1986, government officials say, prompting a plane-by-plane
inspection beginning today of the country's fourth largest air
carrier.
   Transportation Secretary James Burnley announced Sunday that the
Federal Aviation Administration would expand its special safety
probe of Eastern Airlines, announced last week, to Continental as
well because of the alleged violations already found.
   Both airlines are subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp., the nation's
largest airline holding company which itself is facing a review by
the Transportation Department to determine whether its management
and finances meet federal standards.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, said Continental would
cooperate with the investigation, as has Eastern, and that he
expects the findings will show the airlines are being operated
safely. He blamed the two airlines' problems on union leaders who
he said are ``trying to bring the company down'' by raising safety
concerns.
   Last week the FAA slapped Eastern, which is the sixth largest
airline, with a $823,000 civil penalty because of safety violations
found last year. The agency also began ramp inspections of Eastern
jets.
   Burnley said about 200 of Eastern's 267 aircraft have been
inspected and 19 were temporarily kept from flying until problems
were corrected.
   ``We're going to extend the ramp inspections, intensive
inspection, that we began on Eastern last Wednesday to Continental
as well, beginning tomorrow,'' Burnley said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' on Sunday.
   ``We'll have people who'll be walking around the planes and
through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks
in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily
identified is correct,'' he said.
   Burnley said the action was taken because a review of FAA files
showed that various FAA offices around the country have ``almost a
million dollars in proposed penalties against Continental'' that
are in various stages of enforcement action or under negotiations.
   Some of the violations, which cover a period of more than a
year, date back to November 1986 and include the period in early
1987 that Continental absorbed the operations of New York Air,
People Express and Frontier Airlines, according to FAA spokesman
Bob Buckhorn.
   Buckhorn said the violations, including some in ``noncritical
categories,'' included problems in operations, maintenance and
airport security. While some of the infractions were identified by
FAA inspectors, others were brought to the attention of the agency
by Continental, officials said.
   The airline has been notified of the penalties, according to
Burnley, and is considering whether to pay them voluntarily.
   Lorenzo defended the operations at both Eastern and Continental.
   ``There's nothing wrong with our operation. The only thing wrong
with our business is the fact that we're trying to adjust and have
to adjust'' costs at Eastern which has lost $900 million since the
deregulation in 1978, Lorenzo said on ``Meet the Press.''
   When asked about Eastern's various problems including those with
the FAA and its poor on-time record and high number of consumer
complaints, Lorenzo complained about ``trying to run an airline
when you have two fifth columns within _ one the pilots and one the
machinists union.''
   Lorenzo accused the unions at Eastern of being ``out just to
tear the airline down.'' The unions have accused Lorenzo of
siphoning off Eastern's most valuable assets to the detriment of
Eastern, an allegation Lorenzo denies.
   Lorenzo said despite Eastern's problems he has ``no plans or
intentions'' to sell Eastern, saying ``the door is closed'' on that
option.
   Texas Air Corp. had record losses of $466 million last year,
including $241 million at Eastern. Lorenzo has sought major
concessions from employees at Eastern to reduce costs, but the
unions have balked.
   In addition to Eastern and Continental, the Houston-based
airline company also owns Rocky Mountain Airways, Britt Airways,
Bar Harbor Airlines and Provincetown-Boston Airlines.

<TEXT>
   For two weeks this summer, the National Mall
will look like a slice of traditional New England life.
   A giant clambake will be surrounded by boat makers, cranberry
growers and stonewall builders as the Smithsonian Institution
spotlights Massachusetts at its annual American Folklife Festival.
   ``The festival is really kind of an innovative museum
exhibition,'' said festival director Diana Parker. ``An indoor
exhibition could show people folk pottery or folk instruments,
(but) to really get behind the genius of what those things are, you
have to see the thought process that creates it.''
   For the 22nd year, the Smithsonian will bring to Washington
people who have struggled to keep American folklife alive, a
program that Folklife Office Director Peter Seitel calls an extra
Smithsonian museum for two weeks of the year.
   Organizers once again expect about 1 million people to visit the
festival for 10 days ending Independence Day.
   Officials at the Smithsonian's Office of Folklife Programs
stress the interaction between the folk artists and the exhibit
goers.
   ``The people speak more eloquently for themselves than we could
speak for them, so we'd rather have them telling what the pot is
and why it's important and why it's made and how it's made than
having a museum label put on it that interprets through us why we
think it's important,'' Parker said.
   The theme this year will focus on how traditional Yankees such
as farmers, fishermen and craftsmen, along with urban ethnic
groups, have adapted to modern life while holding on to their
traditions.
   Exhibits will include an area featuring Massachusetts industry
from old-fashioned clock-making to computer assembly, plus displays
of urban gardens with Italians, Poles, blacks and Portuguese.
   ``That shows how people who were raised in the country ... moved
to the city and wanted to keep up that idea of a countryside
feeling, so they took a spare lot or their backyard and made it
into a hidden countryside,'' said Betty Belanus, curator of the
Massachusetts section of the program.
   The other end of the Mall will feature a clambake, ethnic crafts
including an Irish needleworker and Cambodian kite maker, an
agricultural fair with maple syrup, cranberries and tobacco, stone
wall builders, a maritime exhibit featuring boat builders and sail
makers, an oxen-pulling contest, ethnic and holiday cooking and a
half dozen bands.
   Smaller sections at this year's festival will feature how four
ethnic groups _ blacks, Chinese, Ethiopians and Salvadorans _
migrated to the Washington, D.C., area and how their cultures have
survived.
   Another section will feature Soviet musicians in the United
States as part of a cultural exchange.
   Parker remembered a recent festival that featured both Eskimo
culture and teen-age break-dancers from inner-city neighborhoods of
Philadelphia.
   ``Some of these people still write each other. Very close ties
are created. Walls are broken down,'' she said.
   The festival will run from June 23 to June 27 and June 30 to
July 4.

<HEAD>Report Says Northern States Face Long-Distance Rate Discrimination</HEAD>

   A policy aimed at equalizing interstate
long-distance telephone rates is not being phased out quickly
enough to end discrimination against northern industrial states, a
research organization says.
   The rate policy adopted after the breakup of American Telephone
& Telegraph Co. requires long-distance carriers to bear _ and share
_ some of the equipment and distribution costs of local telephone
companies.
   But the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research and lobbying
group serving 18 states, says pooling rates to spread out the
non-traffic costs favors the South and West at the expense of the
``Rust Belt.''
   ``The Federal Communications Commission requires the average
telephone subscriber in the Northeast-Midwest to pay more for
access than it actually costs to provide,'' it said in a recent
report on telecommunications policy.
   ``The additional payments are then used to subsidize
long-distance access for subscribers in states such as Florida,
California and Colorado.''
   Although the FCC has begun eliminating pooling gradually, the
institute said it should have followed the lead of Illinois and
started the phaseout years ago.
   Illinois has been shifting an increasing share of non-traffic
costs from long-distance carriers to local-calling companies since
1984, Madelon Kuchera of the Illinois Commerce Commission said
Friday.
   ``Every year that we transition more to the end-user, the
long-distance carriers are forced to pass those savings along in
lower rates,'' she said. ``So within Illinois, long-distance rates
have decreased almost 30 percent.''
   For example, C&P Telephone Co. in the nation's capital said it
costs 71 cents for a three-minute, direct-dial call from
Springfield to Belleville in Illinois during weekday business hours.
   In comparison, it said a similar call covering about the same
distance in Texas, from Austin to San Antonio, costs 99 cents _ 39
percent more than the Illinois call.
   Similar savings could be achieved on calls outside the state's
borders if the rate structure was not inflated to help other
regions, Ms. Kuchera said.
   ``We've always argued that we don't like subsidizing Florida and
California,'' she said. ``If we could have the rates reflect our
true costs, they would be much less.''

<TEXT>
   Goose Prairie has been described as
``a bit of heaven,'' but residents fear a plan to enlarge a nearby
reservoir may sink the outskirts of their pristine haven in a
watery grave.
   Life in the Cascade Mountain village would be altered forever if
the Bumping Lake reservoir is expanded to more than 13 times its
present capacity in an effort to help drought-stricken Northwest
farmers, residents say.
   But after three decades of debate, Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash.,
who represents Bumping Lake and Goose Prairie, says he will sponsor
a bill calling for the expansion. Other area congressmen have
pledged to support the legislation.
   ``It will commercialize the Goose Praire area,'' complained Chet
Clark, who lives in the remote mountain village during the summers.
``You'll have people, construction workers, staying there.
   ``It will have quite an impact on the hiking, the fishing and
the camping.''
   The village, with five permanent residences, 14 summer cabins
and a couple of businesses, is at the end of a narrow blacktop
road, near Mount Rainier National Park.
   Huge evergreens absorb noise and sunlight, giving the area a
cathedral-like stillness. The Bumping River, named by Indians
because of its rocks, races a few feet beyond the edge of the road.
The snow-covered Cascade Range looms overhead.
   ``Goose Praire is a bit of heaven in all seasons,'' Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas, a dogged environmentalist, wrote
in his 1974 autobiography, ``Go East, Young Man.''
   Douglas, who grew up in nearby Yakima, first came to Goose
Prairie as a boy and wrote of it in his memoirs after making a home
there away from Washington, D.C.
   ``Goose Prairie is now a part of a technological society which
may in time destroy it,'' wrote Douglas, who died in 1980. ``But
the values of the Prairie are so precious, so unique _ that all who
love the Goose Prairies of this continent will put up a valiant
fight to preserve them.''
   Those words proved prophetic, as environmental groups have lined
up against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation plans to expand the
reservoir.
   ``Douglas I'm sure would be turning over once again to see this
perennial project has arisen,'' said David Ortman, Northwest
representative for Friends of the Earth and a leading opponent of
the project.
   Ortman said greater water conservation efforts, not bigger
reservoirs, are needed. The dam would inundate 1,600 acres of
never-logged old growth forests, some hundreds of years old, which
provide habitat for creatures not found elsewhere, he said.
   In addition, there would not be enough water to fill the
reservoir for many years, leaving unsightly mud flats, he said.
   Bumping Lake is one of five reservoirs that provide irrigation
to the half-million-acre Yakima Project. Built in 1910, the 60-foot
dam backs up 33,700 acre feet of water that drains from the slopes
of the Cascades, providing water for the fertile but arid Yakima
Valley.
   The $150 million expansion project would include a 240-foot high
dam 4,000 feet downstream from the existing dam, 2 miles from Goose
Prairie. The new dam would create a 458,000 acre foot storage
reservoir.
   A total of 3,000 new acres would be inundated, including some
summer cabins and campgrounds at the lake. The village itself is
below the dam and would not be covered by water, but expansion
opponents fear their lifestyle would be disrupted and resources
like hiking trails would be destroyed.
   The dam is just outside the boundaries of the William O. Douglas
Wilderness area, where such developments would be prohibited.
Douglas opposed just about all development in the area.
   ``I was teaching at Yale when news came that a road would take
the place of the trail'' (to Goose Prairie), he wrote. ``I almost
wept at the thought of pot-bellied, cigar-smoking men roaming
through a sacrosanct valley and polluting it with the noise and
fumes of cars.
   ``I wrote, I protested, complained, but progress won out, as it
usually does.''

   Bermuda residents were the world's most
prosperous in 1986 with an average income of $20,420 a year, the
World Bank reports.
   The Swiss came next with an average of $17,840. Americans were
third with $17,500.
   The U.S. rank was due at least in part to the drop in the price
of the dollar, compared with the Swiss franc and other major
currencies, a descent that began in 1985.
   The rankings are contained in an updated atlas released in
conjunction with last week's semiannual meetings of the bank and
its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund.
   The average income figure for Japan was $12,850, for West
Germany $12,080, for France $10,740 and Britain $8,920. The incomes
do not necessarily represent living standards, since prices and
lifestyles differ so much from country to country.
   Citizens of Brunei, whose average income surpassed those of the
United States in 1985, were down to $15,400 because of the drop in
the price of oil. Brunei is a small country on the southeast Asian
island of Borneo, ruled by an independent sultan.
   At the low end of the scale the bank leaves out many countries
like war-torn Afghanistan and Angola where it does not try to
estimate incomes. The lowest figure _ $120 a year per citizen _
comes from Ethiopia, where two armed revolts have been going on for
many years.
   In Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta in southern Africa, the
average is $150. Burkina Faso has had several coups, but no
large-scale fighting.
   There is no estimate for the Soviet Union, which does not belong
to the bank. The average for 1,054,000,718 Chinese is put at $300,
down from $320 in 1985 despite official Chinese claims of rapidly
increasing prosperity.
   In many Third World countries, and not only those that depend on
oil production, average incomes have been going down instead of up.
Especially in Africa and Central America, some have seen a steady
drop since at least 1973. They include Bolivia, the Central African
Republic, Gabon, Guyana, Guinea-Bissau. Gambia, Guatemala,
Honduras, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania
and Zambia.
   The report provides some consolations for lower incomes. An
Australian baby born in 1985, for example, could expect to live for
78 years though his or her share of the national income was only
$12,370. The U.S. baby could count only 76 years though prospects
for income were better.
   French babies also had a 78-year life expectancy. Spanish,
Swiss, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish and Icelandic babies could all
expect 77 years.
   In the United States 99 percent of all children between the
standard ages of six and 17 were reported in school in 1984.
Because some prosperous countries start primary schooling at five,
the bank put their rates at 100 percent plus. They include Brunei,
Denmark, Iceland, and the French island of New Caledonia in the
south Pacific.
   Japan, despite its tradition of intensive education, rates 97
percent.
   But in Ethiopia and Chad, only one child in four gets to attend
school.

   A ``nuclear age'' curriculum aimed at
teaching students to peacefully resolve conflicts should be ready
for Oregon classrooms this fall despite concerns that it might
traumatize school children.
   The program was approved by the Legislature after backers said
students aren't being offered the information they need to cope
with a world bristling with the weapons of mass destruction.
   ``We can't let kids grow up with no knowledge and no ability to
handle what is probably the most important subject today, and that
is the threat of nuclear war,'' said Democratic state Rep. Wayne
Fawbush, chief sponsor of the curriculum legislation.
   Critics, however, said the curriculum will frighten and depress
children.
   ``To start pumping this type of stuff into them just seems to be
forcing them to deal with things they're not equipped to deal
with,'' said Lon Mabon, executive director of the conservative
Oregon Citizens Alliance.
   Mabon also said his group suspects the real objective of the
curriculum's backers is to promote nuclear disarmament. But
supporters say that's not true.
   Under the law passed last year, school districts will be
encouraged but not required to use the materials in their
classrooms.
   Chris Dudley, executive director of the Oregon School Boards
Association, said he can't predict how many districts will use the
curriculum once it's drawn up.
   ``It will vary around the state,'' Dudley said. ``I think the
Portland School District expressed interest in it. ... But I think
there will be other districts where the community won't want to
have that kind of curriculum.''
   The state Department of Education is creating the program, for
students in kindergarten through 12th grade. It should be available
to districts after Sept. 1.
   Among other things, the law calls for the curriculum to:
   _improve students' conflict resolution skills and encourage
creative problem solving;
   _provide students with an understanding of other cultures and of
the roots and nature of conflict between cultures;
   _present a discussion of the history of the arms race, the
potential effects and dangers of using modern weapons, and
strategies for preventing war in the nuclear age.
   Fawbush said he recognized the need for such a curriculum after
the 1983 broadcast of ``The Day After,'' the television drama
depicting a nuclear war.
   ``That prompted a lot of national debate,'' he said. ``Some
schools handled it well. But in other districts, including Hood
River, teachers were told not to talk about the issue'' with
students.
   Don Skinner of Salem, a statewide coordinator for Oregon
PeaceWorks, a group that promotes peace issues, said students want
to become involved in the nuclear arms issue.
   ``It's very important for our kids to feel they have a role in
this, because it's their future,'' Skinner said.
   But state Rep. Walter Schroeder called the bill a ``scare
tactic'' that could make students believe that the only way to make
the world safe is to get rid of all nuclear weapons.
   ``I'm one of those who believes in peace through strength, not
peace though weakness,'' the Republican legislator said.
   Fawbush denies there's any intent to promote a particular point
of view.
   ``All we're seeking is a balanced approach to the subject,'' he
said. ``Some people will conclude that we must have clearly drawn
lines and the means to defend those lines. Others will conclude
that what we need to do is erase the lines if possible and reduce
the points of conflict.''
   The Citizens Defense Education Committee, a group that supports
a strong national defense, is monitoring the drafting of the
curriculum to make sure it presents a balanced view.
   Bill Moshofsky, an attorney who is working with the group, says
the organization hopes the curriculum will mention the fact that
nuclear arms so far have acted as a deterrent to another world war.
   ``Having a national defense capability is no different than a
community having a police force,'' said Moshofsky, a former state
Republican Party chairman. ``It recognizes that there are people
out there who are a threat to our security.''

<HEAD>Democrats On Trade Decision: No Going Back on Plant Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders appear determined to hand
President Reagan sweeping trade legislation on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis despite a chorus of administration veto
threats.
   ``The die is cast and we'll just have to see how the votes
fall,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said as Congress moved toward
a head-on collision with the Reagan administration on the trade
issue.
   The root of the conflict is a provision that would require
employers to provide advance notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs. Labor is pushing it while the administration
is siding with business groups and threatening a veto.
   Following a decision by the leaders Thursday night to retain the
provision, there were calls for reconsideration from lawmakers who
said it was guaranteed to sink the entire trade bill.
   But Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said
Friday morning it was too late to remove the provision. He also
said it would be ``very difficult'' to pass a watered down version
of the trade bill later in the year if Reagan vetoed this one.
   With the plant-closings provision in the bill, Reagan ``may well
veto it and of course that would make our job tougher,'' he said.
He acknowledged that trying to override such a veto could prove
futile.
   ``It'll be close,'' said Bentsen, who had pushed for a bill
likely to gain a presidential signature rather than a veto.
   That effort ended Thursday when House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
decided to support the plant-closings plan.
   Among top Democrats, only House Ways and Means Committee Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., was raising storm signals over that decision.
He said it could mean the nation will ``let trade policy drift for
another three years'' and added that would be ``a tragedy.''
   Republicans are proving less reluctant to forecast the result.
   ``It's time to write the obituary,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., one of the chief authors of the legislation, which has been
on the drawing board in Congress for three years.
   ``Now is no time to let the trade bill go down the tubes,''
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said.
   The plant-closings provision would require companies with at
least 100 employees to give a 60-day warning of impending factory
shutdowns or layoffs involving 150 workers or more if that
represented one-third of the work force.
   Layoffs of 500 or more would have to be accompanied by notice
regardless of whether they involved one-third of the work force.
   Critics say the measure would prove too burdensome for business
and could be the forerunner of more far-reaching moves to strip
corporate management of its powers. Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin
warns against ``the obvious legal battles, confusion and
confrontation between management and labor that will ensue'' if the
provision becomes law.
   Supporters say too many breadwinners arrive for work only to
find the plant gate locked and their jobs gone without warning.
   ``Vetoing the trade bill because of the plant-closing provision
would be a triumph of right-wing ideology over fairness and common
sense,'' says Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``If business really
wants a world-class work force to meet foreign competition, then
workers deserve help in adjusting to sudden business decisions that
can devastate families and whole communities.''

<TEXT>
   With secular anti-apartheid
groups effectively silenced, clergymen have sharpened their attacks
on the white-led government and rekindled a longstanding
church-state conflict.
   Spared in recent government crackdowns, activist church leaders
represent one of the few prominent opposition forces operating
without restrictions.
   In recent weeks, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other
clergymen have organized and led demonstrations, issued harsh
anti-government statements, focused sermons on political themes and
dared authorities to act against them.
   ``The churches have been pushed to the front line of the
struggle,'' said the Rev. Alan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches. ``We have always protested against
apartheid. We must now go over to participate in the resistance
against apartheid.''
   Although President P.W. Botha's National Party government has
refrained from clamping down on the clergymen, it has attempted to
undercut the credibility of Tutu, Boesak and other prominent
ministers.
   Botha regularly refers to South Africa as a country guided by
Christian principles, yet pointedly tells anti-apartheid clergymen
they have no business in politics.
   In recent letters to activist church leaders, Botha said the
clergymen ``love and praise'' the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement, ``with its Marxist and atheistic
ideology.''
   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,
hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' Botha said. ``The
question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of the
kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the ANC.''
   ``I work for God's kingdom,'' replied Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize. ``For whose kingdom, with your apartheid policy,
do you work for?''
   At one point, the Anglican church threatened to sue Botha,
saying his statements were defamatory.
   ``I would like that,'' responded Botha. ``Then the government
will come forward with all the knowledge and facts it has at its
disposal.''
   Botha did not elaborate.
   The long-simmering, church-state feud began to boil over after
the government on Feb. 24 banned 18 leading anti-apartheid
organizations from participating in politics. Church leaders
marched on Parliament on Feb. 29 to protest the ban, and 25
clergymen, including Tutu, were briefly arrested.
   In early March, church leaders formed the Committee for the
Defense of Democracy in a bid to fill the void created by the
government crackdown. But within days, Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok barred the new organization from ``performing any
activities or acts whatsoever.''
   Boesak reported March 11 that his house had been stoned and that
he had received death threats. He said that if anything happened to
him ``suspicion should fall on the South African government and the
police.''
   Two weeks later, police searched the home of a Catholic bishop,
Edward Adams, and confiscated documents related to local
organizations in the southern Cape Province.
   ``The state is intent on an open confrontation with the
church,'' the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference said in
a statement condemning the search.
   Anglican bishops, backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie in Britain, declared the government had ``launched a
carefully planned attack'' on Tutu, Boesak and others, ``aimed at
portraying them as Marxists and isolating them from their churches
as a prelude to state action against them.''
   However, Botha's verbal attacks on activist clergy have won
support from sectors of the white community, including the Dutch
Reformed Church, the largest white denomination.
   In this deeply religious country, the Dutch Reformed Church has
long had close links to the government and maintained until 1986
that apartheid was justified in the Bible.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
25.6 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   Dutch Reformed leaders said recently that black clergy do not
represent the Christian church when they confront the state. The
leaders called on Tutu and Boesak to ``divorce themselves from this
impious road and to discuss their problems openly'' with Botha and
Vlok, ``who are both avowed Christians.''
   The anti-apartheid clergy are denounced frequently in letters to
the editor in the pro-government newspapers.
   ``These men are doing Satan's work,'' said one recent letter in
The Citizen, a Johannesburg daily. ``It is hoped that these
troublemakers are dealt with, and not to worry about the cloth they
wear.''
   But the criticism appears only to have strengthened the
ministers' resolve to confront the government.
   ``The government of South Africa has signed its own death
warrant,'' Boesak said in a recent sermon in Cape Town. ``No
government can challenge the living God and survive.''
   ``I am not going to allow this government to choose my friends
for me,'' Tutu said at the same service. ``If teaching the gospel
of Jesus Christ is going to lead me into trouble, tough luck.''

<HEAD>Gas Prices Triple for Farm Irrigators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tony Leddy, a southwest Kansas farmer,
received an unwelcome $75,000 surprise in his mail earlier this
year.
   A letter notified Leddy of a near tripling of the price of
natural gas used to power irrigation pumps supplying water for
2,900 acres of land that he and his father-in-law farm near the
community of Ulysses.
   The increase will raise his yearly bill from about $24,000 to
nearly $75,000, making irrigation fuel the single largest expense
for his farming operation.
   ``I know if the average consumer had a 300 percent jump in their
natural gas bill, Washington would sure hear about it,'' says
Leddy, 34, who has been farming for 14 years.
   ``If their gas bill would go from $45 to $150 a month ... then
something would be done. But we're a small isolated pocket of
individuals out here and don't have the masses to support that kind
of an effort.''
   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to roll back the
prices increases, and similar relief proposals have been offered in
state legislatures in Kansas and Oklahoma. But with a doubtful
outlook for legislation, farmers also are negotiating with gas
companies to try to obtain lower prices.
   Farmers say they could be forced to abandon irrigation in some
cases. And that prospect threatens not only the livelihoods of farm
families but the region's fragile agriculturally dependent economy.
   ``It's very obviously going to eliminate some people from the
business without a doubt,'' says Randal Loder, a Garden City, Kan.
farmer.
   The culprit, according to irrigators, is a 1986 order by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raising the maximum price that
can be charged for natural gas in production before 1978.
   In effect, the government freed gas producers to seek higher
prices from their pipeline purchasers. But that also translated
into bigger bills for irrigators who buy unprocessed gas straight
from the wellhead.
   ``Frankly we were not surprised there was an increase, but the
surprise was that it was so dramatic, so quick,'' says Larry
Kepley, a board member of the Southwest Kansas Irrigators
Association.
   ``The first any of the producers knew was here came a bill that
translated into three times as high as any they had been paying
before.''
   Farmers in southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma panhandle, a dry
region transformed into an agricultural oasis through irrigation,
sit atop the Hugoton gas field, one of the largest in the world.
   According to Kepley, there are about 11,500 gas-powered
irrigation wells in southwest Kansas and more than 3,000 in
Oklahoma.
   Because the Hugoton field has been in production for decades,
its gas has been some of the cheapest in the nation for pipelines
and their utility customers.
   The FERC order was designed to bring down high-priced gas at the
same time allowing cheaper regulated gas to rise to market levels.
   In Leddy's case, the cost jumped from 53 cents to $1.50 for a
thousand cubic feet, or mcf.
   Loder saw his gas costs go from 55 cents to $1.24, and $1.50 an
mcf for some of his 14 wells. Yet he continues to see no drop in
price for one well that costs $4.25 an mcf. ``I've been hit in the
pocketbook extensively,'' he complains.
   Gas producers defend the FERC order.
   ``It's worked pretty well,'' says Mike Waters, a spokesman for
the Natural Gas Supply Association, a producer group.
   John Stow, a spokesman in Washington for Amoco Production Co.,
one of the companies that operates in the Hugoton field, says
irrigators are not treated differently than the company's other gas
customers. He says the company also opposes any legislation to
control gas prices for irrigators.
   But irrigators contend they should be treated differently: most
of their gas purchases come during the spring and summer when
residential use is lowest and they usually buy raw, sometimes
low-quality gas.
   Few alternatives are available. Farmers in southwest Kansas say
diesel fuel and electricity are too expensive to replace natural
gas.
   Compounding the problem is the uncertainty of future prices. The
FERC order allows what, in effect, are floating prices. Some
irrigators were hit with a doubling or tripling of prices early
this year, but then saw them return months later to 50 cents to 60
cents.
   Irrigators say the changing prices make it nearly impossible to
accurately project their production expenses, can leave them short
of cash and ruin their cropping plans.
   ``It makes it real difficult to plan and your banker sure
doesn't understand it,'' says Kansas state Rep. Gene Shore, who has
sponsored legislation in the Legislature to help irrigators.
   Leddy, for example, prepared some irrigated acreage last fall
for growing corn. That was months before he received his January
price increase notice. He intends to stick with his irrigation
plans but ``we are monitoring all our expenses right down to the
penny.''
   ``We just feel like no major business can really truly absorb a
300 percent jump on something that is a major input like natural
gas is for us,'' says Leddy. ``They would try to do everything they
could to alleviate the problem.''

   Nine Virginia school teachers will become
Peace Corps Volunteers in Ghana for a year as part of an effort to
double the number of volunteers abroad, the Peace Corps announced
today.
   The new one-year program _ volunteers normally serve for two
years _ will help teachers in Ghana develop new courses, said Peace
Corps Director Loret Miller Ruppe.
   She said the Peace Corps, which hopes to increase its volunteers
from about 5,000 to 10,000 by 1992, has requests for more teachers
from many of the 60 countries where volunteers now serve. More U.S.
educators will be enlisted under the new Leadership for Peace
program, Ms. Ruppe said.
   The first assignments in the program resulted from a cooperative
effort involving the Peace Corps, the National Education
Association and the Commonwealth of Virginia. A Peace Corps news
release said Virginia has been taking steps to internationalize its
education, using former Peace Corps volunteers to help make
teachers and students more aware of other peoples and cultures.
   The teachers nominated for the program include elementary,
intermediate and high school teachers from eight different schools.

<HEAD>Serious Crime Reports Rise in 1987 for Third Straight Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious crime reports to police rose for a
third straight year in 1987 but the rate of increase was less than
half that of the previous two years, the FBI says.
   Reports of serious crime were up in all regions of the country
except the West, the bureau said in a report issued over the
weekend. Nationally, the 2 percent increase in 1987 followed rises
of 5 percent in 1985 and 6 percent in 1986.
   The amount of violent crime reported to police in 1987 edged
down 1 percent, the FBI said, but the level of property crime was
up 2 percent.
   The FBI's crime index level was up 1 percent in the Midwest, 3
percent in the Northeast and 4 percent in the South. The West
experienced the only decline, moving downward 1 percent.
   Across the country, the number of reported aggravated assaults
rose 2 percent from 1987, while larcenies rose 3 percent and motor
vehicle thefts rose 5 percent, according to the preliminary
figures. Those three categories of offenses traditionally account
for about 70 percent of the major crime reported to the FBI by
police departments around the country.
   The number of murders reported to police fell by 4 percent last
year; forcible rapes dropped by 1 percent; robberies, by 5 percent;
burglaries, by 1 percent; and arsons, by 5 percent.
   It is difficult to determine whether the FBI crime data gathered
from police departments signify an actual increase in crime levels
or if victims are simply coming forward more frequently to report
the offenses than they did in the past.
   A survey last month by the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics found that 37 percent of serious crimes were
reported to police agencies last year, compared with 32 percent
when the bureau's survey was first instituted in 1973.
   The bureau's survey of households, which measures crime that is
both reported and unreported to police, found that the amount of
crime in the United States last year remained stable.
   The FBI report and the bureau study both recorded declines in
crime levels during the first half of the decade. Many researchers
forecast an increase in crime in coming years as young people in
increasing numbers move into the most crime-prone age group of ages
15 to 24.

   About 50 masked anti-Israeli
demonstrators tried to disrupt a tree planting ceremony marking the
40th anniversary of the Jewish state's founding and this city's
role in the Zionist movement.
   The protesters on Sunday shouted pro-Palestinian slogans, set
off firecrackers and waved a Palestinian flag during a speech on a
city square by Israel's ambassador to Switzerland, Moshe Rivlin.
   Police dispersed the protesters after several minutes.
   The ceremony included the planting of 40 cedars donated by
Israel to the city of Basel, host of the first Zionist World
Congress in 1897.
   At a separate rally, local leftist politicians and activists
charged the city was endorsing Israel's Arab policies by accepting
the gift.
   At least 166 Palestinians have been killed in four months of
violent Arab protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

   The pilots of a small commuter plane that
burst into flames before crashing into a passenger ramp told
investigators late Sunday the fire erupted so quickly they had
little time to make an emergency landing.
   Carl Carlson, the pilot of Horizon Air Flight 2658 from Seattle
to Spokane, and Mark Hilstad, the co-pilot, made the comments to
National Transportation Safety Board investigators in a closed-door
meeting. The comments were overheard by reporters outside.
   NTSB officials and the pilots declined to comment to reporters
at the meeting a an airport hotel here.
   Carlson and Hilstad related the events aboard the de Havilland
Dash 8, which crashed Friday into a passenger concourse loading
ramp at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   All 40 people aboard the aircraft survived the crash, which
occurred after the engine caught fire following takeoff amid
overcast skies.
   Less than a minute after the fire report, the crew reported
control problems and attempted an emergency landing. Forty seconds
later, the plane came to a stop next to the B Concourse after
clipping three passenger ramps. The burning plane was drenched in
firefighting foam and the blaze was quickly extinguished.
   Of the 19 aboard who were injured, three remained in hospitals
Sunday, hospital officials said. One was in serious condition.
   Carlson, of the Portland area, told officials he didn't know
there was a fire on the plane until it made a final turn for the
runway during its attempt to make an emergency landing. A 40
percent to 60 percent loss in torque in the right engine prompted
him to head back, according to the remarks overheard by reporters.
   After Hilstad told him the landing gear was down, as they made
their final approach, Carlson heard someone say over the tower
radio frequency that the plane was on fire.
   As they started the descent, Carlson and Hilstad said, they
realized they were going too fast and they appeared to be coming
down too high to adequately slow down. However, they said, they had
no choice but to land.
   Carlson said he thought he was still in a comfortable range to
maneuver the plane to a stop.
   Hilstad said he and Carlson applied full force to the brakes and
locked the emergency brake in an effort to stop, but could not
avoid hitting the ramp.
   NTSB investigators have said that an initial review of tapes of
tower communications with the plane indicated the first mention of
fire came from another aircraft that was not immediately identified.
   ``You've got a fire on that airplane, Horizon,'' the voice on
the tape said.
   Hilstad described the fire as a big reddish ball of flame
protruding forward from the wing, and said it appeared while the
plane was at about 2,000 feet, going 205 to 230 mph.
   At a news conference in Seattle late Sunday, NTSB member Joseph
T. Nall said fuel was spotted on the plane's wing by a passenger.
   When asked if the leaking fuel could have caused an explosion,
Nall said, ``That's speculation. We have no way of knowing that.
   Investigators have an unusual videotape of the plane's landing
from an airport camera. They also have found a panel that fell from
the plane's burning right engine while it was turning to return to
the airport.
   Carlson refused to discuss the crash Friday night when he was
released from a hospital after being treated for back pain. Horizon
officials said he had been told to make no public comment until
after interviews with investigators.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the wrecked plane may be
moved into a hangar Monday for closer scrutiny.
   ``Had it not been for the quick application of foam and their
(the fire crews') efforts, we could easily have lost 40 people,''
Rick Smith, chief of the Port of Seattle Fire Department, said
Sunday after watching the videotape of the crash-landing.
   The videotape was made from a camera mounted permanently atop
the control tower, one of several around the airport, said Charles
Blood, Sea-Tac operations manager.
   The jumpy black-and-white tape shows the burning craft initially
as two tiny specks of light leading a thin trail of black smoke.
The craft approached, descended irregularly and touched down
roughly.
   Then it careened past a couple of racing firetrucks and across a
grass median onto a taxiway that runs parallel to the concourse.
   The plane stopped short of a Boeing 747 parked in its path.
Blood did not know if anyone was aboard the jumbo jet.
   There was damage to three jetways, a baggage car, a truck and
the roof of the concourse where a piece of propeller landed, said
Margo Spellman of the airport staff. Three flight gates were closed
by damage.
   Found Saturday was a 2-by-3-foot metal door that gives mechanics
access to the right engine. Nall said it fell off the burning
engine pod and was found a mile and a half from the airport.
   The plane's turboprop engines were made by Pratt & Whitney
Canada.
   Horizon president John Kelly said it was the airline's third
incident in 19 months involving the engines on the Dash 8 model but
the first passenger injuries in the company's seven-year history.
   Last June, an engine fire in a Horizon Dash 8 was detected
shortly after takeoff from Sea-Tac and the plane landed safely at
nearby King County International Airport. In September 1986 another
plane returned to Sea-Tac when an engine malfunctioned and had to
be shut down shortly after takeoff.
   Officials at the de Havilland division of Boeing Canada and
Pratt & Whitney Canada said in telephone interviews they knew of no
recurrent problems.

<HEAD>US Officials Still Wary Of Soviet Line On Anthrax Epidemic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials remain skeptical of Soviet
explanations for a mysterious anthrax outbreak in 1979 despite a
recent public relations blitz by the Soviet government.
   The Carter administration demanded a full accounting from the
Soviets in 1980, saying it had ``disturbing indications'' that the
epidemic was caused by ``some sort of lethal biological agent.''
   But according to a lecture and slide show presented by Soviet
health officials over the last week in Washington, Baltimore and
Cambridge, Mass., the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminated
bone meal fed to livestock, whose meat, in turn, caused the deaths
of 66 people in Sverdlovsk, a city of 1.2 million in the Ural
Mountains.
   The long-awaited Soviet explanation ``leaves many questions
unanswered,'' said Gary B. Crocker, a State Department analyst
specializing in questions relating to Soviet military use of
biological and chemical weapons. ``It does not fit with the
evidence and facts we have collected on the issue,'' he said.
   In 1986, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency released a
report alleging that the anthrax came from the Microbiology and
Virology Institute, a top-secret military research facility in
Sverdlovsk.
   The Pentagon report said ``a pressurized system probably
exploded'' at the institute, spewing as much as 22 pounds of
anthrax spores into the air, and that ``hundreds'' of Soviet
citizens died.
   Anthrax, an infectious disease which occurs naturally, is
considered a deadly candidate for use in biological weapons. A 1975
treaty signed by both superpowers bars possession of biological
weapons and significant quantities of biological agents, but allows
research ostensibly aimed at biowarfare defenses.
   James Oberg, author of the recent book ``Uncovering Soviet
Disasters,'' said he believes the Soviet health officials ``are
telling the truth'' in blaming the outbreak on a batch of
contaminated meat rather than germ-warfare experiments.
   ``But they are not telling the whole truth,'' said Oberg.
   ``They should have said this eight or nine years ago,'' said
Oberg, who urged the Soviets to open the Sverdlovsk research
facility to Western observers. ``The damage has been done,'' he
said. ``It will take a lot more of this kind of disclosure to undo
the damage that Soviet paranoid secrecy has inflicted on
international relations.''
   The Soviets had long denied the U.S. allegations, but had
offered little evidence to refute them. The more detailed rebuttal
last week came from Dr. Pyotr N. Burgasov, former deputy Soviet
health minister, Dr. Vladimir N. Nikiforov, chief infectious
disease specialist at the Moscow Institute for the Advanced
Training of Physicians, and Dr. Vladimir P. Sergiyev, of the Soviet
health ministry.
   The heart of their argument, bolstered by gory autopsy slides,
was that the victims suffered severe damage to their intestines,
indicating they ate rather than inhaled the anthrax.
   The DIA report had said ``hundreds of Soviet citizens died from
inhalation of anthrax,'' and that others suffered after eating the
meat of animals who had inhaled the deadly spores.
   The Soviet officials declined to answer questions about the work
performed at the Sverdlovsk research lab. But, in circumstantial
refutation of the U.S. allegations, they said no one at the lab
became ill during the outbreak.

<HEAD>Audit to Show FSLIC Deficit Doubled in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal audit being prepared on the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will show that its deficit more
than doubled in 1987 to as much as $13 billion, according to a
report published today.
   The Washington Post said government estimates indicate that
FSLIC's deficit could reach $30 billion to $65 billion in the next
few years. It attributed its report to government sources.
   The deficit at the end of 1987 for FSLIC, which insures deposits
up to $100,000 and manages failed S&Ls, more than doubled the $6.3
billion deficit at the end of 1986, the newspaper said.
   The deterioration in FSLIC's financial condition last year
occurred despite government efforts to stabilize the S&L industry.
   Last August, President Reagan signed legislation recapitalizing
FSLIC, which was technically insolvent and unable to deal with
failed S&Ls. The legislation provides $10.8 billion over three
years from the sale of bonds, to be paid off by a special
assessment on profitable institutions.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
which regulates 3,126 savings institutions, said last month that
it's too soon to consider bailing out FSLIC. Wall said the fund had
about $20 billion to work with over the next three years.
   In 1987, S&Ls suffered net withdrawals in seven of the first
nine months, and one-third of the industry lost money, pushing
overall 1987 losses to a post-Depression record of $6.8 billion.
   But the bank board reported earlier this month that net deposits
at federally insured savings institutions had grown for the fifth
consecutive month in February, continuing a trend begun after the
October stock market crash.
   The board said net deposits increased by $5.2 billion in
February, compared with a $1.1 billion withdrawal in February 1987.
Since the stock market crash, $6.2 billion moved into S&L accounts
in October, $3.2 billion in November, $2.6 billion in December and
$5.4 billion increase in January.
   The increase came despite the deteriorating financial condition
of many thrift institutions, particularly in Texas which has been
hit hard by the depressed energy and real estate markets.
   The Post reported that congressional sources said the final
figures for the FSLIC audit still were being worked out between the
auditors and the bank board.

   Sen. Edward Kennedy is predicting that
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis will win the presidential
nomination at the Democratic Convention this summer.
   ``I have never felt it will be a brokered convention. I think
Gov. Dukakis will be a success, and he'll have the votes to win,''
Kennedy told about 1,300 guests on Sunday at the annual spring
dinner of the Westmoreland County Democratic Committee.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., said he believes Dukakis will ``be a success
in New York on Tuesday, the day of its primary.'' He added that
Dukakis does not take the April 26 Pennsylvania primary ``lightly.''
   Asked whether he will ever run for the presidency, Kennedy said,
``I've indicated my concern is not constantly pursuing the
presidency, but working with public policy.''

   Instead of talking about defense, the
presidential candidates should be focusing on the social problems
that confront Americans, Rep. Patricia Schroeder said.
   The presidential hopefuls focus on economic and international
issues, she told more than 260 people who attended the third annual
Women's Fair at Lakewood Hospital on Saturday.
   ``Obviously we want America to be strong, but what are we going
to do with the family?'' she asked. ``Families are the foundation
of this government. Based on that, our government is in trouble.''
   Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who considered entering the
presidential race last summer, said the primary concerns of
Americans are ``education, child care and how people will afford
the American dream.''
   Schroeder, a member of the House Armed Services committee and
16-year congresswoman, said women should not feel guilty about
asking for equal rights.
   ``As long as they are going to take taxes from us equally, they
might as well treat us equally,'' she said.

   Sculptor Louise Nevelson, a pioneer of
environmental art and one of the world's most famous women artists,
died Sunday. She was 88.
   Mrs. Nevelson, who had been in poor health for several months,
died at her home in Manhattan's Soho district.
   She remained active almost to the time of her death, having
recently finished a 35-foot black steel sculpture being installed
at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her
1950s work is scheduled for this summer at the Pompidou Center in
Paris.
   ``Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and one of the
most arresting women of her time,'' John Russell, art critic of The
New York Times, wrote in assessing her work.
   The artist was known for her use of darkness and deep shadows,
especially in wall sculptures.
   She was born in Kiev, in the Ukraine, in September 1899. The
exact date was not known, but she picked Sept. 23. Her father
emigrated to the United States in 1902 and set up a successful
timber company in Rockland, Maine.
   The family remained in Russia until the company was successful,
and Mrs. Nevelson stopped speaking for six months as a child to
protest the separation.
   She married Charles Nevelson in 1920.
   The couple lived in New York City, where Mrs. Nevelson studied
at the Art Students League. They were separated in 1931, and Mrs.
Nevelson went to study in Europe until the rise of Nazism in
Germany.
   She struggled for decades, gaining only widespread recognition _
as well as financial security _ when she was in her 60s.
   Survivors include a son and three granddaughters. Funeral
services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a
later date.

   Louise Nevelson, who turned scavenged balusters,
bedposts and odd bits of wood into masterpieces of modern
sculpture, has died. She was 88.
   Mrs. Nevelson, who had been in poor health for several months,
died Sunday at her home.
   Mrs. Nevelson was a serious artist for half a century, but her
work was largely ignored until the late 1950s.
   She remained active almost to the end, having recently finished
a 35-foot black steel sculpture being installed at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her 1950s work is
scheduled for this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.
   A regal woman who wore mainly black and preferred that color for
her creations as well, Mrs. Nevelson was generally regarded as one
of the nation's greatest and most prolific sculptors.
   Her confidence in her work never flagged despite the early lack
of recognition outside an intimate circle of artistic friends.
   When success did come, Mrs. Nevelson accepted it with aplomb and
without compromise.
   ``I have all the commissions I want. But on my own terms. Nobody
tells me what to do. They take what I give them,'' she said in a
1983 interview with The Associated Press.
   The artist was perhaps best known for black-on-black wood boxes
assembled from ``found'' objects put together in unusual ways. She
also worked in white and in gold, but invariably in monochromes. In
later years, Mrs. Nevelson used metal and plexiglass as well as
wood.
   Her work was big, dramatic, often dark and intense. Some critics
felt it was cold, airless and sterile. Others called it graceful,
warm, haunting and uplifting.
   Critic Hilton Kramer, in an introduction to ``Nevelson's World''
in 1983, praised her as having expanded the scale, drama and
psychological intensity of modern art, much as Martha Graham had
influenced dance.
   ``Once she emerged as a major figure in the late '50s, she could
never again be ignored,'' Kramer wrote. ``She turned out to be one
of those artists who changed the way we look at things.''
   Mrs. Nevelson lived in adjoining houses on Spring Street in
Manhattan's Little Italy section. Behind a wrought-iron door were
17 rooms and a garage studio where she did much of her wood work.
   It was not unusual to find odd assortments of wood in the studio
_ finials, newels, barrel tops, steering wheels and packing crate
pieces that Mrs. Nevelson or her long-time assistant, Diana
MacKown, culled from junk piles.
   Friends also contributed raw materials, such as sculpture bases,
organ pipes, boxes or bits of furniture that the artist would turn
into murals, constructed walls or standing sculptures.
   Mrs. Nevelson was born in Kiev, Russia, a few months before the
turn of the century, the date never precisely recorded. Her family,
the Berliawskys, came to the United States when she was 4 and
settled in Rockland, Maine.
   Louise Berliawsky decided on her career at an early age.
   ``I felt like an artist. You feel it _ just like you feel you're
a singer if you have a voice,'' she once said. ``I have that
blessing, and there was never a time that I questioned it or
doubted it.''
   In 1920, she married Charles Nevelson, a wealthy New York ship
owner, and moved to the city. They had a son, Myron, and separated
in 1931.
   Mrs. Nevelson traveled to Munich, where she studied with Hans
Hofmann. Upon the rise of the Nazis, she returned to her New York
studio to work with paint, plaster, terra-cotta, marble, aluminum,
bronze and odd bits of wood.
   ``I always wanted to show the world that art is everywhere,
except it has to pass through a creative mind,'' she said.
   But it was not until her 60th year in 1959 that Mrs. Nevelson
was recognized as a major artist with ``Dawn's Wedding Feast,'' her
first all-white ``environment.''
   It was a majestic series of standing and assembled columnar
bride, groom, wedding cake and chapel, constructed in Mrs.
Nevelson's favorite medium, pieces of wooden junk.
   In succeeding years, Mrs. Nevelson produced her notable
all-black sculpture house, ``Mrs. N's Palace'' and the white Chapel
of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church in New York.
   Her 1964 ``Homage to 6,000,000,'' an enormous painted wood
memorial of the Jews killed in the Holocaust, sold for $110,000 in
1980. Two Nevelson sculptures dedicated in 1983 were commissioned
by the American Medical Association in Washington at a cost of
$640,000.
   Age did not slow her. In her 84th year, Mrs. Nevelson embarked
on creating the sets and costumes for a production of the opera
``Orfeo and Euridice'' in St. Louis. In 1985, she was among the
first recipients of the National Medal of the Arts.
   Mrs. Nevelson studied religion, philosophy and literature and
spoke in metaphysical terms of the creative energy she seemed to
have in abundance. But she rejected those who saw her preoccupation
with black boxes and bits of wood as a search for truth or some
deeper meaning of life.
   ``I'm not looking for the truth. I'm looking to fulfull my life
to its fullest capacity,'' she said. ``Some say you did it for the
world. I said, `No, I did it for myself' ... What is the world?
It's a land we don't know too much about.''
   Survivors include her son and three granddaughters. Funeral
services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a
later date.

   John S. Chandley, managing editor of The
Kansas City Times for 14 years, has died at age 79.
   Chandley, who died Sunday at St. Joseph Medical Center, had
worked for the Times since 1929, rising from reporter to copy
editor to afternoon city editor and in 1960 to managing editor.
   He retired in 1974, saying, ``If I had to do it all over again,
I'd do it the same. It's been the shortest 45 years of my life and,
really, I've never regretted one day of it.''
   People who worked with Chandley remembered him as a gruff, but
warm-hearted man who loved to tell stories and believed the best
story ideas came from bars.
   ``He was an excellent editor,'' said Donald D. Jones, the
readers' representative for newspaper and a former city editor and
reporter under Chandley. ``He demanded near-perfection. You didn't
come back with half-reported stories.''
   Chandley, born the son of a railroad dispatcher in Ellis, Kan.,
once said he did not believe writing was his strength. ``But I
think I have a feel for stories,'' he said. ``It's an instinct.
That's the only way I can describe it.''
   Chandley had served as president of the Missouri Associated
Press Editors and as president of the Kansas City Press Club and
Kansas City Star Public Activities Association.
   He is survived by his wife, Carol, and a daughter, Barbara
Puckett of Terre Haute, Ind.
   Funeral arrangements were not complete.

   While workers put the finishing touches on this
city's new pastel-pink basketball arena, about 700 ragged, hungry
men a block away cling to the gate of a homeless shelter waiting
for the day's only meal.
   For five years, city planners have tried to move the shelter in
the Overtown section _ scene of the 1982 riots _ for fear families
venturing downtown to watch NBA stars like Larry Bird or Magic
Johnson will be hassled by vagrants, beggars and drug addicts.
   ``I'm sure the shelter is doing fine work, but some of the
clientele tend to congregate on the sidewalk all day,'' said
Matthew Schwartz, deputy director of Miami's Department of
Development. ``It's an environment that's simply not conducive to
the arena, the area development or any kind of business.''
   Most of the homeless who gather at the Camillus House shelter
for the 3 p.m. soup line know little about the $52.5 million Miami
Arena, the city's fledgling NBA franchise or the planned $150
million project to rejuvenate the blighted area. But they are
painfully aware they have never been a part of the big plans.
   ``It's another roundup,'' said C.C. Williams, a 28-year-old
ex-convict who spends the night in abandoned warehouses and
sometimes finds day-labor jobs. ``The police came and took us away
before the Orange Bowl and when the pope came through. This is the
same kind of thing.''
   ``People drive through here on their way back from work and they
stare at us like we're animals at the zoo,'' said Terence Radd, a
22-year-old Detroit native who says he has turned to petty crime
for survival. ``I know we're probably an embarrassment _ but we've
got a little pride, too.''
   Brother Paul Johnson, who operates Camillus House for the
Brothers of the Good Shepherd, says he is not opposed to progress,
but doesn't want to see the homeless get a raw deal.
   ``I love basketball just like everyone else, but since when do
the recreational needs of the wealthy become more important than
the basic needs of human beings?'' he asserted.
   The city has offered just over $1 million for the half-block
Camillus House property.
   ``We've been here 30 years, it wasn't our idea to move,''
Johnson said, adding that he thinks it's worth $2 million.
   But Schwartz said: ``That figure is out of line. ... The city
has limits as to what it can pay.''
   Under public acquisition laws, the city has the right to condemn
Camillus House and take the property. But Johnson said if that
happens he will sue for the true value of the land plus hefty
damages, a suit Schwartz acknowledges the city probably would lose.
   With the 16,500-seat arena set to open in July, Schwartz says
the arena's operators and owners of the Miami Heat basketball
franchise are putting subtle pressure on the city to move Camillus
House.
   The Heat, which tips off its National Basketball Association
schedule in the arena in November, has publicly steered clear of
the homeless controversy for fear it could hurt the team's image.
Team owners Lewis Schaffel and Zev Bufman refused comment.
   The arena is the centerpiece of a city plan to turn the Overtown
slum into a thriving middle-income community with four residential
complexes, hotels, shops and a cultural center. Nearby are the
year-old Bayside festival marketplace and newly opened Bayfront
Amphitheater.
   The Camillus House has plans of its own if it is bought out.
Johnson has already purchased a 1.8-acre lot on the other side of
downtown near the city police station to serve the homeless, who he
said number 8,700 in summer and 10,000 in winter in Dade County.
   ``The city just seems to think that if it ignores these people
long enough, they will go away,'' Johnson said.

   Here is a chronology of events in the hijacking of Kuwait
Airways Flight 422:
   
   April 5 _ The Boeing 747 with 112 people aboard, including three
members of the Kuwaiti royal family, is hijacked on a flight to
Kuwait from Bangkok and diverted to Mashhad in northeastern Iran.
The Arab hijackers demand freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists
jailed in Kuwait for their convictions in the bombings of the U.S.
and French embassies there in 1983. They threaten to blow up the
plane if the demand is not met. Kuwait refuses. One passenger with
heart condition is released. Kuwait asks Iran not to allow the
plane to take off.
   
   April 6 _ Kuwait sends a team to Iran to negotiate with the
hijackers but vows not to yield to their demands. The hijackers
release 24 women and call a doctor on board to treat passengers
they describe as ``unwell.''
   April 7 _ The hijackers release 32 more hostages. The plane is
refueled after hijackers shoot at airport security and threaten to
force the plane to take off with fuel tanks near empty.
   
   April 8 _ The plane leaves Mashhad but is refused permission to
land in Beirut and Damascus. After seven hours in the air, the
plane lands at Larnaca, Cyprus.
   
   April 9 _ The hijackers kill a Kuwaiti security guard on the
plane after their demands for fuel are not met. The pilot says
captives are being beaten. Another captive is freed after a PLO
official and two Cypriot officials go to the plane and talk with
the hijackers.
   April 10 _ Negotiations with PLO officials continue. The
hijackers threaten a ``slow and quiet massacre'' and say they will
force the pilot to take off and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace
if demands are not met. In Lebanon, the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad
terrorist group threatens to kill kidnapped foreign hostages if any
attempt is made to storm the plane.
   
   April 11 _ The hijackers kill a second captive, identified as a
Kuwaiti security officer. A passenger tells airport officials via
radio the hijackers have threatened to shoot all the passengers if
the plane is not refueled.
   April 12 _ Twelve more hostages are freed. The plane is refueled
and leaves Cyprus for Algeria.
   
   April 13 _ Algerian officials begin negotiations aboard the
plane at Algiers airport. Government delegation arrives from Kuwait.
   April 15 _ The hijackers release another ailing passenger, and
intensive negotiations continue.

   The dollar closed lower slightly against the
Japanese yen Monday in Tokyo, while stock prices declined
substantially in slow trading.
   The dollar closed at 123.78 yen, down from Friday's close of
124.13 yen. It opened at 123.83 yen and ranged between 123.68 yen
and 123.85 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, closed at 26,671.45 points Monday, down 222.12
points from Friday's close.
   Traders said fear of continued intervention by the Bank of Japan
following the dollar's sharply lower opening Friday discouraged
potential dollar sellers amid quiet trading.
   ``The dollar is only slightly lower'' said a dealer at a major
commercial bank, ``not enough to indicate a change in the
currency's fundamentals.''
   The plunge of the dollar and share prices followed news of the
$13.8 billion U.S. trade deficit for February.

   Marlin Fitzwater, President Reagan's chief spokesman, said,``The
government of Iran should understand that we will protect our ships

   Fitzwater said the attacks were on oil platforms at Sirri and
Sassan in the Southern Gulf.
   ``These platforms are used as command and control radar stations
for the Iranian military,'' he said.

   U.S. warships on Monday attacked two
offshore Iranian oil facilities in the southern gulf in retaliation
for a mine blast that ripped open the hull of an American frigate
last week.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the warships
first struck the Sassan platform at 9 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT).
Twenty-three minutes later they blasted the Nasr platform on the
nearby Sirri Island.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, noted that the ``aggressive U.S.
attack'' came after the United states had blamed Iran for sowing
mines in the waterway one of which blasted the hull of the USS
missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts.
   Gulf-based Western diplomats and shipping sources said the
Sassan platform was ablaze after the attack, but said they could
not immediately tell how many warships participated in the attack.
   In Washington, The White House confirmed at a news conference
early Tuesday that the U.S. warships had shelled the Iranian
offshore oil platforms in retaliation for sowing mines in the gulf.
   The shipping executives said a number of salvage tugboats were
en route to Sassan and Nasr platfores. These tugs were requesting
permission from the American warships to let them rescue survivors
and help extinguish fires.
   The Americans, the executives said, told the tugs they may
rescue survivors but they may not participate in any firefighting.
   The two targets were pounded shortly after a warning from the
U.S. warships to Iranian workers to evacuate the platform and the
island.
   Shipping executives said their monitors picked up a radio
message at 9:00 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT) from the U.S. warships to the
Sassan platform telling workers to evacuate the facility, saying it
``will be shelled in five minutes.''
   Sassan is sister platform to Rostam, which was wrecked by
American gunners in October 1987 when the Iranians fired a
Chinese-made Silkworm missile into the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil
tanker. Eighteen persons were injured in the tanker attack,
including the captain.
   U.S. officials have said there was ``substantial evidence'' that
Iran planted a mine that heavily damaged the hull missile frigate
USS Samuel B. Roberts in the central gulf last week and injured 10
crewmen.
   The injured crewmen were injured and flown by helicopter to a
medical facility aboard the USS Trenton.
   The four most seriously injured were moved to Bahrain's
Salmaniya Hospital and later flown aboard a special U.S. Air Force
jet to West Germany for further treatment and reunion with families.
   The frigate was towed to the Dubai ship repair yard on Saturday,
and knowledgeable sources said it was not in danger of sinking,
despite enormous damage to the hull and engine room.
   ``Circumstances of the attack (Monday) on Sassan were very much
similar to those that preceded the shelling of Rostam last
October,'' said one Dubai-based maritime salvage agent, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``After a five-minute warning, the
American guns blazed away at the platform,'' he said of the attack
on Rostam.
   A multinational mine-sweeping effort has found six mines in the
central gulf area where the Samuel B. Roberts was hit on Thursday,
according to U.S. Navy sources. The mine sweeping task force
included six U.S. ocean mine sweepers, four British units, two
Belgium, two Dutch and four Italian.
   The USS Trenton, which is an amphibious transport ship, was
accompanying the task force and acting as the overall command ship.
   U.S. defense officials suspect the mines are recently laid, Navy
sources said. They said the mines looked clean and free of seaweed,
indicating they had not been in the water for long. The sources
said the explosives were contact mines, the same type of mines
previoulsy located.
   The Roberts is part of the U.S. Middle East Force, which was
bolstered in the gulf last summer when Kuwait registered 11 of its
tankers in the United States to entitle them to U.S. Navy
protection against Iranian threats.
   The Bridgeton, the first of the flagged tankers, struck a mine
during the first U.S. escorted tanker convoy last July.
   The Navy then conducted at least 55 other convoys through the
550-mile length of the waterway between Kuwait and the Strait of
Hormuz, outlet of the gulf, without incident.
   The Navy also spearheaded a massive minehunting operation with
the help of its Western allies, and alone located and detonated 45
mines. The allies took care of about 20 more.
   The Western diplomats and shipping executives on Monday said
there might be at least 10 mines in the area 55 miles northeast of
Qatar, aside from the one hit by the Roberts and the two located by
the Navy.
   The area is a major shipping lane for the U.S. convoys and is
frequented by the warships and the tankers.

   ``These actions were taken in response to Iran's recent
resumption of mine laying in international waters and its mine
attack on the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts,'' the presidential
spokesman said.
   ``The government of Iran has repeatedly been warned about the
consequences of such hostile acts,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the actions were preceded by consultations with
congressional leadership and after ``friendly governments'' were
informed.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. actions ``represent a measured response
to Iran's unlawful use of force against the United States and to
Iran's numerous violations of the rights of other non-belligerents
and they constitute a lawful exercise of the United States'
inherent right of self defense'' under the United Nations charter.
   At a hastily called White House briefing, Fitzwater refused to
answer any questions. He did not say whether there had been any
casualties in the attack.

   Drive-by shooters killed a young girl and
wounded four family members in a gang-infested neighborhood as
violence continued despite a police crackdown.
   A gunman got out of a car and fired up to 30 bullets into a home
in the unincorporated east Compton area Sunday night, killing the
6-year-old girl as she watched television with her family in the
living room, authorities said.
   ``Her mother and her father were badly wounded, and so were her
13-year-old brother and her 4-year-old brother,'' sheriff's Deputy
Hal Grant said.
   Authorities had not determined whether gangs were involved in
the attack, but it took place in a grafitti- and bullet-pocked area
that is home to street thugs, Deputy Roger Hom said.
   In another weekend attack, James Conrad Voldseth, 28, of Los
Angeles, was stabbed to death by two gang members during a drug
deal in the San Fernando Valley community of Pacoima, police said.
   The attacks came at the end of a generally quiet weekend of gang
activity. Feared violence associated with the release of the movie
``Colors,'' about Los Angeles street gangs, also failed to
materialize.
   On Saturday night, a 200-member police task force in Los Angeles
fanned out and arrested 147 people, 73 of whom were suspected gang
members, authorities said.
   Police and sheriff's deputies kept up a presence at theaters in
the Los Angeles area showing ``Colors.''
   Unruly crowds at a theater in Colma in Northern California and
at one in San Diego led to cancellation of the film at those
theaters. At the film's opening Friday, minor scuffles prompted 13
arrests in the Los Angeles area.

   The spokesman left the briefing room as reporters clamored for
more information.
   ``We have repeatedly told Iran that we do not desire military
confrontation,'' Fitzwater said in his statement. ``But the
government of Iran should understand that we will protect our ships
and our interests against unprovoked attacks.''
   ``We urgently seek an end to tensions in the region and to the
Iran-Iraq war,'' he said. ``This would benefit the people of both
nations who have suffered so much from the brutal conflict.''
   Fitzwater said the United States is urging Iran to accept a
United Nations Security Council resolution, passed July 20, calling
for a cease-fire in the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   ``Iran has nothing to gain from continuation of the war,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Book of Jewish Humor in Soviet Union Reflects Pain of Minority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent classified ad in an East German
newspaper offered this deal: ``Prepared to exchange a luxury
apartment in East Berlin for a hole in the wall.''
   True? As much as any of the hundreds of anecdotes in a newly
released compilation entitled ``The Jokes of Oppression: The Humor
of Soviet Jews.''
   Jews may not be free in the Soviet Union, but the Jewish joke is
_ it doesn't fear jails or labor camps, escapes detection by the
KGB, targets sacred institutions and venerated leaders, and
permeates every nook of society.
   ``In the absence of an open press in this kind of
claustrophobic, stifled society, where publicly people wear one
kind of face and privately an entirely different type, these jokes
are of great significance,'' says the book's co-author, David
Harris.
   Harris, the Washington representative of The American Jewish
Committee, spent 10 years collecting the jokes from Jews living in
the Soviet Union, Israel, the United States and Europe. His
co-author, Izrail Rabinovich, is a Soviet emigre who teaches at the
Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif.
   ``For Soviet citizens, humor is a private way of coping,
criticizing, distancing themselves. A punch line, just for a moment
or two, permits release of tension and anger that otherwise tends
to build up with no outlet,'' Harris says.
   For Jews, in particular, the jokes reflect the pain of a 2.5
million minority suffering anti-Semitic persecution and
restrictions on emigration, free worship, and the study of Jewish
culture and the Hebrew language.
   Last year about 8,000 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet
Union, although the figures for this year have increased
significantly. Israel estimates that some 400,000 Soviet Jews wish
to leave.
   This joke illustrates frustration with repeated rejections of
emigration requests:
   A Jew named Khaimovich is turned down for an exit visa because
he is in possession of state secrets from his place of work.
``State secrets? You must be kidding. In my field the Americans are
at least 20 years ahead of us,'' he exclaims. ``That's precisely
the secret,'' comes the curt reply.
   The jokes, say the authors, are also embraced widely by non-Jews
who identify with the recurring themes of a hostile bureaucracy,
discontent with the standard of living, memories of Stalinist
terror and frustration with the stifling presence of the Communist
Party.
   For instance, the same Khaimovich is being chastised at a
district party meeting. ``Why weren't you at the last party
meeting?'' asks an official. ``If I had known it was the last, not
only would I have come, but I'd have brought my entire family as
well,'' he replies.
   Or this one: ``What's the difference between Catholicism and
Communism?'' The answer: ``In Catholicism there's life after death.
In Communism there is posthumous rehabilitation.''
   While the humor of other countries doesn't always travel well,
laughter about the Soviet Union is usually culturally translatable
in the United States. President Reagan enjoys telling jokes about
the Russians, and he trots them out periodically at summit meetings
with Soviet leaders.
   ``Americans find it reassuring to laugh at the Soviets. It
reinforces a feeling of political and social superiority toward the
Russians,'' Harris says.
   As a refugee official for Jewish organizations in Europe, Harris
dealt with thousands of emigre Soviets, including Rabinovich, who
arrived in Rome from the Soviet Union in 1976.
   The two men discovered an interest in jokes, and although they
have not seen each other since, they have conducted a prolific
correspondence for some 11 years which yielded a collection of some
2,000 jokes. The book is only a part of the collection.
   Americans familiar with the humor of the ``Borscht Belt'' _
those areas of the United States with large concentrations of East
European Jews _ will likely be a receptive audience for this one:
   Khaim and Abram devised a scheme for crossing the border _
dressed up as a cow. As they approached the border in their
four-legged outfit, Khaim whispered: ``Oy vey, we're in for big
trouble.''
   ``Border guards?'' Abram asked.
   ``No, a bull,'' Khaim whispered.
   Then there are jokes that appeal on the level of superpower
competition.
   An American and a Russian are discussing their countries'
intelligence services. ``The KGB is the best. I hear they've
managed to steal all the designs of the major American weapons
systems for the last 10 years,'' boasts the Russian.
   ``That's nothing, Ivan,'' retorts the American. ``I know for a
fact that the CIA has succeeded in stealing from the Kremlin's safe
the results of all the Soviet elections for the next 10 years.''

<TEXT>
   A federal investigation and one of the busiest
travel weekends of the year combined to make the Eastern Airlines
terminal at Logan International Airport a waiting room for hundreds
of frustrated travelers.
   The Eastern ticketholders were stuck at the airport Sunday for
the third consecutive day that Eastern flights into or out of
Boston were delayed or canceled by mechanical problems.
   ``I'd rather be sitting by the pool than sitting here,'' Jack
Honen said while he waited for his flight to Florida.
   Eastern, which is the focus of a Federal Aviation Administration
investigation into mechanical and safety problems, was trying to
cope with the crowds on one of Boston's busiest travel weekends of
the year.
   ``What you've got is spring break _ they're all headed down
South. You've got Patriot's weekend and you've got the Boston
Marathon. We're busy in and out,'' said Thomas Hannah, Eastern's
manager for departure services.
   Hannah said the delays and cancellations were typical of any
large airline on a busy weekend. ``There's nothing really unusual
about that. You can go to Delta or Piedmont or what have you and
find the same thing,'' he said.
   Piedmont, United and Continental experienced no significant
delays Sunday, reservations clerks reported. A clerk who answered
the phone at Delta said she could not provide any information.
   An incoming Eastern flight Sunday morning from Orlando, Fla.,
was canceled because of equipment problems that required servicing,
Hannah said. A flight from Boston to Miami was delayed several
hours after Eastern mechanics discovered a fuel leak. And a flight
from Boston to Orlando was delayed three hours.
   ``The mechanics found some engine vibrations. They're working on
it,'' Hannah said.
   Hannah said FAA inspectors were in Eastern's Boston hangars
Sunday looking over the airline's planes. But he said the problems
that led to delays and cancellations had been found by Eastern
mechanics, not the inspectors.
   Honen and his family, of Hanover, were among many heading to
Disney World.
   ``If they were responsible for paying for one day of your
vacation that you lost, maybe they'd get their act together,''
Claire Honen said. She passed time playing cards on the floor with
her two children.
   Earlier Sunday, Eastern officials rerouted several dozen
passengers to LaGuardia Airport in New York City because they were
trying to make connections with a Carribean cruise leaving from
Florida. The passengers had to board an Eastern Shuttle to New York
so they could reach Miami.
   Hannah, who is based in Florida, said he came to Boston to help
manage the busy weekend and handle press questions.
   Three Eastern flights out of Logan were canceled Saturday and
two Eastern jets were taken out of service Friday because of
equipment problems, delaying hundreds of travelers.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Sunday that
starting today, his agency was expanding its airplane-by-airplane
inspection of aircraft to Continental Airlines, like Eastern a
subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company.
   Last week, the FAA began checking Eastern, and fined Eastern
$823,000 for violating safety regulations, authorities said.
   On Wednesday, the agency also began examining the finances and
management of the Houston-based Texas Air. Burnley said the
agency's concerns were raised by evidence that Eastern and
Continental airlines ``are under substantial, increasing financial
pressure.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen Mississippi teen-age girls are taking
home lessons in history and culture _ and new friendships _ after a
whirlwind visit that gave them a taste of the big city.
   ``I got to see a lot of things about culture that I didn't even
know about,'' said Chandrika Rankin, 16, one of the wide-eyed
teen-agers from Greenville, Miss., who took part in the weekend
meeting between North and South.
   The Mississippians' visit was sponsored by the Greenville-based
Daisey M. Greene National Association, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to the services of minority youth and elderly.
   It gave new insight to teen-agers in Chicago, too.
   ``We're so much in Chicago that we want to know what life is
like in the outside world,'' said Marlene Seja, 16, who was among a
group of inner-city minority girls from the METRO Achievement
Program that met with the Mississippi visitors. The girls exchanged
addresses and planned to write to each other.
   ``I didn't think they were going to be so modern,'' said Kina
Stone, a ninth grader at Chicago's Whitney Young High School. ``We
thought they were going to have straw hats, overalls and wear no
makeup. But they were pretty much like us.''
   Before they left for home Sunday, the Mississippi girls said
their trip was so short that they wanted to take pieces of Chicago
back with them.
   ``If I could bring one thing from Chicago back to Mississippi,
it would be the Sears Tower, because it's big,'' said Daisy
Jackson, 17, after a look at the 110-story building, the world's
tallest.
   ``I'd bring the whole city ... because we didn't have enough
time to see everything,'' said 15-year-old Loraine Loving.
   Others giggled and said they would rather take back another one
of Chicago's soaring attractions: pro basketall star Michael Jordan.
   The visitors' busy schedule included attending a performance by
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a sightseeing tour of
Chicago, and a stop at the DuSable Museum of African American
History.
   Miss Loving said she was especially impressed with the museum.
   ``I like the in-depthness of the history there,'' said. ``There
is not enough taught in the schools, and it was just there waiting
for you to come and see it.
   ``I learned that a lot of things were invented by the black man,
but because they didn't have the power to get a patent, the white
man had a patent on it,'' she added.
   The weekend trip was the idea of Mary Wiley, a Greenville native
who is chairwoman of the board of the Greene organization. Ms.
Wiley, who now lives in Chicago, said she came up with the idea
during a visit to Greenville, a city of about 39,000.
   ``I thought the Greenville youngsters should be exposed to
culture outside their own environment, and Chicago _ with all the
performing arts here _ is an ideal place,'' she said.
   Miss Jackson said she plans to recommend Chicago to her friends,
and she'd love to return _ on one condition.
   ``As long as I know I can go back home to Greenville,'' she
said. ``I'm used to a slower pace.''

<HEAD>Physicist Who Helped Find Sub-Atomic Particle Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicist Rodney L. Cool, who helped establish
that protons and neutrons are made up of subatomic particles called
quarks, has died at age 68.
   Cool, a professor of experimental high energy physics at
Rockefeller University, died Saturday at New York Hospital, said
Pam Johnson, a hospital administrator. The university said he died
of cancer.
   Cool was respected ``for his scientific insight and also for his
way of dealing with people,'' said Konstantin Goulianos, a
professor of experimental high energy physics at Rockefeller. ``He
was extremely good at discussing problems and getting to the heart
of things.''
   Until the 1950s, neutrons, protons and electrons were thought to
be the fundamental particles of nature.
   But a series of experiments in the 1970s conducted by Cool and
his colleagues at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN)
in Geneva, Switzerland, helped establish quarks as the building
blocks of neutrons and protons.
   Quarks are bound together by an extremely strong force. Cool's
recent research at CERN had been directed toward probing the
properties of the force.
   He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow
of the American Physical Society.
   Born in Platte, S.D., Cool served in the Army from 1942 to 1946,
rising to major and earning a bronze star.
   He received a master's degree in 1947 and a doctorate in 1949
from Harvard University.
   Cool became a research physicist at Brookhaven National
Laboratory and rose to associate director there before joining
Rockefeller University's faculty in 1970 to establish an
experimental physics group.
   Cool is survived by his wife, Margaret, a son, three daughters
and a sister.
   A private service will be held in Marblehead, Mass.

   The dollar closed slightly lower today against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo, while stock prices declined substantially in
slow trading.
   On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market, the dollar closed at
123.78 yen, down 0.35 yen from Friday's close of 124.13 yen. It
opened at 123.83 yen and fluctuated between 123.68 yen and 123.85
yen.
   Volume totaled $4.34 billion, compared with $6.189 billion last
Friday.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the market in Tokyo was quiet with nothing to stimulate it.
   The dealer said the Bank of Japan intervened slightly when the
dollar went down to 123.70 yen, but the intervention did not have
any impact on the market.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which fell 217.78 points Friday, lost 222.12
points to finish the day at 26.671.45 points.
   Volume on the market's first section totaled 550 million shares,
compared with 1 billion shares Friday.
   An official of Nomura Securities Co. said, ``the market was dull
as there were no special news to attract investors.''
   He added that investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines,
watching new moves following last Thursday's report that the U.S.
trade deficit widened in February.
   The official, who also demanded anonymity, said steel,
electrical and auto issues were particularly weak.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Production, Demand for Natural Gas Expected to Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic crude oil production in the 1990s
should be higher than previously expected and demand for natural
gas will be markedly higher, according to the Energy Department's
annual forecast.
   The department's Energy Information Administration said oil
prices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected in
last year's forecast, and natural gas prices will be much lower.
   The import share of U.S. petroleum consumption won't be much
different at the end of the century from what was predicted last
year, EIA said.
   In their annual forecast released last week, the agency's
forecasters significantly raised its prediction for U.S. crude oil
production in the year 2000 from 5.4 million barrels a day to 6.0
million barrels. Last year's production was about 8.3 million
barrels compared with 9.0 million barrels before the 1986 petroleum
price collapse.
   Richard Farmer, in charge of the petroleum forecast, said in an
interview Friday, ``There is no way you can avoid a decline'' in
U.S. production by the year 2000. Any major discoveries off
California or in Alaska, areas where explorers have high hopes,
could not be in significant production before then, he said.

<HEAD>Aspin Blasts B-1B Bomber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee says Congress should consider halting the Air Force
program to upgrade the problem-plagued B-1B bomber because the new
plane will be obsolete.
   ``We should consider now whether it's worth spending any more
money to make the B-1B operable but obsolescent,'' said Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., in a speech released on Sunday.
   The Air Force, in a statement, disputed Aspin's contentions and
noted that he has long opposed the bomber.
   Aspin's comments were contained in a speech which he plans to
give today on the floor of the House. It is the latest in a series
of addresses in which Aspin is outlining the results of a lengthy
investigation by his committee into new atomic weapons begun during
the Reagan presidency.
   The B-1 was killed by President Carter, but Reagan resurrected
it six years ago, saying the nation needed to buy 100 of the
swing-wing planes to replace the aging B-52s as the atomic bombers
in the nation's nuclear arsenal.
   Congress authorized 100 of the B-1Bs for a total cost of $20.5
billion, but the Air Force now says it will cost up to $3 billion
more to fix ``electronic counter-measures (ECM)'' that will permit
the B-1B to evade Soviet air defenses.
   It will be at least 1991 before the B-1B has the ECM
capabilities it was supposed to have in 1986, according to Aspin.

<HEAD>Study Urges States To Help Fight Money Laundering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study advises state and local
authorities to vigorously pursue money laundering cases against
drug traffickers who frequently dump their illegal profits back
into local communities instead of relying on federal government
investigations.
   The report conducted for the National Institute of Justice by
the Police Executive Research Forum and released Sunday, notes that
money generated by narcotics trafficking and other underworld
activities has been estimated as high as $100 billion annually.
   Only California and Georgia have laws specifically barring
conversion of profits from drugs and other crimes, said the report,
but most states do have effective though rarely utilized laws which
can be used to prosecute money laundering operations.
   State and local law enforcement agencies rely on the federal
government to investigate complex money laundering cases because
such operations often are international in scope.
   But offenders at the lower levels of criminal groups are capable
of generating enormous sums that require laundering, ``and for the
same reasons that international traffickers and syndicate
racketeers need such services,'' concluded the report by the police
forum's associate director, Clifford Karchmer.
   Money launderers convert cash from illegal activities to a form
that conceals its origin and true ownership.

<HEAD>Group Says Overpopulation Could Spur Environmental Catastrophe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earth faces environmental catastrophe unless
developing nations stem rapid overpopulation, a population control
group warned, but a critic dismissed the report as invalid
speculation by humorless doomsayers.
   ``World population, now 5.1 billion, grew by an unprecedented 90
million people last year. Over the next 10 years, the world will
add another billion people. Ninety-two percent of that growth is
taking place in the poorer nations of the developing world,'' said
the report released Sunday by the Population Institute.
   ``Unless we wake up to the serious damage population pressures
are doing to this planet, we will see a 21st century that could
offer unprecedented catastrophic consequences,'' said Werner
Fornos, the group's president.
   Fornos said the thinning of Earth's protective ozone shield;
heating of the atmosphere by industrial pollutants; waste and
pollution of water supplies; loss of soils and forests; extinction
of species; and expansion of deserts ``are all tied directly to
rapid world population growth.''
   He said the United States and other industrialized nations
should consider forgiving debts of developing nations that
establish policies to halt environmental destruction and to expand
educational and employment opportunities for women. Birth rates are
lower where women have greater economic and social opportunities,
Fornos said.
   The report drew sharp criticism from Julian Simon, a University
of Maryland economist, who said that while ``more people mean more
problems, the history of humanity is a history of surmounting
problems. New solutions leave us better off than if the original
problems had never arisen. If we had only 1 million people on
Earth, we'd still be chasing rabbits and eating berries and roots.''
   ``The Population Institute and other doomsayers have been wrong
on every single prediction they have made for the past two
decades,'' and people like Fornos ``have no sense of humor'' and
``can manufacture scares faster than you can write stories about
them'' said Simon, a business administration professor.
   ``Contrary to their prophecies, every important human trend has
improved,'' he said during a telephone interview. ``Life is longer,
health is better, all resources have become more available rather
than less available and in the United States our environment has
become cleaner.''
   Kingsley Davis, a demographer at Stanford University and the
University of Southern California, defended the report, saying,
``There's no question in my mind that virtually every environmental
problem we have is made worse by the fact we have over 5 billion
people on Earth.''
   Fornos labeled Simon's viewpoint ``baloney'' and ``outrageously
elitist'' because ``when you recognize the next billion people will
come in just nine years, then you understand that competition for
food and resources of this planet will become more intense.''
   Fornos said depletion of Earth's ozone layer will increase skin
cancers and perhaps damage crops and seafoods, while atmospheric
heating will raise sea levels and cause crop failures.
Deforestation is likely to create more deserts, spur droughts,
trigger extinctions and reduce oxygen production, while industrial
pollution and human wastes will taint more water supplies, he added.
   To stem the environmental damage, Fornos also recommended:
   _Researchers should accelerate efforts to develop alternatives
to wood, coal and oil as energy sources, because the use of such
fuels spurs deforestation, expansion of deserts and carbon dioxide
pollution that warms the atmosphere.
   _Industrial nations could provide more financial aid to
developing countries that try to limit the flow of migrants into
polluted ``mega-cities,'' which often lack adequate sewage and
waste disposal systems.
   _Nations that ratified the treaty to reduce emissions of
chlorofluorocarbons _ the refrigerant gases blamed for depletion of
Earth's ozone layer _ should reconvene to move up their 1994
deadline for cutting such emissions in half.

<HEAD>Contras Reject Sandinista Truce Proposal, But Talks Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contra rebel leaders said they
rejected a government proposal for a permanent truce because the
document failed to spell out the democratic reforms the Sandinistas
would adopt.
   Government negotiators offered the plan Sunday during the third
day of cease-fire talks, the first held in Managua since fighting
broke out in 1981.
   Although the rebels rejected the government offer, both sides
returned to the bargaining table and met Sunday night and into
today behind closed doors at the Camino Real Hotel on the outskirts
of Managua.
   Before talks resumed Sunday, the Contras said the Sandinistas
must take steps _ or at least guarantee them during a truce _ to
return Nicaragua to democratic, elected rule. ``We reject the
Sandinista proposal because it speaks only of cease-fire and no
other issues, such as the true democratization of Nicaragua,'' said
Adolfo Calero, head of the rebel delegation.
   ``For us, the permanent truce should come about simultaneously
with the process of democratizing Nicaragua, and that is why the
Sandinista proposal is a regression,'' Calero said.
   ``It is dangerous,'' said another Contra leader, Alfredo Cesar.
``It does not mention how the cease-fire will be implemented.''
   The defense chief, Gen. Humberto Ortega, described the proposal
in a news conference as ``reasonable, mature and flexible.''
   As soon as a permanent truce is signed, he said, eight leaders
of the Contra umbrella organization known as the Nicaraguan
Resistance can join representatives of the 14 legally recognized
opposition political parties in a ``national reconciliation''
dialogue with the Sandinistas.
   The defense chief, President Daniel Ortega's brother, claimed
the Sandinistas had already defeated the U.S.-supported Contras,
but were not demanding unconditional surrender. ``Only in
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movies is war ended by smashing the enemy with
a club,'' he said.
   Modern wars, he said, are ended ``by negotiating political and
other matters to arrive at an accord. That is the way it was in
Vietnam.''
   After receiving the government plan, the Contras discussed it
for four hours before calling a news conference to announce they
had rejected it.
   The two sides agreed on March 23 to a preliminary peace plan
that called for a 60-day cease-fire to give the negotiators time to
work out a permanent truce. The cease-fire, which went into effect
on April 1, calls for the rebels to gather in seven zones. But the
two sides have not yet been able to work out such details as how
the rebels will be resupplied, whether they can keep their weapons
and how the truce will be verified.
   In an editorial printed Sunday, the opposition newspaper La
Prensa said, ``A permanent truce means the Sandinistas should be
willing to bury totalitarism and give up their ideal of ruling with
a single party.''
   ``If they insist on a truce just to dismember the Nicaraguan
Resistance, leaving intact the Sandinista's political-military
regime, then there will be no peace or development not only in
Nicaragua but throughout Central America.
   ``If the Nicaraguan Resistance surrenders its weapons before an
effective democratization is achieved, it will be betraying the
democratic aspirations of Nicaraguans and the bloodshed by those
who died yesterday, today, before and after 1979,'' the editorial
said.
   La Prensa, which the Sandinistas have closed several times for
criticizing the government, is Nicaragua's only opposition
newspaper.
   The Sandinistas seized power in July 1979 after a bloody
revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed government of right-wing
President Anastasio Somoza.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a commuter plane that crashed
in flames shortly after takeoff at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport said he knew he had only one chance to save himself and the
39 others aboard.
   ``There wasn't much time available,'' said Carl Carlson, who
headed in for an emergency landing even though he knew he was too
high and going too fast.
   The burning Horizon Air plane stopped after it collided with a
concourse passenger ramp Friday and the crisis ended in a shower of
firefighting foam.
   All 40 people aboard Flight 2658 from Seattle to Spokane, Wash.,
survived. Only three of the 19 injured remained hospitalized early
today, one in serious condition.
   Carlson, 38, and co-pilot Mark Hilstad, both of the Portland
area, were interviewed here Sunday by National Transportation
Safety Board investigators.
   Neither man, nor the NTSB investigators, would comment to
reporters after the closed meeting. But in remarks overheard by
reporters outside the meeting, Carlson said he first knew the plane
was in trouble when he experienced an ``overall sense'' of
decreasing responsiveness in the plane's controls.
   Instruments then indicated the right engine was losing from 40
percent to 60 percent of its torque, the pilots said.
   Carlson said he immediately radioed for permission to return to
the airport and began a series of three turns to bring the
twin-engine de Havilland Dash 8 back in line with the runway.
   As he was heading into the final turn, Carlson said, Hilstad
lowered the landing gear and then shouted that the right engine was
on fire.
   ``I quickly saw the red fire warning light,'' Carlson said,
adding the flames were not visible from his side of the cockpit.
   Hilstad described the fire as a big reddish ball of flame
protruding forward from the wing. He said it appeared while the
plane was at about 2,000 feet, going 205 to 230 mph.
   NTSB investigators have said that an initial review of tapes of
tower communications with the plane indicated the first mention of
fire came from another aircraft that was not immediately identified.
   Carlson and Hilstad said they remembered hearing the warning
over the radio as they discovered the problem themselves.
   Hilstad said he triggered two fire extinguisher bottles but they
had no effect.
   Carlson said he quickly experienced trouble with the controls.
   As they were starting down, the pilots said, they realized they
were too high and were going too fast but they had no choice except
to land.
   ``I felt like it was wallowing, teetering, going to stall,''
Hilstad said.
   Carlson said he thought he was still in a comfortable range to
maneuver the plane to a stop. He and Hilstad applied full force to
the brakes and rudder and locked the emergency brake, but could not
avoid ramming a runway identification sign and hitting the
passenger ramp.
   ``I remember the Horizon ramp going by at blinding speed,'' he
said. ``The next thing I knew we were being showered by foam.''
   Both men said their preflight checks showed nothing wrong with
the airplane, and everything was normal through the takeoff.
   Joseph T. Nall, an NTSB investigator, said Sunday night at a
Seattle news conference that a passenger spotted fuel on the
plane's wing before the blaze erupted.
   Nall said the two cockpit recorders would be ``read out'' only
after they arrive at a laboratory in Washington, D.C.
   Rick Smith, chief of the Port of Seattle Fire Department at the
airport, praised the flight crew and the fire crew on the ground.
He watched a videotape of the landing and crash made by an airport
camera.
   ``Had it not been for the quick application of foam and their
(the fire crews') efforts, we could easily have lost 40 people, a
jetway, and had an extension of fire on the concourse,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. And Europe Far Apart On Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four trade ministers
responsible for two-thirds of the world's commerce made little
progress on farm subsidies and Japanese trade barriers when they
discussed drafting new global trading rules.
   ``Progress in this particular session has certainly not been
significant,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on
Sunday.
   He was referring mostly to the billions of dollars spent
subsidizing the world's farmers to produce exports no one wants to
buy.
   Envoys from the United States, Japan, Canada and the 12-nation
European Community said they found some agreement during the
weekend meeting at a secluded retreat, but made little headway on
issues dividing them.
   Yeutter repeated the Reagan administration's call for an end of
farm subsidies by the year 2000 and an agreement by December
establishing a framework for phasing them out.
   ``Our friends in Europe consider that an unrealistic objective,
but we fail to comprehend why that should be construed as such,''
Yeutter told a news conference.
   ``If 12 years is too soon, then let's look at 14 years. But
let's not conclude it's impossible to rid the world of these
onerous practices.''
   He said EEC Trade Commissioner Willy de Clercq kept ``his cards
close to his vest'' on the issue during the Quadrilateral Trade
Meeting on Quadra Island, a tree-lined retreat 100 miles northwest
of Vancouver.
   At a news conference, however, de Clercq said the EEC had taken
a ``courageous'' decision to begin curbing farm production and
spending.
   The EEC commissioner termed U.S. proposals unreasonable and
accused the Reagan administration of talking free trade while
practicing the opposite.
   ``Both of us spend about $30 billion (a year) to support
farming. There are about 2.5 to 3 million farmers in the United
States and 12 million in the European Community. It's not difficult
to draw the conclusion which farmers are more supported,'' de
Clercq said.
   He said under one U.S. program, nearly 12 million tons of
subsided wheat have been sold to the Soviet Union in the past year.
   De Clercq said any agreement on agriculture must be part of a
``global package'' under the 95-nation General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, which is being renegotiated in Geneva. The agreement
pledges its members to free trade. That package should cover such
topics as investment, services and improved access for Third World
goods, he said.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said he hoped for a
compromise on farm subsidies by the GATT midterm review meeting set
for next December in Montreal.
   ``We would like to get agreement on a freeze on any further
steps in this direction,'' he said.
   Canada, Australia and other farm exporting nations complain
their treasuries cannot match U.S. and EEC spending power.
   While the troubled GATT negotiations dominated weekend
discussions, bilateral differences were aired.
   With Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura at his side, Yeutter
chastised Japan for failing to relax its restrictive quotas on U.S.
beef and citrus products. He urged the Japanese government to work
harder on overcoming the powerful farm lobby opposed to more
agricultural imports.
   ``Japan's unwillingness to resolve this issue ... has generated
a lot of emotion in Congress,'' he said.
   Yeutter said on Friday that the Reagan administration remains
confident the Free Trade Agreement, which would begin in January
1989 and dismantle all tariffs over a 10-year period, will be
approved by Congress this year.

<TEXT>
   The drowning of a newborn girl in a toilet at a
state psychiatric hospital could not have been foreseen, a state
official says.
   But mental health advocates say it points out the problems of
underfunded, understaffed hospitals.
   The girl, born Tuesday night to a patient at the Chicago-Read
Mental Health Center, died by drowning, an autopsy showed. The
infant was found in the toilet about 15 minutes after staff members
had checked the mother in her bed, said David Devane, spoeksman for
the state Department of Mental Health.
   The staff check around 8 p.m. showed the woman, who was nine
months pregnant, was ``resting comfortably with no indication of
rapid breathing or anything to indicate labor,'' Devane said Sunday.
   Staff members found the infant after they saw blood on the lower
part of the mother's body, Devane said.
   ``The trail of blood went back to the bathroom,'' he said.
   Devane said the 34-year-old woman, identified by police as
Patricia Ales, was checked every 15 minutes because of her
pregnancy. He declined to discuss her mental condition.
   Chicago Police Sgt. Thomas Czarnecki said an autopsy determined
that the baby had drowned. He said he did not expect charges to be
filed against the mother.
   Mental health advocates questioned how a woman could give birth
unnoticed in a crowded hospital unit.
   ``I find it incredible that this could happen and nobody knew
she was in labor,'' said Jan Holcomb, former president of the
Mental Health Association in Illinois, a private advocacy group.
   ``Does it take the death of a newborn baby to recognize that our
underfunded and understaffed state mental health facilities can
pose a threat to the health and safety of our most vulnerable
citizens?''
   Devane said the staff did everything possible.
   ``There were four people on the unit, four staff members,''
Devane said. ``She (the mother) was under close observation and
that close observation had been followed.''
   The woman had been examined by her obstetrician at the
University of Illinois' downtown clinic earlier that day, Devane
said. The doctor did not indicate any need for her to go to a
maternity ward, he said.
   The Chicago Tribune reported that fire department paramedics
responded to a call of ``woman in labor'' at 8:14 p.m. When they
arrived, the newspaper said, they were first directed to the
mother, who was hemorrhaging, and then were told by an unidentified
staff member that a baby was in the bathroom toilet, police records
show.

   A smoky electrical fire in an overhead luggage
compartment of a Continental Airlines jet forced the 103 passengers
to use emergency chutes to evacuate after it landed at Cleveland
Hopkins International Airport.
   Six of the 103 passengers aboard the Boeing 737 were treated at
two hospitals for smoke inhalation.
   Continental Airlines spokesman Bruce Hicks said Flight 159 was
bound for Cleveland from Newark, N.J., when smoke was detected
during the final minutes of Sunday night's flight.
   ``It was a safe landing. We just evacuated the cabin to make
absolutely sure that everyone was safe,'' Hicks said.
   The fire was extinguished by airport firefighters.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the fire was caused by a short in the wires
powering lights above the seats. The wires are located behind a
liner in the overhead storage bins.
   Passenger Peter Munro of Boston said he did not see any flames
but saw a lot of smoke.
   ``The smoke was waist high and higher in the front of the plane.
In the back, it was completely black. It was pretty frantic,'' said
Munro.

   A woman handed Jimmy Swaggart a $20,000
check during church services, prompting the disgraced evangelist to
joke ``I didn't bilk her.''
   The woman, introduced by Pastor Jim Rentz only as Anna, was
singing in the choir Sunday when she walked to the pulpit and said
Swaggart helped her find Jesus. The woman then gave him the check,
which he quickly handed to another minister on the stage of the
Family Worship Center.
   ``For the benefit of all the news media, I didn't bilk her out
of it,'' Swaggart said.
   Swaggart told the woman to give him a kiss, and pointed to his
cheek.
   ``My wife won't care,'' he said.
   The woman kissed Swaggart, hugged his wife, Frances, and
returned to the choir.
   Aside from a few times when he took the microphone to sing,
Swaggart made no other comments at the service.
   He has not preached since his Feb. 21 tearful confession of
sinning against his wife.

   Calling Gov. John Sununu contemptuous of
New Hampshire, Democrat Paul McEachern announced his third bid to
become the state's chief executive.
   ``New Hampshire is not a franchise _ to be opened for
development _ but a place to be protected as we pass,'' McEachern,
a Portsmouth lawyer, told several hundred cheering supporters
Sunday at Pembroke Academy.
   McEachern accused the Republican governor of turning his back on
education, giving the state away to developers and relying too much
on the ``nuclear pellet'' with his continued support of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   McEachern, 50, twice mentioned his opposition to finished but
unlicensed Seabrook.
   McEachern, who expects to be unopposed in the September primary,
lost to Sununu by 8 percentage points in 1986.

   A specially designed cockpit
wasn't enough to save two powerboat racers who were killed when
their boat hit the peak of a wave and flipped, authorities and
witnesses said.
   The Spirit of Miss Liberty, racing Saturday in the Sportsman D
class of larger boats, was traveling nearly 100 mph in the Gulf of
Mexico less than 1,000 feet offshore when it crashed, witnesses
said.
   ``It was one of the fastest boats out there,'' said Panama City
Beach resident Jack Woodliff.
   Killed in the accident were the boat's owner and pilot, Thomas
Brandt of Gulf Stream, and the throttleman, Don Wright of Fort
Lauderdale, police said. Their ages were unavailable.
   The boat's enclosed cockpit reportedly was designed to lessen
the impact in case of an accident and was believed to improve the
aerodynamics of the 30-foot Chris Craft.

<HEAD>White House Calls Shelling a ``Measured Response'' to Iran's
Mining</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Fixes typo in 2d graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, retaliating for the mining
of a U.S. Navy frigate, ordered the shelling of Iranian offshore
oil platforms in the Persian Gulf Monday in what the White House
called ``a measured response to Iran's unlawful use of force.''
   The United States had said there was ``substantial evidence''
that Iran had planted a mine that blew a hole in the side of the
USS Samuel B. Roberts in the central Gulf last week and injured 10
crewmen.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there were no
American casualties in the shelling and the United States did not
know of any on the Iranian side.
   Fitzwater said Reagan decided on the attack Sunday night during
meetings in the residence section of the White House.
   He said Reagan met with Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
National Security Adviser Colin Powell and others at 8:30 p.m. EDT
Sunday, then briefed congressional leaders and met with his
advisers for ``fine tuning'' of the decision.
   The spokesman said he did not know how many people were aboard
the platforms, although they normally have a complement of 20 to 40
men. They are manned by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. He said they
were given several minutes warning to leave, and some were seen
leaving.
   Fitzwater said the frigates Simpson and Bagley and the cruiser
Wainwright took part in the attack on the Sirri platform, which he
said is 18 miles off Sirri island. He said the destroyers Merril
and McCormick and the landing platform ship Trenton, which carries
helicopters, took part in the attack on the Sassan.
   He said there was no indication of resistance. The platforms
were still burning about three hours after the attack.
   Fitzwater said the Sassan platform had been boarded by Marines,
who were setting charges to destroy it.
   Fitzwater said four Iranian F4 fighters took off during the
attack, but returned to their base without firing. He said aircraft
from the U.S. aircraft carrier Enterprise were in the air during
the shelling, but he did not know whether they took any part. He
said he understood all of the firing was from the ships.
   Fitzwater said the attack represented ``a measured response to
Iran's unlawful use of force against the United States and to
Iran's numerous violations of the rights of other non-belligerents.
And they constitute a lawful excerise of the United States'
inherent right of self defense under Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.''
   Reagan first met with top advisers on Friday to decide upon a
response to the mining of the Roberts, a guided missile frigate
which came close to sinking.
   The incident was the second of its nature since the United
States began escorting oil tankers through the gulf on July 21,
1987 to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the
7{-year Iran-Iraqn war.
   On Oct. 19, a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack
on a Kuwaiti ship flying the U.S. flag in which 18 Americans were
injured. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what Reagan
termed a ``prudent'' response.
   Reporters were summoned to the White House for a 2:30 a.m. EDT
briefing on Monday. By time it was under way, an hour later, news
reports on the shelling had been received from the Persian Gulf.
   In a written statement, Fitzwater said, ``The government of Iran
should understand that we will protect our ships and our
interests'' against such attacks.
   ``These platforms are used as command and control radar stations
for the Iranian military,'' he said of the targets.
   ``The government of Iran has repeatedly been warned about the
consequences of such hostile acts'' as the mining of the Gulf, he
said.
   Fitzwater said the ``friendly governments'' had been informed in
advance.
   ``We have repeatedly told Iran that we do not desire military
confrontation,'' Fitzwater said. ``But the government of Iran
should understand that we will protect our ships and our interests
against unprovoked attacks.''
   ``We urgently seek an end to tensions in the region and to the
Iran-Iraq war,'' he said. ``This would benefit the people of both
nations who have suffered so much from the brutal conflict.''
   Fitzwater said the United States is urging Iran to accept a
United Nations Security Council resolution, passed July 20, calling
for a cease-fire in the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   ``Iran has nothing to gain from continuation of the war,'' he
said.

   An overfilled railroad tank car dumped
hundreds of gallons of a toxic chemical, forming a gaseous cloud
that sent some 200 people to the hospital with eye irritations and
breathing difficulties, officials say.
   The spill at a Monsanto Co. plant about 12:15 p.m. Sunday forced
the evacuation of hundreds of East St. Louis families as the
chemical cloud drifted over the southern part of that city, just
north of the plant, authorities said.
   Monsanto officials said the spill occurred when a railroad tank
car being loaded with phosphorous trichloride was overfilled,
spilling 250 to 300 gallons of the chemical. The chemical turns to
hydrochloric acid when it hits the air.
   People suffering from eye or respiratory problems were treated
at St. Mary's Hospital but none was admitted, said Rose Lusk, a
nursing supervisor. Among those treated were seven firefighters.
   Emergency crews sprayed the chemical cloud with water for about
an hour before it dissipated. Residents were allowed to return to
their homes about 3 p.m.
   Phosphorous trichloride is used to produce agricultural and
water-treatment chemicals, Monsanto spokesman Glynn Young said.
Exposure to the chemical does not cause long-term health problems,
Young said.

<HEAD>New Hampshire Digging Out From Snowy Onslaught</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New Hampshire dug out from more than a foot of snow today and
Idaho cleaned up debris left by two tornadoes as much of the nation
was hit by scattered showers and heavy thunderstorms.
   A storm turned New Hampshire's north country into a winter
wonderland Sunday, dumping up to 14 inches of snow in the lowlands
and more than 33 inches atop Mount Washington.
   Meteorologist Chris Norcross said Mount Washington's 6,288-foot
peak received 33.5 inches of snow, with light snow likely to
continue for several days. Pittsburg, in northernmost New
Hampshire, reported 14 inches, Dixville Notch 12 inches and
Crawford and Pinkham notches 8 inches.
   Thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in Idaho on Sunday night. One
tornado touched down near in the southeastern town of Ririe,
destroying a shed and carrying a telephone pole across a field. The
second tornado struck south of nearby Roberts.
   Meanwhile, thunderstorms moving slowly across the lower
Mississippi Valley produced 1-inch sized hail and damaging winds in
Louisiana on Sunday. The winds downed numerous trees in Bienville
County.
   But skies were fair over the southern and mid-Atlantic states
early this morning, as well as over the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley.
   The forecast for today called for showers and thunderstorms
across the Southeastern, the Tennessee Valley and the Carolinas
into the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states; showers from
the upper Ohio Valley, New England, the Pacific Northwest, and
south into the central inter-mountain region and Arizona; and snow
across Michigan.
   High temperatures will be in the 50s or 60s across much of the
nation; in the 30s across the northern Great Lakes; in the 40s from
the northern Plains into the lower Great Lakes and over northern
Maine; in the 70s from the Southern California valleys and desert
Southwest, and from west-central Texas through the lower
Mississippi Valley into the southern Atlantic coast; in the 80s
across much of Florida and from the Louisiana coast into southern
Texas; and near 90 in parts of the lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 19 at
Bismarck, N.D., Fargo, N.D., and Warroad, Minn., to 77 at Laredo,
Texas.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 62 partly cloudy; Boston 48 fair; Buffalo 46

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Air Force F-16
fighter jet crashed today in a field near the West German border
with Luxembourg, slightly injuring the pilot when he ejected, an
Air Force spokeswoman said.
   It was third crash of a fighter plane over the densely populated
country since March 30. A U.S. Army helicopter also crashed earlier
this month.
   ``A U.S. Air Force F-16C crashed near Erzberg at 9:10 a.m. (3:10
a.m. EDT),'' staff Sgt. Linda Brandon said. Erzberg is a small
village located near the West German border with Luxembourg. She
said the aircraft ``was on a low-level training mission at the time
of the crash.''
   The pilot ejected safely from the F-16 before the craft plowed
into an open field. Ms. Brandon said he was taken to the U.S.
Army's Landsthul hospital near Kaiserslautern in southwestern West
Germany.
   ``He suffered no serious injuries but is being kept for
observation,'' Brandon said. The pilot was not immediately
identified.
   Brandon, reading from a statement, said the aircraft was
assigned to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing, which is based at
Ramstein Air Base, also near Kaiserslautern.
   ``A board of officers will investigate the accident,'' said
Brandon.
   She said additional details would be provided ``as they become
available.'' It was the second crash of a U.S. Air Force fighter
since March 31, when an F-16C went down in the town of Forst, 12
miles north of Karlsruhe.
   That crash killed the pilot, 24-year-old Lt. Thomas Edward Doyle
of Oroville, Calif., and a West German resident on the ground. The
crash also demolished three houses.
   A day earlier, a French Mirage crashed less than one mile from a
nuclear power plant in Bavaria, killing the French air force pilot.
   On April 5, a U.S. Army lieutenant and West German employee of
the Army died when an Army helicopter crashed. The American was
identified as 1st Lt. Glen P. Adams, 28.
   West German anti-nuclear activists have demanded restrictions on
military flights over the nation, as has the Association of German
Aviation, a private pilots' organization.

<TEXT>
   John Demjanjuk is the second man to be tried in
Israel for Nazi war crimes. In 1961, a special court heard the case
of Adolf Eichmann, found him guilty and sentenced him to death.
   A year later, Eichmann was hanged, the only person to have been
executed in Israel's 40-year history.
   Although Demjanjuk could suffer Eichmann's fate, there are many
differences between the two men and their trials.
   Above all, there was no doubt about Eichmann's guilt.
   His Nazi wartime record was well documented. He was considered a
high-ranking leader of the Nazi regime and was the man in charge of
carrying out his government's orders to exterminate European Jewry.
   Unlike Demjanjuk, Eichmann never denied committing the wartime
deeds of which he was accused. Also, Eichmann's trial was held 17
years after the end of the war, when the memory of the Holocaust
was still fresh and many of those who survived it still alive.
   His presence aroused so much anger in Israel that the
authorities built a bulletproof glass booth to protect him during
the open-court proceedings in Jerusalem.
   The Israeli government regarded the trial as an historic
settling of accounts with the Nazi movement. Eichmann was regarded
not only as a man who had committed unspeakable crimes, but also as
a symbol of the entire Nazi regime which was being brought to
justice by the Jewish people.
   The accused contributed to the sense of national outrage in
Israel by his demeanor. He observed his trial in silence, with a
sardonic smile on his face, and never expressed regret for his
deeds.
   The Austrian-born Eichmann became the perfect stereotype of the
cold and ruthless Nazi killing machine.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Nervous Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today amid fears of central bank intervention if the American
currency moves lower. Gold prices were slightly higher.
   Market sentiment remains extremely bearish toward the dollar
because of disappointment over the widened February trade deficit,
dealers said.
   Traders ``are not touching the dollar, afraid that the central
banks might step in,'' said one Rome dealer on condition of
anonymity. ``The dollar is only moving as a result of cross
trading.''
   Traders noted that banks intervened heavily in support of the
U.S. currency after the trade figures were released last week.
   Britain's pound sterling continued strong on high interest rates.
   ``People are wondering whether we'll see another base rate cut
in Britain this week, though I'm not expecting one,'' one dealer at
a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said.
   A cut in the basic interest rate would make the pound less
attractive to buyers and strengthen the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.35 yen to a closing 123.78. But later, in
London, it rose to 124.40 yen, higher than Friday's close of 124.13
yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates:
   _1.6625 West German marks, up from 1.6605
   _1.3750 Swiss francs, up from 1.3720
   _5.6455 French francs, up from 5.6325
   _1.85885 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8630
   _1,231.00 Italian lire, down from 1,232.50
   _1.2305 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2335
   In London, the British pound rose against the dollar. It cost
$1.8925 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.889 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $456.75 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $457.55. Both were higher than Friday's late
bid of $456.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $457, up from $455.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.03 to close at a bid $457.98.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.515 a
troy ounce, up from Friday's $6.49.

<TEXT>
   The following is a summary of prosecution and
defense arguments in the Nazi war crimes trial of John Demjanjuk:
   
   THE PROSECUTION:
   The prosecution claims Demjanjuk is ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a
brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at
the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   Prosecutors presented five Treblinka survivors who identified
Demjanjuk as ``Ivan'' in photo lineups that included a 1952 picture
of the defendant and another taken from his alleged Nazi identity
card.
   Survivor Pinchas Epstein pointed to Demjanjuk in court and said
he recognized the defendant's walk, while survivor Eliyahu
Rosenberg said he remembered Demjanjuk's ``murderous eyes.''
   The prosecution's most pivotal evidence was Demjanjuk's alleged
Nazi identity card. Issued at Trawniki, a training camp for death
camp guards, the document does not mention Treblinka but states
Demjanjuk was posted at the nearby Sobibor death camp.
   Six prosecution experts authenticated the paper, ink, photograph
and signatures on the Trawniki card. One expert produced a video
showing how the photograph of the young guard on the card matched
the present-day Demjanjuk almost exactly. In addition, two
historians vouched for the document's historical authenticity.
   In a grueling week-long cross-examination, prosecutors showed
inconsistencies in Demjanjuk's version of his whereabouts during
World War II and accused him of hiding his true identity.
   
   THE DEFENSE:
   Demjanjuk claims he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity
and says he was a Nazi prisoner-of-war during the years of
Treblinka's operation, 1942-43.
   Demjanjuk admits he lied on his U.S. immigration application,
saying he was a Polish farmer rather than a Ukrainian soldier, but
he insists it was because he feared forced repatriation to the
Soviet Union and not because he was hiding a Nazi past.
   A psychology expert raised doubts about the reliability of the
Treblinka survivors' memories more than 40 years after the
Holocaust. He also contended the photo lineups were biased against
Demjanjuk because his picture was the largest, clearest and the
only one of a bald man.
   Demjanjuk's attorneys presented 12 statements from Treblinka
inmates who failed to identify Demjanjuk's picture as ``Ivan.''
   Demjanjuk claims the Trawniki card was forged by the Soviet
Union, which provided it and three other other similar documents to
Israel. He says the Soviets wanted to frame Demjanjuk because he
served in an anti-Communist unit organized by the Germans at the
end of World War II.
   The defense also called six experts who contended the Trawniki
card was forged. One document expert said the paper could not have
been produced in Nazi Germany because it was made of rags, a
material that was scarce during World War II.
   Defense witnesses also said Demjanjuk's signature on the card
was forged and contended the picture on the document, even if it
portrayed Demjanjuk, was not the original but had been glued on at
a later date.
   Several defense witnesses were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were called into question.
   Some defense witnesses also offered bizarre arguments, including
one who claimed the Soviet secret service used ``thought power'' to
kill its enemies and inflict disasters on the West.

   John Demjanjuk, the second man to be tried in
Israel for Nazi war crimes, says he is a simple man with a
fourth-grade education who survived near-starvation in the Soviet
Ukraine by eating birds, rats and a pet cat.
   ``My tragic mistake is I can't think properly. I don't know how
to answer,'' the retired Ohio autoworker told an Israeli court in a
revealing moment.
   Demjanjuk has become more human to many Israelis than Adolf
Eichmann, the first man to stand trial for Nazi war crimes, because
he learned some Hebrew and his family attended nearly every session.
   The Israeli prosecution says Demjanjuk is ``Ivan the Terrible,''
who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka
death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   During the trial, Demjanjuk chatted with police guards, laughed
good naturedly during sessions and shouted the Hebrew greeting
``Shalom'' to bystanders as he was led handcuffed to and from court.
   He even tried to shake hands with a Treblinka survivor, who
recoiled in horror and called Demjanjuk a murderer.
   Before being yanked into the public eye by charges he was a
brutal Nazi guard, the 68-year-old grandfather lived a quiet life
centered on family and friends in Cleveland's close-knit Ukrainian
community, where Demjanjuk emigrated in 1952.
   When he took the stand in Israel, Demjanjuk endeavored to win
sympathy by describing his own hardships in the Soviet Ukraine and
portraying himself as a mild-mannered man who ``couldn't even kill
a chicken.''
   ``Me and my relatives were forced to eat birds, mice, rats and
even our pet cat,'' Demjanjuk said of his childhood in the Ukraine
in 1932 and 1933.
   The balding defendant tried to explain away inconsistencies in
his version of his whereabouts during World War II by blaming his
lack of education and faulty memory.
   ``What do you expect when I had only four years of schooling?''
he said in helpless frustration during a grueling weeklong
cross-examination last August.
   Demjanjuk's three children describe their father as a patient,
good-natured man who tried to make life more homey in his dreary
Israeli isolation cell by hanging hundreds of cards from
well-wishers and family photographs onto the walls.
   Alone in his prison cell, Demjanjuk lifted his spirits by
reading from a Ukrainian-language Bible and doing sit-ups and
push-ups to relieve tension, his children said in interviews.
   Demjanjuk and his wife, Vera, 62, worked long factory shifts to
attain a measure of the good life. They bought a house in the
middle-class Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills, where Demjanjuk
planted a garden and planned to retire.
   ``My dad enjoyed seeing things grow. He was squeamish about
killing anything, even worms in the garden,'' said Demjanjuk's
daughter, Irene Nishnic, 28.
   On Aug. 25, 1977, the first accusations against Demjanjuk
appeared in the U.S. media.
   After a six-week trial in Feb. 1981 in a U.S. District Court in
Cleveland, when Demjanjuk admitted lying to immigration authorites,
he was stripped of his U.S. citizenship.
   He was extradited to Israel in February 1986 and his
14-month-long trial began one year later.
   Describing her father, Mrs. Nishnic said: ``My dad is a good
man, a loving man. He's never beat on me, he's never hurt me. But
that's not going to make any difference, is it?''

<HEAD>Top-Secret Satellite Costs May be Rocketing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ultra-secret multi-satellite program
intended to help coordinate the nation's nuclear weapons appears to
be facing serious problems, including budget overruns and technical
obstacles, a newspaper reported.
   The San Jose Mercury News said the 5-year-old MILSTAR program at
Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. is supposed to be tough enough to
survive an all-out war, smart enough to run itself for six months
at a time and sophisticated enough to link just about every ship,
plane and battlefield unit with a nuclear weapon.
   But a congressional report prepared in December reported
``pervasive problems'' and cost overruns in MILSTAR, which is short
for military strategic and tactical relay system, the newspaper
said in its Sunday editions.
   The report blamed the problems on ``repeated changes in
acquisition schedules, inadequate funding, poor contracting
procedures and a lack of management attention at the senior levels
of the Department of Defense and Air Force.''
   ``Hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as a billion
dollars, could be wasted over the next decade,'' it warned.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified congressional source as
saying contracts weren't written to encourage Lockheed and its
subcontractors enough to save money. Fluctuations in Air Force
financing led to inefficiencies on the production lines, the source
said.
   ``There were an awful lot of problems,'' said the source, who
asked not to be identified. But, the source added, ``that doesn't
mean it's a dog of a program.''
   Congress recently authorized an additional $25 million above
what has been allocated for the project this year. The project's
budget is secret; the newspaper said the budget was ``estimated at
$10 billion or perhaps much more.''
   ``The MILSTAR program, we think, is proceeding well,'' said Lt.
Col. Rick Oborn, a spokesman for the Air Force. ``We do realize
there are some techinical challenges, and there are some minor
setbacks.
   ``But given the technical risks those setbacks are not
insurmountable. It is a program designed as the highest national
priority,'' he said.
   Richard Buenneke, editor of the industry newsletter Military
Space, was more skeptical.
   ``They're obviously using the security around the program to
hide a lot of the problems with it,'' said Buenneke.

   The American warships used to attack two
Iranian oil platforms early this morning included a cruiser and two
destroyers in addition to smaller frigates, according to the
Pentagon.
   The attack on the Sirri oil platform in the gulf was led by the
cruiser Wainwright, a 547-foot warship commissioned in 1966 that
carries a variety of missiles in addition to a five-inch gun.
   The Wainwright attacked along with two frigates, the Simpson and
Bagley. The Simpson is a so-called Oliver Hazard Perry-class ship _
identical to the Samuel B. Roberts, which hit a mine last week. The
Bagley is a much older vessel, commissioned in 1972.
   The Pentagon said the Sassan oil platform was attacked by two
destroyers _ the Merrill and the Lynde McCormick. The two warships
were accompanied by the amphibious landing ship Trenton.
   The Trenton carries helicopters, but it was not immediately
clear whether they had played any role in the attack.
   The Merrill is a so-called Spruance-class destroyer,
commissioned in 1978 and armed with the same type of five-inch guns
as those found on the Wainwright. The Lynde McCormick also carries
five-inch guns for shelling, but is much older. It was commissioned
in 1961.

<HEAD>IP Strikers Vote On Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAY, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikers at International Paper Co. were
voting today on the latest contract offer, but hundreds of workers
already have expressed their disapproval by throwing copies into
the middle of a gymnasium floor in disgust.
   In explaining the proposal to the membership, Local 14 President
William Meserve said IP would not fire replacement workers who have
been hired at the mill.
   Workers ``were quite upset by what they heard,'' union steward
Stephen Blodgett said by telephone after the meeting.
   He said more than 1,000 workers had gathered at the Jay
Community Building to hear from Local 14 President William Meserve
as he outlined the proposal he had brought from Kentucky last week
following negotiations with IP executives.
   Everyone voted individually, but Blodgett said he and the people
around him voted against the latest contract offer in the
10-month-old dispute.
   Union members who did not vote Sunday night could vote today at
the union hall.
   The Jay votes will be pooled with ballots cast by workers
involved in labor disputes at IP mills in three other states. The
final tally will be submitted to the United Paperworkers
International Union headquarters by Friday, said Dennis Couture, a
member of the executive board of UPIU's Local 14.
   Local 14 Vice President Mike Burke said Sunday there was little
question what would happen. ``It's going to be voted down,'' he
said.
   Burke said the company hopes younger union members would ``sell
us down the river.''
   The results will not be made public until after the votes from
the Jay mill are counted along with those cast by idled workers in
DePere, Wis.; Lockhaven, Pa.; and Mobile, Ala., union leaders said.
   The latest proposal came during national negotiations in
Louisville, Ky., that began late last month. The details have not
been made public.
   More than 1,200 workers in Jay walked off the job June 16 in a
dispute over management demands for concessions involving premium
pay and work rules. Since then, IP has continued to run the mill
with what it describes as permanent replacement workers.

Republic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor
of New York baptized a relative of President Joaquin Balaguer
during a stopover here before starting a four-day visit to Cuba.
   The Roman Catholic prelate arrived on Sunday afternoon and was
scheduled to depart today for Santiago de Cuba, where he will
celebrate a Mass before traveling to Havana for meetings with
church leaders.
   The Cuba visit comes at a time when leader Fidel Castro has
eased restrictions on religious activity. O'Connor will be the
highest ranking U.S. Catholic official to visit Cuba since Castro
came to power in 1959. He may visit Castro, but no meeting has been
confirmed.
   The official purpose of his trip is to honor the 200th birthday
of the Rev. Felix Varela, a Cuban priest who spent many years in
New York.
   ``This is a dream realized. It means everything to me,'' said
Marilyn Balaguer de Torterolo, a niece of the president, whose
7-month-old son Marcos was baptized.
   ``We became very good friends in New York. He (O'Connor) married
me and baptized my other son,'' she said. ``My sister had cancer
and before he was a bishop or cardinal, he visited her every day.''
   Before leaving today, O'Connor was to attend a ground-breaking
ceremony for a children's hospital in Santo Domingo. The funding
came from the Foundation for Catholic Health Care in the Dominican
Republic, a group O'Connor helped set up on a visit in 1987.
   The hospital will have 300 beds and cost $15 million, said
Richard Yezzo, a foundation official and president of St. Clare's
Hospital in New York.
   The cardinal has traveled in the Dominican Republic twice in the
past three years, his interest caused in part by the 850,000
Hispanics in his diocese of 1.8 million Catholics.
   Before departing by private jet for Cuba, O'Connor also was to
address a conference on AIDS that the foundation helped sponsor.

   U.S. warships today attacked two offshore
Iranian oil facilities in the Persian Gulf in retaliation for a
mine explosion that ripped open the hull of an American frigate and
injured 10 crewmen.
   Iran countered by striking oil facilities off Sharjah and at
least two U.S. vessels.
   The White House said three U.S. warships ships attacked each
Iranian platform and that the facilities were on fire. No American
casualties were reported in the U.S. attacks, and the Iranians
reportedly fled prior to the shelling.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the U.S. warships
first struck the Sassan platform in the southern gulf at 9 a.m.
(1:30 a.m. EDT). Twenty-three minutes later they blasted the Nasr
platform at nearby Sirri Island, IRNA said.
   Soon afterward, an Iranian warship shelled oil facilities off
Sharjah, an emirate in the southern gulf, shipping executives said.
   Targeted in the Iranian attack were the Scanbay drilling rig,
the 112,744-ton British tanker York Marine and a storage facility.
All three are in the Mubarak oilfield off Sharjah, the gulf-based
executives said.
   The executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
York Marine was set afire and that its crew had abandoned the
vessel.
   A Reagan administration official in Washington said an Iranian
guided missile patrol boat had fired on the U.S. cruiser
Wainwright, one of the American ships that took part in the attack
on one of the Iranian platforms.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Wainwright was not hit. He said the U.S. frigate Simpson returned
fire and scored a direct hit on the patrol boat. Asked if the
Iranian ship was sunk, he said only, ``It scored a direct hit; use
your imagination.''
   The official also said a U.S. supply vessel, the Willy Tide, was
under attack by three Iranian speedboats. He said he had no other
details.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit also
reported the attack on the Willy Tide, a 283-ton vessel operated by
Tidewater Inc. of New Orleans.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since 1980, and the war has
produced repeated attacks on neutral shipping. Last July, the
United States stepped up its presence in the gulf, reflagging 11
Kuwaiti tankers and giving them U.S. Navy escorts.
   The U.S. raid on the Iranian oil platforms was confirmed by the
White House early today after it was reported by Iran and the
shipping executives. The White House said the attack was ``a
measured response to Iran's unlawful use of force.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there were no U.S. casualties in
the raid and the United States did not know of any on the Iranian
side.
   ``These actions,'' he said, ``were taken in response to Iran's
recent resumption of mine laying in international waters and its
mine attack (Thursday) on the USS (frigate) Samuel B. Roberts ...
The government of Iran has repeatedly been warned about the
consequences of such hostile acts.''
   Fitzwater said he did not know how many people were aboard the
platforms, although they normally have a complement of 20 to 40
men. They are manned by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. He said they
were given several minutes warning, and some were seen leaving.
   The White House spokesman said the frigates Simpson and Bagley
and the cruiser Wainwright attacked the Sirri platform. He said the
platform is 18 miles off Sirri Island. Iran's statement, monitored
in Cyprus, said the platform was on the island. The two reports
could not be reconciled immediately.
   Fitzwater said the destroyers Merril and McCormick and the
landing platform ship Trenton, which carries helicopters, attacked
the Sassan platform.
   He said there was no indication of Iranian resistance and that
both platforms were burning about three hours after the attacks.
   The shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said their monitors picked up a radio message about 30 minutes
before the attack in which a U.S. warship urged platform workers to
evacuate.
   The executives said the warning specified the facilities ``will
be shelled in five minutes.''
   The Iranians radioed back: ``We have no instructions to leave
the place.''
   Eight minutes later, the American warship, which the executives
could not identify, said: ``We will blast the platform in half a
second.''
   One shipping executive noted: ``Circumstances of the attack on
Sassan were very much similar to those that preceded the U.S.
shelling of Rostam last October.'' Rostam is the sister platform to
Sassan.
   The Rostam was wrecked in October 1987 after Iran fired a
Chinese Silkworm missile into a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil tanker,
injuring 18 crewmen. ``After a five-minute warning, the American
guns blazed away at the platform,'' the executive said of the
attack on Rostam.
   The Samuel B. Roberts had sailed into a mine field on Thursday
and was trying to manuever to safety when it was hit by a submerged
mine, U.S. military officials said on Sunday.
   While trying to move ``at minimum speed to maintain a safe
distance'' from three mines it had spotted on the surface, the
3,700-ton warship ``apparently slid into the mine from the side,''
said Maj. Barry Willey of the U.S. Central Command.
   The explosion blew a hole in the port side of the ship's hull
beneath the waterline, causing fire and flooding and injuring the
10 crewmen.
   The frigate to the United Arab Emirates port of Dubai on
Saturday. The four most seriously injured Americans have been flown
to a U.S. military hospital in West Germany.
   U.S. officals also said on Sunday that two more mines had been
found and destroyed in the waters where the Roberts was crippled.
That brought to five the number known to have been seen in the area.
   U.S. officials have said the mines were recently laid and that
they came from the same source as those found on an Iranian
minelayer disabled by U.S. helicopters on Sept. 21, 1987.

   Cpl. Ricardo Villahermosa, killed
accidentally by fellow Marines in Panama last week, had said before
he left for that Central American nation that he ``wasn't coming
back,'' friends said at his funeral.
   The corporal, who was eulogized as a peacemaker for his efforts
on behalf of his country, was saluted with a three-gun volley and
taps during the services Sunday.
   The Rev. John Flood, minister of Whitakers Baptist Church and
the grandfather of Villahermosa's wife, Titina, said the
25-year-old Marine was part of a ``God-ordained force to protect.
``Without that protection, we are loose for the enemy to destroy.''
   After the service, friends of the Camp Lejeune Marine said he
was ``fun to be with'' but that he ``didn't seem right'' and had
said that he didn't expect to come back.
   Villahermosa, a weapons platoon squad leader, was part of a
12-man security patrol guarding a petroleum storage area near a
U.S. military base. He was shot in the abdomen last Tuesday by
fellow Marines who thought they were firing at intruders.
   Villahermosa's 3-year-old daughter Victoria sat on her mother's
lap throughout the memorial service, playing with a strand of beads
around her mother's neck.
   Villahermosa's family flew to North Carolina from Puerto Rico
and California for the service at Johnson Funeral Home in Rocky
Mount. Villahermosa was buried at a family cemetery near Sharpsburg.
   A Marine handed the corporal's folded flag to Victoria. A second
flag went to Villahermosa's father, Augustine, of Puerto Rico, who
flew to North Carolina for the service.
   Villahermosa's brother, Hendrick, of California, was also at the
service. Villahermosa's mother, Juanita, was ill and could not make
the trip from Puerto Rico, friends said.
   After the service, friends of the family remembered Rick as a
happy, friendly man.
   ``He was fun to be with. If you were down, you could go to
him,'' said Diane Lamm of New Bern. ``If you didn't have a brother,
you had one in him. He most surely died a hero.''
   Cynthia Marker, who was a neighbor of Villahermosa at a mobile
home park in Bridgeton, said she saw Villahermosa the night before
he reported to Camp Lejeune. ``He just didn't seem right. He told
me he wasn't coming back. I thought he was kidding,'' she said.
   Flood said he received a similar impression from talking to
family members.
   ``I don't think he was looking to come back,'' Flood said.

   Mary Vincent says she once considered suicide
after a rapist hacked her forearms off during nine years ago, but
now a young son has given her a reason to live.
   ``There are times when it takes an hour or two to get myself
together in the morning because I get so frustrated that I cannot
stop crying,'' she said in an interview published in this week's
issue of People magazine.
   Ms. Vincent says she still has nightmares about the attack and
struggles to cope without hands.
   Larry Singleton was convicted in 1978 of raping Ms. Vincent,
chopping off her forearms with an ax and leaving her for dead. She
walked three miles and was rescued by motorists.
   Singleton is scheduled to be released from parole on April 25;
because of controversy over his release he has been living on the
grounds of San Quentin Prison near San Francisco.
   Ms. Vincent says she dreads his release out of concern for her
18-month-old son, Luke.
   ``I don't want anything to happen to him,'' she said. ``I
treasure him like life itself. He is my life.''
   Ms. Vincent, 24, outfitted with prostheses with metal pincers,
lives as a single mother on welfare in a small town in the
northwestern United States which People did not to identify.
   As for men, she said, ``I don't think too highly of them any
more. Luke's father, he understood me, and I basically understood
him, but he is like (other) people who want to care about somebody
who went through a bad trauma: They can't cope with the hurt that
goes on inside me or any other victim.''

<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Jim McCrery said he expects to
take the oath of office this week to become northwest Louisiana's
first GOP congressman in 114 years, although his opponent has
refused to concede.
   McCrery's thin margin in a special election Saturday over
Democrat Foster Campbell prompted Gov. Buddy Roemer to send state
police and private security personnel to beef up security around
locked voting machines.
   The victory won't be official until Tuesday, when the machines
are opened and the results verified. Complete but unofficial
returns show McCrery with 51 percent or 63,488 votes to 49 percent
or 62,139 votes for Campbell, a state senator.
   If it holds, the victory will even out Louisiana's house
delegation at four Democrats and four Republicans. McCrery will
replace Roemer, a Democrat who vacated the 4th District seat when
he took office as governor March 14.
   McCrery touted himself as a follower of the popular Democratic
governor's conservative principles. He said he will win again when
he is up for re-election to a full term in the fall.
   ``I think this shows that the people here are going to elect me
and re-elect me,'' McCrery, 38, said Sunday. ``I represent the
philosophy of this area'a main stream.''
   His Democratic opponent tried to paint McCrery as a tool of
special interests, noting that McCrery's last job was as a lobbyist.
   Prior to his stint as a lobbyist for Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
McCrery, a former Democrat, was a congressional aide, first serving
Congressman Buddy Leach, then Roemer after Roemer defeated Leach in
a 1980 election.
   Campbell, 41, didn't talk with reporters Sunday. His manager,
Joe Ticheli said Campbell wasn't ready to concede.
   There was confusion about the exact vote in Caddo Parish forcing
officials to check and recheck totals.
   On election night, Secretary of State Fox McKeithen raised
questions about the removal of about 3,000 voters from the Caddo
Parish rolls of registered voters between the March 8 primary
election and Saturday's runoff. McCrery ran well in Caddo Parish.
   McKeithen said on Sunday that the purge broke no state laws, but
he was planning to check that with federal officials.
   McCrery led the March 8 primary with 31 percent of the vote to
Campbell's 19 percent in a field of 10 candidates. Louisiana's open
primary system puts the top two vote-getters in a runoff,
regardless of party affiliation, if no candidate has a clear
majority.

disaster in a letter to his sister, Hattie, in New York City.
   The quake ``was not only shaking and swinging the house to and
fro, but the whole structure was jumping and bouncing up and
down,'' he wrote. Outside, ``multitudes of men, women and children
in their nightclothes'' filled the streets.
   At about 6:30 a.m., he went from his home near the Fairmont
Hotel to the restaurant he owned in Chinatown ``to learn the fate
of our night cooks.''
   ``I found the building partly fallen'' and there were ``dead
right in front of our place, partly covered with bricks,'' he wrote.
   Hagopian ``saw the Chinese running from across and then back,
and caught in between two falling walls _ getting killed
instantly.''
   The letter said the ``whole waterfront was in flames and smoke.''
   ``In the debris were horses dead by the dozens, and gents' hats
scattered here and there gave evidence of the men killed.''
   The fire ``had things all in its favor. No water to fight it and
the wind to help to spread its destruction.''
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale. The quake and fire that followed were blamed for an
estimated 700 deaths.
   Evelyn Hagopian, who now lives in Berkeley, said that in
addition to the letter she also has a rocking chair with a burned
arm that her mother used as a sled to haul away some clothes from
the wreckage of their home.
   ``I was so tiny I don't remember much of anything about the
earthquake,'' she said. ``But I hate those flaming lights from
highway flares. I think that's the only way the 1906 earthquake and
fire affected me.''

<HEAD>Remains Of 60-Foot Sea Lizard Located In Lowndes County</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAGGS, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists plan to reassemble a 60-foot-long
``lord of the sea'' that is believed to be about 20 feet longer
than the discovered remains of other sea lizards.
   Robert T. Bakker, University of Colorado Museum Curator, said
fossilized mosasaurs have been found in other parts of the world.
But he said ``the largest we know of were in the 40-foot-long
range.''
   ``It was the lord of the sea and there is nothing like it
today,'' Bakker said of the creature.
   He said the Lowndes County site, more than 100 miles from the
Gulf of Mexico, was about 100 feet under water when mosasaurs ruled
the depths.
   ``Mosasaurs became extinct along with dinosaurs at the end of
the Mesozoic era,'' about 70 million years before the appearance of
humans, said Doug Jones, director of the University of Alabama
Museum of Natural History.
   Bakker and Jones visited Saturday at the site of the dig, which
started about one month ago.
   The scientists said the lizard had a six-foot-long head and a
two-hinged jaw capable of swallowing a cow.
   ``If a tyrannosaurus rex ever ventured into the water around
where one of those was, it would have more than had its hands
full,'' Bakker said as he scraped clay from part of the jawbone.
   ``It could swallow a Hereford steer whole and probably could go
through a herd one at a time _ it was that large,'' Bakker said.
   The discovery was made by Jones and Jerry Oldshue, the assistant
vice president for student affairs at Alabama. University officials
said they hope to take the fossilized remains to Tuscaloosa to be
reassembled.
   Oyster shells and other evidence of sea life was found by the
paleontologists Saturday, including some that had become fossilized
on parts of the uncovered mosasaur.
   Jones said it would be ``many weeks'' before the dig is complete.
   ``We want to make sure we can preserve what we have here,'' he
said.

   A prosecutor-turned-novelist
becomes the mayor of this celebrity mecca Tuesday amid concern that
his abrasive, anti-establishment style will intensify the City
Council's infighting.
   Robert Tanenbaum, 45, who maintains a law practice, devotes most
of his time away from City Hall to his relatively new occupation _
writing. His first endeavor, the autobiographical ``Badge Of The
Assassin,'' which traced his pursuit of police killers, was made
into a 1985 CBS-TV movie.
   With two successful careers under his belt, why does Tanenbaum
sacrifice 20 or so hours a week to the city of Beverly Hills?
   ``He's the most honest guy I know and why he got involved in
politics _ well, that I'll never know,'' said longtime friend and
assistant Don Baezler.
   But while no one questions Tanenbaum's honesty, his method of
governing has caused a stir among the city's establishment, to
which the transplanted New Yorker definitely does not belong.
   Tanenbaum was the top vote-getter in the 1986 election _ his
first run for a council seat _ and he has kept his campaign pledge
to vote consistently against overdevelopment and commercial
encroachment on residential areas of this wealthy Los Angeles-area
community.
   But his courtroom-style cross-examinations, shouting matches and
name-calling during council meetings have raised the ire of many.
   In addition, some find it odd that Baezler, a former detective
with the New York Police Department, lives in Tanenbaum's home and
works alongside him.
   ``I'd be talking to someone at a council meeting and he
(Tanenbaum) would send over his bodyguard, or whatever (Baezler)
is, to listen to what I'm saying,'' said Ed Brown, a former mayor
and real estate investment executive. ``It's a type of
intimidation.''
   But Tanenbaum, who as the former deputy chief of homicide for
the New York District Attorney's Office helped ``put away my share
of mobsters,'' said Baezler is no political spy, merely his
assistant and trusted family friend.
   ``I don't need a bodyguard,'' said the 6-foot-6 former college
basketball player, who also lives with his wife and three children.
``(But) because of the cases I've dealt with in the past, I've been
threatened many times. I'm tough-skinned, but it's comforting to
know Don is here with my family when I have to be away.''
   The mayorship is rotated annually among the five council
members, who serve four-year terms and are paid $330 a month.
   Calling himself a representative of the ``regular Joes,''
Tanenbaum says he ran for office after detecting what he claimed
was a distortion of values among city officials.
   ``The notion here was interest groups and wealthy people get
their candidates in office in order to get what they want done,''
Tanenbaum said. ``After attending a few council meetings, I saw
that developers were treated with sensitivity while residents were
treated like alien creatures.''
   Despite its small size _ some 30,000 residents, who have an
average income of about $40,000 _ Beverly Hills is starting to
share the problems suffered by cities many times its size: traffic,
a high robbery rate and overzealous developers.
   ``We're a schizophrenic city,'' said Councilwoman Donna Ellman.
``At night we are small but during the day we grow up to 200,000
people and we are called upon to provide basic services for all.
   ``It's the businesses that pay for a lot of those services, and
it's a hard balance to maintain a healthy business community yet
retain a small-town residential atmosphere.''
   Retaining a healthy atmosphere in the council also has been
difficult.
   Benjamin Stansbury, who is being replaced as mayor by Tanenbaum,
once called him a ``turkey'' and Councilman Maxwell Salter labeled
him a ``demagogue.'' Relations reached their lowest point last fall
when Tanenbaum called Salter an ``intellectual cretin'' during a
session televised on a cable channel.
   ``I think what he has shown is disrespect for his staff, fellow
council and the public,'' said Brown.
   Tanenbaum says he is more soft-spoken than he was two years ago,
and vows as mayor to get rid of the ``Hatfield-McCoy mentality''
that has permeated the council.

   The accounts of widespread Iranian resistance stood in sharp
contrast to last fall's similar attack on Iranian offshore
platforms. During that operation, Iranians heeded warnings to
abandon the platforms and did not confront U.S. warships directly.
   Carlucci, while stressing he had few details, acknowledged this
morning the Pentagon was still receiving reports of Iranian
military action around the Persian Gulf.
   ``There has been a British ship that was fired upon,'' he said.
``There are reports of some other attacks in oil fields off Abu
Dhabi, but we've not fully confirmed those reports yet.''
   It also appears a commercial American supply boat, the Willy
Tide, may have come under attack, Carlucci said.
   ``Whether there is further (U.S. military) action depends upon
the Iranians,'' the defense secretary said.
   ``We hope they will draw their lesson from this. But if they do
continue to attack, we will take appropriate action.''

<TEXT>
   Republican Jim McCrery said he expects to
take the oath of office this week to become northwest Louisiana's
first GOP congressman in 114 years, although his opponent has
refused to concede.
   McCrery's thin margin in a special election Saturday over
Democrat Foster Campbell prompted Gov. Buddy Roemer to send state
police and private security personnel to beef up security around
locked voting machines.
   The victory won't be official until Tuesday, when the machines
are opened and the results verified. Complete but unofficial
returns show McCrery with 51 percent or 63,488 votes to 49 percent
or 62,139 votes for Campbell, a state senator.
   If it holds, the victory will even out Louisiana's house
delegation at four Democrats and four Republicans. McCrery will
replace Roemer, a Democrat who vacated the 4th District seat when
he took office as governor March 14.
   McCrery touted himself as a follower of the popular Democratic
governor's conservative principles. He said he will win again when
he is up for re-election to a full term in the fall.
   ``I think this shows that the people here are going to elect me
and re-elect me,'' McCrery, 38, said Sunday. ``I represent the
philosophy of this area'a main stream.''
   His Democratic opponent tried to paint McCrery as a tool of
special interests, noting that McCrery's last job was as a lobbyist.
   Prior to his stint as a lobbyist for Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
McCrery, a former Democrat, was a congressional aide, first serving
Congressman Buddy Leach, then Roemer after Roemer defeated Leach in
a 1980 election.
   Campbell, 41, didn't talk with reporters Sunday. His manager,
Joe Ticheli said Campbell wasn't ready to concede.
   There was confusion about the exact vote in Caddo Parish forcing
officials to check and recheck totals.
   On election night, Secretary of State Fox McKeithen raised
questions about the removal of about 3,000 voters from the Caddo
Parish rolls of registered voters between the March 8 primary
election and Saturday's runoff. McCrery ran well in Caddo Parish.
   McKeithen said on Sunday that the purge broke no state laws, but
he was planning to check that with federal officials.
   McCrery led the March 8 primary with 31 percent of the vote to
Campbell's 19 percent in a field of 10 candidates. Louisiana's open
primary system puts the top two vote-getters in a runoff,
regardless of party affiliation, if no candidate has a clear
majority.

   Olson became ill with the flu on March 18 and had surgery seven

chemotherapy as an outpatient since that time.
   ``All of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of

<TEXT>
   Bombs exploded early today at the
Jewish Community Center and the Saudi Arabian airlines office,
damaging both buildings but causing no injuries. Police said both
devices were probably planted by the same attackers.
   Police said Monday that bombs, one that blew a large hole in
front of the Frankfurt Jewish Community Center and another that
shattered the plate-glass windows of the Saudi Arabian airlines
office, were probably planted by the same attackers.
   The bombs, which went off shortly after midnight only a few
minutes and about a mile apart, blew a large hole in front of the
Jewish center and shattered the windows of the Saudi office. The
blast near the Saudi office also damaged the adjacent offices of
Air Canada.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks.
   Frankfurt prosecutor spokesman Jochen Schroers said both
bombings ``apparently were carried out by the same group because
evidence at both sites is similar.''
   Schroers said by telephone that police think ``industrial or
military explosives'' were used in the bombings.
   ``There was neither insulation material nor a fire extinguisher
or anything similar,'' for packing homemade explosives into, he
said. Fire extinguishers containing traces of explosives often have
been found after bombings in West Germany.
   Damage at the Jewish Community Center was estimated at tens of
thousands of dollars, and about $300,000 at the Saudi Arabian
airlines office, Schroers said.
   The head of West Germany's Jewish Communities, Heinz Galinski,
issued a statement today in West Berlin calling on authorities to
tighten security near Jewish property to prevent such attacks.
   ``It is not understandable for me that even today _ especially
in view of the increasing number of threatening and abusive letters
_ that Jewish communities have difficulty when they try to get
sufficient security for their property,'' Galinski said.
   The first bomb went off at the Jewish Community Center in the
residential West Side just after midnight. At 12:18 a.m. (6:18 p.m.
EDT Sunday), the second bomb exploded at the office of Saudia
Airlines, police said.
   The Jewish Community Center, a modern, marble-fronted building
which houses conference rooms, a gymnasium, restaurant and other
facilities, was opened in September 1986.
   A Volkswagen bus parked in front of the Jewish Community Center
was destroyed, police said. Police said a caretaker was inside the
center at the time of the blast but was not injured.
   No one was inside the airline office when the explosion occurred
there, police said.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Key Regulation on Natural Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a key
federal regulation designed to foster competition within the
natural gas industry.
   The justices, without comment, rejected appeals by pipeline
companies that claim the rule places them in an unfair economic
bind.
   The justices also refused to hear arguments by natural gas
producers who support giving federal officials broader power to
regulate the pipelines.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adopted sweeping new
regulations in 1985 to change the way the natural gas industry
operates.
   The key change _ called the open-access rule _ is aimed at
giving consumers the benefits of competition among natural gas
suppliers.
   The rule requires pipeline companies, under certain conditions,
to transport gas sold by other producers and traders. Thus, the
pipeline companies would carry gas that is in competition with
their own supplies.
   The commission adopted the rule to end what it said was a
practice that unnecessarily inflates the price of some gas supplies.
   Potentially billions of dollars in proceeds from gas sales are
at stake in the dispute.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here substantially upheld the
commission's new regulations last year, stating that the pipeline
companies apparently were trying to stifle competition.
   ``Their attack on the (commission rule) is precisely that it may
disable them from passing on to customers gas purchase costs that
they incur under contracts entered into years ago under premises
now obsolete,'' the appeals court said. ``In other words,
enforcement (of the rule) will expose them to competition that
their discriminatory practices enable them to avoid.''
   The commission said the pipelines had been practicing unfair
discrimination by generally declining to transport gas in
competition with their own sales, thus denying consumers access to
gas at the lowest reasonable rates.
   The commission said the problem was aggravated by the phasing
out of price controls in recent years.
   In the appeal acted on today, the pipeline companies said the
open-access rule is causing a dramatic decline in gas sales and a
drop in drilling for gas reserves. The regulation ``has raised
questions as to the security of the nation's gas supply and has
threatened the financial and operational base of the pipeline
industry,'' the companies said.
   The appeals court here stopped short of upholding all of the
commission's 1985 regulations.
   The appeals court ordered the commission to come up with an
adequate explanation of its decision not to amend so-called
take-or-pay provisions in gas supply contracts.
   A take-or-pay provision requires a pipeline to pay a producer
for some specified percentage of deliverable gas, for example 75
percent, even if the pipeline took less.
   The pipeline companies say such provisions became particularly
onerous by committing them to high gas costs in what by 1982 became
a time of falling prices.
   Natural gas producers urged the justices to overturn that
portion of the appeals court ruling that requires the commission to
re-examine its support of the take-or-pay concept.
   The cases are Interstate Natural Gas Association vs. FERC,
87-976; Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. vs. FERC, 87-977; Shell
Offshore Inc. vs. Associated Gas Distributors, 87-978; Willcox,
Ariz., vs. FERC, 87-979; and Southern California Gas Co. vs. FERC,
87-1091.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up New Mexico Tax Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
limiting the power of states and Indian tribes to impose duplicate
taxes on oil and gas taken from Indian lands.
   The court said it will hear a petroleum company's challenge to
taxes imposed by New Mexico officials.
   Cotton Petroleum Corp. and its affiliate, United Crude Co.,
challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 15,000 acres of the
Jicarilla Apache reservation in New Mexico.
   The corporation pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6
percent of its production. In addition, New Mexico levies five
taxes amounting to about 8 percent of the corporation's
on-reservation production.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged the two biggest state taxes on the
grounds they illegally overlap the taxes imposed by the tribe. The
corporation said oil and gas producers in the state with deposits
on non-Indian land are taxed only 8 percent of their production.
   The corporation said the dual taxation interferes unlawfully
with interstate commerce. It also argued that the state taxes are
excessive because the corporation receives limited services from
the state.
   For example, Cotton Petroleum said that from 1981 through 1985
it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico but received only
$89,000 in services from the state.
   The New Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the state taxes last
September.
   ``There is no requirement that benefits conferred must equal
taxes extracted,'' the appeals court said, adding that the levies
do not interfere improperly with interstate commerce.
   New Mexico officials said the dispute is a matter of great
concern in western states.
   They said there are more than 150 cases in which companies with
oil and gas deposits on Indian land are protesting such double
taxation in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Utah.
   The case is Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico, 87-1327.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Political Party Issue in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may bar political party leaders from endorsing
primary election candidates and whether states may regulate
political party structure.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating parts of a
California law overturned as infringements on citizens' rights to
express themselves and associate with whom they please.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October threw out key
portions of the California election law.
   That decision marked the second time in less than two years that
the appeals court said the state had interfered unconstitutionally
with political parties. The Supreme Court last year ordered the
appeals court to reconsider its initial ruling in light of a 1986
Supreme Court decision on political parties.
   The justices had ruled in 1986 in a case from Connecticut that
states with open primaries may not bar independent voters from
casting ballots to determine party nominees.
   The 9th Circuit court said the 1986 ruling supported its
decision to strike down portions of the California law.
   ``Prohibiting the governing body of a political party from
supporting some candidates and opposing others (in primary
elections) patently infringes both the right of the party to
express itself freely and the right of party members to an
unrestricted flow of political information,'' the appeals court
said.
   ``California's ban on pre-primary endorsements is a form of
paternalism that is inconsistent with the First Amendment,'' it
said.
   The appeals court also struck down rules that dictated the
make-up of state party central committtees and set terms of office
for party chairmen.
   State officials said the ban on primary endorsements was
designed to prevent factionalism within parties and to prevent
voters from being unduly influenced by party leaders.
   California revamped its elections laws around the turn of the
century to break the grip on political parties by wealthy special
interests, particularly the Southern Pacific Railroad Co.
   But the 9th Circuit court said such rules as prohibiting party
leaders from endorsing candidates in primaries now have the effect
of undermining the parties' main goals.
   ``The state has effectively drained party central committees of
political power,'' the appeals court said.
   The state law was challenged by county Democratic and Republican
leaders and by state leaders of the Libertarian Party.
   The case is March Fong Eu vs. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Committee, 87-1269.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings, who says he unlawfully is being
subjected to possible impeachment.
   The court, without comment, left intact a 1980 law under which
fellow judges asked the House of Representatives to consider
impeaching Hastings for alleged judicial misconduct.
   The justices also refused to block the release of confidential
grand jury documents concerning Hastings to the House Judiciary
Committee.
   Hastings, who lives and works in Miami, contends the 1980 law is
unconstitutional.
   A federal trial jury acquitted Hastings of a bribery charge in
1983 after his friend, Washington lawyer William Borders, was
convicted in a separate trial of soliciting a $150,000 bribe in
return for promised official favors from Hastings.
   Soon after Hastings' acquittal, two federal judges in the 11th
U.S. Circuit, which encompasses Florida, Georgia and Alabama, filed
a complaint charging that he had obstructed justice and lied under
oath during his prosecution.
   An investigative panel of 11th Circuit judges compiled a
381-page report that recommended Hastings be impeached. Acting on
that recommendation, the U.S. Judicial Conference in 1987 asked the
House to consider impeachment.
   The conference, a 27-judge board of directors for the federal
courts headed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, said Hastings
``has engaged in conduct which might constitute grounds for
impeachment.''
   But the conference made no move to suspend Hastings from
continuing to preside over trials or carrying out his other
judicial duties.
   The House has not yet determined whether to impeach Hastings,
who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. If it did, he
would stand trial in the Senate.
   The judges who filed the complaint against Hastings did so under
the provisions of the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct
Disability Act of 1980.
   Under the law, any person may file a complaint alleging that a
federal judge or magistrate ``has engaged in conduct prejudicial to
the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the
courts'' or ``is unable to discharge all the duties of office by
reason of mental or physical disability.''
   The chief judge of a judicial circuit has the authority to
dismiss the complaint as frivolous or empanel an investigative
committee of judges.
   If that committee believes impeachment may be warranted, the
1980 law requires it to certify that determination with the
Judicial Conference, which in turn may conduct its own
investigation and send the matter to the House.
   Hastings contends that the law unconstitutionally allows judges
to usurp congressional power by taking impeachment matters before
the House.
   Hastings, the only black federal trial judge in Florida, has
suggested that the allegations against him could be racially
inspired.
   He also has said he may be the victim of a vendetta by Justice
Department officials angered by his rulings that blocked
deportations of Haitian refugees.
   Rehnquist disqualified himself from acting on the emergency
request and the formal appeal from Hastings.
   The cases are Hastings vs. U.S. Judicial Conference, 87-1187,
and Hastings vs. House Judiciary Committee, A-788.

<HEAD>Court Says Texas Blood Bank Must Reveal Donors' Names</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let a
Dallas blood bank withhold the names and medical records of its
donors from a woman who says her husband contracted AIDS after
receiving tranfusions.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that donors'
privacy rights do not override Patty Jo Baker's need to learn their
identities for her wrongful-death lawsuit.
   Although today's action sets no national precedent, the justices
twice in two months have rejected arguments that ``the national
interests in a viable volunteer blood system'' are jeopardized by
releasing donors' names in such circumstances.
   George W. Baker underwent surgery at Lewisville Memorial
Hospital in Dallas in 1984, and received several transfusions
during and after the operation. He died in 1986 of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome.
   His widow, charging that at least one of the transfused blood
units was contaminated with the AIDS virus, sued the hosital, the
operating surgeon and two blood banks that supply the hospital.
   As part of the pretrial ``discovery'' proceedings, Mrs. Baker's
lawyers sought the identities and medical records of all blood
donors whose blood had been used in Baker's health care.
   The defendants objected, arguing that complying with the
requests would violate donors' privacy rights and that such
information was protected under the physician-patient privilege.
   A trial judge ruled that the requested information must be
released, and a state appeals court agreed. The Texas Supreme Court
refused to hear the case.
   The appeal acted on today was filed by one of the sued blood
banks, known as the Blood Center at Wadley. It is based in Dallas.
   Lawyers for the blood bank said courts in Florida and Iowa have
barred the release of blood donors' names in similar cases.
   ``The blood banks are a nationwide operation,'' the appeal said.
``A blood donor's freedom from intrusive questioning and disclosure
of the most intimate details of his life should not depend upon
which state the donor chooses as his place of residence or where
his blood is sent.''
   The appeal said the Texas courts ``gave too litle weight to the
privacy of donors and the interest of the public in a volunteer
blood system.''
   The case is Wadley Research Institute and Blood Bank vs.
Houston, 87-1438.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Government Approve Use of Some Color
Additives</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today refused to let the
government approve the use in cosmetics of color additives that
pose a minimal risk of causing cancer.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the cosmetics
industry that safe substances are being forced off the market.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last October that
federal law prohibits the Food and Drug Administration from
approving two additives, orange dye number 17 and red dye number
19, even though the cancer risks are ``trivial.''
   Government researchers, citing tests with laboratory animals,
said the lifetime use of a product with orange dye number 17 poses
a cancer risk of one in 19 billion, and for red dye number 19 one
in nine million.
   The FDA said the threat from each was ``so trivial as to be
effectively no risk.''
   The dyes are used in lipsticks, face powders, rouges and
products for hair and nails.
   The appeals court compared use of the dyes to the greater risk
of cosmic radiation posed by living in Denver or of toxins
contained in peanuts.
   ``Those who indulge in (those activities) can hardly be thought
of as living dangerously,'' the appeals court said.
   But it gave a strict interpretation to a 1960 federal law that
prohibits FDA approval for any color additive ``found ... to induce
cancer in man or animal.''
   The appeals court said it decided ``with some reluctance'' that
the law does not allow exceptions for minimally risky products.
   The FDA's approval of the color additives was challenged by
Public Citizen, a consumer group. It said banning the dyes is
sensible because of uncertainty about whether there are safe levels
for carcinogens ``and the lack of benefits of color additives.''
   The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, representing
the cosmetics industry, asked the Supreme Court to permit FDA
approval.
   Reagan administration lawyers said they disagree with the
appeals court ruling but said the case does not warrant the high
court's review.
   The case is Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association vs.
Public Citizen, 87-1194.

<HEAD>Court Affirms Ruling in Washington State Union Dues Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that a worker may not be fired for refusing on religious grounds to
pay union dues.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a machinists
union in Seattle, Wash., seeking to force a Boeing Co. employee to
pay union dues.
   Thomasine Nichols said her personal religious beliefs bar her
from paying dues to Lodge 751 of the International Association of
Machinists & Aerospace Workers.
   Mrs. Nichols said she believes the Bible teaches that labor
organizations should be abolished. Her view is not shared by the
religious group to which she belongs, the Bethel Temple.
   She offered to contribute a sum equal to her assessed union dues
to a charity.
   Boeing refused to fire her, even though her refusal to pay dues
violated the company's contract with the machinists union.
   The union sued in federal court in 1986. It said Mrs. Nichols
should not be exempt from paying dues because she is not a member
of a religious organization that traditionally opposes union
membership.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last November that
Mrs. Nichols is protected against being fired by the federal Civil
Rights Act of 1972, which requires employers to make reasonable
accommodations for workers' religious beliefs.
   The law requires such accommodations unless they pose ``undue
hardships'' to the employer.
   The appeals court said granting a dues exemption to Mrs. Nichols
does not impose undue hardship on the union.
   ``To prove undue hardship, a union must demonstrate a widespread
refusal to pay union dues,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also rejected the union's claims that a 1985
Supreme Court ruling requires Mrs. Nichols pay the dues.
   The justices in 1985 struck down a Connecticut law that gave
workers a right to designate their own Sabbath as a day off from
work.
   The 9th Circuit court said the 1985 ruling declared the
Connecticut law unconstitutional because of its ``complete failure
to take into account the interests of the employer and other
employees who did not observe a Sabbath.''
   The 1972 civil rights law ``does not give an unqualified right
to employees to have their religious beliefs accommodated,'' the
appeals court said.
   Therefore the federal law adheres to the Constitution's required
separation of church and state, the appeals court said.
   The union's argument that the National Labor Relations Act of
1980 takes precedence over the 1972 law also was rejected by the
appeals court.
   The 1980 law says no worker may be forced to pay union dues if
that violates ``established and traditional tenets or teachings of
a bona fide religion, body or sect.''
   The 9th Circuit court said that rights created by the 1972 law
``are independent and separate from the rights created by the
National Labor Relations Act.''
   Mrs. Nichols was aided in the case by the National Right to Work
Legal Defense Foundation in Springfield, Va.
   The case is International Association of Machinists vs. Boeing,
87-1484.

<HEAD>Court Will Try to Clarify Civil Rights Issue in Michigan Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will try to
clarify the issue of when a federal civil rights law may be used to
sue states and their agencies.
   The court agreed to consider a lawsuit that accuses Michigan
officials of denying a promotion to a state employee because his
brother was a political activist.
   The justices will review a ruling that threw out a suit against
the state police and its director.
   Ray Will sought promotion to a job as data systems analyst with
the state police in 1973. He had been ranked second on a promotion
list, and moved up to number one when the applicant above him
withdrew from consideration.
   But Will said he learned years later that he didn't get the job
because a so-called Red Squad operated by the state police had
investigated his brother, Charles, a student political activist.
   The Red Squad, which monitored campus radicals with subversive
ideas, was held unconstitutional by a state judge in 1976.
   Will then sued his employers in state court under a federal
civil rights law enacted after the Civil War. The suit named the
state police and its director as defendants.
   A state judge in 1982 ruled that Will's rights were violated and
awarded him more than $153,000 for lost wages, emotional distress
and punitive damages.
   But the Michigan Supreme Court overruled the judge last August.
   The state's highest court said the civil rights law invoked by
Will authorizes suits against ``persons,'' and that neither the
state, the state police nor the police director may be
characterized as a person for purposes of seeking back pay and
monetary damages.
   Neither a state nor ``a state official sued in an official
capacity for retroactive relief'' is a person under the law, the
state court said.
   The state court cited a number of U.S. Supreme Court rulings
dealing with the issue of state immunity from lawsuits. The state
court said the rulings are somewhat ambiguous but on the whole
support its decision barring Will's suit.
   In the appeal acted on today, Will said other state and federal
courts have held that states and state officials may be considered
``persons'' who are subject to being sued under federal civil
rights law.
   The case is Will vs. Michigan Department of State Police,
87-1207.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Freedom of Information Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will decide
whether public criminal records compiled by the FBI generally must
be released under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The justices agreed to study a Reagan administration attempt to
scuttle an FOIA lawsuit by a CBS News reporter and the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press aimed at obtaining such
documents.
   The FBI maintains identification records called ``rap sheets''
on some 24 million Americans, detailing arrest and conviction
information supplied by federal, state and local law enforcement
agencies.
   CBS correspondent Robert Schakne in 1978 sought all FBI records
of the arrests, indictments, and court dispositions of any charges
against four brothers, two of whom were identified as associates of
reputed Pennsylvania crime boss Russell Bufalino.
   Filed under the FOIA, a 1966 law aimed at curtailing government
secrecy, the request sought information about William, Phillip,
Samuel and Charles Medico.
   Schakne said he was trying to determine if the brothers had
criminal records because their firm, Medico Industries Inc., had
received lucrative defense contracts with the help of former Rep.
Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa.
   Schakne said he requested the FBI files as part of his reporting
on Flood, who had been charged with accepting $50,000 in bribes.
Flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on
probation.
   The Washington-based Reporters Committee later filed a similar
request.
   In 1980, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission identified Phillip,
Angelo and William Medico as members of the organized crime family
allegedly headed by Bufalino.
   The 1980 report said Bufalino regularly visited the Medico
family business near Wilkes-Barre, Pa., over a 20-year period.
   The report said Flood had used the Medico Industries box at a
local racetrack and attended Samuel Medico's funeral.
   Schakne confined his request to documents that were a ``matter
of public record.''
   The FBI first denied the request but later released the ``rap
sheet'' on the late William Medico.
   The bureau said it had no records on Phillip and Samuel, also
deceased, and refused to release its file on Charles Medico.
Government lawyers said releasing the information would violate
Medico's privacy.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last year rejected
Justice Department arguments that such FBI records are covered by
privacy exemptions contained in the 1966 law.
   One exemption authorizes withholding information if its
disclosure ``would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy.''
   Another, applying only to law enforcement records, authorizes
withholding if disclosure ``could reasonably be expecged to
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''
   The appeals court ordered U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn
to review the requested documents and determine if they were
considered public by Pennsylvania authorities.
   If so, the appeals court said, they are discloseable under the
FOIA.
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers noted that the
federal appeals court based in New York City has ruled that such
FBI documents are covered by FOIA privacy exemptions and can be
withheld.
   The case is U.S. Department of Justice vs. Reporters Committee,
87-1379.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Whether Scientology Payments May be Tax-Deductible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether payments, called ``fixed donations,'' made to the Church of
Scientology by its members may be claimed as federal income tax
deductions.
   The court's decision, expected sometime next year, will resolve
conflicting rulings by federal appeals courts.
   The case will be decided by a seven-member court. Justices
William J. Brennan and Anthony M. Kennedy disqualified themselves
today for unexplained reasons.
   The Internal Revenue Service says a payment made by Church of
Scientology members for ``auditing'' and training sessions is not a
charitable contribution that can be counted as a tax deduction.
   Scientologists say the IRS has singled out their church for
unfair treatment and is interfering with their religious freedom.
   Federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by
declaring various deductions, including money or things of value
given to charities or religious organizations. But such a payment
is not tax deductible if something of value is received in return.
   A practice within the Church of Scientology is a process known
as auditing, in which members are expected to reach a higher level
of spiritual awareness. Auditing is administered in a one-to-one
session in which the church member's skin responses to questions
are measured by an electronic device.
   The church also engages in training sessions, in which members
study the doctrines and practices of Scientology.
   The church charges a ``fixed donation'' for training and
auditing, and almost never waives the payment requirement.
   The U.S. Tax Court ruled in a 1984 test case that the fixed
donations required by the church are not tax-deductible
contributions but instead are non-deductible payments made for
services.
   The tax court said the payments ``were not voluntary transfers
without consideration but were made with the expectation of
receiving a commensurate benefit in return.''
   The individual Scientologists involved in the tax court decision
were Katherine Jean Graham of Honolulu, Richard M. Hermann of Los
Angeles and David F. Maynard of Rialto, Calif.
   Three federal appeals courts, in challenges by those
Scientologists and others to the tax court ruling, upheld the tax
court. But one _ the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals _ ruled for
the Scientologists.
   ``Participation in strictly religious practices is not a
recognizable return benefit (under federal tax law),'' the St.
Louis-based 8th Circuit court said.
   It added: ``Regardless of the timing of the payment or the
details of the church's method of soliciting contributions from its
members, an amount remitted to a qualified church with no return
other than participation in strictly spiritual and doctrinal
religious practices is a contribution within the meaning of (the
tax code).''
   In contrast, the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the payments by Scientologists are not tax-deductible.
   ``We find no indication that Congress intended to distinguish
the religious benefits sought (by a Scientologist trying to claim
his payments to the church as tax deductions) from ... other
benefits that could likewise provide the quid for the quo of a
non-deductible payment to a charitable organization,'' the 1st
Circuit court said.
   The justices chose the 1st Circuit court, involving Scientology
member Robert L. Hernandez, to study the issue. Court documents did
not indicate where Hernandez resides but he is represented by New
Haven, Conn., lawyer Michael J. Graetz.
   The case is Hernandez vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
87-963.

   An American tug and supply vessel was
reported safe today after being fired on by Iranians responding to
a U.S. attack in the Persian Gulf, a spokesman for the company that
owns the vessel said.
   ``My understanding is that it (the Willi Tide) was fired on, but
it was not hit,'' said Victor Koock, senior vice president and
general counsel for Tidewater Inc. ``All this is unconfirmed, but
that's what I was told a few minutes ago.''
   Koock said the 283-ton vessel sailed back to a Persian Gulf
port, probably in Dubai. He said a crew of about 12 people was
aboard, and he had no reports of injuries.
   The Willi Tide is a specialized vessel that carries supplies to
offshore oil platforms and is also equipped for towing.
   The attack on the Willi Tide came after U.S. warships destroyed
two offshore Iranian oil platforms and an Iranian patrol boat. Iran
responded by rocketing oil facilities and firing on at least two
U.S. vessels.
   The American attack was in retaliation for a mine explosion that
tore a hole in an American frigate last week, injuring 10 crewmen.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit reported
that Iranian boats attacking the Willi Tide fled after unidentified
warplanes swooped low over the scene.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Case Stemming from Falkland Islands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from the
1982 war over the Falkland Islands, today agreed to decide whether
Argentina may be sued in U.S. courts for attacking a neutral oil
tanker.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by Argentine
officials, supported by the Reagan administration, aimed at killing
the lawsuit.
   At issue is whether a foreign nation accused of violating
international law may be sued in federal courts in this country by
a foreign corporation engaged in U.S. trade.
   The case stems from an attack on the oil tanker Hercules by
Argentine aircraft on June 8, 1982. The ship was some 600 miles
from the Argentine coast and nearly 500 miles from the Falkland
Islands.
   Argentina and Great Britain were at war over control of the
islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas.
   The Hercules was owned by United Carriers Inc. and chartered by
Amerada Hess Shipping Corp. to carry oil from Alaska around the
southern tip of South America to a refinery in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
   United Carriers and Amerada Hess are both Liberian corporations.
   The Hercules was attacked despite a U.S. alert to Great Britain
and Argentina that it was among neutral vessels traveling in the
South Atlantic.
   The badly damaged tanker made it to port in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. But officials scuttled the ship on July 20, 1982, because
an unexploded bomb was embedded in one of its tanks.
   United Carriers sued Argentina for $10 million for the destroyed
tanker, and Amerada said it lost $2 million in fuel.
   The suit was filed in federal court in New York City after
Argentine officials refused to consider the claims. The companies
were unable to hire Argentine attorneys to pursue a suit in that
nation's courts.
   A U.S. federal judge threw out the suit but it was reinstated
last September by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court, in ordering a trial, rejected arguments that
Argentina was immune from being sued because of a 1976 U.S. law
granting foreign nations broad protection from such claims.
   The appeals court said that under a different law, enacted by
Congress in 1789, a foreign nation may be sued in U.S. courts by a
foreign corporation or foreign individual when the nation is
accused of violating international law or a U.S. treaty.
   ``It is beyond controversy that attacking a neutral ship in
international waters, without proper cause for suspicion or
investigation, violates international law,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that protections of sovereign immunity do not apply in
the same way that Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials after
World War II were not immune from prosecution.
   The Reagan administration said the appeals court ruling could
have dire consequences for U.S. foreign policy.
   ``The courts of the United States are not the proper forums for
the resolution of the legality of acts of foreign states,'' Justice
Department lawyers said. ``Sensitive foreign policy concerns are
implicated.''
   The government lawyers also said the appeals court decision
``threatens to turn the courts of the United States into tribunals
in which aliens generally (but not U.S. citizens) may seek redress
against foreign governments for conduct that has no substantial
nexus to the United States.''
   The case is Argentine Republic vs. Amerada Hess, 87-1372.

<TEXT>
   The city today dedicated a gleaming
monument to 300,000 Jews deported to Nazi deaths camps as its mayor
declared ``the struggle and courage of the Warsaw Ghetto will not
be forgotten.''
   `It is here where the kingdom of night reigned at its
cruelest,'' Miles Lehrman, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Council, told the crowd of 3,000 gathered in Warsaw at the site of
the World War II deportations.
   The dedication came in observances of the 45th anniversary of
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, when fighters from Jewish district's
last 70,000 people put up a desperate three-week resistance to the
final Nazi onslaught.
   The government has shown a mixed reaction to anniversary
observances. It initially branded as illegal a commemorative rally
including speakers from the outlawed trade federation Solidarity.
However, it did not intervene when the rally took place Sunday.
   In addition, authorities plan a huge observance of the
anniversary of the uprising, which began April 19, 1943. It will be
held Tuesday at the city's Ghetto Fighters Monument.
   Today, a military honor guard joined the crowd at Umschlagplatz
square for the morning dedication ceremony in sunny, breezy
weather. The crowd included Poles, Israelis, and other Jews from
around the world _ some children of concentration camp victims.
   The Umschlagplatz memorial was unveiled by Henryk Jablonski,
head of the Polish veterans association, which has organized the
official anniversary observances.
   Umschlagplatz, on the edge of the walled Jewish ghetto
established in Warsaw by the Nazis in 1940, was the square where
Jews were loaded into boxcars for the fatal trip to the Nazi camps
at Treblinka and Majdanek.
   ``Let subsequent generations remember about the tragedy of 45
years ago. The Jews of Warsaw, peace to their memory,'' Warsaw
Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski told the crowd.
   Israeli flags fluttered as a long line of people carrying flower
wreaths moved toward the monument, a marble rectangle inscribed
with the names of some of the victims of the 1942-43 deportations.
   Polish officials said today that a service station a few yards
from the monument would stay closed. It had offended the monument's
designer, Hanna Szmalenberg, and some of the foreign visitors.
   Three million Polish Jews and 3 million non-Jewish Poles were
killed from 1939-45, mostly in deliberate executions and death
camps.
   At the end of the war, only a few hundred thousand of Poland's
pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million remained. Today, the
country's Jewish population is less then 10,000, mostly elderly
people.

   The Supreme Court today left intact a $2.08
million award to the family of a Texas cowboy who died of leukemia
after a medicine for cattle and horses seeped into his cuts and
bruises.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the medicine
manufacturer ordered to pay the damages.
   Clois Osburn, who worked as a cowboy in the Texas panhandle,
began in 1982 to administer to sick calves an antibiotic drug
called veterinary chloramphenicol.
   Osburn would pour the drug from its original bottle into another
bottle that had a rubber lid into which a needle could be inserted.
   He said the medicine frequently leaked from the rubber-topped
container and got into scratches and cuts on his arm.
   Osburn was 42 when he was diagnosed in February 1984 as having
leukemia. He died in July 1987.
   Osburn and his wife, Anita, sued Anchor Laboratories Inc. and
Rachelle Laboratories Inc., manufacturers of the drug. They said
the companies failed to warn users of the medicine's dangers, and
that such a failure violated a Texas law protecing against personal
injuries.
   Anchor Labs agreed to a settlement, paying the Osburns $225,000.
A federal jury awarded the Osburns $2.5 million against Rahcelle
Labs, a sum later reduced to $2.08 million by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   Rachelle Labs said the verdict is unfair because its warning
label on the drug was approved by the federal Food and Drug
Administration.
   The company said it could not comply with the FDA labeling
regulations and at the same time use a label that would fulfill its
obligations to comply with Texas law.
   But the 5th Circuit court said the FDA regulations ``did not
prevent Rachelle from adding to its label warnings of the dangers
of fatal blood diseases associated with exposure to
chloramphenicol.''
   The appeals court also said there had been enough evidence for
the jury to decide that Osburn's leukemia was caused by the drug.
   The case is Rachelle Laboratories vs. Anita Osburn, 87-1496.

<HEAD>Court Won't Hear Airline's Challenge to NY Regulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear Delta
Air Lines' challenge to a rule barring it from offering nonstop
flights between Salt Lake City and New York City's LaGuardia
Airport.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that a
so-called ``perimeter rule'' in effect for LaGuardia _ prohibiting
nonstop flights to or from points more than 1,500 miles away _ is
valid.
   LaGuardia is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which also runs Kennedy International Airport and Newark
International Airport in the metropolitan New York area.
   Until 1984, the Port Authority's perimeter rule for LaGuardia
was informal and barred flights to or from points more than 2,000
miles away. The authority in 1984 imposed a formal 1,500-mile
perimeter rule but allowed flights to and from Denver, which is
1,600 miles away, to continue.
   Delta in 1986 sought to operate nonstop flights between
LaGuardia and Salt Lake City International Airport. The
Atlanta-based airline had operated such flights between Kennedy
Airport and Salt Lake City for some years.
   When the authority rejected the request, Delta sued. It charged
that the local rule violated a federal law banning state or local
agencies from enforcing any rule ``relating to rates, routes or
services of any air carrier.''
   A federal judge dismissed the suit, ruling that the perimeter
rule is a valid exercise of the Port Authority's ``proprietary
powers.''
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last
year.
   Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to reject the
Delta appeal acted on today.
   They said the 2nd Circuit court's decision is limited to those
state or local agencies operating more than one airport.
   ``Since there is no indication that any other proprietor is
likely to impose a perimeter rule, this decision is unlikely to
have any significant impact upon the national air transportation
system,'' the government lawyers said.
   The case is Delta Air Lines vs. Port Authority, 87-333.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Rulings on Public School Teachers in Texas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand rulings that
public school teachers have no right under federal law to block
public review of their college transcripts.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that such
information is protected under a 1974 federal law aimed at ensuring
students' privacy rights.
   A Houston school district and one of its teachers sued in 1986
in an attempt to keep her college transcript from being released
under the Texas Open Records Act.
   Two members of the public had requested that Donald Collins,
superintendent of schools for the Klein Independent School
District, release the ``personnel file and other related public
records'' of Rebecca Holt, a teacher.
   Collins then requested an opinion from state Attorney General
Jim Mattox concerning whether Ms. Holt's college transcript could
be withheld.
   Collins was told the transcript had to be released under the
state's Open Records Act.
   The ensuing federal lawsuit contended that a federal law, the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, authorized
withholding the transcript from public release.
   The federal law is aimed at limiting the authority of school
officials to release students' transcripts without the consent of
the students or their parents.
   The suit filed by the school district and Ms. Holt contended
that the federal law pre-empts enforcement of the state law.
   A federal trial judge threw out the suit, ruling that the
federal law does not apply when a school is asked to release the
transcript of one of its employees.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last
Oct. 22.
   ``Excluded from FERPA's protections are records relating to an
individual who is employed by an educational agency or
institution,'' the appeals court ruled.
   It emphasized ``the right of the public to know the academic
records of the schoolteachers of their children,'' adding,
``Recently there has been grave concern in Texas about the quality
of public education ... Many teachers who had been certified and
were teaching in Texas classrooms could not pass a basic test of
minimal competency.''
   The appeals court said, ``In light of this apparent lack of
competency prevalent in the state, the public must have full and
complete information concerning the teachers who serve the public
in educating their children.''
   The case is Klein Independent School District vs. Mattox,
87-1417,

   James E. Olson, the forceful chairman of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. who got his start cleaning silt
out of manholes, died early today of cancer. He was 62.
   Olson, who had led the telecommunications giant since the fall
of 1986, had been operated on last month for a tumor in the colon.
   AT&T President Robert E. Allen, who took over after Olson became
ill last month, will continue to direct the company until the board
of directors elects a new chairman, company spokeswoman Lynda
Beighley said.
   AT&T's directors will meet around the time of the annual meeting
Wednesday in Denver, but Ms. Beighley said she could not say if a
chairman would be picked at that time.
   Olson became ill with flu on March 18 and had surgery seven days
later. He returned home April 1 and had been undergoing
chemotherapy as an outpatient since that time. He died at home.
   ``All of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of
Jim's death,'' Allen said in a statement. ``He was a dynamic and
visionary leader. We will miss him. Our legacy to him will be the
vigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out for
us during his 20 months as our leader.''
   Allen, 52, is the company's president and chief operating
officer.
   Olson had made AT&T more aggressive, more cost-conscious and
more certain of its direction since taking office in September 1986.
   Analysts said the company had drifted in the first years after
the breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1, 1984, when local phone
service was split into seven regional Bell holding companies.
   Olson, who landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17,
was considered a take-charge executive with an emphasis on getting
results. Disdaining the fashion of corporate boardrooms, the beefy
executive wore short-sleeved shirts throughout his career.
   ``Jim Olson was the ultimate tough guy. ... I think he instilled
a real sense of pride and determination in an AT&T workforce that
at that time needed it,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   ``I think he leaves AT&T in good hands,'' Grubman said. ``If
this had happened a year ago, it would have been extremely
disruptive.''
   Allen is widely considered to be AT&T's almost certain choice as
a successor to Olson. ``He is a big-picture guy,'' Grubman said.
``His style is probably more overtly executive (than Olson's),'' he
said.
   Olson, a native of Devils Lake, N.D., was born Dec. 3, 1925. His
first job, in which he cleaned manholes, was as a splicer's helper
in 1943 with Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. in Grand Forks, N.D.
   Twenty-three years later Olson had moved through the ranks of
the company to become vice president and general manager for Iowa.
He was transferred to Indiana Bell as vice president for operations
in 1970 and became president of that company two years later.
   In 1974, Olson assumed the presidency of Illinois Bell and in
1977 became executive vice president of AT&T headquarters in New
York City. He was made president and chief operating officer in
June 1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979.
   Olson was a graduate of the University of North Dakota and
served on the boards of many companies, business organizations and
charitable groups.
   Olson's undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of William
McGowan, the chairman of AT&T's long-distance rival MCI
Communications Corp., who suffered a heart attack in December 1986,
received a heart transplant and returned to office in September
1987.
   Both companies drew criticism for failing to announce their
chiefs' illnesses until news leaked to the press.
   Olson is survived by his wife, Jean; a son, James D. Olson; a
daughter, Mrs. Bruce Paterson; one brother and two sisters.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Lawsuit Against FAA Stemming from
California Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration stemming from
an airplane crash near Bishop, Calif., that killed 36 people in
1974.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that the FAA is
immune from charges that its negligence contributed to the accident.
   A Sierra Pacific Airline charter flight crashed into a foothill
of the White Mountains the night of March 13, 1974, just after
taking off from Bishop Airport.
   Relatives of some of the crash victims sued the FAA, charging
that there was inadequate ground lighting near the airport and that
the FAA negligently had failed to conduct night test flights before
publishing an approved departure procedure.
   The suit was filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, a law that
waives the government's sovereign immunity and allows it to be sued
in some instances.
   But lower courts ruled that the FAA officials who investigated
safety conditions at the Bishop Airport and prepareed departure
procedures for use there were acting ``within the scope of the
discretionary function exception'' to the FTCA.
   The government may not be sued under the law if the allegedly
wrongful actions stemmed from a government official's discretionary
authority.
   The case is West vs. U.S., 87-1270.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Rule in Leg-Iron Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to rule that
convicted killers never are denied fair sentencing trials when
jurors see them in leg irons.
   The court, without comment or a dissenting vote, rejected
Florida prosecutors' argument that using shackles at sentencing
trials _ as opposed to trials on guilt or innocence _ is not
inherently prejudicial because jurors already know the defendant is
guilty of a violent crime.
   William Duane Elledge was convicted of killing Margaret Anne
Strack in Hollywood, Fla., in 1975 and also was convicted of two
subsequent murders in Jacksonville.
   His original death sentence for the Strack murder was
overturned, but in 1977 Elledge was resentenced to death for that
crime.
   The presiding judge ordered that Elledge be placed in leg irons
during the second sentencing trial. The judge explained before a
jury was selected, and outside the presence of potential jurors,
that Elledge purportedly had become an expert in karate while
imprisoned and planned to attack the court bailiff.
   The judge said he received that information from a county jail
official.
   Elledge asked if he could ``say something'' about the judge's
order but he was not allowed to do so.
   In striking down Elledge's death sentence, the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last July said, ``The state at no time made any
showing that the shackling was necessary to further an essential
state interest.''
   The appeals court noted that Elledge was not given ``an adequate
opportunity to challenge the untested information that served as
the basis for the shackling.''
   Even though the sentencing jury knew Elledge had committed a
gruesome crime, his appearance at the sentencing trial in leg irons
was ``inherently prejudicial'' and should not have been required
without proof to substantiate the report on which the judge relied,
the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth argued, ``In the exercise of common sense, the jurors
could not have been inherently prejudiced (by seeing Elledge
shackled) when they knew, from the outset of his sentencing
proceeding, that he was a convicted murderer.''
   The case is Dugger vs. Elledge, 87-1234.

<HEAD>New Ferry Service Starts; $2.5 Billion Needed for Bridges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferry service across the East River began this
morning for some of the nearly 250,000 travelers denied use of the
decrepit Williamsburg Bridge.
   The first boat moved out at 7 a.m. from a hastily built pier
near the Brooklyn side of the bridge and made the 15-minute voyage
to connect with subways at the tip of Manhattan.
   The bridge, a vital link between Manhattan and Queens and
Brooklyn, was closed to cars, trucks and subways last week when
inspectors found it decaying from rust, corrosion and years of
neglect.
   The inauguration of the ferry was ``very smooth,'' according to
Transportation Department spokesman Victor Ross. Transportation
Commissioner Ross Sandler was on hand for a ceremonial opening at a
later departure.
   Sandler said Sunday that ``to get the 371 city bridges with a
poor or fair rating to a good or better rating, we'll have to spend
$2.5 billion'' over the next 10 years. He said the figure would go
up another half billion if the Williamsburg must be replaced.
   He said inspectors were half finished with their examination of
the Williamsburg and ``there's nothing that we've found so far that
we won't be able to fix.''
   Fliers advertising the ferry service are being distributed in
English, Spanish and Yiddish; there is a large orthodox Jewish
population in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
   The city is using two of its smaller ferries, each capable of
carrying 1,280 passengers, that normally run between Staten Island
and Manhattan at night and on weekends.

   The president of Penn State University
today agreed to drop all criminal and university charges against 89
protesters who staged a sit-in over minority issues at a campus
building.
   President Bryce Jordan agreed to full amnesty for the activists,
most of them black students, at a meeting this morning with student
leaders and his top administrators.
   ``Legal force does not help us to solve our problems,'' Jordan
said at the meeting, attended by about 200 people at the Paul
Robeson Cultural Center.
   Sekou Garrett, one of the student activists, asked that total
amnesty be granted to protesters before discussions began on issues
that prompted the sit-ins.
   Police arrested 89 protesters April 9, ending a 15-hour sit-in
at the university's telecommunications building. Students staged
the sit-in when Jordan canceled another meeting because ground
rules could not be agreed upon in advance.
   Students expected an open meeting, while Jordan sent two senior
administrators to the Robeson Center April 8 for a closed-door
meeting.
   Jordan agreed to the earlier meeting to end an 11-hour sit-in by
nine black students and a local pastor outside his office. Three
other students also occupied that building as a show of solidarity.
   The students involved in the sit-ins have complained about the
low number of blacks enrolled at Penn State.
   Last fall the school failed to reach a court-mandated goal of 5
percent black enrollment. The university has 2,424 blacks
throughout the state system, 3.6 percent of its 67,278 students.

<TEXT>
   A member of Kuwait's royal family, held
hostage aboard a jumbo jet, said today he wants his government to
give in to the hijackers' demand and free 17 terrorists imprisoned
in Kuwait.
   Speaking extremely slowly and in a tired voice, a man identified
by the Arab hijackers as Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah said: ``I hope
Kuwait releases all the prisoners.'' He then mumbled something
unintelligible, and added ``Thanks to God.''
   The control tower at Algiers Houari Boumedienne Airport asked in
English that the statement be repeated. One of the hijackers then
got on the radio and replied: ``He doesn't want to talk.''
   Reports from a hostage freed earlier said that Al-Sabah was in
very bad condition, apparently suffering from a nervous disorder.
Two other members of the royal family, Al-Sabah's sisters, also are
aboard Kuwait Airways Flight 422.
   The Thailand-to-Kuwait flight was hijacked April 5 with 112
people aboard and forced to land in Mashhad, Iran, where 57 were
released. On April 8, the jet flew to Cyprus, where two passengers
were killed and 13 freed. Since landing in Algiers one passenger
has been freed, leaving about 35 hostages, including the three
members of Kuwait's extensive royal family.
   The five to eight hijackers are demanding the release of the 17
men jailed for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in
1983.
   Kuwait has refused the demand.
   The Shiite Moslem hijackers are armed with grenades and guns and
have threatened to blow up the plane.
   Algerian officials privately expressed hope the gunmen might
free one or more of their estimated 35 hostages early today as a
gesture of goodwill to mark the beginning of the monthlong fast of
Ramadan, traditionally a period of reconciliation for devout
Moslems.
   The hijackers demanded a special Ramadan meal before dawn, but
no hostage had been released when the fast began at daybreak.
   On Sunday, a passenger radioed a message to the control tower
saying that the hostages faced certain death if the 17 pro-Iranian
prisoners were not freed by Kuwait.
   A man aboard the jet, who identified himself as Suleiman Farhan
Doukhi, said in the message: ``All the passengers are in good
health. I hope the Kuwait government will act quickly to liberate
the 17 young prisoners. Otherwise, we all face a black end.''
   Three other passengers have made similar statements since the
plane landed in Algiers early Wednesday.
   During the night, Algerian negotiators repeatedly went to the
plane. Around 2 a.m. (9 p.m. Sunday EDT), three Algerian security
vehicles shuttled across the tarmac, going separately two and from
the aircraft.
   Algerian television cameras caught one of the hijackers coming
down off the plane during the night to negotiate with unidentified
persons in a car near the jetliner.
   The Algerian camera showed a hooded man coming to the bottom of
the stairs and, after a few minutes, returning to the plane and
coming down again with a second man. They stayed in the car about
15 minutes.
   Contacts intensified Sunday between President Chadli Bendjedid
of Algeria and other Arab heads of state. Saudi Arabian King Fahd,
Kuwaiti ruler Shiek Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi all reportedly spoke by telephone with Bendjedid
during the day.
   Algerian authorities abruptly expelled hundreds of reporters
Sunday from the section of the VIP lounge where they had been
staying for nearly a week.
   One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
lounge was needed for Arab ambassadors expected to come to the
airport for a possible expansion of the negotiations. The official
declined to provide any details.
   Algerian officials said that Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat was expected in Algiers but declined to say
when he would arrive or whether he would play a role in the
negotiations.
   The gunmen, who have threatened to fly the jet out of Algeria
``to settle our score with Kuwait somewhere else,'' agreed on
Sunday to delay their departure to pursue negotiations.
   There has been no indication of where they might go if they left
Algiers.

<TEXT>
   The wife of this city's police chief
has been charged with trying to hire someone to kill her husband.
   Sheila Faircloth, wife of Police Chief Warren Faircloth, was
charged by the U.S. Customs Service and the State Attorney's Office
with solicitation to commit first-degree murder, authorities said.
   Mrs. Faircloth was arrested Friday, and the charges were
revealed Saturday. No motive was known. Mrs. Faircloth was taken to
the Bay County Jail in Panama City because the Franklin County Jail
lacks facilities for female prisoners.
   State Attorney Willie Meggs said customs officials had picked up
on Mrs. Faircloth's search for a contract killer and an agent
called her up and suggested he was in the business.
   ``She was seeking someone to do the job, and we volunteered to
do the job,'' said Meggs.
   While authorities put the case together over the period of about
a month, the customs agent and Mrs. Faircloth discussed specifics
on the death plan.
   Meggs said he understood that the hired killer was to be paid
off with a percentage of the property and money the woman would get
after her husband's death.
   Meggs said Faircloth didn't know of his wife's plans until
authorities notified him Friday.
   Meggs said he didn't know what motive was behind Mrs.
Faircloth's plan.

   The arrest of student activists who
staged a sit-in over minority issues has cast a shadow of
uncertainty over Penn State University's efforts to recruit blacks
for next fall, officials say.
   ``The timing of this couldn't be any worse,'' said Scott F.
Healy, Penn State's admissions director, explaining that parents
are sitting down with college-bound offspring now to decide which
school they'll attend this fall.
   ``When you show a student being escorted out of a building in
handcuffs, it isn't a positive image of education,'' Healy said.
   More than 150 students, most of them black, occupied Penn
State's telecommunications building April 8 when university
President Bryce Jordan canceled a meeting with nine black students
who had staged a sit-in outside his office three days earlier.
   Police arrested 89 protesters who remained in the
telecommunications building the next morning.
   Jordan convened an open meeting today with student leaders to
discuss minority issues and agreed to drop all criminal and
university charges against the protesters.
   The outcome of the meeting will heavily influence minority
recruitment for this fall, said Vice Provost Carol Cartwright, who
chairs the university's Equal Opportunity Planning Committee.
   Before the protests, minority applications were up 7 percent
over last year, Healy said. He acknowledged that the arrests could
scare off some minority students.
   ``It could say to minorities, `This is not the place I want to
go for the next four years,''' he said.
   The students involved in the sit-ins have complained of the low
number of blacks enrolled at Penn State, and are expected to
include better minority recruitment in their demands at the meeting.
   Last fall, Penn State failed to reach a court-mandated goal of 5
percent black enrollment. The university has 2,424 blacks
throughout the state system, 3.6 percent of its 67,278 students.
   Courtney Pinkney, president of the student Black Caucus, agrees
the arrests and the publicity surrounding them may have hurt
minority recruitment.
   ``In no way can they blame the black students,'' Ms. Pinkney
said. ``If things would have been correct from the beginning, this
wouldn't have happened.''
   Student activists have not spelled out the demands they plan to
present at the meeting, but protester Robert Blair said they would
be similar to those made by a group of students at a Board of
Trustees meeting last November.
   At that meeting, students complained about low numbers of black
students and faculty, requested the creation of the post of vice
president for minority affairs, and asked that all undergraduates
be required to take black studies.
   In 1986, black students at Penn State's State College campus
stopped helping admissions recruiters and spread word the school
wasn't a good place for blacks.
   ``When you have your own students working against you, it is
very difficult if not impossible to turn the situation around and
get black and Hispanic students to come,'' Healy said.
   This spring, with the admissions office's blessing, students
from the Black Caucus began meeting with minority applicants to
tell them what life at the school is like.
   ``The students wanted to be convinced we were telling the
truth,'' said Gary Kelsey, director of the division of minority
admissions and community affairs.
   Ms. Pinkney, a senior from Philadelphia, said she was recruited
by Penn State when she was in 10th grade.
   ``I thought Penn State was the greatest place on Earth when I
got here. I thought it was very unfortunate and very unfair I was
not told the real deal,'' she said.

<HEAD>Court to Study Rights of Unwed Fathers in Adoptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study the
rights of unwed fathers whose children are put up for adoption by
their mothers.
   At issue: Whether unwed fathers who actively seek custody of
their children may be stripped of all parental rights if adoption
is deemed to be in the childrens' best interest.
   The justices said they will use a case from San Diego, Calif.,
to review rulings that terminated Edward McNamara's parental rights
to his daughter, Katie, who is now 6 years old.
   McNamara and Katie's mother, unidentified in court records, had
not seen each other for eight months when Katie was born in 1981.
McNamara did not learn of the pregnancy or birth until he was told
Katie, then a month old, had been placed in a foster home awaiting
adoption.
   He quickly sought custody.
   Katie was 5 months old before a trial was held on McNamara's
custody request, and a California judge ruled that it was in
Katie's best interest to stay with the foster parents she had been
living with.
   The foster parents wanted to adopt Katie, and the judge ruled
that the baby girl had ``bonded'' with them.
   The judge acknowledged that McNamara was a ``good parent (who)
can provide a good, loving home for the child.''
   The California Supreme Court reversed the ruling, stating that
custody could not be awarded to a non-parent unless awarding
custody of the child to one of its parents who sought custody would
be detrimental to the child.
   The state's highest court sent the case back to a trial court to
determine whether the passage of time had made an award of custody
to McNamara detrimental for Katie, by then adopted.
   The trial court in 1985 ruled against McNamara, and stripped him
of all of his parental rights to Katie. The judge, however,
encouraged Katie's adoptive parents to make Edward part of Katie's
life.
   In the appeal acted on today, McNamara argued that his treatment
in the California courts violated his equal-protection rights.
   He noted that wed fathers cannot lose their parental rights
unless they are found to have no interest or ability in parenting
the child.
   And he noted that unwed mothers would not lose their parental
rights under similar circumstances.
   The justices agreed to study the case and, if they find they
have the proper jurisdiction, to rule on whether McNamara received
fair treatment.
   In other action the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether states may bar political party
leaders from endorsing primary election candidates and whether
states may regulate political party structure.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating parts of a
California law overturned as infringements on citizens' rights to
express themselves and associate with whom they please.
   _ Refused to let a Dallas blood bank withhold the names and
medical records of its donors from a woman who says her husband
contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that donors'
privacy rights do not override Patty Jo Baker's need to find out
their identities for her wrongful-death lawsuit.
   _ Left intact a key federal regulation designed to foster
competition within the natural gas industry.
   The justices, without comment, rejected appeals by pipeline
companies that claim the rule places them in an unfair economic
bind.
   _ Rejected an appeal by U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings, who
says he unlawfully is being subjected to possible impeachment.
   The court, without comment, left intact a 1980 law under which
fellow judges asked the House of Representatives to consider
impeaching Hastings for alleged judicial misconduct.
   _ Refused to let the government approve the use in cosmetics of
color additives that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the cosmetics
industry that safe substances are being forced off the market.
   _ Let stand a ruling that a worker may not be fired for refusing
on religious grounds to pay union dues.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a machinists
union in Seattle seeking to force a Boeing Co. employee to pay
union dues.
   _ Said it will decide whether public criminal records compiled
by the FBI generally must be released under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   The justices agreed to study a Reagan administration attempt to
scuttle an FOIA lawsuit by a CBS News reporter and the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press aimed at obtaining such
documents.
   _ Agreed to decide whether payments, called ``fixed donations'',
made to the Church of Scientology by its members may be claimed as
federal income tax deductions.
   The court's decision, expected sometime next year, will resolve
conflicting rulings by federal appeals courts.
   The adoption case is McNamara vs. San Diego County, 87-5840.

   The Supreme Court today was urged to kill a
lawsuit aimed at stripping the Catholic Church of its tax-exempt
status because of its anti-abortion lobbying.
   Permitting the suit would open the way to a host of legal
challenges against tax exemptions for any religion, said Kevin T.
Baine, a lawyer representing the Catholic Church officials.
   ``You can substitute any church ... any controversial issue,''
he said.
   But Marshall Beil, a lawyer for ``pro-choice'' groups and
individuals, argued that the tax exemption for the Catholics ``is
skewing the political process'' by giving the church an unfair
advantage in the national debate over abortion.
   Only the courts ``can create a remedy,'' he said. ``The
political process can't.''
   The justices have been asked to decide whether the
``pro-choice'' coalition has the required legal standing to sue the
federal government in hopes of forcing revocation of the church's
tax exemptions.
   But several justices hinted during 60 minutes of arguments that
they might order further lower court examination of the issue.
   They expressed concern that a federal appeals court had not
decided the legal standing issue unambiguously.
   The high court is faced also with another key procedural issue:
whether the Catholic Church had a right to appeal a contempt
citation issued by a federal judge for its failure to turn over
documents in the case.
   The question is whether a witness _ rather than one of the
opposing sides in a lawsuit _ has such a right of appeal prior to
the outcome of the case.
   The justices are expected to announce their decision by July.
   Alan I. Horowitz, a Justice Department lawyer, argued in support
of the church's position.
   He said that a ruling in favor of the ``pro-choice'' groups and
individuals could ``expose the government to untold suits by people
interested but not affected by the outcome'' of federal regulations.
   The ``pro-choice'' coalition sued in 1980, accusing the
government of helping to subsidize the church's anti-abortion
lobbying through tax breaks.
   The federal tax code generally bars tax-exempt organizations
from spending money on political activities.
   A federal judge in New York City held the church in civil
contempt in May 1986 for refusing to supply records to those suing
the government. The judge ordered the church to pay $100,000 a day
until it supplied the documents.
   But the contempt ruling has been put on hold pending the outcome
of the church's appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled that the
``pro-choice'' groups and individuals have legal standing to sue
the government.
   The appeals court said the ``pro-choice'' forces claim the
government's failure to enforce the tax code places them ``at a
competitive disadvantage with the Catholic Church in the arena of
public advocacy on important public issues.''
   The Reagan administration has taken the church's side.
Government lawyers argue that allowing the suit to survive would
encourage other suits by those dissatisfied with the tax treatment
given groups with opposing views.
   Even if the suits eventually fail, Justice Department lawyers
have told the court, they would give people unwarranted access to
the courts and a means of forcing adversaries to reveal sensitive
information.
   The case is U.S. Catholic Conference vs. Abortion Rights
Mobilization, 87-416.

<HEAD>Egypt Says U.S. Reprisal Justifiable, Britain Backs Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt today accused Iran of provoking a new
round of military hostilities in the Persian Gulf and said today's
American attacks on two Iranian oil platforms were justified.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Iran invited the
American retaliation by laying new mines in the gulf. He urged the
Tehran government to desist from an ``unsound and unwise'' policy.
   ``Iran's return to mine-laying in the gulf damaged a U.S.
military vessel on April 14 and, in doing so, Iran initiated a new
wave of military confrontation in the region,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
   ``We understand the American response and we urge Iran to stop
its policy of provoking others.''
   Britain, meanwhile, backed the U.S. strike against the platforms
and deplored a subsequent Iranian gunboat attack on a British
tanker in the waterway.
   The Foreign Office said Britain was seeking information about
the attack on the 60,184-ton York Marine off the southern gulf
emirate of Sharjah.
   ``We deplore it obviously,'' said a spokesman, who requested
anonymity.
   Gulf-based shipping executives said the fully-loaded oil tanker
York Marine was on fire and its crew had abandoned ship.
   Washington said the attack was launched to punish Iran for the
mine that blew a hole in the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts. The
explosion Thursday injured 10 crewmen.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported today's U.S. attack.
   ``We are satisfied from the evidence we have that the mines were
laid by Iran and that the U.S. reaction was entirely justified as a
proportionate response,'' she told reporters.
   Britain has two destroyers and two minesweepers in the gulf. It
said it had not been informed the York Marine was in the waterway
but would have given it protection if asked.

<HEAD>Commission Calls for Appointment of Aviation Safety Czar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential commission called today for
major changes in the way the government regulates the airlines,
including more inspections of air carriers and appointment of an
aviation ``safety czar'' with broad authority.
   After months of examining aviation safety, the seven-member
panel concluded that ``the air transportation system is safe'' but
added ``safety is being maintained to an increasing extent through
delays and other inconveniences.''
   And the commission said, ``While the (air transport) system is
safe for now, the present governmental structure is not working
effectively enough to ensure its safety in the future.''
   The panel urged Congress to enact legislation that would split
the Federal Aviation Administration away from the Transportation
Department into an independent agency with power shared by an
administrator and a director of aviation safety.
   This director would be ``in effect a `safety czar' whose sole
responsibility would be to ensure the safety of the (aviation)
system,'' said John Albertine, the commission's chairman, in
announcing the recommendations. The director would have the
authority to initiate safety regulations or block regulations
initiated by the agency.
   The commission, which was created by Congress, was directed by
President Reagan last year to examine aviation safety and make
recommendations on how the federal government could improve its
regulation of the airline industry.
   In the past year there has been increased pressure to make
sweeping changes in the organization of the FAA. Suggestions have
ranged from making it a semi-private agency and possibly taking air
traffic controllers out of the government altogether to keeping the
agency in the Transportation Department.
   In a two-volume report, the President's Commission on Aviation
Safety, urged that the FAA remain part of the government to
maintain public accountability, but as an independent agency with
an administrator and an aviation safety director, both of whom
would be appointed for seven-year terms.
   The commission also urged an increase in federal inspectors to
keep up better with the rapidly changing airline industry and
called for establishing a broader airline inspection program. It
urged the adoptions of ``surprise inspections'' of air carriers as
well as special inspections for airlines undergoing rapid change.
   The commission noted that the FAA is committed to hiring
additional inspectors and has increased the number to more than
2,000 from a low of 1,494 five years ago. Because of continuing
inspector staff shortages ``significant portions of the (FAA's)
surveillance program are not being executed,'' the commission said.
   The FAA currently is committed to major, in-depth inspections of
Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines, both subsidiaries of
Texas Air Corp., and also has underway a special series of
inspections of commuter airlines in addition to its routine
inspection duties.
   The commission also concluded, among other things, that:
   _ A new and independent FAA should be given additional
flexibility, including less rigid personnel and procurement
requirements, to deal better with the rapidly changing airline
industry.
   _ Commuter airlines should gradually be required to conform to
the same federal requirements as larger airlines.
   _ Small, private planes flying near any hub airports should be
required to have equipment that tells controllers altitude
information.
   In addition to Albertine, who is vice chairman of Farley
Industries, the commission members are: S. John Byington, a partner
in the firm of Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro; Joseph Kalt, a
professor at the School of Government at Harvard; Michael Levine, a
professor at Yale University and former executive of New York Air;
Russell Meyer, chairman of Cessna Aircraft Co.; John Robson, dean
of the School of Business Administration at Emory University and a
former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board; and Thomas Wathen,
president of CPP Pinkerton Inc.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks reopened in Panama today for
the first time in six weeks but only to receive deposits. Business
was brisk but most customers appeared wary.
   Most people deposited checks, which they have been unable to
cash since the banks were closed on March 4.
   ``I'll keep my cash at home,'' said Frank Farrell, one of about
20 people lined up to make deposits at Chase Manhattan Bank when it
opened. ``Later on, maybe, I'll deposit cash.''
   A retiree, Farrell said he was depositing about a half dozen
dividend checks. Asked if he felt secure in depositing them, he
replied: ``I don't worry. Chase is solid.''
   A middle-aged Panamanian woman in the same line said she also
was depositing checks only.
   ``I need the cash to eat,'' she said.
   It was unclear when the banks would allow withdrawals.
   The banks reopened today after the National Banking Commission,
the government's bank regulator, said the banks could resume
accepting deposits and carrying out inter-bank operations.
   They were closed March 3 after a month-long run on deposits
turned into a stampede in late February when Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the nation's strongman, dismissed then President Eric
Arturo Delvalle.
   The Reagan administration furthered the economic crisis by
imposing sanctions on Panama, including freezing Panamanian assets
in the United States, in an effort to force Noriega to leave his
post.
   Noriega, chief of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces, is
under federal indictment in the United States on charges of drug
trafficking and money laundering.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle as the nation's leader.
Delvalle was deposed after he ordered Noriega to step down.
   In other developments, a Roman Catholic priest on Sunday told
worshipers not to be intimidated by riot police who have crushed
demonstrations against Noriega.
   Hundreds of people stood and cheered repeatedly during the
homily by the Rev. Javier Villanueva at the Christ the King Church.
   ``There is no suffering, no blow from a truncheon or a stream of
poisonous water, nor an insult, nor criticism, nor pain that does
not form part of the suffering of Christ,'' he told about 500
people.
   On Saturday, police trucks equipped with water cannons fired a
mixture of tear gas and water at about 400 demonstrators, most of
whom were members of an opposition women's group, during a march on
the north side of Panama City.

<TEXT>
   A West German computer ``hacker''
electronically raided about 50 U.S. military computers containing
defense and aerospace information, a prosecutor said today.
   The 24-year-old student gained access to the computers for
almost two years through his own computer and telephone links,
according to the West German newsmagazine Quick.
   Some of the raided computers are at the Air Force Systems
Command in El Segundo, Calif., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasedena, Calif., said Hans-Georg von Bock, prosecuting attorney
in Bremen.
   FBI spokesmen said their agency was investigating. They declined
to say whether charges would be filed.
   Bock refused to say what the student, who is from Hanover,
discovered in his computer break-ins. Quick said the student was
able to find out the names of U.S. Army officers in Japan and
details about U.S. coastal security systems.
   However, no one said whether the man uncovered any important
secrets.
   Bock said Bremen authorities had abandoned their inquiry for
lack of evidence. Bock refused to provide any details about the
suspect _ including his name _ because the investigation had been
dropped.
   ``We wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but
unfortunately that did not happen,'' Bock said.
   He said the electronic links were made by telephone via a
computer at Bremen University.
   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven who
originated these calls,'' Bock said.
   Hackers are computer enthusiasts who try to gain unauthorized
access to other computers through telephone lines. Some hackers say
they commit their electronic break-ins just for fun.
   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986
by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., which does
unclassified research. The laboratory and its sister institution,
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which is involved in nuclear
weapons research and the Strategic Defense Initiative known as
``Star Wars,'' are operated by the University of California for the
U.S. government.
   Quick said authorities questioned the student in June and the
break-ins stopped at about that time.
   Bock said West German investigators had been handicapped because
German law prevents them from tapping telephones unless they
suspect a more serious crime, such as murder.

   Irving Bank Corp., facing a hostile tender offer
from Bank of New York Co., said today that it has accepted a
$65-a-share cash tender offer from Banca Commerciale Italiana for
51 percent of its common shares.
   The offer, valued at between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, also
includes a special dividend of $10 per share payable to Irving
shareholders upon completion of the deal, said Irving spokesman D.
Emerson Phelps.
   Banca Commerciale, based in Milan, is Italy's second-largest
bank with assets of $60 billion. Irving's assets total $24.3
billion.
   The tender offer begins Tuesday and is conditioned upon a
minimum of 6.25 million shares being tendered and various
regulatory approvals.
   The special dividends would be paid from asset sales, including
sale of Irving's 50-story Wall Street headquarters. Irving said it
also plans to sell its 39 percent equity interest in Banca della
Svizzera Italiana for about $325 million.
   Today's announcement comes just four days after Bank of New
York's shareholders voted to support management's $1 billion-plus
hostile bid for Irving. The tender offer, which began last month,
is for $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common shares for each of
Irving's roughly 18.1 million common shares outstanding.
   Bank of New York, which holds as a 4.9 percent stake in Irving,
is also running a slate of 16 nominees for Irving's board of
directors. Irving's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled for
Thursday.
   Irving has repeatedly spurned the company's takeover offers,
which began about seven months ago. It maintained it wanted to
remain independent but disclosed that it was seeking a ``white
knight'' friendly merger partner.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said his company had no
immediate comment on Irving's announcement. ``We're studying the
announcement this morning,'' he said..
   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving shares
rose 12.5 cents to $61.50, while Bank of New York gained 37.5 cents
to $31.
   In a statement, Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice, said, ``our
shareholders will benefit far more from the affiliation with BCI
(Banca Commerciale Italiana) than the proposal advanced from BNY.''
   Phelps said Irving's current management is expected to remain in
place. He said a five-member executive committee comprised of
Irving's chairman and president, two Banca Commerciale
representatives and an outside Irving director will oversee the
restructing plan.
   Irving also said it was beginning ``an intensive program of cost
savings'' that is expected to raise net income to about $1.60 a
share in 1988 and $2.75 next year.
   In addition, the banking concern said it would also would
immediately increase Irving's annual common dividend from $2.42 a
share to $4.50.

   The remains of St. Celestine V, a pope
who resigned in 1294 after a five-month papacy, were stolen
overnight from this city's cathedral, authorities said Monday.
   Mayor Enzo Lombardi and other city officials said they presumed
the remains were taken by thieves who expected a ransom, although
no demand had been received.
   Thieves took away the mummified remains of the pope after
forcing open a chapel door and a silver urns in the Cathedral of
Santa Maria di Collemaggio.
   Police said thieves possibly used pass keys for entering the
cathedral through a secondary door.
   Celestine died in 1296, two years after his resignation.

Japanese helicopters, the Maritime Safety Agency reported.
   An agency official said the 11 South Korean and three Filipino
crew members of the Sandakan were picked up by agency and
Self-Defense Marine Force helicopters while drifting in two life
boats about 125 miles north of Naha, Okinawa. All were said to be

   He said the Sandakan, owned by Santiago LNG S.A. of Panama, was
heading for Okayama, western Japan, from China when the vessel sank.

   Yuri Egorov, a Soviet-born pianist
who defected to the Netherlands in 1977, has died of meningitis at
the age of 33.
   Egorov, who died Saturday at his home, complained of a lack of
artistic freedom in the Soviet Union and went into hiding during an

<HEAD>President of Venda, Smallest Homeland, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Mphephu, the
authoritarian president-for-life of the tiny black homeland of
Venda, died Monday at the age of 63.
   Mphephu, Venda's first and only president, died at a Pretoria
hospital of ``multiple organ failure,'' the South African Foreign
Affairs Department said.
   Finance Minister Frank Ravele was named acting president.
   South Africa's white rulers considered Mphephu a valuable and
cooperative ally, but black activists condemned him for repressing
dissent in Venda, the smallest and least viable of South Africa's
four nominally independent tribal homelands.
   No foreign country has recognized Venda since it was declared a
republic in 1979. It has about 500,000 residents, many of them
migrant laborers who work far from the territory, and occupies
about 2,500 square miles in the northeast corner of South Africa.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. Botha, described
Mphephu as ``loyal friend of South Africa who believed in
cooperation rather than confrontation and took a firm stand against
terrorism.''
   Anti-apartheid leaders and human rights groups have
characterized Venda authorities as ruthless in suppressing
political dissent.
   One prominent target of Mphephu's regime was the Rev. Tshenuweni
Farisani, senior official of the Evangelical Luthern Church in
Venda. He has been detained four times and says he was tortured
during three of the detentions.
   Mphephu, who had only a primary school education, headed a
one-party state with strong backing from traditional chiefs and
headmen of clans.
   In the 1970s, Mphephu's party lost elections but retained power
by jailing its rivals. He became the territory's paramount leader
in 1950.

   Pope John Paul II met with Lithuanian
bishops Monday and appealed to Soviet authorities to allow Roman
Catholics in Lithuania to profess their faith without
discrimination.
   The pope recalled last year's celebration of 600 years of
Christianity in Lithuania, but also noted what he called ``the
profound hardships'' still suffered by the Lithuanian church.
   He said those problems include the difficulties in carrying out
its pastoral mission without legal recognition and wif priests and bishops.
   Vatican statistics indicate there are nearly 2 million Catholics
in Lithuania, but th a shortage
oonly 575 priests for 543 parishes.
   John Paul, in remarks addressed to Soviet authorities, said ``it
is dutiful to ask that they don't frustrate the hopes of the
brothers and sisters who in Lithuania, as in other regions,
sincerely profess their own religious faith.''
   He praised Lithuanian Catholics for the practice of their faith.
   ``Your community,'' he told the bishops, ``along the troubled
road of history six centuries long, has kept esteemed and the
inestimatible gift of faith, transmitting it with faithful love
from generation to generation.''

cents from a year earlier.
   Michigan increased its excise tax on Jan. 1, Iowa on March 1,
and several other states have proposed increases this year.
   _The federal excise tax has remained at 16 cents per pack of 20
cigarettes since Jan. 1, 1983, but bills have been introduced in
Congress to boost the rate. Other measures have been introduced
that would disallow tax deductions for tobacco advertising, and ban
all cigarette advertising.
   _A federal law will ban all smoking on U.S. airline flights

The ban is scheduled to expire in two years. Canada imposed a
similar ban in December, and California prohibits smoking on

   A trade association, U.S. Wheat Associates
Inc., has helped launch an olympian effort in South Korea to
promote high-quality bread and other bakery products.
   The beginning of the yearlong promotion will coincide with the
1988 summer Olympic Games in Seoul and will have ``International
Baking Festival'' as its theme.
   A recent statement issued by the U.S. Wheat office here said the
South Korean Bakers Association, with the support of the country's
ministry of health and social affairs, has selected a thousand
bakeries from 3,400 of its members to introduce and promote the
special line of products.
   U.S. wheat officials said the program was organized ``in the
belief that cooperative ventures in foreign countries can expand
markets in the face of stiff competition from other exporting
nations.''
   Ten major South Korean cities were selected as sites for bakery
fairs to display products for consumers and the news media.
   Also, in-store bakery promotions through the 1,000 selected
bakeries will aim at a sales target of $30 million to $50 million
over the yearlong campaign, the association said.

<HEAD>Radio Report Says Higgins Killed By Captors</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New 7th graf ``At U.N. headquarters...'', spokeswoman says
UNIFIL has found no confirmation of radio report. </NOTE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian-controlled radio station
reported today that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins has
been killed by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors.
   The Voice of Lebanon said Higgins was ``killed and buried by his
captors'' early this month in Siddiqine, a village in south Lebanon.
   The Beirut-based Voice of Lebanon has a record of frequent
inaccuracies concerning the foreign hostages in Lebanon. Its report
on Higgins could not be independently verified.
   Timur Goksel, the spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in south
Lebanon with which Higgins was serving when he was abducted, said
of the report: ``We can neither confirm nor deny the report or
anything related to it.''
   He spoke by telephone from the U.N. group's headquarters in
Naqoura on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
   ``We have no such information, and therefore we cannot comment
on the radio report,'' Goksel added. ``We have checked with our
sources, and everybody was surprised when they heard about the
report.''
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Nadia Younes later
told reporters that UNIFIL had checked with its sources and found
no confirmation of the radio report.
   The radio said Higgins was killed hours before pro-Syrian
militiamen of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia captured
Siddiqine from Hezbollah supporters, apparently to keep Amal from
claiming credit for his liberation.
   Amal and Hezbollah spokesmen in Beirut made no comment on the
report. The two groups have been at odds since Higgins, 43, of
Danville, Ky., was kidnapped near the southern port of Tyre on Feb.
17.
   Siddiqine, 10 miles southeast of Tyre, was a Hezbollah
stronghold before Amal crushed its Shiite Moslem fundamentalist
rivals in a four-day crackdown early this month.
   Amal supports the presence of the U.N. peace-keeping force in
predominantly Shiite south Lebanon. Hezbollah, or the Party of God,
opposes it.
   Amal has charged that Hezbollah masterminded Higgins' abduction
to undermine Amal's control of south Lebanon.
   Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian extremist group that is believed to
be an umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 foreign hostages
in Lebanon. Hezbollah has not claimed to hold any foreign hostages.
   Higgins' abduction was claimed by a group calling itself the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which charged that he was a
CIA spy. Both the U.S. and U.N. have denied the charge.
   Amal spokesmen had said their fighters found no trace of Higgins
in any of the Hezbollah strongholds they have captured, including
Siddiqine.
   The foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon are
nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, one Irishman, one
Italian, one West German, one Indian, and two unidentified men.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   A man who had chained himself to an
Outer Banks bridge and demanded that it be saved from erosion today
gave up his three-day vigil along with his run for a state Senate
seat.
   Standing at the bridge catwalk which he had made his soapbox,
Dan Lawrence announced he was ending his protest and throwing his
support to his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Marc Basnight.
   ``I don't want even one person to feel that this was done as a
political stunt, detracting from the great need we have to save
this bridge and save this island,'' Lawrence, a Republican, said
late this morning.
   Lawrence made the announcement after saying earlier today that
he had asked for police protection for his vigil at the
two-mile-long Herbert Bonner Bridge, the only route from Hatteras
Island to the mainland. He also admitted that he had abandoned his
post and gone home for two hours Sunday night.
   ``I was afraid that something stupid was going to happen and I
didn't want to be involved in that,'' Lawrence said. ``I have to
consider my family. I have to consider my own health.''
   Lawrence told Greg Clark, a reporter for radio station WOBR,
that two men drove up to his position on the catwalk and said, ``If
you're here tomorrow, we're going to kill you.''
   Lawrence said he went home Sunday night for two hours, then
returned and spent part of the night in his car at the south side
of the bridge before going to sleep under some trees in Hatteras
Island Park.
   He said his wife had been harassed at the trailer park where
they live, and that his son was suffering emotionally from his
father's vigil.
   ``I need some people out here at night to protect me from the
kook element. There are some kooks out here,'' Lawrence said,
adding that he had been urged by a local high school teacher to
abandon his protest.
   Lawrence admitted the protest was tougher than he had envisioned.
   ``It's easy to say you're going to do something. But I wasn't
ready to face the elements,'' he said.
   Lawrence's protest had drawn praise from Basnight, who joined
Lawrence on the bridge for the announcement that the vigil was over.
   ``I commend him for his efort to try to bring attention to an
injustice,'' Basnight said Sunday. ``Nothing else seems to work.
Maybe something can happen here good.''
   Lawrence, 42, first chained himself to the bridge Friday morning
after the structure was threatened by heavy erosion from a fierce
storm Wednesday.
   Gov. Jim Martin and many local officials and fishermen say
jetties are needed to stabilize the inlet's shifting sands.
   The project was authorized by Congress 17 years ago but the
jetties were never built, mostly due to opposition from
environmentalists and the U.S. Department of the Interior, which
say they wouldn't work and would be environmentally hazardous.
   Hatteras Island, which has about 4,800 year-round residents, is
about 50 miles long and never more than a few miles wide. There has
also been controversy over how and whether to move the historic
Cape Hatteras lighthouse, which has also been threatened by the
ever-encroaching sea.
   When asked if he thought Lawrence's protest would spur officials
to stabilize the Oregon Inlet and the bridge, Basnight said,
``Nobody can answer that, except for the federal officials. We'll
just have to wait and see.''

   Jesse Jackson, campaigning one day before the big New York
primary, said today that early morning fighting with Iran raised
new questions about U.S. policy and that weapons used against
American troops were ``no doubt sold Iran illegally by the
Reagan-Bush administration.''
   Rival Democratic candidate Albert Gore Jr. and Vice President
George Bush, the likely Republican nominee, both called the U.S.
action appropriate, while Democrat Michael Dukakis said it would be
inappropriate for him to comment without more information.
   Jackson also said the fighting could revive questions about how
much President Reagan and Bush knew about secret arms dealing in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The comments came on the eve of Tuesday's primary election, with
255 delegates at stake. Polls have shown Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis
leading in New York, with Jackson second and Sen. Gore of Tennessee
a distant third.
   All three men were campaigning in the state today as reports
provided details of military action in which the U.S. Navy
destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms, sank a defending
Iranian patrol boat and bombed an Iraniants who said they were certain
to vote Tuesday and had a
margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
   Dukakis and Gore marched Sunday in a ``Salute to Israel''
parade, while Jackson held a meeting with community leaders that
was set up by a prominent Jewish supporter. An estimated 25 percent
of New York Democrats are Jewish, and issues concerning Israel have
loomed large in the primary campaign.
   Dukakis heads into the New York contest with a fresh victory to
his credit, in Arizona's weekend caucuses. He bested Jackson by a
3-2 margin in the Saturday contest, picking up 22 delegates to
Jackson's 14. Gore got none.
   The Massachusetts governor has pulled well ahead of Jackson in
the national delegate race, with 872.15 to Jackson's 738.1. Gore
has 417.55. To nominate, 2,082 delegates are needed.
   On the Republican side, Bush has a virtual lock on his party's
nomination, but he was campaigning anyway in Ohio today, with a
trip to Pennsylvania scheduled Tuesday. He is likely to clinch the
1,139 delegates needed to nominate within the next few weeks.
   Jackson and Dukakis are certain to continue their battle in the
coming contests, but Gore's weekend defeat in Arizona brought new
predictions from the other camps that he'll have to pack it in soon.
   Meanwhile, Democrats in Delaware were holding caucuses tonight
in state representative districts. They were choosing 189 delegates
to the state convention on May 23, where 15 national convention
delegates will be chosen.

<TEXT>
   American industry operated at 82.3 percent of
capacity in March, the second consecutive monthly decline, the
government reported today.
   The Federal Reserve Board said that U.S. factories, mines and
utilities saw their operating rate drop by 0.1 percentage point
from February.
   It was the second monthly decline following a 0.2 percent point
dip in February to an operating rate of 82.4 percent, down from
82.6 percent in January.
   Analysts said the setbacks had been expected, given the fact
that certain factories, in particular the auto industry, cut back
on production during the first three months of the year in order to
reduce high backlogs of unsold goods.
   The operating rate for manufacturing plants edged down to 82.5
percent in March, compared to 82.6 percent in February. Production
of durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose
slightly to 80.2 percent of capacity, up 0.1 percentage point from
February, while production of non-durable goods dipped 0.3
percentage point to 85.9 percent of capacity.
   The mining industry, which includes oil and gas drilling, saw
capacity climb to 80.3 percent last month, up from 79.8 percent in
February, while production at electric and gas utilities edged down
0.1 percent to 81.8 percent.
   The various changes left the overall operating rate up 0.6
percentage point from a year ago, reflecting the fact that American
industry has benefited from strong demand for exports over the last
year.

   The army restricted travel in the occupied
territories today and clamped a curfew on about 20 refugee camps in
an effort to quell violence set off by the assassination of a
senior PLO commander.
   Soldiers shot to death an Arab woman and wounded another
Palestinian during protests today in the Gaza Strip, hospital
officials said.
   A new wave of violence was unleashed by the assassination
Saturday of PLO leader Khalil al-Wazir. Israeli sources said the
attack in a Tunis suburb was carried out by the Israeli Mossad
intelligence service, the navy and an elite commando unit.
   Official sources in Tunis said today a Tunisian inquiry into
al-Wazir's killing has concluded the operation was conducted by
Israel. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Al-Wazir, 52, also called Abu Jihad, was the most senior
Palestine Liberation Organization official assassinated since
Fatah, the largest guerrilla group in the PLO, was founded in 1964.
He was PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's closest aide and supervised
military operations inside the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Senior PLO officials in Jordan said today that al-Wazir's
funeral would take place in Syria _ not in Jordan as originally
announced. Al-Wazir's 80-year-old father, Ibrahim, said his son's
body will arrive in Damascus early Tuesday and the funeral would be
that night at the Yarmouk refugee camp on the outskirts of the
capital.
   In the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir grew up, a 30-year-old
Palestinian woman, Aidah Othman Totah, died today after being shot
in the back, officials at Gaza's Ahli Arab Hospital said. Her
relatives told hospital officials she was shot after refusing to
remove burning tires and stones from a street in central Gaza City.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Hospital officials also said Mohammed Ateyah Ghaban, 21, was
shot and wounded in his left leg as he and other youths set tires
ablaze, a common form of protest against 21 years of Israeli
occupation.
   However, the territories remained quieter than on Saturday, when
17 Palestinians died in the bloodiest day of rioting in 4{ months
of unrest.
   Arab reports said Israeli troops shot and wounded nine
Palestinians Sunday. The army confirmed two wounded.
   Journalists and non-residents were barred from major roadways
and towns after the army declared them closed military areas, an
army spokeswoman said. A curfew began Sunday and continued today
for about 400,000 Palestinians living in towns and refugee camps in
the occupied lands.
   The army spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
about 15 of the 19 refugee camps in the West Bank were under
curfew, requiring residents to stay indoors indefinitely. Also
under curfew was the town of Anabta and Nablus, the large city in
the West Bank with 120,000 residents.
   In the Gaza Strip, an Arab journalist said six of eight refugee
camps and one village were under curfew. Burning tires dotted
streets in Gaza City, and most people stayed inside, honoring a PLO
call for three days of mourning for al-Wazir.
   Graffiti on a wall in Gaza City said: ``Revenge on the Mossad
for killing Abu Jihad,'' the code name of al-Wazir.
   In the West Bank camp of Jelazoun, Israeli soldiers turned back
a U.N. convoy carrying food and other supplies on Sunday, despite
complaints of severe shortages during a 33-day curfew. An Israeli
soldier guarding the camp told U.N. officials their convoy posed a
security threat.
   At least 166 Palestinians have been killed since the Palestinian
uprising began Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli settler
also have been slain.
   Palestinian leaders declared three days of mourning beginning
Saturday for al-Wazir. Black flags and green, red, black and white
Palestinian flags fluttered over the roofs of houses throughout the
occupied lands on Sunday.
   On Sunday, most of the 100,000 Palestinians working in Israel
stayed away from their jobs, merchants kept their stores shuttered
and drivers attached black ribbons to the antennas of their cars.
   Thousands of Palestinians filed into mosques to usher in the
holy Moslem month of Ramadan and attend memorial services for the
slain commander.
   The Palestinians blamed Israel for the assassination.
   ``All the people in the occupied areas and outside ... are
extremely shocked by the assassination,'' said Faiz Abu Rahmeh,
al-Wazir's cousin and a leader of the Gaza Strip's 650,000
Palestinians.
   Several army officers and Israelis who were victims of guerrilla
attacks planned by al-Wazir said they were pleased the Palestinian
commander was dead.
   ``Something great has happened, I have closed a circle and I'm
happy,'' the daily Hadashot quoted Eli Ben Yair as saying. Ben
Yair's wife was one of three people killed after Fatah guerrillas
hijacked a bus near Beersheva on March 7.
   Israeli leaders refused to comment on the assassination. Israel
radio quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as telling Cabinet
ministers he heard about the attack on the radio.
   But sources confirmed it was an Israeli operation, carried out
jointly by the Mossad, the navy and an elite commando unit. They
said it had been postponed several times before Saturday.

   Cooler temperatures were helping
today as firefighters from four states battle blazes that have
burned over 12,000 acres of forest and grassland, officials said.
   The largest fire, at Lost River near Warroad, was 80 percent
contained this morning, according to Jean Bergerson at the state
Department of Natural Resources information office here.
   ``Everything is in various stages of mop-up and cleanup today,''
she said.
   Firefighters from Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire arrived
Sunday and will be helping Minnesota firefighters, she said.
   About 200 fires, many of them small, had broken out over the
weekend across northern Minnesota, but Bergerson said there were no
major new fires this morning.
   ``We expect cool weather to hold for the next couple of days,
but there's still no rain so the fire danger will remain high,''
said support dispatcher John Olson at the Northern Fire Center here
late Sunday night.
   Eighty U.S. Forest Service firefighters from Wisconsin and
Michigan arrived in Duluth on Sunday and were dispatched to fire
zones, said Thomas Kroll at the Fire Center.
   A crew from White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire
arrived late Sunday night, Olson said.
   The Lost River fire, which began Saturday, has consumed 7,100
acres.
   ``It's burning in lowland bog, so there's not too much potential
damage,'' Kroll said. ``There's some farms that could be threatened
if the fire burned quite a bit longer, so we're taking action on it
now.''
   A picnic area at the Huntersville State Forest in Wadena County
was destroyed by a fire that burned 570 acres. The fire, which was
contained Saturday night, burned outhouses, tables and trees in the
picnic area, he said.
   No other buildings were destroyed, but Kroll said there were
some close calls.
   A fire near Brainerd came within feet of one home, and three
homes in the Rutledge area had to be evacuated, but firefighters
stopped all the fires before they got to the buildings, he said.
   Kroll said fires burned 10,000 acres of Forest Service property
Saturday, and over 2,000 acres on farm property.

   A Tunisian inquiry into the assassination

was conducted by Israel, official sources said today.
   Tunisia intends to register a formal complaint against the
Jewish state with the United Nations Security Council, the sources
said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 52-year-old al-Wazir, best known as Abu Jihad, was shot to
death at his suburban Tunis home early Saturday by a seven-person
commando unit.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization immediately blamed
Israel's secret service, Mossad, for the attack.
   Israeli leaders have refused to comment on the assassination.
   Al-Wazir's killing set off rioting in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip in which 17 Palestinians died.
   President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, who ordered the
investigation, has asked his foreign minister to inform the
Security Council.
   The investigation revealed that an Israeli military plane was
about 34 miles outside Tunisian air space at the moment of the
attack, according to the sources.
   Other elements implicating Israel were not immediately disclosed.
   In October 1985, Israel raided the PLO headquarters in Tunis,
killing about 80 Palestinians and 20 Tunisians and injuring 100
other people. PLO chief Yasser Arafat arrived about 30 minutes
after that attack.
   Al-Wazir is to be buried in Damascus, Syria. The body was
scheduled to be flown there Tuesday.
   On Sunday, Arafat said the assassination was ``an Israeli
decision taken at the highest level of the leadership with the
greenlight of the American administration, Israel's strategic
ally,'' the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
   In a message to the Palestinian people inside the
Israeli-occupied territories, Arafat paid homage to al-Wazir saying
he ``fell, weapon in his hand, to the bullets of a Mossad (Israeli
secret service) gang.''
   ``To those who thought that the murder of Abu Jihad would snuff
out the uprising of the Palestinian people and reduce its heroic
revolution to nothing, I say that they are dreaming because his
death will stamp a vigorous new breath on this revolution and the
price of his death will be high,'' WAFA quoted Arafat as saying.

   Congressional leaders said today that
President Reagan was fully justified in retaliating against an
Iranian mine attack that seriously damaged a U.S. frigate on patrol
in international waters.
   They said also they are pleased that the president consulted
with them before ordering that two Iranian platforms in the Persian
Gulf be destroyed, rather than merely informing them after the fact.
   ``The mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the
Iranians and sown in the waters by the Iranians,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``The Iranians were
carrying out terrorist acts ... I support the decision to destroy
the (Iranian oil drilling) platforms.''
   Said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas:
   ``In my view, now is the time to send only one message to our
adversaries: That the United States, the president, the Congress,
the people are united and determined to meet our responsibilities
and defend our interests in the gulf. I hope the ayatollah
(Khomeini) gets that message so we can all avoid further bloodshed
and violence,'' Dole said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said the White House
discussions were ``very frank'' and that the congressional leaders
pointed out the perils as well as the possible benefits of military
action.
   But Wright said said of Reagan: ``He is the commander in chief
and when action is taken by the United States, it certainly
behooves all of us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a
nation that is united.''
   Byrd also said that Reagan had promised to report to Congress in
writing within 48 hours on his actions, ``consistent with the War
Powers Act.''
   And he said that, ``for the first time, we were consulted before
the executive order was issued and before it was decided _ and that
was good.''
   Byrd, Dole and three other members of the congressional
leadership were called to the White House Sunday night and briefed
on possible actions that might be taken for the mine attack that
seriously damaged the USS Samuel B. Roberts last week.
   The others were House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.;
and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
   Foley, interviewed on the ``CBS Morning News,'' called the
president's action ``an inevitable consequence of the decision to
reflag Kuwaiti vessels and to provide escorts. I think the
president has a responsibility, obviously, to insure that American
lives and American assets are protected.
   ``The resumption of mining by the Iranian forces has created a
very serious risk, not only to American shipping but to other
neutral shipping and non-belligerent shipping in the area,'' Foley
said.
   He said Reagan intended his move as ``a single action, a
response, and a deterrent to further action.''
   Foley added that because of the volatility of the Middle East,
the White House ``really needs to walk a fine line in terms of
keeping hostilities at a minimum.''

   The chancellor of the University of
Massachusetts lashed back today at U.S. Education Secretary William
Bennett for his criticism of the way the school handled a protest
by minority students.
   ``Students here were treated with respect but also firmness,''
Chancellor Joseph Duffey said. ``They left the building because
they were treated with respect, not because they got what they
wanted. They also left because they realized they were here to
study.''
   Minority students took over a campus building at UMass for six
days in February to protest campus racism, and Bennett, in a Sunday
speech in New Orleans, said the school was too lenient.
   He accused administrators of sending ``the demonstrators a
basket of fruit and ordered out Chinese food for them and then gave
in to all of their demands ... one wonders what kind of teaching
experience that is.''
   The protestors should have been arrested for trespassing, he
said.
   ``Mr. Bennett seems to believe the only response to protesters
with legitimate concerns is to arrest them,'' Duffy said today.
``The only excuse I can imagine for that is that he's been away
from the campus too long.''
   Duffey had sent the protesters a basket of fruit after receiving
a card from them relaying their condolences because his brother was
hospitalized. Duffey later negotiated a settlement with the
students.
   In his speech to the Education Writers Association convention,
Bennett also criticized the University of Minnesota, which recently
decided to turn away former U.N. Ambadassor Jeane Kirkpatrick, and
Yale University, which canceled a date with former U.S. Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.
   In both instances, he said, students had objected to the
conservative speakers.
   ``Universities have become increasingly closed and increasingly
insular and in some cases repressive'' by not allowing certain
speakers onto the campuses, Bennett said. He said most of the
intolerance is for conservative ideas.
   He urged administrators to take a hard line to insure that
universities are open. ``Administrators should not just sit there
and be ambushed,'' Bennett said.
   Students who heckle, shout or otherwise interfere with a
speaker's address should be removed, he said.
   ``They have got to make sure a situation is such that a person
can speak,'' Bennett said.
   Duffey said he agreed with Bennett about keeping campuses open
to controversial speakers.

   Haruo Shikanai, the chairman of the Fuji Sankei
Communications Group, had died of liver and kidney failure at the
age of 42.
   About 5,000 people, including Prime Minister Noboro Takeshita,
attended Monday funeral services for Shikanai, who died Saturday.
   His father, Nobutaka Shikanai, 76, senior adviser to the Fuji
group, assumed the chairman's post he left to his son in 1985,
group spokesman Haruhisa Yoshino said.
   Among the holdings of Fuji Sankei Communications are Sankei
Shimbun, a nationally circulated daily newspaper; Nippon
Broadcasting Corp, a radio station; Fuji Television Network Inc.;
and 103 smaller companies including publishing houses and
production studios. The conglomerate was established in 1968.
   After studying at Boston University, Shikanai joined Nippon
Broadcasting in 1970 and became vice president of the radio company
and managing director of Sankei Shimbun in 1977, Yoshino said.
   He took over the presidency of Fuji Television three years later
at age 35, and was assigned to serve as the group's chairman. In
1985, he succeeded his father as president of Sankei Shimbun and
Nippon Broadcasting.
   Shikanai introduced color printing for Sankei Shimbun, Japan's
fifth-largest daily with a daily circulation of 2.06 million.
   He is survived by his wife, Mitsuko, and four children.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   UNWED FATHERS
   
   The court agreed to study the rights of unwed fathers whose
children are put up for adoption by their mothers.
   The issue is whether unwed fathers who actively seek custody of
their children may be stripped of all parental rights if adoption
is deemed to be in the children's best interest.
   The case is McNamara vs. San Diego County, 87-5840.
   
   POLITICAL PARTIES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may bar political

express themselves and associate with whom they please.
   The case is March Fong Eu vs. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Committee, 87-1269.
   
   AIDS SUIT
   
   The court refused to let a Dallas blood bank withhold the names
and medical records of its donors from a woman who says her husband
contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that donors'
privacy rights do not override Patty Jo Baker's need to find out
their identities for her wrongful-death lawsuit.
   The case is Wadley Research Institute and Blood Bank vs.
Houston, 87-1438.
   
   NATURAL GAS

87-976; Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. vs. FERC, 87-977; Shell
Offshore Inc. vs. Associated Gas Distributors, 87-978; Willcox,
Ariz., vs. FERC, 87-979; and Southern California Gas Co. vs. FERC,
87-1091.
   
   HASTINGS
   
   The court rejected an appeal by U.S. District Judge Alcee
Hastings, who says he unlawfully is being subjected to possible
impeachment.
   The court, without comment, left intact a 1980 law under which
fellow judges asked the House of Representatives to consider
impeaching Hastings for alleged judicial misconduct.
   The cases are Hastings vs. U.S. Judicial Conference, 87-1187,
and Hastings vs. House dJudiciary Committee, A-788.
   
   COSMETICS
   
   The court refused to let the government approve the use in
cosmetics of color additives that pose a minimal risk of causing
cancer.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the cosmetics
industry that safe substances are being forced off the market.
   The case is Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association vs.
Public Citizen, 87-1194.
   
   UNION DUES
   
   The court let stand a ruling that a worker may not be fired for
refusing on religious grounds to pay union dues.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a machinists
union in Seattle seeking to force a Boeing Co. employee to pay
union dues.
   The case is International Association of Machinists vs. Boeing,
87-1484.
   
   FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
   
   The court said it will decide whether public criminal records
compiled by the FBI generally must be released under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   The justices agreed to study a Reagan administration attempt to
scuttle an FOIA lawsuit by a CBS News reporter and the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press aimed at obtaining such
documents.
   The case is U.S. Department of Justice vs. Reporters Committee,
87-1379.
   
   SCIENTOLOGY
   
   The court agreed to decide whether payments, called ``fixed
donations'', made to the Church of Scientology by its members may
be claimed as federal income tax deductions.
   The court's decision, expected sometime next year, will resolve
conflicting rulings by federal appeals courts.
   The case is Hernandez vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
87-963.
   
   FALKLANDS
   
   The court, in a case stemming from the 1982 war over the
Falkland Islands, agreed to decide whether Argentina may be sued in
U.S. courts for attacking a neutral oil tanker.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by Argentine
officials, supported by the Reagan administration, aimed at killing
the lawsuit.
   At issue is whether a foreign nation accused of violating
international law may be sued in federal courts in this country by
a foreign corporation engaged in U.S. trade.
   The case is Argentine Republic vs. Amerada Hess, 87-1372.

   Americans say they exercise an average of 8.7
hours a week, but a majority believe they don't exercise enough,
according to results of a nationwide poll released Monday.
   The poll, conducted for Parents Magazine, also found that 47
percent of Americans are satisfied with their weight, 46 percent
said they are overweight and 6 percent said they are too thin.
   Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they don't exercise
enough; 43 percent said they do.
   The most popular exercise, reported by 64 percent of the people
who said they exercise, was walking rapidly. Forty-six percent said
they follow some exercise program of their own, 44 percent ride a
bicycle, 39 percent swim, and 32 percent play a sport.
   Those who live in families were split down the middle on the
question of whether they exercise together or alone. Walking or
hiking was the most popular pastime for the togetherness group.
   Seventy-seven percent of the parents surveyed said their
children exercise enough, and 78 percent said they encourage their
children to exercise. Team sports are the most popular juvenile
form of exercise, the poll found.
   The magazine said its polling firm, Kane, Parsons & Associates,
surveyed 1,006 adults selected at random by telephone. The poll's
margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest who urged parishioners to
turn in their handguns and sign pledges to fight violence says he
will invite other parishes to join his campaign.
   The Rev. Marshall Gourley, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe
Church, collected six handguns, two rifles and nearly 400 pledges
Sunday at his church in west Denver.
   The weapons were turned over to Police Chief Ari Zavaras, and
the pledge cards to Mayor Federico Pena. Gourley has asked police
to destroy the weapons.
   Gourley asked his parishioners to give up their guns after he
presided at the funerals of two people who died violently. One was
killed by police and the other killed himself.
   After Sunday's services, Gourley said the problem of guns and
violence goes beyond his parish, adding: ``What we do here is
almost insignificant.''
   Besides enlisting the support of other Denver parishes, Gourley
also called on ``all people of good will in the metro area'' to
discard their weapons because ``there are simply too many guns.''
   ``I fully support him,'' Zavaras said. ``I have strong feelings
about gun control and the unlawful carrying of weapons.''
   Pena, who regularly attends Our Lady of Guadalupe, thanked the
parishioners who supported the program Sunday.

<TEXT>
   The Mingo County sheriff resigned today
as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors on counts
alleging that he bought the job in 1982 for $100,000, officials
said.
   Mingo County Commissioner Steve Adkins said the commission
received a letter from Mingo County Sheriff Charles ``Eddie''
Hilbert stating that he had resigned effective at 12:01 a.m. today.
   Hilbert, 45, of Delbarton, was in Huntington today to enter a
plea before U.S. District Judge Charles E. Haden II.
   He was indicted in January on 13 felony counts alleging he
bought the sheriff's office in 1982 and used it to assist relatives
and business associates in illegal activities.
   As part of a plea agreement with the federal government, Hilbert
was required to resign as sheriff, according to Joseph Savage,
assistant U.S. attorney.
   Hilbert also has entered into a proposed plea agreement in Mingo
County Circuit Court, where he was charged with a felony count of
bribery in connection with the sale of the sheriff's job.
   Adkins said he expects the commission to name Jim Webb of
Kermit, a former Mingo County highway supervisor, as the new
sheriff on Tuesday.
   Hilbert is one of nearly 50 public officials or employees in
southern West Virginia who have been charged or convicted in
connection with state and federal investigations of political
corruptin or drug trafficking.
   Later today, former sheriff Johnie Owens _ who sold the office
to Hilbert in 1982 _ was scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. District
Court in Huntington on three counts of tax evasion and one count of
bribery in connection with the sale. He will be sentenced Tuesday
on a state charge of tax evasion in connection with the case.

   A church congregation made good on a
challenge to boost attendance, so their minister fulfilled his side
of the bargain and raised his voice from the roof.
   With an eye on gathering rain clouds, the Rev. John Chadwick
preached his sermon Sunday from the roof of the Forest Lawn Baptist
Church in this Dallas suburb.
   ``I don't think there was any danger,'' Chadwick said.
   The church's 40-odd members met his challenge to boost
attendance to 50 for the April 10 service. When Chadwick became
pastor of the 30-year-old church three years ago, there were eight
members.
   Chadwick, dressed in overalls and a cowboy hat, spoke for about
10 minutes on the roof. Then rain began falling, and the
congregation moved inside.
   The rooftop sermon brought curious neighbors onto their porches.
   ``If you can't get the people in the church to come, just shout
it out where the world can hear it,'' said Ruth Chadwick of her
husband's sermon.

   New York is a city with many landmark buildings
and historic sites, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission is
considering protecting some more _ including an operating stable
and a Pepsi-Cola sign.
   That's right, a stable. As in horses. In Manhattan.
   The stable and sign are among several proposals to be considered
by the commission Tuesday.
   ``There's nothing which says a landmark has to be a building,''
said Joseph Bresnan, executive director of the Landmarks
Preservation Commission.
   The 60-foot neon Pepsi-Cola sign has stood over the firm's
bottling plant in Long Island City since it was erected in 1936.
   ``It's a visible, well-known element on the New York skyline and
we want to learn more about it,'' said commission chairman Gene A.
Norman.
   The stable is the Claremont Riding Academy on Manhattan's upper
West Side. Built in 1892, it was once condemned 25 years ago when
the city sought to tear it down as part of an urban renewal
project. But it's still serving people who ride in Central Park.
   Also on Tuesday's agenda is a 67-year-old lighthouse that stands
along the Hudson River underneath the towering George Washington
Bridge. It's known to generations of children from the story ``The
Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge.''

<HEAD>Pierce Says HUD Serves More With Less Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. said
Monday that ``we are taking care of more people by far, with much
less money'' than when he took office in 1981.
   Pierce defended before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee the
administration's $19 billion spending request for the Department of
Housing and Urban Development for fiscal 1989, up slightly from
current outlays of $18.6 billion.
   The only member of Reagan's original Cabinet who remains in
office, Pierce has presided over a dramatic decline in HUD's
spending authority _ the ceiling for separately approved
appropriations _ from $33.4 billion in 1981 to a proposed $13.6
billion next year.
   The secretary said he did ``more with less'' by getting rid of
big, costly HUD programs of questionable effectiveness and
streamlining others inherited from previous Democratic
administrations.
   He said HUD is assisting 4.3 million needy families this year,
compared with 3.3 million in 1981. Actual outlays over the same
period have slowly increased, from $14 billion to a projected $18.6
billion this year.
   Pierce said he had always based his budgetary decisions on three
guiding principles:
   _``First, individual rights and responsibilities belong to the
poor as much as anyone else.
   _``Second, the poor need not always remain poor, nor should we
assume they will.
   _``Third, the poor often are capable of making their own
decisions and improving their condition in life.''
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., the subcommittee chairman,
questioned the projected costs of a new HUD program of rental
subsidies for poor families that are intended to give recipients
greater freedom to choose where they will live.
   Proxmire said the new system of direct cash vouchers cost more
than $200 million annually above the present certificate system
serving the same number of people.
   Proxmire asked Pierce whether the voucher system was ``a bad
deal for American taxpayers'' in view of the need to reduce federal
budget deficits. Pierce said the long-term differences in costs
should be negligible once the shift to the new system is completed.
   Under the current certificate system, the government pays the
difference between fair market rentals and 30 percent of a poor
family's income available for housing. The voucher system allows a
poor family to pay more or less than the subsidized rent if they
wish.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., asked Pierce and his aides for a
report on why there were so few applicants for a new, $30 million
program to provide temporary housing for the homeless who are
mentally ill. Pierce said the department will begin an analysis
immediately after the next May 17 deadline for applications.

   Iran said today U.S. helicopters attacked
Iranian troops to support an Iraqi offensive that reportedly
recaptured the southern Faw peninsula. U.S. officials denied the
charge.
   The Iranian claim was made hours after American warships
destroyed two Iranian platforms in the Persian Gulf in retaliation
for a mine blast that rocked a U.S. frigate last week.
   Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, dismissed the charge as
totally without foundation. No U.S. military forces have been
involved with Iraqi units, he said.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a Supreme Defense
Council statement as saying: ``In direct, open and practical
support for the Iraqi regime, American forces have entered the
war.''
   The statement was issued after Iraq reported its troops, led by
units of the elite Presidential Guard, recaptured Faw. Iran, which
seized the peninsula two years ago, denied Iraqi had retaken it.
   Iraq said its forces today retook the town of Faw near the tip
of the peninsula. It is the only town on the peninsula.
   ``Victorious Iraqi armed forces entered Faw town today and
hoisted the Iraqi flag,'' the Iraqi News Agency reported in an
urgent dispatch.
   A war communique read over state-run television in Baghdad said
Iranian forces were driven out of the peninsula to the other side
of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   The Supreme Defense Council, which determines Iran's war
strategy, called on all Iranians to join the military and brace for
a ``holy defense'' of their country.
   Tehran Radio said U.S. helicopters attacked Iranian troops in
southern Iraq ``several times'' on Sunday during the Iraqi
offensive.
   There was no immediate reaction to the allegation from
Washington.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said today that during the
U.S. attack on the two oil platforms, Iran patrol boats fired on an
American vessel and a helicopter, but they escaped unscathed.
   U.S. warships sank the patrol boat, Carlucci said.
   Soon after the platform attack, the Iran gunboats fired on a
U.S. tugboat, but it too was not hit. Iranian gunboats also
attacked three facilities in the Mubarak oilfield off Sharjah, an
emirate in the southern gulf.
   Iran also accused Kuwait, the closest Arab state to the war
zone, of aiding the latest Iraqi attack and warned of retaliation.
Kuwait denied the charge.
   Iranian officials, quoted by IRNA, said Kuwait allowed Iraqi
troops to use its Bubiyan Island as a launching board for the
offensive.
   In Washington, the White House said the U.S. Navy attacked the
offshore Sassan and Sirri platforms in retaliation for a mine blast
that damaged the American frigate, Samuel B. Roberts, and wounded
10 crewmen last Thursday.
   Washington said Iran laid the mines in the Persian Gulf. Tehran
has denied the charge.
   Iraqi gunners, meanwhile, today fired four long-range missiles
into Tehran, the holy city of Qom and Isfahan, capital of the
16th-century Persian empire.
   The Iranian agency confirmed the three cities were struck by
missiles, claiming civilian casualties. But it did not give any
figure.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
7th Army Corps and the Presidential Guard, ``destroyed all enemy
forces in the Faw triangle,'' which the Iranians overran in an
offensive in February 1986.
   It said ``small groups'' of Iranian soldiers were entrenched in
a few positions, facing ``death, imminent defeat or captivity.''
   The Iraqi offensive, codenamed ``blessed Ramadan,'' began
Sunday, on the eve of the beginning of Islam's holy month of
fasting.
   It was the first time that Iraq has taken the initiative in the
ground war since mid-1986, when it overran the abandoned Iranian
town of Mehran.
   The Faw peninsula is 50 miles southeast of Iraq's major port
city of Basra. The Iranians had held 120 square miles of the
peninsula for two years. Tehran reportedly has used Faw to launch
anti-ship, Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at Kuwaiti ships and oil
facilities.

   An Israeli court today convicted John Demjanjuk
of Nazi war crimes, ruling the former Ohio autoworker was the
sadistic ``Ivan the Terrible'' who sent hundreds of thousands of
Jews to their deaths in World War II.
   ``We determine decisively and without hesitation or doubt that
the accused John Demjanjuk who is on trial before us, is Ivan,
known as `Ivan the Terrible,' the operator of gas chambers,'' said
presiding Judge Dov Levine.
   The court convicted the 68-year-old Demjanjuk of all four counts
against him: war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, crimes
against humanity and crimes against persecuted people.
   Demjanjuk was absent from the court as the guilty verdict was
read. He listened from an adjoining cell, where he lay on a cot
suffering from what his family said was a back injury.
   He will be sentenced April 25 and could face the death penalty.
Observers have said it was more likely he would receive a life
prison term. Defense attorneys have said they would appeal.
   Demjanjuk was the second person to be convicted of war crimes in
Israel. Adolf Eichmann, architect of Adolf Hitler's ``Final
Solution'' for the extermination of European Jewry, was convicted
and hanged in 1962, the only person to have been executed in
Israel's 40-year history.
   In their lengthy summation, the judges rejected key defense
arguments and said Demjanjuk's testimony was ``filled with
inconsistent versions.''
   Earlier, Israel radio reported Demjanjuk stayed away from
today's court session because his attorney, Yoram Sheftel, told him
he thought he would be convicted.
   Sheftel confirmed to The Associated Press that he told Demjanjuk
three days ago ``there is no doubt in my mind he is going to be
convicted, even though he deserves an acquittal.''
   Of Demjanjuk's inability to sit in the courtroom, Sheftel said:
``I would not exclude the possibility that it was related to
nerves.''
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was charged with war crimes, crimes
against the Jewish people and crimes against humanity for allegedly
operating gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka
death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   Levine indicated during his summation that the judges gave great
weight to the testimony of five survivors who identified Demjanjuk
as ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   The question of identity has been key during the 14-month trial.
Demjanjuk denies he is ``Ivan'' and defense attorneys questioned
the memory of survivors.
   Levine said survivors' testimony had persuaded the court ``these
experiences are deeply ingrained on their memories, the horrors are
a deep part of them, the sights are before their eyes and the
stories are true and accurate.''
   Polish-born Judge Zvi Tal also rejected a defense contention
that ``Ivan'' was killed during a prisoner revolt in August 1943.
   Inconsistences in Demjanjuk's testimony, Tal added, ``lead us
not to believe the version of the accused ... that he spent 18
months (at a prisoner-of-war camp) is totally unsupportable and
implausible.''
   Demjanjuk's wife, Vera, 62, was seen crying and wringing her
hands during the lunch break. ``I can't even sit down,'' she said.
   Demjanjuk, who lived in a Cleveland suburb before being
extradited to Israel in February 1986, claims he is a victim of
mistaken identity. He says he was a Nazi prisoner-of-war during the
period in question.
   The prosecution's case against Demjanjuk has rested largely on
the memories of the five Treblinka survivors.
   A pivotal piece of prosecution evidence was Demjanjuk's alleged
Nazi identity card, provided to Israel by the Soviet Union.
   The document, issued at Trawniki, a training camp for death camp
guards in Nazi-held Poland, does not mention Treblinka but states
that Demjanjuk was posted at the nearby Sobibor death camp.
   Six prosecution experts authenticated the card's paper, ink,
photograph and signatures, and an equal number of defense witnesses
said the document was forged. Demjanjuk claims the Trawniki card
was fabricated by the Soviets to punish him for fighting in an
anti-communist unit organized by the Nazis at the end of World War
II.
   Demjanjuk's attorneys presented 12 statements from Treblinka
inmates who failed to identify Demjanjuk's picture as that of
``Ivan.''
   Besides Mrs. Demjanjuk, the defendant's son John Jr., 22;
son-in-law Ed Nishnic; daughter Lydia Maday, 37; and her husband
Andrij went to Israel to hear the verdict. Another daughter, Irene
Nishnic, 27, and Demjanjuk's 2-year-old grandson, Eddie, remained
in Cleveland.

   The State Department today condemned the
slaying of Khalil al-Wazir, the military chief of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and called again for peace talks between
Israel and the Arabs.
   Al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was gunned down in his home
in Tunis on Saturday along with three of his bodyguards by masked
commandos. No group or country has claimed responsibility. A
Tunisian inquiry concluded today that Israel carried out the
slaying.
   The PLO official had encouraged and supported the Palestinian
uprising on the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza in which 166
Palestinians have died in clashes with Israeli authorities.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said ``I
don't have anything at all on responsibility. We don't know.'' He
said the U.S. government had no knowledge of the commando operation
in the quiet Tunis suburb ``nor was it involved in any way.''
   He condemned `'this act of political assassination'' and said
``violence is not the solution to the problems of the Middle East.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has made three trips to the
region in the past six months to solicit Israeli and Arab support
for negotiations to provide self-rule for the Palestinians and to
address an overall settlement. He has not succeeded.
   Redman said `'we remain committed to pushing ahead with this
peace process. It is important to the region.''
   He said ``this kind of violence is not going to be part of the
solution.''

   Firefighters from three states on
Monday helped battle grass and forest fires, which have consumed
92,300 acres around the state this year, officials said.
   Authorities called last year, when 88,000 acres burned in 900
fires, the worst in a decade, said Jean Bergerson, information
officer with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   This year, 798 fires, beginning around the first of this month,
already have burned 92,300 acres, Bergerson said. The fire season
usually ends about May 1.
   No injuries have been reported, and property damage has been
confined to 10 structures, most of them abandoned or unoccupied,
she said.
   A 7,000-acre grass fire that began near Warroad in northwestern
Minnesota on Saturday was 80 percent contained Monday, Bergerson
said. ``They're having problems with some burning peat on that
one,'' she said.
   Fifty new grass and forest fires, mostly in central Minnesota,
broke out Sunday but burned only 1,200 acres, Bergerson said.
   On Saturday, 200 fires burned 12,000 acres in central and
northern Minnesota, including a 2,000-acre fire near Willmar,
Bergerson said.
   Lower temperatures and some precipitation helped keep down the
new fires Sunday. No new major fires were reported Monday morning.
   Eighty U.S. Forest Service firefighters from Wisconsin, Michigan
and New Hampshire who arrived in Duluth on Sunday will be doing
mostly mop-up on fires that are contained but smouldering, she said.
   ``It's supposed to be a little warmer than yesterday and there's
a possibility of winds picking up this afternoon,'' Bergerson said.
``So, as the day goes on, we're expecting more fires to crop up
again.''

   Here is a text of the remarks President Reagan
made Monday in defending a new wave of American military attacks on
Iranian targets in the Persian Gulf:
   Earlier today, our Navy made a measured response to Iran's
latest use of military force against U.S. ships in international
waters as well as its continued military and terrorist attacks
against a number of non-belligerents.
   Following the destruction of the two Iranian military platforms,
whose personnel evacuated after our warning, several Iran naval
vessels and small boats attempted to engage our ships and aircraft.
Three Iranian naval vessels and at least two small boats were sunk
or very severely damaged.
   We've taken this action to make certain the Iranians have no
illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior. We aim to deter
further Iranian aggression, not provoke it. They must know that we
will protect our ships, and if they threaten us, they'll pay a
price.
   A more normal relationship with Iran is desirable and we're
prepared for it,'' he said. ``But such a relationship is not
possible so long as Iran attacks neutral ships, threatens its
neighbors, supports terrorism and refuses to end the bloody war
with Iraq.

Weapons</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union's acceptance of the
administration view that the superpower arms treaty outlaws
futuristic weapons that could be carried by intermediate-range
missiles resolves the issue, the State Department said today.
   ``It does very clearly resolve this one particular issue,'' said
Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman. ``The Soviet
understanding is the same as ours, which is that the INF treaty
bans all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched cruise and ballistic
missiles in the INF range regardless of the type of weapon it might
be carrying.''
   Redman said the joint conclusion would have no impact on the
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, a program known popularly as
``Star Wars'' that seeks to develop a space-based shield against
Soviet ballistic missiles with futuristic technology.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accepted the U.S.
position in a letter delivered Friday night by Soviet Ambassador
Yuri Dubinin to Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway,
another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Sunday.
   The concession seems to remove concerns that had been raised by
the Senate Armed Services Committee about weaponry using exotic
technologies such as lasers, plasma or ion beams.
   Although the panel has endorsed the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., last
Thursday described the futuristic weapons issue as a possible
``hole in the treaty'' that had to be filled before he would bring
the pact to a vote of the full Senate.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz had raised the issue with
Shevardnadze on Thursday while they were in Geneva for the signing
of an agreement with Pakistan and Afghanistan for the withdrawal of
Soviet forces from Afghanistan and a return of millions of Afghan
refugees to the country after more than eight years of civil war.
   Shultz is scheduled to leave Tuesday for Moscow for talks with
Shevardnadze on a more elaborate treaty to sharply reduce U.S. and
Soviet strategic nuclear weapons and to make preparations for
President Reagan's visit to Moscow for a summit meeting with Soviet
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev on May 29-June 2.
   Shevardnadze's letter appears to represent an effort by Moscow
to dispel congressional suspicions about Soviet intentions to
cooperate with the United States in reducing nuclear weapons.
   The Reagan administration has pushed for a Senate ratification
vote on the INF treaty before the summit, but the Armed Services
panel was planning to issue another report on the futuristic
weapons issue and Byrd said no floor action was likely before that
reported was completed.
   ``I'm not driven by a calendar deadline,'' he said. ``I want
first, last and always to have a good treaty.''
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and former Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency Director Kenneth Adelman had said in
letters released Thursday that they didn't believe the INF treaty
banned futuristic weapons.
   However, other administration officials including chief treaty
negotiator Maynard Glitman have said the Soviet Union understood
that the pact bars the possession or flight testing of all
medium-range weapons no matter how they are armed or operate.
   Ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators, and both
parties say the treaty likely will be supported by 88 to 90
senators.

   President Reagan said today that the American
shelling of two Iranian oil platforms should serve as a warning to
Iran that ``we will protect our ships and, if they threaten us,
they'll pay a price.''
   ``We undertook this action to make sure the Iranians have no
illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior,'' the president
said.
   ``We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke it,''
Reagan said. ``They must know that we will protect our ships, and
if they threaten us, they'll pay a price.''
   Reagan's order sending the fleet into action came after last
week's incident in which the Samuel B. Roberts, a guided missile
frigate, was severely damaged _ and almost sunk _ by a mine that
U.S. officials said had been freshly laid by Iranians. Ten American
sailors were injured.
   His comments came at the start of a previously scheduled speech
in the Old Executive Office Building, next to the White House, to
members of the Associated General Contractors.
   The president said the United States does desire a more normal
relationship with Iran, ``but such a relationship is not possible
so long as Iran attacks neutral ships, threatens its neighbors,
supports terrorism and refuses to end the bloody war with Iraq.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said that the
United States sent a message to Iran today warning that any
``further provocation or hostile Iranian military or terrorist
action against U.S. personnel or targets will receive a firm U.S.
response.''
   The message said the mine explosion that damaged the Roberts had
followed repeated warnings by the United States to Iran about the
consequences of placing mines in international waters of the
Persian Gulf.
   Redman said that before today's retaliatory action, the United
States had notified Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and
Belgium of its intentions. All have naval vessels in the Gulf.
   Others, including the Soviet Union, were notified at the time
the action commenced, Redman said.

   Congressional leaders briefed by the president hours before the
attacks said they agreed with Reagan.
   Hitting back, two Iranian navy frigates fired missiles at U.S.
aircraft, and an Iranian guided missile patrol boat fired on the
cruiser Wainwright, the Pentagon said.
   One frigate was attacked and set afire by U.S. forces; the other
was left dead in the water, the Pentagon said. The patrol boat was
sunk by the U.S. frigate Simpson.
   The Wainwright, one of the American ships that had taken part in
the attack on the platforms, was not hit, said Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci.
   ``The government of Iran should understand that we will protect
our ships and our interests against unprovoked attack,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at a pair of briefings hich
brought reporters scurrying to the White House in the pre-dawn
darkness.
   Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said an American helicopter was also fired upon but not hit.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said an American-flagged
tugboat, the Willi Tide, came under atttack from three Iranian
speedboats. In New Orleans, Victor Koock of the ship's owner,
Tidewater Inc., said he understood the boat and its 12-man crew
were safe and were sailing for port.
   The announcement of the raid was delayed until 3:30 a.m. EDT,
after news was received in Washington that the attacks on the
Iranian oil facilities had started two hours earlier.
   Fitzwater said the president ordered the move ``in response to
Iran's recent resumption of mine laying in international waters and
its mine attack on the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts.''
   That attack, on Thursday, injured 10 American seaman and nearly
sank the Roberts. The mine blew a nine-foot hole in the side of the
guided missile frigate.
   Fitzwater said he had no reports of American or Iranian
casualties resulting from the shelling of the oil platforms.
   The oil platforms at Sirri and Sassan in the southern Gulf was
also used ``as command and control radar stations for the Iranian
military,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said U.S. Marines had boarded the Sassan and
``have set charges for its ultimate destruction.''
   The incident was the second of its nature since the United
States began escorting oil tankers through the gulf on July 21,
1987 to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the
7{-year Iran-Iraq war.
   On Oct. 19, a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack
on a Kuwaiti ship flying the U.S. flag in which 18 Americans were
injured. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what Reagan
termed a ``prudent'' response.
   Fitzwater said the White House had ``conclusive evidence'' Iran
had laid the mine that hit the frigate, and had laid other mines in
the area.
   ``The government of Iran has repeatedly been warned about the
consequences of such hostile acts,'' he said. ``Our actions ... are
designed and intended to deter further Iranian mining.''
   Fitzwater reported that the president decided on the attack
Sunday night during meetings in the private residence of the White
House.
   He said Reagan met with Vice President George Bush, Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci, Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
National Security Adviser Colin Powell, Chief of Staff Howard Baker
and others at 8:30 p.m. EST, then briefed congressional leaders and
met with his advisers for ``fine tuning'' of the decision.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., one of five
congressional leaders who attended the briefing, said he believes
Reagan regards the U.S. retaliation as ``an action that is designed
to be a single action, to be a response and a deterrent to further
action.''
   Foley called the response ``an inevitable consequence of the
decision to reflag Kuwaiti vessels and to provide escorts.... The
resumption of mining by the Iranian forces has created a very
serious risk, not only to ... American shipping but to other
neutral shipping.''
   ``The Iranians were carrying out terrorist acts ... I support
the decision to destroy the platforms,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   ``I hope the ayatollah (Khomeini) gets that message so we can
all avoid further bloodshed and violence,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Fitzwater said he did not know whether Reagan was awake during
the early-morning attack.

   About 20,000 anti-government students
shouted protests and scattered anti-U.S. leaflets on Monday, the
anniversary of a 1960 popular uprising.
   National police, meanwhile, were put on top alert after
President Roh Tae-woo called for severe punishment of political
activists who resort to violence. Roh, worried by clashes between
partisans of rival political parties, said his government would not
``tolerate violent and seditious acts'' in campaigning for National
Assembly elections on April 26.
   The government had mobilized about 35,000 riot police over the
weekend to protect campaign rallies nationwide.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam accused the governing Democratic
Justice Party of using ``gangsters'' to impede opposition rallies.
He said government officials were turning to the autocratic tactics
of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   In the southern city of Suwon on Monday, students hurled tear
gas grenades and firebombs at a governing party office, but there
were no reports of injury.
   The students in Seoul chanted ``Down with dictatorship!'' as
they joined in a 10-mile run from Korea University to a
commemorative cemetery and back, turning the annual event into a
huge anti-government demonstration.
   The annual run commemorates the April 1960 popular uprising that
protested election procedures and helped topple autocratic
President Syngman Rhee.
   Riot police remained on alert along the course but did not
intervene.
   The students' leaflets criticized both the government and the
United States. Anti-U.S. sentiment has grown this year as
Washington pressured South Korea to open its markets.
   After Monday's run, about 5,000 students regrouped at Korea
University for a rally supporting labor rights.
   They called for joint struggle with striking workers, charging
the government with suppressing labor unions and their demands for
a better life.
   The students also shouted ``Yankee go home!'' and called for
removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea. Many Koreans
believe the 40,000 U.S. troops stationed in their country keep
nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Coalition Says Catholic Church Has Unfair Advantage In Abortion
Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church's tax-exempt status
gives it an unfair advantage in the political battle over abortion
rights, the Supreme Court was told Monday.
   The court was urged by a ``pro-choice'' coalition to keep alive
an 8-year-old lawsuit that seeks to strip the church of its tax
exemption because of its anti-abortion lobbying.
   The suit is against the federal government, not the church.
   The justices are being asked to decide whether the suit can go
forward _ not whether the church's tax exemption should be revoked.
A decision is expected to be announced by July.
   If the suit against the government is kept alive, the church
faces $100,000 a day in fines for its refusal to surrender
documents sought by those suing.
   Marshall Beil, a lawyer for pro-choice groups and individuals,
said being free from paying taxes is a form of government subsidy
that ``is skewing the political process'' in the national debate
over abortion.
   Only the courts ``can create a remedy,'' he said. ``The
political process can't.''
   Church officials and the Reagan administration urged the court
to kill the lawsuit.
   Permitting such legal claims could ``expose the government to
untold suits by people interested but not affected by the outcome''
of federal regulation, said Justice Department lawyer Alan I.
Horowitz.
   Several justices hinted that the case could be sent back to a
federal appeals court for clarification of that court's views on
the pro-choice coalition's legal standing to sue the government.
   Justice Byron R. White, in raising that possibility, said, ``It
would save us a lot of work.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist suggested that the case is in
``sort of a twilight zone'' because the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals did not state clearly whether it believed the pro-choice
coalition has the proper legal standing to sue.
   The appeals court said last June that ``there is at least a
colorable basis for standing.''
   The pro-choice coalition said in its suit against the government
that the tax breaks for the church violate a provision of the
federal tax code barring any tax-exempt organization from spending
money on political activities.
   The 2nd Circuit court upheld a ruling by a federal judge in New
York City in 1986 who found the church in civil contempt for
refusing to supply records to those suing the government.
   The judge ordered the church to pay $100,000 a day until it
supplied the documents but the contempt ruling has been put on hold
pending word from the Supreme Court.
   Before reaching the issue of legal standing, the justices must
decide whether the church officials had the right to appeal the
contempt citation.
   The question is whether a witness such as the church _ rather
than one of the opposing sides in a lawsuit _ has such a right of
appeal prior to the outcome of the case.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said that denying such a right of appeal
could lead to imprisonment in some cases for long periods _ not
just a stiff fine _ for a reluctant witness.
   ``You have to spend however many years in jail until the case is
complete?'' he asked Beil.
   The lawyer for the pro-choice coalition noted that the Catholic
church case involved a fine, not a jail term. He added that the
church has an alternate remedy: providing the documents his clients
seek.
   Kevin T. Baine, representing church officials, urged the
justices to deny legal standing to the pro-choice forces.
   Permitting their suit would open the way to a host of legal
challenges against tax exemptions for any religious group that
takes a stand on such issues as civil rights or the death penalty,
he said.
   ``You can substitute any church ... any controversial issue,''
said Baine, who is representing the U.S. Catholic Conference and
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.

   As bidders for lucrative city contracts go,
LeClaire Service Corp. isn't rich, doesn't wield much clout, and
has no friends in high places.
   But LeClaire, owned and operated by public-housing tenants,
wants a chance.
   ``A chance to become a productive, positive part of society, to
share a piece of the American dream,'' said Irene Johnson, the
driving force behind LeClaire Service, which draws its name,
management and workers from LeClaire Courts, a 615-unit housing
project on the South Side.
   LeClaire has a 15 percent stake in a joint venture bidding for
food and beverage concessions at Midway Airport. Heading the
venture is Flying Food Fare Inc., a company that specializes in
catering to the airline industry and is owned by Chicago
real-estate entrepreneur Sue Ling Gin.
   The contract, which would be for five years and likely will be
awarded within the next few weeks, calls for the operation of 22
concession stands at Midway and could generate revenues of $42
million.
   LeClaire Service, which employs five full-time and two part-time
workers, would own and operate three stands, and as the major
subcontracting partner, be responsible for recruiting half the
employees for all the stands.
   ``Obviously, the jobs would be a benefit, but more important,
the money would roll over in the neighborhood,'' said Ms. Gin,
whose Flying Food would own 70 percent of the venture, with the
remaining 15 percent divided among two Hispanic businesses and a
Chinese-American business group.
   The contract could mean $750,000 annually for the fledgling
company and between 40 and 80 new jobs for LeClaire residents, who
number about 3,500.
   Ms. Johnson considers LeClaire Service a success already. It
provides more than 700 meals daily to seven day-care centers and
has gross sales of about $140,000.
   ``All this began with the idea of making something different out
of public housing,'' she said, ``and we're succeeding every day.''
   LeClaire residents, taking a lesson and some counseling from
public-housing activists in St. Louis, Boston and Washington, took
steps six years ago to become Chicago's first tenant-managed
project.
   ``Once we got that in motion, got tenants interested and
involved in their homes, we decided the next step was economic
development,'' said Ms. Johnson. ``Finding jobs and keeping them
here.''
   There is no income ceiling for residents of LeClaire Courts,
where rent is based on 30 percent of income.
   With help and some training funds from the nearby Clarence
Darrow Community Center, LeClaire residents moved into the food
business five years ago.
   Ms. Gin learned about LeClaire Services when the community
center's executive director asked her to come in and share her
business acumen with members of the group.

<HEAD>Watch Lost During WWII Recovered, Ring Found On Lakebed After 19
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A diamond engagement ring is back on its owner's finger 19 years
after it fell in a lake, thanks to some hard work, and a World War
II GI's wristwatch has been returned from France surrounded by
mystery.
   The ring disappeared unnoticed in 1969 while Homerlene Bevan was
playing with her son at Lake Milton outside Youngstown, Ohio. Emma
Bouzek of Prairie du Chien, Wis., has no idea how her brother's
watch was left in France when he returned from the war, or why he
had her married name and hometown inscribed on the back.
   Mrs. Bevan and her husband, Barry, had been able to search for
the ring when Lake Milton receded in 1969 and, more recently, when
the lake was drained for dam repairs.
   ``We were on our hands and knees. We had a little rake for the
mud. Nothing,'' Mrs. Bevan, 47, said last week.
   Mrs. Bevan didn't know exactly where she lost the ring in 1969
because she didn't notice it missing until she got out of the water.
   Bevan decided to give the search one more try April 9 after the
state announced plans to refill the lake. Aided by a friend who had
a new metal detector, Bevan cleared an area about 5 feet from shore.
   ``He (Bevan) went right to the spot, not that anything told him
to, but he went right there,'' she said.
   The metal detector soon alerted them to something.
   ``He (Bevan) just started digging,'' Mrs. Bevan said. ``He dug
and could see a diamond shining, not bright, but the sun kind of
caught it.''
   Mrs. Bevan was not present when the ring was found. Later that
day when she returned home, she said, her husband had his hands in
his pockets and looked shaken.
   She asked him if he was all right and he said, ``Do you believe
in miracles?'' Then he slipped the ring on.
   ``He got tears in his eyes, and so did I,'' she said.
   In Wisconsin, Ms. Bouzek received the wristwatch by mail last
week from a French woman who had written to her in November.
   ``It runs like velvet,'' said Ms. Bouzek, 72. ``It's a Gruen.''
   Ms. Bouzek's brother, John White, was wounded during the
invasion of Normandy in June 1944, and spent some time in a
hospital in France before returning to Prairie du Chien. He later
moved to Milwaukee.
   But he died nearly three years ago at age 66, long before Ms.
Bouzek knew of the watch and its mystery.
   According to Ms. Bouzek, Therese Hervet, 43, of Reims, France,
sent a letter to the name and city inscribed on the back of the
watch. The inscription on the watch read, ``E.R. Bouzek, Prairie du
Chien, Wis.''
   Ms. Hervet wrote that she had found the watch among her
grandfather's belongings. She said her grandfather had purchased it
at an auction in southern France in the 1940s.
   Ms. Bouzek said she wrote back explaining that the watch was her
late brother's.
   She said she was surprised to learn that her brother engraved
her initials and her married name on the back of his watch.
   But if nothing else the watch introduced Ms. Bouzek and Ms.
Hervet, and they have exchanged several letters.
   ``It's like shaking hands in friendship across the ocean,'' she
said. ``I still can't believe it after 44 years.''

   President Reagan's decision to order military
strikes against two Iranian offshore platforms came without any
build-up in the number of U.S. warships in the region.
   Ever since February, when the Pentagon adjusted its Joint Task
Force Middle East by withdrawing the battleship Iowa and the
helicopter carrier Okinawa, the Navy's presence in the region has
remained fairly constant at between 25 and 30 ships.
   Of that total, roughly half _ including six mine sweepers _
normally operate inside the Persian Gulf, ready to escort
commercial tankers. The other half _ led by the aircraft carrier
Enterprise _ operate in the nearby Gulf of Oman and northern
Arabian Sea.
   According to Pentagon officials who asked not to be named,
Monday's operation saw commanders move several ships from the Gulf
of Oman into the Persian Gulf, including the destroyers Joseph
Strauss, O'Brien, Merrill and Lynde McCormick and the frigate
Bagley.
   That was considered more than enough firepower to deal with the
offshore platforms and any Iranian ships that sought to intervene,
the sources said.
   Fighters and attack jets from the Enterprise also provided
constant air cover over the lower half of the gulf, the sources
said.
   All told, the Navy battle group inside the gulf at the time of
Monday's attack included the command ship Coronado; a combat stores
ship; the six mine sweepers; plus one cruiser, one amphibious
landing ship, four destroyers and seven frigates.
   The Enterprise and a second cruiser remained outside the gulf in
the northern Arabian Sea along with a handful of support ships, the
officials added.
   As for the Iranians, according to Jim McCoy of the Institute for
Strategic Studies, Iran has four 1500-ton, ``quite small''
frigates, built in Britain for the shah of Iran in 1971-72. ``They
are their most modern surface ships, and Iran has been maintaining
patrols with these frigates in the Strait of Hormuz, assisted by a
number of amphibious ships.''
   Paul Beaver, naval editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, adds that
the four are Vosper Mark-5 frigates and have been ``very active
recently.'' He says Iran also has a number of larger patrol craft
which are Cape-class, U.S. Coast Guard-like vessels.
   McCoy said Iran has three destroyers believed non-operational,
one from Britain, two from the United States.
   He said Iran also has at least 50 of ``what are basically
recreational speed boats, 40-footers, with large engines in which
Revolutionary Guards carry out attacks (on tankers) with
rocket-propelled grenades.''
   Beaver calls them Swedish-built Boghammers, and said they are
equipped with machine guns and sometimes mortars. According to
Jane's Iran also has:
   _11 French attack craft (missile) with American Harpoon missile
systems, but because as of 1986 Iran had only nine missiles left,
the boats have been used as gunboats.
   _two (out of four) Corvette 900-ton warships left in operation,
six Hovercraft, two Midget subs whose origin is unknown and which
have not been in operation yet, and two landing ships.
   In the Air, Beaver lists eight F-14 Tomcat fighters, 20 F-4
Phantom fighter bombers and as many as 40 F-5 Tigers, all U.S.
built.
   Also, they have one maritime patrol aircraft, a number of small
spotting craft and a number of Agusta 212 helicopters used by
Revolutionary Guards.
   Don Kerr of the Institute adds that Iran has one P-3 Orion
aircraft ``but it's thought that it has almost nothing electronic
working so is used for visual reconnaisance'' plus out of a
collection of 26 C-130s, maybe now as low as 15 work for transport
purposes.

<HEAD>Socialist Mayor's Support of Jackson Miffs Some Vermont Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The socialist mayor of Vermont's largest
city has exasperated Democrats for years, siphoning off votes that
might otherwise go to Democratic candidates.
   Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders has finally found a Democrat he
likes _ presidential candidate Jesse Jackson _ but even that irks
some local party leaders.
   ``Sanders has been bashing Democrats for years and it seems
totally incongruous for him now to come and speak as a Democrat,''
said city Alderwoman Nancy Chioffi, who supports Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis for president.
   ``There are lots of Democrats, mainstream Burlington Democrats,
who have worked for Jesse Jackson,'' argued Craig Fuller, executive
director of the Vermont Democratic Party. He said one of them is
just as well qualified to speak for Jackson at Tuesday's caucus.
   Jackson won the meaningless ``beauty contest'' primary in
Vermont on March 1, but the state's 14 pledged delegates will be
chosen through the caucus process.
   Sanders intends to make the nominating speech for Jackson at his
local caucus, one of more than 200 that will be held around the
state.
   For Sanders to attend and participate in a Democratic Party
function is something new both for the mayor and the party. It is
not just that Sanders has been critical of the Democrats _ he
describes the Democratic and Republican parties as ``tweedledee and
tweedledum'' _ but that he has worked to defeat Democrats.
   Sanders was an independent candidate for governor in 1986,
receiving 15 percent of the vote in his unsuccessful bid to oust
the Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a strong Dukakis support who will attend
the same caucus as Sanders.
   This year finds Sanders running as an independent for the U.S.
House. Some Democrats fear his candidacy might help elect a
Republican because Sanders and the Democratic nominee could split
the progressive vote.
   For his part, Sanders vows to mind his manners at the Democratic
caucus. ``It is my intention absolutely not to insult anybody, not
to pick any fights. ... My views about the Democratic and
Republican parties remain unchanged. But (Tuesday) night is not the
time. There will be no negative words coming out of my mouth about
anybody or any party.''
   Jackson supporters say they feel Sanders' presence at the caucus
will symbolize Jackson's success at attracting new voters.
   ``My focus is on Jesse,'' said Caryl Stewart, a former city
party chairwoman and unsuccessful candidate to remove Sanders from
the mayor's office. ``What's really important is that we put aside
all the local differences that we've had.''
   Dukakis has long been favored to win the caucuses but Jackson
supporters have been working long and hard to make the caucus
results reflect the primary victory.

<HEAD>U.S. Destroys Iranian Oil Platforms, Sinks Patrol Boat, Bombs
Frigates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy today destroyed two
offshore Iranian oil platforms, sank a defending Iranian patrol
boat and bombed two Iranian navy frigates. Iran attacked oil
facilities off Sharjah and fired on at least two U.S. vessels.
   The American attack on the Persian Gulf oil platforms came in
retaliation for a mine explosion that tore a hole in an American
frigate last week, injuring 10 crewmen.
   ``We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke it,''
President Reagan said. ``They must know that we will protect our
ships, and if they threaten us, they'll pay a price.''
   Also today, Iran said the United States had entered the
Iran-Iraq war, charging that U.S. helicopters supported an Iraqi
land offensive in the Faw Peninsula. The Pentagon dismissed the
charge, saying no U.S. military forces have been involved with
Iraqi units.
   The White House said three U.S. warships ships blasted each
Iranian platform. No American casualties were reported in the U.S.
attacks, and the Iranians fled prior to the shelling, the White
House said.
   Iran said a number of oil workers aboard the two platforms were
killed or injured. It gave no details.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said an American helicopter
also was fired upon during the raid but was not hit.
   One U.S. warship fired missiles at two approaching Iranian jet
fighters, but the fighters reversed course and it was unclear
whether they were hit, Carlucci said.
   He said an Iranian patrol boat fired on the U.S. cruiser
Wainwright, which took part in the attack on one of the platforms.
   The Wainwright was not hit. He said the U.S. frigate Simpson
returned fire and sank the patrol boat.
   About seven hours after the oil platform attack, the 310-foot
Iranian frigate Sahand ``was noticed closing rapidly upon three
U.S. warships,'' said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   The Iranian warship then fired upon three U.S. aircraft on
patrol in the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the gulf.
   The aircraft, A-6 Intruders, ``returned fire with two Harpoon
missiles and a number of laser-guided bombs. Shortly thereafter,
the USS Strauss, a destroyer, engaged the Sahand with an additional
Harpoon,'' Howard said.
   He said the Sahand was on fire and ``the smoke is so heavy that
it's difficult to do a further assessment at this point.''
   At 9:40 a.m. EDT, about 70 minutes after the Sahand attack, Navy
jets attacked a second Iranian frigate, the Sabalan, after it fired
on U.S. planes from the aircraft carrier Enterprise.
   U.S. A-6 Intruders ``returned fire and hit the Sabalan with a
single laser-guided bomb,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``As darkness fell, the Sabalan was down by the stern with tugs
fore and aft. We do not intend to renew attacks on the Sabalan
unless she exhibits further hostile intent,'' the Pentagon said.
   No American injuries or casualties were reported in either
frigate attack.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the U.S.
warships first struck the Sassan platform in the southern gulf at 9
a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT). Twenty-three minutes later they attacked the
Nasr platform at nearby Sirri Island, IRNA said.
   An Iranian warship later shelled the Mubarak oilfield off
Sharjah, an emirate in the southern gulf, shipping executives said.
   Targeted in the attack were the Scanbay drilling rig, the
112,744-ton British tanker York Marine and a storage facility.
   The executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
York Marine was set afire and that its crew had abandoned the
vessel. The Scanbay reported it was under attack by four gunboats,
they said.
   The Iranians also fired on the press helicopter of the NBC
television network, but did not harm the aircraft or its
passengers, executives said.
   The London-based LLoyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit reported a
U.S. tugboat and supply vessel, the Willi Tide, also was fired on
off Sharjah but was not hit.
   They said unidentified warplanes swooped low over the attacking
Iranian boats, chasing them away from the 283-ton vessel, operated
by Tidewater Inc. of New Orleans.
   Shipping executives later reported Iranian gunboats attacked and
set fire to a Cypriot bulk carrier in the Strait of Hormuz.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since 1980, and the war has
produced repeated attacks on neutral shipping. Last July, the
United States reflagged 11 Kuwaiti tankers and gave them U.S. Navy
escorts to protect them against Iranian attack.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, said U.S. helicopters
attacked Iranian troops in southern Iraq ``several times'' on
Sunday.
   The Iranian report was issued after Iraq said its troops, led by
the Presidential Guard, recaptured Faw. Iran, which seized the
peninsula two years ago, denied Iraqi had retaken it.
   The White House said today the oil platform attacks were ``a
measured response to Iran's unlawful use of force.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States raided the
platforms because Iran was responsible for the ``mine attack'' on
the USS Samuel B. Roberts.
   The platforms were manned by Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
Fitzwater said they were given several minutes warning, and some
were seen leaving.
   The White House spokesman said the frigates Simpson and Bagley
and the cruiser Wainwright attacked the Sirri platform.
   Fitzwater said the destroyers Merril and McCormick and the
landing platform ship Trenton attacked the Sassan platform.
   The shipping executives said their monitors picked up a radio
message about 30 minutes before the attack in which a U.S. warship
urged platform workers to evacuate.
   The executives said the warning specified the facilities ``will
be shelled in five minutes.''
   The Iranians radioed back: ``We have no instructions to leave
the place.''
   Eight minutes later, the American warship, which the executives
could not identify, said: ``We will blast the platform in half a
second.''
   In October 1987, U.S. warships destroyed Rostam, the sister
platform to Sassan, after Iran fired a Chinese Silkworm missile
into a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil tanker, injuring 18 crewmen.

<TEXT>
   The father of a trapeze artist who was
killed when she fell 18 feet during a performance said he had
begged his daughter to quit the act, but that she insisted on
continuing to perform.
   Belinda Nielsen Visingard of Circus USA died Sunday in front of
900 people when she slipped from the trapeze bar and fell head
first to the floor.
   She always performed without a net, her family said.
   Police shut down the circus for the night.
   ``She would have said the show must go on,'' said Gunnar
Amandis, Ms. Visingard's uncle and booking agent. ``The rest of the
crew wanted to keep going in her memory.''
   Finn Nielsen of Sarasota said he had told his 31-year-old
daughter he would support her for the rest of her life if she would
quit her high-flying, daredevil circus performances.
   ``I tried everything I could think of to get her to quit. I told
her she'd never have to work again if she would just stop
performing,'' said Nielsen, a former circus performer himself.
``But nothing could stop her, because this is what she loved to do.
Once you're in this kind of life, you want to stay in it.''
   Amandis said he told her Saturday night to stop taking so many
chances during her routine.
   ``She would start her act with tricks others closed their acts
with,'' Amandis said. ``I told her to ease up a bit, but she just
kept doing her act the way she wanted. Because this was probably
the lowest height she's ever worked from, maybe she wanted to be
more daring.''
   Amandis said Ms. Visingard was almost finished with her routine
when she fell. He saw the accident.
   ``She could've jumped down from that height and not gotten
hurt,'' he said. ``It was a freak accident. It was the way she
fell. No other way would she have been hurt. God must have wanted
to take her.''
   Tom Koenig, 40, of Hialeah, who took his wife and two children
to the show, agreed.
   ``She fell forward, and she was trying to right herself up, and
by doing that she fell right on the side of her face,'' he said.
``She wasn't that high up. She just hit the wrong way.''
   ``At the second she fell, everybody was silent,'' said his wife,
Annie Koenig. ``Everybody thought it was part of the act. Then we
realized what had happened.''
   Amandis said a police check of his niece's equipment revealed
that everything was in perfect order.
   Ms. Visingard, who performed using the name Belinda Amandis, was
born into a circus family in Lansdale, Pa., her parents said. She
joined The Amandis, a family teeterboard act that included her
mother and father, when she was about 8 or 9 years old, her father
said.
   Ms. Visingard started a trapeze act with her ex-husband about
eight years ago, the family said. She always performed without a
net, they said.
   Nielsen and his wife left the circus life about 12 years ago, he
said. He now works as a detention officer for the Sarasota County
Sheriff's Office. But his daughter didn't want to do anything but
perform.
   ``She loved the life,'' said her mother, Ella Nielsen. ``She
loved the people, the crowds, and she loved to do daring things.''

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Retook Town of Faw on Strategic Peninsula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said its forces Monday retook the town
of Faw near the tip of a strategic Iraqi peninsula that had been
captured by Iran more than two years ago.
   Iran claimed U.S. helicopters attacked Iranian troops and Kuwait
provided a staging area to support the Iraqi offensive. The United
States and Kuwait denied the charge.
   Thousands of Iranians were killed or wounded in the two-day-old
offensive, named ``Blessed Ramadan'' after the Moslem fasting
month, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
   It was the first time Iraq took the initiative in a major ground
push since the early years of the 7{-year-old war.
   ``Victorious Iraqi armed forces entered Faw town today and
hoisted the Iraqi flag,'' the state-run agency reported in an
urgent dispatch.
   A war communique read over state-run television said Iranian
occupying forces were driven out of the peninsula, over to the
other side of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway that forms its northern
shore.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a Supreme Defense
Council statement as saying: ``In direct, open and practical
support for the Iraqi regime, American forces have entered the
war.''
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said in Washington that Iran's
charge was totally without foundation. No U.S. military forces have
been involved with Iraqi units, he said.
   Earlier in the day, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reiterated claims that Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ``routed''
the offensive when it was launched Saturday night.
   The agency repeated accusations that Iraq used chemical weapons
against Iranian defenders in the Faw region.
   In the ``war of the cities,'' Iraqi missile batteries fired
long-range rockets into Tehran, the holy city of Qom and Isfahan.
The Iranian agency confirmed the three cities were struck by
missiles and civilians were killed. It gave no figures.
   Iraq said an Iranian missile landed in Baghdad, killing
civilians.
   The Iraqi agency said troops of the Seventh Army Corps, backed
by elite Presidential Guards, took the ``Faw triangle,'' the bulk
of the peninsula that juts out into the Persian Gulf and straddles
Iraq's only sea outlet. It later reported the seizure of the town
of Faw, the only town on the peninsula.
   In the two-pronged offensive, Iraqi forces stormed Iranian
positions from the west across the salt marshes that form most of
the peninsula and also attacked its northern shore.
   ``The invaders are now licking their wounds on the other bank of
the Shatt-al-Arab, distancing themselves from the confrontation
line with the Iraqis,'' said a communique quoted by INA.
   ``God is great. Blessed be the Iraqi victory. Blessed be the
Arabs' victory and blessed be the victory of our armed forces.''
   The Iraqi accounts said the bulk of the Iranian forces in the
peninsula were destroyed, but they did not claim the entire
peninsula was retaken. They said Iraqi forces continued their
advance.
   IRNA, in reports monitored in Cyprus, claimed that ``in an open
confession of their dirty ganging-up, U.S. and Iraqi forces using
Kuwaiti facilities attacked Iranian positions in the Faw region,
southern Iraq'' on Monday.
   It claimed U.S. helicopter gunships ``suddenly appeared on the
battle scene from the sea side and attacked Iranian combatants.''
   The agency claimed Iranian Revolutionary Guards immediately
opened fire on the U.S. helicopters, forcing them to ``hastily drop
their rockets and flee the scene.''
   The accusation came after U.S. forces destroyed two Iranian oil
platforms in the gulf in retaliation for allegedly planting the
mine that almost sank a U.S. frigate last week.
   In a series of clashes later in the day, U.S. forces sank an
Iranian patrol boat and bombed two Iranian frigates, setting them
ablaze, after they shot at U.S. planes and ships, the Pentagon said.
   Since they were driven out of Iranian territory in 1982, Iraqi
forces have waged a largely defensive war.
   The Faw peninsula, about 50 miles southeast of Iraq's major port
city of Basra, was lost to the Iranian attackers in a major
offensive in February 1986.
   Iranian troops carried out a nighttime amphibious landing in
Faw, erecting a pontoon bridge.
   They eventually retained about 120 square miles of the
peninsula, using their new positions to shell Iraq's main air base
near Basra.
   They also reportedly used Faw to launch anti-ship, Chinese-made
Silkworm missiles at Kuwaiti ships and oil facilities.

<TEXT>
   An artificial reef made up of 23
concrete structures is being dropped into the Atlantic Ocean this
week, and engineers predict it could be an answer to beach erosion.
   The $200,000 cost of the project will be borne by millionaire
Willis du Pont, who will have four sections of the reef submerged
off the coast of his Palm Beach property.
   The structure, designed by engineer Hans Rauch, has been tested
by engineers at Florida Atlantic University and the University of
Florida. Many past experiments with other reefs have failed,
engineers said.
   Windy conditions in Riviera Beach Monday delayed loading of a
barge that was to carry parts of the reef to the site off Palm
Beach.
   Du Pont, an heir to the Delaware chemical fortune, agreed to pay
for the experimental reef, and its installation, after learning
that his beachfront property is washing into the sea.
   Stretching parallel to the beach, the concrete structures will
be sunk 175 feet off the coast, about 3 feet under the surface of
the water.
   Each structure is 25 feet long, 12 feet wide and 5 feet high,
and is designed to break a wave before it reaches the shoreline,
thus reducing or stopping the drift of sand from the beach.
   Once in the water, the reef will be tested by University of
Florida researchers, who also will be checking to see if marine
life grows on the reef.

<HEAD>Summary of Prosecution, Defense Arguments in Demjanjuk Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Demjanjuk, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following is a summary of prosecution and
defense arguments in the Nazi war crimes trial of John Demjanjuk:
   
   THE PROSECUTION:
   The prosecution claimed Demjanjuk is ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a
brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at
the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   Prosecutors presented five Treblinka survivors who identified
Demjanjuk as ``Ivan'' in photo lineups that included a 1952 picture
of the defendant and another taken from his alleged Nazi identity
card.
   Survivor Pinchas Epstein pointed to Demjanjuk in court and said
he recognized the defendant's walk, while survivor Eliyahu
Rosenberg said he remembered Demjanjuk's ``murderous eyes.''
   The prosecution's most pivotal evidence was Demjanjuk's alleged
Nazi identity card. Issued at Trawniki, a training camp for death
camp guards, the document does not mention Treblinka but states
Demjanjuk was posted at the nearby Sobibor death camp.
   Six prosecution experts authenticated the paper, ink, photograph
and signatures on the Trawniki card. One expert produced a video
showing how the photograph of the young guard on the card matched
the present-day Demjanjuk almost exactly. In addition, two
historians vouched for the document's historical authenticity.
   In a grueling week-long cross-examination, prosecutors showed
inconsistencies in Demjanjuk's version of his whereabouts during
World War II and accused him of hiding his true identity.
   
   THE DEFENSE:
   Demjanjuk claimed he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity
and says he was a Nazi prisoner-of-war during the years of
Treblinka's operation, 1942-43.
   Demjanjuk admitted lying on his U.S. immigration application,
saying he was a Polish farmer rather than a Ukrainian soldier, but
he insists it was because he feared forced repatriation to the
Soviet Union and not because he was hiding a Nazi past.
   A psychology expert raised doubts about the reliability of the
Treblinka survivors' memories more than 40 years after the
Holocaust. He also contended the photo lineups were biased against
Demjanjuk because his picture was the largest, clearest and the
only one of a bald man.
   Demjanjuk's attorneys presented 12 statements from Treblinka
inmates who failed to identify Demjanjuk's picture as ``Ivan.''
   Demjanjuk claims the Trawniki card was forged by the Soviet
Union, which provided it and three other other similar documents to
Israel. He says the Soviets wanted to frame Demjanjuk because he
served in an anti-Communist unit organized by the Germans at the
end of World War II.
   The defense also called six experts who contended the Trawniki
card was forged. One document expert said the paper could not have
been produced in Nazi Germany because it was made of rags, a
material that was scarce during World War II.
   Defense witnesses also said Demjanjuk's signature on the card
was forged and contended the picture on the document, even if it
portrayed Demjanjuk, was not the original but had been glued on at
a later date.
   Several defense witnesses were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were called into question.
   Some defense witnesses also offered bizarre arguments, including
one who claimed the Soviet secret service used ``thought power'' to
kill its enemies and inflict disasters on the West.

<HEAD>Amish Abate Opposition To Immunizations To Fight Measles Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW WILMINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Amish communities in
northwestern Pennsylvania have dropped their normal opposition to
immunizations and sent 125 children to get shots to fight an
outbreak of measles.
   ``Our concern right now is mainly with the Amish,'' said Bruce
Reimer, spokesman for the state Health Department. ``Most do not
accept immunizations and our fear is that it will get into other
pockets of Amish.
   ``This is the time of year when many will travel to other areas
to visit family and friends, and a lot of weddings will be going
on. There is a potential for spreading.''
   Reimer said the first reports of measles among Amish occurred in
Lawrence and Mercer counties in the northwestern part of the state
in early December. He said the outbreak is apparently ``pretty much
nipped'' after 142 confirmed cases in four months.
   Reimer said Monday there appears to be no outbreak of measles
among the state's largest concentration of Amish in Lancaster
County in southeastern Pennsylvania.
   Carlos Flores, a pediatrician, said two special clinics in New
Wilmington inoculated 125 Amish children and young adults on
Friday. Some arrived in traditional horse-drawn buggies. He said
his office has scheduled more inoculations for Friday.
   ``Some of the Amish people tell their daughters and sons that
it's worse if they have the shot than if they had the diesease.
It's not true,'' Flores said. ``They're spreading that word among
them. The side effects of measles alone can be more dangerous.''
   Flores said only about 20 percent of Amish in his practice
follow normal inoculation patterns against disease.
   The measles outbreak forced three of 10 Amish schools to close
in Lawrence and Mercer counties, two because students were ill and
one because a teacher was ill, officials said. Two schools remained
closed through last week, officials said.
   ``We have nurses in the area talking to the Amish bishops,
trying to locate additional cases,'' Reimer said. ``Getting
information from the Amish is difficult.''

   John Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker with a
ready smile, described himself as simple man with a fourth-grade
education who survived near-starvation in the Soviet Ukraine by
eating birds, rats and the family cat.
   ``My tragic mistake is I can't think properly. I don't know how
to answer,'' Demjanjuk told the court in a revealing moment.
   The second man to be tried in Israel for Nazi war crimes,
Demjanjuk became more human to many Israelis than Adolf Eichmann,
the first to stand trial, because he learned some Hebrew and his
family attended nearly every session.
   Demjanjuk was convicted Monday of war crimes committed as ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' the brutal Treblinka death camp guard who operated
gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland in
1942 and 1943.
   During his trial, Demjanjuk chatted with police guards, laughed
good naturedly during sessions and shouted the Hebrew greeting
``Shalom'' to bystanders as he was led handcuffed to and from court.
   He even tried to shake hands with a Treblinka survivor, who
recoiled in horror and called Demjanjuk a murderer.
   Before being yanked into the public eye by charges he was a
brutal Nazi guard, the 68-year-old grandfather lived a quiet life
centered on family and friends in Cleveland's close-knit Ukrainian
community, where Demjanjuk emigrated in 1952.
   When he took the stand in Israel, Demjanjuk endeavored to win
sympathy by describing his own hardships in the Soviet Ukraine and
portraying himself as a mild-mannered man who ``couldn't even kill
a chicken.''
   ``Me and my relatives were forced to eat birds, mice, rats and
even our pet cat,'' Demjanjuk said of his childhood in the Ukraine
in 1932 and 1933.
   The balding defendant tried to explain away inconsistencies in
his version of his whereabouts during World War II by blaming his
lack of education and faulty memory.
   ``What do you expect when I had only four years of schooling?''
he said in helpless frustration during a grueling weeklong
cross-examination last August.
   Demjanjuk's three children describe their father as a patient,
good-natured man who tried to make life more homey in his dreary
Israeli isolation cell by hanging hundreds of cards from
well-wishers and family photographs onto the walls.
   Alone in his prison cell, Demjanjuk lifted his spirits by
reading from a Ukrainian-language Bible and doing sit-ups and
push-ups to relieve tension, his children said in interviews.
   Demjanjuk and his wife, Vera, 62, worked long factory shifts to
attain a measure of the good life. They bought a house in the
middle-class Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills, where Demjanjuk
planted a garden.
   ``My dad enjoyed seeing things grow. He was squeamish about
killing anything, even worms in the garden,'' said Demjanjuk's
daughter, Irene Nishnic, 28.
   On Aug. 25, 1977, the first accusations against Demjanjuk
appeared in the U.S. media.
   After a six-week trial in February 1981, when Demjanjuk admitted
lying to immigration authorites, he was stripped of his U.S.
citizenship.
   He was extradited to Israel in February 1986 and his
14-month-long trial began one year later.
   Describing her father, Mrs. Nishnic said: ``My dad is a good
man, a loving man. He's never beat on me, he's never hurt me. But
that's not going to make any difference, is it?''

   A man identified as a member of Kuwait's
royal family spoke Monday from the hijacked Kuwaiti jetliner and he
said he hoped his government yields to the gunmen's demands to end
the two-week ordeal.
   Most of the brief radio message from the man the hijackers said
was Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah was impossible to understand, except for
the part about their demand that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
prisoners convicted in the 1983 attacks on the U.S. and French
embassies in the Persian Gulf sheikdom.
   ``I hope that Kuwait releases all the prisoners,'' the man said,
speaking in Arabic in a feeble, halting voice. Kuwaiti officials
insist they will not give in to the hijackers, who have killed two
Kuwaiti passengers.
   Three of the approximately 35 people still aboard the Kuwait
Airways Boeing 747 that was hijacked April 5 are distant relatives
of the emir of Kuwait. Two of those relatives are women.
   Hostages released earlier have said al-Sabah is in worse
condition than any of the other hostages aboard the jet, describing
him as ``the most psychologically broken down'' and suffering from
a stomach ailment.
   When the message was read on the plane's radio about 3:10 p.m.
(10:10 a.m. EDT), the control tower had trouble understanding it.
   ``It was not very clear. Could he try to say it once more?'' the
control tower said in English.
   ``No, because he doesn't want to speak, but I want to confirm
that he is one of the royal family, he is Fadel Al-Sabah,'' a
hijacker responded in English.
   Radio conversations Monday made no reference to refueling the
plane or leaving Algeria. On Saturday, the gunmen said they wanted
fuel to fly elsewhere and commit a ``massacre,'' but Sunday they
said they would give Algeria more time to seek a solution. No
deadline was announced.
   Monday was the first day of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan,
when the faithful fast during the day. After sunset, the plane
radioed a request for 40 meals, which were then hoisted up in
packets with tied tablecloths.
   During Ramadan, observant Moslems do not eat or drink during
daylight hours. At the hijackers request, a traditional pre-fast
meal was delivered to the plane Sunday night for all aboard.
   Talks lasted late into the night, and two hooded hijackers even
descended from the plane to meet with an Algerian negotiator Monday
morning in a car on the airport tarmac, but the pace of contacts
seemed to slow during the hazy, hot day.
   Radio Algiers, in an Arabic language news broadcast Monday, said
there was ``hope that a peaceful solution is still possible''
despite no indication that either side would make any concessions.
   The oficial radio reported ``new movement that gives a chance
for new elements,'' but did not elaborate.
   Algerian officials have been acting as mediators between a
high-level delegation from Kuwait and the gunmen, boarding the
plane several times a day for talks, little of whose substance has
been disclosed.
   The jumbo jet was hijacked while en route from Bangkok to Kuwait
with 112 people aboard, and first diverted to Mashhad in
northeastern Iran, where 57 passengers were freed. On April 8, it
was flown to Larnaca, Cyprus, where the hijackers killed two
passengers and released 13 others. It came to Algiers' Houari
Boumedienne Airport on Wednesday.
   Monday's plea to Kuwait was the fourth by a passenger since the
plane landed in Algeria.
   The hijackers only direct threat was that made Saturday when
they asked that the plane be refueled so they could ``settle our
score'' with Kuwait in another country, rather than ``friendly
Algeria.''
   Algerian Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, in charge of the
mediation effort, said early on he had obtained a promise from the
hijackers that they would not resort to violence on Algerian soil.

<HEAD>German Hacker Blamed for Breaking Into U.S. Military Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hacker linked his home computer to
about 50 U.S. military computers to gain access to sensitive
defense and aerospace information, a prosecutor said Monday.
   The 24-year-old university student tapped into the worldwide
computers for nearly two years through telephone links, according
to the West German newsmagazine Quick.
   West German authorities dropped their case, however, for lack of
evidence. FBI spokesmen said they were investigating but declined
to say if charges would be brought.
   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven who
originated these calls,'' said Hans-Georg von Bock, a prosecuting
attorney in Bremen.
   He said the hacker scoured California computers at the Air Force
Systems Command in El Segundo, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasedena, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley.
   Bock refused to say what the hacker, who lives in the northern
city of Hanover, discovered. Quick said he was able to find out the
names of U.S. Army officers in Japan and details about U.S. coastal
security systems.
   Authorities did not say if any important secrets were robbed.
   Bock said he remained convinced of the Hanover man's guilt. ``We
wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but unfortunately
that did not happen,'' he said.
   The prosecutor said West German investigators had been hampered
because law only allows wiretaps to investigate more serious crimes
like murder. A telephone tap would have enabled West German
authorities to trace the suspect's calls.
   Computer hackers use telephone connections to gain unauthorized
access to other computers, often just for fun.
   Bock said the computer connections in this case were made by
telephone via a computer at Bremen University.
   Quick said a connection with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
allowed the hacker to link to computers worldwide. However, the
magazine did not provide further details or identify the hacker.
   Bock said he could provide no details about the hacker because
the West German investigation had been dropped.
   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986
by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which does broad-based
unclassified research.
   The laboratory and its companion institution, the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which researches nuclear weapons and the
Reagan administratoin's space-based missile defense system, are
operated by the University of California for the U.S. government.
   Quick said authorities questioned the suspect in June and that
the break-ins stopped at about the same time.

   Artist Louise Nevelson, who struggled until she
was nearly 60 to win the public's attention, has died at the age of
88 with a reputation as one of the nation's greatest sculptors.
   Mrs. Nevelson, who had been in poor health for several months,
died Sunday at her home in Manhattan's Little Italy.
   She recently completed a 35-foot black steel sculpture for the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her 1950s
work is scheduled this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.
   ``She's seen as one of the great artists of our time,'' said
Thomas Messer, director of the Guggenheim museum and an
acquaintance of the late artist.
   Mrs. Nevelson was ``a walking work of art. ... Every gesture in
her life and every form in her art had larger meanings,'' he said.
   A regal woman who wore mainly black, the artist was perhaps best
known for black-on-black wood boxes assembled from ``found''
objects.
   Her work was big, dramatic, often dark and intense. Some critics
felt it was cold, airless and sterile. Others called it graceful,
warm, haunting and uplifting.
   Her works are included in the collections of many major museums
and have been taken on exhibitions around the nation and the world.
   Mrs. Nevelson was born in Kiev, Russia, in 1899. Her family
immigrated when she was 4 and settled in Rockland, Maine.
   ``I felt like an artist,'' she said of the talent that emerged
in childhood. ``I have that blessing, and there was never a time
that I questioned it or doubted it.''
   ``She was enormously honest, enormously gifted and ferociously
independent,'' recalled Maurine Rothschild, president of the
William A. Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland.
   In 1920, she married Charles Nevelson, a wealthy New York ship
owner, and moved to New York City. They had a son, Myron, and
separated in 1931.
   Mrs. Nevelson then traveled to Munich to study. Upon the rise of
the Nazis, she returned to New York to work with paint, plaster,
terra cotta, marble, aluminum, bronze and bits of wood.
   ``She was one of the most important artists in America, along
with Georgia O'Keeffe,'' said Peter Dittmar, art critic for the Die
Welt newspaper in Bonn, West Germany.
   Although Mrs. Nevelson was a serious artist for half a century,
her work was largely ignored until 1958, when it was included in an
anthology at the Museum of Modern Art.
   ``She was intensely independent and very courageous. She set an
astounding example of artistic integrity and recognition for women
artists,'' said Richard Oldenburg, MOMA director. ``I remember the
flamboyance of her appearance ... her tremendous warmth and spirit.
She had a large reserve of wit _ she was very good company.''
   Mrs. Nevelson's fame grew in 1959 when, at the age of 60, she
won acclaim for her first all-white ``environment,'' titled
``Dawn's Wedding Feast.''
   ``Once she emerged as a major figure in the late '50s, she could
never again be ignored,'' critic Hilton Kramer wrote in an
introduction to ``Nevelson's World'' in 1983. ``She turned out to
be one of those artists who changed the way we look at things.''
   ``Louise Nevelson was an important artist of originality,
strength and integrity who has made a lasting contribution to the
history of 20th century sculpture,'' said Richard Marshall, an
associate curator who organized Nevelson exhibitions at the Whitney
Museum in New York.
   Age did not slow her. In her 84th year, Mrs. Nevelson embarked
on creating sets and costumes for a production of the opera ``Orfeo
and Euridice'' in St. Louis. In 1985, she was among the first
recipients of the National Medal of the Arts.
   ``She wanted to make a major contribution to the world as an
artist. ... The work will remain,'' said Richard Koshalek, director
of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. ``The individual
will be missed the most _ the spirit and dedication and kindness
that Louise Nevelson demonstrated to other artists, museum and the
world in general.''
   Survivors include her son and three granddaughters. Funeral
services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a
later date.

   Retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk was
convicted Monday of Nazi war crimes by an Israeli court that said
there was no doubt he was ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic death
camp guard who ran gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews.
   The three-judge court convicted Demjanjuk of the four counts
against him: war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, crimes
against humanity and crimes against persecuted people.
   Applause broke out in the courtroom when the verdict was
announced, and a judge admonished the spectators.
   Demjanjuk, 68, listened to the guilty verdict from a cot in a
cell next to the courtroom. Six police officers had carried him
there feet first after he said he was unable to sit down because of
a back injury.
   After the verdict, Demjanjuk slowly walked to a police van and
told reporters: ``I'm very good. I'm an innocent man. I will appeal
and I'm sure I will win.''
   ``This is ridiculous what happened hayom (today),'' said
Demjanjuk, using the Hebrew word for today.
   Surrounded by 18 guards, Demjanjuk walked with his head bowed
and his hands clasped. Two guards supported his arms. He was not
handcuffed.
   Demjanjuk was the second person to be convicted of war crimes in
Israel. Adolf Eichmann, architect of Adolf Hitler's ``Final
Solution'' for the extermination of European Jewry, was hanged in
1962, the only person to have been executed in Israel's 40-year
history.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, who lived in suburban Cleveland
before his extradition to Israel in 1986, could face the death
penalty when he is sentenced April 25. Observers have said he would
probably receive life in prison.
   Presiding Judge Dov Levine said the court had determined
``decisively and without hesitation or doubt'' that Demjanjuk was
```Ivan the Terrible,' the operator of gas chambers.''
   ``The accused wasn't an ordinary guard who just obeyed orders,
but fulfilled a central position in the Treblinka death camp. With
his own hands, he took part in the murders of masses of human
beings,'' Levine said.
   Demjanjuk was accused of operating gas chambers that killed
850,000 Jews at Treblinka in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   Halfway through the 12-hour reading of the 450-page opinion,
Demjanjuk's relatives left the courtroom in protest and did not
return to hear the verdict.
   Demjanjuk's 22-year-old son, John Jr., said the judges were
biased.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this was nothing more than a Soviet
show trial. Whenever one of our witnesses came on, they got the
hammer,'' he said.
   ``This is going to go down in history as the most lopsided case
ever conducted anywhere in the world,'' said Demjanjuk's
son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, who raised $650,000 for the defense.
   Defense attorney John Gill said the court automatically rejected
defense arguments.
   ``My God in heaven, according to the judges we didn't do
anything right. They ruled against us on every single point,'' Gill
said.
   Jewish leaders praised the verdict.
   ``The trial was an affirmation of law and civility in response
to the barbarity of the Holocaust,'' said Harry Wall, director of
the Israel branch of the B'nai Brith Anti-Defamation League, a
major American-Jewish organization.
   Throughout the trial, Demjanjuk maintained his innocence, saying
he was a victim of mistaken identity and was not the infamous guard
who would stand near gas chambers and strike prisoners with a metal
bar or bayonet as they went to their deaths.
   The defense had challenged as unreliable the testimony of five
Holocaust survivors who identified Demjanjuk as ``Ivan.''
   Levine indicated the court gave great weight to the survivors'
testimony.
   ``These experiences are deeply ingrained on their memories, the
horrors are a deep part of them, the sights are before their eyes
and the stories are true and accurate,'' Levine said.
   Defense attorneys also argued that ``Ivan'' was killed in a
prisoner revolt at Treblinka in August 1943. The defense said
Demjanjuk spent the period in question in German prisoner-of-war
camps after being captured while serving in the Soviet army.
   Judge Zvi Tal, whose parents died in the Holocaust, described
reports of ``Ivan's'' death as unproven rumors. He said Demjanjuk's
claim that he spent 18 months at a POW camp as ``totally
unsupportable and implausible.''
   The defense said Demjanjuk's alleged Nazi identity card was
forged by Soviet officials who wanted to punish him for fighting in
an anti-communist unit formed by the Nazis at the end of World War
II.
   The document, a key piece of prosecution evidence, was issued at
Trawniki, a training camp for death camp guards in Nazi-occupied
Poland. The document says Demjanjuk was posted at the Sobibor death
camp, near Treblinka.
   Six prosecution experts authenticated the document, while an
equal number of defense experts said it was forged.
   ``We can conclude the personal details on the ID card are those
of the accused,'' said Judge Daliah Dorner.
   During the trial, two of the defense's 15 expert witnesses were
discredited. One retracted her testimony and another tried to
commit suicide after her credentials were questioned by the court.
   The trial opened Feb. 16, 1987, a year after Demjanjuk was
extradited to Israel. Demjanjuk had been stripped of his U.S.
citizenship for lying on his immigration application.
   About 250,000 spectators attended the emotion-charged trial in a
converted movie theater. The proceedings were broadcast live on
radio and TV.

<HEAD>Radio Says Kidnapped Marine Has Been Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beirut radio station reported Monday
that U.S. Marine Lt. Col William R. Higgins was killed by his
kidnappers this month after several weeks in captivity.
   United Nations officials said they had heard nothing to confirm
the report by the Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon.
   The station, which has broadcast several inaccurate reports
about the hostages in Lebanon, said Higgins was ``killed and buried
by his captors'' early this month in Siddiqine, a village in south
Lebanon.
   Higgins was serving with the U.N. Interim Force in south Lebanon
when he was kidnapped near the southern port of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   Timur Goksel, the spokesman for the U.N. group, said Monday:
``We have no such information, and therefore we cannot comment on
the radio report.''
   ``We have checked with our sources, and everybody was surprised
when they heard about the report,'' he added in a telephone
interview from the U.N. group's headquarters in Naqoura on the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Nadia Younes told
reporters that UNIFIL had checked with its sources and found no
confirmation of the broadcast.
   The radio said Higgins was killed hours before pro-Syrian
militiamen of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia captured
Siddiqine from supporters of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, apparently
to keep Amal from claiming credit for his liberation.
   Amal and Hezbollah spokesmen in Beirut did not comment on the
report. The two groups have been at odds since Higgins, 43, of
Danville, Ky., was kidnapped.
   Siddiqine, 10 miles southeast of Tyre, was a Hezbollah
stronghold before Amal crushed its Shiite Moslem fundamentalist
rivals in a four-day battle early this month.
   Amal supports the presence of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
predominantly Shiite south Lebanon. Hezbollah, or the Party of God,
opposes it.
   Amal has charged that Hezbollah masterminded Higgins' abduction
to undermine Amal's control of south Lebanon.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for factions holding
most of the 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. It has not claimed to
hold any foreign hostages.
   Higgins' abduction was claimed by a group calling itself the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which charged that he was a
CIA spy. Both the United States and United Nations have denied the
charge.
   Amal spokesmen had said their fighters found no trace of Higgins
in any of the Hezbollah strongholds they captured.
   The foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon are
nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, one Irishman, one
Italian, one West German, one Indian, and two unidentified men.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Here is the text of the statement by White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Monday's U.S. military action
in the Persian Gulf:
   ``Acting under his authority as commander-in-chief, the
president has directed U.S. forces at 1 a.m. EDT today to strike
Iranian military targets in the southern Persian Gulf. Our forces
attacked oil platforms at Sirri and Sassan in the southern Gulf.
These platforms are used as command and control radar stations for
the Iranian military.
   The attacks are under way at this time.
   These actions were taken in response to Iran's recent resumption
of minelaying in international waters and its mine attack on the
USS Samuel B. Roberts. The government of Iran has be of the cash offer
and
restructuring at between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.
   Spokesman D. Emerson Phelps said the deal would allow Irving
management to retain control of the company, although the board of
directors would be expanded to include four representatives from
Banca Commerciale.
   The Banca Commerciale offer, which was approved by both
companies' boards and was set to begin Tuesday, includes the
purchase of 9.5 million Irving shares, or 51 percent of its common
stock outstanding, for $65 a share. In addition, a special
$10-a-share dividend would be payable to shareholders upon
completion of the deal, Irving said.
   The company said stockholders could receive cash for about half
of their shares, and retain the other half and ``thereby
participate in the realization of Irving's attractive long-term
potential.''
   ``Our shareholders will benefit far more from the affiliation
with BCI (Banca Commerciale Italiana) than the proposal advanced
from BNY (Bank of New York),'' Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice said
in a statement. ``Irving anticipates increases in its revenues as a
result of its ongoing relationship with BCI.''
   Irving's announcement comes just days after Bank of New York's
shareholders voted to support management's $1 billion-plus rare
hostile bid for Irving. The tender offer, which began last month
after regulatory approval, is for $15 in cash and 1.575 of its
common shares for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 common shares
outstanding.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in Irving,
also is running a slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board of
directors. Irving's annual meeting is scheduled for Thursday,
although most business will be conducted at a reconvened meeting on
Saturday to give sharholders time to digest the latest offer,
Irving said.
   Irving has repeatedly spurned Bank of New York's takeover
proposals, which began about seven months ago. It had maintained it
wanted to remain independent but disclosed recently it was seeking
a ``white knight'' friendly merger partner as an alternative.
   Hostile takeovers are rare in the banking industry. Although a
few have been tried over the years, most have resulted in the
target companies reaching friendly mergers with third parties. A
merger between Bank of New York and Irving would have created one
of the nation's 15 largest bank holding companies with combined
assets of more than $40 billion.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said his company was
studying the Banca Commerciale offer and had no immediate comment.
   Michael Starr, a banking analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in
Chicago, said Bank of New York could sweeten its current offer, but
then it would have to resubmit itself to the lengthy regulatory
process that includes hearings before the Federal Reserve and New
York State Banking boards.
   Analysts said they weren't surprised that Irving sought help
from a foreign bank, since many large U.S. banks lack the capital
for big acquisitions. However, some experts said they found the
terms of the deal a bit complex and said that probabaly accounted
for the relatively lackluster activity on Wall Street.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Irving shares rose slightly,
then fell $1 to $60.37{. Bank of New York shares gained $1 to
$31.65{.
   ``I thought the Street would have viewed the stock as being
worth more,'' said James L. Bellessa Jr., a banking analyst with
Great Falls, Mont.-based D.A. Davidson & Co.``I think part of the
problem is the Street doesn't understand it all.''
   Bellessa, though, called the deal ``a good alternative to what
Bank of New York was proposing.''
   As part of its restructuring Irving said it would begin ``an
intensive program of cost savings'' that could raise net income to
about $1.60 a share in 1988 and $2.75 next year. In addition, the
banking concern said it would immediately increase Irving's annual
common dividend from $2.42 a share to $4.50.
   Irving lost $193.27 million last year, after raising its
loan-loss reserves to cover troubled Third World debt.
   To pay for the special $10-a-share dividend, which is part of
the Banca Commerciale deal, Irving said it planned to sell its Wall
Street headquarters and its 39 percent equity interest in Banca
della Svizzera Italiana for more than the current market price of
about $325 million.
   Banca Commerciale, based in Milan, has assets of around $60
billion and is Italy's second largest bank, behind Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro. About 64 percent of Banca Commerciale is owned by the
giant state holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale. Irving's assets total $24.12 billion.

<HEAD>Stoddard Disappointed in `Dolly,' `Moonlighting'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC is considering buying out Dolly Parton's
contract and canning her variety show ``Dolly!'' which proved a
disappointment in the ratings, ABC Entertainment President Brandon
Stoddard said Monday.
   ``We're now in a situation where we frankly don't know what
we're going to do about `Dolly!' next year,'' Stoddard told a news
conference.
   ``As you all know, we actually have the right not to do the
show. There is a penalty payment we would pay if we did not go
ahead on the second year,'' Stoddard said. Parton got a two-year
guarantee in her multimillion-dollar contract with ABC. Stoddard
would not say how much the penalty would be.
   Stoddard listed ``Dolly!'' and ``Moonlighting'' as his two
biggest disappointments in a season that saw ABC eke out a
second-place finish after coming in last the previous year. NBC has
won its third season in a row, and CBS finished last for the first
time ever.
   ``Moonlighting,'' formerly a top-10 show, dropped into the top
20 this season, due to frequent repeats and episodes without Cybill
Shepherd, who was pregnant. Nevertheless, Stoddard said, the show
likely will come back next season.
   Stoddard was not optimistic about an early end to the strike by
the Writers Guild of America and said if it lasts into the summer,
it could substantially delay the start of the fall season.
   That could chase more viewers away from the three networks which
have seen a 9 percent decline in audiences since 1986-87, according
to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   A delay would mean more reruns and more viewers would presumably
turn to cable or other alternatives, Stoddard said.
   ``I think the net effect of that is that even when we come back
on the air, it could be the loss of a couple more share points for
the networks,'' he said. ``It's not a happy thought.
   ``In addition to that, when the strike is finished, and we start
putting programs on the air, there's going to be tremendous
pressure to get something up on that screen, and maybe it ain't
perfect when we do. I think there also could be some erosion caused
by the lack of quality. This is a very serious problem.''
   He said ABC is considering repeating miniseries should the
strike cause a significant delay in the start of the new season.
   But the 30-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance,'' which would
be available for the fall, won't be wasted then when NBC will have
the Summer Olympics, Stoddard said. Instead, the ballyhooed
miniseries will likely be saved for the February 1989 sweeps period.
   Stoddard also said, while happy the network was second for the
season in the Nielsen ratings, with an average, prime-time rating
of 13.7 to CBS' 13.5, the performance really was ``not that
terrific.'' NBC had a 16.1.
   Without high-rated prime-time sports _ the World Series, the
Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics _ ABC actually was third.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes
with televisions.
   As for ABC's new shows, Stoddard said there would be some early
pickups announced in a week or so. Those are likely to include
``The Wonder Years'' and ``thirtysomething.''
   Stoddard said it looked good for a renewal of ``Hooperman,'' but
a decision on ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story'' is a ``tough call.''

<HEAD>US Issues Fresh Warning to Iran</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after the U.S. military attack on two
Iranian oil platforms in the Persian Gulf, the United States issued
a fresh message to Iran warning that additional provocations would
be met with a firm U.S. response, the State Department said Monday.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Iranian
authorities were told that the United States was exercising its
right of self-defense following the mine explosion last Friday in
which the USS Samuel B. Roberts was damaged, injuring U.S. Navy
personnel.
   ``The extreme seriousness with which the government of the
United States views such unacceptable activity by Iranian vessels
should be understood by the Islamic government of Iran,'' the
message said.
   ``Any further provocative or hostile Iranian military or
terrorist actions against U.S. personnel or targets will receive a
firm U.S. response.''
   There was no further elaboration and Redman refused to speculate
what response the administration has in mind.
   Redman said five NATO allies _ Britain, Italy, West Germany, the
Netherlands, and Belgium _ were notified before Monday's attack
that the action was pending. All have naval vessels in the Persian
Gulf.
   A group of other countries, including the Soviet Union and Iraq,
was informed as the attack commenced, Redman said.
   Another U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said a cable was
sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts abroad at approximately the same
time the attack took place advising them of the U.S. action and
asking them to guard against possible retaliatory terrorist
incidents.
   The official said requests for U.S. posts abroad to increase
their state of readiness at such times are normal practice.
   Redman said Iran had been warned four times about mining in gulf
waters since last July when a reflagged Kuwaiti vessel, the
Bridgeton, struck a mine near Farsi Island. He said other warnings
followed in September and October.
   The note to Iran said that despite these warnings and the fact
that U.S. forces in the gulf have not threatened Iranian forces,
Iran ``has persisted in this illegal and reckless conduct.''
   Redman said the message was sent to Iranian authorities through
the Swiss, which handles U.S. interests in Iran in the absence of
diplomatic relations between the two countries.

<HEAD>Outback Hippies Find Other Uses for Cane Toads</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto SYD-1</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Hippies in Australia's outback are
forsaking traditional drugs and getting their kicks from cane
toads, which when boiled produce a slimy and potentially lethal
cocktail, police say.
   ``People taking it experience a trip similar to that resulting
from LSD,'' said Inspector Syd Churchill of Cairns Police in
northeast Australia. ``It is, by all accounts, a very potent drug.''
   Churchill told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that cane
toads, which are reviled across Australia for their ugly
appearance, are being cooked by drug users because they are
plentiful while narcotics like marijuana and heroin are in short
supply or expensive.
   ``The preparation method involves boiling toads in a billy (a
pot) for a few minutes. The toads are then removed, and the
somewhat treacly substance behind is drunk,'' said Churchill.
   But he warned that bufotenine, the substance contained in two
glands behind the toad's head, is a toxin that can be fatal.
   Churchill did not mention if the practice is widespread, nor
whether there had been any arrests or fatalities. Cairns police
said he was not available for comment Monday.
   However, an expert in cane toads, Dr. Robert Endean of
Queensland University's zoology department, said he was aware 10
years ago that people in the outback were getting high from chewing
or smoking cane toad skins.
   ``It is definitely hallucinogenic,'' Endean told The Associated
Press. ``It makes a good cocktail. But the toad is so ugly I would
have thought just to look at it is enough to make most people think
`I'll give that a miss.'''
   The size of dinner plates, cane toads were introduced to
Australia from South America about 50 years ago to control a beetle
plague in the Queensland canefields. They are now found across
northeastern Australia.

   American industry had a second straight
monthly decline in operating rates in March despite a rebound at
auto plants, the government reported Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said U.S. factories, mines and utilities
operated at 82.3 percent of capacity last month, down from an
operating rate of 82.4 percent in February.
   U.S. factories had operated at 82.6 percent of capacity in
January, the highest level in more than eight years.
   Analysts said the small declines in the operating level over the
past two months were not worrisome and represented cutbacks in
industries trying to work down high levels of unsold goods.
   Before the year began, economists had been worried that sharp
production cutbacks could topple the country into a new recession.
But those fears have now faded as a variety of economic indicators
have shown the economy performing better-than-expected so far this
year.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., predicted
the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
would expand at a respectable annual rate of around 2 percent in
the January-March quarter.
   She said many industries, such as paper and chemicals, have been
expanding their production facilities to meet increased demand and
this higher spending will help boost overall GNP growth this year
as well as helping to hold down inflationary pressures.
   ``The added manufacturing capacity is needed if we are to keep
price pressures from developing in the economy,'' she said.
   In March, the operating rate at auto factories shot up to 79.2
percent of capacity, the first increase in this key sector since
October. Analysts credited the gain to the success auto dealers had
in spurring sales through the use of new incentives programs.
   In manufacturing overall, the operating rate edged down to 82.5
percent, a dip of 0.1 percentage point from February as strength in
autos was offset by cutbacks at factories making nondurable goods.
   The operating rate at plants making durable goods, items
expected to last at least three years, rose to 80.2 percent, up 0.1
percentage point, reflecting the auto rebound.
   Plants making nondurable goods, however, operated at 85.9
percent of capacity, down from 86.2 percent in capacity.
   The mining industry, which includes oil and gas drilling,
operated at 80.3 percent of capacity, up from 79.8 percent in
February. U.S. utilities operated at 81.8 percent of capacity, down
0.1 percent from February.
   The overall operating rate of 82.3 percent was up sharply from a
year ago, when American industry was operating at 79.7 percent of
capacity.
   The growth over the past year reflects heavy overseas demand for
U.S. products because of the decline in the value of the dollar.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some banks opened for the first time
in six weeks Monday, but only to accept deposits, and people who
still have currency in this cash-poor economy were in no rush to
give it up.
   Business was brisk at a few major foreign banks, but slow at
institutions owned and operated by Panamanians.
   About 30 people were outside Chase Manhattan when it opened.
Virtually all were depositing checks they have been unable to cash
for 45 days because U.S. economic sanctions have dried up the money
supply in Panama, whose currency is the dollar.
   ``I'll keep my cash at home,'' said Frank Farrell, who is
retired and was depositing several dividend checks.``Later on,
maybe I'll deposit cash.''
   Asked if he felt secure putting checks in a bank that had been
closed since March 4 by order of an insolvent government, Farrell
replied: ``I don't worry. Chase is solid.''
   The banks were closed after Panamanians began withdrawing large
sums of money on Feb. 26. That was the day Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the real power in Panama, dismissed civilian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle for trying to fire him as commander of the
armed forces and police.
   The Reagan administration subsequently ordered the Federal
Reserve to halt the flow of dollars to Panama. Lawyers acting for
Delvalle were able to freeze Panamanian funds in U.S. banks.
   Washington also has imposed other economic sanctions on Panama
in an effort to out Noriega, who is under indictment in U.S.
federal courts on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
He denies the charges.
   A middle-aged woman in line at the Chase office said she was
depositing only checks because ``I need the cash to eat.''
   Short lines lines also formed outside Citibank and the Bank of
America but Panamanian-owned banks, whose solvency is in question,
did not appear even to be getting many checks for deposit.
   A few minutes after it opened, only six customers were in the
spacious lobby of the National Bank of Panama, largest of the
locally owned banks.
   The Panamanian Banking Association says its members will not
resume full service until the government can assure a steady,
adequate supply of dollars. Most of the more than 120 banks doing
business in Panama belong to the association.
   Since the banks closed, Panama has operated on a cash-only basis
and the government has been able to make only partial salary
payments to employees.
   Only banks licensed to provide full services were included in
the Banking Commission's reopening order. Many foreign banks accept
checking, savings and time deposits and provide fund transfers, but
do not make loans or offer other banking services.
   One bank manager said privately the reopening for deposits only
would ``reestablish the check as an acceptable payment'' in lieu of
dollars.
   ``Panama is a check economy, if you want to use that word,'' he
said. ``This is an initial step to reestablish the reopening of
banks ... but I really don't know if this is going to work or not.''
   He said clients depositing checks would not be able to draw cash
from their accounts until or unless the banks resume full services,
``but if you owe money to somebody and he will accept a check, you
can write a check on your new balance.''

   Two Iranian navy frigates were attacked and
disabled today by American forces and four smaller gunboats either
sunk or damaged in a wave of fighting across the lower half of the
Persian Gulf, the Pentagon said.
   No American injuries or fatalities were reported, but Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said a Cobra attack helicopter with two
crewmen aboard was late in returning to a Navy cruiser and that a
search had been mounted for the aircraft.
   The naval action with Iran began when U.S. warships attacked and
destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for last week's
mining of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts.
   Carlucci, appearing at his second press briefing of the day,
described as ``foolhardy behavior'' Iran's decision to escalate the
fighting today. He said he assumed the attacks could only be
explained as stemming from fanaticism.
   Earlier today, Carlucci and other Pentagon officials disclosed
that an Iranian patrol boat had been sunk after firing a missile at
the cruiser Wainwright, and that two Iranian navy frigates had been
attacked and disabled after firing on U.S. aircraft.
   During his second briefing, Carlucci announced that a Navy A-6
Intruder jet had sunk at least one and possibly three small Iranian
gunboats after observing them attack commercial vessels and oil
rigs off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.
   That confrontation occurred around 7:30 a.m. EDT, Carlucci said,
or about 6{ hours after U.S. forces attacked the Iranian offshore
platforms.
   Navy jets were assigned to patrol the area after reports were
received indicating an American commercial boat, the Willy Tide,
had been attacked, Carlucci indicated.
   The defense secretary described the U.S. attack on the platforms
as a ``measured response'' given available evidence proving Iran
had sown a new minefield in the gulf last week.
   All of the fighting that occurred after the attacks on the
offshore platforms was in the cause of American self-defense,
Carlucci said.
   Asked if he were surprised by the Iranian decision to confront
U.S. forces directly, the secretary replied: ``I wouldn't use the
word surprised because the Iranians have been known to engage in
this kind of, frankly, foolhardy behavior before.
   ``I might say we were disappointed. We hoped that they would
heed the warnings that we gave. But when they did not, we took
appropriate action.''
   Asked how he would explain Iran's decision to ignore U.S.
warnings, he said: ``I'm not sure that it's explainable in terms of
Western logic at this point. I have to only assume that it's some
kind of a fanatical reaction or slavish obedience to a contingency
plan.
   ``It certainly makes no sense whatsoever in military terms. And
we hope that tomorrow that will bring peace in the region.''
   The Pentagon said the missing American helicopter had been on a
routine surveillance mission from the cruiser Wainwright in the
lower central gulf, and that there was no indication the aircraft
had become involved in hostile action. As of 3:30 p.m. EDT,
Carlucci said, the helicopter was about 40 minutes overdue and
efforts to establish radio contact had been unsuccessful.
   The Pentagon said it had launched a search-and-rescue mission,
but had not spotted the helicopter.
   Earlier, the Pentagon said the two Iranian frigates had been
attacked and disabled after firing missiles at U.S. jets flying
overhead.
   The Defense Department said the last of those confrontations
ccurred around 9:40 a.m. EDT, when a frigate identified as the
Sabalan fired on A-6 Intruder attack jets from the carrier
Enterprise.
   ``The aircraft returned fire and hit the Sabalan with a single
laser-guided bomb,'' the Pentagon added.
   ``As darkness fell, the Sabalan was down by the stern with tugs
fore and aft. We do not intend to renew attacks on the Sabalan
unless she exhibits further hostile intent.''
   The fight with the Sabalan came just 70 minutes after a similar
confrontation with an identical frigate named the Sahand. It also
was attacked and set afire after firing missiles at the U.S.
aircraft, the Pentagon said.
   The confrontation with the Sahand occurred in the Strait of
Hormuz, the entrance to the Persian Gulf, around 8:30 a.m. EDT,
about 7{ hours after the United States bombarded and destroyed two
Iranian offshore platforms, said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief
spokesman.
   Earlier, an Iranian patrol boat was sunk after advancing on U.S.
warships; an American helicopter came under fire from another
gunboat, and one U.S. warship fired on two approaching Iranian jet
fighters, although it was unclear whether they were hit.
   Howard gave this account of the Sahand incident:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian frigate, a 310-foot warship named the Sahand,
steamed out of the naval base at Bandar Abbas earlier this morning
and ``was noticed closing rapidly upon three U.S. warships.''
   ``The Sahand ignored repeated warnings from a U.S. E-2
(early-warning) aircraft to turn away or to be considered hostile.
About 8:30 a.m. (EDT), the Sahand fired upon three A-6 Intruder
aircraft on patrol in the area off the USS Enterprise.
   ``The Intruders returned fire with two Harpoon missiles and a
number of laser-guided bombs. Shortly thereafter, the USS Strauss,
a destroyer, engaged the Sahand with an additional Harpoon. All the
ordnance appears to have hit the frigate and it's heavily damaged.
   ``It's on fire at the moment and the smoke is so heavy that it's
difficult to do a further assessment at this point.''
   Howard added that the Strauss had been patrolling the area in
and around the Strait of Hormuz along with two other ships, the
destroyer O'Brien and the frigate Jack Williams.
   Neither the A-6 attack jets nor the U.S. warships sustained any
damage and there were no reports of any American injuries or
casualties, the spokesman said.
   Howard revealed the battle with the Sahand this morning a bit
more than an hour after Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
appeared at an early-morning briefing to discuss the U.S. attacks.
   The destruction of the two Iranian offshore platforms was
ordered by President Reagan on Sunday night in retaliation for the
mine strike that almost sank the frigate Samuel B. Roberts last
week, Carlucci said.
   Carlucci said there was no doubt the mine field in which the
Roberts became entrapped had been laid recently by Iran. Mines
discovered in the area carry the same type of serial numbers as
those captured last year aboard an Iranian mine-laying ship,
Carlucci said.
   According to Carlucci and Crowe, today's operation began around
1 a.m. EDT with two groups of Navy warships attacking two oil
platforms in the central Persian Gulf.
   Both of the platforms were ultimately destroyed _ one by naval
gunfire and the other by planted explosives, the two said.
   But in the process of attacking one of the platforms, the
so-called Sassan platform, the U.S. ships came under fire from a
machine gun on the facility, Crowe said.
   And immediately after the attack on the second platform, the
Sirri platform, an Iranian patrol boat roughly 150 feet in length
began advancing on the three American warships and ignored warnings
to keep its distance, the admiral continued.
   ``It (the Iranian boat) acknowledged the message but continued
to close,'' Crowe said. ``After several warnings, we engaged and he
fired at us simultaneously with a missile.
   ``The Simpson fired three Standard missiles, two of which hit
the (Iranian vessel). The Wainwright fired one, which hit the
(Iranian). We subsequently closed on it and fired another missile
and it sunk. We found no people in the water.''

<HEAD>Moslem Holy Month Observed Throughout Arab World</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hijack, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The start of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan was observed in
many parts of the Arab world Monday, including on the Iran-Iraq
battlefields and inside the cabin of the hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet
in Algeria.
   King Hassan II of Morocco, however, granted a dispensation from
the traditional fast to those Moslems involved in the fight against
the swarms of locusts invading North Africa.
   Ramadan, the ninth month of the Moslem lunar calendar, began
Monday in some parts of the world and on Sunday in other areas. The
traditional beginning depends on a sighting of the new moon.
   During Ramadan, observant Moslems are required to abstain from
food, drink and tobacco during daylight hours. At sunset they eat
their ``fotour,'' an exotic meal with special drinks and many
courses.
   On Sunday in Algiers, Algeria, the hijackers holding a Kuwait
Airways jetliner with about 35 people aboard asked for a special
meal for themselves and their captives before the beginning of
Ramadan. The Algerians delivered ``souhour,'' the traditional meal
of fermented cheese and dates.
   After sunset Monday, the plane radioed its first request of the
day for food. Forty packets were then hoisted up the side of the
Boeing 747 with knotted tablecloths.
   The hijackers had asked several times by radio beginning
Saturday when Ramadan would commence this year.
   In Kuwait, the emir and the crown prince canceled traditional
receptions marking Islam's holiest month out of respect for the
Kuwaiti hostages aboard the jet, newspapers reported.
   In Iran, the Interior Ministry issued a command for persons who
are exempt from fasting _ non-Moslems, soldiers in battle, sick and
very young people, travelers and pregnant women _ not to eat in
public. Restaurants are banned from serving food and drink during
the fasting hours from sunrise to sunset.
   During the 7-year-old war with Iran, Iraq has offered temporary
truces during the holy month, citing Moslem injunctions that it is
particularly sinful for Moslems to kill Moslems during Ramadan.
Iran has refused each year.
   This year, the Iraqis used Ramadan to motivate their troops,
dubbing their offensive in the Faw Peninsula the ``Blessed Ramadan
Operation.''
   In his announcement for those fighting the war against the
swarms of locusts, King Hassan stressed that civil defense workers
and airplane crews ``are acting in the same way as the soldiers
stationed on our borders who are watching over the security and
interests of the nation.''
   Several years ago, the king also exempted soliders fighting
against Polisario guerrillas in the former Spanish Sahara from the
daytime fasting obligations.

   Two bomb blasts on Monday wrecked
a Jewish community center and a Saudi Arabian airlines office, and
authorities looked into a possible link with the weekend
assassination of a senior PLO leader.
   No one was injured in the early morning blasts in Frankfurt, and
no one claimed responsibility.
   Police said the devices, which went off about 15 minutes apart
within a mile of each other, probably were planted by the same
attackers. Frankfurt prosecutor's spokesman Jochen Schroers said
that ``evidence at both sites is similar.''
   He said a connection with Saturday's slaying of the Palestine
Liberation Organization miliary chief in Tunisia ``is just
speculation at this point.''
   ``But a connection is possible,'' he added. ``Such a political
motive can't be ruled out.''
   Khalil al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was killed early
Saturday by commandos who stormed his suburban Tunis home. The PLO,
a Tunisian government panel, and Israeli press reports have said
Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has remained silent.
   A leading member of the opposition Social Democratic Party also
discussed the possibility of a link between the slaying and the
Frankfurt blasts in an interview Monday with Saarland state radio.
   However, Hans Koschink said there were no ``clear signs'' of
such a connection.
   The head of West Germany's Jewish Communities, Heinz Galinski,
issued a statement Monday in West Berlin calling on authorities to
tighten security near Jewish property.
   ``It is not understandable for me that even today _ especially
in view of the increasing number of threatening and abusive letters
_ Jewish communities have difficulty when they try to get
sufficient security for their property,'' Galinski said.
   Meanwhile, police looked for a silver-gray BMW car that
witnesses saw before the blast at the Jewish Community Center, a
police spokesman said, requesting anonymity.
   The blast at the center blew off outdoor lighting fixtures,
badly damaged the front entrance, and left a foot-deep hole in the
ground.
   The explosion at the Saudi airlines office gutted the interior
and shattered windows in nearby buildings, including at the Air
Canada office.
   Authorities estimated overall damage at several hundred thousand
dollars.

   Here are highlights from the report by the
President's Commission on Aviation Safety:
   _ The nation's air transportation system is ``safe, for now,''
but the government regulatory structure ``designed to ensure
aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and
technological change.''
   _ There is a need for ``a major structural overhaul'' of the
Federal Aviation Administration, making it an independent agency
outside the Transportation Department.
   _ An independent aviation ``safety czar'' should be appointed as
part of the new FAA and given authority to oversee safety matters.
With a seven-year term, the new aviation safety director could
initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations.
   _ No need has been demonstrated for re-imposing federal
regulation of the airline industry, although the government must
streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing
events in a deregulated industry.
   _ Surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier
reliance on in-depth inspections, surprise inspections and closer
examination of airlines undergoing major changes.
   _ Safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated
gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines.
   _ Small private planes flying near major airports should be
required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their
altitude.

<HEAD>Teen Goes On Spending Spree At Resort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCEAN CITY, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who got a bad report card
took $74,000 from his parents, ran away to this seaside resort and
went on a spending spree in an $800 a day stretch limousine, police
said.
   The 15-year-old runaway had just over $53,000 left when he was
apprehended Saturday evening at a go-cart track in West Ocean City,
police said Monday.
   The boy left his suburban Pittsburgh home Tuesday with $74,000
in a cardboard box, State Police Cpl. Harry Edwards said. His
father was described as a self-employed businessman who often kept
cash at home.
   The teen-ager then hopped a bus to Ocean City and checked into a
motel where rooms cost $32 to $34 a night.
   He quickly made friends, and together they rented a limousine
for two days from Resort Transportation Co. A clerk said the boys
had the driver take them shopping.
   ``They thought they'd get some high fashion,'' said Edwards.
``They bought up a lot of jewelry at stores on the Boardwalk. You
know, necklaces, watches, bracelets. But they had no taste in
jewelry. ... They even had a knock-off Rolex watch. It said Rolex
on the front, and on the back, in ink that rubs off, it said
Taiwan.''
   The boys ate mostly in pizza joints, ``and everywhere they went,
they tipped, they tipped well,'' Edwards said.
   ``He was very nice. ... No one here suspected anything,'' said
motel clerk Vontina Collick.
   The spree came to an end after the boy's parents learned of his
whereabouts and contacted state police. Police also were alerted by
someone who found the teen-ager's spending habits unusual.
   The boy was released to his mother Sunday afternoon.
   Police also arrested Eric Deshawn Faulkner, 20, of Ocean City
and charged him with stealing $2,500 from the runaway, Edwards
said. Police were searching for a third suspect who allegedly took
a handful of money from the box during a party in the motel, police
said.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Dukakis Would Be Smart to Support Reagan in Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Nixon advised Democrat Michael Dukakis
on Monday to back President Reagan on America's retaliatory actions
in the Persian Gulf to dispel any impression that he is weak on
foreign policy.
   He said, also, that the United States should make clear to
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev that ``the Russians are playing
Russian Roulette with the situation there.''
   President Reagan should make it clear to the Soviets, who he
said are playing on both sides in the war between Iran and Iraq,
that ``this is an area we consider absolutely vital and that
eventually they are going to hurt their relations with us unless
they join us in trying to get this war brought to an end,'' Nixon
said.
   Nixon described the conflict as ``not a war that we want either
side to win'' and added: ``There has never been a war in which both
sides deserved to lose more than this war.''
   Incidents in the Persian Gulf have the effect of strengthening
the candidacy of Vice President George Bush, Nixon said, adding
that if he were Dukakis ``I would take a hard line on this.''
   ``When the United States comes under attack and they (the
people) realize our interests are involved, they rally around the
president and his vice president, in this case,'' the former
president said.
   ``I don't think George Bush is going to make a political issue
out of this and that is why I think Dukakis ought ... to join the
president and George Bush in making it clear to the Iranians they
are confronting a united United States on this issue and that we're
not going to be divided.''
   Dukakis said Monday, ``We just don't have sufficient information
for me to comment on what's happened in the Middle East in the last
few days and it would just be inappropriate for me to comment.''
   Nixon's interview, on CNN, was one of a series of appearances he
is making to promote his new book, ``1999.''
   He said Dukakis would be helped by taking a strong line in the
Persian Gulf conflict ``because he opposed the move even into
Grenada.''
   The former president, who has predicted that Republican Bush
will beat Democrat Dukakis by a narrow margin in November, said
that what he called Dukakis' weakness in foreign policy has not
been brought out ``due to the fact that everybody is concentrating
on Jesse Jackson at the moment because of his spectacularly
successful campaign.''
   As he has before, Nixon described Dukakis' foreign policy as
``right out of George McGovern's playbook.''
   ``If people get the idea that you are going to have a president
who is smart, tough, strong _ which he is _ but is weak in the
foreign policy area, it will be devastating to him. I think it will
serve his interest in this case to support the president.''

<HEAD>Cuba To Allow Prisoners and Families To Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba has given exit permits to 225 former or
current political prisoners and their families, and a portion of
the group is expected to fly to the United States this week, the
State Department said Monday.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said this represents about one-eighth
of the more than 2,000 persons whom the U.S. has authorized for
entry into the United States as refugees.
   Another official, asking not to be identified, said the initial
group is due to arrive in Miami on Wednesday and is expected to
number about 25 persons. The remainder will fly to Miami over the
next several weeks.
   Consistent with past practice, Cuba is likely to send the
emigres in small groups in order to limit opportunities for
propaganda spectacles by exile groups or by the Reagan
administration, the official said.
   Redman said the 225 had been processed for emigration by the
U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana last August from a list drawn up
by the U.S. Catholic Conference. The list was later amended by the
Cuban government, he said.
   Of the 91 in the prisoner category, 22 are long-term inmates who
have refused political rehabilitation.
   The expected departure of the first group of Cubans coincides
with the arrival in Cuba this week of Cardinal John O'Connor, the
archbishop of New York City.
   He is believed to be the highest ranking American Roman Catholic
official to travel to Cuba since the 1959 revolution.
   The U.S. official said there has been speculation but no firm
evidence that the Cuban decision to allow the emigres to leave the
island was linked to O'Connor's visit. He is going to Cuba after a
visit to the Dominican Republic.

<HEAD>World Wildlife Fund Urges Denial Of Michigan Panda Permit
Application</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed exhibition in Michigan of two giant
pandas from China would undermine international laws governing
imports of endangered species, the World Wildlife Fund said Monday
in urging denial of an import permit.
   However, Michigan United Conservation Clubs, an exhibition
sponsor, said the permit may be unnecessary because Chinese
officials have agreed to provide pandas exempt from a treaty
governing endangered-species imports.
   The World Wildlife Fund, a private organization seeking to
preserve wild animals, said in a letter to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service: ``The imported wildlife will be used for
commercial purposs, and the import will neither serve scientific
purposes nor enhance the propagation or survival of the species.''
   Such use of the pandas would violate both U.S. endangered
species laws and the Convention on International Trade of
Endangered Species, the letter said.
   Evidence of poaching of the rare giant panda in China prompted
the World Wildlife Fund to oppose the Michigan exhibition, said
William Reilly, the organization's president.
   ``Had we known a year ago what we have learned in the past few
months about the plight of the panda and the pressure posed by
exhibition loans, we almost certainly would have opposed most, if
not all, previous short-term loans just as rigorously,'' Reilly
said.
   Reilly said approval of the permit would increase the demand for
the import of giant pandas into the United States for commercial
purposes.
   Tom Washington, MUCC executive director, denied the exhibition
was commercial. ``Certainly, we are not a circus, or a carnival, or
even a zoo, for that matter,'' he said. ``There is a whole string
of hypocricy involved here.''
   MUCC received a letter over the weekend from Sichuan Province's
foreign affairs office providing assurance that ``they will provide
us with a pair of pandas born before 1984,'' Washington said. The
animals would not require an import permit, he said.
   The exhibitors of the pandas in Michigan would pay Chinese
authorities at least $300,000, with the money to be used to build a
panda captive-breeding facility and to improve the animals'
habitat, Washington said.
   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and MUCC in
February asked the Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the pandas
shown at a 100-day summer exhibition, called Pandarama, at the
Michigan State Fairgrounds in Detroit.

<HEAD>South African General Describes South African Role In Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breaking a long official
silence, the armed forces chief on Monday gave details of his
troops' role in Angola and said Angola had exaggerated the size of
the South African force operating there.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, in his first detailed statement on South
Africa's involvement in Angola's civil war, said there had never
been more than 3,000 South African troopers in Angola at any one
time in the past year.
   Angola's Marxist government claims there are 9,000 South African
military personnel fighting alongside rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
   There are an estimated 40,000 Cuban soldiers and hundreds of
Soviet advisers in Angola helping the government forces.
   Geldenhuys announced last November that South African troops had
intervened on behalf of UNITA. Since then, the military has been
widely criticized for providing minimal information about its role
in the war.
   The general's statement Monday indicated the intervention began
in May 1987, since the losses he announced were for a period
beginning then.
   In the months since, Geldenhuys said, 31 South African soldiers
have been killed and three tanks, four other combat vehicles and
two aircraft have been lost.
   The casualty figures did not include black units composed of
South-West Africans and Angolan exiles. There have been unofficial
reports that those units have suffered higher losses than white
South African units.
   Geldenhuys did not give casualty figures for the UNITA rebels.
He said Angolan government losses for the past year totaled 4,768
men, but it was not clear if the losses referred to the number
killed or both killed and wounded.
   The general repeated a statement he made in December that South
African forces were in the process of withdrawing. He declined to
report a timetable, saying such information could aid the enemy.
   He said the South African troops had captured certain weapons
``unknown to the Western world'' and several countries were seeking
access to them. He did not elaborate.
   Angola's foreign minister, Alfredo Van Dunem, said Friday more
than 6,000 South African soldiers were preparing for a renewed
attack against the strategic southern town of Cuito Cuanavale.
   He said the troops beseiging the garrison town were part of a
South African force of 9,000 soldiers, 600 artillery pieces and 500
tanks and armored cars in Angola.
   Cuito Cuanavale has been under attack for four months by UNITA
rebels and South African troops.
   The town is 190 miles north of the border with South
African-ruled South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. It has an
airstrip and is used as a staging base for army operations against
UNITA guerrillas.
   UNITA lost to the Marxist Popular Liberation Movement of Angola
in a battle for power after Angola received its independence from
Portugal in November 1975.
   UNITA, which is suported by the United States, is demanding the
Marxists share power.
   The government has rejected negotiations with the rebels. It has
said it would agree to a gradual withdrawal of the Cuban troops if
South Africa removed its forces and halted aid to UNITA.

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett
charged Monday that recent changes in its Western culture course
requirements at Stanford University represented a victory for
radical students who employed ``the tactics of intimidation.''
   ``A great university was brought low by the very forces which
modern universities came into being to oppose _ ignorance,
irrationality and intimidation,'' Bennett charged in a speech
prepared for delivery on the Stanford campus in California.
   Stanford President Donald Kennedy denied Bennett's allegations
and accused Bennett of using ``his bully pulpit to bully rather
than to engage the issues.''
   Kennedy said Bennett had refused an offer to debate with
university officials and insisted instead on having ``a platform to
speak unopposed.''
   Among the sponsors of Bennett's speech were the Stanford
Conservative Forum and the Stanford College Republicans.
   Stanford's Black Student Union, feminists and other minority
student groups had agitated for changes in the Western culture
requirement.
   Stanford's faculty senate voted 39-4 on March 31 to alter its
Western culture requirement for freshman to include the study of
non-European cultures and works by women and minorities. They also
renamed the requirement, effective in the fall of 1989, ``Cultures,
Ideas and Values.''
   Freshmen entering this fall still will have to read from the Old
and New Testaments and works by Plato, Augustine, Machiavelli,
Rousseau and Marx. But works by Dante, Luther, Locke, Freud,
Voltaire, Darwin, Nieztsche and several others have been dropped
from the core list.
   Starting in 1989, the Cultures, Ideas and Values faculty will
decide which texts, authors, themes and issues will be taught in
six to 10 different tracks.
   The faculty senate decided that each track must include works
from at least one non-European culture and confront ``issues
relating to class, ethnicity, race, religion, gender and sexual
orientation.'' Students will have at least one major reading each
quarter on race, gender or class issues.
   In a related matter, the chancellor of the University of
Massachusetts on Monday lashed back at Bennett, who had accused the
school of being too lenient in handling a protest by minority
students.
   ``Students here were treated with respect but also firmness,''
Chancellor Joseph Duffey said. ``They left the building because
they were treated with respect, not because they got what they
wanted.''
   Minority students took over a campus building at UMass for six
days in February to protest campus racism, and Bennett on Sunday
complained that administrators sent ``the demonstrators a basket of
fruit and ordered out Chinese food for them and then gave in to all
of their demands ... one wonders what kind of teaching experience
that is.''
   Bennett previously had injected himself into the debate at
Stanford in February, when he said that ``faculty trashing of Plato
and Shakespeare'' was eroding the credibility of higher education.
   Kennedy said in an interview after he read the advance text of
the speech that the faculty had made ``a significant improvement''
in the curriculum and that Bennett obviously had not followed the
controversy very carefully.
   ``I don't believe he can possibly have read the ultimate
compromise carefully or read the arguments in the debate that led
up to it,'' Bennett said.
   ``I'm disappointed that people on both sides of the original
debate won't have a chance to respond,'' Kennedy said. ``But I
certainly hope they will respond in other forums.''
   Kennedy said the faculty ``has made the core list more flexible
and it has introduced some notion of comparative analysis into that
curriculum.''
   But Bennett said that even though some may portray the new
requirement as ``a minor pedagogical change ... the fact is that
the core reading list of 15 significant works in Western philosophy
and literature has been thrown out.''
   Instead, instructors will decide year by year what the course
content will be, he said. ``Does anyone doubt that selecting works
based on ethnicity or gender of their authors trivializes the
academic enterprise?'' Bennett asked.
   He said ``the tactics of intimidation'' had brought about the
changes.
   ``The loudest voices have won, not through force of argument,
but through bullying, threatening and name-calling. That's not the
way a university should work,'' Bennett said.

   Here, at a glance, are Monday's developments in the Persian Gulf:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MANAMA, Bahrain _ American forces destroyed two of Iran's
Persian Gulf oil platforms, sank or damaged four attack boats and
disabled two frigates that fired missiles at American planes. Iran
responded with attacks on Arab oil facilities; U.S., British and
Cypriot commercial vessels, and a press helicopter chartered by NBC.

   WASHINGTON _ No American casualties were reported, but Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said a Cobra attack helicopter with two
crewmen was late in returning to a Navy cruiser and a search had
begun.

   NICOSIA, Cyprus _ Iran said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
wrote a protest letter to U.S. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar that said, in part: ``Iran will never submit to the policy
of violence and intimidation, and will definitely respond to the
cowardly U.S. attacks.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Washington said destruction of the oil platforms
was a ``measured response'' to the explosion of a mine, allegedly
planted by Iran, that damaged an American frigate last week and
wounded 10 sailors. President Reagan said: ``We will protect our
ships and, if they threaten us, they'll pay a price. We undertook
this action to make sure the Iranians have no illusions about the
cost of irresponsible behavior.''
</TEXT>

   MANAMA _ In the ground war between Iran and Iraq, the Iraqis
claimed to have regained most of the southern Faw peninsula Iranian
forces captured more than two years ago, including the town of Faw.
Iran said U.S. helicopter gunships fired at Iranian troops and
``American forces have entered the war,'' but the United States
denied it.

<HEAD>Former Venezuelan President Tells of Past Agreement for Noriega to
Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega had
signed an agreement to leave power voluntarily in May, it was
disclosed Monday, but the deal fell through when Panama's president
tried to fire the general in February.
   The report came from former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez, who said he negotiated the deal with Noriega together with
former presidents Alfonso Lopez Michelsen of Colombia and Daniel
Oduber of Costa Rica.
   Perez said in an interview the U.S. government was aware of his
group's negotiations with Noriega, which took place in Panama last
November and in January and February of this year.
   The deal was signed Feb. 24, three weeks after Noriega was
indicted on drug charges in Miami and one day before Panama's
then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle announced he was firing him.
Instead, Noriega engineered Delvalle's removal from the presidency.
   The former Venezuelan president said negotiations with Noriega
had been undertaken ``to help lead Panama back toward democracy,''
and had the support of the United States and Spain.
   He said Spain's Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez knew of the
initiative and indicated Noriega could come to Spain after leaving
Panama.
   The deal with Noriega envisioned his resignation from command of
the National Guard, Panama's politically powerful army, and his
replacment ``by an officer removed from politics, whose mission
would be the preservation of public order under civilian control.''
Concurrently, steps would be taken to prepare for free elections
and to restore full freedom of expression.
   Perez said Noriega's departure from Panama was not part of the
deal, but ``would have been a natural outgrowth of the process.
Once he was out of the guard, it was inevitable that he would have
to leave the country.''
   ``Initially,'' Perez said, ``we were told by the United States
that Noriega could come here (to the United States). We had no idea
that a criminal investigation and indictment were in the works.''
   Perez, who has been meeting with bankers and business leaders in
the United States, is a candidate for the presidency of Venezuela
in elections to be held in November. He served as president from
1974 to 1979.
   Perez said ``news of Noriega's removal came as a complete
surprise to us,'' and ``apparently followed'' a meeting between
Delvalle and the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, Elliott Abrams. He said the move came just
as he and his fellow negotiators were preparing to report the
signing of the agreement with Noriega to Secretary of State George
P. Shultz.
   Perez said the agreement had been intended to remain
confidential, but the need for secrecy disappeared once the
circumstances in Panama changed. He said he mentioned its existence
in a statement issued in Caracas in February, but it gained little
attention at the time.

<HEAD>Western Chairmen Meet With Reagan, Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Party chairmen from 18 Western
states met with Vice President George Bush on Monday to urge him to
select a Westerner as his running mate.
   The chairmen met with Bush over breakfast and with President
Reagan during lunch to discuss GOP politics in the West.
   T. J. Baily, Oregon GOP chairman, said he and others told Bush
he could strengthen his ticket in the West if he picked a Western
vice presidential candidate.
   ``Bush said he did not have a short list or a long list of
possible running mates,'' said Baily, adding that Bush indicated it
may be difficult to select a running mate on a regional basis only.
   Baily said that although Reagan and other GOP presidential
candidates have done well in the West in recent elections, ``we
can't take anything for granted. The West could be the difference
in winning this time.''

<HEAD>Congress Should Repeal Law Requiring Timber Production, GAO Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf pvs, bgng: ``The Tongass ...'' to identify
Idaho forest.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should repeal the money-losing law
that requires the U.S. Forest Service to market a minimum supply of
timber from Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the General
Accounting Office said Monday.
   GAO, the investigative wing of Congress, said the requirement
contributed to a net loss by taxpayers of about $22.1 million in
1986 in sales of commercial timber from the Tongass, the nation's
largest national forest.
   A 1980 law requires that the Forest Service offer to sell at
least 4.5 billion board feet of Tongass timber each decade and
guarantees at least $40 million in spending a year to support the
sales program.
   The Tongass is the only national forest with a minimum sales
goal set by law, although Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, has proposed
a similar guarantee for the Panhandle National Forest in his state.
   Last month, the House Interior Committee approved legislation to
repeal the guaranteed minimum sales offerings from the Tongass. A
similar bill is pending in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   The proposals are being pushed by environmental and conservation
groups who say the guarantee leads to unnecessary roadbuilding by
the Forest Service and needless harvesting of 400-year-old trees.
   The GAO study, requested by Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis., and
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said that sales offerings of timber from the
forest should be subject to market supply-and-demand forces.
   GAO said that from 1981 through 1986, the last year for which
data were available, sales of Tongass timber averaged 245 million
board feet a year, some 105 million below the yearly average needed
to meet the 10-year goal.
   Focusing on 1986, GAO said the Forest Service spent $47.9
million on the Tongass and realized only $3.3 million in revenues.
The net loss to taxpayers was $22.1 million because some spending
was for timber production in future years, according to the study.
   From 1981 through 1986, the Forest Service spent $131 million to
prepare for timber sales that were not needed to meet demand, the
study said.
   GAO said that because of the guarantee ``the Forest Service has
incurred substantial expenses to prepare and offer timber it could
not sell under depressed market conditions and made added
investments in timber not needed to meet this demand. ...
   ``We think clarifications and fundamental changes are
necessary,'' said GAO, noting that demand for Tongass timber has
not met the projections made when the 1980 law was enacted.
   ``The timber supply provision should be revised so that the
amount supplied would be based on the anticipated demand for timber
and on the data currently being formulated by the Forest Service
... rather than on a rigid per-decade requirement,'' the study said.
   One reason given by advocates of the guarantee was to ensure
employment in Southeast Alaska following passage of the 1980 law,
which barred commercial activities in about one-third of the 16.8
million acre Tongass.
   GAO said Tongass-related timber jobs declined from 2,700 in 1980
to 1,420 in 1986 ``primarily because of the decreased harvest
levels resulting from declining demand for timber and increased
production by the Alaska native corporations that directly compete
with the Tongass timber industry.''
   The Forest Service chief, F. Dale Robertson, said in a letter to
GAO that the proposal to scrap the Tongass guarantee ``has merit.''
   Stevens said in a prepared statement that the GAO focused on a
low-demand portion of an economic cycle and that timber has since
rebounded. He said money must be spent on the Tongass even in low
periods in order to meet peak demand.
   He also noted that the guaranteed timber offerings were part of
the 1980 compromise with conservation groups that set aside 5.4
million acres of the forest as protected wilderness.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III appeared for
four hours before a federal grand jury Monday in the criminal
investigation of his activities that began nearly a year ago.
   It was his fifth grand jury appearance in the probe by
independent counsel James McKay since coming under criminal
investigation last May 11.
   Meese's attorneys, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, said in a
statement that the attorney general ``answered all questions'' and
they said they remain confident that Meese won't be indicted and
that the probe will be completed ``in the near future.''
   McKay has been delving into a $40,000-a-year job for Meese's
wife, Meese's involvement with a $1-billion Iraqi oil pipeline, the
attorney general's ownership of $14,000 in regional Bell Telephone
stock and Meese's ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   The attorney general's most recent grand jury appearance in the
McKay probe was last Nov. 4, when prosecutors from McKay's office
were focusing on the Wedtech matter.
   Last Thursday, two members of the family that arranged to pay
the salary of Meese's wife were questioned in front of the grand
jury.
   The Bender family arranged to pay the salary of Ursula Meese
while leasing office space to the Justice Department.
   The Associated Press reported last Wednesday that a partnership
headed by Howard M. Bender won a $50-million lease on Justice
Department offices after the Bender Foundation had put up money to
pay Mrs. Meese's salary at the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
   Mrs. Meese is to be questioned by McKay's office later this
month in connection with the job.
   Longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach, who is under indictment
in the Wedtech scandal, had a role in helping arrange the job for
Mrs. Meese, Wallach's attorney has told The Washington Post.
   McKay said 2{ weeks ago that he had insufficient evidence to
seek an indictment of Meese in connection with the oil pipeline or
the telephone stock but that his investigation would continue at
least through the end of April.
   In connection with the oil pipeline project, Meese referred
Wallach to then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane in May
1985. The referral led to a meeting the next month involving
McFarlane, Wallach and Wallach's client, Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, a partner in the pipeline project.
   Rappaport paid a $150,000 legal fee to Wallach, who deposited it
in a stock trading account owned by Meese's financial manager, W.
Franklyn Chinn. Chinn in effect pooled Wallach's money with that of
Meese and other customers to help generate $40,000 in stock trading
profits on a $50,000 investment in just 18 months. Wallach
introduced Meese to Chinn.
   McKay also has been investigating Meese's holdings of telephone
stock in 1985 and 1986 when Meese met with executives of four of
the seven regional Bell companies.
   The phone companies wanted the Justice Department to reverse its
position and to recommend that the so-called Baby Bells be
permitted to enter several new types of business. A year after his
meetings with the Bell executives, Meese approved the
recommendation reversing earlier department policy.
   Meese listed his telephone stock as having been sold on federal
financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 1986, but the attorney
general actually had transferred the holdings to Chinn. Meese
regained possession of the stock and sold it last September.
   McKay also has been examining Meese's efforts on behalf of
Wedtech. At Wallach's behest, then White House counselor Meese
intervened on behalf of the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor,
directing his White House staff to ensure that the company got a
fair hearing from the Army in connection with a $32 million engine
contract.

<HEAD>Once Iran Linked With Mining, Military Response Was Chosen Quickly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Reagan administration quickly decided last
week that if it could find evidence Iran planted the mine that
almost sank a Navy frigate, it would use military force to
retaliate, officials said Monday.
   Top aides to President Reagan also recommended, however, the
retaliation be ``proportionate'' and not involve any direct action
against Iranian installations on land, the officials said.
   The result was a simultaneous attack Monday morning on two
Iranian offshore platforms.
   ``The frame of reference was pretty well established from the
very beginning,'' said one of the officials, who like the others
agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified.
   ``We knew something had to be done, but there were not a lot of
options considered.''
   ``We had hit some of their offshore platforms before, and that
was pretty much the only thing we considered this time,'' another
source said.
   ``We're walking a line here of trying to protect freedom of
navigation in international waters. These platforms have been used
to support attacks on commercial shipping. We also need
congressional support and international support. We're not trying
to directly immerse ourselves in the Iran-Iraq war.''
   The latest confrontation with Iran began last Thursday when the
frigate Samuel B. Roberts struck an underwater mine in the central
gulf just hours after successfully shepherding an oil tanker to
Kuwait. Ten sailors were injured, although the crew managed to save
the ship.
   By the time Reagan met with his top security aides on Friday,
``it had been established conclusively that this was an Iranian
mine and that it had been deliberately planted and was not a
drifter,'' one source said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Monday there was ``no
doubt'' the mine had been sown by Iran. Citing a match of serial
numbers on the explosives with earlier captured mines, he added:
``It is very clear that they are new mines of Iranian manufacture.''
   Reagan, after another briefing Sunday night, gave the final
go-ahead for the retaliatory mission.
   Then, much to the surprise of top Pentagon officials, the
Iranians decided to confront U.S. forces directly in different
parts of the gulf rather than simply abandon the platforms. Two
Iranian frigates were disabled and one large patrol boat and three
smaller ones sunk or crippled by American forces in a day of
fighting.
   Carlucci suggested at one point Monday the confrontations
stemmed from Iranian fanaticism, adding the United States acted
only in self-defense when it attacked the various Iranian ships.
   ``We hope Iran will now realize the futility of its attempts to
interfere with peaceful international shipping in the Persian
Gulf,'' Carlucci added.
   ``We do not seek a confrontation with Iran, but we do intend to
continue our efforts to ensure freedom of navigation in the gulf.
And should the Iranians resume their attacks, our ships are
prepared to defend themselves just as they did today.''

<TEXT>
   NASA said Monday it will ask contractors this
summer to submit proposals for a $1.2 billion program to design and
build an advanced space shuttle booster rocket in a
government-owned plant.
   Under the plan, the winning contractor will design, build and
operate the plant. The rockets to be built there will be used by
the shuttle program well into the next century.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration gets its
shuttle rockets from a single private source, Morton Thiokol Inc.,
whose manufacturing facilities are situated in Utah. A
government-owned plant will enable NASA to change contractors if it
becomes dissatisfied.
   The request for proposals will be issued in June or July, NASA
said, so the advanced solid rocket motor will be available for
launching after Oct. 1, 1993.
   The new booster will enable the shuttle to carry 12,000 more
pounds of cargo to orbit than the current 65,000 pounds. That
increase will be equivalent to 2.4 extra shuttle missions a year on
a 14-flight schedule.
   ``To achieve the level of process control and automation needed
for high quality and reproducibility, NASA has concluded that a
substantially new facility is required,'' the space agency
announcement said.
   The overall cost for development and testing the booster is $1
bilion. The facilities will be budgeted at $200 million to $300
million.
   The site has not been announced, but NASA officials have told
Congress the prime candidates are Bay St. Louis and Yellow Creek in
Mississippi and an area near Cape Canaveral, Fla. NASA says the
government plant must be accessible by rail and water.
   J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Alabama, said five firms have expressed an interest in making the
rockets. United Technologies, Atlantic Research, Aerojet and
Hercules were interested in operating a government-owned plant, he
said, while Morton Thiokol wanted to improve its Utah facilities.
   Contractors bidding for the plant will be required to propose a
private-financing option for the facility, both for a government
site or a location of the contractor's choosing.

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli commandos operating with air
support assassinated PLO military chief Khalil al-Wazir, Tunisian
investigators concluded in a report released Monday.
   President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali condemned the ``flagrant,
premeditated aggression against Tunisian sovereignty'' and said his
government would file a complaint with the the U.N. Security
Council.
   Al-Wazir, 52, also known as Abu Jihad (Father of the Holy War),
was killed by seven commandos who burst into his home in a Tunis
suburb early Saturday. He was chief aide to Yasser Arafat, chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and was the PLO military
commander.
   The body is to be flown to Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday for
burial.
   Arafat blamed Israel's Mossad secret service immediately after
the assassination. News of the killing cause the worst violence in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since riots began
Dec. 8, with 17 Palestinians reported killed Saturday.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman condemned the
killing of al-Wazir. ``Violence is not the solution to the problems
of the Middle East,'' he said in Washington.
   Tunisian government investigators said they established Israeli
responsibility for ``this cowardly terrorist act which it (Israel)
planned and executed.''
   Their report said an Israeli military Boeing 707, registry
number 4X977, was about 35 miles outside Tunisian air space at the
moment of the attack.
   It jammed communications in Sidi Bou Said, the northern suburb
where al-Wazir lived, the report said. The plane was flying ``in
the international air corridor in a way so as not to expose itself
to Tunisian air forces,'' the investigators said.
   ``The terrorist group which assassinated the Palestinian leader
had sophisticated technological support which put this operation
beyond the framework of normal terrorists and into the kind of
terrorism that only states are in a position to practice,'' the
report declared.
   In October 1985, the Israeli air force raided the PLO
headquarters, killing about 80 Palestinians and 20 Tunisians and
wounding 100 people. Arafat was not there.
   Israeli leaders have said nothing about responsibility for the
killing, but Israeli sources said Monday it was the work of Mossad,
the navy and an elite commando unit.
   Arafat moved his headquarters to Tunis after the 1982 Israeli
invasion drove the PLO out of Lebanon.

   The daughter of the first person in the nation
charged with causing death by tampering with over-the-counter drug
capsules is prepared to testify for the prosecution, government
lawyers said Monday.
   The revelation was contained in a pretrial brief filed by
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida as jury selection began in the
trial of Stella Nickell, 44, in U.S. District Court.
   She is charged with two counts of causing a death by product
tampering and three of tampering with a product involved in
interstate commerce. Maximum penalties are life in prison on each
of the first two charges and 10 years on each of the other three,
which stem from the discovery of unsold bottles containing
cyanide-laced capsules on store shelves.
   Mrs. Nickell's husband, Bruce, 52, and Susan Katherine Snow, 40,
both of Auburn, died in June 1986 after ingesting tainted capsules
of Extra-Strength Excedrin. Authorities have not suggested any
other links between the victims.
   The deaths set off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its capsuled
non-prescription medicine.
   That December, Mrs. Nickell ``called her daughter, Cindy
Hamilton, and informed her that the FBI had claimed that she had
failed'' a lie-detector test, Ms. Maida's brief said.
   ``After learning this from her mother, Cindy Hamilton came
forward in January 1987 with information, previously unknown to the
authorities, that Stella Nickell had been planning the death of her
husband, Bruce, for several years,'' the brief said.
   The document said Ms. Hamilton, about whom no further
information was given, also told investigators her mother never
specifically mentioned Bruce Nickell as a target but had done
library research on how someone might be killed.
   Investigators found Mrs. Nickell's fingerprints on pages of the
book ``Deadly Harvest'' that cover cyanide poisoning, previously
filed court documents showed.
   She has been held without bail since her indictment in December.
   Judge William L. Dwyer and attorneys for both sides expect the
trial to last three weeks.

   An Army laboratory in Hawaii has identified
the remains of a U.S. serviceman missing in action from the Vietnam
War, the Pentagon said Monday.
   The remains were repatriated to the United States by the
Vietnamese government on Dec. 4, 1985, and have now been identified
as Air Force Capt. William E. Powell, the Pentagon said.
   Powell was lost over North Vietnam on Aug. 17, 1968. He was 25
at the time and listed his home of record as Gatesville, Texas.
   His remains were identified by the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Honolulu. They will be transported from Hickam Air
Force Base in Hawaii to Travis Air Force Base in California on
Tuesday after a full military honors ceremony, the Pentagon said.

<HEAD>Britain Backs U.S. Attack On Iran, Soviet Warns Of Escalation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said the U.S. attack on Iranian oil platforms Monday was
``entirely justified'' but the Soviet Union said it could prompt
more fighting in the Persian Gulf.
   Western European nations Monday suspended their mine-clearing
operations in the gulf because of the destruction of the two oil
platforms, a Dutch official said.
   U.S. forces also sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats and
bombed two Iranian naval frigates after they fired on American
planes.
   American officials said the platform raids were in retaliation
for a mine explosion Thursday that damaged an American frigate and
wounded 10 sailors.
   Iran has denied laying the mine.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain told reporters she
was ``satisfied from the evidence we have that the mines were laid
by Iran and that the U.S. reaction was entirely justified as a
proportionate response.''
   Foreign Office Minister David Mellor told the House of Commons
that the U.S. attack was ``a measured and proportionate response''
to renewed mine-laying in the gulf by Iran.
   Egyptian officials in Cairo also supported the American actions.
   ``We understand the American response and we urge Iran to stop
its policy of provoking others,'' Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said in a statement.
   In the Soviet Union, a television commentator said President
Reagan ordered the attack ``under pressure from the extreme
right,'' and because he ``wanted to show American society and the
whole world that he is acting from a position of strength.''
   ``This is a road to nowhere,'' said commentator Farid
Seiful-Mulyukov on the nightly news program Vremya.
   The official news agency Tass said the raids brought tension in
the Persian Gulf to a ``critical level'' once again.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, protested the raid
to the United Nations and threatened retaliation, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency said in dispatches monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus.
   In Athens, Greek officials said the American attack did not
contribute to a ``de-escalation of tension prevailing in the
region, but on the contrary could dangerously escalate the conflict
between Iran and Iraq.''
   The U.S.-Iranian confrontation was a subject of discussion at a
meeting of the Western European Union in The Hague. The group is a
defense forum comprised of the Netherlands, Britain, Belgium,
France, West Germany, Italy and Luxembourg.
   The British were expected to use the meeting to seek a statement
in support of the U.S. raid.
   Early Monday, the U.S. government told the flotilla of Belgian,
Dutch, Italian and British mine-clearing vessels in the gulf of its
plans to attack.
   Dutch Defense Minister Willem van Eekelen said the ships
immediately suspended operations.
   The mine-clearing vessels ``are awaiting new instructions,'' Van
Eekelen said. He added that there were no plans to order the ships
out of the gulf.
   In retaliation for Monday's U.S. raid, Iran attacked the
British-flagged York Marine, several other vessels and oil
facilities.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, in the Netherlands
for the Western European Union meeting, said he was ``absolutely
outraged that there should be an attack on a defenseless
British-flagged vessel.''

   Spectators burst into applause when John
Demjanjuk was convicted of war crimes Monday, but his family walked
out halfway through the 12-hour reading of the verdict. He heard it
in a cell, lying on a cot with back pains.
   An assistant prosecutor said a survivor of the Treblinka death
camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, Eliyahu Rosenberg, beamed after the
verdict, hugged him and said: ``I feel better now.''
   Rosenberg was one of five survivors who identified Demjanjuk,
68, as the brutal death camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible,'' who
terrorized prisoners and ran the gas chambers at Treblinka.
   Demjanjuk listened to the reading of the 450-page judgement from
a cot in a courthouse holding cell, where he was taken after
complaining of back pains.
   When the court session opened, guards carried him feet-first
across the courtroom stage into the cell after he began weeping and
refused to leave the police van. The trial was conducted in a
converted movie theater.
   Two other Holocaust survivors who testified against Demjanjuk
were among more than 600 spectators.
   At one point, survivor Pinchas Epstein was helped from the
courtroom in tears after judges quoting from his testimony said
Ivan ``would gloat at the crushed faces, the blood flowing after he
brutalized people.''
   Six hours into the opinion, Demjanjuk's wife Vera, daughter
Lydia, son John Jr. and son-in-law Ed Nishnic walked out of the
courtroom in protest.
   ``We just couldn't sit there any longer and listen to that
garbage,'' said Nishnic, who raised $650,000 for the defense.
   John Jr., 22, said: ``It's a disgrace to the word justice. These
are old-fashioned hanging judges. As far as I'm concerned, this was
nothing more than a Soviet show trial. Whenever one of our
witnesses came on, they got the hammer.''
   Nishnic said: ``This is going to go down in history as the most
lopsided case ever conducted anywhere in the world.''
   Defense lawyer John Gill contended that the three-judge court
automatically rejected defense arguments.
   ``My God in heaven, according to the judges we didn't do
anything right,'' he said. ``They ruled against us on every single
point.''
   Mrs. Demjanjuk, 62, was seen crying and wringing her hands
during a lunch break. ``I can't sit down. I can't sit down,'' she
said.
   Although the courtroom remained full through the often tedious
reading, many spectators fell asleep, read newspapers or slipped
outside for a smoke or snack.
   Dov Levine, the presiding judge, quoted twice from the Bible. In
one instance, he said Samuel 18:26 supported the contention of a
Treblinka survivor who said he recognized Demjanjuk by the way he
walked.
   ``In the Bible we find references to identifying an individual
by his gait,'' Levine said.
   After the reading, Demjanjuk walked slowly to a police van
supported by two policemen and surrounded by 16 other guards. He
looked somber, his head was bowed and his hands were clasped.
   When reporters hidden from view behind a 6-foot-high screen
asked how he felt after the verdict, he looked up and appeared
surprised.
   ``I'm very good!'' he shouted. ``I'm an innocent man! I will
appeal and I'm sure I will win!''
   As police hustled him toward the van, he added: ``This is
ridiculous what happened hayom,'' using the Hebrew word for
``today.''

   Kenya's Ibrahim Hussein won the Boston Marathon by
one second Monday, becoming the first African champion of the
world's oldest marathon. Portugal's Rosa Mota won the women's
division for the second straight year.
   The one-second margin made it the closest finish the 92-year-old
race has ever had.
   Hussein and Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania ran shoulder-to-shoulder
from about the 22-mile point until the closing strides of the
26-mile, 385-yard course.
   With Ikangaa a step in front with about 100 yards to go, Hussein
burst past and beat him to the finish line. His winning time was 2
hours, 8 minutes, 43 seconds, the second-fastest time for the
Boston Marathon. Australian Rob de Castella's 1986 performance in
2:07:51 holds the record.
   Hussein's one-second victory eclipsed two previous two-second
margins to become the closest Boston Marathon ever. Ireland's John
Treacy, 1984 Olympic silver medalist, finished third in 2:09:15.
   Mota, 1984 Olympic bronze medalist, took the women's title with
a time of 2:24:30. Tuija Jousimaa, of Finland, was the second
woman's finisher in 2:29:26, with Canada's Odette LaPierre third in
2:30:35.
   Hussein and Mota each won $45,000 plus a car valued at more than
$35,000 for their victories.
   More than 6,700 runners participated in the race under rainy
skies.

<HEAD>Government Saves Tax Legislation Despite Intra-Party Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
saved its tax legislation Monday despite a revolt in the ranks that
cut her usual huge majority in the House of Commons to 25.
   After noisy debate, a 320-295 vote defeated an amendment by
Conservative Party rebels to the government bill on property taxes,
which critics say is unfair to the poor.
   It was one of the government's worst days in Parliament, where
the Conservatives have a majority of 101 seats, since Mrs. Thatcher
took office nine years ago.
   Rebellious rank-and-file Conservative members rallied behind
Michael Mates and voted for his amendment, which would have tied
the tax to a person's ability to pay rather than assessing a flat
rate regardless of income.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition socialist Labor Party,
was jubilant about the Tory rebellion and declared in the Commons:
``The flagship is badly holed and sinking fast!''
   During the often rowdy session, Mates denied he was challenging
Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``We are debating principles, not personalities,'' he said in a
43-minute speech punctuated by heckling from his own party. ``I
don't find this a comfortable position, to be standing here
offering criticism of the government.''
   At issue was a clause of the Local Government Finance Bill
levying property taxes on each adult in a household instead of on
the house or apartment in which they live, as the case is now.
   Last week, Tory revolts cut government majorities to 74 and 81
in votes on the introduction of charges for dental and eye checkups
under the National Health Service.
   Those charges, which follow a shakeup in the system of welfare
payments, are part of of the third-term program Mrs. Thatcher says
is designed to end the ``dependency culture.''
   Conservatives to the political left of the prime minister say
the program feeds the belief that her government is right-wing and
uncaring.
   In addition to charges for some health services, the tax
legislation reduces the top rate on income from 60 percent to 40.
   The government says the new property tax system, to take effect
in 1990, will be fairer, spreading the liability to 35 million
people from the current 18 million heads of households.

   More than 1,200 mourners paid their
last respects Monday to four siblings brutally slain in a mobile
home, killings one family member blamed on a convoluted judicial
system.
   Jennifer Mann, 19, her sisters Shannon, 17, and Martha, 15, and
brother Ernest, 11, were buried Monday after a memorial service at
Mission Park South funeral home.
   An assailant broke into their mobile home early Friday and
attacked them with steak knives, some broken by the force of the
blows. The girls were sexually mutilated, officials said.
   The girl's parents, Ernest and Becky Mann, who are separated,
were not home during the attack.
   Shannon Mann's former boyfriend, Leo Narvaiz Jr., 20, was
arrested shortly after the attack and charged with four counts of
murder. He remained in the Bexar County Jail in lieu of $4.05
million bond.
   Grady Mann Jr., an uncle of the victims, blamed authorities for
the deaths because Narvaiz was not arrested quickly enough for an
earlier threat.
   ``We feel the Mann children were victims of a system that has
lost the meaning of a basic principle that our founding fathers
felt was foremost _ the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness,'' Mann said outside the funeral home.
   ``For the Mann children, these rights are gone forever.''
   At the time of the killings, police had been looking for Narvaiz
because of a complaint filed by Ricky Moore, 24, who was dating
Shannon Mann. Moore alleged that Narvaiz had damaged his pickup
truck and threatened him with a knife on March 28.
   Moore criticized police for not arresting Narvaiz sooner, but
officials blamed a clogged justice system for the delay.
   Police have said Narvaiz is the sole suspect in the slayings,
but they are analyzing the tape of a frenzied call one of the girls
made to a 911 emergency exchange for further clues.
   ``It is our hope this tragedy might serve as a catalyst for all
of us nationally to personally protest the system that has
evolved,'' Grady Mann said.
   ``The system protects and shelters the rights of the few and in
so doing neglects the needs of the many,'' he said. ``The time for
change is now, lest another family need go through the agony and
torture of loss, whether one or many.''
   After Monday's five-minute graveside service, the victims'
father rose and screamed, ``I want my boy. I want my boy.''
   Earlier, mourners filed past four identical, gray caskets
bearing the victims' snapshots in the funeral home. The coffins
were surrounded by hundreds of roses. Pink carnations were placed
on top of the girls' coffins and blue carnations on the boy's.
   Friends of the Manns have set up two funds to help defray the
family's funeral costs, which are expected to total more than
$10,000.

   John Shepherd, Attorney General Edwin Meese
III's choice to fill the No. 2 post at the Justice Department, told
officials Monday to proceed with a search to fill the job,
department sources said.
   While not yet closing the door on the post, Shepherd is on the
verge of withdrawing from consideration for the job of deputy
attorney general, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Shepherd has said he is concerned about the stress on his family
of the public scrutiny that has occurred since Meese picked him.
   Two weeks ago, Meese hurriedly selected Shepherd, a former
president of the American Bar Association, for the position without
customary White House clearance and FBI background checks.
President Reagan has not yet formally nominated Shepherd.
   In brief remarks to reporters, Meese said that he didn't expect
to have a decision from Shepherd until mid-week. But several
sources said that Shepherd as a matter of courtesy had already
informed the department that he probably will withdraw from
consideration for the post and that aides to Meese should start
looking for other candidates. In fact, the search was already under
way, said the sources.
   A secretary at Shepherd's law firm said that he is not returning
telephone calls to the news media. His home telephone number is
unlisted.
   Meanwhile, Meese has gone outside the department in attempt to
fill another top vacancy, the post of assistant attorney general in
charge of the criminal division, other Justice Department sources
said.
   Sounded out about the possibility of taking the criminal
division post by aides to Meese is Stephen A. Saltzburg, a
University of Virginia law professor. Saltzburg is a consultant on
a legal question in the Iran-Contra prosecution of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, said the sources, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Reached at his home, Saltzburg said he hadn't been offered the
job, but would not comment when asked whether he had been
approached about it.
   Saltzburg is a consultant to former federal judge and ex-U.S.
attorney, Herb Stern. Stern was hired by Walsh to represent the
Iran-Contra prosecutor on the issue of congressional immunity.
   The legal question is whether or not the congressional testimony
compelled by grants of immunity to former National Security Council
staffer Oliver North, former national security adviser John
Poindexter and businessman Albert Hakim prejudice their Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   In connection with the post Shepherd would fill, the 62-year-old
St. Louis attorney told Meese last Friday that he was giving
serious consideration to withdrawing because of stress on his
family stemming from his selection.
   A former bookkeeper from Shepherd's law firm testified shortly
before Meese recommended him for the post that she had an affair
weith Shepherd. The bookkeeper, who was convicted of embezzlement,
claimed Shepherd had told her to write checks to herself. Shepherd
denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her
to write checks.
   The trial testimony and Shepherd's membership in an all-white
country club and an all-male social club brought increasing public
scrutiny to Shepherd after Meese announced his selection April 5.
   In an interview Friday with The Washington Post, Shepherd spoke
of the ``tremendous pressure that this whole ordeal has been on me
and my wife.''
   ``It's more severe than anybody could have anticipated,''
Shepherd said he told Meese last week. He said the stress has
caused ``the complete disruption of our family life.''
   Meese's efforts to fill the posts of deputy attorney general and
head of the criminal division stem from the March 29 resignations
of Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William Weld. They
stepped aside out of concern that the nearly year-old criminal
investigation of Meese is hurting Justice Department operations,
morale and image.
   Meese, who testified before a federal grand jury for four hours
in the probe Monday, has refused to resign, predicting that he
won't be indicted.
   Meese's first choice to fill the post of deputy attorney general
was former federal judge Arlin Adams, now a Philadelphia lawyer.
Adams said he was unable to take the post because of a heavy
caseload and the fact that he had gone to work at the law firm just
last year. Adams said Meese's legal problems were not a major
factor in his decision not to take the Justice Department position.

<HEAD>Survivor tells of Massacre of 192 Villagers by Cattle Rustlers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mojong Lorika wept Monday as he described
how his 2-year-old son was killed by cattle rustlers who massacred
192 Kenyan villagers, the Kenya News Agency reported Monday.
   The agency said that in an interview, Lorika said that when
raiders burst into his home at 5 a.m. last Wednesday he ``grabbed
his son and took cover in a corner.'' But the rustlers opened fire
and a bullet struck the child in the head, killing him instantly.
   Laban Kitele, a minister of state, said police tracked the gang
of 50 rustlers from the raided village, 30 miles west of the border
town of Lokichoggio, and killed 40 in a gunbattle. He said the
other rustlers escaped across the border into Sudan. He mentioned
no police casualties.
   Kitele, in a statement Sunday, also said the police recovered
3,000 of about 3,500 cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys that had been
seized by the rustlers.
   He described the rustlers as a ``terror gang'' of Sudanese from
the Toposas tribe and Ndongiros from Ethiopia and said they were
armed with automatic rifles and machetes.
   There are several nomadic tribes in East Africa that believe all
animals were given to them by God and it is their right and duty to
win them back.
   The state-run news agency's correspondent interviewed Lorika at
the Lodwar district hospital where 19 of 50 wounded survivors were
being treated.
   The news agency quoted medical health officer John Adongosi as
saying eight of the patients were in critical condition from bullet
wounds and machete gashes. It said six severely wounded victims
were flown to Nairobi for surgery.
   Wednesday's massacre occured in the remote Turkana district in
northwestern Kenya. Heavy rains in the mountainous region made
roads to the raided village impassable and turned a nearby dirt
airstrip into a muddy bog.
   The Sunday Nation, an independent newspaper, reported the sky
over the ravaged village was black with vultures.
   Kitele's statement also referred to a March 30 attack by
rustlers on a camp of nomads in northern Kenya, during which they
hacked to death 15 people and fled with some 2,000 goats.
   ``Rustlers have lost all respect for human life to the extent
that they will massacre human beings in cold blood,'' Kitele said.
``I wish to warn anybody within Kenya or outside still harboring
ideas of rustling to desist .... Government response to rustling
will always be prompt and aggressive hot pursuit.''
   Nomads regularly cross the borders in East Africa in search of
pasture for their animals.
   The Daily Nation, also an independent newspaper, called Monday
for the East African nations to establish a joint organization to
wage war on stock thieves.
   ``It is easy for raiders to pounce on a village on this side,
kill people and take livestock before vanishing to the other side,
where international law forbids our forces from following them,''
the paper said.
   Mohamed Yusuf Haji, a provincial commissioner, managed to visit
the massacre site and he told The Sunday Nation he found only bones
and skulls left by vultures and scavenging animals.

   Jesse Jackson said Monday that the atmosphere in

   In response to questions about the attacks on him by Mayor
Edward Koch, Jackson said, ``The name-calling and the accusations
and the attempts of a provocation by the mayor have not been good
for the city or the campaign.''
   Koch has kept up a drumbeat of attacks on Jackson.
   Early in the campaign, the mayor said that Jews and other
supporters of Israel would ``have to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson.
   In a television interview on Sunday, the mayor said Jackson has
lied when he had claimed to be the last person Martin Luther King
Jr. spoke to before he died after being shot in Memphis and again
when he denied he had ever used the terms ``Hymie'' and
``Hymietown.'' The terms are considered offensive to Jews and
Jackson later apologized for using them.
   ``We have received more death threats in this campaign than in
all the other combined because the climate has been so divisive and
so violent,'' Jackson told a news conference.
   Jackson customarily receives far more death threats than any of
the other candidates, and travels with heavy Secret Service and
other protection.
   Later, he exhorted his supporters to turn out in force for the
New York primary and give him an upset victory that could scramble
the odds in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Standing in the rain at a get-out-the-vote rally in East Harlem,
Jackson said, ``If you will stand in the rain today, you will vote
in the rain tomorrow. ... We've come too close. Nothing can stop us
now.''
   Recent polls said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was getting
the most support among likely Democratic voters with Jackson
running a strong second. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee was a
distant third.
   Turnout was the big unknown in efforts to predict the outcome on
Tuesday and Jackson spent the last full day of campaigning trying
to keep enthusiasm high among his strongest supporters.
   He scheduled three rallies in different parts of Harlem where
black and Hispanic voters turned out in large numbers to support
him in the 1984 New York presidential primary, and a fourth in
Chinatown.
   ``The race is getting closer and turnout is the key,'' said New
York pollster Lee Miringoff. He said a low turnout would favor
Jackson, whose supporters are seen as generally being more fervent
than those of the other candidates, and thus more likely to follow
through and vote.
   In a speech to the non-partisan Association for a Better New
York, Jackson never mentioned Koch by name but referred to ``those
who are inclined because of their fears to be bent toward
hysteria.''
   He went on, ``Leaders must set a high moral tone. I will not
surrender that tone to diversions.''
   However, Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign manager, had less
restraint, saying, ``Koch is a lunatic. He's a lunatic by New York
standards.''
   The mayor, campaigning with Gore, dismissed the criticism from
the Jackson camp.
   ``So should I decline to say these things simply because he says
it's divisive?'' said the mayor. ``I mean he's not an icon. He's a
candidate. Candidates have to be able to take it and respond.''

<HEAD>State Archives to Open Police Reports on Robert Kennedy
Assassination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conspiracy theorists, scholars and a
man wounded during the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy were
waiting anxiously Monday for the release of police files on the
killing.
   ``This is a kind of vindication of citizens' efforts to force
this material out,'' said Gregory Stone, a professor on leave from
the University of Wisconsin who has devoted himself to studying
Kennedy's killing.
   Secretary of State March Fong Eu plans to open the Los Angeles
Police Department's voluminous investigative files on the
assassination Tuesday. They include some 2,500 photographs, 50,000
pages of written material and interviews with 4,000 witnesses,
officials said.
   Eu's spokeswoman, Melissa Warren, said her office had been
inundated with calls since announcing the impending release,
including many from Massachusetts, Kennedy's home state, and New
York, which he represented as a senator.
   ``There have been dozens of calls from all over the state, all
over the country, from news people, from historians and the just
plain interested,'' she said.
   Most of the material has been sealed since shortly after Kennedy
was gunned down at the Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968. A summary
of police files was released in 1986, but names and details then
considered sensitive were deleted.
   The summary concluded that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, a Jordanian
immigrant, was the lone assassin. It found no evidence of a second
gunman or a conspiracy.
   The summary also concluded that Sirhan, who is serving a life
sentence at Soledad Prison for the killing, was sane and was not
under the influence of alcohol when he shot Kennedy moments after
he had claimed victory in the California Democratic presidential
primary.
   Sirhan has said he does not remember shooting Kennedy and blamed
his amnesia on alcohol.
   Although Sirhan shot Kennedy in full view of numerous
spectators, controversy arose later about how many shots were fired
and whether a second gunman was involved.
   Paul Schrade, then a Kennedy aide, suffered a gunshot wound
during the assassination. Investigators have said the bullet that
hit his head first passed through Kennedy's suit jacket. Schrade
has disputed that account as physically impossible and hopes the
released files will answer some of his questions.
   ``I'm pleased that this is happening,'' said Schrade, who fought
for years to open the files. But he said it would take months for
investigators to sort through the material and find any new
information which may exist.
   The only things withheld from disclosure, Eu said, are autopsy
photos, criminal ``rap sheets'' and fingerprint cards, juvenile
case records, internal police personnel records and records that
originated with the FBI or other non-Los Angeles police agencies.
   Microfilm copies of most documents will be sold for $275. A
complete set of materials including video and audio tapes will cost
$412.
   Copies of the materials also will be open to the public at the
archives.
   California Chief Archivist John F. Burns, who catalogued and
microfilmed the material, said the FBI would be releasing its own
file at an unspecified time.

   The right-wing Arena party
filed a protest Monday with the Supreme Court, claiming the Central
Elections Council wrongly deprived it of a majority in the National
Assembly.
   A complaint filed by the Republican Nationalist Alliance, known
as Arena, said the council should have allotted it 31 of the 60
seats in the assembly.
   The council's final decision from the March 20 elections gave 30
seats to Arena and 23 to President Jose Napoleon Duarte's centrist
Christian Democratic Party.
   The election was a crushing defeat for the Christian Democrats
who had held 33 seats while Arena had only 13.
   Arena's protest claimed the elections council should have
allotted only 22 seats to the Christian Democrats instead of 23.
   Arena did not challenge the seven seats awarded to the National
Conciliation Party, which although it is conservative has said it
will align itself with the Christian Democrats to form a voting
bloc equal to Arena's 30 seats.
   The disputed legislative seat is from the easternmost province
of La Union.
   In the outgoing legislature the National Conciliation Party had
12 seats and there were two independent.
   The three-member Central Elections Council, which supervises the
vote count, had one representative from each of the major parties.
   Arena's representative had walked out of the council, claiming
the count was incorrect, but the Christian Democrat and National
Conciliation members continued with the count and announced the
results.
   All parties have agreed the dispute over the La Union seat will
not prevent the installation of the new assembly as scheduled on
May 1.

   Jurors began deliberating punishment
Monday for a Houston animal trainer whose lion mauled an 8-year-old
girl at a flea market in October.
   Prosecutors recommended the maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a $5,000 fine for 35-year-old Gary Durkovitz.
   A jury convicted Durkovitz on Friday of injury to a child in the
Oct. 10, 1987, mauling of Roxanne Hernandez at the Texas Flea
Market in Houston.
   Durkovitz' lion, Samson, was on display when it grabbed the
child by the head and bit into the girl's skull, exposing her
brain. Roxanne and her mother, Sonia, both testified last week.
   The girl said all she remembered about the attack was that ``the
lion got me. I didn't know what it was.'' Roxanne has undergone
reconstructive surgery and faces more operations to repair part of
a missing skull and a bald spot on her head.
   Mrs. Hernandez testified that they went to the flea market to
buy a gift and that the attack occurred shortly after they entered
the building.
   ``The lion was wrestling with my daughter and I was pulling it
trying to get it off my daughter,'' Mrs. Hernandez said. ``I was
screaming out for her and she was screaming out for me.
   ``I was screaming for help and she would call out my name, `Mom,
Mom, help me,' '' she said.
   Mrs. Hernandez said she pulled the lion's mane, and that the
animal tried to put the girl's head into its mouth.
   ``I saw the lion when he took her scalp off,'' Mrs. Hernandez
said. ``I felt really helpless at that time and at that moment I
felt it was going to kill her.''
   She said a security guard shot the lion and it loosened its grip
on her child. It later was destroyed.
   Mrs. Hernandez said her daughter was in the hospital for a
month, and had a tutor at home until February when she returned to
school.

   Actor James Garner was hospitalized Monday
and began a series of tests prior to surgery to clear an
obstruction restricting the flow of blood from his heart, a
spokeswoman said.
   ``It's major surgery and they are going to operate and take care
of it,'' Garner's assistant, Maryann Rea, said shortly after the
actor checked into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Surgery was
scheduled Thursday morning.
   During the planned three-hour operation, a balloon will be used
to compress an aneurysm formed on the wall of the aorta, which
takes blood from the left ventrical of the heart to the body.
   Garner, who turned 60 on April 7, was expected to be
hospitalized for about 10 days.
   ``He's feeling fine,'' said Ms. Rea, adding the aneurysm was
discovered during a regular checkup. ``He wasn't sick and had no
pain. Yes, it was a surprise.''
   Garner, best remembered by television viewers of the old
``Maverick'' and ``Rockford Files'' series, was nominated for an
Oscar for his starring role opposite Sally Field in the movie
``Murphy's Romance.''
   He also starred with Julie Andrews in ``Victor Victoria.''

   Army curfews and strikes to protest the killing
of a PLO leader paralyzed the occupied lands Monday and hospital
officials said soldiers shot two Arabs to death, including a woman
who was taking her children home.
   At least 167 Palestinians have been reported killed since riots
began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has
occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war. An Israeli soldier and civilian also have been
slain.
   Israel ordered the closure of Jerusalem's only English-language
magazine owned by Palestinians, alleging that it is financed and
directed by terrorist organizations. Its managing editor denied the
allegations.
   Buildings in the West Bank were draped with black flags of
mourning for assassinated PLO leader Khalil al-Wazir. Hundreds of
Palestinians paid condolence calls in Nablus to al-Wazir's cousin
during three days of mourning, said Adnan Zahran of Nablus.
   ``Nablus is a city of ghosts,'' the 30-year-old engineer told
The Associated Press by telephone the West Bank's largest city,
which was in its second day of curfew.
   Al-Wazir, also called Abu Jihad (Father of the Holy War), was
killed early Saturday by commandos who burst into his home in a
surburb of Tunis, Tunisia.
   News of the death inspired riots in the West Bank and Gaza in
which 17 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 wounded. It was
the bloodiest day in the territories since the rebellion began.
   In a message to Arabs in the occupied lands, Palestinian
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat said al-Wazir, his
chief aide and the PLO's military commander, ``fell, weapon in his
hand, to the bullets of a Mossad gang.'' The Mossad is the Israeli
secret service.
   Arafat said he had lost ``a brother, a friend, a revolutionary
companion and one of the symbols of the liberation fight of the
Palestinian people. ... The price of his death will be high.''
   Tunisian investigators concluded Israel was responsible.
President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali said Tunisia would complain to
the U.N. Security Council of the ``flagrant, premeditated
aggression against Tunisian sovereignty.''
   Israel has said nothing officially, but Israeli sources have
said the assassination was the work of Mossad, the navy and an
elite commando unit.
   In Gaza City, a 30-year-old mother of six was killed Monday
while trying to get her children indoors, away from a fight in a
nearby street between young Arabs and Israeli soldiers, her
mother-in-law said.
   Aidah Othman Totah, whose children are aged 9 months to 11
years, managed to get three inside and went looking for others,
then ``came back shouting, crying `I was wounded,''' Farida Nimer
Dib told The AP in the family's house.
   ``She fell on the floor and I held her in my arms. ... Suddenly
I saw blood coming out of her mouth. Then her arms dropped and she
died,'' Mrs. Dib said.
   The woman was buried in at a funeral attended by about 300
mourners shouting, ``Stones are as strong as guns!'' Arab witnesses
said. Soldiers dispersed them with tear gas.
   Army officials confirmed Mrs. Totah's death but said soldiers
``had nothing whatsoever'' to do with it. They said no soldiers
fired live ammunition in the area.
   The army said troopers shot and killed a 20-year-old Palestinian
during a protest at Rafah in the Gaza Strip. Arab reports
identified him as Mohammed Zereb.
   Israeli officials issued an order closing the weekly Al Awdah,
published in English and Arabic. The magazine was given until May 1
to appeal, said managing editor Elias Zananiri, who denied the
allegations of terrorist support and direction.
   His magazine is published by the same Palestinians who ran the
Palestine Press Service, which monitored the rebellion in the
occupied territories until it was closed last month.
   Army reports said 28 Palestinian refugee camps, towns or cities
were either under curfew or closed to journalists.
   Former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon applauded the killing of
al-Wazir with the comment: ``One has to knock off the murderous
heads of the terror organizations.''
   Ariel Merari, an expert on terrorism at Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said Monday the killing
appeared to be an Israeli operation. He had speculated initially
that al-Wazir was assassinated by a rival Palestinian faction.
   Three PLO leaders, including previous military commander Kamel
Adwan, were killed in 1973 by an Israeli squad that entered and
left Beirut via the sea, as the commandos in Tunis apparently did.

   Pills carried by actor Jan-Michael Vincent
when he was arrested last week for investigation of possessing
drugs were caffeine tablets and not illegal amphetamines,
authorities said.
   Based on laboratory tests, the district attorney's office on
Monday declined to charge Vincent with felony possession of
amphetamine, as alleged by the Sheriff's Department, said spokesman
Andy Reynolds.
   In addition, no charges will be filed in connection with the
remnants of a marijuana cigarette found in the ashtray of the car
Vincent was riding in, Reynolds said. The car was borrowed and
there was no evidence linking Vincent to the marijuana, he said.
   Deputies on patrol in Agoura Hills on Wednesday stopped a car
driven by Vincent's wife because its registration had expired,
authorities said. Vincent, 42, a passenger in the car, was arrested
after 12 white tablets were found.
   Attorney Ronald Carpol, who represents Vincent, couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Vincent, who played a tough helicopter pilot in the canceled
CBS-TV version of ``Airwolf'' and won a Golden Globe nomination for
his role in the film ``Going Home,'' lives in Malibu.

   Congressional leaders joined ranks Monday to
support President Reagan's decision to retaliate against Iran for a
mine attack that seriously damaged a U.S. Navy frigate in the
Persian Gulf.
   They applauded Reagan for consulting with Congress in advance of
his decision to order Navy ships destroy two Iranian oil drilling
platforms in the gulf on Monday. Several called the military action
``appropriate and measured.''
   Others said that by engaging in genuine consultation in advance
_ instead of merely informing Congress later, as he has in the past
_ Reagan may have defused a possible congressional fight over
whether he should have invoked the War Powers Act before ordering
the Navy to retaliate.
   ``There will be no fight ... as long as they keep consulting,''
said Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the House deputy Democratic leader.
   ``The mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the
Iranians and sown in the waters by the Iranians,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``The Iranians were
carrying out terrorist acts. ... I support the decision to destroy
the (Iranian) platforms.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas told his colleagues:
   ``In my view, now is the time to send only one message to our
adversaries: That the United States, the president, the Congress
and the people are united and determined to meet our
responsibilities and defend our interests in the gulf.
   ``I hope the ayatollah (Khomeini) gets that message so we can
all avoid further bloodshed and violence,'' Dole said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the White House
discussions were ``very frank'' and candid and that the
congressional leaders pointed out the perils as well as the
possible benefits of taking military action.
   Wright said of Reagan: ``He is the commander in chief and when
action is taken by the United States, it certainly behooves all of
us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a nation that is
united.''
   ``It seems to me the critical thing is that what was done was
done in a measured fashion against inanimate objects to demonstrate
we had the capacity to close down Iranian oil production,'' Wright
said.
   Wright, Byrd, Dole and House Majority Leader Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., and Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., were summoned to
the White House on Sunday evening and briefed on last Thursday's
mine attack on the USS Samuel B. Roberts.
   ``For the first time, we were consulted before the executive
order was issued and before it was decided _ and that was good,''
Byrd said.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the U.S. response appropriate
and said Congress should not begin ``a chorus of calls for
invocation of the War Powers Act.''
   He urged lawmakers to support Reagan, wait 24 hours to 48 hours,
then evaluate whether the U.S. actions have been proper.
   ``It's clear we have a very dangerous situation,'' McCain said.
``If it begins to appear that there will be further escalation, I
think (the president) needs to talk directly to the American
people. ... The worst mistake would be for them to be kept in the
dark.''
   But Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., one of the Senate's strongest
advocates of invoking the War Powers Act in the Persian Gulf, said
the latest incidents demonstrate that by refusing to follow the
requirements of the law, the administration and Congress, ``have
evaded their obligation to develop a long-term national policy.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said, however, he believed the
Iranian missile attack on a U.S. warship in the gulf had exposed
Americans to hostilities and therefore had already triggered the
act's 60-day clock.
   ``Congress has a responsibility to become involved,'' Specter
said, but added that if calm is restored lawmakers may not press
the issue. ``It depends on future events as to how vigorously it
would be pursued,'' he said.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., who has urged that the War Powers
Act be invoked, accused the Senate of being ``lulled into
complacency'' about the gulf in recent months.
   ``I don't hear many voices calling for the War Powers
Resolution. In fact, most everybody seems to be cheering the
action. My fear is that it will take dead bodies _ the dead bodies
of U.S. servicemen _ to force us to face our responsibility,''
Hatfield said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the administration's retaliation ``was a
measured and correct response.'' But he said the War Powers Act
should have been invoked ``many months ago so that the
administration and the Congress could be working in tandem and not
at cross purposes.''
   Adams said: ``Any time you have mining, a U.S. vessel hitting
back, shelling platforms, these are certainly acts of war and the
War Powers Act should be invoked.''
   As for Reagan's action, he said, ``of course, I support
protecting our people, taking defensive actions.''
   Under the War Powers Act, hostilities involving U.S. military
forces trigger a 90-day period during which the president must
report to Congress on the situation and Congress must vote on
whether or not to keep those forces deployed. Otherwise U.S. units
must be withdrawn.
   Presidents of both parties have opposed the act as an
infringement of their powers as commander in chief.

   Cardinal John O'Connor
of New York on Monday addressed an AIDS conference with a plea that
victims of the incurable disease be treated with compassion and
dignity.
   ``We have 17 Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese of New
York,'' the Roman Catholic prelate said. ``I have personally urged
that any person coming to any one of these hospitals seeking
assistance because of the possibility of AIDS be treated with
absolute, total and unconditional dignity.''
   ``I spend many nights in one of those hospitals, St. Clare's,''
visiting AIDS patients, he said. ``Often, I empty their bed pans,
comb their hair or mop their brow ... I have realized more and more
that every single one is a sacred human person made in the image
and likeness of almighty God.''
   Following his address at Catholic University, the 68-year-old
O'Connor flew by private plane to Cuba.
   He is to celebrate a Mass in Santiago de Cuba Monday evening and
then go to Havana to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth
of the Rev. Felix Varela, a Cuban priest who spent many years in
New York and became vicar general of the archdiocese.
   O'Connor arrived in the Dominican Republic on Sunday and
baptized the 7-month-old son of a niece of President Joaquin
Balaguer.
   Before addressing the AIDS conference, O'Connor dedicated new
equipment at Robert Reid Cabral Children's Hospital and attended
ground-breaking ceremonies for the Child Jesus Children's Hospital.
   The Child Jesus facility is being built with funds provided by
the Foundation for Catholic Health Care in the Dominican Republic.
The foundation, which O'Connor helped set up last year, sponsored
the conference on AIDS.
   O'Connor will be the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic leader to
visit Cuba since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 and established
a communist regime. Castro has recently eased restrictions on
religious activities in Cuba.

   Vice President George Bush, campaigning
Monday in Ohio, defended the U.S. military action in the Persian
Gulf and said, ``We're not going to back down.''
   Bush told the Toledo Rotary Club that the U.S. strike on Iranian
oil platforms was ``a measured military action to make sure the
Iranians have no illusions. ... They've got to know we're going to
protect our ships, and if they threaten us we'll respond.''
   Asked if the United States were, in effect, in a state of
undeclared war with Iran, the vice president said: ``No, we're
not.''
   Bush aides said he was briefed Sunday on the planned military
operation and also met with President Reagan and congressional
leaders at the White House in the evening.
   ``We didn't see any reason to cancel this trip,'' Bush chief of
staff Craig Fuller said.
   The vice president, all but assured of being the Republican
presidential nominee in the fall, was campaigning one day before
the New York primary. The Pennsylvania primary is a week later;
Ohio's is a week after that.
   Asked by reporters about the developments after he addressed a
group of Toledo business leaders, Bush said, ``Our people
understand it is appropriate to have a proper response when our
obligation is protection of sea lanes. We took an appropriate
response. Iran decided to escalate.''
   In an interview with local reporters, Bush said the U.S. action
was ``proportional and rather swift.''
   ``We're not going to back down, nor will the allies with us in
the Gulf,'' Bush said. ``We cannot be pressured out of our
responsibilities by madmen like (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi or,
in today's news, (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini.''
   Bush defended his decision to campaign instead of remaining in
Washington to monitor Persian Gulf developments. Aides said he
would interrupt a Tuesday campaign swing through Pennsylvania to
attend a midday National Security Council meeting in Washington.
   Even though he has a lock on the GOP nomination, with former
television evangelist Pat Robertson offering only token opposition,
Bush has been campaigning anyway _ mostly in populous states which
are important in the general election.
   In Cleveland, Bush toured the Cleveland Clinic and was briefed
on research into artificial hearts.
   He also spoke at a Lithuanian meeting hall, sharing the stage
with Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican who is seeking
to unseat Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   But the events in the Persian Gulf dominated Bush's day as he
repeatedly sought to characterize the U.S. action as provoked.
   ``I was glad we were standing up to a radical muslim in the
Persian Gulf today,'' he said at the Lithuanian hall in Cleveland.
He added that he was proud to serve with a president who knew that
``sometimes the United States and only the United States can stand
for freedom.''
   ``We don't seek a confrontation with Iran but we're going to
meet our obligations and live up to our commitments. And we hope
the Iranians draw the proper and appropriate conclusion,'' he told
the Toledo Rotary Club.
   Iran must be prepared to ``pay a price'' for its aggression, he
said. He accused Iran of ``irresponsible behavior'' in resuming
mine-laying operations.
   ``The alternative (to striking back) is unthinkable for the free
world _ to sit and do nothing,'' Bush said.

   Refusal to meet the demands of gunmen who hijacked
a Kuwait Airways jetliner has become a source of national pride in
this Persian Gulf sheikdom.
   Some Kuwaitis also see it as vital to the survival of their
country, which is threatened by a 7{-year-old war between Iran and
Iraq that rages only 50 miles to the north. Iran accuses Kuwait of
aiding Iraq in the war and has attacked its main oil-export
terminal.
   ``I think Kuwait has set an example that you never, ever
negotiate with terrorists,'' said Faisal Al-Marzouk, editor of the
newspaper Al-Anbaa.
   ``I think it's unfortunate that the United States, West Germany,
France have always wanted to negotiate the release of hostages held
in Lebanon,'' he said in an interview.
   For two weeks this land of about 1.7 million residents, only 40
percent of whom are citizens, has rejected the demands of hijackers
who seized the Boeing 747 on April 5. It now is at the airport in
Algiers.
   The gunmen want Kuwait to free 17 pro-Iranians convicted of
bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983 in return for the
plane and about 35 hostages still held on it, including three
members of Kuwait's royal family. They have killed two Kuwaiti
passengers and have said they would massacre the rest.
   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, ordered financial
aid Monday for the families of the two men slain by the hijackers.
   A government statment said the emir ordered that all outstanding
debts of the two victims and their families be written off and that
the full salaries of the slain men be paid to their families.
   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a visiting Kuwaiti soccer team
offered to replace the hostages.
   Malaysia's Bernama news agency said the 52-member team,
competing for the Asian Cup, released a statement saying the
members would ``sacrifice themselves'' for their country.
   It reported the Kuwaiti team's president, Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmad
Al-Jabar Al-Sabah, a younger brother of the emir, said the soccer
players were ready to depart for Algeria.
   A senior Western diplomat said many Kuwaitis view the hijacking
as an affront.
   ``The Kuwaitis aren't going to back down. It's a matter of
national pride,'' said another with extensive official contacts.
   Al-Marzouk, the editor, said: ``Even if they kill all the
hostages on the plane, we'll never, ever release the killers who
are here in Kuwait.''
   Several previous attempts have been made to force the release of
the 17 prisoners, who were convicted in 1984. Three are sentenced
to death.
   Lebanese extremists believed related to some of the 17 hijacked
a Kuwait Airways jetliner in December 1984 on a flight from Dubai
to Karachi, Pakistan, and force it to Tehran. The five-day ordeal
ended when Iranian security men entered the plane in disguise and
surprised the hijackers. Two of the four Americans on board were
killed by the terrorists.
   Release of the imprisoned bombers also has been set as a
condition for freeing American hostages held by Moslem extremists
in Lebanon.
   Kuwait even refused to grant Church of England envoy Terry Waite
a visa in 1985 when he asked to come and discuss his efforts to
free foreign hostages. Waite disappeared in Beirut in January 1987
and is believed held hostage.
   U.S. officials who sold weapons to Iran to try to free the
Americans are said to have pressed Kuwait briefly, but
unsuccessfully, to release the prisoners.
   Diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited several
reasons for Kuwait's hard line:
   _ As a rich but weak country close to powerful and often hostile
neighbors, it cannot afford to become a target of blackmail.
   _ Kuwaiti officials have expressed fear that, ``if they knuckled
under ... they would put every civilized country at risk.''
   _ Fear that bowing to the hijackers would create conflict in
Kuwait between the majority Sunni and minority Shiite Moslem sects.
Kuwait is ruled by Sunnis but many of its Shiite minority are
ethnic Iranians, and Iran is predominantly Shiite.
   ``They're just not going to let their country go the way of
Lebanon,'' which has been ravaged by civil war since 1975, a
European diplomat said.

   Suporters of retired autoworker John Demjanjuk
said Monday that his conviction in Israel on war crimes charges
would arouse anti-Semitic feelings in America.
   ``I think people will be outraged because they know Demjanjuk is
innocent,'' said Peter Jacyk of Toronto, who helped raise money for
Demjanjuk's defense.
   ``In the long run, it will have a very negative effect on Israel
and Jews. It will definitely be long-remembered,'' Jacyk said.
   A panel of Israeli judges on convicted Demjanjuk on Monday of
war crimes, saying they had no doubt that he was the sadistic death
camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible,'' who killed 850,000 Jews during
World War II.
   Demjanjuk, 68, a Ukrainian immigrant who lived in suburban
Cleveland before being stripped of his citizenship, is scheduled
for sentencing April 25. He faces death or life imprisonment.
   Bill Liscynesky of the Cleveland suburb of Parma, who heads the
local United Ukrainian Organizations, said the conviction was
``bound to have a negative effect on the American population's view
of Israel.''
   ``The majority of Americans feel that Demjanjuk is innocent,''
Liscynesky said.
   The United Ukrainian Organization is an umbrella group for 48
Ukrainian groups in greater Cleveland that have about 20,000 active
members, Liscynsky said. He said ``telephones are probably very
hot'' spreading the word among local Ukrainians about Demjanjuk's
conviction Monday.
   More than 200 people gathered Sunday at St. Vladimir's Cathedral
in Parma, a Ukrainian Orthodox church, to pray for Demjanjuk and
his family.
   A former Cleveland lawyer who helped win Demjanjuk's extradition
to Israel in 1986 said Demjanjuk was justly treated by Israel and
deserved to be convicted.
   ``I think there was no doubt that he was given a fair trial,
that every possible defense was raised and thoroughly defended,''
said Alvin Lodish, a former Justice Department lawyer who now is in
private practice in Miami. ``There can be no doubt who John
Demjanjuk really is.''
   Demjanjuk's former attorney, Mark O'Connor of Buffalo, N.Y.,
said Demjanjuk's lawyers would need to alter their defense away
from emotionally attacking prosecutors and judges.
   ``It can't be said that he (Demjanjuk) didn't have every
opportunity to present evidence,'' said O'Connor. ``He could not
have had fairer trial.''
   The Albany, N.Y., chapter of the Holocaust Survivors and Friends
in Pursuit of Justice, which has 3,000 members across the country,
applauded the verdict.
   ``We commend the state of Israel for accepting this
reponsibility, and we hope they will continue to prosecute Nazi war
criminals who have found haven throughout the world,'' the group
said in a statement as read by Deborah Rausch, who had attended
part of the trial.
   In New York City, Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the conviction was ``gratifying
evidence that even 40 years after the Holocaust, justice can
prevail over evil.''
   Elizabeth Holtzman, the Brooklyn district attorney, said thee
verdict sent ``the world a signal that Nazi war criminals cannot
escape.''
   As a member of Congress, Holtzman was author of an amendment
allowing for the deportation of Nazi war criminals from the United
States and barring those linked to Nazi atrocities from entering
the country.

   President Reagan said Monday he ordered
military strikes against Iranian targets because of ``irresponsible
behavior'' toward U.S. ships, and served notice that Tehran will
``pay a price'' for such aggression in the Persian Gulf.
   Defending attacks on Iranian military platforms in the southern
gulf, Reagan said: ``We aim to deter further Iranian aggression,
not provoke it.'' He renewed the U.S. call for Iran to accept a
United Nations resolution demanding a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq
war.
   Reagan used an appearance before a business audience to comment
on U.S. reprisals for the mining of the frigate USS Samuel B.
Roberts. His use of force won bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.
   ``I have something in the nature of a bulletin for you,'' he
told representatives of the Associated General Contractors
organization in the Old Executive Office Building auditorium.
   ``Earlier today, our Navy made a measured response to Iran's
latest use of military force against U.S. ships in international
waters as well as its continued military and terrorist attacks
against a number of nonbelligerents,'' Reagan said.
   ``We've taken this action to make certain the Iranians have no
illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior,'' Reagan said.
   ``They must know that we will protect our ships, and if they
threaten us, they'll pay a price,'' Reagan said. The president told
his audience that ``a more normal relationship with Iran is
desirable _ and we're prepared for it.''
   But Reagan said that ``such a relationship is not possible so
long as Iran attacks neutral ships, threatens its neighbors,
supports terrorism and refuses to end the bloody war with Iraq.''
   Besides destroying the two offshore Iranian oil platforms used
for military purposes, the U.S. Navy either sank or damaged four
small Iranian gunboats and bombed two Iranian navy frigates that
had fired missiles at U.S. planes. Iran attacked oil facilities off
Sharjah and fired on at least two U.S. vessels.
   No American injuries or fatalities were reported, but Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said a Cobra attack helicopter with two
crewmen aboard was late in returning to a Navy cruiser and that a
search had been mounted for the aircraft.
   The Pentagon said the helicopter had been on a routine
surveillance mission from the cruiser Wainwright in the lower
central gulf, and that there was no indication the aircraft had
become involved in hostile action.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, in a dispatch
Monday night, said Iranian warships ``in a heroic clash with the
aggressor American helicopters in the Persian Gulf shot down one of
them Monday afternoon.''
   Pentagon spokesman Maj. Bill O'Connell said Monday night that
the Pentagon was aware of the Iranian claim but said, ``We have
nothing on that. The search is still under way.''
   Carlucci described as ``foolhardy behavior'' Iran's decision to
escalate the fighting. He said he assumed the attacks could only be
explained as stemming from fanaticism.
   Carlucci said three of the small Iranian craft were attacked by
a Navy A-6 Intruder jet after observing them attack commercial
vessels and oil rigs off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.
   That confrontation occurred around 7:30 a.m. EDT, Carlucci said,
or about 6{ hours after U.S. forces attacked the Iranian offshore
platforms.
   Navy jets were assigned to patrol the area after reports were
received indicating an American commercial boat, the Willi Tide,
had been attacked, Carlucci said.
   Asked if he were surprised by the Iranian decision to confront
U.S. forces directly, the secretary replied: ``I wouldn't use the
word surprised because the Iranians have been known to engage in
this kind of, frankly, foolhardy behavior before.''
   The National Association of Arab Americans said in Washington
that it regretted the rising violence in the gulf, but that the
U.S. military response was ``appropriate in light of our vital
security interests and Iran's continued belligerence.''
   ``The stakes are very high, and the U.S. cannot permit Iran to
impede the free flow of oil in the gulf,'' association president
George Moses said in a statement.
   There were no immediate indications of American or Iranian
casualties from Monday's fighting.
   The incident was the second such outbreak of violence since the
United States began escorting oil tankers through the gulf last
July to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the
7{-year Iran-Iraq war.
   On Oct. 19, a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack
on a Kuwaiti ship flying the U.S. flag in which 18 Americans were
injured. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what Reagan at
the time termed a ``prudent'' response.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said Monday
that the United States sent a message to Iran warning that any
``further provocation or hostile Iranian military or terrorist
action against U.S. personnel or targets will receive a firm U.S.
response.''
   The message said the mine explosion that damaged the Roberts had
followed repeated warnings by the United States to Iran about the
consquences of placing mines in international waters of the Persian
Gulf.
   Redman said that before Monday's retaliatory action, the United
States had notified Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and
Belgium of its intentions. All have naval vessels in the gulf.
Others, including the Soviet Union, were notified at the time the
action commenced, he said.
   Democratic and Republican congressional leaders said they felt
Reagan's actions were fully justified. Several said they were
pleased that Reagan consulted with them on Sunday night before
acting.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said: ``The
Iranians were carrying out terrorist acts. ... I support the
decision to destroy the (Iranian oil drilling) platforms.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he hoped that
Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ``gets
that message so we can all avoid further bloodshed and violence.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, talking to reporters in
the early morning hours, had said Reagan acted only after the
United States gathered ``conclusive evidence'' that Iran was
responsible for the mining of the Roberts.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the White House
discussions were ``very frank'' and that the congressional leaders
pointed out the perils as well as the possible benefits of military
action.
   But Wright said of Reagan: ``He is the commander in chief and
when action is taken by the United States, it certainly behooves
all of us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a nation
that is united.''
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson voiced criticism
of the operation, however, telling reporters in New York that the
fighting with Iran raised fresh questions about U.S. policy in the
region.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, dashing across New
York Monday on the eve of the state's primary, state, backed off on
an initial statement calling the U.S. attack on Iranian oil
platforms a ``measured response.''
   The Massachusetts governor declined to comment on the Middle
East developments at two news conferences he held during a long day
of campaigning.
   But aides confirmed that he had told one reporter early in the
day that he considered the U.S. move a ``measured response.''
   Late in the day, Dukakis declined to meet with reporters on his
campaign plane who wanted to question him about the initial
statement, sending aides instead.
   Madeleine Albright, his senior foreign policy adviser, said
Dukakis altered his position on the initial attack because of
subsequent events.
   In exchanges that continued throughout the day on Monday,
American forces destroyed two of Iran's Persian Gulf oil platforms,
sank or damaged four attack boats and disabled two frigates that
fired missiles at American planes, U.S. officials reported.
   ``The feeling was that so many pieces of this story were hard to
put together, that it was hard to figure out what the whole story
was, and so he felt he didn't want to continue with the initial
statement,'' Albright said.
   Asked whether Dukakis stood by the early statement, she said,
``A combination of several series of escalations make one question
whether it was an appropriate reaction.''
   Dukakis would not come to the rear of his airplane to meet with
reporters to explain the situtation. When questioned by a reporter
getting off his airplane in New York Monday night, he referred
questions to press secretary Mark Gearan.
   During the day, Dukakis, who has been accused by rival Albert
Gore Jr. of inexperience in foreign policy matters, talked with
aides about the situation in the Persian Gulf, but said little
about the subject.
   ``We just don't have sufficient information for me to comment on
what's happened in the Middle East in the last few days, and it
would just be inappropriate for me to comment,'' he said.
   He continued to avoid the issue and spoke with extreme caution
to reporters aboard his plane on Middle East questions, including
about reports that Israel was behind the slaying of a Palestine
Liberation Organization official in Tunisia.
   Asked if he would consider such an assassination morally wrong,
he said: ``I don't want to answer hypotheticals on that. I don't
have the facts.''
   Dukakis spent Monday making stops in major television markets in
a bid to get maximum exposure just before New York's important
Democratic presidential primary. Late polls showed him leading
Jesse Jackson and far ahead of Gore.
   ``Just don't forget to vote tomorrow,'' he told workers at the
American Brass Co. in Buffalo, where he spoke to workers on the
floor of the brass mill.
   ``If we can win tomorrow with your help, we're going to be on
our way to the nomination, and I have no doubt that the Democratic
nominee for the presidency is going to beat George Bush in
November,'' he said.
   Aides continued to suggest the race in New York was tightening
between Dukakis and Jackson, although Dukakis told reporters, ``I'm
always optimistic.''
   From Buffalo, he flew back to Manhattan and a noontime crowd in
the heart of the financial district with cousin Olympia Dukakis,
the Oscar-winning actress.
   Dukakis made appearances in Syracuse, where he called for
greater drug education efforts, and Rochester, where he told a
college crowd that voter turnout was the key on Tuesday.
   Olympia Dukakis, mentioned by her cousin at nearly every
campaign stop, used Greek to praise the Massachusetts governor to a
crowd gathered on a drizzly day in the small Nassau Street mall
near Wall Street.
   ``She's given us our battle cry _ `Let's go, Mike,''' he said,
paraphrasing her words at the Academy Awards ceremony a week ago.
   Dukakis compared himself to John Kennedy as a son of
Massachusetts running for president and said, ``History is going to
repeat itself in 1988.''
   Dukakis visited Buffalo two days after throwing out a ceremonial
first pitch _ which landed in the dirt in front of the batter's box
_ at a Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball game Saturday in the
city's new outdoor baseball stadium. Back on Monday, he called the
ball park ``a terrifc example of Buffalo coming back'' and adressed
local hopes to land a big-league team.
   ``I can't make this as a commitment, but I want to say this to
you: If Michael Dukakis is elected president, I'll do what I can to
get a major league team to Buffalo,'' Dukakis said.
   At the American Brass Co. plant, he praised cooperation between
labor and management following a buy-out by management.
   He repeated his support for federal legislation, as in
Massachusetts, requiring notice before plants are closed.

   Federal Aviation Administration officials began
inspecting Continental Airlines planes Monday, extending an
investigation that began last week with Eastern Airlines.
   Continental and Eastern are subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp.,
which is under investigation by the Transportation Department to
determine if its management and finances meet federal standards.
   Also Monday, credit analysts indicated they might downgrade
about $1.3 billion of Texas Air and Continental Airlines debt
because of recent financial losses and the Transportation
Department investigation, among other things.
   Texas Air had record losses of $466 million last year, including
$241 million at Eastern. Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has been
seeking major cost concessions from Eastern's union, but the unions
so far have resisted.
   No significant inspection-related flight delays were reported
Monday in the 351-plane Continental system, said company spokesman
Bruce Hicks.
   And in Miami, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said she had
not heard of any major problems with that carrier.
   The inspectors were too busy to talk to reporters, other FAA
officials said. ``They are doing their job; they are too
preoccupied,'' said FAA spokesman Dick Stafford in Washington.
   During an appearance Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the department had
inspected about 200 of Eastern's 267 aircraft, and grounded 19 of
them.
   Burnley said the Continental and Eastern inspections would be
very similar.
   ``We'll have people who'll be walking around the planes and
through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks
in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily
identified is correct,'' Burnley said.
   FAA officials had no more up-to-date figures Monday on
inspections of Eastern planes, nor of Continental inspections.
   Lorenzo said on ``Meet The Press'' that the company has been
trying to adjust to the marketplace rigors of deregulation, and has
said Eastern's unions are ``out just to tear the airline down.''
   He said Continental would cooperate with the inspection, just as
Eastern has done.
   Standard & Poor's placed Texas Air and Continental Airlines debt
on its special credit watch Monday. Standard & Poor's said
financial losses, recent court rulings, and the federal
investigation may hinder Texas Air's ability to win wage
concessions from Eastern employees.
   At the end of 1987, Texas Air and its operating units held about
$850 million in cash and marketable securities, and were not
expected to have trouble meeting debt maturities this year,
Standard & Poor's said.
   While Texas Air's corporate structure insulates the parent
company somewhat from financial problems at its subsidiaries,
further delays in resolving Eastern's labor problems or continued
financial losses at Continental could affect Texas Air's long-term
ability to compete, Standard & Poor's said.
   ``We are trying to present the situation as accurately as we
can,'' said Philip Baggaley, spokesman for Standard & Poor's.
   So far, Eastern has been slapped with $823,000 in fines for
violating safety regulations. On Sunday, Burnley said the
Transportation Department found nearly $1 million in violations by
Continental during a review of the carrier's files.
   Burnley said Continental had been notified of the penalties, and
the airline was considering whether to pay them voluntarily,
Burnley said.
   In addition to Continental and Eastern, Texas Air owns Rocky
Mountain Airways, Britt Airways, Bar Harbor Airlines and
Provincetown-Boston Airlines.

<HEAD>Silent Screen Actress Eva Novak Dead At 90</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silent movie actress Eva Novak, who starred
as Tom Mix's love interest in 10 of his Westerns and did her own
stunts as well, has died after a bout with pneumonia. She was 90.
   Miss Novak died Sunday evening at the Motion Picture Country
Hospital in Los Angeles, said producer Walter Seltzer, whose wife
is a niece of the actress.
   Miss Novak and her sister, Jane, came to Hollywood from their
native St. Louis in their mid-teens to become stars of the silent
era, Seltzer said.
   Eva worked in slapstick comedies and was a bathing beauty for
Mack Sennett. Among her films as leading lady for Tom Mix were
``Sky High,'' and ``Trailin'.'' She also was the leading lady in
three films for William S. Hart.
   In those early Westerns, Miss Novak performed all her own
stunts, relying on advice from Mix.
   In 1921 she married director and stuntman William Reed, and the
couple went to Australia in the late 1920s and made a series of
Westerns there.
   She returned to the United States in the 1930s and appeared in
several talking films with such new stars as Jack Benny.
   She also played numerous parts for director John Ford, an old
friend who cast her in such classics as ``She Wore A Yellow
Ribbon,'' ``Stagecoach,'' and ``Fort Apache.'' She also played a
nun in ``The Bells of St. Mary's.''
   In 1980, when she was 82, she was assigned by the Republican
party to work in her neighborhood in Sherman Oaks on behalf of
Ronald Reagan, an old friend and fellow Screen Actors Guild board
member.
   Miss Novak is survived by her sister, Jane, two daughters, 10
grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
   A private memorial mass on Wednesday will be followed by burial
at San Fernando Mission Cemetery.

<HEAD>Teen Back In Public School After Furor Over AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old hemophiliac who had a a
positive test for AIDS was back in public school Monday, seven
months after a furor prompted his parents to pull him out of
classes, a school official said.
   DeWayne Mowery, who had been taking classes alone, is enrolled
at Clinton Junior High School, said Ann McRae, supervisor of
special education at Anderson County schools.
   He is expected to finish the school year there, she said.
   Health officials have said DeWayne, who has not shown symptoms
of AIDS in spite of the positive test, apparently got the virus
through contaminated clotting factor. The substance is made from a
blood component.
   Staff, students and parents there feel equipped to deal with
DeWayne's situation because they have been attending special
programs, organized by the principal, Harold Heath, to learn about
AIDS and about hemophilia, said Ms. McRae.
   Last fall, DeWayne attended Lake City Middle School for three
days, but his parents pulled him out after they said the family had
received threats.
   During that time many parents kept their children from classes,
and angry parents and students picketed the school grounds. DeWayne
was driven to a back entrance of the small school.
   Last month, Norma Mowery, DeWayne's mother, attended a hearing
in Nashville of President Reagan's AIDS commission and told the
panel she resented that her son did not have access to education
that included socializing with other children.
   She told the commission that any child ``should not have to
sneak around and go to the back door to get into school. He should
not have to be afraid for his life because he wants to learn.''
   Before Monday, DeWayne had been riding a bus alone to meet with
his teacher at an Anderson County special school. He was the only
student in the classes.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring. As of April 11, 33,060
people have died of AIDS in the United States.

   Louise Nevelson, a artist who struggled until
she was nearly 60 to win the public's attention, died Sunday at age
88.
   Mrs. Nevelson traveled to Munich to study. Upon the rise of the
Nazis, she returned to New York to work with paint, plaster, terra
cotta, marble, aluminum, bronze and bits of wood.
   Although Mrs. Nevelson was a serious artist for half a century,
her work was largely ignored until 1958, when it was included in an
anthology at the Museum of Modern Art. Her fame grew in 1959 when,
at the age of 60, she won acclaim for her first all-white
``environment,'' titled ``Dawn's Wedding Feast.''
   She recently completed a 35-foot black steel sculpture for the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her 1950s
work is scheduled this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mrs.
Nevelson's works are included in the collections of many major
museums and have been taken on exhibitions around the nation and

   A candidate for the state Senate
abandoned his vigil on a bridge he said was threatened by erosion
and pulled out of the race Monday, saying his protest had turned
attention away from the bridge.
   ``I don't want to take away from the problem down here,'' Dan
Lawrence said as he announced he would support his rival for the
Senate, state Sen. Marc Basnight. Lawrence is a Republican and
Basnight a Democrat.
   ``I don't want even one person to feel that this was done as a
political stunt, (to) detract from the great need we have to save
this bridge and save this island,'' he said.
   Lawrence started his vigil Friday by chaining himself to a
catwalk that adjoins the 2{-mile Herbert Bonner Bridge, the only
link between the northern end of the Outer Banks and Hatteras
Island.
   He said he had not anticipated the problems that plagued his
protest, which included poor weather and a death threat on Sunday
night. Following the threat, Lawrence returned for a short time
Sunday night before going back to the bridge for the final hours of
his vigil.
   ``I'm giving up, folks. I'm going home. My family has suffered a
lot,'' he said. ``I can't take it anymore. I'm hungry.''
   Lawrence was concerned that the onslaught of the Atlantic Ocean
would lead to further erosion that would not only eat away at the
coastline, but undermine bridge supports. State Department of
Transportation officials say the bridge is not in danger of
collapse, and that periodic checks of the supports are made to
ensure that any damage can be repaired as soon as possible.
   Before the bridge was built in 1962, residents along the coast
had to rely on ferry boats.

   Michael Dukakis predicted Monday he would post a
``great victory'' in the New York primary that would place him
firmly on the road to the Democratic presidential nomination, but
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. exhorted their supporters to
deliver a poll-defying upset.
   In its final 24 hours, the campaign was nothing if not blunt.
New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Gore supporter who has sharply criticized
Jackson in recent days, was branded a ``lunatic'' by Jackson's
campaign manager.
   Jackson said Koch's comments about him have ``not been good for
the city or the campaign.'' He also said the atmosphere in the
primary campaign has become ``so divisive and so violent'' that he
is getting more death threats than at any time in his presidential
campaign.
   Jackson, who generally receives more threats than the other
candidates, travels with very tight security.
   Jackson, meanwhile, went into the New York contest a winner. He
beat out Dukakis in Monday night's Democratic caucuses in Delaware,
taking 45 percent to Dukakis' 27 percent. Gore was a distant third
with 2 percent.
   Dukakis, the leader in all the pre-election polls, steered well
clear of the Jackson-Gore-Koch hostilities. But he caused a flap
when he refused to meet with reporters to discuss his early-morning
comment to one reporter that the U.S. action in the Persian Gulf as
a ``measured response.''
   On Monday, in a series of engagements, American forces destroyed
two of Iran's Persian Gulf oil platforms, sank or damaged four
attack boats and disabled two frigates that fired missiles at
American planes, U.S. officials reported.
   At appearances throughout the day, Dukakis said too little was
known about the situation for him to comment. When reporters on his
campaign plane learned of his initial remark and wanted to talk to
Dukakis about it, he dispatched an aide to tell them the early
comment had been outdated by events in the gulf.
   ``Just don't forget to vote tomorrow,'' the Massachusetts
governor told an audience in Buffalo as he barnstormed through the
final day of a costly, contentious primary campaign marked by
racial and religious divisions.
   Jackson, running second to Dukakis in the public opinion polls,
staged three get-out-the-vote rallies in soggy Harlem. ``If you
will stand in the rain today you will vote in the rain
tomorrow...We've come too close, nothing can stop us now,'' he said.
   The late pre-election polls gave Dukakis a lead over Jackson
measured in double digits with Gore a distant third, but even so
the pollsters fretted.
   ``Nobody can predict for sure what the final combination of
blacks, Jews, Hispanics and white Catholics will be,'' said ABC
News pollster John Brennan. ``We could all be wrong. New York is a
killer.''
   Gore, struggling for survival in the Democratic race, sought to
place some distance between himself and the critical comments made
by Koch. ``The mayor is speaking for himself,'' the Tennessee
senator said as the two men campaigned side by side.
   On the final rounds of a million-dollar campaign, Gore endorsed
President Reagan's decision to take military action against Iran in
the Persian Gulf. He said the administration has ``every right'' to
do what it did.
   Koch was asked repeatedly about his weekend comments criticizing
Jackson. ``I'm not saying he's a liar. I'm saying he can't stand
stress, and then he lies under stress,'' he said.
   He later said that if nominated, Jackson would lead the
Democratic party to its ``worst defeat'' since the Republican
landslide year of 1972.
   In a speech to the non-partisan Association for a Better New
York, Jackson never mentioned Koch by name but referred to ``those
who are inclined because of their fears to be bent toward
hysteria.''
   He went on, ``Leaders must set a high moral tone. I will not
surrender that tone to diversions.''
   But his campaign manager, Gerald Austin, was less diplomatic.
``Koch is a lunatic. By New York standards he is a lunatic,'' he
said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has spoken warmly of all three
contenders but endorsed no one, weighed in from Albany, saying that
Koch's tactic of ``attacking Jesse Jackson's character'' might
boomerang. Cuomo said he felt Gore chances had been hurt in New
York because the Tennessee senator ``has been obscured by negative
smoke going up from attacks on others.''
   While most eyes were on New York and the 255 Democratic National
Convention delegates at stake in the primary, Delaware Democrats
began the process of selecting 15 delegates to the party convention
next summer.
   On the Republican side, nominee-for-sure George Bush spent the
day campaigning in Ohio, which holds its primary on May 3. Asked
about the air raid against Gulf platforms, he said, ``Our people
understand it is appropriate to have a proper response when our
obligation is protection of sea lanes.'' The vice president has no
active opposition for the GOP nomination.
   Dukakis leads the competition for Democratic National Convention
delegates with 872, compared with 738 for Jackson and 417 for Gore,
with 2,082 needed for nomination.
   He has scored consecutive primary victories in Connecticut and
Wisconsin and caucus triumphs in Colorado and Arizona in the past
few weeks, and is looking for a New York victory to certify him as
the front-runner and prohibitive favorite in the Democratic race.
   ``We're looking forward to a great victory tomorrow here in the
state of New York, and we're going to get it,'' he said in Buffalo.
   ``If we can win here tomorrow with your help, we're going to be
on our way to the nomination, and I have no doubt that the
Democratic nominee for the presidency is going to beat George Bush
in November,'' he said. From there, he traveled to New York for a
rally with cousin Olympia Dukakis, who was awarded an Oscar last
week for her role in the movie ``Moonstruck.''
   Turnout was the big unknown in efforts to predict the outcome on
Tuesday and Jackson spent the last full day of campaigning trying
to keep enthusiasm high.
   The three Democrats also offered differing responses to the
administration military action in the Persian Gulf.
   Jackson said the early morning fighting with Iran raised new
questions about U.S. policy. He said the weapons used against
American troops were ``no doubt sold Iran illegally by the
Reagan-Bush administration.''
   Gore said, ``Based on the facts presently available, I think the
response was an appropriate one. It was a proportionate response
for a clear act of hostility by Iran in laying mines intended to
damage our ships and threaten the lives of our sailors.''
   Dukakis said, ``We just don't have sufficient information for me
to comment on what's happened in the Middle East in the last few
days, and it would just be inappropriate for me to comment.''
However, aides confirmed late Monday that he had initially
characterized U.S. action in the gulf as a ``measured response.''

   A search for two Ohio National Guardsmen

after searchers failed to find the men.
   Lt. George Dupree of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cleveland office

   ``Unless we find more evidence that would warrant our going out

civilian boats before the start of the 4th U.S. Army rifle matches.
Start of the matches was suspended until a search was finished.
   National Guard spokesman Don Lundy said the men are members of

They were identified as Sgt. Melvin E. Wisecup, 31, of Waynesfield,
and Spec. 4 Wayne C. Wingate, 30, of Lima.

<HEAD>Soviet Journal Publishes Previously Withheld Einstein Letter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the first time, a Soviet journal has printed a
letter written by Albert Einstein 40 years ago in response to
criticism by Soviet scientists.
   In the letter, included in the April 15 edition of the weekly
New Times, the physicist called on the Soviet Union to join the
United States in supporting international security measures for
atomic weapons.
   The editors of New Times said in a note that they were
publishing the letter because Einstein's thoughts are ``unusually
in keeping with our times.''
   They said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had noted that a
``mistake was allowed when we didn't heed Einstein and like-minded
people. They warned that the world had amassed such force that a
new approach was needed.''
   Einstein, who urged then-U.S. President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt to explore the use of atomic energy for bombs, was
attacked by four Soviet scientists in the Nov. 26, 1947, edition of
New Times, but his response was not published.
   Soviet dictator Josef V. Stalin was in power at the time, and
his government kept dissident opinions out of the press.
   Gorbachev's police of ``glasnost,'' or openness, has encouraged
a more honest assessment of past mistakes and freer expression
about reforming Soviet society.
   Einstein said in his response that to guard against war, a world
government should be created to ensure that global and not national
interests were dominant. He said the Soviet Union and United States
should put aside their ideological differences and work together
for peace.
   ``Isn't it truly unavoidable because of our fright and inherited
habits that we are doomed to destroy one another, so that nothing
will be left to preserve?'' he said.
   ``Doesn't that mean that all our disagreements and differences
of opinion which we touched on in our strange exchange of letters
are insignificantly minute compared to the danger threatening all
of us?''

   Federal investigators have compiled evidence
suggesting the nation's hospitals are making billions of dollars
extra by admitting patients who could be treated better and cheaper
without hospitalization.
   A draft report prepared by the inspector general's office of the
Department of Health and Human Services concludes that hospitals
probably were paid about $2 billion by Medicare in 1985 to treat
patients who should not have been hospitalized in the first place.
   ``Although an estimated $939 million would have been spent
providing care to these patients in other medical settings,
reducing unnecessary admissions to hospitals is one of the most

   The army restricted travel today in most of the
occupied territories and clamped a curfew on about 20 refugee camps
in an effort to halt widespread protests after the assassination of
a senior PLO commander.
   Israeli leaders refused to comment Sunday on the slaying of
Khalil al-Wazir in Tunisia. But Israeli sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the attack on Saturday in a Tunis
suburb was carried out by the Israeli Mossad intelligence service,
the navy and an elite commando unit.
   Al-Wazir, 52, also called Abu Jihad, was the most senior
Palestine Liberation Organization official assassinated since
Fatah, the largest guerrilla group in the PLO, was founded in 1964.
He was PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's closest aide, led the group's
main army, and supervised military operations inside the occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank.

   While workers put the finishing touches on this
city's new pastel-pink basketball arena, about 700 ragged, hungry
men a block away cling to the gate of a homeless shelter waiting
for the day's only meal.
   For five years, city planners have tried to move the shelter in
the Overtown section _ scene of the 1982 riots _ for fear families
venturing downtown to watch NBA stars like Larry Bird or Magic
Johnson will be hassled by vagrants, beggars and drug addicts.
   ``I'm sure the shelter is doing fine work, but some of the
clientele tend to congregate on the sidewalk all day,'' said
Matthew Schwartz, deputy director of Miami's Department of
Development. ``It's an environment that's simply not conducive to
the arena, the area development or any kind of business.''

   Contra rebel leaders said they
rejected a government proposal for a permanent truce because the
document failed to spell out the democratic reforms the Sandinistas
would adopt.
   Government negotiators offered the plan Sunday during the third
day of cease-fire talks, the first held in Managua since fighting
broke out in 1981.
   Although the rebels rejected the government offer, both sides
returned to the bargaining table and met Sunday night and into
today behind closed doors at the Camino Real Hotel on the outskirts
of Managua.
   Before talks resumed Sunday, the Contras said the Sandinistas
must take steps _ or at least guarantee them during a truce _ to
return Nicaragua to democratic, elected rule. ``We reject the
Sandinista proposal because it speaks only of cease-fire and no
other issues, such as the true democratization of Nicaragua,'' said
Adolfo Calero, head of the rebel delegation.

   Iraq said its forces Monday retook the town
of Faw near the tip of a strategic Iraqi peninsula that had been
captured by Iran more than two years ago.
   Iran claimed U.S. helicopters attacked Iranian troops and Kuwait
provided a staging area to support the Iraqi offensive. The United
States and Kuwait denied the charge.
   Thousands of Iranians were killed or wounded in the two-day-old
offensive, named ``Blessed Ramadan'' after the Moslem fasting
month, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
   It was the first time Iraq took the initiative in a major ground
push since the early years of the 7{-year-old war.

   Army curfews and strikes to protest the killing
of a PLO leader paralyzed the occupied lands Monday, and hospital
officials said soldiers shot two Arabs to death, including a woman
who was taking her children home.
   At least 167 Palestinians have been reported killed since riots
began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has
occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war. An Israeli soldier and civilian also have been
slain.
   Israel ordered the closure of Jerusalem's only English-language
magazine owned by Palestinians, alleging that it is financed and
directed by terrorist organizations. Its managing editor denied the
allegations.
   Buildings in the West Bank were draped with black flags of
mourning for assassinated PLO leader Khalil al-Wazir. Hundreds of
Palestinians paid condolence calls in Nablus to al-Wazir's cousin
during three days of mourning, said Adnan Zahran of Nablus.

   The Roman Catholic Church's tax-exempt status
gives it an unfair advantage in the political battle over abortion
rights, the Supreme Court was told Monday.
   The court was urged by a ``pro-choice'' coalition to keep alive
an 8-year-old lawsuit that seeks to strip the church of its tax
exemption because of its anti-abortion lobbying.
   The suit is against the federal government, not the church.
   The justices are being asked to decide whether the suit can go
forward _ not whether the church's tax exemption should be revoked.
A decision is expected to be announced by July.

   A presidential commission concluded Monday
that the U.S. air transport system is safe for the time being, but
urged appointment of a ``safety czar'' in a newly independent
Federal Aviation Administration whose officials would be insulated
from political pressures.
   ``The nation's air transportation system is safe, for now,''
said John M. Albertine, chairman of the Aviation Safety Commission
whose final report was issued after a nine-month study of the
rapidly growing airline industry.
   ``However, that safety is being maintained to an increasing
extent through delays and through what I can only characterize as
heroic efforts of air traffic controllers, airways facilities
technicians, safety inspectors'' and others, Albertine said.
   The report said there was widespread public concern about the
safety of air travel, coinciding with burgeoning technological
advances and a backlog of safety improvements waiting to be written
into government regulations.

   Some banks opened for the first time
in six weeks Monday, but only to accept deposits, and people who
still have currency in this cash-poor economy were in no rush to
give it up.
   Business was brisk at a few major foreign banks, but slow at
institutions owned and operated by Panamanians.
   About 30 people were outside Chase Manhattan when it opened.
Virtually all were depositing checks they have been unable to cash
for 45 days because U.S. economic sanctions have dried up the money
supply in Panama, whose currency is the dollar.
   ``I'll keep my cash at home,'' said Frank Farrell, who is
retired and was depositing several dividend checks.``Later on,

   Penn State University's president
agreed Monday to drop charges against students arrested during a
sit-in protesting racial policy, but wouldn't commit new funds for
recruiting black students and faculty.
   ``Most of the students who occupied the building were motivated
by a genuine belief that immediate action was required to address
the concerns of Penn State's black community,'' university
President Bryce Jordan said in granting amnesty to the protesters.
   School admissions officials had expressed worry that the arrests
would discourage other blacks from attending the school.
   At an open meeting with his senior adminstrators and black
student leaders, Jordan defended his decision to end a 15-hour
sit-in at the university's telecommunications building April 9 by
arresting 89 protesters, most of them black students.

   Mrs. Nevelson, who had been in poor health for several months,
died Sunday at her home in Manhattan's Little Italy.

   Today is Saturday, April 30, the 121st day of 1988. There are
245 days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   Forty years ago, on April 30, 1948, the Organization of American
States, dedicated to promoting solidarity and peace among nations
in the Western Hemisphere, held its first meeting, in Bogota,
Colombia.
   On this date:
   In 1789, George Washington took office in New York as the first
President of the United States.
   In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory
from France.
   In 1812, Louisiana entered the Union as the 18th state.
   In 1900, Hawaii was organized as a U.S. territory.
   In 1900, engineer John Luther ``Casey'' Jones of the Illinois
Central Railroad was killed in a wreck near Vaughan, Miss., as he
stayed at his controls, trying to save the passengers.
   In 1939, the New York World's Fair, billed as a look at ``The
World of Tomorrow,'' officially opened.
   In 1945, as Russian troops approached his bunker in Berlin,
Adolf Hitler committed suicide along with his wife of one day, Eva
Braun.

   In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed a measure officially
changing the name of Boulder Dam to Hoover Dam.
   In 1968, police ended a week-long occupation of several
buildings at Columbia University in New York as they routed
left-wing student demonstrators.
   In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon announced the U.S. was
sending troops into Cambodia, an action that sparked widespread
protests.

Communist forces as President Duong Van Minh announced an
unconditional surrender.
   In 1980, three gunmen seized control of the Iranian embassy in
London, seizing about 20 hostages. (British commandos stormed the
building May 5.)
   In 1980, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands abdicated on her 71st
birthday. She was succeeded by her daughter, Princess Beatrix.

   After admitting he put words in President
Reagan's mouth while serving him as White House spokesman, Larry
Speakes has lost his job as chief spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co.
   The popular assumption for his resignation from the securities
firm is that such an admission would make less credible his future
statements on its behalf, and perhaps tarnish its image as well.
   But creating statements for the top guy has a long tradition in
the world of business.
   It is practiced every day without exception, and it is likely to
continue in practice. It has been used to protect the inarticulate
chairman, to promote an image that is inconsistent with the facts,
to impress viewers and listeners.
   Public relations executives regularly issue statements they
attribute to the chief, but which they themselves drafted and
``sold'' to the executive before issuing to the media.
   Few chief executives write their own speeches. Seldom do they
sit at a typewriter and knock out the magazines articles that
appear under their names. Few are capable of writing a best-selling
book.
   In fact, Professor Eugene Jennings, a business scholar and
adviser to top executives, commented recently that one item found
in most offices, but not in that of the corporate chief executive,
is a simple everyday dictionary.
   Even the company president's message to shareholders, that
staple of every annual report, is likely to have been drafted by a
writer assigned to the task. With an eye on history, even corporate
memos have been ghostwritten.
   Real estate publications carry advertisements of ghostwriters
who offer weekly columns of housing information designed for
publication under the real estate agent's name, as either
advertising or editorial matter.
   One ghostwriter advertisement in Realtor News, aimed at real
estate agents seeking to develop their business, carries the
customer endorsement that ``Your columns have paid back almost $100
for every dollar invested.''
   Newsletters proliferate under the logotype of local merchants,
especially those who sell directly to consumers. Some of them are
highly personalized to project a certain image of the person, which
might or might not be accurate.
   There is an easy explanation for all this: Writing often takes
too much time and effort. An executive who tried to write his or
her own material might lose sight of the bigger job, which is to
manage the company properly.
   But there are other reasons too, among them:
   Words can be misconstrued, so they must be chosen carefully.
Words chosen carefully can turn a negative into a positive.
Well-chosen words can make neat, memorable quotes, helping to get
the executive's message across to the public.
   But in most instances, there is a big difference between what
happens in the business world of ghost-written words and what
occurred at the White House level and got Speakes into trouble.
   Invariably, wise executives review material issued in their
name, because it is they who must stand behind it. Should they
attempt to blame the writer, they would immediately reveal
themselves as inadequate to their position.
   Speakes concedes that on two occasions President Reagan never
got to see his ``own'' material.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ There are some 5,000 so-called ``orphan
diseases'' affecting an estimated 20 million Americans. These are
the rare diseases that have failed to attract the millions of
research dollars needed to find cures or treatments because
individually they afflict relatively few people. But victims of
orphan diseases can now find help through the National Organization
for Rare Disorders.

   Abbey Meyers knows the suffering and
frustration that accompanies rare diseases that are often neglected
by drug manufacturers.
   Her three children suffer from Tourette syndrome, a disorder
characterized by involuntary muscular movements and vocal noises.
   In 1979, when her oldest son was 12, he received an experimental
drug that halted the symptoms. When it was announced that
production of the drug was to be halted, Meyers launched a
letter-writing campaign.
   In 1980, she founded the National Organization for Rare
Disorders, based in New Fairfield. Her efforts enabled her son and
other children to continue to receive the drug.
   NORD's goal is to help people suffering from the so-called
``orphan diseases,'' those rare ailments that have failed to
attract the millions of research dollars needed to find cures or
treatments because individually they afflict relatively few people.
   An orphan disease is one that afflicts less than 200,000 people.
There are 5,000 such diseases affecting an estimated 20 million
Americans, according to NORD.
   But the orphan diseases have started to attract greater interest
in recent years, thanks in part to the efforts of NORD.
   NORD is a clearinghouse for information on rare diseases. It
also makes referrals to rare disease support groups and works to
encourage development of drugs to treat rare diseases.
   The non-profit group began as an informal coalition of health
agencies and individuals. It incorporated in 1983 and opened its
office in 1985. It now has six full-time workers and an annual
budget of about $250,000.
   ``The public told us what they wanted us to be, otherwise we
would have remained an informal group,'' says Meyers, the NORD
executive director.
   The organization has information on 1,500 of the diseases.
Interested people can obtain information through the mail, or by
linking up with a computer data base run by NORD through CompuServe
in Columbus, Ohio.
   ``People tell us their symptoms,'' Meyers says. ``But we can't
help people unless they have a diagnosis. They must have a name for
their diseases.''
   Meyers says the rarest disease may be ``severe combined immune
deficiency,'' of which there are 27 known cases. A person afflicted
with this disease has no immunity to disease, like the Texas boy
who lived in a plastic bubble.
   Cystinosis is a genetic kidney disorder that affects about 70
children. Those afflicted with the disease used to die before their
10th birthday, but now live longer due to a new drug.
   Generally, Meyers says, rarest diseases are those known as
recessive hereditary disorders. These diseases result only when
both parents have defective genes, resulting in a one-in-four
chance that an offspring will suffer a rare ailment.
   Perhaps the most widespread of the recessive disorders is cystic
fibrosis, which affects 20,000 people.
   NORD uses medical librarians and others who read medical
journals and then rewrite the information on diseases in language
that lay people can understand. It doesn't have researchers of its
own doing any work on rare disorders.
   ``We do everything we can in ways that cost the least,'' Meyers
says.
   The organization also is actively involved in helping the
Federal Drug Administration and pharmaceutical companies work
together to develop drugs for rare diseases. That effort got a
boost with the 1983 passage of the Orphan Drug Act, which provides
tax incentives to companies that develop drugs for orphan diseases.
The law also provided $4 million this year for research grants.
   The drug companies previously ignored orphan diseases because
it's expensive to develop new drugs and because the market wasn't
large enough to produce big profits. It can cost up to $80 million
to develop a new drug, according to NORD.
   ``If there's a problem that crops up along the way, we'll act as
an intermediary,'' Meyers says.
   To date, the FAA has approved 183 orphan drug programs and 23
have resulted in medications ready for the market. The drawback to
the program is that these drugs are generally expensive. For
instance, it costs about $10,000 a year to supply a child suffering
from dwarfism with a growth hormone.
   The growth hormone price has remained high even though it has
become more popular than imagined. The drug is apparently being
used by some athletes to build muscles, Meyers says. The drug has
found a black market because it can't be detected like steroids,
which are illegal in sports competitions.
   NORD also is planning to fund its own clinical research program
later this year. The organization has raised $80,000 to get its
effort moving and Meyers says she's looking to get ``good research
going in areas where no other research is going.''
   ``We've got to get ideas out of test tubes and into patient
clinical research,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a music teacher's class at Carnegie Mellon
University, students keep an ear to the ground, and it's surprising
what they hear. As they write diaries describing the sounds they
pick up, they reveal a lot about themselves.

   The sighs of students failing a test. The
whoosh of swimmers underwater. The drone of fluorescent lights. The
``thunk'' of a soft drink machine dispensing a can.
   Everyday sounds usually go unnoticed, but a Carnegie Mellon
University music professor is using them to help her students
develop the ear sensitivity crucial to musicians.
   Associate Professor Marilyn Taft Thomas asked the 44 freshmen in
her ``Awareness of Sound'' classes to compile ``sound diaries.''
The students were told to take note of striking sounds and describe
them in a notebook.
   Ms. Thomas was startled at the results. She not only had
collections of sounds, but snapshots of the lives of freshmen.
   ``Have you ever heard people failing a test?'' wrote Melinda
Klump, 18, of Saginaw, Mich. ``It's really amazing...all over the
room are these sighs of exasperation and resignation...It's a very
frustrating sound to hear, even if you think you're making passing
noises.''
   Paul Lu, 19, of Allentown, visited a refinery and reported:
``Very loud. Steam hissing, control signals beeping, dump truck,
windy, messy. Hydraulic pump. Feet on metal stairs. Do I really
want to be a chemical engineer?''
   ``The objective of the assignment was to develop the students'
ability to listen more acutely and more critically to everyday
sounds, as well as to musical performances,'' Ms. Thomas says.
``But it did much more than that. It captured a very important
transition in the lives of a group of young people.''
   Serious students of music develop hearing so sensitive they can
recognize individual notes in recordings of musical pieces, Ms.
Thomas says.
   ``I was trying to find new ways to actually open them to
sound,'' she says. ``The diaries seemed like at least something
that would cause them to focus on what they were listening to.''
   Improved listening skills also can be important in other areas
of life, she says. While teaching a Pittsburgh anti-poverty program
in the 1960s, Ms. Thomas used music to improve ear sensitivity in
preschoolers.
   ``What we had to do first was open their ears,'' she says.
``Kids who lived in very crowded environments had learned to close
out sound to the point that their biggest problems when they
started school was not listening and not knowing how to listen.
   ``They had made a physical adjustment to survive. In a very
crowded, noisy environment, it's the only way you can cope.''
   Ms. Thomas says she knew her experiment was working when her
Carnegie Mellon students became bored with ``the same obvious
sounds every day'' and began to describe more subtle ones in
greater and greater detail.
   After walking through a university building, Miss Klump wrote,
``The Coke machine in Mudge Hall is stubborn _ you put your money
in and it makes this huge self-abusing collage of clanks before it
gives you a Coke. As if it hurts to give one up.''
   After missing sleep for several nights to study, she wrote, ``I
haven't slept for four days. Everything sounds really strange...All
the sounds are like I'm not really here...I'm in a bubble.''
   In another diary, a freshman from rural Massachusetts marveled
at how different the cacophony of city sounds are from peaceful
country sounds. After not hearing from her little brother for a
month, she also rejoiced over the sound of his voice over the
telephone.
   ``Underwater everything is magnified and distorted,'' wrote
Susan Shimel, 19, of Seneca, S.C. ``Movement from other swimmers.
Air exhaled and bubbling to the surface to escape.''
   ``Constant drone of fluorescent lights _ similar to...a huge
insect!'' Miss Shimel wrote.
   ``Silence seemed scarce,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``Kids often
mentioned missing it.''

   Puerto Rican actor Raul Julia, who portrays
Aristotle Onassis in a new ABC miniseries, says he thinks the Greek
shipping magnate got the idea for his first fortune at the movies.
   ``The Richest Man in the World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis''
tells how Onassis made his first millions in tobacco and then
bought six aging tankers that he eventually turned into an empire.
   The four-hour miniseries, which will be telecast on Sunday and
Monday, also chronicles Onassis' tempestuous love affair with opera
star Maria Callas and his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of
President John F. Kennedy.
   Julia takes over the role when Onassis is 35 and is about to
make the transition from tobacco importer to shipping magnate.
Young ``Aristo'' is played by Elias Koteas.
   ``He was a self-made man who left Greece when he was in his
early 20s with $250 and went to Buenos Aires,'' Julia says. ``He
sold ties on the street and worked as a telephone operator. Then he
got the idea, I think from watching a Rudolph Valentino film, of
making cigarettes for women.''
   Onassis began importing Turkish tobacco into Argentina by ship.
   ``When he learned how much money the ship owners were making he
bought six old tankers at a bargain,'' Julia says. ``Then he found
the shipping business was like a closed fraternity. He had to marry
into one of the great Greek shipping families to make a go of it.''
   Onassis' first wife was Tina Livanos (played by Beatie Edney),
daughter of Stavros Livanos (played by Anthony Zerbe). They had two
children before the marriage ended in divorce. Tina remarried twice
before she died.
   Julia says the marriage was an example of Onassis' determination
to win at any cost.
   ``He was a man who would stop at nothing to get what he
wanted,'' he says. ``He was very persuasive, very charming. He knew
how to manipulate people into doing his wishes. He was very
cunning...absolutely ruthless.''
   Jane Seymour also stars as Maria Callas and Francesca Annis
plays Jacqueline Kennedy. Anthony Quinn plays Onassis' father,
Socrates, and Quinn's son, Lorenzo Quinn, portrays Aristotle's only
son, Alexander. Anthony Quinn played a thinly disguised version of
Onassis in a 1978 movie, ``The Greek Tycoon.''
   ``Ari and Maria had a very stormy, passionate affair,'' Julia
says. ``They were both Greek. They loved each other madly and they
fought as madly as they loved. They never married. They were both
married to someone else. I would say it lasted until he died. Even
after he married Jackie he saw her several times.''
   Julia says Onassis also had had another passionate affair with a
Swedish woman, ``but we don't show that in the picture.''
   ``When she was in her 80s, before she died, she told a writer
she still loved Onassis,'' he says.
   Onassis sometimes treated his women cruelly and had no
consideration of their feelings, Julia says. ``Yet they still loved
him to the end.''
   This is Julia's first television role since he played
Mussolini's son-in-law in the 1986 NBC miniseries ``Mussolini: The
Untold Story.''
   Prior to ``Onassis,'' he was in Brazil for ``Moon Over
Parador,'' a Paul Mazursky comedy in which he plays a Latin
American strongman who forces an American actor (Richard Dreyfuss)
to pose as the country's dictator. He doesn't want the people to
know that the dictator has died. It sounds like a comedy version of
``The Prisoner of Zenda,'' but Julia says it's more like Danny
Kaye's ``The Inspector General.''
   Julia has another movie coming out this summer called ``The
Penitents,'' which was written and directed by character actor
Cliff Osmond. It's about a Mexican farmer who helps re-create the
passion of Christ during Lent, which leads to a crucifixion. It
also tells of the farmer's conflict with his wife, who is still a
virgin.
   Julia, a native of Puerto Rico, lives in New York, where he is
closely associated with the theater. He is married and has two sons.
   He is a four-time Tony nominee for ``Nine,'' ``Threepenny
Opera,'' ``Where's Charley?'' and ``Two Gentlemen of Verona.'' His
last Broadway role was in George Bernard Shaw's ``Arms and the
Man.''
   The National Board of Review named him best actor for his role
in the 1985 movie ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''

   In the new Broadway drama ``M. Butterfly,'' B.D.
Wong plays a star of the Beijing Opera, a graceful, charming and
sensuous woman who seduces a French diplomat.
   Before the third act begins, the 25-year-old actor sits on stage
in front of the audience, takes off his makeup and emerges as a
brash, aggressive and embittered man.
   The metamorphosis is one of the most astonishing performances on
Broadway this season.
   What makes it more bizarre is that the story is based on real
life. The diplomat, played in ``M. Butterfly'' by John Lithgow,
believed he was enamored of a real woman. Because of Wong's
performance, many theatergoers believe the same thing.
   For Wong, who is making his Broadway debut in ``M. Butterfly,''
the success of the show has been particularly satisfying.
   After graduating from high school, he moved to New York from
California but never got a break on Broadway. Wong gave up after
two years and took up television and film work in Los Angeles.
   The potential of ``M. Butterfly,'' written by David Henry Hwang,
lured him back to New York last year. Wong got a copy of the script
on a Monday and by the following Thursday he was flying to New York
to audition on money borrowed from his parents.
   ``I didn't even read the whole script before I said, `I have to
go,''' he recalls. After three auditions, he got the part, but
rehearsals were delayed several months until Lithgow completed a
film. The play finally opened in March at the Eugene O'Neill
Theater.
   Wong wasn't deterred by appearing on stage as a woman.
   ``I didn't buy into the stigma of playing a woman because I
don't understand that stigma,'' he says. ``What's the big deal? A
woman is a person. And this woman is a person with incredible depth
and possibilities. Why not accept that as a great challenge?
   ``Plus the third act of the play is written very strongly,'' he
adds. ``The impression you're left with is not a man playing a
woman. You're left with something that bangs against the two
extremes.''
   Before rehearsals started in January, Wong read books on Chinese
theater, China during the Cultural Revolution and female
psychology. Director John Dexter even gave him the French writer
Colette to read.
   ``Everything you read gives insight into what you're doing,''
the actor says.
   ``I feel like I've pretty much eliminated the middle man. I
don't play him playing her. I play her and I play him. That is
because the play is written in the realm of this man's
imagination,'' says Wong, referring to the character Lithgow plays.
``So what he sees is the most womanly, most perfect vision of his
woman.''
   To perfect that vision, the actor also trained with Jamie H.J.
Guan, a former member of the Beijing Opera, who also appears in
``M. Butterfly.''
   ``I got 20 years of Beijing Opera training in two weeks,'' Wong
says. ``There were exercises for my lower back and legs and a lot
of work to get my body in good physical shape.''
   The role was more of a challenge vocally, he says.
   ``I worked with a vocal coach who coached me in a lot of the
dialogue,'' Wong says. ``We experimented with a lot of different
voices, a lot of different approaches to the way she spoke.''
   Wong, whose father recently retired from a post office job, grew
up in San Francisco, the middle son in a Chinese-American family.
   ``I was the one who wanted to be an artist,'' he says. ``I
always wanted to make things. I wasn't interested in math or more
practical things like my older brother who is a doctor in Seattle.''
   Wong seriously discovered theater while in junior high school.
He was in many school extravaganzas of old Broadway musicals as
well as community theater and semi-professional productions.
   ``My dad was always very supportive of my interest in culture,''
he says. ``For my parents to realize that I wanted to be an actor
or an artist was something that was different. But they turned
around and for the last seven years have been so supportive. That's
the most gratifying thing about the work now. You see their pride
in it.''
   After graduating from high school, Wong went to San Francisco
State ``for about 20 minutes,'' before moving to New York and then
to Los Angeles. He trained privately and not in any acting school,
preferring to learn from practical experience on stage.
   California brought him small roles on television series like
``Simon and Simon'' and ``Shell Game,'' as well as the movie ``The
Karate Kid II'' and the West Coast engagement of the musical
``Mail.''
   For now, he's decided to settle down with ``M. Butterfly'' for
what could be a long run.
   ``I am an actor for certain reasons and the reasons are all
fulfilled by this play,'' Wong says. ``You are an actor to play
interesting roles and to move an audience in a certain way. What
more could you possibly ask for than to have a role like this?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The government projects that by the turn of the
century, 1 million American farms will fail. Those that survive
will be those that adapt to a changing market and new technology.
Here's a look at what's going on down on the farm today and what's
likely in store for the future.

   Kurt Alstede of Chester, N.J., grows everything from asparagus
to zucchini on 500 acres of prime farmland that is also prime real
estate. An hour's drive from Manhattan, these fertile fields are
beyond the means of most people.
   Including Kurt Alstede.
   No problem. Because of a state law that greatly reduces taxes on
productive farmland, a number of Morris County property owners are
willing to let Alstede farm their land rent-free. Some even pay him.
   Not owning a farm hasn't hurt him a bit; in fact, the state
Department of Agriculture recently named the 24-year-old
first-generation farmer ``Outstanding Young Farmer of the Year.''
   ``There's still strong, viable agriculture in New Jersey, but
it's a different sort of agriculture,'' says Alstede, a different
sort of farmer.
   In Fresno County, Calif., 3,000 miles from Alstede's retail farm
market, Pete DeGroot, along with his father and brother, owns a
dairy that's roughly 20 times the size of the typical American
dairy farm.
   Milking 1,900 cows enables the DeGroots to take advantage of
economies of scale, a crucial edge in an industry where, as Fresno
County Agent Craig Thomas puts it, ``You either get bigger or you
get out.''
   Pete DeGroot, 38, is a different sort of farmer, too.
   He neither milks cows nor drives tractors; traditional farm
chores are performed by his 20 full-time employees. DeGroot, who
has a degree in economics and business, spends his time doing
paperwork or meeting with lawyers or accountants. ``In a coat and
tie,'' he says, ``not in overalls.''
   On their opposite coasts, with their vastly different styles,
Pete DeGroot and Kurt Alstede actually have much in common. They
embody a growing trend in agriculture: farmers who, like other
endangered species, survive _ even thrive _by adapting their
methods to suit their surroundings.
   They do it through a variety of methods, including astute market
research and creative risk-taking, diversification and direct
marketing.
   DeGroot's large milkshed and Alstede's small, diverse crop farm
also point the way to the two opposite poles in which farms may be
headed.
   Over the next 20 years, agriculture experts predict, farming
will move one step forward and one step back. Forward, because
dwindling profit margins for dairy, poultry, beef and hog farmers
will force big, specialized operations to grow bigger and more
specialized still. Back, because for small operations like
Alstede's, diversity and direct marketing will be critical.
   ``The trend toward more and more smaller farmers and
`mega-farms' will continue,'' says Mike Brown, director of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's South-Central Family Farm Research
Center in Boonville, Ark.
   The USDA projects that by the turn of the century, 1 million
American farms will fail. Most will be midsized operations that are
neither large enough to make up for falling profit margins with
economies of scale, nor small enough to respond quickly to
fluctuating commodity prices.
   For small farmers who hope to survive into the next century,
Brown says, the wave of the future may well be a page from the past.
   ``Our grandparents were diversified,'' he says. ``The farmer
sold milk and wheat, and his wife sold eggs in town. Nobody worried
about making a killing. Over the years, they concentrated on
keeping fluid.
   ``As we look to the future, we will re-adopt that philosophy of
diversification. There'll be smaller profits per enterprise, but
with more winners than losers.''
   Brown predicts there will be more people farming ``on the
side,'' turning some of their attention to profitable enterprises
that help support the high cost of farming.
   Such is the case of Richard Kind, a Slippery Rock, Pa., dairy
farmer who three years ago transformed a chunk of his 500-acre farm
into a coal mine.
   ``Western Pennsylvania has lots of low-sulfur coal close to the
surface,'' says Kind. ``Strip miners have been interested in the
land for 30 years or longer, but we never wanted to strip. We were
always afraid they wouldn't put it back right.''
   In 1970, Kind sold his small dairy and pieced together his
current place from the remains of a half-dozen former cattle farms.
With two sons about to join him in business, he needed to expand.
   The new place needed work: A modern dairy barn and silos had to
be built and a new well needed to be dug. Kind took out a $250,000
mortgage. ``At the time, interest rates were 6 percent,'' he says.
``They went up to 16. We paid it down very slowly, and paid heavy
interest.''
   He began talking to other property owners who'd had their land
stripped and he studied their reclaimed property. The turning point
came when the McKnight Coal Co. offered Kind use of land on another
farm during mining.
   In 1985, Kind agreed to allow the coal company to strip 125
acres.
   ``At $3 a ton, an acre-inch of coal will run 125 to 140 tons,''
Kind says. ``Our coal ran near the crop line. It ranged from 8
inches to 22 inches thick, and averaged 16 to 17 inches wide.''

   With mining just eight months away from completion, Kind says
he's pleased with the quality of his reclaimed land. Best of all,
he says, ``the coal paid off the mortgage. We'll have a debt-free
farm when we finish.''
   As more farmland is lost to development, many farmers are
finding themselves devoting more time and effort to educating new,
suburban neighbors.
   ``More and more, we have people from urban areas moving to rural
areas, people who move right next door to you, then discover they
don't like the smell of cow manure,'' Alstede says.
   Lack of respect for private farm property is a recurring
problem. ``Lots of people help themselves to a picnic in your
cornfield, or they'll go four-wheeling, or throw Burger King
wrappers out their car windows,'' he says. ``We spend more time
along our roads picking up other people's trash.''
   If farmers and suburbanites are going to co-exist, ``we have to
promote our industry and educate people about what it takes to stay
profitable. If you want to preserve farmland and agriculture, you
have to preserve the atmosphere that allows it to be profitable. If
I can't make a living here, I can't stay.''
   Aesthetics are very important to Alstede, who sells his
strawberries, tomatoes and pumpkins at a hilltop farm stand
overlooking the fields in which they were grown.
   ``They sell vegetables at ShopRite, and mine aren't always
cheaper,'' he says. ``It's the farm atmosphere that brings people
to me.''
   There's little regard for aesthetics on the DeGroot farm. There
are no little red barns. No silos. No quaint clapboard house. ``The
larger, better-run dairies out here look very practical, with open
dirt corrals instead of barns, metal pipe fences and outdoor feed
bunks,'' says county agent Thomas.
   Doubling up _ two or more families on a single, large farm _ was
the survival strategy the DeGroots chose when, 15 years ago, they
sold a 400-cow dairy near Los Angeles and moved to Fresno, where
lower property values meant more room to grow.
   ``If all three of us were on smaller farms, we'd all have to do
more physical labor,'' Pete DeGroot says. ``On a larger farm, you
make less per cow and your labor costs are higher, but it also will
add up a bit more.''
   Increasingly, bigger numbers are crucial to keeping livestock
farms profitable. ``Every time there's a price cut, it brings down
the profit per animal. You have to keep adding. Beef, swine or
sheep _ they've all gotten bigger,'' says Thomas.
   Bigger farms, especially those in areas with cold winters and
hot summers, also will mean more animals being raised on concrete,
says Norman Steele, animal researcher at the USDA's Beltsville,
Md., Agricultural Research Center. ``Land values are up, and time
is money _ thus, confinement,'' Steele says.
   At Beltsville and elsewhere, researchers are developing vaccines
to control the viral diseases more often seen in animals raised
indoors. They're also harder to control than the parasitic diseases
more common in animals raised on pastureland.
   Among the benefits to confinement are the ability it gives
farmers to control each animal's diet, the key to increased
production and higher profits.
   ``Today's cow already spends more time indoors than 25 years
ago,'' says Robert Graves, a professor of agricultural engineering
at Penn State University. ``We try to feed them the same every day,
and that doesn't fit well with pasture.
   ``Sending a cow off to pasture is like sending a kid off to buy
his own lunch. Chances are he'll buy all candy and forget about the
carrots.''
   And land that can grow good pasture can probably be better used
to grow valuable storage crops, he says.
   Poultry farms, like cattle and dairy farms, will continue to
grow. The big news in poultry: the debut of the turkey ``stud
farm,'' the legacy of USDA poultry scientist Thomas Sexton's
pioneering work to improve the shelf life of turkey semen. As a
result, fewer toms are needed for breeding, making turkey meat
cheaper and more plentiful.
   More varied, exotic produce and protein, such as catfish, shrimp
and game birds, will be another growing trend in a climate in which
``people will look at the markets before they look at the
products,'' says Brown, the Family Farm Center's director.
   Industrial materials such as guayule, a shrub used to make
rubber, and kenaf, a fast-growing plant used in the manufacture of
newsprint, could be among the crops of the future, according to the
USDA, whose Cooperative State Research Service already has
demonstration projects under way.
   Another promising research project, on Maryland's Eastern Shore,
will eventually be expanded to a 30-acre underwater farm that will
produce 60,000 tons of hybrid striped bass.
   Current research is designed to save farmers as well as farms,
according to Graves, who says tomorrow's barns will feature
mechanical gutter-cleaners and ``monorail carts that run around in
front of the cows and dispense feed every four hours.''
   ``Animals that are fed regularly can be more productive, but you
can get pretty tired of getting up every night to feed them. These
things aren't Flash Gordon _ they're possible, and they're already
being done,'' Graves says.
   ``Farmers have TV sets too, and they see how people who work 35
hours a week live. We can't promise them 40-hour weeks, but we can
direct our efforts to help see to it the farmer of tomorrow has a
better quality of life.''

   A new breed of leaner, faster-growing
``designer'' livestock may soon take up residence in America's more
fashionable barnyards.
   The sheep, pigs and cattle of tomorrow will be given daily
supplements of growth-regulating hormones, synthetic versions of
proteins that naturally occur in animals.
   Experiments at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Beltsville
Research Center and elsewhere have shown that daily doses of the
synthetic hormones add up to greater yields of milk and meat.
   While they have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for commercial use, growth hormones have reduced
fat, increased yields of lean meat and improved feed efficiency in
the laboratory.
   Administered to mature dairy cows, growth hormones can increase
milk production by 20 percent, according to animal researcher
Norman Steele.
   On growing animals, the effects are more dramatic. ``When
supplemented by increased dietary protein, we can create longer,
bigger, leaner animals,'' Steele says.
   In one recent experiment involving two 66-pound hogs, the animal
treated with growth hormones reached a goal weight of 130 pounds
two weeks faster than his untreated brother. At the end of the
40-day experiment, the treated pig was 42 percent bigger.
   He also was leaner. ``It takes fewer calories to make a pound of
lean meat than it does to make a pound of fat,'' Steele says. ``The
untreated hog required 2.6 pounds of feed per one pound of body
weight gain. The treated hog required 1.96 pounds of feed to gain a
pound. To a farmer, that means a 30 percent increase in profits.''
   The news appears to be good for consumers, as well. ``It's a
natural product _ in people, it's digested. And we'll produce more
meat with less feed, which could bring prices down,'' says Douglas
Bolt, a USDA research physiologist.
   Genetic engineering has enabled researchers to produce synthetic
growth hormones at low prices. So far, daily injections are the
only known way of administering growth hormones, although the race
is on among drug companies to develop a slow-release delivery
system.
   Steele and other scientists are now researching the dietary
requirements of the ``new'' pig, the latest in a series of
streamlined models.
   The effort to reduce fat and increase lean meat in hogs dates
back to the emergence of vegetable oils, which began replacing
animals fats in Americans' diets in the '50s.
   In addition to health considerations, ``we realized that fat is
a very inefficient way of using expensive feed,'' Steele says. ``We
now want that feed used to make meat.''
   Efforts to rebuild the hog are among modern agricultural
science's greatest triumphs, resulting in larger quantities of meat
from animals whose longer, leaner bodies now yield a bonus: two
additional pork chops and two extra ribs, the result of an added
vertebra.
   Commercial use of growth hormone in hogs could make the process
complete, making pork competitive with poultry, both in price and
nutrition, says Steele.
   ``However, there comes a point where you can't reduce fat
anymore,'' he acknowledges. ``Bacon doesn't fry up and it's not
very flavorful. It's also much harder to slice.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a pawnbrokerage like no other, where the
word ``hock'' is a dirty word and all the profits go to charity.
For almost a century, the Provident Loan Society of New York has
been a poor man's bank, as its founders intended, but it's also
helped some rich and famous people out of a jam.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the depression year of 1892, four decades
after Karl Marx urged the workers of the world to unite in
revolution, Alfred Bishop Mason urged the millionaires of New York
to unite in pawnbroking.
   ``I would have a pawnshop which would be the poor man's bank,''
he wrote his fellow philanthropists, ``where it shall not be shame
and ruin to borrow, and where loss of self-respect shall not make a
part of every pledge.''
   Although pawnbroking was probably a vocation not previously
contemplated by the likes of J.P. Morgan and Gustav Schwab, seven
tycoons each put up $35,000 to create the nation's only non-profit
pawnbrokerage.
   Today, the Provident Loan Society of New York still has a Morgan
and a Schwab on its board. As always, the borrower is treated with
respect, items are ``pledged'' never ``pawned,'' and ``hock'' is a
dirty word.
   The Provident still charges interest rates far lower than
commercial pawnshops (23 percent annually compared to 36 percent)
and is as reputable and dependable as a bank.
   But, given its traditional aversion to publicity and its refusal
to encourage borrowing, the Provident remains a well-kept secret.
   Maybe too well. For the past two years the Provident has run a
deficit and had to forgo its traditional year-end contribution of
profits to charity.
   ``We've got to let more people know we're here,'' says Samuel F.
Pryor III, chairman of the board.
   That never used to be a problem. The Provident's sterling
reputation attracted pledgors like these:
   _Theodore Dreiser, evicted from his $1.50-a-week room for
non-payment at the turn of the century, pawned his watch for $25,
enough for shoes, a hat and a hotel room. He went on to get a job
and write ``Sister Carrie'' and ``An American Tragedy.''
   _A drunken Frank Fay staggered in to offer a pair of
star-sapphire cuff links. The actor needed money to check into a
clinic and sober up to try out for a part in a play that was to
open on Broadway. He got the loan, entered the clinic and won the
role in the play _ ``Harvey,'' the story of a drunk who sees an
otherwise invisible 6-foot rabbit.
   _Newspaper heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean, who pawned her Star of
the East diamond in 1932 to raise $50,000 in an unsuccessful
attempt to ransom the kidnapped child of aviator Charles Lindbergh.
She originally put up the Hope diamond, but the ultraconservative
Provident assessors decided the Star was a safer bet if Mrs. McLean
defaulted and the stone had to be auctioned.
   The Provident also was the place where tennis star Bill Tilden
pawned bagfuls of silver championship trophies and King Farouk's
queen put up her diamond tiara and matching necklace for $70,000.
Legend has it that Olympian Jim Thorpe pledged two of his Olympic
gold medals there.
   But the Provident's primary clientele has never been the rich or
the celebrated.
   In 1892, with destitution stalking many of the city's 2.5
million people, Mason had envisioned a place where ``the poor
man...could go when he has been robbed of his tools, when he has
been smitten with sickness, or when he saw before him a chance of
rising from man to master by borrowing a little capital to start a
little shop.''
   Or buy a little food. In the era before welfare, cash machines
and credit cards, many people needed credit for necessities. But
money panics periodically denied loans to the poor at all but
ruinous rates.
   Two years after Mason's appeal the Provident was created by
special act of the state Legislature. Morgan, Schwab, Cornelius
Vanderbilt and other incorporators advanced the operating capital
with no assurance they would get it back.
   That, as it turned out, was never in doubt, because the
Provident was an immediate success. All its operating capital had
been loaned out four months after it opened, and by the turn of the
century it was loaning 100,000 pledgors a total of $2 million
annually.
   The Provident hit its peak in 1930, lending $44 million. By the
end of the Depression, 22 Provident offices were together making
about 750,000 new loans a year, one for every 10 New Yorkers and
more than all the city's licensed commercial pawnbrokers put
together.
   This was not surprising, for the Provident was as reputable and
discreet as most pawnbrokers were sleazy and callous.
   When looking for a site for a branch office, the Provident tried
to find locations slightly off the beaten track to preserve
borrowers' privacy. On the outside, they looked like small
classical temples. Inside, they looked and felt like banks, with
chairs, plants, pictures on the wall _ all designed to instill
confidence in the borrower who was leaving behind his Strad or her
engagement ring.

   Eleven of the original 15 trustees died in office, and today
some of their descendants sit in the leather chairs they once
occupied in the dark, paneled board room in the society's stately
headquarters at 24th Street and Park Avenue South.
   The society consists of 50 members, who as a group do little
more than choose 12 trustees. The trustees, in turn, decide who
will be admitted as a member.
   Robert Mulreany, the Provident's president, says most of the
members are ``people who know somebody who knows somebody''
socially or professionally. About half of the members are on the
Social Register, a disproportionate number have gone to Yale, and a
few have names like August Belmont, Thomas E. Dewey Jr. and
Donaldson Pillsbury.
   Occasionally there are other connections. One trustee, a
successful financier, had an ancestor who got through a tight spot
with the aid of a Provident loan.
   Although the Provident is down to seven offices, its role is
more vital than ever. Since 1960, about 90 percent of the city's
commercial pawnbrokers have gone out of business, mostly because of
inflation and volatile interest rates, leaving only 15 survivors.
   The Park Avenue pawnbroker remains the ``poor man's bank'' Mason
envisioned, even though greater profit could be found in larger
loans. About two-thirds of loans are $200 or less; the typical
pledgor is a middle or lower-middle class wage earner, often an
immigrant.
   Some of the best customers are gypsies. The king of one clan
regularly pledges a 10-pound belt made of gold coins soldered
together, redeeming it for ceremonial occasions.
   But the Provident will loan up to $15,000, and it gets some
upscale clients. When the stock market plunged on Oct. 19, 1987,
several harried investors appeared at the Provident's Park Avenue
office, mumbling about margin calls and offering gold or diamond
jewelry for cash.
   Although the Provident once accepted almost anything that could
be stored and resold _ furs, LPs, shotguns, sewing machines _ today
it mostly confines itself to items made of or containing gold,
silver, diamonds or precious stones, plus U.S. stamps and coins.
Mail business outside New York is discouraged.
   When presented with an item, a Provident teller inspects it and
offers a price. Because the Provident can lose money if the item is
not redeemed and must be auctioned, the offer is very conservative
_ usually only 20 percent of retail value.
   If that's not enough, the teller hands the item back with a
smile. If the customer accepts, he receives a loan ticket _ written
out by hand, because the Provident still is not computerized _ and
given a year to pay off the loan with interest and reclaim the
object.
   Unofficially, the Provident is a sucker for a sob story. In
emergencies, branches may hand over a few dollars for an item such
as a radio, along with a recommendation that it be reclaimed as
soon as possible.
   If a loan is not repaid after a year, the Provident is entitled
to auction the item, but it tries to avoid doing so. There are at
least two written notices, followed by attempts to reach the
pledgor by telephone up to the date of the auction. Auctions have
been halted with items on the block by last-minute calls from
pledgors.
   And if there is a compelling reason why the money is not
available _ a lost job or prolonged illness _ the Provident may
hold onto an item for a few more months before auctioning it off.
Only about 5 percent of items pledged at the Provident are finally
sold.
   The pledgor is entitled to any auction profit exceeding the
Provident's principal and interest. If the pledgor can't be
located, the money is held by the state in perpetual escrow. The
Provident's own year-end surpluses, which have totaled more than $4
million since 1892, have gone to charities such as hospitals and
child welfare agencies.
   Some items have been at the Provident for years, with the
original pledgors or their descendants paying the annual interest
charge.
   For years, a successful but superstitious businessman annually
renewed the pledge of an overcoat he'd pawned in his youth,
associating the original loan with the beginning of his rise.
   Since the 1930s, the main office has been holding two violins
whose owners now pay an annual fee of 23 cents to keep them stored.
   But the Provident's greatest legacy is its tradition of service.
An example:
   Confronted with a request for a loan on a piccolo, an appraiser
in a Provident branch telephoned a music store. But the clerk there
said he could not estimate the instrument's value unless he knew
how it sounded.
   Holding up the phone, the appraiser asked the would-be pledgor _
an unemployed musician _ ``Can you convince my friend that your
piccolo is in working order?''
   The musician made the most of his chance, playing the entire
``William Tell Overture.'' When he was finished, everyone _
tellers, customers, the clerk on the other end of the line _ burst
into applause. And he got his loan.

what they like and don't like. Some of the data are useful. But
does anyone really care that the most popular names for newborn
Nebraskans are Katie and John?

   Whether dieting or eating ice cream, skipping school or
studying, getting married or getting divorced, Americans every day
unwittingly become statistics.
   It isn't done consciously, of course, but between government and
private bureaucracies, the bean counters have compiled significant
collections of numbers about life in America _ what's typical and
what isn't.
   In fact, almost every American, from Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon
to tiny Alice Feagin Jones of Frankfort, Ky., is part of the
statistics of daily life in the United States.
   Each day, America's 244,427,098 people (as of Jan. 1) work and
play, love and hate and contribute to the endless collection of
data about themselves.
   The good and the bad, the fun and the tragic, this information
eventually supplies a compilation of bits and pieces of the things
Americans do to and for each other.
   Folks facing the battle of the bulge may take some solace in the
estimate that, on any given day, 63,092,400 adults are trying to
lose weight.
   Of those, the statisticians say, 51,735,768 try to do it by
dieting, while 37,855,660 are exercising to trim off pounds. Many,
of course, are doing both.
   On the other hand, Americans consume an average of three-fourths
of an ounce of ice cream every day of the year.
   Doesn't sound like much, does it? Well, that comes to 18 yummy
pounds of the frozen confection annually.
   Americans eat even more cheese than ice cream, downing nearly a
full ounce daily, or over 22 pounds per year.
   Chef John Kramer used a bit more than the average at West Allis,
Wis., last Aug. 6, however, when he won the Wisconsin State Fair's
cheese carving contest.
   Kramer topped four other competitors by reducing a 75-pound
block to a yellow food collage of Wisconsin images, including a
milk can, milk bottle, ``Real'' seal and bite-size samples of his
work.
   The average daily American diet, the Department of Agriculture
reports, also includes 3.5 ounces of beef, 2.7 ounces of pork, 0.6
ounce of fish, 3 ounces of poultry, 9.4 ounces of milk.
   Add to that, 5.4 ounces of breads, a half-ounce of pasta, about
the same for breakfast cereals, 2.8 ounces of sugar, plus 3.8
ounces of corn sweetener, a little more than one cup of coffee;
15.9 ounces of soft drinks, 2.5 ounces of juice, 8.2 ounces of
beer, 0.8 ounce of wine and 0.6 ounce of liquor.
   It's unlikely that any individual consumes those exact
quantities on any particular day, of course, but a good chunk of
food was consumed by elderly South Dakotans last July 30.
   More than 125 braved 100-degree heat that day for a potluck
dinner at the Pierre Senior Center.
   Usually, when senior citizens are mentioned, popular retirement
areas like Florida and Arizona come to mind, but seniors are in
every state and community in growing numbers.
   Indeed, the Census Bureau reports that nearly 6,000 Americans
turn 65 every day.
   And, adds the National Center for Health Statistics, on a
typical day 3,212,857 elderly parents receive a phone call from one
of their children.
   Did you just buy a new home? You're not alone.
   On an average day in America, 107,887 people move to a new home.
   And that's not all.
   The federal government hires 216 new workers, and 236 are hired
by state governments; 37,514,400 adults get less than 7 hours
sleep, 56,061 drive a car after drinking alcohol, 337 children are
injured while playing with toys, 1,594 people are hurt in bicycle
accidents and 108 men cut themselves seriously while shaving.
   Among the younger set, on a normal day 36,582,990 children
attend public school, while 2,951,836 children who should be in
school, aren't.
   For Oklahoma youngsters, the statistics on those playing
football may change a bit under a suggestion by Gov. Bellmon. He
has proposed a rule that students who fail their studies be barred
from extracurricular activities such as sports.
   Also in a typical day, 6,548 American couples are wed, according
to federal statistics. In addition, 288 couples decide to live
together without bothering to marry, and 3,230 couples are divorced.
   While joy and hope for the future marks the thousands of
weddings cataloged daily, tragedy was the focus of the
Russellville, Ark., entry into the federal data bank.
   Sixteen people were slain in December in and near that small
community in one of the nation's worst mass murders.
Forty-seven-year-old R. Gene Simmons has been charged in the case,
an extreme example of the more than 50 murders that occur daily in
this country, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics.

   In a nation with more than 244 million people, crime is a
continual concern, statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation show.
   No particular day is, of course, typical, nor is any individual
crime. But on average, the statistics say a day in America includes
239 rapes, 1,364 robberies, 1,980 assaults, 8,419 burglaries,
18,975 thefts, and 3,021 motor vehicle thefts.
   All the news and numbers can't be bad.
   Take for example Rhododendron, Ore., where the U.S. Forest
Service last summer began cutting logs for breakwaters and digging
out ponds along Still Creek to create quiet areas for salmon and
steelhead to breed.
   More and better spawning grounds mean more fish, and in the long
run more game for fishermen, a boon for the 99,000 Americans who
buy fishing licenses in an average day, according to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.
   An estimated 78,000 Americans buy hunting licenses every day _
although most are sold during hunting season.
   In addition, 721,643 people visit national parks and landmarks
daily, while the folks less inclined to outdoor activity buy some
5,643,000 books, 789,000 records and 940,000 tapes on an average
day.
   And potential future outdoors enthusiasts, readers and musicians
continue to arrive. For example, little Alice Feagin Jones, who
debuted at 8 pounds on Jan. 1, the first baby of 1988 in Frankfort,
Ky.; offspring of Wesley and Alice Jones.
   Katie and John, meanwhile, probably were among the first new
Nebraskans arriving.
   In Lincoln, Neb., the state health department took a look at the
names most popular with new arrivals there in 1986. The winners:
Katie for girls and John for boys.
   The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 10,279
babies are born on an average day in the United States. There is,
however, no longer such a thing as a typical day.
   The increasing use of Caesarean delivery has resulted in more
babies arriving on weekdays, and a sharp decline in births on
weekends and holidays.
   No word yet on how this will affect the future of astrology.
   Of the more than 10,000 babies born daily, 1,994 are children of
unwed mothers.
   The other side of birth is death, and on a typical day more than
5,700 people die in this country.
   Some are famous, some infamous, most known mainly to friends and
family for lives in which they have done their best and who feel
the loss in ways no impersonal statistic can ever measure.
   Daily deaths, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics, include 1,254 from cancer and 2,686 from heart disease,
the most common killers. Also on a normal day, 123 people die in
motor vehicle accidents on America's highways.
   Fires join accidents among the most common threats to Americans.
   A Toledo, Ohio, family of eight was left homeless on Aug. 8 when
a child playing with matches started a blaze that caused extensive
damage to their apartment.
   The fire was one of an estimated 1,704 house fires in the nation
if that was an average day, according to the federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
   Happily there were no injuries in the Toledo fire, although
blazes claim 14 American lives daily, according to the Commission
and the National Center for Health Statistics.
   While the elderly population is growing rapidly, so are those in
middle age, children of the post-World War II Baby Boom, meaning
that more than 10,000 Americans turn 40 daily.
   But those folks haven't been replacing themselves, resulting in
smaller populations of young people. Only about 8,800 people become
teen-agers each day.
   Despite the relatively smaller size of the young population,
children's diseases continue to threaten youngsters. For example,
Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Joan K. Leavitt reports a dramatic
increase in the number of cases of whooping cough in her state.
   Oklahoma recorded 75 cases of the disease in the first half of
1987, up from 56 in the same period a year earlier. Most cases have
been in small children.
   Nationally, six cases of whooping cough are recorded per day,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Incidents of
the disease have risen in recent years as some parents have delayed
having their children immunized.
   While not all diseases have to be reported to federal officials,
the Center estimates that on an average day Americans are infected
with 6,082 cases of chicken pox, 2,298 cases of gonorrhea, 192
cases of syphilis, 22 cases of AIDS, eight cases of mumps, seven
cases of measles and two cases of Legionnaires' disease.
   Many of those folks join the 2,753,425 people who see a doctor
every day. An additional 1,041,095 people visit their dentist.
   How do they get there? Most drive, leading to the estimate that
more than 30,250 automobiles are sold in the United States in a
normal day. And while many are replacing others that are wrecked,
the total in use continues to grow.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A hearty laugh is good therapy in a lot of ways,
says a New York educator who for the past 10 years has been
spreading the gospel of humor. He's Joel Goodman, director of the
Humor Project at Saratoga, whose motto is, ``Jest for the health of
it.''
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a storm sent a tree crashing
onto a motorists' car in Minneapolis a few years back, the owner
grabbed a pen and scribbled a few words on a piece of cardboard.
   Standing next to his car, he cheered passing motors with his
sign reading: ``Compact Car.''
   Now that's the way to deal with a disaster, says
humorist-educator Joel Goodman, who tells the story often.
   Goodman should know. He makes a living out of telling people
humor is no laughing matter _ that you'll live longer if you loosen
up, laugh and enjoy life.
   ``People who laugh...last,'' quips the pint-sized, 38-year-old
Goodman.
   ``Jest for the health.''
   Goodman, who speaks with a lot of one-liners, is director of the
Humor Project at Saratoga, a non-profit resource and training
center in Saratoga Springs. He says his mission is to get people to
use humor as a tool for handling stress and as a way to get along
better with others.
   Don't laugh, it works.
   So far, he has written seven books on humor and has spoken to
more than 80,000 people in the past 10 years throughout the United
States, Canada and Europe in lectures and workshops.
   He's helped businesses and hospitals integrate humor into their
daily routine. He's also received a grant from a Florida hospital
corporation to study the medical implications and applications of
humor.
   Goodman, who has a doctorate in education, also teaches graduate
and undergraduate courses on health education at Russell Sage
College in Troy.
   Goodman says humor is important not only because of its health
value, but because of its benefits in the workplace. He believes
humor on the job boosts enthusiasm and psychic energy, which he
says are steppingstones to greater creativity, alertness and
camaraderie.
   ``Many people who are fired from their jobs get the boot not
because they lack technical skills, but because they are unable to
get along with others,'' he says.
   Goodman, an irrepressible pun-lover, started his work in humor
education about 10 years ago with the opening of the Humor
Institute.
   He said he first became interested in humor when he was in
Houston, where his father underwent cardiovascular surgery in the
early 1970s. He said the driver of the shuttle bus from the hotel
to the medical center joked with passengers, helping the relatives
of critically ill patients cope with their anxieties and fears.
   ``I got to thinking about how humor can help people in many
walks of life by ridding them of anxiety or helping them see the
funny side of some real-life situations,'' he said during a recent
inverview in his office, a clutter of cartoons, posters, gags and
joke books in a red brick church he converted to office space.
   Goodman also speaks to professionals from corporations such as
IBM and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., medical groups and educators
about how humor can improve productivity, improve teaching efforts
and help patients get well.
   He said when he first thought of trying to integrate humor in
the workplace, he didn't think the corporate market would be
interested in such a project.
   He was wrong. Since directing his energies to comic relief, he's
developed programs for major corporations that look at how managers
and executives can use humor to build morale.
   He's also helped a number of hospitals set up humor rooms for
patients, equipped with games, records, books and movies. The Humor
Project has received a grant from the Humana Hospital Corp. in
Orlando, Fla., to focus on the medical implications and
applications of humor.
   Sunnyview Rehabilitation Center in Schenectady recently hired
Goodman to conduct a staff seminar.
   ``The first thing we did was to put up a humor bulletin board in
the cafeteria,'' says Anita Friar, director of social work at
Sunnyview. ``We asked people to contribute their favorite
one-liners or cartoons.''
   Friar says the hospital also has collections of humorous
readings and audio and visual tapes that the staff distributes to
patients.
   ``I don't know if you can document it scientifically,'' she
says, ``but sometimes focusing on a disability decreases a
patient's energy. Humor increases the positive energy, and when
they use that energy they get better.''
   Scientific research supports the theory that laughter is
important for good health. Laughter releases endorphins, which are
natural pain killers. A good, hearty laugh exercises internal
organs like the diaphragm, thorax, abdomen, heart and lungs,
providing a miniworkout.
   Goodman believes that if people would only laugh 15 times a day,
there would be fewer doctor bills.
   ``Future doctors, instead of saying, `Take two asprin and call
me in the morning,' will say, `Watch a Lily Tomlin special and call
me in the morning.'''
   Humor can go a long way in romantic relationships as well.
Studies show that a sense of humor usually rates No. 1 or No. 2 of
qualities men and women look for in a romantic partner, Goodman
says.
   Goodman also puts out a magazine, ``Laughing Matters,'' which
takes a light and serious look at the power of humor in everyday
life.
   Goodman's lecture topics include such things as ``Filler Phrases
for Thesis Writers'' and ``Career Opportunities in Iran'' are among
the most popular lecture topics.
   Goodman says many adults aren't comfortable with humor.
   ``Humor involves letting go,'' he says. ``That's why adults shy
away from it, because they think it means they're out of control.''
   ``Actually that's true, because when people laugh they lose
control _ of their muscles.''
   ``But humor is power. You can't often control situations around
you, but you can control your internal responses to them with
humor. That's power.''
   Goodman says he believes America is enjoying a resurgence of
humor, citing a growing number of comedy clubs and the popularity
of television shows like Bill Cosby's as proof.
   And there isn't anyone who doesn't have a sense of humor:
   ``It's just that some have had years of neglect.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``A Time of Destiny''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes a mere title can afford a negative tip-off to the
nature of a movie _ like the new Columbia Pictures release, ``A
Time of Destiny.'' What does ``A Time of Destiny'' portend? Events
leading up to the Crucifixion? Napoleon's climactic years? The last
days of John F. Kennedy?
   Then you learn that the movie concerns a blood feud in a
Basque-American family set against a World War II background. And
it becomes glaringly apparent that both the title and the film ring
false.
   The co-starring of William Hurt and Timothy Hutton indicates the
pretensions of ``A Time for Destiny.'' But Hurt has never been seen
at such a disadvantage, and Hutton's earnest efforts cannot rescue
the sodden script from sinking into a bog, just like one of the
major characters.
   The plot is almost impossible to synopsize, since it is related
in confusing flashbacks _ sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks.
The scene is San Diego in wartime. A tightly knit Basque family is
ruled imperiously by the father, Francisco Rabal. When his favorite
daughter, Melissa Leo, elopes with a GI, Timothy Hutton, the father
pursues and snatches her from the bridal chamber. Hutton pursues
them in the stormy night, and the father is drowned when his car
falls into a lake.
   The outcast son, William Hurt, turns up for the funeral. He
blames Hutton for the father's death and vows vengeance. The
husband-and-wife screenwriters, Anna Thomas and Gregory Nava (she
also produced and he directed) would have us believe that Hurt was
able to enlist and be assigned to Hutton's very same army unit,
following him into combat in Italy.
   That's only part of the film's unbelievability. Hurt tries to
kill Hutton in combat, then they seem to become buddies. But at
war's end, Hurt remembers his vow, and the final, unconvincing
battle comes at the California mission where Hutton married the
family's daughter.
   The leaden melodrama never achieves conviction, and little is
offered to explain Hurt's dementia, except for flashbacks of the
father locking his son in a barn. It's painful to witness an actor
of Hurt's stature floundering in an impossible role. It's also
distressful to see Thomas and Nava stumble after their admirable
``El Norte.''
   ``A Time of Destiny'' is rated PG-13, probably for language.
Running time: 115 minutes.

   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes quit
as chief spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co. after creating an uproar
by admitting he had concocted quotes for President Reagan.
   Speakes said in a statement Friday that his resignation was
``the best course of action for Merrill Lynch and for me
personally. Merrill Lynch is a great firm and the industry leader,
and I've enjoyed being part of it.''
   The announcement reflected intense pressure on Speakes to resign
as head of communications at the Wall Street investment giant
because of his disclosures in a book about his tenure as White
House spokesman. He said in the book that he had attributed to
Reagan comments the president never said.

   The nation got its first big dose of inflation
this year as wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent
in March, the government said.
   The Labor Department's producer price index rose 0.6 percent
last month, marking the biggest increase since April 1987 and more
than erasing a 0.2 percent decline in February, according to the
report released Friday.
   Falling energy and food prices that had been keeping a lid on
inflationary pressures shot upwards in March.

assurance to nervous financial markets and further efforts to
rescue the U.S. dollar.
   The semi-annual meeting of the 151-nation IMF, which ended

   In an effort to brake the nosedive, the United States and its

   Other major U.S. airlines, facing potential revenue losses from
their frequent-flier programs, could well follow Friday's

   James E. Olson, the forceful chairman of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. who got his start cleaning silt
out of manholes, died early today of cancer, the company announced.
   Olson, who had led the telecommunications giant since the fall
of 1986, had been operated on late last month for a tumor in the
colon.
   He was 62. The company said he died at home.
   AT&T President Robert E. Allen, who took over from Olson after
he became ill last month, will continue to direct the company until
the board of directors elects a new chairman, company spokeswoman
Lynda Beighley said.
   AT&T's directors will meet around the time of the annual meeting
Wednesday in Denver, but Ms. Beighley said she could not say if a
chairman would be picked at that time.
   Olson became ill with flu on March 18 and had surgery seven days
later. He returned home April 1 and had been undergoing
chemotherapy as an outpatient since that time.
   ``All of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of
Jim's death,'' Allen said in a statement. ``He was a dynamic and
visionary leader. We will miss him. Our legacy to him will be the
vigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out for
us during his 20 months as our leader.''
   Allen, 52, is the company's president and chief operating
officer.
   Olson had made AT&T more aggressive, more cost-conscious and
more certain of its direction since taking office in September 1986.
   Analysts said the company had drifted in the first years after
the historic breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1, 1984, when local
phone service was split into seven regional Bell holding companies.
   Olson, who landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17,
was considered a take-charge executive with an emphasis on getting
results. Disdaining the fashion of corporate boardrooms, the beefy
executive wore short-sleeved shirts throughout his career.
   ``Jim Olson was the ultimate tough guy. ... I think he instilled
a real sense of pride and determination in an AT&T workforce that
at that time needed it,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   ``I think he leaves AT&T in good hands,'' Grubman said. ``If
this had happened a year ago, it would have been extremely
disruptive.''
   Allen is widely considered to be AT&T's almost certain choice as
a successor to Olson. ``He is a big-picture guy,'' Grubman said.
``His style is probably more overtly executive (than Olson's),'' he
said.
   Olson, a native of Devils Lake, N.D., was born Dec. 3, 1925. His
first job, in which he cleaned manholes, was as a splicer's helper
in 1943 with Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. in Grand Forks, N.D.
   Twenty-three years later, Olson had moved through the ranks of
the company to become vice president and general manager in its
Iowa area. He was transferred to Indiana Bell as vice president for
operations in 1970 and became president of that company two years
later.
   In 1974, Olson assumed the presidency of Illinois Bell and in
1977 became executive vice president of AT&T headquarters in New
York. He was made president and chief operating officer in June
1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979.
   Olson was a graduate of the University of North Dakota and
served on the boards of many companies, business organizations and
charitable groups. Olson is survived by his wife, Jean; a son,
James D. Olson; a daughter, Mrs. Bruce Paterson; a brother and two
sisters.
   Olson's undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of William
McGowan, the chairman of AT&T's long-distance rival MCI
Communications Corp., who suffered a heart attack in December 1986,
received a heart transplant and returned to office in September
1987.
   Both companies drew criticism for failing to announce their
chiefs' illnesses until news leaked out to the press.

   Top leaders of Chrysler Corp. and
the United Auto Workers shook hands and exchanged weight jokes
today before settling down to talks on a contract covering 67,600
workers in nine states.
   UAW President Owen Bieber and Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman
Gerald Greenwald shook hands over a conference table, as did UAW
Vice President Marc Stepp and Chrysler Vice President Anthony St.
John.
   The four joked about Stepp's efforts to lose weight but did not
discuss the negotiations before Bieber, Stepp and St. John went
behind closed doors. Greenwald said he would not take part in the
talks.
   The officials are trying to draft an agreement to replace one
expiring Sept. 14. Bargainers led by Stepp were to spend today and
Tuesday outlining the union's demands.
   Both sides will work within a pattern contract, established last
fall at Ford Motor Co. and adopted at General Motors Corp. The
contract must be fitted to the smaller Chrysler Corp., the nation's
third-largest automaker.
   The UAW also is seeking a two-year duration for the contract so
it will expire with the GM and Ford pacts in 1990. The talks, which
normally would begin in mid-July, cover wages, benefits and working
conditions.
   The pattern contract forbids plant closings not announced before
talks started and layoffs for any reason except production cuts
caused by slow sales.
   It also includes six-month studies in which managers and workers
at each plant search together for ways to make their workplaces
more efficient, including organizing workers into teams on the
assembly line.
   Harley Shaiken, a labor and technology expert at the University
of California, San Diego, said Ford and GM are more interested in
getting workers and managers to examine their plants together than
in the actual results of the studies.
   But at Chrysler, where local unions at six plants have agreed to
so-called Modern Operating Agreements and the company is pushing
for their adoption at all plants, the studies will have a different
interpretation, Shaiken said Sunday.
   ``Chrysler is smaller and it is seeking to make the turn more
rapidly in a direction Ford and GM also are headed in,'' he said.
``For Chrysler, (the studies) would be viewed as directly paving
the way for Modern Operating Agreements.''
   In an interview earlier this year, St. John pointed out the
studies as a highlight of the GM and Ford contracts.
   At plants with the agreements, managers and workers share
decisions and design jobs so they can be performed by a team of
workers. Each team member learns all tasks involved in the team's
assignment.
   Workers can increase the amount they earn by learning additional
jobs. The cross-training cuts down absenteeism costs because fewer
stand-by workers are needed. Teams inspect their own work, reducing
the need for inspectors and workers who repair mistakes.
   Chrysler agreed to early talks after its attempt to sell its
Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary sparked a bitter companywide backlash
that forced it to back down from the sale in early March.
   Also damaging workers' trust in the company was Chrysler's
decision to close a former American Motors Corp. assembly plant in
Kenosha, Wis., by year's end, idling 5,500 workers instead of
keeping them working at least five more years as originally planned.
   Chrysler's contract covers 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off
workers in Alabama, Delaware, California, Indiana, Michigan,
Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

   Stocks weakened today in light trading,
reflecting investor concern about the outlook for interest rates
and inflation following the release of disappointing economic
figures last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, wobbly after a
big weekly loss, fell 14.10 points to 1,999.83 as of 11 a.m. EDT,
back under the 2,000 level for the first time since April 5.
   ``I think people are very jittery,'' said Philip C. Puccio,
senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at
Dillon Read & Co. in New York. ``There's going to be a lot of
volatility, a lot of skittishness.''
   Traders said investors still were reacting to the government's
reports last week of a higher-than-expected February trade deficit
and a jump in March wholesale prices. The reports suggested the
dollar will fall, inflation will rise substantially and the Federal
Reserve will tighten credit.
   Rising oil prices linked to escalating violence in the Persian
Gulf also aggravated fears about inflation, traders said.
   Others said large institutional investors such as pension funds
were fearful of another large drop in the Dow average like the
101.46-point fall last Thursday, despite NYSE restraints on
computerized trading strategies that are designed to slow the speed
and magnitude of the index's movements.
   Declining issues led advances by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 809 down, 464 up and 450 unchanged.
Big Board volume totaled 54.18 million shares after the first 90
minutes.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.71
to 146.29. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
fell 0.77 to 298.47.
   Oil stocks generally were higher because of the Persian Gulf
hostilities, but the gains were relatively small. Chevron rose { to
48|, Amoco rose ] to 77~, and Schlumberger rose { to 36].
   Pacificorp was the Big Board's most-active issue at 34\, down \,

to the utility's quarterly dividend payment.
   American Telephone & Telegraph fell [ to 39~. The company said

   Oil prices moved strongly higher today, driven
by heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf, concerns about an
upcoming OPEC meeting and technical factors, one analyst said.
   Near midday, contracts for May delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $18.81 per
42-gallon barrel, up 44 cents from Friday's closing price on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined products, May contracts for wholesale unleaded
gasoline were up 1.04 cents at 53.65 cents per gallon, while
wholesale heating oil contracts were up 1.05 cents at 50.80 cents
per gallon.
   Mary T. Bergonia, an analyst at E.D.& F. Man International
Futures Inc., said ``war talk'' was mainly responsible, as traders
worried that escalating hostilities in the Persian Gulf region
might result in restrictions on supplies.
   In Washington today, the White House said President Reagan had
struck at Iranian oil platforms to punish Iran for the mine attack
that nearly sank a U.S. frigate and to warn the Iranians against
sowing new mines in the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon said an Iranian navy frigate responded by firing
missiles at U.S. aircraft, while an Iranian guided missile patrol
boat fired on the cruiser Wainwright. It added that the frigate was
attacked and set afire by U.S. planes and an American destroyer.
   Aside from the war action, Ms. Bergonia said traders were also
``nervous'' about a scheduled April 26 meeting between five members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC
producers.
   That meeting will be followed by a full conference by
representatives of all 13 nations in the cartel.
   Any agreement to limit output could also send prices higher.
   In addition, the analyst said, technical factors were also
supporting the market.
   Noting that the May crude contract will expire at the close of
trading Wednesday, she said traders believed that more industry
buying was likely before then.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders said prices were heavily influenced by the actions of
Chicago-based C&D Commodities, the largest speculative firm on the
floor of the exchange. C&D had sparked a sharp downturn in soybean
prices last Friday by selling large amounts of soybean futures and
options contracts.
   Grain futures started to rally this morning, but C&D became a
large seller once again, and prices fell.
   ``They (C&D) don't really control the market, but their
influence is real strong right now'' because of a lack of fresh
fundamental news, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   He said that in the absence of fresh news about basic supply and
demand factors, C&D's actions could have a fairly large impact on
futures prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.11} a bushel; corn was unchanged
to { cent higher with May at $2.03 a bushel; oats were unchanged to
1 cent higher with May at $1.61 a bushel; soybeans were { cent
lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $6.62 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .35 cent lower with April at 73.80
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher
with April at 79.52 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .20
cent higher with April at 44.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher with May at 51.95 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures closed mostly higher on Friday while pork futures
retreated.

<TEXT>
   Facet Enterprises, which has been fighting
off an unfriendly takeover attempt by the Prospect Group Inc.,
announced today that it has agreed to be acquired by Pennzoil Co.
in a deal worth $250.8 million.
   Pennzoil will pay $32 per share for all outstanding Facet
shares, topping Prospect's most recent offer of $27.50 apiece. The
New York-based Prospect announced it was extending its offer to 5
p.m. EDT.
   The Pennzoil offer came less than two weeks after Pennzoil
received a $3 billion cash settlement from Texaco Inc. to end their
four-year legal battle over Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil
Co.
   But Bob Harper, spokesman for Pennzoil in Houston, said the
company had cash available for the acquisition before the
settlement with Texaco.
   ``We had been looking at this possibility for a number of weeks
prior to the settlement,'' Harper said. ``I really don't think that
you can put those two things together.''
   Harper said the board of directors and senior management of
Pennzoil will meet in June to discuss options for other
acquisitions. He said the Facet acquisition would be the largest
for Pennzoil in several years.
   Tulsa-based Facet manufactures and markets filters under the
Purolator brand name and for the private label market. It also
manufactures and markets transportation components, filters and
filtration systems and oil field production equipment.
   The agreement with Pennzoil was unanimously approved by the
Facet board of directors, Facet said in a statement.
   Under the plan, a cash tender offer by a subsidiary of Pennzoil
will commence as soon as practical for all shares of Facet common
stock at $32 per share net in cash. After completion of the tender
offer, Facet will be merged with Pennzoil's subsidiary.
   Pennzoil has informed Facet that it has sufficient cash to
complete the transaction and that there are no financing conditions
to the tender offer and merger.
   ``We are delighted that our efforts to maximize stockholders'
investment in Facet have resulted in an agreement which provides a
fair price for their shares,'' said James Malone, president and
chief executive officer of Facet.
   Randal McDonald, Pennzoil's president and chief operating
officer, said his company, as a substantial customer of Facet
``intends to operate the company as a separate entity headquartered
in Tulsa with its present employees.''
   Facet had rejected two tender offers from Prospect, including
the current bid.
   Prospect's $135.7 million cash offer was to have expired April
6, but the New York company announced a series of extensions.
   In doing so, Prospect revealed that it had been tendered since
late last year 247,170 shares of Facet common stock, an amount that
Facet said indicated shareholders were not taking advantage of the
Prospect offer.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks reopened in Panama today for
the first time in six weeks but only to receive deposits. Business
was brisk but most customers appeared wary.
   Most people deposited checks, which they have been unable to
cash since the banks were closed on March 4.
   ``I'll keep my cash at home,'' said Frank Farrell, one of about
20 people lined up to make deposits at Chase Manhattan Bank when it
opened. ``Later on, maybe, I'll deposit cash.''
   A retiree, Farrell said he was depositing about a half dozen
dividend checks. Asked if he felt secure in depositing them, he
replied: ``I don't worry. Chase is solid.''
   A middle-aged Panamanian woman in the same line said she also
was depositing checks only.
   ``I need the cash to eat,'' she said.
   It was unclear when the banks would allow withdrawals.
   The banks reopened today after the National Banking Commission,
the government's bank regulator, said the banks could resume
accepting deposits and carrying out inter-bank operations.
   They were closed March 3 after a month-long run on deposits
turned into a stampede in late February when Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the nation's strongman, dismissed then President Eric
Arturo Delvalle.
   The Reagan administration furthered the economic crisis by
imposing sanctions on Panama, including freezing Panamanian assets
in the United States, in an effort to force Noriega to leave his
post.
   Noriega, chief of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces, is
under federal indictment in the United States on charges of drug
trafficking and money laundering.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle as the nation's leader.
Delvalle was deposed after he ordered Noriega to step down.
   In other developments, a Roman Catholic priest on Sunday told
worshipers not to be intimidated by riot police who have crushed
demonstrations against Noriega.
   Hundreds of people stood and cheered repeatedly during the
homily by the Rev. Javier Villanueva at the Christ the King Church.
   ``There is no suffering, no blow from a truncheon or a stream of
poisonous water, nor an insult, nor criticism, nor pain that does
not form part of the suffering of Christ,'' he told about 500
people.
   On Saturday, police trucks equipped with water cannons fired a
mixture of tear gas and water at about 400 demonstrators, most of
whom were members of an opposition women's group, during a march on
the north side of Panama City.

   Stocks weakened this morning in reaction to
falling bond prices, concern about inflation and U.S.-Iranian
fighting in the Persian Gulf.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, wobbly after a
big weekly loss, was down 11.28 points to 2,002.65 as of noon EDT.
   ``I think people are very jittery,'' said Philip C. Puccio,

   Anxiety about inflation contributed to a selloff in bond prices
this morning that pushed yields on the 30-year issue past 9
percent, the highest level in three months. To many investors, this
made bonds more attractive and less risky than stocks.
   Rising oil prices linked to escalating violence in the Persian
Gulf also aggravated fears about inflation, traders said.
   Others said large institutional investors such as pension funds
were fearful of another large drop in the Dow average like the
101.46-point fall last Thursday, despite NYSE restraints on

   Five OPEC oil ministers will meet their
counterparts from independent oil-producing countries April 26 in
efforts to stabilize sagging oil prices, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries reported.
   An employee of OPEC's information secretariat said Monday both
the meeting with non-OPEC countries and a subsequent extraordinary
meeting of oil ministers from all 13 OPEC countries will take place
at the group's headquarters.
   The second meeting will take place on April 28.
   Each session was originally planned for three days earlier. No
reason was given Monday for the change.
   After five OPEC oil ministers met here on April 9, OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister,
announced the upcoming talks to consider halting an oil price slide.
   Lukman and the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Venezuela
and Indonesia have invited at least seven non-OPEC oil producing
nations to meet them on April 26. Big producers such as the Soviet
Union, Britain and Norway are unlikely to be represented.
   According to the Nicosia, Cyprus,-based Middle East Economic
Survey, an influential weekly specializing in oil, the seven
nations were Mexico, Oman, Egypt, China, Colombia, Malaysia and
Angola.

   In announcing the earnings ahead of the company's annual meeting
in New York, Goodrich Chairman John D. Ong noted that the massive
restructuring the former tiremaker undertook a few years ago is
``now producing the expected results.''
   Goodrich reported net income of $34.7 million, or $1.29 a share,
for the quarter, up from net income of $3.8 million, or 6 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period.
   Sales during the quarter ended March 31 totaled $588 million, up
17 percent from $485.6 million in the first quarter of 1987.
   Operating income from the company's largest business _ polyvinyl
chloride, or PVC _ jumped 126 percent, to $57.6 million from $25.5
million in the year-earlier quarter.
   PVC is used by pipe and plastics manufacturers and in siding for
homes. Though a cyclical business, PVC as well as the raw materials
used in making it currently are in short supply because of a robust
economy, the company said.
   Ong noted that Goodrich expects to complete the sale of the
company's interest in Uniroyal Goodrich within the next two months,
closing out the 118-year-old company's association with rubber
products.
   During the first quarter, Goodrich's stake in Uniroyal resulted
in a $3.3 million loss, mainly because of ``costs associated with a
reduction in salaried enrollment,'' Ong said.
   Goodrich announced in December that an investment group formed
by Clayton & Dubilier Inc. agreed to buy its interest in Uniroyal
for $225 million.
   Analysts who met with Goodrich executives before the annual
meeting noted that the additional cash, which will work to
substantially reduce the company's debt-to-capital ratio, could
make Goodrich vulnerable to a takeover.
   Ong and other executives stressed that they are actively working
to ``see where we can invest ... to enhance our core businesses.''
   One analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
Goodrich management ``knows that that much cash in the bank is
dangerous.''

   Libya has formed a $500 million
investment corporation to acquire oil facilties abroad, a published
report said.
   The Middle East Economic Survey said in its Monday edition that
the company, to be known as the Foreign Petroleum Investment
Corporation, was formed by Libya's National Oil Company.
   The Nicosia, Cyprus,-based weekly newsletter, which specializes
in oil, added that the new company will act as a holding company
for two investments already made by Libya _ a 70 percent stake in
Tamoil's 100,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Cremona, Italy, and a
50 percent interest in the 80,000-barrel-per-day Coastal refinery
in Hamburg, West Germany.
   A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons.
   MEES said Muhammad Abd al-Jawad has been appointed head of the
new corporation. He is also chairman of Tamoil.

<HEAD>Time-Release Fertilizer Holds Promise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine a world where the chore of
fertilizing the lawn becomes a once-a-year job, where farmers
drastically cut the work and expense of getting crops to grow,
where pesticides are safer _ all because of a micro-thin plastic
coating.
   It's an idea that a University of Dayton researcher and a major
Ohio-based fertilizer company are nourishing in a Dayton laboratory.
   It has its roots in the coatings that drug companies have been
using for years on time-release capsules.
   Now Richard P. Chartoff, a professor of materials engineering,
and O.M. Scott & Sons of Marysville are trying encapsulation on a
larger scale for fertilizers.
   ``I think now the question is, can we take that same technology
and apply it to the agricultural area?'' said Michael P. Kelty,
director of technology development for Scott.
   Farmers and homeowners could afford to waste some nutrients by
having them wash away, he said.
   But Kelty sees a day when prices rise again, requiring a product
that keeps more of the fertilizer where it is needed until it is
used by the plants.
   ``Fertilizer's been cheap, labor's been cheap and the input cost
has been relativily small. As fertilizer gets more expensive, you
look at other ways,'' he said.
   Scott, which approached the university for help, is providing
$56,000 for the feasibility study; the state's Edison Seed
Development Fund is providing another $50,000. Chartoff hopes
within a year to have some sample product from the laboratory.
   To succeed, all he has to do is take fairly large granules of
urea fertilizer that dissolve easily, find an appropriate plastic
coating and figure out a way to spray it on or make it form plastic
by a chemical reaction on the surface of the granule.
   The coating must let water and bacteria in to dissolve it
gradually _ but not too much or the granule will swell and rupture
the plastic.
   ``There's sort of a balancing act we have to do in designing the
coating,'' Chartoff said. The plastic also has to release just
enough of the right kind of nutrient when the plant needs it, and
it must do it over a growing season.
   ``The concept is easy, but the science behind it is rather
difficult,'' said Chartoff, 48, who has been working in polymer
science for 25 years.
   Some products exist. Scott makes a sulfur-coated product, but
the sulfur degrades into sulfuric acid and the process is uneven.
Other coatings are so expensive they can be used only by nurseries
where plants can be worth thousands of dollars an acre, Kelty said.
   ``It's an engineering problem. We know that the particles can be
coated, but the question is, what kind of process can we come up
with that is cost effective?'' Chartoff said.
   The program caught the eye of Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste's speech
writers. He mentioned it in his State of the State address as an
example of business-state partnerships in developing technologies.
   ``I was surprised when I found out'' that Celeste had mentioned
it, Chartoff said. ``It's a rather small demonstration program, but
it's the kind of thing that sounds interesting.''
   One of the biggest benefits could be environmental; a
considerable amount of fertilizer runs off fields into streams and
rivers.
   ``If we do it right, the stuff will be used up as it's released
and there will be relatively small runoff,'' Chartoff said.
   The U.S. pesticide and fertilizer market is estimated at $20
billion per year, according to Scott's technical abstract.
   Kelty said Scott is more likely to aim at a $1 billion chunk of
that for lawns and nursery plants.
   Scott is emphasizing only fertilizer for now. But Kelty sees
applications to pesticides and expects that environmental concerns
eventually will push encapsulation technology into the market for
chemicals used for grain and other crops.
   Even if Chartoff's work is successful, however, Kelty said it
would take three to five more years to bring the idea to full-scale
development.

   Olin Corp. said Monday it has tentatively
agreed to acquire General Defense Corp., a leading manufacturer of
heavy ammunition and tactical systems, from Clabir Corp. in a deal
valued at $104 million.
   Olin said it signed a letter of intent to make the acquisition
that would ``establish Olin as a prime systems contractor in
large-caliber ammunition.''
   The transaction is contingent upon government approval and
General Defense's receipt of a fiscal 1988 production award under
its contract with the Army for 120mm tank ammunition.
   It is also subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement and
approval by the boards of both companies.
   Olin said it hopes to conclude the acquisition within two
months. The value it placed on the transaction includes $24 million
in General Defense debt.
   General Defense, based in York, Pa., had sales of $159 million
last year. Its parent company, Clabir, is based in Greenwich.
   Olin is among the top 50 defense suppliers in sales to the U.S.
government. Its business is primarily in chemicals, metals and
water quality management.

<HEAD>Japanese Again Ask United States To Lift Semiconductor Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan again asked the United States on Monday to
lift trade sanctions imposed last year by President Reagan as a
result of American complaints over semiconductors sales.
   Japan said that it had complied with requests to open its
markets to U.S.-made computer chips and that continued sanctions
would only irritate Japanese manufacturers.
   The comments were made as Japan and the United States met in
quarterly talks to review Japan's progress in opening its markets
to the U.S.-made chips. The sanctions entered their second year
Sunday with no sign of a letup in the tough U.S. stance.
   ``Continuing these sanctions will only damage the United States
in the minds of Japanese users,'' said a trade official affiliated
with the talks, who agreed to discuss the matter only if granted
anonymity. ``We find these sanctions very irritating.''
   Reagan accused Japan of violating a 1986 agreement by selling
semiconductors at below-market prices and failing to open its home
market to American-made computer chips. He retaliated with tariffs
of 100 percent on Japanese color television sets, calculators,
computers and power drills.
   Reagan later reduced the tariffs by $51 million, saying Japan
had made partial progress in complying with the agreement.
   Shortly after the sanctions were announced, Sony Chairman Akio
Morita said the action was regarded in Japan as the ``second coming
of the black ships.''
   Morita was referring to 1853, when U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry
sailed into Shimoda harbor southwest of Tokyo and forced Japan _ at
gunpoint _ to open its ports after two centuries of isolation.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter recently told Japanese
officials that it was still too early to lift the sanctions, and
that market access is still lower than expected.
   Yeutter drew exasperated reactions from the Japanese trade
official, a representative of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   ``It's unreasonable, I think, to continue the sanctions now. I
think their expectations are too high. They expect to get 20
percent of the Japanese market in five years. I think it will be
very difficult for them to achieve a 20 percent share,'' the
Japanese official said.
   ``It's time for (Japanese) users and U.S. makers to cooperate to
increase sales to Japan,'' he added.
   According to figures compiled by MITI, U.S. chipmakers have
increased their sales in Japan by 50 percent to 60 percent.
However, the U.S. share of the market has not grown significantly
because the Japanese market itself has expanded rapidly, creating
greater demand.
   Some Japanese companies were able to avoid significant impact
from the sanctions by transferring production of the affected
merchandise, such as portable computers, to the United States.
Other companies were hit hard by the sanctions. According to some
estimates, the damage inflicted on Japanese companies has already
surpassed the $300 million.
   The United States estimates American firms also have lost $300
million in sales in Japan because of the Japanese practices. But a
U.S. Embassy spokesman earlier said the sanctions never were
destined to end when the damage they inflicted on Japan equalled
that suffered by American companies. He said the sanctions will
continue ``until the basic situation changes.''
   The embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
part of Japan's $300 million figure represents tariffs collected on
Japanese products coming into the United States, and part
represents goods kept off the U.S. market because the Japanese can
no longer compete at the higher prices.
   The MITI official said Japan-U.S. talks would not be affected by
a dispute among the European Economic Community, Japan and the
United States over the semiconductor agreement.
   The EEC has requested a three-way meeting to try and resolve
European complaints that the original chip agreement between Japan
and the United States violates international trade rules
established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer, said today its profit for the first three months of 1988
fell more than 37 percent due to sharp earnings declines in its
retail and insurance divisions.
   Sears posted first-quarter net income of $179.5 million, or 47
cents a share, down from $287.9 million, or 75 cents a share, in
the same period a year earlier.
   Quarterly sales increased 16 percent, from $10.48 billion in
1987 to $12.16 billion, a record for first-quarter revenue, Sears
said in a statement.
   Despite a 4.6 percent increase in sales at Sears department and
specialty stores to $6.04 billion, income from the Sears
Merchandise Group fell to $18.7 million from $31.3 million a year
earlier.
   Edward A. Brennan, Sears chairman and chief executive officer,
said traditional business patterns produce the lowest sales of the
year in the first quarter while fixed costs remain constant.
   The Allstate Insurance Group reported first-quarter income of
$183.2 million, down from $246.9 million a year earlier. The
company said the results were adversely affected by the return of
normal winter weather patterns compared with mild conditions _ and
fewer claims _ a year earlier. Revenue for Allstate rose 35.5
percent, to $4.94 billion.
   The Dean Witter Financial Services Group was the company's best
performer, with first-quarter income of $15.5 million, up from $6.1
million a year earlier. The Discover Card, an all-purpose credit
card, recorded its first quarterly profit _ $6.4 million _ after
two years of heavy investment and start-up expenses.
   Tax reform accounted for $35.5 million of the decrease in income
from Allstate, Sears said.
   The Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group reported first-quarter
income of $7.5 million, down sharply from $39.3 million a year
earlier.
   Brennan said the decline in income was expected ``but this
should not be regarded as an indicator of results for the year.''
   ``We continue to be quite optimistic about the economy,''
Brennan said in a statement. ``Consumer confidence has rebounded to
a level higher than the pre-October peak. Recent employment growth
has been rapid and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level
since 1979. We expect disposable personal income to register a
healthy 7.5 percent increase in 1988 compared with 5.3 percent in
1987. This favorable atmosphere should benefit all our businesses.''

   Stocks weakened today in reaction to falling
bond prices, concern about inflation and U.S.-Iranian fighting in
the Persian Gulf.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, wobbly after a
big weekly loss, was down 10.78 points to 2,003.15 as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   ``I think people are very jittery,'' said Philip C. Puccio,
senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at
Dillon Read & Co. in New York. ``There's going to be a lot of
volatility, a lot of skittishness.''
   Traders said investors still were reacting to the government's
reports last week of a higher-than-expected February trade deficit
and a jump in March wholesale prices. The reports suggested the
dollar will fall, inflation will rise substantially and the Federal
Reserve will tighten credit.
   Anxiety about inflation contributed to a selloff in bond prices
this morning that pushed yields on the 30-year issue past 9
percent, the highest level in three months. To many investors, this
made bonds more attractive and less risky than stocks.
   Rising oil prices linked to escalating violence in the Persian
Gulf also aggravated fears about inflation, traders said.
   Others said large institutional investors such as pension funds
were fearful of another large drop in the Dow average like the
101.46-point fall last Thursday, despite NYSE restraints on
computerized trading strategies that are designed to slow the speed
and magnitude of the index's movements.
   Declining issues led advances by about 3-to-2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 853 down, 570 up and 483 unchanged. Big Board
volume totaled 103.41 million shares with two hours of trading left.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.60
to 146.40. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
fell 0.28 to 298.96.
   Oil stocks were mixed, despite a jump in petroleum prices caused
by the Persian Gulf hostilities. Amoco rose | to 78[, Chevron rose
] to 48{, Texaco fell { to 48[ and Exxon fell ] to 43\.
   Pacificorp was the Big Board's most-active issue at 34, down {,
on volume exceeding 15 million shares. The heavy trading was linked
to the utility's quarterly dividend payment.
   American Telephone & Telegraph fell [ to 26{. The company said
its chairman James E. Olson died of cancer. Sears Roebuck fell | to
34\. The retailer reported a decline in first-quarter earnings.
   On the Amex, Texas Air was among the most active issues, down |

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange ended
higher Monday, but well below their midday highs because of Wall
Street's weak opening.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 9.2
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,787.8.
   The index had been up as much as 23.8 points around midday.
   Volume was a light 416.9 million shares, down from 472.9 million
Friday.
   The market initially was pushed higher by Friday's rise on Wall
Street. Also boosting share prices was speculation early Monday
that the Bank of England might signal a further cut in the
commercial banks' base lending rate. The key interest rate
currently stands at 8 percent.
   But as New York shares declined Monday, the London market began
to fall back.
   ``There was a markdown after Wall Street opened and we drifted

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States dropped by 12 this week to total 904, Baker Hughes
Inc. announced Monday.
   The rig count, the widely-watched industry index of drilling
activity, had fallen by 25 the previous week to total 916.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs
producing oil.
   A year ago, the count was 750.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Texas was the big loser
this week as its count dropped by 13. Among other oil producing
states, Oklahoma lost five rigs, California four, North Dakota
three, Michigan two and Pennsylvania one.
   The rig count in Louisiana rose by six, New Mexico gained five
rigs, Wyoming, Ohio and Colorado each gained two, while Kansas was
unchanged.

<HEAD>Japanese Again Ask United States To Lift Semiconductor Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asserting it has opened its market to U.S.-made
computer chips, Japan today repeated earlier requests that United
States remove trade restrictions imposed by President Ronald Reagan
last year.
   The move came as officials of both countries met for quarterly
talks to review the status of moves to open U.S. access to the
Japanese chip market.
   Reagan imposed the ban a year ago Sunday, claiming the Japanese
had broken a 1986 agreement by selling semiconductors, the chips
used in computers, at prices below market prices and failing to
open its home market to American-made computer chips.
   He later reduced the tariffs by $51 million, saying Japan had
made partial progress in complying with the agreement.
   The U.S. action put a 100 percent tariff on Japanese-made power
drills, computers and color television sets.
   One representative of Japan's Ministry of International Trade
and Industry, who declined to be identified, said continuing the
ban would only hurt the United States image among that country's
users. He called the ban ``very irritating.''
   He dismissed as ``unreasonable'' recent assertions by Clayton
Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative, that it was still too early
to lift the sanctions, and that market access is still lower than
expected.
   According MITI figures, U.S. chipmakers have increased their
sales in Japan by 50 percent to 60 percent. But the U.S. share of
the market has not grown significantly because the Japanese market
itself has expanded rapidly, creating greater demand.
   Some Japanese estimates claim the damage inflicted on Japanese
companies has surpassed $300 million. American firms also have lost
$300 million in sales in Japan because of the Japanese practices,
according to U.S. officials.

<DATELINE>MEEKER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malcolm Bricklin, the flamboyant
entrepreneur who brought the Yugo automobile to America, once
imported optimism to this depressed ranching town with
multimillion-dollar investments _ but worry has replaced hope as
his unpaid bills pile up.
   The town has been through this before, most recently with the
oil shale bust of 1982, when big promises and heavy spending on
expensive oil production techniques evaporated overnight.
   But Meeker's 1,800 residents don't want it to happen again, and
they hope Bricklin, who plans to sell his daring auto business,
soon will settle his debts and resume building on his lavish ranch
and youth camp 22 miles from town up the White River.
   Liens of more than $107,000 are on file against the 49-year-old
Bricklin in the Rio Blanco County Courthouse, and subcontractors
throughout Colorado's Western Slope are waiting for their money.
   ``A little guy can't carry this kind of money and I'm not sure
he understands this,'' said Neil Bratton, the owner of a Grand
Junction window company who claims Bricklin owes him a substantial
amount.
   Even Bricklin's chief aide, Pat Carfagno, admits the ranch,
where the importer hoped to establish a part-time personal
residence, owes $150,000 just in Meeker, which is in northwest
Colorado about 200 miles from Denver.
   But Carfagno said the scheduled sale of Bricklin's interests in
Global Motors for more than $20 million will free up enough cash to
satisfy western Colorado creditors and to continue Bricklin's plans
for an expensive youth camp on his property.
   Officials with Global Motors disclosed late last week that an
investor group planned to buy out Bricklin's stake in the firm,
which brought the Yugo to this country in 1985.
   ``We have been in a cash shortage and we've been honest with
people about that,'' said Carfagno, who has worked with Bricklin
for 21 years.
   ``We've run $7 million through this town in the last year,'' she
said, the bulk of it in land purchases.
   ``We're here and we're staying,'' she said.
   Townspeople hope Carfagno is right.
   Bricklin, who moved to Colorado from New York City, has suffered
some setbacks of his own. His Yugo business, although initially
successful, began to unravel as the Yugoslavian import gained a
reputation for consumer complaints. Earlier, in the 1970s, Bricklin
failed in his bid to popularize a gull-winged, plastic sports car
that bore his name.
   Lured by the idea of slow western living and spectacular
scenery, Bricklin came to Rio Blanco County in the winter of 1987.
He bought the financially troubled bowling alley in Meeker and
donated $10,000 a month to the Chamber of Commerce to promote town
events ranging from rodeos to sled dog races.
   Meeker folks say he provided jobs for many people who otherwise
would have had to leave the wide open country they love.
   But two months ago, he stopped paying his bills.
   ``I'm cautiously, skeptically optimistic,'' said Jan Hughley, a
motel owner and newly elected mayor of Meeker. ``He's done a lot
for Meeker and I hope he gets things squared away. But we have to
be careful because we've seen this before.''
   Carfagno, Bricklin and other members of the household spend
little time in Meeker. So to many, they remain outsiders, and
Eastern outsiders at that.
   Under construction at the ranch are a sprawling house, small
dams to provide ponds and waterfalls, corrals, outbuildings and a
road to the proposed youth camp.
   The house features a huge glass-enclosed swimming pool, a master
bathroom large enough to include a fireplace and a master bedroom
lined by windows that offer a panoramic view of the rushing river
and the mountains above.
   ``You gotta admit this is pretty nice,'' observed Bill Phillips,
the project engineer, who said he almost was forced out of Meeker
for lack of work until Bricklin came along.
   ``He's going to put $3 million into the camp's first-year
construction and the total probably will be $16 million to $20
million. I'm not worried,'' Phillips said.
   The camp already is being marketed in the East, at $2,900 per
child for an eight-week stint in the Rockies. A pool complex,
riding stables, tennis courts, cabins and support buildings are
planned, with the opening scheduled for June 29.
   Bricklin has offered a reduced camp rate for Rio Blanco County
children but Phillips expects few will show up.
   ``Why should they? Kids are in camp all the time just living
around here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Key Natural Gas Regulation, Union Dues, Other
Matters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court rejected appeals by natural gas pipeline
companies Monday to invalidate a key federal regulation aimed at
promoting competition in their industry, a ruling that affects
billions of dollars in sales.
   In other business-related matters, the court affirmed that
workers may not be fired for refusing on religious grounds to pay
union dues. It also rejected the use in cosmetics of color
additives that could cause cancer, and it agreed to decide whether
donations to the Church of Scientology are tax-deductible.
   In the natural-gase case, the court left intact a regulation
that under certain conditions requires pipeline companies to
transport gas sold by other producers and traders. Pipeline
companies had complained that the rule hurt them economically by
forcing them to carry gas from competitors.
   A federal appeals court had rejected earlier appeals by the
pipeline companies, saying they apparently were trying to stifle
competition by attempting to invalidate the rule.
   In the union-dues case, the Supreme Court rejected without
comment an appeal by a Seattle machinists union that was attempting
to force Boeing Co. employee Thomasine Nichols to pay union dues.
The company declined to fire her although her refusal to pay dues
violated its contract with the union.
   Ms. Nichols argued that her religious beliefs bar her from
paying dues to unions and she offered to donate the equivalent
amount to a charity. An appeals court said she was protected from
dismissal by federal civil rights law.
   In the cosmetics case, the Supreme Court refused to let the
government approve the cosmetic-industry use of two color additives
that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer, despite company claims
that the substances are safe.
   An appeals court had ruled that federal law prohibits the Food
and Drug Administration from approving the substances, orange dye
No. 17 and red dye No. 19, though the cancer risks are ``trivial.''
   In the Scientology case, the court agreed to rule on whether
payments called ``fixed donations'' made to the Church of
Scientology by members can be deducted from federal income taxes.
   The Internal Revenue Service has argued that the payments cannot
be counted as tax-deductible charitable contributions.
Scientologists have argued that the IRS has singled out their
church for unfair treatment.
   The Supreme Court's decision is not expected until sometime next
year.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures also advanced
while wheat declined slightly.
   The soybean market showed its underlying strength by rallying
despite fairly heavy selling early in the session by speculative
interests, analysts said.
   ``We're in a bull market and the market just doesn't want to go
down,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds

   Wheat was pressured by speculative selling and by reports of
beneficial weekend rains in the wheat fields of Kansas, Oklahoma
and Texas, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.11\ a bushel; corn was {

   Stocks closed mixed in quiet trading today,
lower through most of the session but recovering part of the loss
by late afternoon.
   The light volume suggested that many investors refrained from
participating in the market and most of the trading was limited to
the major brokerages. Fears about the outlook for interest rates
was a major reason for a slow day.
   ``Nobody on the face of this earth can tell which way this
market's going for the rest of the week,'' said Robert O'Toole,
manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   Falling prices in the bond market pushed yields on
s@O6k~yxL'easury issues past the 9 percent threshhold, the highest
in three
months. This made bonds more attractive than stocks to people
looking for a safe investment.

<HEAD>Prices Fade After Runup On Persian Gulf Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices jumped after the latest round of
shooting between the United States and Iran, but lost most of the
gains in later trading Monday.
   Analysts said production from other sources would sharply
diminish the impact of any cutoff of oil from the Persian Gulf
states, but they said the market still reacted with typical
skittishness at the prospect.
   They attributed the market's afternoon weakness to profit-taking
and technical factors.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at
$18.52 per 42-gallon barrel, up 15 cents from Friday's closing
price _ but down 40 cents from its midday high of $18.92 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined products, May contracts for wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled up 0.69 cent at 53.30 cents a gallon, while
wholesale heating oil contracts were up 0.75 cents at 50.50 cents a
gallon.
   In Washington, officials said U.S. Navy vessels destroyed two
offshore Iranian oil platforms, sank a defending Iranian patrol
boat and bombed two Iranian navy frigates in retaliation for a mine
attack that nearly sank a U.S. vessel last week. Iran attacked oil
facilities off Sharjah and fired on at least two U.S. vessels.
   ``There's an overall recognition that if you shut down the gulf,
there's not so big an impact'' on world oil supplies, because of
the number of other producers has grown, said Jayne Ball, an
analyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. investment firm.
   But markets still worry, to the point that ``anything that
happens in that area has got to have an impact on prices,'' she
added.
   Other analysts agreed that the hostilities spurred the early
jump in prices, attributing the later decline mainly to technical
factors and profit-taking.
   The May crude contract expires at the close Wednesday, and so
``a lot of people took advantage of the higher prices and sold
off,'' said Stephen J. McKiernan, president of the McKiernan & Co.
commodities trading firm.
   Ms. Ball said the failure of the May crude contract to break
above $19 discouraged traders, who then began the afternoon selloff.

   A presidential commission concluded Monday
that the U.S. air transport system is safe for the time being, but
urged appointment of a ``safety czar'' in a newly independent
Federal Aviation Administration whose officials would be insulated
from political pressures.
   ``The nation's air transportation system is safe, for now,''
said John M. Albertine, chairman of the Aviation Safety Commission
whose final report was issued after a nine-month study of the
rapidly growing airline industry.
   ``However, that safety is being maintained to an increasing
extent through delays and through what I can only characterize as
heroic efforts of air traffic controllers, airways facilities
technicians, safety inspectors'' and others, Albertine said.
   The report said there was widespread public concern about the
safety of air travel, coinciding with burgeoning technological
advances and a backlog of safety improvements waiting to be written
into government regulations.
   ``Now is the time for decisive action by Congress and the
executive branch,'' the study said.
   The panel recommended that the FAA expand its force of
inspectors and begin conducting surprise inspections of airlines in
addition to pre-announced examinations, to give the airlines
``increased incentives to keep their day-to-day operations in close
conformance with safety regulations.''
   It also urged the Transportation Department agency to publish
stricter safety standards for commuter air carriers, and to require
private planes to contain equipment that can report their altitudes
to ground controllers when they are making a landing approach at
busy airports.
   The report proposed a dramatic restructuring of the FAA,
including appointment of a ``safety czar'' within the agency who
could initiate or block proposed air safety regulations.
   Under the panel's plan, the FAA would be removed from the
Transportation Department as an independent body with streamlined
regulatory procedures and greater authority to manage its staff and
purchase equipment.
   The FAA's administrator and the proposed new director of
aviation safety would be appointed by the president to seven-year
terms, in the interest of providing continuity and shielding them
from political influence. The FAA administrator now serves for an
indefinite term, but the post has been characterized by frequent
turnovers.
   Initial reaction to the report was favorable.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation subcommittee on aviation, said the
commission's proposal to remove the agency from the Transportation
Department is a ``much-needed change.''
   Ford is sponsoring a bill that would make the FAA an independent
agency, a proposal endorsed Monday by several industry
organizations.
   Gabriel Phillips, executive vice president of the Air Transport
Association, which represents the nation's airlines, said
reorganization of the FAA ``is the only way to solve'' personnel,
purchasing and other problems.
   The seven members of the commission created by Congress were
appointed last year by President Reagan. They concluded that the
1978 deregulation of the airline industry has not eroded safety, as
some critics have contended.
   While the number of airline passengers has grown from about 250
million in 1978 to 450 million last year, the numbers of accidents,
passenger fatalities and injuries have all decreased, the report
said.
   The commission also said that despite intense airline
competition since deregulation, it found no evidence of any growth
in problems related to maintenance shortcuts, errors by overworked
crews or mistakes by overburdened air traffic controllers.
   ``The safety record has continued to be excellent following
deregulation,'' the report said.
   It also said the FAA should make a priority of inspecting
carriers undergoing expansions, mergers or changes in ownership.
Such events ``can sometimes create difficulties in managing and
controlling operations and maintenance activities,'' it said.
   The commission said a lack of new airports is causing flight
delays and congestion that are inconvenient but rarely result in
accidents.
   The report urged the FAA to study suggestions for using airports
more efficiently, including sale of ``landing slots'' or the
specific times an airline can land a plane and use a terminal.

   James E. Olson, whose bulldog tenacity led him
from manholes in North Dakota to the chairmanship of AT&T, died
unexpectedly Monday after a month-long battle with colon cancer. He
was 62.
   His death came after just 1{ years as leader of American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. The powerfully built chief executive had
cut costs and shaken the company out of the sense of drift that
followed the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   ``Olson did what a lot of people thought was impossible. He
really started to turn the company around,'' said Daniel Rosenbaum,
executive editor of Wiretap, a newsletter in Morristown, N.J.
   Robert E. Allen, 53, AT&T's president and chief operating
officer, will serve as acting chairman and is considered the
favorite to succeed Olson.
   The century-old AT&T has enough management depth that the loss
of Olson is not expected to damage the company. AT&T's stock fell
25 cents a share to $26.37{ in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   Olson died just two days before the company's annual meeting,
which is to be held Wednesday in Denver.
   AT&T's board of directors already had a meeting scheduled for
this week, but company spokeswoman Lynda Beighley said she could
not say whether the board would name a chairman at the time.
   Olson's deterioration was rapid. The company said the cancer was
diagnosed after he became ill with flu on March 18. He had surgery
seven days later for removal of a tumor in the colon. He returned
home on April 1 and had been undergoing chemotherapy as an
outpatient since. He died at home in Short Hills, N.J.
   ``All of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of
Jim's death,'' Allen said in a statement. ``He was a dynamic and
visionary leader. We will miss him. Our legacy to him will be the
vigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out for
us during his 20 months as our leader.''
   AT&T had been criticized for not making Olson's illness public
until news leaked out to the press last week.
   The situation was reminiscent of that of William McGowan, the
chairman of AT&T's long-distance rival MCI Communications Corp. MCI
did not disclose that McGowan had received a heart transplant until
two weeks after the April 1987 operation. McGowan returned to
office in September.
   As recently as the end of last week, AT&T spokesmen were saying
Olson was recuperating. Walter Murphy, a spokesman, said Monday:
``That was the best of our knowledge at the time. Everybody here is
in shock.''
   Under Olson, AT&T cut 27,000 employees, closed some plants and
unified parts of the company that had been separated under the
consent decree that broke up the company.
   Olson was a blunt but gregarious executive who demanded results
and saw his own rise through the corporate ranks as an inspiration
for the rest of the company's 303,000 employees.
   He landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17, during the
summer of 1943, when he hauled buckets of silt out of telephone
manholes in North Dakota. Disdaining the fashion of boardrooms, he
wore short-sleeved shirts throughout his career.
   ``I think our employees know, deep down, that I'm one of them,''
he said in an interview with a free-lance writer for Delta
Airlines' in-flight magazine, Sky, that has not yet been published.
   Olson was 5-feet-10, 175 pounds, jowly and mostly bald with
broad shoulders and muscular forearms. He was not fragile.
   ``Jim Olson was the ultimate tough guy. ... I think he instilled
a real sense of pride and determination in an AT&T workforce that
at that time needed it,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst for the
investment firm PaineWebber Inc.
   ``I think he leaves AT&T in good hands,'' Grubman said. ``If
this had happened a year ago, it would have been extremely
disruptive.''
   Allen is considered to be AT&T's almost certain choice as a
successor to Olson. Analysts describe him as more soft-spoken than
Olson, a person who favors looking at the big picture.
   ``His style is probably more overtly executive (than Olson's),''
Grubman said. But the differences do not run too deep, because
Olson had been grooming Allen as his successor.
   Olson, a native of Devils Lake, N.D., was born Dec. 3, 1925. His
father was a barber and his mother a teacher.
   The same summer that he cleaned manholes in 1943, he got work as
a cable splicer's helper with Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. in
Grand Forks, N.D.
   Twenty-three years later, Olson had moved through the ranks of
the company to become vice president and general manager in its
Iowa area. He was transferred to Indiana Bell as vice president for
operations in 1970 and became president of that company two years
later.
   In 1974, Olson assumed the presidency of Illinois Bell and in
1977 became executive vice president of AT&T headquarters in New
York. He was made president and chief operating officer in June
1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979.
   In September 1986, Olson took office as chairman, succeeding
Charles L. Brown, who retired.
   Olson was a graduate of the University of North Dakota and
served on the boards of many companies, business organizations and
charitable groups. He served 2{ years in the U.S. Army Air Corps.

<HEAD>Pfizer, Lilly Post 14 Percent First Quarter Profit Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co., two major pharmaceutical
manufacturers, each reported Monday that their first quarter profit
rose by about 14 percent this year from the same period of 1987.
   New York-based Pfizer stated its net income for the quarter rose
to $219.8 million, or $1.31 per share, from $192 million, or $1.13
per share, a year earlier. Its sales rose to $1.3 billion from $1.1
billion in first quarter 1987.
   Lilly, based in Indianapolis, posted a first quarter profit of
$233.2 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with a profit of
$205.2 million, or $1.40 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales rose to $1.07 billion from $967.2 million a year earlier.
   Pfizer reported strong sales gains in all of its business
segments: health care, specialty chemicals, materials science,
consumer goods and agricultural products.
   Sales of Pfizer's anti-arthritic drug, Feldene, rose 33 percent
to pace the growth of the company's worldwide sales, Pfizer
reported.
   Lilly stated its sales growth came in both domestic and
international markets, although international sales rose faster.
   Lilly also announced it was investing $110 million for
construction of a new research centers in Indianapolis, to be
completed at its corporate headquarters by 1991. The company called
the project the biggest single capital expense in its 112-year
history.

<HEAD>Judge Concerned About Proposed Consent Decree</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS three new grafs for last graf pvs, Legislation to ... in

   A federal judge expressed reservations Monday
both about signing and rejecting a consent decree to regulate
all-terrain vehicles that critics say won't reduce deaths and
injuries attributed to the machines.
   Rejecting the consent decree would force the government into
time-consuming litigation against manufacturers that would
inevitably delay imposition of any safety measures, U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said at a hearing on the case.
   But signing the decree would restrict the additional measures
the Consumer Product Safety Commission could take to improve the
safety of the vehicles known as ATVs, which have been blamed for
900 deaths and 300,000 injuries in the last five years, Gesell said.
   ``Is it best to move in the direction of doing what one can do
to reduce it as opposed to doing nothing about it?'' Gesell asked
during oral argument on the proposed settlement between the CPSC
and five manufacturers of the vehicles.
   The decree would ban the future sales of three-wheel ATVs unless
the manufacturers devised performance standards that would be
approved by the CPSC. It would also require warning labels on
four-wheel models and distributors would have to offer training
about the safe use of the machiens to owners of vehicles currently
in use.
   Consumer organizations and 32 states have asked Gesell to reject
the consent decree or make modifications on the grounds that it
would not protect consumers from the hazards of 1.5 million
three-wheel ATVs already in use.
   These critics say the decree is incomplete for not providing
refunds for people who already purchased the ATVs, which the
Justice Department called an ``imminent hazard'' late last year
when it announced a temporary consent decree.
   ``It is better than nothing, but it's seriously flawed,'' James
Shannon, attorney general of Massachusetts told Gesell.
   He called the machines ``some of the most dangerous consumer
products sold in this country.''
   Shannon and others criticized provisions of the proposed
settlement that would restrict the CPSC from taking further
enforcement action against ATVs during the 10 years the consent
decree is in effect.
   Gesell said ``the mechanism provided by Congress is stymied by
the consent decree.
   ``As I understand the decree, the agency represented here _ CPSC
_ is not able to issue a rule under the statute which would be in
many respects more severe'' than the sanctions imposed by the
consent decree, Gesell said.
   ``You take the agency out of the game, you can't tell me with
quite the same assurance the agency is going to continue to perform
its function,'' the judge told Howard P. Willens, an attorney
representing the manufacturers and distributors.
   Noting criticism of the CPSC as too slow to take action against
ATVs, the judge questioned the notion that the agency could be
relied upon to vigorously enforce the decree.
   ``The commission had to be led to drink, the commission wasn't
running in here with any eagerness,'' Gesell said.
   But Gesell said ``there is something to be said for a relative
degree of experimentation.''
   The consent decree, unprecedented in consumer product
regulation, could prove ``a technique that could be of great value
to consumers.''
   ``It would be ... in the public interest to have some idea if a
system like this would work,'' Gesell said.
   Gesell said he was not empowered to force the manufacturers to
give refunds to people who bought three-wheel ATVs and rejecting
the decree would result in litigation that could last several years.
   The judge, who indicated he would rule within a week, also
expressed concern that the consent decree lacked deadlines for
compliance with certain provisions and didn't provide a mechanism
for evaluating its enforcement.
   Legislation to force the manufacturers to buy back the machines
is pending in Congress. Among the sponsors is Sen. Alfonse M.
D-Amato, R-N.Y., who briefly spoke at the hearing against the
decree.
   ``I would suggest this is a wolf in sheep's clothing,'' D'Amato
said of the provisions barring further CPSC action against ATVs.
The senator suggested that Gesell modify the decree to give agency
an opportunity to take further action if deaths and injuries have
not been reduced after 12 to 18 months.

<HEAD>Sears' First-Quarter Profit Down 37 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., beset by sluggish retail
sales and sharp declines in income from three of its four major
divisions, said Monday its first-quarter profit fell more that 37
percent from the same period a year ago.
   Sales were up 16 percent, however, and industry analysts agreed
with Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan that the first-quarter income
should not be regarded as an indicator of results for the year.
   The nation's largest retailer reported net income of $179.5
million, or 47 cents a share, for the first three months of 1988,
down from $287.9 million, or 75 cents a share, for the year-earlier
period.
   Revenues increased 16 percent from $10.48 billion in 1987 to
$12.16 billion, a record for first-quarter revenues, Sears said in
a statement.
   Sales within the company's flagship division, the Sears
Merchandise Group, rose just 4.6 percent to $6.04 billion. Income
fell more than 40 percent to $18.7 million.
   The increase in retail sales was tiny compared to the record 47
percent advance a year earlier. Brennan said first-quarter retail
sales are traditionally the lowest of the year and blamed the
income decline on fixed operating costs.
   Income from the Allstate Insurance Group slipped nearly 26
percent to $183.2 million despite a 35.5 percent rise in revenues.
Sears said the results were adversely affected by the return of
normal winter weather patterns compared with mild conditions _ and
fewer claims _ a year ago.
   About $35.5 million of the decrease in Allstate's income was
attributed to tax-reform accounting changes, Sears said.
   The Dean Witter Financial Services Group was the company's best
performer, with first-quarter income of $15.5 million compared to
$6.1 million a year earlier. The Discover Card, an all-purpose
credit card, recorded its first quarterly profit _ $6.4 million _
after two years of heavy investment and start-up expenses.
   And the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group reported first-quarter
income of $7.5 million, down from $39.3 million a year ago.
   Analysts said they were not surprised by Sears' drop in earnings.
   ``I don't take first-quarter earnings as indicative for the
year,'' said John Landschultz of Chicago-based Mesirow Financial
Corp.
   ``But the pressure continues to be on Sears to perform better,''
he said. ``You're getting modest sales gains and you need more.''
   In the wake of the earnings report Monday, Sears shares lost 50
cents to $34.37{ in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Sears announced last month it was undertaking a massive
restructuring of its retail division that could trim as many as
4,000 jobs from the division's headquarters staff.
   The restructuring, which will take up to three years, was
expected to come under questioning by shareholders Tuesday at the
company's annual meeting in Chicago.
   Walter Loeb, senior retail analyst for Morgan Stanley Group Inc.
in New York, said the restructuring program was bound to help Sears
become more competitive in the retail arena.
   ``Three years is a little too long, in my opinion, but it will
be a more aggressive organization,'' he said.
   Brennan said in a statement that he was optimistic about Sears'
growth in light of recent economic indicators.
   ``Consumer confidence has rebounded to a level higher than the
pre-October peak,'' he said. ``Recent employment growth has been
rapid and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 1979.
We expect disposable personal income to register a healthy 7.5
percent increase in 1988 compared with 5.3 percent in 1987. This
favorable atmosphere should benefit all our businesses.''

   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes,
who resigned from his top post at Merrill Lynch & Co. in the wake
of the disclosure that he'd made up quotes for President Reagan,
now says his ``No. 1 goal in life'' is to restore his credibility.
   ``I had no idea that (the quote fabrication) was a problem ... a
major problem,'' Speakes said in an interview published Monday in
the Washington Post. ``It was something I wanted to tell about, but
I wasn't ... saying it was the thing to do. I thought people would
understand that in retrospect I didn't condone it.''
   Speakes stepped down Friday as senior vice president for
communications for Merrill Lynch in the wake of the uproar created
by the disclosure in his book ``Speaking Out.''

   The death Monday of AT&T Chairman James E. Olson
leaves Robert E. Allen at the controls of a phone giant that is
still adjusting to losing its status as the world's largest company
four years ago.
   Olson, 62, cut costs and gave direction to American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. Now Allen, 53, will be under pressure to keep the
momentum going.
   ``Olson had drive, energy and he was a bulldog that you didn't
want to cross,'' said Fulton Holmes, an analyst for Thomson
McKinnon Securities. ``Allen is more sophisticated. Maybe he's got
that inner toughness, but I'm going to hold off six months or a
year until I see it.''
   Allen began serving as acting chairman during Olson's brief bout
with cancer and is expected to be given the nod for the top job by
the board of directors, possibly as soon as this week when the
board meets in conjunction with the annual meeting Wednesday in
Denver.
   AT&T was staggering in September 1986 when Olson took over as
chairman on the retirement of Charles L. Brown. The company had
lost its profitable local phone service monopolies in the 1984
breakup of the Bell System and was losing hundreds of millions of
dollars annually on its computer business, which was supposed to
lead the company into a high-technology future.
   The company also had cut tens of thousands of jobs and morale
was low.
   Olson gathered 27 top executives at a Cape Cod golf resort over
that Labor Day weekend in 1986. They thrashed over the future.
Then, one by one, he asked the executives to stand and asked them,
``Are you with me?''
   Invariably, the reply was yes, Business Week recounted in its
Jan. 18 issue.
   The company is spending heavily on its long-distance network to
solidify its nearly 80 percent share of the interstate
long-distance market. It has cut its losses on computers under the
leadership of Vittorio Cassoni, whom AT&T hired from Italy's
Olivetti. And the company slashed an additional 27,000 jobs in a
sweeping cutback announced shortly before Christmas 1986.
   In 1987, AT&T's profit rose to $2 billion from a scant $139
million the previous year, when earnings were depressed by a huge
writeoff that covered the cost of plant closings, job cuts and
other factors.
   Olson had the difficult job of trying to maintain employee
loyalty at the same time he was overseeing massive layoffs. He
traveled around the country giving speeches to groups of employees
and meeting them personally.
   Under Olson, AT&T has appointed a new tier of managers who
understand the difference between AT&T's old monopoly standing and
the new competitive realities, analysts say.
   The company has also eased off from its ``not-invented-here''
syndrome, showing a willingness to team up with outside companies
such as Ing. C. Olivetti SpA, Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem
Computers Inc.
   ``I don't know if you want to say Olson made order out of chaos,
but under his direction the company has got a much stronger vision
of who they are and where they want to go,'' said Peter Bernstein,
senior analyst at Probe Research Inc. in Cedar Knolls, N.J.
   Some of the problems AT&T will have to face with Olson gone:
   _Morale, though somewhat improved, still leaves room for
improvement, AT&T's own surveys have found.
   _The computer business continues to lose money and may not
become profitable until 1990. Some analysts say the company needs
to buy an established computer maker.
   _Shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterly
dividend, which has been stuck at $1.20 a share since the breakup.
   _AT&T still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the United States
and is having a hard time cracking foreign markets, a goal of the
company since the early 1980s.
   Allen, the man most likely to face the challenges, is a career
employee who worked his way up through telephone operating
companies in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Illinois and the mid-Atlantic
region. In contrast to Olson, his specialty is in finance.
   Allen was named president and chief operating officer in 1986.
Before that he was chairman and chief executive of the Information
Systems division. Prior to that he was AT&T's executive in charge
of corporate administration and finance.
   In a sign of Allen's standing, he shared the spotlight with
Olson in the introduction to the company's latest annual report,
which featured a question-and-answer session with the two
executives.
   Analysts differed on how significant Olson's loss will be.
   ``AT&T lost a key leader. (Allen has) got to measure up greater
than Olson, and that's going to be a tough road to travel,'' Holmes
said.
   But Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said: ``He
(Olson) will be missed, but from a practical, business point of
view, AT&T will not miss a beat.
   ``Bob Allen is less direct than Jim (Olson), but he is very
tough-minded,'' Grubman said.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Fed Decision On Bank Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday upheld the
Federal Reserve Board's conditional approval of the Bank of New
York Co.'s $1 billion-plus hostile offer for Irving Bank Corp.
   In a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals concluded that ``substantial evidence supports the
board's determination that the acquision complies with the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956.''
   The court rejected a petition by Irving that challenged the
decision-making procedure used by the Fed in approving the bid two
months ago.
   Bank of New York's tender offer, which began last month after
regulatory approval, is for $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common
shares for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 common shares outstanding.
Bank of New York, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, also
is running a slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board of directors.
   Monday's court decision came as Irving announced it has agreed
to sell a majority stake of the company to Banca Commerciale
Italiana, Italy's second largest bank, for $65 a share in cash, as
an alternative to Bank of New York Co.'s hostile bid.
   Irving also announced a complex restructuring plan that includes
the sale of its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, a sharp
immediate rise in annual shareholder dividends and a cost-cutting
program.

<HEAD>Pound at Six-Year High Against Dollar; Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British pound advanced again Monday, hiting
a six-year high against the dollar as an outbreak of fighting in
the Persian Gulf heightened the importance of the North Sea oil
fields.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $458.75 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$455.25 late Friday.
   The pound began gaining ground in London and continued its
advance in New York, moving firmly beyond the $1.90 level against
the dollar.
   While the pound had touched this level recently, it had not
finished that high 1982, said John McCarthy, vice president for
foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co.
   The sharp move in the pound prompted the Federal Reserve to
enter the market to sell pounds and buy dollars, said Ian Spence,
chief dealer at Manufactuers Hanover Trust Co.
   Traders said the pound was boosted by fresh tension in the
Persian Gulf, where U.S. forces destroyed two Iranian platforms in
retaliation for an Iranian mine attack that damaged a U.S. frigate
on patrol in international waters.
   ``People are focusing on the fact that there may be a boost in
oil prices, and that will benefit Great Britain because of its
North Sea oil fields,'' Spence said.
   The pound has come to be regarded recently as a
``petrocurrency,'' and any potential boost in oil prices would
support the currency.
   In London, the pound traded at $1.9015, more expensive than
Friday's $1.8890. In New York it cost $1.9050 to buy one pound,
more expensive than Friday's $1.9004. Traders said the pound was
slightly stronger against other major currencies.
   The dollar finished mixed against other currencies, but its
overall tone was relatively stable. Traders said the Persian Gulf
activity offered nominal support for the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.35 yen to close at 123.78. But later in
London, it rose to 124.42 yen from Friday's close of 124.13. In New
York, the dollar rose to 124.23 yen from 123.80 on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York included: 1.65975 West
German marks, down from 1.66095; 1.3735 Swiss francs, up from
1.3725; 5.6370 French francs, up form 5.6345; 1,233.375 Italian
lire, up from 1,232.625, and 1.23205 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2333.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates,
included: 1.6615 West German marks, up from 1.6605; 1.3745 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3720; 5.6410 French francs, up from 5.6325;
1.8630 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,234.37 Italian lire, up from
1,232.50, and 1.2322 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2335.
   Gold prices jumped higher. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold closed at $459.40 a troy ounce, up from $455.90 on Friday.
   In London, gold traded at $459.25 a troy ounce late Monday,
higher than Friday's late bid of $456.25. In Zurich, the bid price
was $458.50, up from $455.50 late Friday, when the market closed at
midday for a holiday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.03 to close at a bid $457.98.
   Silver was quoted on New York's Comex at $6.422 a troy ounce,
down from $6.455 on Friday. In London, the metal traded at a bid
price of $6.49 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday bid price.

<HEAD>Manville Reports First-Quarter Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. on Monday reported its first
quarter net income fell by 16.6 percent from the year-earlier
period, which had been boosted by one-time gains.
   The Denver-based building products company said its first
quarter profit was $35.7 million, or $1.23 per share, down from
$42.8 million, or $1.52 per share, in the first quarter of 1987.
   First quarter 1987 results included $9 million in gains from the
sale of two real estate ventures.
   Sales in the quarter ended March 31 rose to $502.1 million from
$475 million in the same period a year ago, the company said.
   ``Despite severe competition in most construction segments,
Manville's overall performance continues to be strong,'' said Tom
Stephens, Manville's president and chief executive officer.
   He attributed Manville's first quarter results to the
performance of the forest products division and the effects of
stronger international currencies.
   ``Excluding the non-recurring gain on the sale of our real
estate holdings, 1988's operating performance was higher than the
record first quarter of 1987,'' Stephens said.
   Manville filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy act on Aug. 26, 1982, because it was faced with
billions of dollars worth of lawsuits claiming damage from exposure
to asbestos made by Manville.
   The federal bankruptcy court approved the company's
reorganization plan in December 1986, but the plan cannot be
implemented until all appeals by claimants are addressed.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Surge on Persian Gulf Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rose Monday on expectations that an outbreak
of fighting in the Persian Gulf could drive oil prices and
inflation higher, but analysts were skeptical about the chances for
a sustained rally.
   On other markets, energy futures advanced; most livestock and
meat futures declined; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
stock-index futures rose.
   Gold for June delivery settled above $460 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange in New York for the first time this month. But
the settlement price of $461.70 was well below the day's high of
$464, an 11-week high.
   Silver and platinum also jumped in early trading, but an
afternoon selloff pushed their settlement prices below Friday's
final prices.
   The prospect that military action between the United States and
Iran in the Persian Gulf could disrupt crude-oil shipments and
drive oil prices higher was seen as a positive factor for the
inflation-sensitive metals, analysts said.
   But brief skirmishes such as Monday's U.S. Navy attacks on
Iranian oil platforms and military vessels often have an ultimately
negative impact on the precious metals, said Craig Sloane, metals
analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``You get a knee-jerk response that's very quick in terms of
people rushing in and buying the metals,'' he said. ``But once you
reach the point where the buying can't sustain itself, the sellers
come in and it ends up being more damaging to the metals prices
than being positive.''
   Gold settled $3.20 to $3.80 higher, with the contract for
delivery in June at $461.70 a troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to
3.5 cents lower, with May at $6.44 a troy ounce.
   Crude-oil futures also fell back on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after a morning rally that pushed the contract for May
delivery to $18.92, just short of the important $19-a-barrel level.
   ``The market clearly reacted to the increased tension in the
Persian Gulf and the U.S.-Iran clash,'' said Andrew Lebow, an
analyst in New York with ED&F Man International Futures Inc.
   The setback apparently was motivated partly by technical factors
and partly by statements from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that they
would not reduce their production of crude oil unless non-OPEC
producers also agreed to cut production, Lebow said.
   OPEC has invited some non-OPEC producers to meet next week to
discuss production levels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 26 cents
higher, with contracts for May delivery at $18.52 a barrel. Heating
oil was .48 cent to .83 cent higher, with May at 50.50 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .64 cent to .73 cent higher with May
at 53.30 cents a gallon.
   Cattle and pork futures were pressured by profit-taking on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures advanced above recent highs early in the session,
sold off on profit-taking, then recovered to finish only slightly
lower than Friday's final prices.
   Hog futures ran into some technical weakness late in the day,
analysts said. On the fundamental side, weights of slaughtered
animals have been relatively high and the market is still awaiting
a seasonal drop in supplies.
   ``I think there is this perception that near-term supplies won't
give you much to be optimistic about,'' said Philip Stanley, an
analyst in Chicago for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Live cattle were .77 cent lower to .13 cent higher, with April
contracts at 74.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to
.60 cent lower, with April at 79.07 cents a pound; hogs were .50
cent lower to .10 cent higher, with April at 44.80 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .40 cent lower to .35 cent higher, with
May at 51.65 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices closed substantially higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Corn also advanced, while wheat futures
declined slightly.
   The soybean market showed its underlying strength by rallying
despite fairly heavy selling early in the session by speculative
funds, analysts said.
   ``We're in a bull market and the market just doesn't want to go
down,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Wheat was pressured by speculative selling and reports of
beneficial weekend rains in southern wheat-growing states, he said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher, with May
contracts at $3.11\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1} cents higher,
with May at $2.03} a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 4} cents higher,
with May at $1.64} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 7 cents
higher, with May at $6.66 a bushel.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled .45 point higher at 259.25.

   Stocks weakened Monday on fears about inflation
and U.S.-Iranian shootouts in the Persian Gulf, although the market
recovered much of the loss in the late afternoon and ended the day
mixed.
   Volume remained light however, suggesting most of the trading
was done between professional brokerages. Many analysts said a
broad range of investors remained reluctant to get into stocks.
   ``I don't see any institutional rush to buy them,'' said Robert
O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``Nobody on the face of this earth can tell which way
this market's going for the rest of the week.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, still wobbly from a big
drop last week because of an unexpected jump in the trade deficit,
was down about 12 points through much of the session but held just
above the 2,000 level.
   The widely watched barometer closed at 2,008.12, down 5.81
points. Most broader indices of stock values fell slightly.
   ``Traders were trading with each other,'' said William King,
head trader at Nikko Securities Co. International in New York.
``Otherwise, it's really been a sleepy day.''
   Escalating violence between Iranian and American forces in the
Persian Gulf indirectly influenced Wall Street by pushing up oil
prices, which aggravated pre-existing fears of higher inflation and
rising interest rates.
   The impact was first felt in the bond market, where yields on
some 30-year issues surpassed the 9 percent barrier, the highest
levels in three months. This made bonds more attractive to many
investors and raised the prospect that stocks could suffer sharp
declines if bond yields continue to rise.
   Gaining and losing issues were about even on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 771 up, 765 down and 460 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 144.65 million shares, sharply lower than the 234.16
million shares traded in the previous session.
   Speculative takeover-related buying helped boost some stocks.
Rumors surfaced that the Haft family of Maryland was preparing an
offer for retailing giant F.W. Woolworth & Co., which rose 2 to 55.
   Armtek rose 2 to 30[ after Italy's Pirelli group agreed to buy
Armtek's Armstrong tire unit for $190 million in cash. Facet rose
3{ to 31] after Pennzoil agreed to buy the company for $32 a share,
topping a rival bid from Prospect Group.
   Oil stocks were mixed despite a runup in petroleum prices
incited by the Persian Gulf fighting. Amoco rose ~ to 78], Atlantic
Richfield fell ~ to 87{, Chevron fell { to 47| and Kerr McGee rose
{ to 37[.
   American Telephone & Telegraph fell \ to 26]. The company said
its chairman James E. Olson died after a monthlong battle with
cancer.
   Among other notable blue chips, Merck fell 2[ to 157}, Bethlehem
Steel rose 1 to 21, General Electric fell { to 39{ and DuPont rose
2\ to 84].
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 167.77 million shares.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of
5,000 NYSE, American and over-the-counter issues, totaled $2.587
trillion, off $3.49 billion from Friday.
   The NYSE index of all listed issues fell 0.23 to 146.77.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.63 to 302.05,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.56 to 259.21.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.68
to 300.92. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 375.10, up 1.20.

   Motorola Inc. unveiled a new line of
microprocessor chips on Monday that use a simplified set of
commands for extra speed and introduced 10 companies that will use
the line.
   The 88000 line of microprocessors is Motorola's entry into a
battle with Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Sun
Microsystems Inc. and other companies that make or design the tiny
chips that serve as the ``brains'' of personal computers and work
stations.
   Among the companies that said they will use the 88000 in future
products were Data General Corp., Northern Telecom Inc., Convergent
Technologies and Tektronix Inc.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said its chip was up to
five times as powerful as other chips based on the stripped-down
principles of Risc, an acronym for reduced instruction set computer.
   The company said it will work with Data General on developing a
version of the 88000 that uses a design called emitter-coupled
logic for extra speed. The version will allow performance of up to
100 million instructions per second by 1991, they said.

   Here are highlights from the report by the
President's Commission on Aviation Safety:
   _ The nation's air transportation system is ``safe, for now,''
but the government regulatory structure ``designed to ensure
aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and
technological change.''
   _ There is a need for ``a major structural overhaul'' of the
Federal Aviation Administration, making it an independent agency
outside the Transportation Department.
   _ An independent aviation ``safety czar'' should be appointed as
part of the new FAA and given authority to oversee safety matters.
With a seven-year term, the new aviation safety director could
initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations.
   _ No need has been demonstrated for re-imposing federal
regulation of the airline industry, although the government must
streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing
events in a deregulated industry.
   _ Surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier
reliance on in-depth inspections, surprise inspections and closer
examination of airlines undergoing major changes.
   _ Safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated
gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines.
   _ Small private planes flying near major airports should be
required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their
altitude.

   U.S. negotiators suggested to Soviet officials
Monday that the two nations might consider a ban on all fishing in
a section of the Bering Sea known as the ``doughnut hole'' while
scientists try to determine whether it is being overfished.
   ``We are moving, going through the hoops and everything has come
up that we wanted,'' said Edward Wolfe, the State Department's
ambassador for oceans and fisheries who is heading the U.S.
negotiating team.
   Wolfe said U.S. officials discussed with the Soviets the
possibility of either a permanent or temporary moratorium on
fishing by foreign trawlers in the ``doughnut hole,'' one of the
richest fishing grounds in the world.
   In addition, the negotiators will take a look at whether the
United States and the Soviet Union could enforce such a ban under
international law or if efforts should be made to include other
countries in imposing a fishing moratorium.
   ``It's going pretty much according to script and we are just
laying everything out,'' said Wolfe.
   Wolfe said he couldn't comment on the Soviets' reaction to the
U.S. suggestions. Officials in the fisheries department at the
Soviet embassy were unavilable for comment.
   About 20 U.S. negotiators, including representatives of the
departments of State, Commerce and Defense and the Coast Guard,
attended the first day of talks while the Soviets were represented
by about six officials.
   The catch by foreign vessels in the 4,500-square mile ``doughnut
hole'' roughly in the center of the Bering Sea has risen from about
200,000 metric tons in 1984 to over 1 million metric tons in 1987.
   Last month, Wolfe told a Senate committee that besides bottom
fish, there are indications that the foreign fleet may be catching
salmon and herring in the area.
   The Senate earlier this year overwhelmingly approved a
resolution calling on the State Department to negotiate a fishing
moratorium in the Bering Sea.
   U.S. scientists are concerned that overfishing in the ``doughnut
hole'' may eventually affect the catch in American waters. Wolfe
said the Soviets share those concerns.
   Representatives of the U.S. fishing industry and the Coast Guard
also suspect that foreign vessels use the ``doughnut hole'' as a
staging ground for illegal forays into the 200-mile American
economic zone.
   In January, American fishermen chartered a plane and videotaped
seven foreign trawlers which they said were illegally fishing 38
miles inside the U.S. economic zone off Alaska. The videotapes
prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to
levy $100,000 in fines against three Japanese companies.
   While the governments of Japan, China, South Korea and Poland
were not invited to participate in the U.S.-Soviet talks, Wolfe
said he would sit down with them later to see if a multilateral
accord was possible.
   Soviet and American waters surround the ``doughnut hole'' and it
is not possible for foreign vessels to enter the area without
passing through the U.S. and Soviet economic zones.

   The cars under the recall order are model 1983 and early 1984
Volvo DL and GL models that have 2.3 liter, 4 cylinder

<HEAD>Farmers' Share Of Food Dollar Continues Decline In 1987</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers continued to get a declining share of
the consumer food dollar in 1987, an Agriculture Department report
said Monday.
   A selected market basket of grocery items used by economists to
track price changes for food commodities showed that farmers
received an equivalent of 29 cents for each dollar spent by
consumers on those items.
   The farm value share of the retail price of food in the market
basket has declined one percentage point _ a penny of each dollar
spent _ since it averaged 34 percent, or 34 cents, in the 1984
calendar year.
   According to USDA records going back to 1913, when farmers got
46 percent of the food dollar, the annual share has been at record
low levels the last three years _ 31 percent in 1985, 30 percent in
1986 and 29 percent in 1987.
   Previously, the low mark was a farm value share of 32 percent
during 1932 and 1933 in the depths of the Depression. It rose to
more than 50 percent during World War II and for a few years after.
   With 29 percent of the retail cost of market basket going to
farmers, that means the remaining 71 percent went to those who
handle raw food products after they leave the farm.
   The market basket contains average quantities of domestically
produced food bought in grocery stores, excluding non-alcoholic
beverages, and fish and seafood.

   Allegheny International Inc. said Monday that
improved performance in its consumer products division helped stem
its losses in the second quarter to $4.5 million, compared with a
loss of $38.5 million in the same period a year ago.
   The Pittsburgh-based firm said record sales in its barbecue
grill and lawn and patio furniture lines coupled with strong
performance in its Latin American businesses contributed to the
improvements.
   Allegheny International reported quarterly sales of $254.7
million, up from $225.1 million in the year-ago period. Operating
earnings reached $19 million from $15 million.
   For the first six months, Allegheny International reported net
earnings of $2.7 million on sales of $511 million. That compares
with a net loss of $204.2 million on sales of $447.7 million for
the first six months of 1987.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Oliver S. Travers said
customers and vendors have given ``excellent support'' during the
company's reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy
code, so ``we are focusing our primary attention on the financial
restructuring of the company.''
   Allegheny International manufactures and markets small household
appliances, electric blankets, lawn and patio furniture and
barbecue grills, many of which are sold under the Sunbeam and Oster
brand names.

   Pennzoil Co. on Monday announced plans to pay
$250 million in cash for an oil field equipment company, but said
the purchase had nothing to do with the $3 billion it recently
received to settle its four-year legal battle with Texaco Inc.
   Under the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the board
of directors of Facet Enterprises Inc., a cash tender offer of $32
per share by a newly created Pennzoil subsidiary will commence as
soon as practicable, Pennzoil spokesman Robert Harper said.
   Tulsa, Okla.-based Facet had been fighting off an unfriendly
takeover attempt by the Prospect Group Inc., which extended its
latest offer of $27.50 per share through 5 p.m. EDT Thursday. Facet
had rejected two tender offers from the New York-based company.
   Pennzoil informed Facet that it has on hand sufficient cash to
complete the transaction and that there were no financing
conditions to the tender offer and merger.
   ``We believe Facet's management is a vital resource and a
crucial part of this transaction,'' said Randal B. McDonald,
Pennzoil's president and chief operating officer.
   ``We are hopeful the present management will continue in their
positions.''
   Facet manufactures and markets filters under the Purolator brand
name and for the private label market. It also manufactures and
markets transportation components, filters and filtration systems
and oil field production equipment.
   Pennzoil intends to operate Facet as a separate entity and keep
its headquarters in Tulsa, McDonald said.
   ``We are delighted that our efforts to maximize stockholders'
investment in Facet have resulted in an agreement which provides a
fair price for their shares,'' said James Malone, president and
chief executive officer of Facet.
   ``In addition, we are confident that a combination with a
company having the stature and financial resources of Pennzoil will
be beneficial to our employees, suppliers, customers and
community.''
   The acquisition of Facet is on the heels of a $3 billion payment
from Texaco that ended their courtroom battles over Getty Oil Co.
   But Harper said the company had cash available for the
acquisition before the settlement with Texaco.
   ``We had been looking at this possibility for a number of weeks,
prior to the settlement,'' Harper said. ``I really don't think that
you can put those two things together.''
   Earlier this month, Texaco agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion to
end the litigation and to allow the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil
giant to emerge from nearly a year under federal bankruptcy court
protection.
   After the money was transferred into Houston-based Pennzoil's
bank account, Pennzoil executives said they hadn't decided on
long-term plans for the sum.
   ``We're going to look and have been looking for some time'' at
ways to invest the money, Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke said.
   Warren Shimmerlik, an industry analyst at the New York office of
Merrill Lynch, said Facet appeared to be a logical fit for Pennzoil.
   ``It's a distribution and you can add something to it. You can
add some value and eliminate a lot of cost and apparently that is
what appeals to Pennzoil,'' he said.
   Shimmerlik and Charles Andrew of the New York investment firm of
John S. Herold & Co. each said they were not sure if there was any
link to the Texaco payment.
   ``This is so small, relative to the magnitude to the money they
got. I don't know if I'd call it the beginning of a spree,'' said
Andrew.
   ``Pennzoil states that by reinvesting the money they got from
Texaco into oil and gas properties, they can postpone any payment
in taxes. I don't think this (the Facet merger) would qualify, so
it may be this is not related to the money from Texaco,'' Andrew
said.
   In November 1985, a Houston jury shocked Texaco by agreeing that
Texaco had wrongfully interferred in a planned Pennzoil-Getty
merger and awarded Pennzoil $10.53 billion in damages _ the largest
civil award in U.S. history.
   Texaco appealed. A state appeals court upheld the verdict, but
reduced the $3 billion in punitive damages to $1 billion.
   On April 12, 1987, Texaco filed for bankruptcy protection,
saying it had to do so to avoid posting a potentially runious bond
to continue its appeal of the judgment.

<HEAD>Chase Manhattan Reports 164 Percent Increase in First-Quarter Net</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's largest bank holding companies _ Chase
Manhattan Corp. and Continental Illinois Corp. _ on Monday reported
a sharp increase in their first-quater profits.
   Meanwhile, Great Western Financial Corp., based in Beverly
Hills, Calif., and the nation's second-largest savings and loan
association, said its first-quarter earnings fell 37 percent.
   Chase, the nation's second largest banking company, said net
income totaled $277 million, or $3.09 a share, up 166 percent from
$104 million, or $1.12 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Continental Illinois, ranked 15th, said it netted $68.5 million,
or 28 cents a share, up 59 percent from earnings of $43.1 million,
or 16 cents a share, in 1987.
   Great Western reported first-quarter earnings of $56.1 million,
or 45 cents a share, down from restated 1987 first-quarter earnings
of $89.4 million, or 71 cents a share.
   Chase said its net income was boosted by the sale of its
securities information subisidiary Interactive Data Corp., the sale
of a branch office building in Paris and federal income-tax
benefits.
   Excluding these items, net income for the quarter would have
been $116 million.
   Total assets during the quarter averaged $95.7 billion, compared
with $97 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Chase's sale of its
subsidiary Nederlandse Credietbank N.V. on Dec. 31, 1987, reduced
1987 year-end total assets by about $4 billion.
   The provision for possible credit losses was $150 million during
the quarter, down from $160 million in the year-earlier quarter.
Chase said the continuing non-accrual status of loans to Brazil and
Ecuador reduced first-quarter net interest income by $53 million.
   Net interest income during the quarter amounted to $732 million,
up from $721 million in the year-earlier quarter. Total interest
expense was $1.46 billion, up from $1.26 billion.
   Other operating income for the quarter was $633 million, up from
$426 million in the year-earlier period. Operating expenses
amounted to $856 million, up from $840 million in the first quarter
of last year.
   Chase noted that a strong performance by its foreign-exchange
trading operation and increased fees and commissions were partially
offset by a decline in gains from the sales of investment
securities.
   Continental Illinois attributed its increase in earnings partly
to the settlement of a portion of Continental's pension-plan
obligation.
   By purchasing an annuity for a portion of that obligation,
Continental was able to realize gains on pension assets that had
appreciated, said company spokeswoman Holly Anderson.
   Continental said the remainder of first-quarter income resulted
from improved performance in the core businesses _ lending, fees
and trading _ of the holding company's Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co.
   Continental said total revenue _ the sum of net interest revenue
plus fees, trading and other sources _ rose 13 percent to $275.7
million from $244.3 million a year ago.
   The comany said it lowered its provision for loan losses to
$10.4 million from $13.5 million last year.
   Great Western said its provision for loan losses was $19.5
million, down from $23 million. Total new loans increased to $2.3
billion from $2.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter, it said.
   Net interest income amounted to $201 million, down from $216
million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense amounted to
$485 million, up from $427 million.

   Apple Computer Inc. said Monday its profit jumped 135 percent in
its latest fiscal quarter on a 51 percent rise in revenue, leading
a list of computer makers that announced improved results.
   Among other companies, profit was up 20 percent at NCR Corp. and
27 percent at Tandy Corp.
   Apple said it had an after-tax profit of $79.7 million, or 61
cents a share, in its second fiscal quarter ended April 1, up from
$33.9 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$867.2 million from $575.3 million.
   It was the third consecutive quarter that Apple, based in
Cupertino, Calif., had sales increases of more than 50 percent.
   ``Apple is succeeding in business markets,'' said Delbert W.
Yocam, Apple's chief operating officer. ``Acceptance for Macintosh
products continues to increase on a worldwide basis.''
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Apple said its
profit rose 21.8 percent to $201 million, or $1.53 a share, from
$92.3 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
15.4 percent to $1.91 billion from $1.24 billion.
   NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, said its net profit rose to $74.1
million, or 88 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31,
compared with earnings of $61.5 million, or 65 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 14 percent to $1.28 billion from $1.12
billion.
   Domestic orders declined, compared to the first quarter of 1987,
but foreign orders showed a strong gain, propelled partly by the
advantage of a cheaper dollar, NCR said.
   Tandy, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said its profit rose to $64.1
million, or 72 cents a share, in its third fiscal quarter ended
March 31, from $50.4 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 8 percent to $839.1 million from $776.9 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Tandy's profit
rose 31 percent to $259.1 million, or $2.89 a share, from $197.9
million, or $2.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent
to $2.98 billion from $2.72 billion.

<HEAD>Shop-by TV Retailer Sues Drexel Over Eurobond Issue Terms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBs 4th graf pvs Two telephone... to UPDATE Drexel comment.
Picks up 5th graf, HSN action...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Home Shopping Network Inc. sued Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. on Monday, accusing the investment firm of fraud in
connection with its sale of $100 million in HSN convertible bonds
to European investors last year.
   The shop-by-television retailer said in a suit filed in U.S.
District Court in Tampa, Fla., that Drexel fraudulently induced
Home Shopping to allow a new conversion price to be set for
swapping the bonds for HSN stock.
   The suit also accused Drexel and the head of its high-yield
investment bond group, Michael Milken, of secretly funneling the
securities to its regular network of ``junk bond'' buyers and then
acting in conjunction with the network to manipulate the HSN stock
price downward during the 30-day period for setting the new
conversion price.
   A Drexel spokesman, Steve Anreder, said the firm had not yet
seen the lawsuit but ``it sounds like Home Shopping Network is
unhappy with the market performance of its securities, over which
we have no control.''
   HSN's action comes against a background of a broad government
inquiry into Drexel's operations that arose partly because of the
firm's reported past business links with speculator and
insider-trader Ivan F. Boesky, now serving a three-year prison term
for securities fraud.
   Drexel has denied any improper activities and hasn't been
charged with any wrongdoing.
   The HSN suit asked for invalidation of the price-reset provision
in the bond sale and requested unspecified monetary damages for
securities fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and other violations.
   HSN Chairman Roy Speer said that in addition to the lawsuit, the
company filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange
Commission against Drexel and Milken charging them with
manipulating HSN's stock.
   When the bonds were sold last April, they carried an original
conversion price of $25.80 per share. At that price, the company
would have had to issue about 3.9 million shares of stock to redeem
all the bonds.
   But HSN said that after the bond offering was closed, it agreed
at Drexel's request to include a provision to allow a new
conversion price to be set at the 30-day average of HSN's share
price prior to the April 22 conversion date plus a 20 percent
premium.
   At the time of the bond issue, HSN was trading at about $18 a
share on the American Stock Exchange, said Nando Di Filippo, HSN
executive vice president. He said the stock had fallen to about $8
a share when the reset period started on March 10 and has fallen as
low as $4.87{ a share since then.
   Although the reset period does not expire until Thursday, Di
Filippo said it appears the conversion price will be about $6.50,
which he said could result in the issuance of up to about 14
million shares of stock.
   That amount would not mean a change in control of the video
retailer, but it would dilute the value of the company's
outstanding stock, he said.
   Home Shopping, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., operates two
television networks that offer items ranging from electronics
equipment to jewelry for sale to viewers who call while the items
are displayed.
   For the year ended Aug. 31, 1987, the company reported a profit
of $29.5 million, or 33 cents per share, on sales of $582.1 million.

<HEAD>Airline Ordered to Pay $10.5 Million to Film Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines Inc. was ordered Monday to pay
$10.5 million in damages to a New York film company that won a
federal court breach of contract suit against the airline.
   Attorneys and a spokesman for American Airlines said the
Dallas-based airline would appeal the verdict.
   At issue was a contract between American and Robehr Films Inc.
calling for the airline to show short travelogue films along with
feature films on flights to New York, Honolulu, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Dallas and Chicago. The travelogues contained segments
by advertisers based in the six cities.
   Robehr Films sued American in U.S. District Court for breach of
contract and fraud, claiming American did not show the films and
knowingly reported false viewrship figures.
   Joseph Gorayeb, the attorney representing Robehr Films, said his
client was insolvent as a result of the airline's breach of
contract.
   American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., countersued for $500,000
it claimed it was owed.
   A jury found in favor of Robehr on the breach of contract
complaint and ordered American to pay $10.5 million in damages, but
found for the airline in the fraud complaint. The jury voted in
favor of Robehr in American's countersuit.
   Kenneth Steinthal, the attorney representing American Airlines,
said the the damage award was ``ludicrous'' and would be fought.
Steinthal said there was nothing in the record to support such a
high damage award, and nothing to indicate the plaintiff lost any
money.
   The airline will ask Judge Richard J. Daronco on April 28 to set
aside the verdict as being unsupported by evidence, Steinthal said.
   Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines in Dallas, said of
the ruling: ``We obviously will be filing the appropriate motion to
have the decision overturned, and we are confident of a favorable
ruling, ultimately.'' He declined further comment.

<HEAD>Kraft Net Income Earnings Down 22 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc. reported Monday that its first
quarter net income declined by 22 percent from a year earlier,
although profit in the year-earlier period was boosted sharply by a
one-time accounting change.
   The multinational food company posted first-quarter net income
of $118.3 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with $151.6
million, or $1.11 per share, a year ago.
   The year-earlier quarter included a $45.2 million gain resulting
from a change in accounting methods. Excluding the impact of the
change, Kraft's first quarter 1987 profit then would have been
$106.4 million, or 78 cents a share.
   Profit from continuing operations rose by 14 percent, the
company said.
   First quarter sales rose to nearly $2.9 billion from about $2.5
billion last year, the company stated.
   Sales within Kraft's largest division, the U.S. Consumer Food
group, increased 9 percent to $1.2 billion.
   Kraft also reported sales gains in its cheese, dairy, frozen
foods, commercial foods, food service, food ingredients and
international foods operations. Sales in the grocery products
divison were essentially unchanged.
   Kraft Chairman John M. Richman said Kraft's results benefited
from a lower tax rate, productivity improvements and a share
repurchase program that had reduced the company's common shares
outstanding by 4 percent as of March 26.
