<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's temperature remained high, but
no further bleeding was reported Wednesday morning, the 17th day
since the 87-year-old monarch fell seriously ill.
   He has been bedridden since internal hemorrhaging caused him to
vomit blood Sept. 19 and has continued intermittently to discharge
an unspecified amount of blood.
   Kenji Maeda, head of general affairs division of the Imperial
Household Agency, told reporters in the latest report that the
emperor ``had no discharge of blood and remained in stable
condition.''
   He said the monarch's temperature was 98.96 Wednesday morning,
compared with 100 Tuesday evening. The reading was still
considerably higher than his normal reading of 95.9.
   His heir and other royal relatives visited Hirohito on Tuesday,
the man who has reigned longer than any other living monarch.
   Palace officials said Hirohito watched a 15-minute television
drama Tuesday afternoon.
   Relatives said he talked about the Olympic Games, which just
ended in South Korea.
   Some reports have said Hirohito has intestinal cancer. Palace
officials neither confirmed nor denied the reports and have asked
journalists not to speculate.
   Other reports say he also has acute jaundice and a
malfunctioning kidney.
   Since his condition worsened two weeks ago, Hirohito has been
unable to take food or liquids except for two small ice cubes and a
few spoonfuls of porridge.
   Among those visiting him Tuesday were Crown Prince Akihito,
Crown Princess Michiko and their children Prince Hiro, Prince Aya
and Princess Nori.
   Akihito, 54, has assumed his father's duties, which are largely
ceremonial.

<HEAD>Containment Projected On Friday For Clover-Mist Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After months of
firefighting with no end in sight, officials said Tuesday there was
only one fire burning in and around Yellowstone National Park and
it could be contained in three days.
   As of Tuesday, the 387,400-acre Clover-Mist fire was 90 percent
contained, and the 845 firefighters left on the blaze expected to
have it contained on Friday, according to park spokeswoman Sandi
Robinson.
   The fire, which also covers parts of the Shoshone National
Forest and into Montana, has been burning since July 9, one of
several that have involved an area covering 1.6 million acres in
and around the park.
   At one time the Clover-Mist blaze threw up 100-foot walls of
flame that dwarfed firefighters trying to get containment lines
around its perimeter.
   As the summer waned, however, activity has slowed so much fire
crews have gotten down to ``cold trailing,'' in which they feel the
ground with their bare hands in search of hot spots that have yet
even to produce smoke.
   Progress also is being made on the 400,100-acre North Fork and
the 107,500-acre Wolf Lake fires in Yellowstone and fire crews
continue to head out of the country's oldest national park.
   However, it is too soon to predict when nature will be allowed
to take over the job of handling the fires, Robinson said.
   ``We continue to demobilize, but as far as when the last
firefighter will leave the park we just don't know that yet,'' she
said.

Picks up 7th graf pvs, His release ... with minor editing to

<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian professor Mithileshwar
Singh, freed after 20 months as a hostage in Lebanon, flew into
Frankfurt from Syria Wednesday and was assisted by the crew as he
left the U.S. Air Force transport plane.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, Singh told reporters Tuesday
that his kidnappers treated him well but said ``there is no
substitute for freedom'' and he grieves for those still held.
   Singh, a 60-year-old resident alien of the United States who was
released on Monday, walked slowly as he left the C-141 Starlifter.
   He made no comments to about 70 journalists standing nearby, but
waved several times.
   Singh then climbed into the back seat of a waiting car that
drove away from the airport. Air Force Lt. William Dillingham said
Singh was taken to a U.S. military hospital in Wiesbaden, 24 miles
west of Frankfurt.
   Singh and three American colleagues were kidnapped in Beirut in
January 1987.
   Singh arrived in Frankfurt from Damascus at 2:20 a.m. Wednesday
(9:20 p.m. EDT Tuesday) at the Air Force's Rhein-Main Base.
   Craig Springer, spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt,
told reporters at the base that Singh would undergo a medical
checkup and then a State Department debriefing team was scheduled
to interview him later Wednesday.
   ``This is a two-fold operation. No. 1 is to insure the physical
and mental health of Mr. Singh, but at the same time to find out
about other contacts he may have had,'' Springer said.
   His release leaves nine Americans and seven other foreigners
still missing in Lebanon and believed held by extremist Moslem
kidnappers. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Lalmani Singh was reunited Tuesday with her husband at the U.S.
Embassy in Damascus. Mrs. Singh did not go with him to West
Germany, but said she expects to join her husband ``very soon.''
   Singh was freed Monday night in Beirut and driven to Damascus by
Syrian army officers, then turned over to U.S. Ambassador Edward
Djerejian.
   Djerejian, Indian Charge d'Affaires B. Balakrishnan and Syrian
officials saw Singh off at the Damascus airport.
   Djerejian said Singh asked to be allowed to rest, and ``given
the circumstances, he is feeling relatively well.''
   A Syrian doctor pronounced Singh fit for travel.
   In New Delhi, the Foreign Ministry said India had worked for
Singh's release through contacts ``with the Syrian goverment'' and
others.
   The captive was released to the U.S. ambassador ``because of the
confusion that still existed'' in the Middle East about his
nationality, a spokesman said.
   India has maintained Singh was kidnapped because his abductors
thought he was an American.
   Armed men dressed as policemen took Singh hostage Jan. 24, 1987,
on the Beirut University College campus in Moslem west Beirut,
along with Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility, and said it freed Singh as a
goodwill gesture to the United States. Nearly all the foreign
hostages in Lebanon are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal
to Iran.
   A U.S. official in Damascus said the Americans decided to accept
custody because Singh had applied for citizenship before his
abduction.
   Singh said Tuesday he felt ``wonderful'' and added: ``Thank God
I'm free, but I'm very sorry that my colleagues and friends are
still in captivity. I hope they'll be free soon.''
   He was clean-shaven, dressed in a gray suit, and appeared before
dozens of reporters at the Syrian Foreign Ministry after a brief
chat with Djerejian. He was brought in through a back door at about
11 a.m.
   Steen, Polhill and Turner were the only hostages he saw while in
captivity, Singh said.
   Asked about the conditions under which he was held, he said:
``The treatment was better than I had expected, but there's no
substitute to freedom in this world.''
   His captors provided medicine for his chronic diabetes, Singh
said, but he appeared hesistant about discussing details of his
captivity.
   After a few questions, he said: ``Please. I'm very tired now. .
.. Respect my feeling of freedom.''
   Singh said the four captives ``lived together, but I did not see
anyone else.'' He was a professor of finance at BUC; Steen, 49, of
Boston, taught journalism; Polhill, 54, of New York City, was a
lecturer in accounting, and Turner, 41, of Boise, Idaho, was an
instructor of mathematics and computer science.
   In Washington, President Reagan again ruled out negotiations
with captors of the Americans but said liberating them ``has been a
great problem for us and it's very much on our minds.''
   The White House said pleasure about Singh's release was
``tempered by the knowledge that nine innocent Americans'' still
are hostages.
   In an interview published Tuesday in The New York Times, the
spiritual leader of a group believed to be an umbrella for captors
of foreign hostages was quoted as saying this is ``not yet the
right time for the American hostages to be freed.''
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also was quoted as
saying the hostages ``would have to wait for the outcome of the
American presidential election.'' He said Iran prefers to deal with
the Republicans.

<HEAD>Bull Moose On The Loose In Boston Suburbs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 500-pound bull moose has been lumbering
across busy highways and wandering through wooded areas in Boston's
western suburbs, and authorities hope he finds his way back north
on his own.
   ``Where does a 500-pound gorrilla sleep? Anywhere he likes.
That's sort of what we're doing with the moose,'' said Steve
Williams, a biologist for the state Department Fisheries and
Wildlife.
   ``We have moose come in occasionally and normally they cause no
problems, they either wander up back north or find a place to stay
for the fall.''
   ``Metro Moose'' was last spotted limping into the woods in
Weston after a car clipped his hind leg Monday morning. It has been
seen at least 10 times in five towns 10 to 15 miles west of Boston
during the past week.
   Animal control officers, police and state wildlife officials say
they can't do much for the moose _ believed to have wandered from
New Hampshire for mating season _ except try to keep people away
from him.
   Williams said each mating season older male moose chase younger
males away from the females.
   ``At this time of the year, the young males are kicked out of
the area and travel in search of mates and in search of new
territory,'' Williams said.
   And because there's moose populations to the north, west, and
east, they often head south.
   Susan Webb Harvey, the animal control officer in Wellesley, said
the moose has been spotted crossing Route 9 several times in the
early morning.
   ``He's been moving at night and probably sleeping during the
day, that's why people don't see him,'' she said. ``Of course at
night you can't see him unless he comes in front of your
headlights.''

<TEXT>
   Libya's foreign minister on Tuesday
repeated his country's demand for compensation from America for the
U.S. air raids in 1986 on Tripoli and Benghazi.
   Gadallah Azouz el-Talhy told the General Assembly, ``May I
remind you of the flagrant barbaric aggression perpetrated by the
United States of America in the spring of 1986.''
   ``This aggression was condemned by world public opinion at the
time and by this distinguished assembly ... which recognized the
right of our people to receive appropriate compensation for the
losses incurred,'' he said. He did not mention any specific amount.
   U.S. warplanes attacked the two Libyan cities on April 15, 1986,
after the Reagan administration accused the regime of Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi of supporting international terrorism.
   Libyan authorities said 41 people perished in the raids and the
attacks were aimed at killing Gadhafi. They denied the allegation
that Libya had supported terrorists.
   In November 1986, the General Assembly passed a resolution 79-28
condemning the raids. Libya then asked the Security Council for a
similar resolution, but America, Britain and France vetoed it.
   ``As the American attack against Libya is one of the items on
the (General Assembly) agenda this session, we call upon all
peace-loving states to reiterate their condemnation of this
aggression'' and to support Libya's demand for compensation,
el-Talhy told the assembly.

   Ms. Mann is the author of ``Tinsel Town.'' Her new book,
``Rumors,'' published by Delacorte, is scheduled to be released in
December.
   Grandy, who married Ms. Mann in March 1987, has two children

<HEAD>Bentsen, Quayle Head for Debate; Bush, Dukakis Spar Long-Distance</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS final three grafs with four grafs on new Bush ads,
Dukakis ad budget.
^By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</NOTE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice presidential nominees Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen polished
their debate lines Tuesday in preparation for their 90 minutes in
the campaign spotlight.
   At the top of the tickets, George Bush said he wanted to inspire
affluent youths ``to help our poor,'' while Michael Dukakis said
the GOP offers only ``slogans and symbols.''
   Republican Quayle and Democrat Bentsen were flying to Omaha,
Neb., the site of Wednesday night's debate.
   ``I will be prepared to answer any and all questions tomorrow
night ... ,'' Quayle said aboard his campaign plane to Omaha.
``This will be the first time since New Orleans that I will have an
opportunity to communicate with the American people in an unedited
version.''
   A new poll released Tuesday suggested that the debate would give
Quayle a chance to overcome some of the negative images about him
that are driving undecided voters away from Bush.
   The CBS News-New York Times poll of 1,034 probable voters found
48 percent support for the Bush-Quayle ticket and 46 percent for
the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. But when voters were asked about their
presidential preference only, the support for Dukakis slipped to 43
percent.
   The poll, conducted Saturday through Monday, had a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   The two presidential candidates split a pair of polls in
Pennsylvania, but neither lead could make up for the margin of
sampling error. A poll for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and
Philadelphia Daily News showed Bush leading 48-42 among the 595
likely voters who were questioned. A survey of 837 registered
voters for Philadelphia's WCAU-TV gave Dukakis a 46-45 lead. Both
surveys were conducted by telephone late last week.
   ``We are very, very proud of you,'' Republican campaign chairman
James A. Baker III told Quayle during a tour by Quayle of the
Bush-Quayle headquarters in Washington. ``We are very, very proud
of the job you're doing for this campaign, and we are very, very
proud of the job we know you're going to do tomorrow in Omaha.''
   When asked during the tour what tactics he'd use against
Bentsen, Quayle said, ``My debate strategy? Tune in tomorrow
night.''
   ``I have 90 minutes to explain to America why Mike Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen should lead this country,'' Bentsen said at a rally
in Austin, Texas, before leaving for Omaha. ``Ninety minutes to
describe our vision of America, to tell the voters how Lloyd
Bentsen and Mike Dukakis plan to keep our economy and our military
number one.''
   Spokesman Mike McCurry said Bentsen was working on ``the best
way of making a point memorable or punchy.''
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich, who was in Austin
helping Bentsen, said, ``We're not teaching him new positions on
issues. ... I think that's what the Quayle people have to do.''
   Bush was in Sacramento, Calif., and he outlined his plan for a
quasi-public foundation called Youth in Service to America to
encourage young people to volunteer in community activities.
   ``I want our affluent to help our poor,'' he said. ``I want the
young men and women of our tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or
the subway, or the metro, and go into the cities where the want
is.''
   The Republican presidential nominee described his proposal as an
alternative to massive federal spending.
   He said years of federal programs designed to help the poor had
proven that ``we can't buy our way out.''
   A fact sheet distributed to reporters said Bush would ask for
$100 million in federal funds to match private donations to the
foundation.
   Dukakis spoke at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and
attacked what he called Bush's ``record of failure.''
   ``Mr. Bush was given five important missions by this
administration and he failed every one,'' said the Democratic
presidential nominee. ``And that was before they asked him to pick
a running mate in this election.''
   Dukakis listed the five assignments as resolving trade problems
with Japan, heading an anti-terrorism panel, leading the war on
drugs, investigating problems in the banking industry and heading a
task force on regulatory reform.
   The Massachusetts governor said Bush ``offers slogans and
symbols; Lloyd Bentsen and I are offering real solutions to the
problems American families face every day and every week and every
month.''
   On the advertising front, The Washington Post reported in its
Wednesday editions that Bush's campaign has unleased a new attack
ad. The ad, featuring uniformed prisoners going through a revolving
door, calls attention to the controversial prison-furlough program
in Massashusetts that Dukakis modified after a first-degree
murderer raped a woman and beat her fiance.
   The Bush campaign did not respond to earlier calls from The
Associated Press asking for information on the ads.
   Another ad says Dukakis, as governor, allowed taxes to rise and
jobs to be lost.
   Reporting on a recently begun Dukakis advertising campaign
called ``The Packaging of George,'' The Post said Dukakis has spent
an estimated $1.5 million on the ads, which began Friday and will
run through the week.

<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The life of the miniskirt on the Milan
runway has proved to be as brief as its hemline.
   Only a year after Italian designers bared the leg right up to
the hip bone, they are covering it again, straight down to the
ankle.
   For the most part the new look for spring and summer 1989 is
long and loose, with a myriad of pants and long skirts creating a
softer, quieter mood than in the past few seasons.
   The change was most evident at Gianni Versace, known for his
hip-hugging styles and soaring hemlines.
   In his show Monday, Versace concentrated heavily on pants in his
subdued summer collection, either cropping them at the calf or
letting them flow softly to the ankle. Waistlines tended to be high
or placed comfortably on the hip. When he wasn't showing pants he
wrapped his models in demure loose ankle-length skirts, buttoned
down the front.
   On the whole the Versace collection concentrated on a
sophisticated summer look, which ignored the lighthearted outfits
prevalent in the first two days of the five-day showings. Although
he presented several shades such as tangerine, lemon and lime, most
of the collection was in black and white.
   Except for several trim city pants suits with small jacket and
tapered man-tailored trousers, the emphasis was on nighttime. His
favorite evening look was a one-shouldered chiffon gown, adorned
with a single tassel draped over the back on a long silk cord. Huge
gold and silver bracelets and earrings added extra glamor.
   Keith Varty, for Byblos, who opened the Monday showings at the
Milan trade fair grounds, opted for the ethnic mood which has
prevailed in most of the collections. He brings his summer client
to the shores of Copacabana in a brightly colored Carioca skirt and
flowers in her hair, or drops her off in the Virgin Islands in
loose cropped pants and jungle printed camisole.
   There wasn't much novelty in the outfits copied stitch and
ruffle from their native countries, but the fun-loving styles and
bright tropical shades created a carefree mood which is what summer
is all about.
   Also on Monday's calendar was the ``enfant terrible'' of Italian
fashion, Franco Moschino, who delights in taking the fashion crowd
for a ride _ at least at his show. In past seasons he spoofed
Chanel, by loading his models with gold chains, poked fun at
Jean-Paul Gaultier by putting everything but the kitchen sink on
hats and ridiculed the sexier outfits of his Italian colleagues by
parading real underwear down the runway.
   His latest gimmick was to show his own clothes from past seasons
as if they were his new styles and to haul the models off the
runway, to be replaced by a large video screen with the words
``What we really need is a change'' written in big letters.

   Japanese police and immigration authorities
arrested a record 7,196 foreigners in the first six months of this
year for violating immigration laws by working in Japan, the
Immigration Office said today.
   The number of violators from January-June was up 24 percent from
the previous record of 5,802 in the corresponding period of 1987,
an official of the immigration office said.
   Those arrested this year, compared to the same period last year,
included 3,013 Filipinos, down from 4,436; 1,432 Bangladeshis,
sharply up from 139; 1,169 Pakistanis, up from 288; 727 Thais, up
from 561 and 447 South Koreans, up from 81, all compared with the
like period of 1987.
   Most of those arrested were deported, the official said.
   Last year, 11,307 foreigners were arrested throughout the nation
for working illegally.

<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian, who lived for years
in Hungary, has pleaded innocent in court to four counts of spying
on American military installations for the Soviet Union.
   Stephen Joseph Ratkai, 25, shouted out a firm ``not guilty''
after each of the four charges was read Monday in Newfoundland
Supreme Court _ his first court appearance since a preliminary
inquiry ended early last month.
   Ratkai is charged with three counts of espionage and one count
of attempted espionage under the Official Secrets Act.
   He is accused of giving the Soviet Union classified military
documents about a U.S. submarine tracking base at Argentia on
Newfoundland's southern shore.
   The information is alleged to be harmful to the security of
Canada and the United States.
   Chief Justice Alex Hickman set aside a month for Ratkai's trial,
to begin Feb. 6 before a judge and jury of the provincial Supreme
Court.
   Ratkai was arrested in June at a local hotel after a lengthy
investigation by Canadian and American officials, headed by the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
   Ratkai is the son of a Canadian mother and Hungarian father who
emigrated after 1956 when Soviet troops entered Hungary and quelled
an anti-communist uprising.
   He moved back to Hungary with his grandmother at the age of four
or five.
   Ratkai later returned to Canada and worked as a short-order cook.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev won a small, painful
victory in the game of musical chairs in the Kremlin, but he failed
to unseat some outspoken critics of his most radical reforms.
   Gorbachev's most visible success was taking the place of Andrei
Gromyko as Soviet president, combining that office with the more
powerful post of general secretary of the Communist Party, as did
his three predecessors.
   And he brought some new, possibly friendlier, faces onto the
ruling Politburo.
   But ``it is still not Gorbachev's Politburo,'' Stephen Cohen,
head of Soviet studies at Princeton University, said Monday.
   ``I don't see this as a decisive consolidation of power on the
part of Gorbachev,'' Cohen said. ``As long as he is a reform
leader, there is never going to be decisive consolidation. Every
reform generates new opposition.''
   Peter Reddaway, who heads the Kennan Institute for Advanced
Russian Studies in Washington, predicted that ``in the next year or
two Gorbachev is likely to come under increasing political
pressure.''
   Gorbachev bought some time, said Cohen, by orchestrating ``a
fairly complex set of compromises by different groups on where the
reforms ought to go.''
   ``Gorbachev made some significant gains on balance, but he had
to pay a price to people who do not share his views,'' Cohen said.
   For the time being, the shuffle at the top has not visibly
reduced the power of the two Politburo members who have most
vocally differed with the reform movement, Yegor Ligachev and
Viktor Chebrikov.
   In fact, it gave them authority over two of the most important
areas of reform, leaving Ligachev in charge of reforming
agriculture and Chebrikov in charge of reforming the legal system.
   An extraordinary party conference this summer endorsed the
partial decollectivization of agriculture by leasing state-owned
land to farmers. And the conference also called for what could be
sweeping changes in the legal system, ensuring protection of
individual rights, a shift in power from the party to parliamentary
bodies and greater accountability for all those holding public
office.
   Putting Ligachev and Chebrikov in control of those reforms was
intended, said Cohen, ``to assure the moderates that the most
radical reforms are in the hands of the least radical reformers.''
   Chebrikov did relinquish his job as head of the KGB security
police, but he took a much more powerful post, party secretary.
When Yuri Andropov made exactly the same move in May 1982, he
became the front-runner to succeed the ailing Leonid I. Brezhnev,
which he did on Brezhnev's death seven months later.
   Ligachev's new status is less clear. He had been the No. 2 man
in the Kremlin, by his own account running the day-to-day affairs
of the party secretariat.
   Giving Ligachev the agricultural portfolio does not remove his
hand from control of the party secretariat.
   And it puts him in charge of food production, a sector which can
make or break Gorbachev.
   ``Gorbachev's success will rest on the degree to which he can
carry out the reforms,'' which up till now have been hampered by
conservatives and bureaucrats, Cohen said.
   And the reforms have not generated much popular support because,
in part, they have not put more food on the tables of Soviet
consumers.
   There are signs of growing concern among what Reddaway calls the
``center-right opposition'' to Gorbachev.
   ``A growing number of observers, myself included,'' find that
Gorbachev's program is ``resulting in stagnant living standards
(with rising popular discontent), mounting economic confusion,
uncertainty for Moscow's allies abroad, declining political order
(and) a potentially serious reduction in central control over the
republics,'' Reddaway said in an opinion piece published in
Sunday's Washington Post.

<HEAD>Kennedy Vote Could Be Crucial in Test of Church-State Separation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Supreme Court case involving a Christmas
nativity scene and a Jewish symbol will provide the first test of
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's views on the often emotional issue of
separation of church and state.
   Although the high court's newest member was a federal appeals
court judge for 12 years, little is known about his approach to
church-state controversies.
   The Supreme Court, beginning its 1988-89 term Monday, announced
it will conduct its latest study of the constitutionality of
religious displays in a case from Pittsburgh.
   The justices frequently have been sharply divided over
church-state issues, and Kennedy's vote could be decisive.
   On returning to the bench after a three-month summer recess, the
court issued orders in about 1,000 cases _ agreeing to grant full
review in 20 of them. That is about one-eighth of the cases that
will yield full-scale decisions before the court completes this
term's work in July.
   In its latest examination of how imposing the wall separating
church and state must be, the justices will decide whether displays
of a Christmas nativity scene and a menorah, symbolizing the Jewish
holiday of Chanukah, should be allowed at two government buildings
in Pittsburgh.
   The dispute could provide important clues on whether the court
is prepared to rearrange the constitutional tests applied in
certain freedom-of-religion cases.
   The court also agreed to consider, for the second time in two
years, the authority of states to deny unemployment benefits to
people who refuse to work on their Sabbath.
   Illinois officials refused to pay benefits to a man whose
refusal to work was not based on the doctrine of any established
religious body but on his personal Christian belief.
   In the religious display case, a federal appeals court ruled
that housing a creche and menorah at the public buildings in
Pittsburgh violated the constitution.
   Since 1981, a creche depicting the birth of Jesus Christ has
been displayed inside the main entrance to the Allegheny County
Courthouse for about six weeks during the Christmas season.
   A block away, an 18-foot menorah has been displayed each year on
the front steps of the City-County Building since 1982.
   The creche is owned by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic
men's group. The menorah, a nine-branched candelabrum, was donated
by Chabad, a Jewish organization.
   The Supreme Court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to put
Christ in Christmas by including nativity scenes in officially
sponsored holiday displays.
   In that ruling, the justices let Pawtucket, R.I., officials
place a creche in a Christmas display because such decorations as
Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen also were included.
   But lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a
narrow one, and have disallowed various Christmas displays deemed
too religious.
   In other action, the court:
   _Said it will decide whether a railroad routinely may require
its employees to take drug tests without negotiating the issue in
collective bargaining.
   The court previously announced it will decide sometime in 1989
whether constitutional privacy rights of railroad workers are
violated by federal regulations requiring blood and urine tests for
those involved in serious train accidents; and whether people
applying for U.S. Customs Service drug-enforcement jobs may be
subjected to drug tests.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Dallas whether communities may
seek to protect young teen-agers by barring anyone over 18 from
dance halls or other establishments catering to minors.
   _Voted to decide in a Minnesota case whether the federal
government may continue to bar newspapers from carrying
advertisements for privately run lotteries and other games of
chance.
   The court also said it will judge the validity of a federal
postal law's effective ban on newspapers publishing lists of
lottery winners.
   _Agreed to decide whether state colleges and universities may
ban certain commercial activities from dormitories. The justices
will review a ruling that a New York school violated students'
rights by barring a cookware company from making its sales pitch in
dorm rooms.

   A former U.S. Marine munitions expert, who
sought a ``tough Irishman'' to deliver a bomb hidden in a tape
recorder to his wife in Scotland, has been arrested, police said.
   The bomb was set to explode when the play button was pressed,
Nassau County Detective Sgt. Daniel Severin said Monday.
   Charles Hili, 54, who is in the middle of a divorce, was
arrested after a man answered an advertisement Hili placed in the
Irish Voice newspaper Oct. 1, seeking a ``tough Irishman ... to
handle a confidential assignment,'' police said.
   An Irish-American man who answered the ad called police after
Hili told him his plan, Severin said.
   The man, who was not identified, met with Hili on Sunday as
police watched, the detective said.
   Hili, who lives in Elmont near this Long Island city, spelled
out his instructions and handed the man a tape recorder with a bomb
inside, police said.
   He told the man to fly to Ireland, take a ferry to Scotland and
deliver the tape recorder to his wife's home in Glasgow, said
Severin.
   Hili, a self-employed lumber buyer, made arrangements to pay the
man $2,000, Severin said.
   Hili was charged with criminal solicitation, criminal possession
of a weapon and conspiracy. First District Court Judge John Evans
ordered him held without bail.

<HEAD>New Air Force One Won't Be Ready for Reagan's Farewell Flight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan won't get to ride on a new
Air Force One before he leaves office because the airplane's
contractor is months behind schedule with no prospect of making up
the delay, Air Force and company officials say.
   The Boeing Co., which is building the new Air Force One and a
back-up plane by customizing huge 747 passenger jet airframes,
``advised us last week they won't be prepared even to finalize a
new delivery schedule until mid-to-late October,'' Lt. Col. Darrel
C. Hayes, an Air Force spokesman, said Monday.
   ``So, obviously, delivery won't occur in November as anticipated
but rather next year,'' Hayes continued. ``And the delivery is
going to occur later in the year, probably summer, and not in
January (before Reagan steps down).''
   Boeing's contract with the Air Force called for delivery of the
first plane by Nov. 30. Three months ago, however, Air Force
officials disclosed Boeing was going to miss that deadline because
of problems with installing wiring for the plane's specialized
communications gear.
   At the time, James C. McKinney, the chief of the White House's
military office, said he still was hopeful the company could get
the first plane delivered by Jan. 20 _ Inauguration Day _ to enable
Reagan to take a ride on the new plane as he began his retiremnt to
Californaia.
   Other White House aides have said they wanted Reagan to have an
opportunity to fly on the plane since he was the president who took
the political heat from pushing Congress for money to replace the
existing jets.
   Boeing was awarded a firm, fixed price contract totaling $249.8
million for the two 747s in the summer of 1986. They will replace
Boeing 707s that are now 15 years and 25 years old, respectively.
   According to Hayes, Boeing is in the midst of a special
engineering study, trying to set a realistic schedule for
completing the lead plane and obtaining its flight certification.
   ``But the scope of the work is such that the plane is obviously
not going to be ready even for a January delivery,'' the spokesman
said. ``The installation of wiring harnesses, communications checks
and flight checks are still to be done.''
   Hayes said most of the delays stemmed from unexpected problems
in stringing wiring throughout the plane to support its specialized
communications gear.
   ``There was just a lot of extra engineering and design work that
was required,'' he said.
   ``Right now, we're working with the Air Force and expect by the
middle or end of October to have a new schedule,'' Boeing spokesman
Peter Dakan said.
   ``But I wouldn't contradict'' statements that the plane won't be
ready to ferry Reagan into retirement, he added.
   The term Air Force One is actually a radio call sign applied to
any airplane that is carrying a president. But the term has become
synonymous with the two Boeing 707s maintained by the 89th Military
Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., outside Washington.
   The planes are recognizable by their distinctive striping and
American flag on their tails. The Air Force says they are so old
that it is becoming increasingly difficult to support them with
spare parts.
   The new 747s are being constructed to carry 70 passengers and 23
crew members, compared with the 400 passengers that can be carried
by the commercial version of the four-engine jet. The existing
presidential planes can carry 59 passengers along with a crew of 10.
   The Air Force has said the new planes will have state-of-the-art
communications equipment; an emergency medical facility; and
special work and rest areas for the president, his staff, the
Secret Service and the news media.

   The Congressional Record is the verbatim
record of every word said on the floor of the Senate and the House
_ except for when it isn't.
   It is a congressional privilege to change the Congressional
Record when it suits.
   Sometimes it is only a matter of cleaning up a congressman's
grammar or misstatements of fact.
   Changes sometimes involve matters of substance, sometimes not.
   Sometimes they are made to soften a stinging phrase, or smooth
over an embarrassment.
   Former Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., contends in his recently
published autobiography, ``Goldwater,'' that sometimes changes are
made for reasons of politics.
   An example, he declares, occurred several years ago on the
morning after a speech by Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd
of West Virginia.
   Byrd, had, Goldwater said, ``used some frothy language that
wasn't particularly fitting for the floor.''
   ``I can't recall exactly what he was excited about, but his
anger poured out as if he had just finished a bad jug of West
Virginia moonshine.''
   ``God, I said to myself, I've got to get a copy of that speech
from the Congressional Record. He said some things that will really
hurt him. We'll send it along to the Republican party in West
Virginia.''
   But after a line-by-line search of the Record, Goldwater said,
Byrd's remarks were nowhere to be found.
   ``So I went back to the Senate reporter's room and asked,
`Where's all that stuff Byrd talked about last night.''
   ```Oh,' the reporter said, `he edited it out.'''
   Goldwater's conclusion: ``Today, some senators operate regularly
on this double standard _ saying one thing on the floor to capture
state or media attention, but deleting it from the official record
so their precise remarks cannot be used against them.''
   Changes _ large and small _ are made in the Record virtually
daily.
   A dispute flared on the House floor last week during
consideration of legislation to require a study of the federal pay
system to determine if women are being paid less than men for
comparable work.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, told Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., that
the reason he did not know a detail about the bill was that he
rarely bothered to attend meetings of the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee which had considered it.
   Burton said he served on many other committees and had higher
priorities ``and listening to the gentlewoman from Ohio at these
meetings is not one of my top priorities.''
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., angrily intervened, accusing the
congresswoman of ``smart-aleck remarks.''
   After an intervening vote, Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif.,
demanded that Solomon apologize.
   But here the words he said and the words recorded in the
Congressional Record part company.
   What Dymally was heard to say, and what he did say as confirmed
by a review of the television tape of the proceedings, was:
   ``If there is any decency left in the gentleman, he will come to
the floor here and ask that those words be stricken from the
Record.''
   Perhaps that was too strong.
   The Congressional Record version: ``If there is any courtesy
left in the gentleman, he will come to the floor here and ask that
those words be stricken from the Record.''
   In the end courtesy did prevail.
   The gentleman from New York already had apologized, the
gentlewoman from Ohio said.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Pledge to Debate Despite Sponsorship Withdrawal by
League</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush are sticking
by plans to meet in a second presidential debate later this month,
despite the League of Women Voters' withdrawal as sponsors in a
dispute over control of format and other details.
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, sponsors of
the first presidential debate and Wednesday's debate between vice
presidential nominees, quickly stepped in Monday and agreed to take
over sponsorship.
   ``There is going to be a second presidential debate,'' said Bush
spokesman Mark Goodin.
   The second debate, viewed as an opportunity for Dukakis as he
trails Bush in most polls, was scheduled to be held in Los Angeles
on Oct. 13 or 14, depending on the length of the American League
baseball playoffs. The campaigns said they would stick to those
dates.
   Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said it hoped
to keep the debate in Los Angeles and was seeking local groups to
help it finance preparations, which the League had estimated at
$500,000.
   But the League of Women Voters has rights to the Shrine Memorial
Auditorium in Los Angeles, where it was scheduled. And Vicky
Harian, the League's debates director, said ``I doubt very
seriously'' it would relinquish its rights.
   All sides said they would look elsewhere if a Los Angeles site
cannot be arranged.
   ``I want to go forward in Los Angeles,'' Dukakis said. ``The
agreement (with the Bush campaign) provides that if for some reason
the sponsor decides to pull out, we still go ahead. I want to go
ahead.''
   The commission agreed to follow the two campaigns' detailed
agreement for debate format and staging _ an agreement the League
denounced as a ``charade'' that would stiffle spontaneity and a
true exchange on the issues.
   ``We have no intention of becoming an accessory to the
hoodwinking of the American public,'' said Nancy M. Neuman, the
league's president.
   Neuman contended the campaigns have so controlled the format
that questioning by a panel of journalists will be subject to
``very clear restrictions in terms of what they can ask.'' When
pressed to back up her charge, she pointed to script approval
required for the moderator's remarks, and to her disagreement with
the pattern for follow-up questions by the panel and rebuttal by
the candidates.
   In a printed statement she did not read at her news conference,
Neuman said the agreement ``would perpetrate a fraud on the
American voter'' and ``add debates to their list of campaign-trail
charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to
tough questions.''
   But the commission director rejected suggestions the format was
too controlled and pointed to the success of the first debate.
   The League's involvement in 1988 debates has been long at issue.
Spurred in part by discontent with the League's sponsorship of
debates in previous presidential elections, the Republican and
Democratic parties joined with the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates to sponsor them this year.
   But sponsorship itself became one of the items at issue in
hardball debate negotiations between the Dukakis and Bush
campaigns. The campaigns ultimately agreed to two debates, one
sponsored by the commission and one by the League, plus a vice
presidential debate under commission sponsorship.
   At her news conference, Neuman acknowledged that at the heart of
their dispute was the League's lack of involvement in the agreement.
   ``The issue is, who's in control of the debate,'' she said.
   Bush campaign officials privately belittled the League's
complaints as ``nitpicking items'' and denied an attempt to control
questioning.
   One Bush campaign source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the League's action ``guarantees they're out of the debate
business for good. They made the mistake of misunderstanding their
role.''

   Iran is reorganizing its military forces
and seeking advanced weapons in the wake of disasterous defeats in
the war with Iraq that forced it to accept a United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire.
   ``The reconstruction of the armed forces has a very high
priority'' in the overall post-war reconstruction program, Defense
Minister Brig. Gen. Mohammad Hussein Jalali stressed last week.
   ``The Army and the Revolutionary Guards Corps must definitely be
strengthened,'' he said in an interview with Tehran's Kayhan daily.
   ``This does not mean reinforcement for an offensive, but rather
the prevention of probable aggression and for defense.''
   Asked if Iran's unconditional acceptance of the U.N. Security
Council's cease-fire resolution will ease a U.S.-led arms embargo
that caused major problems during the 8-year war, Jalali replied:
``Not yet.
   ``But there have been some signs. The world has now realized
that Iran's cause has been genuine.''
   Diplomatic sources have said that the Iranians are badly short
of combat aircraft, tanks, radar and other sophisticated weaponry.
   Even before the Iraqi victories, the Iranians were believed to
be chronically short of heavy weapons.
   The Iraqis claim they captured much of Iran's operational armor
in a series of offensives between April and August that retook all
the territory the Iranians had seized in the previous six years.
   U.S. sources in the Persian Gulf reported that when the Iraqis
scored one of their key battlefield victories shortly before July
20, the Iranians hastily withdrew tanks based on Sirri and Abu Musa
islands in the southern gulf and rushed them to the front.
   One source said the move ``showed how desperate the Iranians
were for supplies and weapons. They didn't have much of anything
left.''
   The speed with which the Iranians were driven back surprised
even the Iraqis. Iranian resistance, mainly by the Revolutionary
Guards, appeared to collapse rapidly as the Iraqis regained the
offensive after years of static defense.
   The Iranians' abrupt acceptance of U.N. Resolution 598, the
basis for the Aug. 20 cease-fire, stunned many Iranians, including
the military, said businessmen who were in Tehran at the time.
   ``Several of the young men in my family were at the front and
they couldn't believe it,'' said one Iranian, in Nicosia to attend
a seminar.
   ``They knew things weren't going well, but they were absolutely
speechless. They couldn't understand how it all caved in so fast.
Some were relieved that the dying was over. But some were extremely
bitter.''
   ``They argued that if we were going to accept (Resolution) 598,
why didn't we do it while we still occupied Iraqi territory, while
we had something to bargain with? A lot of people are asking such
questions,'' the businessman said, speaking on condition he was not
identified.
   There have been indications that the Revolutionary Guards, known
as Pasdaran, have been blamed for Iran's defeats.
   The corps was originally formed as a paramilitary force to
safeguard the Islamic revolution. But it was thrust into a military
role by Iraq's invasion in September 1980 and eventually eclipsed
the regular army which had been built up by the shah and was
distrusted by the hierarchy.
   Iran's Parliament last month dismissed Mohsen Rafiqdoust, the
government minister in charge of the corps. He was replaced by Ali
Shamkhani, 33, deputy commander of the corps' ground forces.
   But Iranian leaders have publicly defended the Pasdaran.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told corps commanders at a military
seminar last month: ``You are my closest and dearest aides.''
   A unified military command set up by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, named acting commander-in-chief by Khomeini last June
in a bid to reverse Iran's battlefield defeats, has been reshaping
the armed forces.
   The reorganization has centered on the 350,000-strong
Revolutionary Guards.
   But moves to merge the guards with the 200,000-man regular army
have been shelved.
   ``The Pasdaran have become very powerful and they're not going
to surrender that easily,'' one Western analyst noted.
   But the parallel chains of command that so bedeviled the
Iranians during the war have been streamlined to produce what
Rafsanjani hopes will be a more cohesive Iranian military machine.
   Rafsanjani told the Pasdaran that they must temper their Islamic
zeal with conventional military training and discipline.
   ``You must pay attention to the hierarchy and to orders,''
Rafsanjani cautioned them.

   Mention Rep. Newt Gingrich to stalwarts of the
Democratic Party and they vow through gritted teeth to do
everything in their power to unseat the Georgia Republican.
   ``You've got a guy in Georgia who's trying to destroy the
Democratic Party,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of
the House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``That's his
sole mission in life. There's a price to pay for that, and the
price is return to the private sector.''
   Traditionally, the DCCC has come to the aid of promising
Democratic challengers, providing campaign funds and advice. But in
David Worley's campaign to replace Gingrich, the committee is
leaving no stone unturned.
   In January, the DCCC filed mail fraud charges against Gingrich
and a political action committee he heads _ Conservatives for Hope
and Opportunity. The complaint to the U.S. Postal Service received
widespread publicity, but no action was taken against Gingrich or
the PAC.
   Then in May, on the same day Gingrich filed an ethics complaint
against House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the committee accused
the Georgia Republican of accepting $13,000 from a group of wealthy
friends in 1977 to write a book he never produced.
   The object of the committee's attention is a conservative,
five-term representative who does not shrink from the opportunity
to attack Democrats.
   Gingrich has accused Wright of improperly using his position for
financial gain, including the allegation that the House speaker
made unduly high royalties on his book. A House ethics committee is
investigating the complaints.
   And last month, Gingrich called Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis ``nuts,'' and accused the candidate of being a
``left-winger'' who opposes weapons systems supported by Republican
George Bush.
   The Dukakis campaign dismissed Gingrich's comments as ``typical
of his nasty approach.''
   Gingrich's opponent for the House seat _ Worley _ is a
29-year-old attorney from Jonesboro making his first bid for public
office.
   After a close Democratic primary win in August, Worley received
$5,000 from the committee to pay off his primary debts and the
promise of another $5,000 for the fall campaign.
   The amount is the maximum the committee can provide in direct
contributions, but legally it also can give up to $40,000 in
``coordinated expenditures'' for such services as polling and voter
identification. Anthony said that amount would be determined by the
committee's ongoing assessment of Worley's chances of defeating
Gingrich.
   In his campaign arsenal, Worley has incorporated the committee's
charges of mail fraud and the book allegations against Gingrich as
well as a claim that Gingrich wants to abolish Social Security.
   That allegation stems from a plan Gingrich proposed which calls
for people under 40 to get no Social Security retirement, but
require them to put 10 percent of their incomes into individual
retirement accounts.
   Worley also has accused Gingrich of missing 70 percent of his
House committee meetings and of ignoring the concerns of his
constituents while traveling the country to promote his own
conservative agenda.
   Gingrich acknowledges that he is potentially vulnerable on that
issue, but said the voters in his suburban Atlanta district
understand that his role as a national spokesman for the GOP right
helps him better represent them in Congress.
   ``I think that's what you want in a congressman, to take local
problems and understand their national implications and speak out
on how we can change things in America so that we are changing
things in the 6th District,'' Gingrich said.
   Anthony said Worley is beginning to ``score some good points
against Gingrich,'' but he conceded that a Democratic victory in
November would be an upset.
   And if Worley fails, there's always 1990, Anthony said.
   ``Sometimes it takes a four-year effort to knock off an
incumbent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gadhafi's Opening To Chad Another Sign Of Moderation</HEAD>

   Libya's decision to re-establish diplomatic
relations with Western-backed Chad is another sign that Col.
Moammar Gadhafi is moving toward moderation, or at least wants to
be seen that way.
   The Libyan leader has been having a hard time removing the label
of terrorism attached to his regime. Just last week, the top U.S.
anti-terrorism official accused Libya of continuing to support Abu
Nidal, a Palestinian blamed for engineering several spectacular
attacks, including a commando strike this summer on a Greek cruise
ship that killed nine people.
   Gadhafi is keen on improving relations with the United States,
which led a campaign in early 1986 to convince the West to join an
economic boycott to punish Libya for its alleged support of
international terrorism.
   But last Friday, the West German government cited recent
``positive changes'' in Libya when it announced it is sending an
ambassador back to Tripoli. The post had been vacant since spring
1986, shortly after a bombing of a Berlin disco, an attack that
U.S. officials blamed on Gadhafi. The U.S. administration responded
with bombing raids on the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi.
   In an interview with The Associated Press last month, Gadhafi
expressed confidence that Libya-U.S. relations will improve after
January, when President Reagan leaves the White House.
   Gadhafi's turnabout regarding Chad is one of several foreign and
domestic changes indicating that he may have decided that he will
get more mileage out of moderation than intransigence.
   In dealing with Chad, for example, Gadhafi ``passed from (a
policy of) conquest to negotiation,'' commented a European diplomat
who has been monitoring developments in Libya for years.
   After years of bitter fighting in the deserts of northern Chad,
Libya and Chad announced on Monday that they have restored
diplomatic relations and said they will settle their border dispute
in a responsible and understanding manner.
   In the interview with the AP on Sept. 5, Gadhafi said he was
willing to negotiate on the status of the Aouzou Strip, a
45,000-square-mile stretch of land possibly rich in minerals that
borders the two countries.
   More than once Libya had labeled Chad's President Hissene Habre
as a stooge of ``imperialist'' France and the United States, which
backed Chad in the conflict.
   The diplomat said Gadhafi's foreign policy had been feeling the
influence of Libyan Prime Minister Omar al-Muntasser, considered a
moderate. He was named to the post in a Cabinet shuffle earlier
this year.
   A West German foreign ministry official, in explaining why Bonn
decided to upgrade its diplomatic relations, cited Gadhafi's
freeing of many Chadian prisoners this summer as well as ``internal
reforms.''
   This year Gadhafi has called for the abolitin of the death
penalty in Libya, freed some political prisoners from Libyan jails
and loosened economic restrictions, even giving his blessing to
black market enterprises.
   Gadhafi has been paying special attention to forging solid ties
with his North African neighbors. He restored relations with
Tunisia in December after a two-year hiatus following Libya's
expulsion of more than 30,000 immigrant workers. Looming largely in
that move were economic considerations _ Libya depends heavily on
the workers for farm and other manual labor.
   Economic considerations also figure in Libya's links with
Western European countries. For example, wanting to expand its
economic base beyond crude oil sales, Libya recently opened up a
chain of gasoline distributorships in Italy.
   As for West Germany, Libya is its No. 2 oil supplier, after
Britain.
   Terrorism remains the biggest hurdle in Gadhafi's proclaimed
quest for better foreign relations.
   ``We hope that has changed for the better, but we will have to
wait and see,'' said the Foreign Ministry official last week.
   West Berlin authorities have said they have no concrete
indications that Libya was involved in the disco attack and said
they suspect Syria instead.
   The Reagan administration is firm on holding Gadhafi to blame
for many major terrorist attacks.
   Its No. 1 counterterrorism official, L. Paul Bremer, said last
week that the 1986 U.S. bombing raids and Western pressure has
caused Libya to ``drive the terrorism'' into ``different channels,
so that instead of using diplomats and business,'' Gadhafi is
``doing it more through surrogates, like Abu Nidal and the Japanese
Red Army,'' a terrorist group which claimed the bombing a club in
Naples, Italy, in April. A U.S. servicewoman was killed.
   Gadhafi denies he sponsors terrorism. But Abu Nidal is reported
frequently in Tripoli.

   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees said the
organization needs $120 million to meet its budget this year and
appealed to U.N. members to pay and increase their contributions.
   Jean-Pierre Hocke addressed the commission's executive committee
at the opening of its annual meeting Monday. He said the agency had
increased its 1988 budget from $377.5 million to $420.7 million in
September because of ``developments in Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and
Hong Kong.''
   He said the organization has received only $300 million and
needs more than $120 million to cover costs.
   During the one-week meeting of the 43-nation executive board the
delegates are to approve the 1989 budget for the commission.
   Judith Kumin, a spokeswoman for the commission, said the 1989
goal is a budget of $400 million.
   The commission attempts to aid the world's estimated 12 million
refugees. According to U.N. statistics, more than 5 million are
refugees from the war in Afghantistan and nearly 5 million are
Africans fleeing from conflicts and food shortages.
   Most of the others are from southeast Asia and Central America.

<HEAD>President Roh Calls For New Era After Olympics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today hailed the
Olympic Games as a major turning point in Korea's history and
declared he would launch new efforts to reunite the peninsula and
build full democracy.
   In a speech to the National Assembly, Roh said he would keep an
election promise to let voters pass judgment on how well his
government has kept its promise of democratic reforms, but he did
not say what form the assessment would take.
   Roh said the Olympics, which ended Sunday, were a major success
for South Korea and would help provide impetus for further progress.
   ``We are opening a new chapter of history in which Korea should
achieve both unification and prosperity and emerge as a major
player on the world scene in the 21st century,'' he said.
   The peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
U.S.-supported South Korea at the end of World War II. North Korea
invaded South Korea in 1950 and a truce in 1953 re-established a
demilitarized zone dividing the country.
   North Korea boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host
the games was rejected.
   Roh, in the nationally televised speech, said it was time to
overcome the divisions of the past and called for a major effort to
build a democratic system and share the nation's prosperity.
   He said he would present a new plan to build ties with the North
but gave no details.
   Roh repeated an offer made in July to visit Pyongyang, the
capital of North Korea, for a summit meeting with President Kim Il
Sung to discuss ``all pending issues.''
   The two Koreas are to resume talks Oct. 13 on trying to reduce
tension. Negotiations in August failed to make any progress.
   ``I will endeavor to bring about a spring of reconciliation
between the South and the North, which have remained in a deep
freeze for 40 years,'' Roh said.
   The Soviet Union, China and most other communist nations
participated in the Olympics and Roh said that provided an
opportunity for South Korea to build ties with the communist world
that ease tension with the North.
   He also said South Korea would maintain its close ties with the
United States, Japan and other allies. ``The United States is an
ally with whom we have been defending the peace and freedom of the
Korean peninsula,'' he said.
   But Roh also said the threat of war with the North still existed
and the ``security situation on the Korean peninsula and in
northeast Asia remains as grave as ever.''
   Roh vowed to introduce full democracy. ``The authoritarian rule
that caused public anxiety, tension and distrust and strife for the
past four decades has unmistakably been abolished,'' he said.
   He said radical students that have staged frequent
anti-government demonstrations were seeking ``a violent class
revolution.''
   ``They are thus attempting to overthrow our free democratic
system through violence and other illegal acts. Such activities
cannot be tolerated anymore,'' he said.
   The president expressed confidence in the country's economy and
predicted exports would reach $90 billion by 1992, compared to
$47.3 billion last year. He announced a budget for 1989 of $27
billion _ an 11 percent increase.

<HEAD>Passage Near on Bill Allowing Veterans' Appeals in Federal Courts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving to break a decades-long
stalemate with legislation that would allow veterans to go outside
the Veterans Administration to appeal denial of benefits.
   The House voted 400-0 Monday for a bill that would allow
veterans, for the first time in 170 years, to appeal VA denials to
a federal court.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said arrangements have been worked
out with the Senate to write a compromise bill in a conference
committee. The Senate has passed its own version of the legislation.
   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, said his panel has been trying to
change the appeals process since 1952.
   Standing in the way, he said, was a lack of consensus among
veterans' groups _ who are now in agreement.
   The House legislation would establish a new Court of Veterans
Appeals. As passed Monday, the House bill would abolish the
existing Board of Veterans' Appeals _ part of the VA and currently
the last resort for veterans unhappy with decisions to deny them
benefits.
   Edwards said the compromise would retain the board but make it
independent of the VA. The court would be established, but the
number of judges would decrease from the 65 envisioned in the House
bill to seven under the proposed compromise.
   Decisions of the new court could be appealed to the existing
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on any legal matter,
but not on factual findings.
   The legislation also would end a Civil War-era law that limits
attorney's fees for veterans' claims to $10 per claim _ making it
difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by
the VA.
   The House bill would prohibit attorneys from charging any fee in
connection with an application for benefits. However, once the VA
denies a claim, a veteran could hire and pay a reasonable fee to a
lawyer.
   A copy of the fee agreement must be filed with the new court,
which could order a fee reduction if a judge finds the amount
excessive.

<HEAD>Employers Must Prove Health Hazards To Exclude Women From Some
Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers must have proof of potential fetal
damage before they can fire or refuse to hire pregnant or fertile
women in jobs with exposures to toxic chemicals or radiation under
new federal guidelines.
   ``A policy that expressly excludes women on the basis of
pregnancy or capacity to become pregnant on its face discriminates
against women on the basis of sex'' in violation of a 1982
amendment to the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission said Monday.
   To justify such exclusions, the EEOC said employers must support
their decisions with ``reputable, objective, scientific evidence''
that a hazard adversely affects the potential offspring only
through the female parent and not the male.
   ``This approach prevents unnecessary limitations on women's
employment opportunities, while preserving the employers' _ and
society's _ legitimate interest in protecting the health of
offspring,'' the commission said in an 11-page policy directive to
its enforcement officials.
   The commission addressed the issue amid a growing log of court
cases and estimates that as many as 15 million to 20 million jobs
in the country expose workers to chemicals that might cause
reproductive injuries.
   In addition, new ``high tech'' industries are posing previously
unsuspected hazards. ``Video display workers and semiconductor
manufacturers, in particular, are suspected of being at risk from
exposure to reproductive hazards,'' the commission said.
   While evidence so far of reproductive risks is largely
inconclusive, the commission said, the ``same impulse that has led
some employers to exaggerate the risks of employing handicapped
workers can also lead to exaggeration of risks to offspring.''
   Citing estimates that 58 percent of all women in the country
will be employed by the year 1990, the EEOC said less than 9
percent of those fertile will be pregnant in any given year. And
for women over age 30 in blue-collar jobs, the pregnancy rate is
less than 2 percent.
   ``Moreover, even some fertile women, for a variety of reasons
including celibacy, sexual orientation or relations with a
non-fertile male, are at little or no risk of becoming pregnant,''
the commission said.
   The commission told its enforcement officers that employers can
be excluded from sex bias charges if their exclusion policies are
limited ``only to the extent necessary to protect employees'
offspring from reproductive or fetal hazard.''
   For example, some mutagens can be equally hazardous to
reproduction whether it is the father or mother who is exposed
before conception. A policy prohibiting employment of women, but
not men, because of potential exposure to mutagens would thus be
illegal.
   Furthermore, most toxins pose the greatest risk during the first
eight weeks of pregnancy. But others such as lead pose the greatest
risk after the first trimester because the placenta is not yet
operating, the commission said.
   Those types of factors _ relying on other agencies such as the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for guidance _ should be taken into account
in weighing sex discrimination complaints, the commission said.
   It also instructed its investigators to weigh on a case-by-case
basis whether there were less discriminatory alternatives such as
protective equipment or temporary job transfers available to reduce
a fetal hazard.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed at the government's latest auction.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $7.0 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.23 percent, the
same rate as last week. Another $7.0 billion was sold in six-month
bills at an average discount rate of 7.46 percent, down from 7.48
percent last week.
   The rates on six-month bills were the lowest since they sold for
7.34 percent on Sept. 19.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.47 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,817.20 and and 7.86 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,622.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.18 percent
last week after averaging 8.07 percent the week before.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush suffered his deepest
embarrassment at the very beginning of the campaign in a
humiliating third-place showing in the snows of Iowa, but
politicians of both parties concede he's rebounded and has become
competitive.
   ``It's a horse race now,'' said Iowa Republican Chairman Michael
Mahaffey, voicing a general consensus that the race with Democrat
Michael Dukakis is a virtual tossup in the state.
   ``George Bush is very highly competitive, there is no doubt in
my mind about that,'' said Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
   Dukakis is still favored in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin in the
upper Midwest, according to an Associated Press survey of political
leaders, independent analysts and public opinion polls.
   But the degree to which Bush has gained momentum in Iowa is
remarkable in a state where GOP strategists only a couple of months
ago were publicly worrying that a Bush disaster would ripple down
the ticket and damage congressional and legislative candidates.
   His poor showing in the Feb. 8 precinct caucuses, coupled with a
drought-starved farm economy, caused Democratic glee and even
brought three campaign stops from Dukakis, though the state has
only eight electoral votes.
   The tenor has changed.
   ``Republicans are euphoric,'' said Larry Pope, a Drake
University law professor who maps GOP legislative election tactics.
``Our candidates' chances are improving because of Bush's chances.''
   From a more than 2-1 deficit in June, the latest poll published
by the Des Moines Register showed Bush trailing only 47 percent to
42 percent just after the Republican convention.
   That comeback caps a drive that began in the winter when Bush
was crushed by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, and even ran behind
television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Politicians offer a variety of reasons for Bush's resurgence,
with many reminding that Dukakis didn't fare all that well in the
precinct caucuses, either, running third behind Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.
   Bush, they argue, is no longer running against Midwesterner
Dole, but faces Easterner Dukakis.
   ``George Bush and the Republican Party are a pretty known
quantity and Mike Dukakis isn't,'' said George Wittgraf, who runs
Bush's efforts in the state.
   Others argued that the wounds are only now beginning to heal
among GOP activists who waged an intense and occasionally bitter
campaign. But Pope said Bush is recovering from the bashing
inflicted by the Democrats, not his fellow Republicans.
   Others argued that Bush suffered because his close attachment to
President Reagan, whose farm policies have drawn criticism in Iowa.
   ``Reagan is not popular in Iowa and Bush's attachment was a real
problem during the winter,'' Pope said. ``As Bush has developed his
own persona, he's gotten stronger in Iowa.''
   That strength is even more visible in the farm states of Kansas
and Nebraska, which borders on Iowa, according to the AP survey.
Democrats also concede Dukakis is probably slightly behind in
neighboring Missouri. Dukakis seems to be favored in the Dakotas.
   Democratic consultant Paulee Lipsman argued that the Bush forces
in Iowa were jolted into a new campaign style by their winter
surprise. ``They weren't going to make the same mistake twice,''
she said.
   Mahaffey, however, noted that Iowa hasn't backed a Democratic
presidential candidate since the 1964 Lyndon Johnson landslide.
   ``There is still some inclination of Iowans at the presidential
level to vote for Republicans,'' Mahaffey said. ``I don't want to
say it's a Republican state.''

<HEAD>NIH Board Recommends Human Experiment With Genetically Altered
Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what could be a major step toward gene
therapy, a federal advisory board recommended that researchers be
allowed for the first time to inject genetically altered cells into
human patients.
   ``If this protocol were to work, I'd expect that within six to
12 months there could be a proposal to do a gene therapy
experiment,'' said Dr. William J. Gartland, the executive secretary
of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee to the National
Institutes of Health.
   The goal of gene therapy _ a much more controversial matter _ is
to treat a genetic disease by replacing a defective or missing gene
that causes an inherited illness. The proposed experiment would not
be gene therapy but would use many of the same techniques.
   The advisory committee on Monday voted 16-5 in favor of the
proposal to inject genetically altered cells into patients to
determine how well a certain form of cancer therapy is working. A
so-called marker gene would be put into a patient's cells in the
lab and then placed back inside the patient. The experiment would
not attempt to fight the cancer, but would track the genetically
altered cells carrying the altered genes, Gartland said.
   The experiment would be limited to 10 patients, and those
patients would have life expectations of only about 90 days due to
the advancement of their cancer, he said.
   NIH Director Dr. James B. Wyngaarden and the Food and Drug
Administration still must approve the proposal before it is carried
out.
   Due to the split in the vote, a decision from Wyngaarden ``will
probably take a couple of months,'' Gartland said. ``The NIH
director will probably want to know why those five people voted
against it.''
   The main concern for those who opposed the experiment, he said,
was ``what they're using is a virus to `infect' the patients' cells
and put the marker in the patients' cells. The concern is that the
virus'' itself could make the patients sick, even though the virus'
ability to be infectious would be removed before it is placed in
the cell.
   ``The people who submitted the protocol feel it is not dangerous
and that they've completed enough of the safety testing to say
that,'' Gartland said. ``There are some people on the committee who
have some reservations about it, but these are very terminally ill
patients with cancer, so it's probably a safe procedure in these
circumstances.''
   Under an already established procedure, researchers can remove
tumor cells from a cancer patient and grow them in the laboratory,
he said. When the cells are put back in the patient, they tend to
return to attack the tumor they used to be a part of.
   In the past, these cells have been labeled with a radioactive
isotope so researchers could track them when they are inside the
patient.
   ``The problem is the radioisotope is a short-lived isotope and
they would like to be able to follow these cells that they put back
into the patient for a longer period of time,'' he said.
   The radioisotope has a half-life of 11 days, he said. By
comparison, the proposed antibiotic resistant gene would be
traceable for months, he said.
   To trace those genes, researchers would use a probe to biopsy
the tumor and see if the cells removed included those marked with
the different gene, he said.
   ``They're trying to find out how well the tumor-fighting cells
go back to the tumor they were taken from and how long they
persist,'' he said. ``With this technique, they could monitor them
for longer periods of time.''
   Although the notion of gene therapy has triggered controversy,
Gartland said the proposal at NIH is ``in some ways ... less
controversial because the gene here is just a marker. ... It's a
more benign step than gene therapy.''
   The proposal by Dr. W. French Anderson of the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute would be carried out by that institute
along with the National Cancer Institute.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Complaint On Miners' Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of American coal miners are not
compensated for black lung disease because the Labor Department
used an arbitrary cutoff in deciding who can get benefits, a lawyer
for the miners said.
   The denials were contrary to the intent of a 1977 federal law
intended to make it easier for miners to receive disability
payments, attorney Paul March Smith told the Supreme Court on
Monday.
   Smith asked the justices to uphold a March 1987 ruling in which
the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Labor Department
to review claims of some miners who were denied benefits in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.
   The order applied to black lung disease victims who had worked
less than 10 years in the mines and who had failed to exhaust
administrative remedies or had missed deadlines for filing court
appeals.
   Coal mine operators have said the appellate court ruling could
cost the industry $13.6 billion in additional payments if it is
applied nationwide.
   ``The government estimates that 94,000 cases could be
reviewed,'' Smith said. ``Not all of those would get black lung
payments. But it is in the several tens of thousands that would
benefit.''
   Miners afflicted with black lung disease or pneumoconiosis, a
lung disorder caused by breathing coal dust for a long period of
time, receive compensation for their disability through a special
fund administered by the federal government.
   Smith argued that Congress ordered the Labor Department in 1977
to come up with new criteria for determining eligibility for
benefits because too many claims were being denied and ordered it
to review, using the new standards, claims which it rejected
previously.
   Some longtime miners then received benefits, but Smith said the
department refused to approve claims for less experienced miners
unless they provided indisputable evidence that their disability
was caused by on-the-job exposure to coal dust.
   ``The reviews were meaningless,'' he said. ``If they didn't have
10 years in the mine, they were categorically excluded from
benefits. ... It was giving with the right hand and taking away
with the left.''
   Lawyers representing the federal government and mining companies
argued that no miners who deserve benefits are being denied black
lung disease payments.
   ``The Department of Labor ... delivered billions of dollars of
benefits to hundreds of thousands of claimants, many of whom do not
have black lung disease,'' said Mark E. Solomons, a lawyer for the
coal companies.
   Donald B. Ayer, the deputy solicitor general for the Justice
Department, said Congress wanted miners to get fair treatment but
it opposed payment of benefits unless the disability was proven
through a careful medical review.
   The Supreme Court is expected to announce a decision sometime
next year.

   ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' which chronicles the
tragic life of naturalist Dian Fossey, was the nation's box office
leader last weekend with total ticket sales of $3.5 million.
   Starring Sigourney Weaver as a passionate protector of animal
rights, the film was in its second week of a fairly limited
release, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
   Claiming the No. 2 spot was ``Heartbreak Hotel,'' a new twist on
the Elvis Presley legend, with receipts of $2.06 million. It was
followed closely in third by the well-established hit ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' which grossed $2.05 million.
   ``Dead Ringers,'' the most popular movie the previous weekend,
fell to No. 4, with revenues totaling $2.04 million. One of the
summer's enduring hits, ``Die Hard,'' finished at No. 5, with a
take of $2.02 million.
   ``Crossing Delancey'' collected $1.8 million for sixth place and
had the highest per-screen average of all the Top 10 movies. It was
trailed by newcomer ``Elvira, Mistress of the Dark,'' which ended
up in seventh with sales of $1.7 million
   Rounding out the 10 best-selling movies were ``Cocktail'' in
eighth with $1.544 million; ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in ninth

<HEAD>Worried Chileans Stock Up On Food Before Presidential Referendum</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY5</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chileans stocked up on foodstuffs,
candles, batteries and other basics before Wednesday's referendum
on right-wing Gen. August Pinochet's presidency, fearing that
violence may follow the vote.
   ``I know nothing and don't care about politics, but I don't want
to go hungry,'' said Delia Maluf, a middle-aged housewife at a
supermarket in Providencia, a fashionable residential neighborhood.
   Several supermarket managers reported a steep rise in buying in
recent days, but said the situation did not seem extreme.
   ``I'd call it worry buying, not panic buying,'' Alejandro Baeza,
manager of the Unimarc supermarket in the southern Santiago
middle-class neighborhood of La Florida, said.
   Shoppers were reported purchasing mostly non-perishable
foodstuffs, fearful they will be left without refrigerators since
blackouts are a common occurrence in Chile in times of political
tension.
   Candles, flashlights and batteries were in high demand, the
managers said. At least one manager reported his store had run out
of candles by the weekend.
   Opposition leaders and Roman Catholic Church sources said Monday
they are afraid that pro-government agents may provoke violence
during the referendum in which Pinochet seeks eight more years in
power.
   Several polls have put the opposition ahead of the former coup
leader.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesperson Phyllis Oakley
expressed the Reagan administration's ``serious concern'' over the
alleged plans to call off the balloting.
   A 16-party opposition coalition said in a written statement that
it had evidence Pinochet supporters planned ``blackouts and clashes
with the people to interfere in the delivery of (voting) results.''
   Church officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
they learned of possible plans for violence in a bid to make the
vote's results invalid.
   In addition, the military government has repeatedly warned of
purported plans by Communists and other radical leftists to trigger
disruptions on the day of the vote. But it gave assurances it will
maintain order.
   The government has also stressed the acute food shortages that
occurred during the leftist government ousted by the military in
1973, hinting that a similar situation may develop in the event of
an opposition victory in referendum voting.
   In the referendum, 7.4 million registered voters are to vote
``yes'' or ``no'' on a proposal by the military commanders that
Pinochet remain in power until 1997.
   If a majority vote ``yes,'' the 72-year-old ruler will start a
new eight-year term next March. If most vote ``no,'' an open
presidential election will be called and he must hand power over to
the winner in March 1990.
   Several shoppers in Santiago supermarkets admitted they were
worried over what may happen and were doing some emergency buying
in the stores.
   Some shopkeepers said the date _ at the beginning of the month _
may also be a factor in increased shopping activity, since most
workers were just paid their salaries. But they acknowledged the
increase was well above previous months.
   Supermakets reported sales increased from 25 to 100 percent in
recent days.
   ``Sales in our stores have doubled since mid-last week,'' said
Ivan Jara, manager of Marmentini Letelier, a chain of low-price
supermarkets with five stories in middle- and working-class
neighborhoods.
   Marta Bueno, a mother of six buying at one supermarket, said,
``Im worried, you hear so many things. I'm especially worried about
the children.'' Among other supplies, she bought six two-kilogram
(4.4 pound) cans of powdered milk.
   Lautaro Alvarez, a 44-year-old computer specialist, said he was
making additional purchases ``because if things get ugly afterward,
I don't want my wife to go out in the street.''
   Several supermarket operators said they had to reorganize their
stocking schedules, but were having no supply problems.
   ``Suppliers are speeding up deliveries when necessary,'' said
Ricardo Ulloa, executive of one of Chile's largest supermarkets. He
said his sales have gone up by 30 percent ``during the last 10 days
or so.''

   Actor Steve Guttenberg's wedding to model
Denise Bixler came much easier than his film marriage in ``Diner,''
in which his fiancee had to pass a football trivia test before he'd
marry her.
   ``No tests. Just true love,'' Guttenberg's publicist Jay
Schwartz said Monday.
   Guttenberg, 30, who also starred in ``Cocoon'' and the ``Police
Academy'' movies, married Ms. Bixler in a private, formal ceremony
Friday for a few family and friends in Plymouth, Mich.
   Ms. Bixler, who lives in Plymouth, wore a white wedding gown
with a long trail. Guttenberg wore a tuxedo with a white bow tie.
   Schwartz said he did not know the bride's age or how the couple
met.

   Singer Lena Horne says it's getting harder to
find the right material to record.
   Looking dazzling, Horne attended a party Monday for her new
album, ``The Men in My Life,'' on Three Cherries Records. It's her
first record since ``The Lady and Her Music,'' the original cast
album of her 1981 Broadway show.
   ``They selected the songs,'' she said of the recording company.
   ``I think it's tough finding songs becoming to one of my
years,'' the 71-year-old singer said.
   She said her favorite songs on the new album are ``Roundabout,''
``Joy'' and ``Look to the Rainbow.''
   The album includes duets with Sammy Davis Jr. and jazz singer

   Mariel Hemingway and her husband say they'll open a
new restaurant in Miami's Bayside Marketplace in January, and the
name was an obvious choice.
   The couple already own two upscale restaurants in New York and
one in Dallas under the name Sam's Cafe. Sam is Stephen Crisman's
nickname for his actress wife and business partner.
   On Monday, the two announced plans to open a California-style
cafe aimed at young singles in the marketplace on Biscayne Bay. The
cafe will be named Zemos, which is Hemingway's nickname for her

   ``When the location became available, we jumped at it,'' said
Crisman, who managed the Hard Rock Cafe in London in the 1970s and
opened its New York branch in 1983.

   ``I've wanted in my heart for a long time to be an American,''
Siegfried Fischbacher said following a special flag-bedecked

   ``I'm elated, very greatful, very honored,'' Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn

white and blue balloons. ``Now it is official. Being an American
means all the things we believe in.''
   Their stage show assistant, Kenyan-born Lynette Gaye Chappell,
also was sworn in as an American citizen in special ceremonies
before U.S. District Judge Lloyd George.
   George said the citizenship papers make Siegfried and Roy
Americans, but ``in a deeper sense, they have always been
Americans.''
   ``Welcome home, Siegfried and Roy,'' he said.

   Combining work with protest, actor Martin
Sheen was among 110 people arrested at the Nevada Test Site on the
birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of civil disobedience.
   About 200 protesters gathered for the nuclear weapons protest
and observance of Gandhi's 119th birthday on Sunday, said Energy
Department spokesman Chris West.
   Many protesters were arrested more than once for crossing the
test site boundary repeatedly, West said. All were cited for
misdemeanor trespass.
   The Rev. Bill O'Donnell, a Catholic priest from Berkeley,
Calif., said Sheen brought along a film crew to shoot scenes for a
movie in which the actor plays a scientist exposed to nuclear
weapons. He said the demonstation was peaceful and called it ``just
typical civil disobedience.''
   Sheen has been arrested numerous times in demonstrations at the
site where underground nuclear weapons tests are conducted.
   Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1948, advocated passive
resistance as a means of ending British rule of India.

<HEAD>Some Sizeable Price Increases Recorded in Wake of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most food prices stayed fairly level this
summer despite the drought that hammered U.S. croplands, but
sizeable increases were recorded for a few products, according to
consumer advocates.
   ``Our survey suggests that in late July and early August there
was no extensive price gouging,'' Stephen Brobeck, executive
director of Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement
released Monday. But he said there were heavy increases in June.
   The group along with Washington-based Public Voice for Food
Health and Policy released initial results of price monitoring they
said was designed ``to try to head off drought-related price
gouging.''
   The Agriculture Department has been moving to ease concern about
possible steep price increases as a result of the dry spell.
Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson has been estimating a 3 percent
to 5 percent increase in the food price index this year compared to
a forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent before the picture was altered
by the broiling sun and shortage of rainfall.
   For next year, the department has been forecasting
drought-related increases of perhaps 2 percent on top of an
expected rise of 2 percent to 4 percent in the consumer price index
for food.
   Some members of Congress have been skeptical. The General
Accounting Office has been monitoring food prices at the request of
Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   In unveiling the survey by the consumer groups, Ellen Haas,
executive director of Public Voice, said the ``first price checks
give us some reason to be concerned that some food prices may be
rising contrary to economic experts' opinions.''
   ``In particular, we question recent beef price increases and the
rapid increase in some wheat products,'' she said.
   Brobeck said ``the good news is that between July and August,
most surveyed prices stayed the same or declined.''
   ``The bad news is that 29 percent rose and typically these
increases were quite large,'' he said.
   In the survey, 14 Consumer Federation member groups monitored
prices at major supermarket chains in 16 areas of the country. The
organizations said that comparisons of two sets of prices revealed:
   _More beef prices rose than fell. Sirloin prices rose at 35
percent of the markets and declined at 25 percent of them. The
median increase was 14.1 cents a pound and the median decrease 9.0
cents. Economists say beef prices should have been falling because
skyrocketing feed prices accelerated the slaughter.
   _Milk and butter prices were raised more often than lowered in
the period, but the increases were in the range of 3 percent to 5
percent. ``Eighty percent of the stores in the sample did not
change their price of ice cream.''
   _Prices of some wheat products went up faster than expected as
did those for fresh fruits and vegetables. But median price
decreases for corn and broccoli were typically larger than
increases, even though more stores hiked them than reduced them.

   The nation's bankers are adding muscle to the
push for increased federal funding for rural development projects.
   ``Policies which encourage public and private investment in
rural America are a vital ingredient in rebuilding the economic
base of the farm community,'' American Bankers Association Murry
Lull told a recent hearing held by the congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
also has been talking up rural development and may attempt to move
legislation when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill next year.
   The Agriculture Department already pours substantial resources
into rural development and the idea of major new programs has
failed to catch fire in a time of budget retrenchment. But the
campaign for programs is building again.
   Lull, president of Smith County State Bank and Trust Co., Smith
Center, Kan., said banks ``must play a central role in this
investment process by providing credit to assist new businesses, to
encourage diversification in agricultural production and to fund
improvements in education and community infrastructure.''
   He suggested Congress consider guaranteeing loans to stimulate
rural growth and at the same time protect the nation's banks.

Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio, who is campaigning for reelection, ``is
scheduled to appear with Vautour.''
   It said the meeting is one in a series designed ``to elicit
views of local citizens on rural development issues.'' It said
Columbus was chosen as the site of the meeting ``because of its
proximity to a large number of rural communities in Ohio.''
   ``Town meetings are an excellent opportunity for me to hear
first-hand what rural Americans are doing to revitalize their local
economies,'' Vautour was quoted as saying.

   Listeners of radio station WHOS-AM may have
gone to sleep with the gospel song ``Beautiful Heaven,'' but they
woke up to ``The Devil In Disguise'' and nothing but other Elvis
Presley tunes.
   Gary Kaye said he and other station staff members were surprised
when general manager Mack Bramlett announced the immediate switch
to an all-Elvis format Monday morning. The format is similar to
that adopted recently by Cincinnati station WCVG-AM.
   ``It was just suddenly sprung on us,'' said Kaye, who was music
director under the old gospel format, but hasn't been assigned new
duties yet.
   Kaye said the 24-hour station had received favorable listener
response for its gospel music, but apparently that did not impress
advertisers.
   Bramlett was out of the office Monday and could not be reached
for comment.
   About a dozen callers Monday said they preferred the old format,
Kaye said, while more than two dozen said they liked the Elvis.
   ``For the first day, that isn't a bad response,'' he said.

   No one is going to confuse Jim Turner
with presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis, and
Turner says that's a good thing.
   Turner portrays presidential hopeful Randee of the Redwoods on
MTV, which broadcasts music videos and other programs for cable
television subscribers.
   His slogan: ``Just Say Whoa!''
   ``I'm not a very serious candidate, and it's doubtful ... that I
will be president,'' Turner said, indicating that a Turner victory
would be a bad sign of the nation's sanity.
   The 35-year-old comedian entertained about 70 students Monday on
the steps of the Old Capitol on the University of Iowa campus.
   In a slap at GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, Turner
said he ``joined the Marines to avoid the National Guard.''
   Turner also copied Dukakis' practice of reminding voters he is
the son of immigrant parents, saying his mother ``came to America
via Greece, India, Pakistan and eventually parts of Nebraska.''
   Turner was asked the date of Pearl Harbor day, which Bush
mistakenly referred to as Sept. 7.
   ``Today. Tomorrow. Every day. You know, today is the first day
of the rest of the Pearl Harbor days of the rest of your life.
Think about that,'' Turner said.

<HEAD>Defense Ministry Says Hondurans Fired On Border Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said Honduran
forces attacked a border observation post with machinegun fire and
grenade launchers in the seventh border incident reported by
Nicaragua since August.
   A ministry statement released on Monday did not mention
casualties or say whether Sandinista forces returned fire.
   It said Honduran forces attacked the border observation post in
Murupuchi in northern Nuevo Segovia province last Saturday using
``50mm machine-gun fire, FAL rifles and 10 discharges from M-79
grenade launchers.''
   There was no immediate response from Honduras.
   Acting Foreign Minister Javier Chamorro Mora on Thursday accused
Honduras of six border incursions and three violations of
Nicaraguan airspace in September.
   The Honduran Foreign Ministry denied the initial reports and
called upon the Sandinista government ``to improve the situation of
calm that in reality prevails along the border between both
countries.''
   Also Monday, a political leader of the Nicaraguan rebels
condemned a Nicaraguan government proposal to suspend the
activities of the National Reconciliation Commission until after a
meeting of Central American presidents.
   Roberto Ferrey, member of the rebel's political directorate,
said that the leftist government had ``ordered the suspension'' of
the commission, set up to verify compliance with a March 23 peace
agreement, ``because they do not run it.''
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo heads the
commission, which includes representatives from the government and
Nicaragua's domestic opposition. It also monitors compliance with
the regional peace agreement signed in August 1987.
   On Saturday, Vice President Sergio Ramirez proposed that the
commission suspend further meetings until after a summit meeting of
the five Central American presidents, tentatively scheduled for
November.
   In a letter to Obando y Bravo, Ramirez said the commission
``lacks precise definitions'' and protested an August visit to
Miami by two opposition representatives on the commission to meet
with rebel officials.
   Ramirez said that visit was made without the approval of the
government.
   On Sunday, Obando y Bravo said he would ``reflect'' on Ramirez's
proposal but noted that the commission could continue its work
``without waiting for the presidents to meet.''
   Ferrey told The Associated Press in Miami that the government
wanted to suspend commission activity in order ``to curtail
Cardinal Obando's voice as a witness to the regime's constant
violations of the Esquipulas II accords.''
   The U.S.-backed rebels and the government halted offensive
military operations on March 21 and concluded a temporary
cease-fire agreement two days later. But each side accuses the
other of frequent violations, and high-level negotiations on a
permanent truce to the 7-year-old civil war reached a stalemate on
June 9.

   West Germans concerned about Soviet popularity
among their fellow citizens have launched a campaign to convince
young people on both sides of the Atlantic of the value of
U.S.-West European ties.
   German-American efforts to bridge differences since World War II
and stand up to Soviet aggression in Europe have been ``an
unbelievable success story,'' Guenter Diehl, former Bonn government
spokesman and diplomat, told key members of Congress on Monday.
   However, Diehl said, younger Germans appear oblivious to the
importance of the accomplishments.
   ``Things that we have done are taken for granted,'' including
the establishment of freedom in much of Western Europe, he said.
   ``The United States is carrying a tremendous burden'' by
continuing to station 200,000 troops in Germany, said Johannes
Steinhoff, a decorated Luftwaffe fighter pilot during World War II
who subsequently served as an adviser to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Even though Europeans contribute to their own defense, U.S.
support is vital, Steinhoff said.
   Steinhoff said there is little appreciation among young people
for the daring and sacrifice of the American airlift that broke the
1948-49 Soviet attempt to cut off West Berlin from Western Europe.
   Diehl and Steinhoff, at a luncheon, announced a newspaper
advertising campaign in West Germany and the United States under
the slogan ``Friendship in Freedom.''
   The ads, featuring criticism of the Communist-built Berlin Wall
and praise for NATO for fostering peace and prosperity in Western
Europe, are aimed at both young people and at reassuring their
parents who may be suffering from doubts in the wake of Soviet
public-relations successes.
   The ads are to start Oct. 11.
   ``This initiative was founded by concerned citizens who, after
suffering dictatorship and war, came to experience the values of
friendship in a very personal way,'' said a statement from the
group.
   Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Europe, said he had been startled by public opinion
poll results from West Germany indicating widespread belief that
the Soviet Union, rather than the United States, was the peacemaker
in Europe.
   Polls in West Germany also show that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev draws far more favorable ratings among the general public
than President Reagan.
   ``Gorby, as we like to call him, ... has been making a
disarmament proposals every two months'' and appealing to a natural
human desire for change, said Diehl.
   Gorbachev is following an old Soviet strategy of trying to
neutralize Germany, he said.
   But, Diehl said, the Soviets have problems in their public
relations because of the vast deployment their forces in East
Germany, estimated at 380,000 troops. No one believes the Soviet
claim that they are there to defend against an attack from the
West, he said.
   Among the founding members of ``Freundshaft in Freiheit''
(Friendship in Freedom) were Diehl, the chairman; department store
owner Alphons Horten, vice chairman, and banker Gernot Ernst,
treasurer.

<TEXT>
   Ramon Durano, a former
congressman, business leader and one of the country's most colorful
politicians, has died of cancer, his family announced. He was 82.
   Durano, who died Monday, virtually owned Danao, a city of 60,000
north of Cebu. Many Danao residents were born in Durano's hospital,
worked in his factories, retired to his home for the elderly and
were buried in his cemetery.
   Durano was born Dec. 24, 1905 to a prosperous Cebu family. He
was elected to the House of Representatives from Cebu in 1949 and
served until President Ferdinand Marcos abolished the legislature
in 1972.
   In January, Durano was elected mayor of Danao, defeating his son
Thaddaeus in a bitter campaign.
   Durano was a longtime rival of the Osmena family, Cebu's other
major political dynasty. Election battles between the two clans
were often marked by violence and allegations of massive
vote-buying on all sides.
   In his autobiography, Durano described himself as a political
realist.
   ``I must say that like a determined boxer in the ring, a
politician must know how to defend himself, know his opponent's
weak and strong points and slug it out as expected of him,'' Durano
said.
   During his term in Congress, Durano was involved in at least
four fistfights with rivals on the House floor.
   He remained a devoted follower of Marcos, describing him in his
autobiography as the greatest leader the Philippines ever produced.
   He is survived by his wife Beatriz, three daughters and two sons.

<HEAD>BBC Delays TV Documentary On Anti-Terrorist Army Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. has delayed
transmission of a television documentary about Britain's elite
anti-terrorist army unit that was to have been aired Monday night.
   The film will be broadcast ``in the coming weeks'' after changes
are made, said a BBC spokesman.
   It was approved by eight senior executives and lawyers in the
BBC's news and current affairs team, but was withdrawn Saturday
night after BBC Director General Michael Checkland and his deputy,
John Birt, decided it needed more work, a BBC spokesman said.
   The documentary on the top-secret Special Air Services, or SAS,
was pegged to last month's inquest into the March 6 killings by SAS
commandos of three unarmed Irish Republican Army members in the
British colony of Gibraltar, the BBC said.
   The trio were on a car-bomb mission, and a Gibraltar coroner's
jury in Gibraltar ruled Friday that the killings were lawful.
   Checkland and Birt were ``happy with the themes the program
addresses but they feel more work is needed to prepare it for
transmission,'' said the spokesman, requesting anonymity. He would
not say what changes were envisaged.
   The program by ``Panorama,'' the BBC's premier current affairs
show, ``considers the issues raised by the Gibraltar inquest but
examines the accountability of the SAS primarily in Northern
Ireland,'' the spokesman said.
   The government has denied IRA claims that it operates an
officially sanctioned ``shoot-to-kill'' policy against IRA suspects.
   The program examined the rules of law and engagement of army and
SAS soldiers in Northern Ireland, and interviewed an SAS officer
who explains the soldier's dilemmas in facing a guerrilla.

<HEAD>Reagan Textile Veto Headed for House Challenge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's veto of textile and apparel
import curbs is headed for a test of muscle in the House with bill
opponents and supporters both ready for a battle.
   ``We have the best chance that we've ever had'' for a veto
override, Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said Monday. But he added,
``I'm not sure'' textile forces have galvanized enough support in
the face of an energetic administration lobbying campaign.
   Bill supporters planned to initiate their override attempt today.
   Reagan described the bill as ``protectionism at its worst'' and
vetoed it on Sept. 28. Industry supporters are now attempting to
override that veto and pass the bill into law over the president's
objections.
   Designed to protect American industry from foreign competition,
the bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels
this year and limit growth to 1 percent annually thereafter.
   It also would freeze nonrubber footwear imports at 1987 levels
with no provision for growth later. It would guarantee higher
quotas to countries that buy American farm goods, establish a
one-year pilot program under which the government would auction off
import licenses and create a special quota for foreign-made silk
neckties.
   Textile forces would have to rally two-thirds of the lawmakers
present and voting to their side to be successful in their override
effort. If they succeeded in doing so in the House, they would then
have to repeat the accomplishment in the Senate.
   Reagan vetoed a similar measure in 1985 and the House the
following August was unable to muster the two-thirds needed to
override. Indeed, the industry has never been able to obtain such a
margin in years of skirmishing.
   Critics of the legislation say they are completely confident
there will be no override of the president's veto.
   ``I think it will be sustained,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,
the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's trade
subcommittee and one of the fiercest critics of the legislation.
   ``It's a lousy, stinking bill that we've voted on five times
already,'' Gibbons said in a telephone interview Monday night.
``It's a lousy, stinking piece of selfish economics.''
   He said the bill is being kept alive by ``a lobby that lives on
the myth that foreign competition is driving them out of business.''
   Sponsors of the measure point to a 17 percent growth in imports
since the start of the decade and add that the situation is getting
worse. They say 29,000 jobs were lost in the textile and apparel
industries last year while textile producers' earnings sank 12
percent in the first quarter of 1988.
   Opponents say the industry already is heavily protected by 1,400
quotas covering 42 countries and that earnings were up 9 percent
last year with 21,000 new jobs created in an industry that is just
emerging from a wave of modernization. They say import restraints
would merely trigger retaliation against U.S. exports while raising
prices and narrowing consumer choices.
   The final round of the long-running battle is being fought
against a backdrop of presidential and congressional elections in
the textile-producing areas of the South. It is punctuated by
warnings from some of the bill's sponsors that voters fearful of
losing textile industry jobs will exact a price at the polls for
the veto.
   In any case, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., has already said
that if the override effort fails he will introduce a new version
of the import restrictions next year.

<TEXT>
   Threats from Tamil separatists have
succeeded in stopping anyone from filing nomination papers for
provincial elections in the northern and eastern provinces of Sri
Lanka, election officials said.
   In addition, six of the government's eight administrative
offices in the north and east did not function Monday after Tamil
militants threatened officials not to open offices, deputy
Elections Commissioner Lakshman Silva said.
   Tamil radicals shot and injured V.K. Sivagnanam, special
commissioner of the Jaffna Municipal Council, and killed two
civilians in Jaffna, 200 miles northeast of the capital Colombo, a
Tamil journalist said.
   He said the two Tamils died in clashes between rebel militant
groups in front of Jaffna hospital.
   Sivagnanam was attacked by members of the most militant Tamil
group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, when he was in his office,
the journalist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Tamil militants have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent state in the north and east of the island since 1983.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of the
island's 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by
the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population and control the administration and military.
   Elections to provincial councils in the north and east of the
island, where Tamils are in a majority, form part of an
India-brokered peace agreement signed in July 1987 to end the
island's ethnic war.
   Tamil militants initially agreed but later reneged on terms of
the agreement.
   Monday was the first day for nominations to be filed to elect 71
representatives to the northern and eastern provincial councils.
Elections are scheduled for later this year.
   Election offices in northeast Trincomalee town and eastern
Ampara town were open Monday to receive nominations despite threats
from Tamil militants. Deputy Election Commissioner Silva said no
nominations were received.

<HEAD>Democratic Officials Say Veep Qualifications Not Debate Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic strategists say the public will
decide that Lloyd Bentsen is a better candidate than Republican Dan
Quayle even if he has trouble getting that across in Wednesday
night's vice presidential debate.
   ``Most people have already decided that Bentsen is more
qualified than Quayle. I don't really believe that's the issue of
this debate,'' said George Christian, former press secretary to
President Johnson and a long-time Bentsen adviser.
   Christian was one of about a dozen people prepping Bentsen
Monday at an Austin hotel for his meeting with Quayle. Bentsen
planned to travel to the debate city of Omaha, Neb., tonight.
   Bentsen was kept mostly away from reporters. His only public
appearance Monday came when he tossed around a football with some
former University of Texas stars at a picture session for the news
media.
   ``I think we're relaxed for it. I think we're ready for it,''
Bentsen said. Was he nervous? ``I'm not nervous,'' he said.
   His staff, while expressing great confidence in Bentsen, said he
was stuck with the burden of expectations for Quayle that are so
low, and Quayle is so telegenic, that Bentsen can't win.
   ``We have enormous confidence that while Dan Quayle has good
television skills ... when it comes to the judgement of which of
these two men, Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle, and which of these two
tickets is best qualified'' Bentsen as the advantage, said Susan
Estrich, campaign manager for the Democratic ticket.
   ``Sure, I expect that Sen. Quayle will acquit himself reasonably
well in this debate format,'' Christian said. ``But I don't think
that's going to detract from the fact that Sen. Bentsen is far more
qualified by experience and judgment ... to be a better vice
president than Dan Quayle.''
   Campaign press secretary Mike McCurry expressed dissatisfaction
with what he said would be a low standard for measuring Quayle's
success.
   ``We'd hope the high bar would be set a little higher than being
passively coherent for 90 minutes,'' he said.
   Bentsen held a dress rehearsal for the debate on Monday, with
Rep. Dennis Eckart playing Quayle and staffers playing reporters.
He planned to work most of today, and part of Wednesday, reviewing
and working on strategy for the session, McCurry said.
   ``He's clearly very comfortable with the substance of his
answers,'' said McCurry.
   Estrich, McCurry and others said one of the biggest efforts was
to get Bentsen to boil down his statements to fit into the
restricting format of a television debate. But not a lot of time
was spent concocting ``one-liners,'' they said.
   ``I think one thing we found in the last debate, frankly, is
that the one-liners were not what made the difference for those
watching the debate,'' said Estrich.

   Rep. Pat Swindall has made the unusual move of
requesting that he be indicted ``on all charges that may be under
consideration'' by a grand jury in Atlanta that is investigating
drug money laundering.
   Swindall, a Republican seeking his third term in Congress from
the suburban Atlanta 4th District, said he made the request Monday
in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh because news
reports based on unnamed federal sources have made it impossible to
defend himself.
   ``Simple justice and fairness demand that I be allowed to prove
my innocence in a court of law rather than in the media,'' Swindall
said. ``Simple justice and fairness also demand that I be allowed
to prove my innocence before rather than after the Nov. 8
elections.''
   Swindall, who is locked in a tight re-election battle with
Democrat Ben Jones, said he told Thornburgh he is ``ready, able and
willing to go to trial on the day following the indictment which I
now request.''
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Thornburgh would
have no response to Swindall's request beyond a statement U.S.
Attorney Robert Barr issued Friday in Atlanta after Swindall
criticized the investigation and suggested it might be politically
motivated.
   Barr said decisions by his office and grand juries in his
district ``have never been, are not, and will never be influenced
or made on the basis of statements by or pressures from third
parties, including persons who may be subjects of investigations.''
   He said Swindall ``is free to make any statement he desires,''
but ``all decisions of this office will continue to be handled
according to well established principles of law.''
   Swindall first was linked publicly to the federal money
laundering investigation earlier this year when it was disclosed
that his Aug. 28, 1987 meeting with an undercover federal agent
posing as a money launderer for underworld figures had been
videotaped.
   Swindall was introduced to the undercover agent by Charles
LeChasney, a former Atlanta businessman who was active in
Republican circles. LeChasney was indicted in January on multiple
money-laundering charges stemming from the federal investigation.
   Swindall testified before the grand jury in February, but he has
not been charged with a crime.
   In June, Atlanta newspapers obtained several tape recordings
from the investigation and published excerpts from a series of
conversations between Swindall, LeChasney and the undercover agent.
   The tapes showed that Swindall continued to pursue negotiations
for a $850,000 home construction loan after being told it might be
financed with drug money he would be helping to launder. He ended
the negotiations after being told he would have to accept the money
in person in cash and sign a receipt.
   Swindall later apologized for his role in the negotiations,
calling it a mistake in judgement. But he denied any wrongdoing and
vowed to continue seeking re-election.
   He also asked the House ethics committee to determine if he had
violated any law or House rule. The panel agreed to investigate,
but has not issued a ruling.

<HEAD>Prospects For Child Legislation Look Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects appear bleak for enactment of a
legislative package promising parental job leaves, child care and a
crackdown on child pornographers, despite its survival of a
critical test in the Senate.
   Republicans loath to take responsibility for killing the
``children's agenda'' joined Democrats Monday in voting to allow
the Senate to proceed with action on the package.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told his GOP colleagues they would
have other chances to halt the triple-barrelled package.
   ``Anyone who wants to stop the process can do so,'' he said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said drug abuse and
tax corrections bills are more urgent priorities for Congress to
complete before it adjourns in a week or two.
   But Dole added, ``I don't want tomorrow morning's headlines to
report that Republicans are frustrating the efforts of Democrats on
child care legislation ... or parental leave.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sponsor of two of the three
parts of the package, said strengthening the family could help
lessen drug problems among children later in their lives. And he
described the tax bill as little more than a candy store filled
with corporate goodies.
   ``I'm a recipient of some of those goodies in my state, but
you'll never convince me that that bill is more important than
parental leave or child care,'' Dodd said.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was trying
to get an agreement for quick action on the children's package
despite a multitude of GOP amendments in the wings.
   The elements of the package include:
   _Dodd's parental and medical leave bill guaranteeing employees
of firms with more than 50 workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid,
job-protected leave on the birth, adoption or serious illness of a
child, or the serious illness of the employee. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and other business interests opposed to mandated benefits
are waging a fierce drive against the bill.
   _A child pornography and obscenity measure creating new crimes
and punishments in those areas in order to help prosecutors crack
down on people who sell, distribute, produce or possess such
materials. Sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., it was added
to the Dodd measure 97-0 last week.
   _A $2.5 billion child care bill aimed at helping low-income
Americans pay for child care; expanding the supply of child care;
and assuring minimum standards of health, safety, staff training
and staff ratios at child care homes and centers. A compromise
reached by Hatch and Dodd, it would later include an increase in
the earned income tax credit for poor families.
   Once approved, the package would have to go the House. If the
House didn't pass the same version, negotiators would have to work
out the differences. But Byrd insisted there was still time for the
children's bills to clear the 100th Congress, due to adjourn this
weekend or next weekend.

<HEAD>Energy Department Switches Stance On Nuclear Plant Accident
Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy, in a turnaround,
acknowledged it had received reports from Du Pont Co. about nuclear
reactor accidents at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina
over a 28-year period.
   On Friday, department officials had said they hadn't known about
the accidents.
   C. Anson Franklin, assistant secretary for congressional,
intergovernmental and public affairs at the Energy Department, said
Monday that Du Pont had notified the Energy Department and its
predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, of the incidents.
   ``The issue here was whether some information had been withheld
from the Department of Energy, and there had been some suggestions
that it had been,'' Franklin said. ``We looked into that today and
found that any such suggestions would be incorrect.''
   The New York Times reported in today's editions on the new
Energy Department positions.
   The safety of the Savannah River reactors, operated by Du Pont
for the Department of Energy, came under heavy criticism at a
congressional hearing Friday.
   A 1985 memorandum disclosed at the hearing listed 30 incidents
at the five Savannah River reactors between 1957 and 1985. They
included one in which fuel rods melted and another in which a chain
reaction nearly went out of control.
   Energy Department officials said Friday that they had not been
aware of the series of incidents. But Du Pont issued a statement
Sunday saying it had notified the government of the incidents
through ``the formal reactor incident reporting system.''
   Du Pont said it has provided daily and monthly operations
reports to DOE; maintained a formal reactor incident reporting
system since 1957; provided semiannual summary reports of reactor
incidents to Du Pont and DOE management for the past 20 years; and
shared reactor incident report information with the news media.
   Franklin said the reports on the incidents were filed with the
regional office in Aiken, S.C., but the information apparently
never got to the energy secretary or other top energy officials in
Washington.
   ``It's hard to say at this point, this many years after the
events, how the information was handled at the Department of
Energy,'' Franklin said.
   Asked whether such a problem could occur today, Franklin said,
``All significant incidents would be reported to headquarters.''

   With Discovery back from the first
post-Challenger mission, NASA is aiming to accelerate its launch
schedule to 14 flights by 1993, when it hopes to begin building a
space station.
   But the agency insists it will never again put schedules ahead
of safety.
   The Rogers Commission that investigated the Challenger explosion
in 1986 criticized NASA for putting too much pressure on itself to
meet a tight launch schedule and said that could lead to lapses in
safety.
   ``The shuttle missions are booked up to the horizon,'' shuttle
director Richard Truly said following Discovery's return to Earth
on Monday. ``Our job is to safely build the launch rate up so we
can meet that challenge.
   ``But if we find it's not safe to launch 14, we won't do it,''
he said.
   The next shuttle flight is set for late November, when Atlantis
will be launched on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Seven flights are planned next year, 10 in 1990, 9 in 1991 and
13 in 1992.
   Starting in 1993, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration hopes to launch the first of 22 flights over four
years to carry up segments of a permanent manned space station.
   The schedules in 1992 and beyond will require a fourth shuttle
now being built to replace Challenger, destroyed in an explosion 32
months ago.
   Discovery's flight received intense worldwide attention because
it was the first post-Challenger mission. It will be far different
for the Atlantis liftoff in late November.
   Because the spacecraft will be carrying a classified Defense
Department payload, the Pentagon will try to shroud it in as much
secrecy as possible. But as officials learned on two earlier
military shuttle missions, it's difficult to do that when thousands
of people who are used to an open NASA policy work on a program
that is highly visible.
   Discovery will be returned here Sunday, ferried atop a Boeing
747 jetliner, to be readied for a flight scheduled for Feb. 18. It
will carry a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite identical to one
deployed from its cargo bay six hours after launch last Thursday.
   Here is the rest of NASA's schedule for 1989:
   April 28: Crew of Atlantis to dispatch the Magellan spacecraft
which is to orbit Venus and map its surface.
   July 1: Columbia on a classified Defense Department mission.
   Aug. 10: Discovery on a classified Defense Department mission.
   Oct. 12: Crew of Atlantis to dispatch the Galileo spacecraft to
orbit the planet Jupiter and drop a scientific probe into its
atmosphere.
   Nov. 13: Crew of Columbia to deploy a communications satellite
and retrieve for return to Earth a research satellite placed in
orbit on a 1984 shuttle mission.
   Dec. 11: Discovery on a classified Defense Department mission.

<HEAD>Deaver Files Appeal of Conviction for Lying to Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver has
filed a formal appeal of his conviction that he lied under oath
when questioned by a grand jury and a House subcommittee about his
lobbying activities.
   The former deputy White House chief of staff was given a
suspended three-year sentence and a $100,000 fine last month by
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   The judge also ordered Deaver to perform 1,500 hours of
community service and barred him from lobbying the federal
government for pay during a three-year period the former White
House aide was placed on probation.
   The formal notice of appeal, signed by Deaver and his lawyer,
Herbert J. Miller Jr., was filed Monday in U.S. District Court.

<HEAD>Most Americans Favor More Fuel-Efficient Cars, Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two-thirds of Americans believe they will see
another energy crisis that will bring back gasoline lines, but
nearly 75 percent oppose a gasoline tax increase to discourage
consumption, according to a poll commissioned by environmentalists.
   The survey released Monday also found that 90 percent of
Americans believe the government should require automakers to build
cars that are more fuel-efficient.
   When asked if cars should be required to average 45 miles per
gallon in the year 2000, a position some environmental groups have
endorsed, the poll respondents split 82-15 in favor.
   The Analysis Group Inc., a New Haven, Conn.-based polling firm,
telephoned 1,000 registered voters from Sept. 10-14 for The
Communications Consortium, a public relations firm representing
environmental groups. The margin of error in the poll is about
three percentage points.

<HEAD>Many Pesticides Undetected in Food Supply, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research arm of Congress says federal
agencies charged with checking the nation's food supply can't
detect half the pesticides permitted to be used.
   The Office of Technology Assessment reported Monday that the
government's testing methods can only detect 163 of the 316 active
pesticide ingredients that are allowed in limited quantities.
   Diane Baxter, staff scientist for the National Coalition Against
the Misuse of Pesticides, said the lack of coverage in routine
monitoring ``worries us very much.''
   Food is checked by the Food Safety Inspection Service of the
Agriculture Department, which analyzes meat and poultry; the
department's Agricultural Marketing Service, which analyzes eggs;
and the Food and Drug Administration, part of the Health and Human
Services Department, which analyzes all other foods.

   Laotian police have arrested two
Americans who had planned to float several thousand U.S. dollars
down the Mekong River in hopes of finding American soldiers they
believe are still being held in Communist Indochina, according to
the U.S. Embassy and one of the Americans.
   Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said the two were being held at
Ban Sing Samphan in the southern province Laotian of Champasak.
   ``We have advised our embassy in Vientiane of the arrest and our
embassy is checking with Lao authorities to determine what has
transpired,'' Petzing said.
   Donna Long, one of the two Americans, told the Associated Press
Sunday that they planned to drop plastic bags containing U.S.
dollars bills and other currencies into the Mekong River and to
pass out money in villages along the Laotian bank. Long revealed
the plan on condition it would not be released until the two
returned or were captured.
   Each bill was stamped with a message offering a $2.4 million
reward to anyone who could bring an American prisoner of war to the
International Red Cross.
   Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel manager, said Monday that
Long and the other American, who asked not to be identified, had
been captured by Laotian authorities.
   The Mekong forms a boundary with Thailand and then flows on to
both Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The reward money to any Cambodian, Laotian or Vietnamese is
being offered through the National Steering Committee for American
War Veterans, a private MIA-POW group. The group says the $2.4
million has been pledged by 21 congressmen and the American Defense
Institute, another group concerned with the MIA issue.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
from the Indochina War in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three
Indochinese governments deny that any Americans are alive in their
countries but some private American groups disagree.
   In 1987, several MIA-POW activists, including relatives of MIAs,
floated balloons down the Mekong River from the Thai shore with
offers of the $2.4 million reward, but with no known result.
   Members of the committee, including chairman Ted Sampley, were
scheduled to arrive in Thailand on Wednesday.
   Pornthipa, a manager at Ubon's Phatum Rat Hotel, said the two
had sought assistance in getting to the river and the hotel felt
obliged to help them.
   Long, 45, of Jacksonville, N.C., said they expected to travel
from Ubon to Khong Chaim on the banks of the Mekong and then
northward along the river to a Thai fishing village where they
could hire a boat to take them across to the Laotian shore.
   Petzing said the two were seized across from the Thai district
of Khong Chiam in an area where the Mun River flows into the Mekong.
   Long described herself as a ``POW-MIA activist'' whose now
deceased husband served three combat tours in Vietnam. In 1972 she
said she began wearing a bracelet inscribed with the name of Gary
La Bohn, a U.S. Special Forces sergeant who is listed as missing in
action in Laos in 1968.

   Soldiers of the Interior Ministry are delivering
food, repairing buildings and working fields in Nagorno-Karabakh,
where Armenians remain on strike to press ethnic demands, Tass
reported.
   In a Monday dispatch, the news agency said industrial
enterprises are closed. Public transportation and freight hauling
also remain shut down with the exception of a few taxi services, it
said.
   The soldiers ``deliver foodstuffs to Stepanakert and rural areas
of the region, protect water intake facilities, repair and
modernize the premises in which they have been temporarily
quartered,'' it said.
   ``Besides, at farmers' request soldiers help a number of farms
with agricultural work,'' the dispatch said.
   Tass said the strike continuted to paralyze Stepanakert, the
major city of Nagorno-Karabakh, but that farm work was being done
in rural areas.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian region, is part of
the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan but residents have been agitating
since February for annexation by the neighboring Armenian republic.
   Armenia has supported the demands, but Azerbaijan and the
central government have rejected them.
   Shooting incidents, arson and other acts of violence that broke
out in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sept. 18 led to deployment of the
soldiers, a curfew and a ban on public meetings.
   Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic rioting in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at the end of February and beginning of
March.

   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices edged down on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 133.15 yen, down 0.75 yen from Monday's
close of 133.90 yen. After opening at 133.37 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 133.00 and 133.43 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost another 44.51 points or
0.16 percent, following Monday's 154.60-point loss, to close at
27,501.02. The index lost 134.42 points at the end of the morning
session but recovered somewhat in the afternoon.
   ``The Dow Jones' lower close overnight (in New York) initially
set the tone of the Tokyo trading,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities.
   Despite good economic factors around the market that should
increase share prices, the Nikkei remained lower due to ``shrinking
investment motivation,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The gloomy atmosphere all over Japan has made participants
pessimistic,'' the dealer said, referring to Japanese Emperor
Hirohito's serious illness.
   Other dealers said the index began recovering as participants
bought steels, but uncertainty remained in the market before the
release of U.S. unemployment figures that encouraged participants
to stay on the sidelines.
   The U.S. unemployment rate for September is to come out Friday.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 950 million
shares.
   ``The dollar fell in trading that was dominated by
dollar-selling,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa with the Daiwa Bank in
Tokyo.
   ``Institutional investors did not buy as much dollars as we
thought, and the currency kept falling,'' he said, adding that
market participants also became cautious as the release of the U.S.
unemployment figures approaches.

<HEAD>State Trooper Cleared Of Raping Girls Says Colleagues Still
Suspect Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he retired from the State
Police last December, Lt. Robert L. Beadle was a 23-year veteran
with expertise in child abuse cases.
   Four months later, he found himself on the other side of the
fence, charged with raping two girls, one 11 years old, the other
13.
   Two juries acquitted Beadle in August and September, but the
verdicts haven't ended his personal trial.
   Beadle, 52, says being accused of the very crime he dedicated
part of his life to solving will always haunt him.
   ``The only way I'm going to clear my name is to go out and catch
the guy who committed these crimes, and I've already started my
investigation,'' he said in an interview Friday at his home in this
northern Michigan city.
   State police investigators say that although the case is closed,
they still have serious questions about Beadle, who also has faced
two indecent exposure charges in the past year.
   ``I still believe he's the culprit,'' Detective Lt. Richard N.
Coleman said at State Police headquarters in Lansing.
   Beadle became a suspect in the rapes last November after he was
involved in a car accident. Troopers investigating the accident,
who worked with him in Traverse City, found a composite sketch of
the rape suspect in his car and thought it odd because the rapes
occurred 200 miles to the southeast in Lapeer County.
   Beadle said the sketch was given to him by the commander of a
state police post in Caro, who asked Beadle to be on the lookout
for the suspect while visiting relatives in Lapeer County. His
claim was upheld at trial.
   The troopers also noticed a resemblance between the sketch and
Beadle, and asked him to be photographed for a photo lineup. Both
girls independently identified Beadle as their assailant from the
lineup.
   ``When I retired, I thought I was cleared,'' Beadle said. ``I
was shocked when they called me up a few months later and said they
had two three-count warrants waiting for me.
   ``You can't imagine the humiliation of having to go down to the
same police post where I had gone in as an expert in police report
writing and now going in to be (finger)printed and mugged with
everybody staring at me, saying, `How could you do such a horrible
thing to two little girls?'''
   Beadle claims the other individuals in the photo lineups looked
nothing like the description the girls gave of their assailant
after the rapes in October 1986 and April 1987.
   Police deny that, but concede Beadle's photo was the only one
that appeared in both lineups.
   Besides the victims' identification, there was little else to
connect Beadle to the crimes. Several witnesses, most of them
relatives, testified that Beadle was at home on the weekends of the
attacks.
   The Lapeer County prosecutor declined to comment, but State
Police detectives in charge of the case said they believed both
juries would have convicted Beadle had there been evidence placing
him in Lapeer County.
   ``We had two eyewitnesses that say he is the one that assaulted
them and the law says in a rape situation that's enough,''
detective Sgt. Chet Wilson said.
   Beadle said he retired in December because he was frustrated
with his job.
   Two months earlier he was charged with exposing himself to two
young girls near a school in Portage in southern Michigan. He
pleaded no contest in January to a reduced charge of disorderly
obscene conduct and paid a $1,000 fine, Kalamazoo County Prosecutor
Mark Courtade said.
   In February, Beadle was charged with indecent exposure in
Wexford County, which is near Traverse City. The charge was dropped
due to insufficient evidence and the pending charges in Lapeer,
Prosecutor David Hogg said.
   Beadle's defense attorney, Roger Wotila, said Beadle was
undergoing counseling at the time the rape charges were brought
against him, but declined to elaborate.
   Beadle's wife, Shirley, 54, and three daughters have stuck by
him throughout the ordeal. Some 80 friends have written letters of
support, but others have turned their backs on the family.

   A crowd approaching half a
million people, the second-largest ever to witness a shuttle
landing, became mired in a traffic jam of galactic proportions as
they headed home after Discovery's triumphant return.
   An estimated 109,000 cars, motor homes, trailers and trucks
carrying about 410,000 Discovery watchers churned clouds of
talcum-fine dust into the desert air Monday as they inched toward
the only exit from the public viewing area.
   It took vehicles 4{ hours or longer to cover the mile to the
exit from the dry lakebed. From there, traffic crawled along a
two-lane blacktop road at 20 mph.
   In addition to the huge crowd at the public viewing area, Air
Force spokesman Lt. Col. George Neiss estimated another 15,000 to
20,000 viewers watched the landing at a separate VIP section,
bringing the total crowd to 425,000 or more.
   The only larger crowd to watch a shuttle land was on July 4,
1982, when an estimated 500,000 turned out as President and Nancy
Reagan greeted Columbia.
   ``This is crazy,'' said Ellery Sabin, 66, who drove his 33-foot
motor home from Ludington, Mich., to see the landing on the Mojave
Desert floor. ``I've been around crowds, but this is really
something.''
   Like many shuttle watchers, he said Discovery's return would
reinvigorate America's space program.
   ``There's such a sense of pride here,'' Sabin said.
   Two sonic booms announced the shuttle's return at 9:34 a.m.,
eliciting gasps and screams from the crowd.
   ``It sends chills up my spine,'' said 26-year-old Steve Bestwick
of Port Hueneme.
   Vice President George Bush, California Gov. George Deukmejian
and famed pilot Chuck Yeager also were on hand to welcome
Discovery's crew home.
   Commander Rick Hauck noted that since waking up Monday, he had
circled the globe eight times and crossed the coast of California
at 120,000 feet and traveling eight times the speed of sound.
   Then he turned to the first man to break the sound barrier and
said, ``Eat your heart out, Chuck Yeager.''

   Discovery lost six
heat-shield tiles and sustained some ``dings'' during its four-day
mission, one of the most successful flights in the shuttle program,
NASA officials said.
   Work on the shuttle continued today in a round-the-clock effort
to prepare the orbiter for its return to Cape Canaveral, Fla., and
its next trip into space. The piggyback ride home aboard a modified
Boeing 747 is scheduled for Saturday.
   Discovery landed Monday morning on the hard clay bed of Rogers
Dry Lake at this Mojave Desert air base, capping a nearly flawless
flight that was America's first manned space mission since the
Challenger tragedy in 1986.
   ``Six tiles on the right wing are missing. They were no problem
_ not critical,'' said Ted Ayers, deputy site manager for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dryden Flight
Research Facility here.
   ``Everything's great'' because lost tiles only pose a danger if
they are in an area that undergoes intense heating during re-entry,
Ayers said.
   ``We've got some normal dings in the tile under the vehicle,''
he added. ``These are nicks from dirt particles on the lakebed.''
   Preliminary inspection showed no damage to the shuttle's landing
gear, tires or brakes, which were improved because of brake and
tire damage during previous missions, he said.
   Ayers said the shuttle took 7,451 feet to roll to a stop when it
landed at 9:37 a.m. Monday.
   After hours of initial work on the lakebed, a vehicle towed the
Discovery to the area where NASA workers began preparing it for its
return to Florida.
   Some of the first efforts included removing experiments from the
shuttle and shipping them to researchers around the nation, Ayers
said.
   NASA shuttle boss Richard Truly said earlier Monday that he
walked around the shuttle after it landed.
   ``It looks beautiful,'' he said. ``There is not a lot of tile
work to be done.''
   Discovery Commander Rick Hauck said that during the flight, the
shuttle ``was like a well-oiled machine.''
   Tasks to prepare Discovery for the trip home include
deactivating fuel cells, photographing tile damage and replacing
missing tiles, purging main engines and orbital maneuvering
engines, attaching locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering,
and lifting the orbiter 60 feet in a ``mate-demate'' device that
places it atop the Boeing jet.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Leader Offers Cease-Fire, Prisoner Swap With Cubans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi offered to halt
armed attacks on the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola if
Cuba ceased hostilities against his forces, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Savimbi, head of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, also proposed a swap of Cuban and UNITA
prisoners taken in the rebels' 13-year-old civil war against the
Marxist government in Luanda, according to a UNITA press statement
reported by the BBC on Monday.
   The statement quoted from a radio broadcast in which Savimbi
urged Cuba to pressure the Angolan government to negotiate directly
with the rebels ``for the formation of a government of national
unity in Angola.''
   Savimbi, whose South African military allies withdrew from
Angola last month as part of a U.S.-sponsored regional peace
settlement, has said he fears a Cuban-Angolan offensive will
destroy his strongholds in the southeastern portion of the country.
   ``It would be bad if Cuban troops, who came to Angola under the
pretext of being internationalists, are one day branded as
colonialists ... who came to replace the Portuguese to kill
defenseless Angolans,'' the BBC quoted Savimbi as saying.
   The Angolan government took power with Cuban assistance after
Portugal withdrew from the country in the mid-1970s. It has since
refused to talk with the UNITA rebels.
   UNITA, backed by South Africa and the United States, is not
party to peace talks in Brazzaville, Congo, among Angola, South
Africa and Cuba.
   Pretoria has called on Cuba to join it in a total troop
withdrawal and has held out the promise of independence for
Namibia, or South West Africa, which South Africa has ruled since
World War I. The Angolan government has insisted that the Cubans
remain for four years.
   ``A revolutionary government such as that of Cuba cannot say
that its forces are in Angola to fight against South African troops
... when the South Africans are no longer in Angola,'' the BBC
quoted Savimbi as saying.

   Indian Foreign Secretary K.P.S. Menon arrived
today for talks expected to pave the way for the first Sino-Indian
summit in 28 years.
   Indian Embassy officials, speaking on condition of anonymity
said bilateral issues, including a proposed visit by Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, will be on the agenda during Menon's five-day stay in
Beijing.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency, in an earlier report from
New Delhi, said Gandhi would come to China before the end of the
year.
   Relations between the world's two most populous nations have
long been cool because of India's pro-Soviet slant, China's close
ties with Indian rival Pakistan and an unresolved border dispute.
   The disagreement over large tracts of mountainous, sparsely
populated land along the 2,400-mile border erupted into fighting in
1962 and has been a primary source of strain since.
   Border talks begun in 1981 have been largely fruitless, but the
two sides now appear ready to play down the territorial issue in
the interest of better all-round relations.
   ``The Chinese have toned down their public comment'' on the
border dispute, one Indian official said. ``We have seen improving
relations in the past year.''
   The late Premier Chou En-lai was the last Chinese head of
government to visit New Delhi in 1960. No Indian prime minister has
visited Beijing since the late Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954.

   Virginia Steen endured an exhausting vigil
waiting to see if her husband would be released by his Moslem
captors in Lebanon, only to hear the bittersweet news that a
colleague and fellow hostage had been freed.
   ``There's still no word yet,'' Mrs. Steen, 31, said in a
telephone interview late Monday. ``I am absolutely exhausted. I
hope most of the calls will hold off until morning.''
   Speculation built Monday that Alann Steen, one of four Beirut
University College professors abducted more than 21 months ago, was
about to be released by his captors, Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   But the organization turned over to Syrian officials
Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a visiting professor of finance and a legal
resident of the United States. Singh arrived in Damascus early
today and was scheduled to be turned over to U.S. officials.
   Singh, Steen, 49, and two other American teachers were kidnapped
Jan. 24, 1987, by gunmen posing as riot police at the campus of
Beirut University College.
   Bruce Steen, a brother, said he was encouraged by a photograph
of the four hostages released along with a statement announcing the
impending release of Singh. The photo showed Singh shaking hands
with Jesse ``Jon'' Turner, 41, while Steen and Robert Polhill, 54,
of New York City smiled as if bidding the Indian farewell.
   ``Alann looks better,'' Bruce Steen said from his home in Santa
Cruz, Calif., where he gathered with relatives. ``He's smiling and
looks like he's gained weight. He's smoking again, but who
wouldn't?''
   In April 1987, Steen's captors said he was near death and that
his health was deteriorating despite constant medication.
   Mrs. Steen spent Monday at her parents' home in Clark Lake,
about 10 miles south of Jackson in southern Michigan, fielding
reporters' questions by telephone and waiting.
   Mrs. Steen, a fine arts professor at the school who returned to
the United States after the abduction, said she and her husband, a
journalism professor, met Singh and his wife when they arrived in
Beirut in 1983.
   ``Of course, he's a dear friend and his wife is a good friend of
mine,'' she said.
   In Boise, Idaho, Estelle Ronneburg, Turner's mother, also waited
Monday for a call that never came.
   ``I'm terribly disappointed it wasn't Jon,'' Mrs. Ronneburg
said. ``But at least it's a sign they're a little more lenient than
they were.''
   Nine Americans are among 16 Westerners still missing in Lebanon.
Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Three Haitian soldiers who stormed aboard an
American Airlines jetliner bound for New York were ordered held
without bail after their arraignment before a U.S. magistrate on
air piracy charges.
   The three, who appeared before the judge Monday, plan to seek
political asylum in the United States, according to their
court-appointed lawyers.
   A complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's office accused Nicolas
Normil, 23, Jean Charleston Bienaime, 23, and Edouine Noel, 24, of
boarding the flight in Port-au-Prince on Saturday and demanding
they be taken to the United States.
   Each was carrying a loaded automatic assault rifle that they
surrendered once the plane was airborne, said the complaint. No
injuries were reported.
   Saturday's incident occurred during a period of political
turmoil in Haiti, and defense lawyers said the three fled the
country because they feared for their lives.
   The air piracy charges carry 20-year sentences.

   Police have rounded up about 150
people as they investigate bloody ethnic-related shooting sprees
that began Friday in Hyderabad and spread to Karachi, a newspaper
reported today.
   More than 215 died people died in Hyderabad and Karachi, 100
miles to the southwest, during five days of bloody clashes between
Indian immigrants called Mohajirs and Sindhi separatists seeking
independence for the southern province of Sind.
   The official Pakistan Times newspaper said foreigners were
included among those arrested. They were not identified.
   Meanwhile, the death toll in the violence continued to creep up
today as police said eight people were killed during a curfew break
the day before.
   There were no immediate reports of renewed shooting when police
allowed people out of their homes for two hours this morning.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ordered police roadblocks around
Hyderabad, where more than 160 people died and Karachi, Pakistan's
largest city, where more than 50 died.
   Ishaq Khan, after a visit Monday to both cities, said the
24-hour roadblocks were being set up to put a lid on further
violence as well as search out suspects in the recent killings.
   The army, which has been patrolling the cities in armored
personnel carriers, will back up police at the roadblocks, he said.
   The president also called for a legislative overhaul that would
lead to greater gun control, according to the official news agency,
APP.
   Both Hyderabad and Karachi, with eight million people, have been
the scene of violent ethnic clashes between Indian immigrants and
Sindhi separatists.
   The militant Sindhis are members of the Jeay Sind Movement.
   The Mohajirs, who comprise more than 40 percent of the
provincial population, have formed the Mohajir Quami Movement to
seek recognition as a fifth nationality in addition to the Sindhis,
Punjabis, Baluchis and Pathans.

   The Scandinavian Airlines System, SAS,
has concluded a cooperation deal with a major U.S. carrier, company
officials said.
   Reports here and in Cophenhagen on Monday identified the U.S.
company as the Houston-based Texas Air, which owns Eastern Airlines
and Continental Airlines.
   Details about the deal will be announced at a news conference at
New York's Plaza Hotel later today, SAS information director Knut
Lovstuhagen said, refusing to confirm the reports.
   The spokesman said only that the deal was ``extensive.'' A trade
source who declined to be identified said the agreement covers
Atlantic routes and U.S. domestic routes to which SAS has long
sought access, probably including landing rights in Miami.
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, which is 50 percent owned by the
governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, has tried to develop a
``global axis'' strategy.
   But negotiations on several other deals fell through last year,
including talks with the Belgian national carrier SABENA, with
British Caledonian and with Aerolinas Argentinas.

   Longtime rivals Bill Gunter and Rep.
Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay vied today for the Democratic nomination
to succeed Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., who is leaving the Senate
after three terms.
   Florida Republicans were picking three congressional candidates.
   The winner of the bitterly contested Democratic Senate runoff
will meet Republican Connie Mack III in the Nov. 8 general election.
   Both MacKay and Gunter men say the race is close, an assessment
reinforced by a newspaper poll last week showing MacKay with a
slight lead heading into the final week.
   But the close race was not expected to pack voting booths.
   Dot Joyce, of the Florida Division of Elections, predicted an
overall voter turnout of 25 percent.
   The election was Gunter's third try at the Senate and the second
for MacKay, who is in his third congressional term.
   Gunter, Florida's insurance commissioner since 1976,
unsuccessfully sought his party's nomination in 1974, but won the
Democratic primary and runoff in 1980 before losing to Republican
Paula Hawkins in the general election. Gunter, 54, defeated MacKay,
55, in the 1980 party battle.
   Voters also were chosing party candidates to run for a variety
of other posts, including insurance commissioner, secretary of
state, and federal and state House seats.
   L.A. ``Skip'' Bafalis and former Lee County Commissioner Porter
Goss sought the GOP nomination in the 14th Congressional District,
where Mack vacated the seat once held by Bafalis to run for the
Senate.
   The GOP runoff victor faces Democrat Jack Conway, a retiree who
was the first national president of the government watchdog group
Common Cause.
   Clifford Stearns, a hotel and restaurant operator, met Jim
Cherry, former head of the state Farmers Home Administration, in
the 6th District GOP race.
   The winner faces Democratic state legislative veteran Jon Mills
in the general election to succeed MacKay.
   In the 11th District, Republicans chose between Bill Tolley or
Rod Borum to challenge five-term incumbent Bill Nelson, who already
plans to run for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1990.

   Rescuers today picked up a
Malaysian air force pilot whose Skyhawk fighter bomber crashed into
the South China Sea.
   It was the second crash of the U.S.-built planes in less than a
week.
   All 35 remaining Skyhawks of the Royal Malaysian Air Force were
subsequently grounded for checks, the National News Agency Bernama
quoted the Deputy Defence Minister Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha as
saying.
   Since 40 Skyhawks were purchased in 1984, five have crashed. The
former U.S. Navy planes were refurbished by Grumman Corporation
before being bought by the Malaysian government.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman said the pilot was in good
condition after spending nearly 15 hours in the sea. The U.S.-made
plane crashed on Monday.
   The pilot was picked up by a Royal Malaysian Navy vessel near
the town of Miri in the state of Sarawak on Borneo Island, the
ministry said.
   The Skyhawk was the fourth to crash since March and the second
in four days. Wreckage of a plane that crashed Thursday was found
about 28 miles from the island of Labuan, 960 miles east of Kuala
Lumpur.
   The Defense Ministry will set up an independent board of inquiry
to investigate the crash.

   The White House said today that U.S. pleasure
at the release of an Indian hostage in Beirut was ``tempered by the
knowledge that nine innocent Americans are among those still held
hostage in Lebanon.''
   Mithileshwar Singh, a Beirut university professor who is a legal
resident of the United States, was turned over to the U.S.
ambassador to Syria in Damascus today after being freed in Lebanon
on Monday.
   Bob Hall, a White House press duty officer, said President
Reagan ``has been kept aware of events'' during the night.
   In a prepared statement read to reporters, Hall said, ``We are
pleased at the announcement that Mr. Singh has been freed by his
captors.
   ``We are obviously happy for him, his family and friends. Our
pleasure at his release is tempered by the knowledge that nine
innocent Americans are among those still held hostage in Lebanon,''
the statement read.
   Singh, in a brief session with reporters at the Syrian Foreign
Ministry in Damascus today, said the three American educators who
were abducted with him were the only other hostages he saw in his
captivity.
   American diplomats who took custody of Singh were hoping the
freed hostage could give them information about the nine Americans
still held in Lebanon.
   ``We are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has any
information to share with us about the welfare of the hostages who
remain,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said on
Monday.
   Nine Americans and eight other Westerners, including Terry
Waite, an emissary of the Anglican church in England, are believed
living in captivity in Lebanon.
   Sources in Syria's Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Singh was greeted at the ministry at 11 a.m. EDT by
U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerjian and Syrian Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Nasser Qaddour.
   Mrs. Oakley said Singh would be questioned in Damascus by
Djerejian and other American diplomats. They also were to determine
if he wanted to be treated at an American military hospital in
Wiesbaden, West Germany, she said.
   ``We join with Mr. Singh's relatives in rejoicing in his release
and call for the urgent, unconditional release of all hostages in
Lebanon,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   Mrs. Oakley steadfastly denied the United States had negotiated
with Iran.
   However, she said the United States tried to maintain contact in
Lebanon ``with as broad a group as possible.'' Mrs. Oakley refused
to elaborate, saying ``I am not getting into the details on all the
exact contacts.''
   Syrian forces are in effective control of areas of Lebanon, a
war-torn country in which Americans have been the target of
terrorists. Except for a few diplomats, U.S. citizens are under
strict instruction from the State Department to keep away.
   Singh was believed to have been held by the Islamic Jihad, a
pro-Iranian group. Mrs. Oakley said she could not provide any
details of his captivity, condition or circumstances of his release
until he was questioned by U.S. diplomats in Damascus.
   The U.S. official said Syria had notified the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is at the
United Nations in New York, of Singh's release.
   Singh is a 60-year-old visiting professor at Beirut University
College.
   Asked if there were indications other hostages would be
released, Mrs. Oakley said: ``No. This is all we have.''
   Singh's wife, Lalmoney, was in Beirut.
   Although he is an Indian citizen, Singh was connected to the
United States because he was a permanent resident and ``was
associated'' with the Americans who taught at the Beirut college.
   The release came after kidnappers holding Singh and three
American teachers said they would free one of their captives at the
west Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian refugees.
   The announcement that a hostage would be freed from Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine came in a 36-word handwritten
statement in Arabic delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.
   President Reagan created a stir in New York last week when he
suggested that something was in the works regarding the nine
Americans held hostage by various pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.
   He said at the time that he could not say anything further
because ``you don't talk while a no-hitter is being pitched.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later that the
president had no special information and was merely saying he
didn't want to cast bad luck on the situation.
   Neither Reagan nor Fitzwater would speculate on possible motives
behind such a hostage release.

<HEAD>House Report, Magazine Say CIA Led Domestic Propaganda Campaign
Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA organized a wide-ranging domestic
propaganda and disinformation campaign aimed at winning public
support for administration policies in Central America, The Boston
Globe reported today.
   The campaign was conceived by William Casey, the late director
of the CIA and implemented by veteran CIA propaganda specialist
Walter Raymond Jr., the Globe said, citing information gathered by
congressional investigators, the General Accounting Office and the
State Department.
   The campaign included several projects associated with Boston
University's College of Communications, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper, quoting a recent report by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said the campaign was conducted through an
intricate network of organizations, including the National Security
Council and an obscure State Department bureau called the Office of
Latin American Public Diplomacy. The apparatus also included the
participation of U.S. Army psychological operations specialists,
the Globe said.
   In a letter accompanying their report, House investigators
recommended further probes into the extent to which the CIA and
intelligence components of the Army ``conspired ... to use the
State Department as a cover for a domestic operation ... far beyond
the legal and ethical scope of their authority,'' the newspaper
said.
   According to the Globe, the NSC allegedly succeeded in placing
government-funded columns in major newspapers; arranged media
interviews with Nicaraguan Contra leaders by government surrogates
who were not identified as such; booked speaking engagements for
administration advocates; and placed large amounts of
government-sponsored material in college libraries.
   In a recent article in Foreign Policy magazine, Peter Kornbluh
and Robert Parry wrote:
   ``By running the operation out of the NSC, the (Reagan)
administration apparently sought to sidestep restrictions on the
CIA'' that prohibit the agency from influencing political
processes, public opinion or the media.
   Both Raymond and Otto Reich, who headed the State Department's
Office of Latin American Public Diplomacy, denied the existence of
a covert, CIA-inspired propaganda effort in the United States.
   Raymond, who is now deputy director of the United States
Information Agency, termed the House report and magazine article a
``conspiracy theory lacking any truth.''
   The Globe said he also denied in a telephone interview that
Casey sent him to the NSC, and that, in his special capacity as
special assistant to the president for national security, he
reported to Casey.
   ``I completely severed all ties to the agency in 1983'' after
being transferred to the NSC, Raymond said.
   Raymond said that in 1986, he, Casey and CIA counsel Peter
Dailey, discussed the establishment of an independent, private
group to advocate administration policies, but the idea was
subsequently dropped because ``there may not have been sufficient
support for administration policies.''
   Reich, who is now U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, was reached by
telephone in Caracas last Friday, the Globe said. He called the
House report and magazine article ``fantasy and libelous,'' and
said his office used Army psychological operations specialists only
to identify and collate Central American data for use in government
presentations and publications.
   However, the Globe said a number of documents cited in the House
report appear to contradict Raymond's assertions about CIA
involvement in the project.
   The Globe said GAO and State Department investigators found that
the propaganda campaign was partially financed by a number of
sole-source, noncompetitive contracts granted by the public
diplomacy office to private foundations and companies active in the
private Contra-support network. A number of those contracts
involved sums of slightly less than $10,000 to avoid the limit for
financial reporting requirements, according to the investigators.
   H. Joachim Maitre, dean of the Boston University communications
school, told the Globe that a BU-run project to provide journalism
training to Afghan resistance fighters and a documentary he
produced on the Contra rebels contras could have been part of a
covert campaign to influence media and public opinion. BU is no
longer affiliated with the project.

   Emperor Hirohito was given another blood
transfusion today to combat internal hemorrhaging but remained in
stable condition and was feeling well, an imperial spokesman said.
   The 87-year-old Hirohito, who fell ill Sept. 19 after internal
bleeding caused him to vomit blood, received a 0.4 pints of blood
this afternoon after he discharged a small amount of blood Monday
night, said Iwao Miyao, vice grand steward of the Imperial
Household Agency.
   Miyao added that the world's longest-reigning monarch remained
in serious but stable condition and managed to watch a 15-minute
daily television drama series in the afternoon.
   Crown Prince Akihito, the emperor's son, and his wife Princess
Michiko were among the many family members who visited the ailing
monarch at his bedside in his official residence, the Fukiage
Palace.
   Hirohito has been bedridden and under intensive care by palace
physicians since his internal hemorrhaging began. He is being fed
intravenously and has not been able to eat solid food except for
two small ice cubes and a few spoonfuls of porridge in recent days.
   News reports said physicians were trying to increase the flow of
intravenous nutrients, including glucose and protein, to combat
Hirohito's frailty.
   With today's transfusion, the emperor has received 10.92 pints
of blood since the onset of the crisis.
   Many reports also have said Hirohito has pancreatic cancer, but
palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied the reports.
   Nearly 4 million people have thronged to the palace from around
the country to wish the emperor a speedy recovery. Scores of
festivals, events and even state visits by foreign dignitaries have
been canceled. Cabinet ministers have also scrapped plans for
overseas trips in deference to the emperor.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said today Japan may request South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo to postpone a scheduled visit next
month, a ministry official said.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor is a symbol of the state
with little real power. His duties, which include receiving foreign
dignitaries and placing official seals on government documents,
have been taken over by the 54-year-old Akihito.

   Two powerful bombs exploded early today in
this province troubled by ethnic tensions, damaging windows and
parked cars and demolishing a railroad pylon, police said. No
injuries were reported.
   Ein Tyrol, a German-speaking extremist group seeking to reunite
the Alto Adige province with Austria, claimed responsibility in a
leaflet, officials said.
   The first bomb went off around 4:15 a.m. in front of a railroad
workers' residence in Chiusa, 18 miles from Bolzano, the provincial
capital.
   A second bomb went off an hour later about three miles away,
knocking down a pylon supporting an electrical line for the state
railroad.
   A series of bombings in recent months have plagued this
province, which was stripped from Austria at the end of World War
I. The violence stems from tensions between the 300,000 German
speakers and the 125,000 Italian speakers in the region.
   Terrorists have attacked residences of railroad workers in the
past. Most state jobs in the area are held by Italian speakers.
   The leaflet found at the site of the first blast threatened
further attacks and ``special treatment'' for ``Italian
parasites,'' police said.
   The Alto Adige is officially bilingual and legislation enacted a
few years ago gives the German speakers the upper hand in gaining
jobs and housing.
   During World War II, dictator Benito Mussolini lured workers
from all over Italy to the region north of Venice with promises of
better conditions.

   Ted Turner got some help from Scarlett O'Hara and
Rhett Butler in launching his Turner Network Television.
   Turner welcomed viewers to his new 24-hour television channel
with a brief on-camera appearance at 8 p.m. Monday.
   Next came a rendition of the national anthem _ the same film
clip used to launch Turner's Cable News Network in June 1980 _
followed by ``Gone With The Wind,'' the classic film starring
Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler.
   The MGM movie is the cornerstone of Turner's collection of
movies, which will be used for much of the programming on TNT.
   Muppet creator Jim Henson's popular ``Fraggle Rock'' show moves
from Home Box Office to TNT today. ``The Muppet Show,'' with Miss
Piggy and Kermit the Frog, was scheduled for this afternoon.
   Turner has said TNT will feature a hybrid of cable and network
programming, and initially will make liberal use of cartoons in the
daytime and movies at night.
   Turner, who also owns Cable News Network, CNN Headline News and
WTBS SuperStation, has scheduled made-for-TNT movies starring
Martin Sheen and son Emilio Estevez, Farrah Fawcett, Charlton
Heston and Faye Dunaway.

<TEXT>
   Police today ordered the
seizure of video cassette recordings of the anti-apartheid film
``Cry Freedom,'' which was banned from cinemas two months ago.
   Police said local distributors had inquired about selling the
video cassettes and that illegal or ``pirate'' copies of the film
already were being circulated in South Africa.
   ``Cry Freedom'' tells the story of black South African activist
Steve Biko, who died while in police detention in 1977, and Donald
Woods, a white newspaper editor who befriended Biko.
   Government censors approved the film and it began showing in
South Africa on July 29. However, police seized the film several
hours later saying it contributed to the country's ``revolutionary
climate.''
   ```Cry Freedom' is interspersed with propagandistic
misrepresentations, while at the same time it contains a number of
themes that relate to the revolutionary onslaught against South
Africa,'' police said today in a statement.
   ``The television recording of `Cry Freedom' endangers the safety
of the public, the maintenance of public order and will delay the
termination of the (28-month-old) state of emergency,'' the
statement added.

   A Palestinian accused of collaborating with the
Israeli authorities shot and seriously wounded another Arab today
in the occupied West Bank, Arab hospital officials and witnesses
said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed at an election rally in the
West Bank to expand Jewish settlements throughout the occupied
territories, an Israeli newspaper reported.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, about 3,000 students returned to their
fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms after a four-month closure aimed
at preventing anti-Israeli activism in the schools.
   Officials at Nablus' Rafidiyah Hospital said Mufeed Nueirat, 26,
was shot twice in the face and shoulder by another Arab acused of
cooperating with Israel.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Palestinian witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the shooting in the West Bank village of Maythaloon, about 55 miles
north of Jerusalem, was apparently the result of a feud between the
two Arabs.
   The witnesses said Nueirat was shot with an Israeli-made Uzi
submachine gun. Palestinians who cooperate with Israel are assigned
such weapons for self defense.
   In leaflets circulated last month, uprising leaders ordered
Palestinians to attack and kill all suspected collaborators. Seven
Arabs accused of cooperating with Israel have been killed since the
uprising began on Dec. 8.
   Since Dec. 8, at least 280 Palestinians and six Israelis have
been killed.
   Mithkal Natour, director of Jerusalem's Arab education board,
said the opening of schools followed last week's successful return
to classes of students in the first through fourth grades. ``There
have been no problems and we expect no violence,'' Natour said.
   Secondary schools in Jerusalem as well as more than 800 schools
and universities attended by about 300,000 students in the West
Bank remain closed as part of an army effort to prevent violence.
   In the Gaza Strip, elementary schools are open but all 27 high
schools have been closed.
   Palestinians protested the extended closures throughout the
occupied lands Monday. The Arab schools were to have remained open
throughout summer to make up for lost school time, but were closed
by Israeli authorities in June.
   The Jerusalem Post reported today that at an election rally in
the Jewish settlement of Ariel, Shamir vowed his Likud Party would
increase Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
   Only six Jewish settlements have been built since the formation
in 1984 of the coalition government of Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' left-of-center Labor Party.
   According to Housing Ministry figures, the 131 existing
settlements have been expanded since 1984 at a rate of 1,500
housing units a year.
   About 65,000 Israelis live in the occupied territories along
with 1.5 million Palestinians. Israel captured the West Bank from
Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt during the 1967 Middle East
war.
   On Monday, Israeli troops shot and wounded 22 Palestinians in a
sweep of more than a dozen West Bank villages, according to Arab
hospital officials.
   The army confirmed that 11 Palestinians were wounded in violence
Monday, and troops imposed or extended curfews on eight refugee
camps and areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, confining more
than 150,000 Palestinians to their homes.

   Union officials at a chemical plant are
objecting to a new policy requiring workers who wear respirators to
shave their beards.
   ``I think it's terrible,'' said Robert Ellis, Teamsters Local 64
steward at the American Hoechst Celanese Corp. chemical plant, who
said the policy intruded into workers' personal lives.
   Three employees with beards were suspended since the policy went
into effect Saturday, but were reinstated Monday after agreeing to
shave, said David Velmosky, the company's manager of human
resources. More than 90 percent of those with beards have shaved
them off, Velmosky said, although he wasn't sure how many people
that was.
   The policy is based on a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration standard, plant officials said.
   ``If you have a beard, it's going to be very difficult if not
impossible to get a good seal,'' said Fred Joseph, OSHA industrial
hygiene supervisor.
   American Hoechst Celanese employs 756 people in Coventry, 400 of
them union members.

   Two men and a woman stormed a government

and injuring three other people, police said.
   The assailants took the policeman's gun as he stood guard
outside the ground-floor office, then used it to shoot the officer
twice in the head, Spanish National Radio reported. The shooting
took place at 9:40 a.m. on the busy street of Santa Engracia,
police said.
   One of the attackers fired at a second policeman, grazing him in
the leg, and at a man and a woman, who also were brushed by the
bullets but were not seriously injured, police said.
   The two men were accompanied by a woman, police said. The three
fled on foot after grabbing several blank personal identification
cards, police said.
   The police officer, Bernardino Ortega Ramsad, 47, was dead on
arrival at Red Cross Hospital, the hospital reported.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

<HEAD>IRS Subpoenas Bank Records In Money-Laundering Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has subpoenaed
documents on electronic transfers to California banks as part of a
nationwide crackdown on money laundering by drug dealers and tax
evaders, it was reported today.
   The IRS and the Department of Justice hope to penetrate the
multibillion-dollar money-laundering operations of drug kingpins
and uncover the methods used by tax evaders to conceal
transactions, according to documents obtained by the Los Angeles
Times.
   Records from banks including Bank of America were subpoenaed as
part of the effort to trace funds transferred between U.S. banks
and Hong Kong, Panama, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and the
Netherlands Antilles _ five known tax havens where laws protect
against disclosure bank account information.
   The banks are not targets of the investigation, but the subpoena
noted that Bank of America paid a $4.75 million fine in 1986 for
failing to report 17,000 cash deposits and non-electronic transfers
in excess of $10,000 as required by law. There is no law covering
wire transfers.
   IRS officials with the San Francisco district office, which is
conducting the California portion of the investigation, said
numerous criminal and civil investigations are under way as a
result of the records obtained from the banks over the past several
months.
   They refused to identify the targets of the investigations or
name other banks involved in the subpoenas. Other IRS offices are
conducting similar inquiries, they said, but declined to name them.
   The wire-transfer records enable the IRS to construct a pattern
of transactions by those seeking to get around the U.S. law that
requires banks to notify the government of transactions of $10,000
or more in cash, said Alexander D. Seddio, IRS criminal
investigations agent.
   To evade the law, they make a series of smaller deposits,
consolidate the money in one account and wire it to an off-shore
bank, Seddio explained. Any amount of cash can be deposited in an
offshore bank and wired to a U.S. bank, evading the $10,000 U.S.
reporting requirement and making the money appear to be legitimate.
   Bank of America officials declined to comment on the subpoena or
the volume of records requested, as did Wells Fargo, which recently
acquired Barclays of California bank, another reported target of
the subpoenas.
   ``Bank of America is considered particularly vulnerable to money
laundering because the large number of its branches offers
anonymity to launderers,'' said the subpoena issued this summer by
the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.
   The subpoena obtained by the Times requested copies of all wire
transfers to and from the five offshore locations for 1986 and 1987.

   Diplomats and Red Cross officials
reunited a 2{-year-old Romanian boy with his pregnant mother, who
had fled the Soviet bloc to seek political asylum in Austria.
   The toddler, separated from his mother for the past four weeks,
was picked up in Budapest, Hungary, by a car of the Austrian Red
Cross and taken to Styria province Monday, where his mother is
staying at a boarding house, the Austria Press Agency reported.
   No names or details of the Romanian woman's escape were
disclosed by authorities. They also would not say how the woman and
her son were separated.
   The woman, who is in her seventh month of pregnancy, was
completely surprised by the arrival of her son, because she had not
been told by officials of the project in order avoid emotional
strain. The boy had been in a Budapest child care center.
   The Austrian Interior Ministry quickly granted an entry visa for
the Romanian boy, although his mother's request for asylum has not
yet been acted upon, the news agency said.
   The action was possible with the cooperation of the Austrian
Embassy in Budapest and the Hungarian mission in Vienna as well as
the two countries' Red Cross societies.

   Helicopters had to be used to rescue
loggers threatened by a forest fire burning in the hills of
west-central Oregon, a spokesman for the state Department of
Forestry said.
   Elsewhere, fires that have charred about 1.6 million acres in
and around Yellowstone National Park still are not fully contained
by fire lines. But a 12,000-acre arson fire that destroyed one
house in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles has been
contained, fire officials said.
   Oregon forestry spokesman Doug Decker said he was unsure how
many loggers were rescued from the Marten Ridge Fire, which had
burned 120 acres east of Springfield by late Monday. There were no
injuries but a new log loading machine was destroyed, he said.
   He said helicopters would resume dropping water and retardant
today.
   The fire started Monday on an active logging operation on
Weyerhauser Co. land about 28 miles east of Springfield, Decker
said. The cause was under investigation.
   No changes have been reported in days on the fires in
Yellowstone, but fire managers do not want to predict when they
might be able to call the blazes completely contained, much less
controlled.
   Crews continue to be released from the fire lines, said park
spokeswoman Sandi Robinson. She had no figures on how many
firefighters remain in the park.
   Park officials are growing concerned about the spread of a
noxious weed made possible by the flames that have opened up dense
forest, said Jim Sweaney, western district resource management
coordinator in the park. The plant, spotted knapweed, can choke out
other plants.
   ``There are a lot of areas where sunlight is hitting the ground
for the first time in 100 years,'' he said.
   Near Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., a 12,000-acre fire in the San
Bernardino Mountains that has cost nearly $2 million to fight has
been contained, but fire officials said they don't expect to
extinguish it until Thursday.
   ``It's really important we get all of the hot spots because the
wind could pick up a spark,'' U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Lindsay Maierhofer said.
   The fire, set by an arsonist Wednesday, was fanned last week by
gusty Santa Ana wind blowing at up to 60 mph. The fire closed
nearby Interstate 15 for a time and forced hundreds of people to
evacuate homes.
   One ranch home was destroyed. Property losses totaled about
$250,000, officials said.

   Indian professor Mithileshwar Singh said
today he felt wonderful after his release from 20 months of
captivity in Lebanon, but sorry that three American colleagues
abducted with him were still hostages.
   ``Thank God I am free,'' the 60-year-old Singh, a resident alien
of the United States, told reporters at the Foreign Ministry. ``But
I am very sorry that my colleagues and friends are still in
captivity. I hope they'll be freed soon.''
   Singh, clean-shaven and dressed in a gray suit, spoke to
reporters shortly after being turned over to U.S. Ambassador Edward
Djerejian by Syria's minister of state for foreign affairs, Nasser
Qaddour. The Indian charge d'affaires, B. Balarishnan, also was
present.
   Asked about his captivity, he said: ``The treatment was better
than I had expected. But there's no substitute for freedom in this
world.'' He said the kidnappers gave him insulin for his diabetes.
   Singh said the three American educators who were kidnapped with
him Jan. 24, 1987 from Beirut University College were the only
foreign hostages he saw in captivity. Singh was a visiting
professor of finance at the college.
   Today, Singh tried to deflect questions, saying he was tired.
But he later said he felt ``wonderful.''
   The former hostage later was driven to Djerejian's residence,
where he was reunited with his wife, Lamlani, who came to Damascus
from Beirut.
   U.S. officials said Singh planned to go to a U.S. base at
Wiesbaden, West Germany. A base spokesman, Air Force Lt. Col Pat
Maloney, said a C-141 transport plane left today for Damascus to
pick up Singh.
   Singh was freed in Beirut late Monday. Syrian intelligence
officers drove him to Damascus early today.
   His release came five minutes after a deadline set by his
captors, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, for the
release of a hostage. The three Americans who were abducted with
Singh remain in captivity.
   The captors had said they would release a hostage as a goodwill
gesture to encourage U.S. support for the Palestinians protesting
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   U.S. State Department officials said they want to talk to Singh
about the other hostages. In television interviews today, L. Paul
Bremer, U.S. ambassador on counterterrorism, reiterated Reagan
administration statements that ``we've not made any deals and we're
not going to make any deals'' to gain the hostages' freedom.
   In Washington today, Bob Hall, White House press duty officer,
said the Reagan administration's ``pleasure at (Singh's) release is
tempered by the knowledge that nine innocent Americans are among
those stil held hostage in Lebanon.''
   In an interview published today in The New York Times, the
spiritual leader of a group believed to be an umbrella for captors
of foreign hostages was quoted as saying it was ``not yet the right
time for the American hostages to be freed.''
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also was quoted as
saying the fate of the hostages ``would have to wait for the
outcome of the American presidential election.'' He said Iran
preferred to deal with the Republicans.
   The nine Americans are among the 16 foreigners missing in
Lebanon. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The three Americans held with Singh were Jesse Turner, 41, a
native of Boise, Idaho; Alann Steen, 49, of Boston; and Robert
Polhill, 54, of New York City.
   A U.S. official said Singh, who carries a U.S. green card, has
applied for U.S. citizenship. Explaining why he was turned over to
the Americans, the official who requested anonymity said: ``He has
put himself under our protection and we will take him in charge.''
   Singh was born in Varanasi, India, Dec. 13, 1927 and has spent
most of his life in the United States. After teaching at the
University of Wisconsin-Platteville; Milton College, Wis., and
Western Colorado, he joined the Beirut University College faculty
in 1983.

   Three men and a woman have been charged in
the 1983 killing of New York theatrical producer Roy Radin, who
authorities said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the
movie ``The Cotton Club.''
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn said the murder was a
contract killing and that movie producer Robert Evans, whose
credits include ``Chinatown'' and ``The Marathon Man,'' was a key
figure in the film's financial negotiations.
   The prosecutor said Evans' testimony ``is going to become
important at some point'' and his participation in the deal remains
under investigation. However, Sheriff's Homicide Capt. Robert Grimm
stressed that Evans is not a suspect in Radin's death.
   Charged with Radin's May 13, 1983, murder were Karen De Layne
Greenberger, described by one sheriff's spokesman as a former
cocaine dealer, and William Molony Mentzer. Also charged were Alex
Lamota Marti and Robert Ulmer Lowe. The complaint alleged they
killed Radin ``for financial gain.''
   The complaint alleged special aggravating circumstances, which
could result in the death penalty if the defendants are convicted.
   At the time of Radin's death, there were rumors the slaying was
linked to cocaine, but Conn said Monday, ``That will not be the
subject of our prosecution.''
   Conn alleged the Radin slaying resulted from a dispute between
Radin and Ms. Greenberger about a plan to raise $35 million from
investors in the Puerto Rican government for production of the
``The Cotton Club.''
   The 1984 film about a Harlem speakeasy, starring Richard Gere,
reportedly cost $47 million to produce, and was met with generally
lukewarm reviews.
   The prosecutor said Radin was introduced to Evans by Ms.
Greenberger, and Radin became a middleman in the Puerto Rican
negotiations. But a dispute developed between Radin and the woman
over a finder's fee she demanded, Conn said.
   On May 13, 1983, he said Radin stepped into a limousine rented
by Ms. Greenberger ``with the intention of going to a restaurant
and discussing the business arrangement further. He never arrived
at the restaurant.''
   On June 10, a forest ranger discovered Radin's body in a stream
bed at the end of a road in a rural part of Los Angeles County,
about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had been shot in the back
of the head.
   The complaint, based on new evidence, was issued Sept. 22 but
was sealed for fear of the safety of an informant who has since
been relocated, Conn said.

   The victim was not immediately identified, but police said he
was a prison officer in his mid-40s.
   Police said children from a nearby elementary school were
walking home for lunch when the bomb exploded nearby, but escaped
injury.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
Prison officers are among the targets of the Irish Republican Army
in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and unite
it with the Irish Republic.
   It was the 81st killing in the province this year, and brought
the official death toll since Northern Ireland's present strife
erupted in 1969 to 2,699.

<HEAD>Pentagon Will Keep Stealth a Secret _ For Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

   The Pentagon has rejected, for now, a plan to
provide the American people with details of the super-secret
Stealth jet fighter, defense officials said today.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the idea of
acknowledging the airplane's existence for the first time was
debated at the highest levels of the Defense Department and on
Capitol Hill before being rejected ``for the time being.''
   ``It's not going to happen right now,'' said one of the sources.
``There were concerns at the top of the military heirarchy. And
there was a bipartisan view that this was not the most auspicious
time for this. Maybe later.''
   Asked if the reference to bipartisanship meant the plane might
be unveiled after the presidential election, the source replied,
``Possibly.''
   According to military and industry sources, the United States
secretly began building Stealth _ or radar-evading _ jet fighters
in the mid-1970s and now maintains more than 50 of the single-seat
planes at a tightly guarded facility in Nevada.
   The plane has been dubbed the F-19 by various industry officials
but reportedly also carries the military designation of F-117A.
   The Pentagon and Air Force have never acknowledged the
airplane's existence, even when pressed about mysterious crashes
over the years.
   According to the sources, the planes are flown only at night and
are kept at a high state of readiness for use as ``aerial shock
troops,'' capable of slipping behind enemy lines without being
detected and creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs.
   The defense officials said today the proposal to finally unveil
the plane to the public was considered for a number of reasons.
   First, explained one official, was an issue of logic. The Air
Force already has announced it will unveil its new Stealth bomber
next month, and that plane is based on more recent technological
developments than the Stealth fighter.
   ``It's general knowledge that the technology of the fighter is
older than the bomber, and we're about to let everybody see the
bomber,'' the official said.
   Secondly, Pentagon officials have concluded that even if they
wanted to keep the program secret, upcoming court fights are likely
to shatter security. Production line workers at a Lockheed Corp.
plant in Burbank, Calif., where the Stealth fighters are thought to
be made, have gone to court with charges they are being sickened by
exposure to dangerous chemicals.

   Police stood guard outside an elementary
school today as a manhunt was pressed for a camouflaged sniper who
seriously wounded a 9-year-old on the playground.
   Absenteeism was high as local police and sheriff's deputies
checked vehicles and school buses and guarded entrances at Mascotte
Elementary School in the wake of Monday's shooting.
   The gunman rose up from behind some bushes around 11 a.m. Monday
and fired three shots at a gym class on the school's playground
before fleeing, Sheriff's Department spokesman Randy Swails said.
Police have said they know of a suspect but gave few details.
   Leah Wilbanks, a third-grader from Mascotte, was the only one of
about 25 students who was wounded in the unprovoked attack, Swails
said. She was listed in stable condition early today at Orlando
Regional Medical Center.
   Worried parents kept more than 150 children home, said Sherry
Crawford, front office secretary. Normally, only 15 to 20 children
are absent from the 417-member student body.
   ``Quite a few parents walked their children in,'' she added.
``We're trying to carry on as normal.'' Doors at the school were
kept locked, except for the front door.
   Earlier, Mascotte Principal Carmen Arnold said counselors would
be on hand today to help the children deal with their fear.
   The five-officer police station two blocks from the school was
empty as local police teamed with deputies to search for the
suspect.
   ``They haven't caught anybody yet,'' said June Bloodsworth, who
was answering the police phone at City Hall this morning.
   Police appealed for calm and patience, warning residents of this
rural central Florida town not to take the law into their own
hands. Some enraged townspeople carrying baseball bats had joined
in the manhunt Monday.
   ``They should watch their kids ... and leave it to us,'' said
Lake County Sheriff Noel E. Griffin Jr., who described the gunman
as ``a nut'' with an unknown motive.
   ``We have a good suspect,'' Griffin said. ``They might get the
wrong man.''
   The wounded girl's parents, paramedic Alan Wilbanks and
ambulance dispatcher Mary Wilbanks, arrived at the school minutes
after the shooting and treated Leah on the way to the hospital,
said emergency medical technician Dennis Beaudin.
   The youngster suffered two gunshot wounds to the arm and chest,
said Jean Lowe of the medical center.
   In a search hampered by heavy rain, a helicopter, an airplane,
dog teams and up to 50 officers combed a four-square-mile area of
woods, lakes and orange groves around the one-story white brick
school of 417 students.
   Many residents joined the manhunt.
   ``We been after him ever since it happened,'' said Jim Bryant,
25, whose son was at the school. ``We don't need people like that
running around the community.''
   ``We want to contain him,'' said Larry Johnson, 28, swinging a
baseball bat.
   The shots that hit the child were apparently the only ones fired
by the camouflage-clad man, who witnesses said had a full beard and
a punk haircut, Swails said.
   The man, who was believed to be carrying a .22-caliber rifle,
said nothing during the incident, the spokesman said.
   On Sept. 26, a gunman at an elementary school in Greenwood,
S.C., wounded nine pupils, two fatally, and two teachers. James
William Wilson, 19, is charged with murder and is undergoing
psychiatric tests.
   Four days earlier, a man described by friends and relatives as
emotionally disturbed since serving in Vietnam stalked around a
Chicago school killing four people and injuring two before a
wounded policeman gunned him down.
   Mascotte is a rural community about 30 miles west of Orlando,
with weathered houses and mobile homes. A sign at the entrance to
town welcomes travelers to ``the friendly city.''
   ``Mascotte is notorious for taking care of its own,'' said
Leah's grandfather, Tom Chapman. ``I guarantee I would kill him if
I could.''

   Fresh threats of a possible price war among OPEC
nations have pushed oil futures lower in a test of price levels not
seen in more than two years.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, skidded 31 cents to settle at $13.06 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday. The move follows a 55-cent
plunge in the previous session.
   Crude prices, which had not closed that low since August 1986,
over the past five weeks have slumped by about $2 a barrel.
   Experts say consumers probably will not benefit significantly
unless crude holds at those depressed levels for an extended period.
   On the exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline prices fell 0.25
cent to settle at 41.98 cents a gallon. Heating oil fell 0.95 cent
to end the day at 37.78 cents a gallon.
   Prices moved slightly higher in early trading today, but Richard
Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said the
advance was due to technical factors and that market ``fundamentals
are bearish.''
   November West Texas Intermediate picked up 18 cents a barrel,
rising to $13.24, while gasoline rose 0.42 cent to 42.40 cents a
gallon and heating oil was up 0.47 cent to 38.25 cents a gallon.
   Monday's slide in crude intensified after Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
largest producer and the world's biggest exporter, issued a sharply
worded statement that analysts said was intended to pressure other
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
curb their output levels or face continued, sharp declines in
prices.
   Saudi Arabia said it believes returning to prescribed production
levels is the best way for restoring full stability to turbulent
oil markets, but it will not freeze its own production while others
continue to violate their ceilings.
   Analysts said the Saudis are intent on boosting their output to
drive prices lower and make other oil producers suffer narrowing
profit margins.
   OPEC nations are pumping an estimated 3 million barrels a day
beyond their 17.5-million-barrel daily quota.
   ``There's a certain strategy within the Saudi camp that they
will demonstrate that you can't win by overproducing,'' said Bob
Baker, senio energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Indeed, the Saudis threatened that other OPEC members ``will now
feel the harm of deterioration'' that overproduction has on the
market.
   The statement said certain unidentified OPEC members had
``perhaps forgotten the benefits of when they abided by (the
cartel's) December 1986 (pricing and production) agreement, which
helped send oil prices at least briefly to levels around $20 a
barrel.''
   The Saudis claim to have lost as much as $1.9 billion over the
years from repeatedly lowering their own output to bolster OPEC.
With substantial resources, the Saudis can tolerate lower oil
prices more easily than other nations.
   With a series of OPEC committee meetings scheduled to begin
later this month, analysts caution that oil prices could rebound if
there is any hint that members of the 13-nation cartel might reach
a new accord to rein in production.
   Crude prices ``would have to be depressed for quite some time
before it works through to gas at the pumps and to heating oil,''
said James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc.
   ``Gasoline stocks are low _ almost 10 million barrels behind
last year's level _ and demand is picking up slightly,'' said
Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst at E.D.& F. Man International Inc.
That may help to keep gas prices at current levels in the face of
falling crude prices.
   But experts say price stability alone is beneficial. ``Because
consumers' incomes are rising, stable prices can mean a cheaper
product in real terms,'' Steel said.

Examination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson will
undergo another psychiatric examination following a weekend rampage
that left glass strewn around his New Jersey mansion, according to
a report published today.
   ``Mike is back on track,'' manager Bill Cayton said in an
interview published in New York Newsday.
   Cayton said Tyson, 22, would visit ``a world-renowned
psychiatrist'' today to get a second opinion on a diagnosis the
boxer is manic-depressive.
   He said Tyson did not mention Sunday's incident, in which the
boxer reportedly hurled a sugar bowl, an andiron, and chairs
through windows of his Bernardsville, N.J., mansion.
   Cayton, who has had a rocky relationship with Tyson since the
champion's marriage to actress Robin Givens eight months ago, said
Tyson came to his office around Monday along with welterweight Mark
Breland before heading to Breland's Long Island training camp.
   ``When he got here, he came bounding up the stairs and gave me a
really big hug,'' Cayton said. ``He was very warm. Very friendly.
... It was like old times. Mike is going to be OK,'' Cayton said.
   Tyson's fit of anger was sparked by interviews given to Barbara
Walters by his wife and her mother, Ruth Roper, that were broadcast
Friday on ABC's ``20-20,'' according to the Daily News and New York
Post.
   Givens, with Tyson seated next to her, had told Walters she was
``very, very much afraid'' of the boxer because of his ``extremely
volatile temper.''
   Tyson was also angry that Givens was going to California to
begin filming her TV series, ``Head of the Class,'' the News today
quoted an unidentified friend as saying.
   Givens was in California Monday with her mother. Givens is
expected to spend five days a week on the set until April,
according to Warner Bros.
   Tyson refused to say what triggered his tirade, but told the
News, ``I'm going through a difficult time right now. It doesn't
look good. ... I'm hurt because I'm in love. I'm still in love.''
   Police said that they handled Sunday's incident like any other
such case and that, as far as they were concerned, the matter was
closed.
   ``This is a domestic violence incident not unlike many others,
except for the fact that it involves a public figure,''
Bernardsville police Chief Thomas J. Sciaretta told a news
conference Monday.
   Sciaretta, revealing few details, said no one was injured or
arrested and that Givens did not want to sign a domestic violence
complaint.
   The chief said Tyson ``has done nothing wrong. It's his home.
He's entitled to do anything he pleases provided no one is
injured.''
   ``I took it (an andiron) from the fireplace and threw it through
the window,'' Tyson told the News in an interview from Breland's
gym in Queens. ``So what? I paid for it. It's my house.''
   Cayton said Tyson wants to go ahead with his twice-postponed
title defense against Frank Bruno of Britain, which is scheduled
for December.
   Last month, Tyson crashed his car and was knocked unconscious,
forcing the postponement of a boxing match and sparking news
reports that the boxer threatened to kill himself prior to the
accident. In August, Tyson broke a bone in his hand during a street
fight with boxer Mitch Green.
   After the car accident, Tyson was evaluated by a psychiatrist at
the urging of Givens and Roper. He was diagnosed as a
manic-depressive and lithium carbonate was prescribed.

<HEAD>Prison Inmate on Furlough Accused of Attacking Former Girlfriend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state prison inmate accused of
attacking his former girlfriend while on furlough from a halfway
house was ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail after pleading
innocent to assault charges.
   ``We have some serious problems with the prison furlough
program,'' Hampden County District Attorney Matthew J. Ryan Jr.
said Monday after the arraignment. ``The police are even more upset
than we are and the victims can't understand what is going on.''
   It was the third time within a year, he said, that a prisoner
from Hampden County has been arrested while on a furlough or on an
early release program.
   A furlough program for first-degree murder convicts in
Massachusetts was canceled earlier this year following the
kidnapping and assault of a Maryland couple by an inmate who was on
furlough. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has come under fire from his GOP
presidential rival, George Bush, because of the furloughs of
murderers.
   In the recent case, Isaac Aycox, 37, pleaded innocent to charges
of assault and battery, armed breaking and entering, malicious
damage and threatening to murder his former girlfriend. He also
pleaded innocent to charges of assault and battery on a police
officer and trying to steal a police car while at police
headquarters, authorities said.
   Aycox had been serving concurrent 8-to-20-year terms for armed
robbery and assault. He would have been eligible for parole within
weeks and was to have completed his prison sentence in March,
according to Kathy Ayers, a spokeswoman for the state prison system.
   ``This was his first furlough,'' she said. ``He was working
during the week and checking in at night.''
   Early Sunday, Aycox allegedly appeared at the former
girlfriend's home. When she refused to see him, he smashed the
windows of her car with a chunk of concrete, police said. Then he
broke down the door of her apartment, struck her and threatened to
kill her, McGovern said.

   President Reagan ruled out again today
negotiations with the captors of nine American hostages and said
liberating them from their Lebanese captors remains a ``great
problem'' despite the release of an Indian prisoner.
   The White House, meanwhile, tempered expressions of pleasure at
the release of the Indian in Beirut with ``the knowledge that nine
innocent Americans are among those still held hostage in Lebanon.''
   Mithileshwar Singh, a Beirut University professor who is a legal
resident of the United States, was turned over to the U.S.
ambassador to Syria in Damascus today after being freed in Lebanon
on Monday.
   Singh, who is a diabetic, will fly to a U.S. military hospital
in Wiesbaden, West Germany, for medical treatment in the next few
days, L. Paul Bremer, U.S. ambassador for counter-terrorism, said
today.
   Reagan, in an exchange with reporters, did not explain how
Singh's freedom was obtained. But he again ruled out any U.S. deals
with the captors, believed to be an pro-Iranian Islamic group.
   He said trying to secure the release of the nine Americans held
in Lebanon ``has been a great problem for us and it's very much on
our minds.''
   Reagan declined to speculate on what move the United States
might make to win the release of the nine American hostages.
   ``We've done no negotiating on that at all,'' he said, ``and I'm
not going to hazard a guess as to why they turned him loose _ not
as long as we've still got hostages there,'' he said while posing
for pictures with Republican congressional leaders in the Cabinet
Room.
   Asked if he thought Iran was attempting to manipulate the
outcome of the U.S. presidential election, Reagan smiled and said,
``Well, if they are, I hope they're on the right side.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, asked about the political
implications of the situation, said, ``I just hope for the sake of
the hostages they are released today, without any reference to the
election. Every day they stay there is another day of hell. And I
assume that we are not concerned about the outcome of the election,
but with the hostages.''
   In an interview published today in The New York Times, the
spiritual leader of a group believed to be an umbrella for captors
of foreign hostages was quoted as saying it was ``not yet the right
time for the American hostages to be freed.''
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also was quoted as
saying the fate of the hostages ``would have to wait for the
outcome of the American presidential election.'' He said Iran
preferred to deal with the Republicans.
   Pressed to discuss what options are available for U.S. officials
attempting to get the hostages released, Reagan said, ``I can just
tell you that this has been a big problem for us. It's something
very much in our minds. ... I just can't talk any further about
it.''
   In 1985, the president secretly approved U.S. weapons sales to
Iran in an arrangement that was supposed to encourage moderation in
Tehran and free captive Americans.
   When the plot surfaced in 1986 it produced the greatest uproar
in Reagan's eight-year presidency.
   In a prepared statement read earlier in the day to reporters,
White House spokesman Bob Hall said, ``We are pleased at the
announcement that Mr. Singh has been freed by his captors.
   ``We are obviously happy for him, his family and friends. Our
pleasure at his release is tempered by the knowledge that nine
innocent Americans are among those still held hostage in Lebanon,''
the statement read.
   In television interviews today, Bremer reiterated Reagan
administration statements that ``we've not made any deals and we're
not going to make any deals'' to gain the hostages' freedom.
   Bremer said on the ``CBS This Morning'' that American officials
have spoken to Singh only briefly and have no indication that he
was carrying any messages from his captors.
   Singh, in a brief session with reporters at the Syrian Foreign
Ministry in Damascus today, said the three American educators who
were abducted with him were the only other hostages he saw in his
captivity.
   American diplomats who took custody of Singh were hoping the
freed hostage could give them information about the nine Americans
still held in Lebanon.
   ``We are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has any
information to share with us about the welfare of the hostages who
remain,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said on
Monday.
   Nine Americans and eight other Westerners, including Terry
Waite, an emissary of the Anglican church in England, are believed
living in captvity in Lebanon.
   Sources in Syria's Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Singh was greeted at the ministry late this morning
by U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian and Syrian Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Nasser Qaddour.
   Syrian forces are in effective control of areas of Lebanon, a
war-torn country in which Americans have been the target of
terrorists. Except for a few diplomats, U.S. citizens are under
strict instruction from the State Department to keep away.
   Singh was believed to have been held by the Islamic Jihad, a
pro-Iranian group.
   Singh is a 60-year-old visiting professor at Beirut University
College.
   Asked if there were indications other hostages would be
released, Mrs. Oakley said: ``No. This is all we have.''
   Although he is an Indian citizen, Singh was connected to the
United States because he was a permanent resident and ``was
associated'' with the Americans who taught at the Beirut college.
   The release came after kidnappers holding Singh and three
American teachers said they would free one of their captives at the
west Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian refugees.
   The announcement that a hostage would be freed from Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine came in a 36-word handwritten
statement in Arabic delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.

   A U.S. Navy diver testified today
he feared confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi was about to shoot
him before a flight attendent intervened.
   ``He (Hamadi) had a chrome-plated automatic pistol in his hand.
He pointed it directly in my face and pulled back the hammer,''
Tony Daniel Watson told Hamadi's air piracy and murder trial.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused in the June 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which Navy diver Robert Stethem was
killed and 39 Americans were held captive for 17 days.
   Watson, 30, told the court that Hamadi took him to the front on
the plane after it was hijacked and threatened him with a pistol.
   ``I was very afraid I would be shot, but Uli Derickson pleaded
with him in German,'' Watson said.
   Mrs. Derickson, the chief flight attendant, has been credited
with negotiating with Hamadi in German in attempts to prevent
mistreatment of the passengers.
   Watson also told the court that he recognized the picture of a
man now jailed in France as one of the men who came aboard the
plane during a Beirut stop and held him hostage.
   Watson was shown the picture of a man identified in court
records as Fuad Ali Salah.
   ``I saw him twice while we were being held captive in Beirut,''
Watson said.
   Salah was arrested March 27, 1987 in France on suspicion of
taking part in bombings in Paris, according to evidence introduced
in court.
   Watson, dressed in a gray suit, said he was still in the Navy,
but did not give his rank or residence, in keeping with court
guidelines intended to protect witnesses.
   Hamadi listened intently to the testimony with one arm propped
on the desk in front of him, his chin resting in his left hand.
   Earlier today, American physician Michael Clark told the court
that he performed a second autopsy on Stethem at the request of the
FBI in 1986.
   Clark said he was asked to perform the autopsy to find out
whether other injuries to the 23-year-old sailor had been
overlooked during a preliminary autopsy done after his death in
June 1985.
   He said his 1986 autopsy did not find injuries that had been
overlooked, but confirmed previous testimony that Stethem had lived
between three and 10 minutes after he had been shot in the head.
   Other witnesses have testified that Stethem, of Waldorf, Md.,
was thrown onto the runway immediately after being shot.
   Flight 847's pilot, John Testrake, told the court several weeks
ago that he believed Hamadi was the gunman.
   Other witnesses have said they believed the other hijacker,
identified by a U.S. indictment as Hassan Ezzeddine, was the killer.
   Hamadi, who has admitted being one of the hijackers, has denied
killing Stethem.
   Hamadi was arrested at the Frankfurt airport in January 1987
after customs officials found explosives in his luggage.
   In the week that followed his arrest two West German businessmen
were kidnapped in Beirut. Both have since been released.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Hamadi, is imprisoned in West
Germany. He was convicted earlier this year by a Duesseldorf court
of conspiracy in the abduction of the two West Germans in an effort
to pressure the West German government to release his brother.
   West Germany denied a U.S. request for the extradition of
Mohammed Hamadi, saying he would be tried on the same charges here.

   President Reagan today exhorted the Senate to
approve House-passed anti-drug legislation, saying he'll consider
the business of Congress finished for the year once that has been
accomplished.
   Meeting with Republican congressional leaders in the Cabinet
Room of the White House, Reagan complained that the House-passed
drug bill has been ``sitting on the Senate calendar for days.''
   He said that since Congress has enacted the 13 appropriations
bills necessary for continuing government operations into the
fiscal year which began last Saturday, the anti-drug legislation is
the lone major business that has been left unfinished.
   ``I think it's time for Congress to go home,'' the president
said. ``I want to urge the Senate to pass a responsible drug bill
... so that it can be quickly conferenced and enacted and then I'll
wish the 100th Congress a hearty adieu.''
   Reagan's statements came as senators were negotiating privately
on crucial time-limiting agreements that could enable Congress to
pass the anti-drug bill before adjournment.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the bill was
being held up by ``Democrats playing games with parental leave and
child care and minimum wage; if they'd stop playing games and be
realistic, we could do a drug bill this week, but we can't carry on
this charade on the Senate floor. We could be here another two or
three weeks.''
   A bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the drug measure
Monday. But they agreed the Senate will run out of time if long
debates ensue over controversial issues such as user penalties and
admission of illegally seized evidence.
   Even if the Senate overcame its own time obstacles, it still
would need to agree to a compromise with the House _ which approved
its own drug measure this month, 375-30.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said no senator wants to be held
responsible for preventing the drug bill from coming to a vote.
Sponsors said they were working on arrangements to limit amendments
to about a half-dozen from each party.
   Even if a drug bill is enacted this year, it would face serious
financing problems.
   The Senate bill is a two-year package that would authorize about
$2 billionin new spending, but only $450 million may be available
immediately, according to 14 sponsors who discussed the bill at a
news conference.
   About $250 million of that figure would come from expected
revenue increases from tougher Internal Revenue Service tax
enforcement.
   Rudman said he would propose an amendment to a technical tax
bill that would increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco products to
pay for the drug bill. Other lawmakers said the proposal would
fail, and suggested taking the money from existing programs.
   In a strategic decision that might prevent some delaying
tactics, sponsors decided to include a death penalty provision as
part of the original legislation. This could prevent a long debate
by capital punishment supporters to win inclusion of the provision.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he will offer amendments for
strict user penalties such as denial of federal benefits for anyone
convicted of drug sales or use.
   Other senators are expected to offer an amendment to allow
admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in
``good faith.''
   Key provisions in the Senate bill would:
   _Make substance abuse treatment on request an explicit goal, and
finance increased treatment capacity.
   _Authorize money for state and local law enforcement grants.
   _Permit the death penalty for drug kingpins who intentionally
order a killing; for hired killers who commit murder as part of a
continuing drug enterprise; and for anyone who kills a law
enforcement officer in a drug-related crime.
   _Create a Cabinet-level ``drug czar'' to coordinate federal
anti-drug efforts.
   _Authorize money for new prison construction, and more public
defenders, drug enforcement agents, FBI agents, prosecutors,
marshals, Coast Guard personnel, immigration officers, and alcohol,
tobacco and firearms agents.
   _Strengthen penalties for drug offenses committed within 1,000
feet of a school, purchasing drugs from children, distributing
drugs to children, or employing youngsters to sell drugs.

   Thirty-five graduates of a police academy
that is under investigation for an epidemic of illness among cadets
gathered today to defend their instructors and institution.
   ``This is where you separate the men from the boys and the women
from the girls,'' said Michael Gonnello, of the West Springfield
police force. Gonnello was among alumni who met at the academy to
show their support.
   He and others criticized the state for removing the two state
police instructors accused of overworking cadets and discouraging
them from drinking water after 16 cadets required medical attention
last month for dehydration and related problems. The two
instructors were running their first course, although they had
assisted in others.
   ``These troopers know their job,'' said Jerry Millar of the
Amherst police force. ``The only problem we had was that they
didn't have time to teach us. The last few weeks they had to cram
in a lot.''
   One of the rally organizers, Colleen Griswold, said earlier that
women trainees who accused instructors of calling them ``pregnant
sows,'' couldn't possibly be telling the truth.
   ``I'll eat my combat boots if one of the females can come to me
and say that is true,'' said Griswold, an Amherst police officer
and a 1988 graduate of the academy in this city just south of
Springfield.
   The school was closed for a time after the cadets fell ill. The
most seriously ill, Timothy Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield, required a
liver transplant after collapsing on his first day Sept. 19 and
remained in critical condition today. The others suffered
dehyrdration and kidney failure, doctors said.
   Shepard's sister-in-law said this morning that there were signs
he was coming out of a coma. She said he started to turn his head
Monday and appeared to recognize his mother and his pregnant wife.
``We've seen some good signs ...,'' she said. ``We're praying and
hoping.''
   Some cadets said they went through 10{ hours of exercise with
relatively little water. Their police chiefs have said water was
available, but the cadets may have hesitated to break ranks to ask
for it.
   On Monday, the state Department of Public Safety ordered its
police academies to stop using pushups and other exercise as
punishment in training cadets.
   John Barrett III, mayor of the small western Massachusetts town
of North Adams and chief critic of the training program, has said
an investigation indicated that instructors had taunted women
cadets by calling them ``pregnant sows'' and ``baby makers,''
singled out two male trainees as ``class idiots'' and meted out
excessive punishment, forcing cadets to walk like ducks and lie
like cockroaches with their arms and legs in the air for long
periods.
   Academy officials have said that training was meant to be
stressful, but not abusive, to prepare recruits for the insults and
other stresses that go along with police work.
   Griswold defended her instructors, including John Richardson.
   ``I find it very hard, if not impossible, to believe he
(Richardson) would ever have said something like that,'' said
Griswold, whose class at the academy ran from October 1987 to
January 1988.
   She denied there had been any abuse of cadets.
   ``All I know is what happened to me,'' Griswold said. ``I never
missed a day and I was never sick.''
   As the only woman in her class, she said, ``I never felt
discriminated against for a second.''
   Richardson and another instructor, trooper Charles Gilmore, bade
farewell to their class Monday as they prepared to turn the cadets
over to another pair of state troopers.
   The two men asked to be reassigned Friday because of the
attention the academy has received since members of their class
began collapsing two weeks ago.

   A train carrying explosives collided with a coal
train in the Russian Republic, setting off an explosion and fire
that killed four people and injured 280, Soviet media said.
   Twelve dwellings were destroyed, and hundreds of people were
left homeless after Monday's blast, the government newspaper
Izvestia said.
   Izvestia said the explosion in a switching yard near the Ural
Mountain city of Sverdlovsk sent a column of black smoke and red
flames into the sky and created a crater 180 feet wide and 30 feet
deep.
   It did not identify the explosives contained in two cars of the
freight train, but said they were for use in the domestic economy.
   Izvestia said two workers died at the scene and two other people
died later at a hospital. It reported 87 people were hospitalized.
The official Soviet news agency Tass said 280 people sought medical
help.
   The collision in Sverdlovsk, an industrial city about 850 miles
east of Moscow, wasthe third major rail accident in the Soviet
Union within six months. On Aug. 17, a passenger train crashed on
its way from Leningrad to Moscow, killing 24 people and injuring
more than 100. In June, three cars loaded with explosives blew up
in the city of Arzamas, about 240 miles east of Moscow. Eighty
people died and 229 were injured.
   Monday's explosion caused tanks of oil and gas to catch fire,
Izvestia said. ``Dark smoke covered the entire city,'' it said.
   The newspaper said 12 dwellings were destroyed and 14 buildings
were damaged. It did not say how big the dwellings were, but it was
likely they were apartment buildings.
   The Soviet media said a dispatcher ordered the train carrying
explosives to halt at the wrong location on Track 3 leading into
the railyard, and that the cars became disconnected from the
locomotive and started rolling away.
   Engineer V. Pimenov managed to reconnect the locomotive, but
could not stop the train before it slammed into the coal train on
Track 6, where the two tracks connected.
   Izvestia quoted V. Matskevich, Sverdlovsk's chief railroad
engineer, as saying the dispatcher's orders to the freight train
were a gross violation of rules.
   Media reports said a commission was formed to investigate the
accident.

   Demonstrators chanting ``Housing Now'' briefly
interrupted Senate proceedings today before being carried out of
the chamber by doorkeepers and police detectives.
   ``We need to stop business as usual,'' an unidentified woman
shouted from the visitors gallery overlooking the Senate floor,
where Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., had just finished speaking. She
began shouting ``Housing Now'' and was joined by several other
women, who were quickly grabbed and carried out of the chamber.
   The Senate had just begun a quorum call and only a few senators
were on the floor at the time. The demonstration was over in about
a minute.
   Protesters, who maintain Congress should make more money
available for housing for the homeless and the poor, have staged
demonstrations around Capitol Hill offices over the past week. Last
week, several were arrested for refusing to leave the office of
Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass. Others were arrested when they
walked into the office of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and began
removing furniture, saying they wanted Helms to know what it was
like to be evicted.
   Capitol police were still investigating today's incident and
names of those removed from the Senate chamber were not immediately
available.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reverses Eating Club Ruling, Sends Back For New
Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court today reversed a state
order that Princeton University's two remaining all-male eating
clubs admit women, ruling a procedural error several years ago
denied the clubs a fair hearing.
   A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court
ruled the clubs were entitled to a hearing before an administrative
law judge in 1985 prior to a determination of whether they fell
under New Jersey anti-discrimination laws.
   ``In the circumstances of this case ... the clubs have not been
afforded due process,'' the court said. ``This is a hotly contested
case. Despite the fact that the parties have stipulated 230 facts,
many material factual disputes remain.''
   Much of the social life at Princeton University revolves around
13 clubs where most juniors and seniors eat. The clubs are in
privately owned houses near the campus. Since Princeton began
admitting women in 1969, all clubs except the Ivy Club and the
Tiger Inn have changed their rules to admit women. The ruling comes
nearly a decade after Princeton graduate Sally Frank began fighting
to gain admission to the clubs when she was a junior at the Ivy
League school.
   ``Of course I'm disappointed that the court decided to reverse
on a technicality and that as a result, the clubs will be able to
continue discriminating for several years,'' said Ms. Frank, now an
associate clinical professor at New York Law School. ``But I remain
as committed as ever to eliminating the clubs' policies barring
women.''
   Lawyers for the clubs hailed the ruling.
   ``The court has ordered what we have sought for quite a while _
due process,'' said Barbara Strapp Nelson, a lawyer for the Ivy
Club. ``Now, Ivy will finally receive the fair hearing it is
entitled to as to whether it is a private or public accommodation.''
   The ruling reverses a 1987 order by state civil rights officials
that the two clubs must admit women.
   Pamela Poff, director of the state Division of Civil Rights, had
rejected an earlier ruling by an administrative law judge who said
the clubs did not have to admit women as long as they severed their
ties to the university.
   Ms. Poff said the clubs were public accommodations subject to
anti-discrimination laws, and could be required to admit women.
   A month after Ms. Poff's ruling, the Tiger Inn's Board of
Governors voted to cut any ties to the school rather than be forced
to admit women.
   Officials said they eliminated official ties with the school's
intramural sports program, pulled out of the Intraclub Council, and
even went so far as to ask that college-owned sidewalk snowplows
lift their blades as they pass the club's building.

   Residents voted today in a wet-dry
referendum they said has special significance because of a fatal
church bus crash last spring.
   Police say the driver of a pickup truck involved in the crash
was drunk when the accident occurred, killing 27 people _ 24 of
them children.
   Voter turnout ``will probably be bigger for this than it will be
for the presidential election,'' said Debbie Roeder, a member of a
pro-dry group.
   When she arrived at the polls at 7:30 a.m., she said, about five
people were waiting in line to vote.
   ``I was number 57, I believe, and that was an hour and a half
after it opened,'' she said, adding that friends and relatives told
her their polling places had been busy, too.
   Both the wet and dry forces said a high voter turnout would help
their cause; both sides offered rides to the polls.
   Chuck Webster, a leader of the ``wets,'' said interest is high
because Carrollton has been in the news since the May 14 bus-pickup
truck crash on Interstate 71.
   The Carroll County clerk's office said it has registered 520 new
voters. A total of 6,039 were eligible to vote, the highest number
in a decade.
   The dry forces estimated that they spent less than $1,000 on
newspaper advertising. The wet forces have spent about $6,000 on
advertising in newspaper and radio.

   A 9-year-old boy killed by a pipe bomb
explosion had tried to set fire to the device as many as six times
before it blew up, says one of the five children injured in the
blast.
   Authorites were still searching for clues to the origin of the
bomb and how the children obtained it.
   Max Herrera and two other boys rolled paper around the bomb
Sunday and used matches to set fire to the paper, said Jael Zamora,
11.
   ``At first, just smoke and a little flames came up,'' she said.
``But they kept doing it.''
   When they ran out of matches, Max sent his 4-year-old sister,
Irena, who also was injured, to their house to get a lighter, Jael
said.
   After giving up on the paper and stepped on it to put out the
flames, the boys shook the bomb to get powder out of it, she said.
   ``The last time he lit it, they poured black powder on the
flames and it exploded,'' Jael said. ``When my parents heard the
explosion, they ran out of the house.''
   Lou Iliano, agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said some of those involved in the explosion cannot
remember where the bomb came from.
   Three children remained hospitalized today, two in good
condition and one in serious condition.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today that
Republican rival George Bush had failed every assignment as vice
president and that American business has suffered as a result.
   ``We cannot build a strong and vibrant economic future for
America on a mountain of debt, and the American business community
knows that,'' Dukakis said in a speech at Northwestern University.
   The Democratic nominee also said he supports ``reasonable
limits'' to curtail what he called a ``merger and acquisition binge
that continues to sweep the country.''
   The Massachusetts governor voiced confidence that he is
``beginning to turn this race around'' after trailing Bush in most
national polls, but said the contest was ``tough and competitive.''
   He compared the upcoming election with the outcome of the 1960
race in which John F. Kennedy won a narrow victory over Republican
Richard Nixon.
   Suggesting that history might repeat itself, Dukakis reminded
his audience that Illinois had gone for Kennedy by a mere 8,800
votes _ or about one vote per precinct _ in a state of 10 million.
   The Democratic candidate, highlighting trade issues, accused
Bush of embracing an economic policy of drift which permitted large
U.S. trade deficits to accumulate unchecked.
   ``George Bush thinks we need a president who blames American
workers and corporations for the trade deficit,'' Dukakis told a
receptive audience of about 1,000 students and business leaders.
   If elected, he said, he and running mate Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
would work with labor and management to ease the trade deficit and
make ``the label `Made in America' a symbol of quality and value
and durability all over the world.''
   Dukakis said the country is losing business and trade markets to
foreign competitors at a record rate. ``Cite these facts, and
George Bush will say you're downgrading America,'' he said. ``My
friends, if we disregard these facts, we endanger America.''
   Dukakis said the vice president had failed his assignments on
promoting U.S. sales in Japan, regulatory reform, drug
interdiction, international terrorism and banking reforms.
   ``Mr. Bush was given five important missions by this
administration and he failed every one. And that was before they
asked him to pick a running mate in this election,'' Dukakis said,
referring to GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle.
   In Chicago on Monday, Dukakis promised to enforce civil rights
laws, provide same-day voter registration and work for statehood
foer the District of Columbia.
   Speaking to a mostly black audience at the Regal Theater on
Chicago's South Side, the Democratic nominee accused the Reagan
administration of turning back the clock on civil rights.
   ``We're going to aim high and enforce the civil rights laws of
this country, not veto them; we're going to have a Justice
Department that will inspire us, not embarrass us; and we're going
to have an attorney general who understands what the word justice
means,'' Dukakis said.
   A Democratic administration, according to Dukakis, would
``support the affirmative action programs that (Republican vice
presidential candidate) Dan Quayle voted against.''
   In his speech, Dukakis paid tribute to the late Mayor Harold
Washington and praised former rival Jesse Jackson as a ``great son
of Chicago'' whose ``sun still shines brightly over all of
America.''
   Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said Jackson, who was
campaigning for the Democratic ticket on the East Coast, was unable
to join Dukakis. However, the aide said a Dukakis-Jackson joint
appearance was planned for later this month.
   From here, Dukakis headed for a tour of a Jeep plant in Toledo,
Ohio, and was attending a private fund-raising dinner in
Washington, D.C., tonight. He was returning to Boston, where he
will spend all day Wednesday.

   A wealthy financier and his
companion, a daughter of the late actor John Wayne, were tied up
and beaten in a daytime attack by two men who slashed the man's
Achilles' tendons.
   ``This attack was meant as a warning or message, and exactly
what that message is we don't know yet,'' said police Detective
Sgt. Mike Jackson. ``We've got a million angles to explore on this
case.''
   Roger Luby, 52, and Aissa Wayne, 32, were attacked Monday
morning by two men who followed them inside the electric gates at
the mortgage financier's multimillion-dollar home, said Jackson.
   The attackers tied up Luby and Ms. Wayne, the eldest daughter of
Pilar and John Wayne, Jackson said. Then they beat both and slashed
the Achilles tendons behind each of Luby's feet.
   However, they were released after being treated at Hoag Memorial
Hospital Presbyterian, family members said.
   Nothing was stolen, Jackson said.
   Both victims are going through divorces. Ms. Wayne is embroiled
in a custody battle over her 1-year-old daughter.
   Luby also is involved in real estate litigation and bankruptcy
proceedings involving his purchase of the Broadway Department Store
in Los Angeles, the Orange County Register reported, citing court
records, friends and business associates.
   Ms. Wayne was in seclusion with relatives after the attack.
   ``She's home with us,'' said her brother Ethan. ``She's going to
be fine. But she's very scared about all this.''
   Her estranged husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, an orthopedic
surgeon, said he was dismayed by the attack.
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said. ``We still communicate a lot
even though we're not together. Who would do such a thing and why?''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today he was gaining ground on
George Bush whom he called a failure as vice president. Republican
Bush proposed a $100 million umbrella organization to encourage
volunteerism, saying, ``I want our affluent to help our poor.''
   While the two White House contenders campaigned in critical
states _ Dukakis in Illinois and Bush in California _ the vice
presidential candidates devoted their time to preparing for
Wednesday night's debate.
   Republican Dan Quayle, who has studied at an undisclosed
location in Washington, D.C., was leaving today for Omaha, Neb.,
for the debate, as was Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, who did his final
preparations in Austin, Texas.
   Dukakis, at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said Bush
had failed in five missions: as part of an administration effort to
increase U.S. sales in Japan, as head of task forces on regulatory
reform, drug interdiction and international terrorism, and in an
effort to recommend banking reforms.
   ``Mr. Bush was given five important missions by this
administration and he failed every one. And that was before they
asked him to pick a running mate in this election,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor, slightly behind Bush in recent
polls, said he was ``beginning to turn this race around.'' He said
the final weeks would be ``tough and competitive.''
   Bush, in Sacramento, Calif., proposed creation of ``Youth
Engaged in Service to America,'' an organization chaired by the
president that ``will work with existing youth programs and will
put an emphasis on programs that are started in our schools.''
   The organization might develop some new volunteer programs but
mostly would work in partnership with programs already under way,
such as Peace Corps, the California Conservation Corps and others,
said Bush campaign adviser Loret Ruppe, director of the Peace Corps.
   Bush said, ``I want our affluent to help our poor. I want our
young to help our elderly. ... I want the young men and women of
our tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or the subway, or the
metro, and go into the cities where the want is.''
   On Monday, Dukakis promised a presidency that would enforce
civil rights laws while Bush pledged support for development of a
space station in his administration.
   With the election five weeks away, the Democratic presidential
nominee told black supporters on Chicago's South Side Monday night
that the nation will be deciding between ``two different futures,
two different roads to travel.''
   And the choice of the GOP nominee will lead to an ``America of
privilege _ an America where the very rich get even richer and the
rest of us just get by. This is George Bush's America,'' Dukakis
said.
   The vice president, who earlier Monday welcomed the return of
the space shuttle Discovery and its five-man crew, told a rally in
Redding, Calif., that he is committed to the creation of an
operational space station by 1996.
   ``This goal is achievable, sensible ... and we will meet that
goal,'' Bush said.
   The two candidates vowed to hold their second presidential
debate either Oct. 13 or 14, despite the League of Women Voters'
withdrawal of its sponsorship. The date will be determined by the
length of the American League baseball playoffs.
   In announcing the decision, League President Nancy M. Neuman
cited the campaigns' control of debate format and other details
that would squelch any spontaneity.
   ``We have no intention of becoming an accessory to the
hoodwinking of the American public,'' she said.
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, sponsors of
the first presidential debate and the vice presidential encounter,
quickly stepped in and agreed to take over sponsorship.
   Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said the
group hopes to keep the debate in Los Angeles and was seeking help
from local groups to finance preparations, which the League had
estimated at $500,000.
   Dukakis, in a rare appearance in the predominantly black Chicago
neighborhood, paid tribute to late Mayor Harold Washington and the
Democrat nominee's former rival for the nomination, Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson is a ``great son of Chicago'' whose ``sun still shines
brightly over all of America,'' Dukakis told the audience.
   The candidate pledged that his administration would enforce
civil rights laws, provide same-day voter registration and select
judges committed to equality.
   ``We're going to aim high and enforce the civil rights laws of
this country, not veto them; we're going to have a Justice
Department that will inspire us, not embarrass us; and we're going
to have an attorney general who understands what the word justice
means,'' Dukakis said.
   Earlier in the day, the Massachusetts governor stopped in
Dearborn Heights, Mich., where he spoke to students about drug use
and helped destroy about $100,000 worth of marijuana, cocaine and
heroin by throwing it into a county incinerator.
   At a rally in Hartford, Conn., Dukakis responded to Bush's
charge that the Democratic nominee is a big-spending liberal.
   ``The solutions we're proposing are not big-money solutions or
big-government solutions,'' Dukakis said. ``And unlike Mr. Bush's
tired old ideas, they won't leave America running in place. They'll
make America the most powerful and productive country on earth.''
   Meanwhile, the Democrat's campaign introduced two new ads
following the recent theme of ``The Packaging of George Bush.'' The
ads, which show campaign advisers sitting around a table, deal with
the Reagan administration's environmental record and Bush's
dealings with Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.

   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock, facing
left-wing accusations that he is betraying socialism, insisted
today that his Labor Party must adopt new economic policies if it
is to win power.
   He said the party must be ``serious about nuclear disarmament''
but made no flat promises to scrap British atomic weapons
unilaterally.
   To critics who criticize a party policy review designed to move
the party closer to the center, Kinnock said, ``There is no
concession to Thatcherism as great as letting it win again.''
   Most delegates applauded. But groups of leftists, who say he is
seeking to win votes with a watered-down version of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's conservative program, sat silently.
   Kinnock ordered the party policy review after Labor's third
successive election defeat in 1987.
   On the issue of unilateral nuclear disarmament, Kinnock said
today:
   ``When we conclude our review next year and resolve upon our
policy for fighting the next general election, that policy must be
serious about nuclear disarmament, serious about defense.''
   He avoided using the word ``unilateral,'' but said that unless
Labor won power, the Conservatives plan to deploy the new
generation of Trident sea-launched missiles ``will be completed and
deployed and, in addition, other systems will be multiplied under
the guise of modernization.''
   The 46-year-old Welshman was addressing more than 1,000
delegates in this north England resort on the third day of the
weeklong convention, which began with his crushing victory for the
party leadership over left-winger Tony Benn.
   On Monday, the conference endorsed the first stage of a policy
review which emphasizes emphasizes the role of capitalism while
promising greater state control of the economy.
   The review, the first stage of a two-year process, includes
dropping a commitment to renationalize all state-owned industries
sold by Mrs. Thatcher and also accepts some of her drastic curbs on
the powers of labor unions.
   Ron Todd, leader of the transport workers' union, the biggest in
the country and whose support was crucial to Kinnock, warned Monday
night that the Labor Party leader had not been given ``a blank
check.''
   The new proposals released last spring also stipulate tax rate
ceilings of 50 to 60 percent, compared with 86 percent under the
last Labor administration which lost power to Mrs. Thatcher in 1979.
   Mrs. Thatcher cut the top rate of income tax soon after winning
power and this year, in a second major reduction, slashed the top
rate from 60 to 40 percent.
   The rest of the policy review is due to be published next
spring. Final decisions on the whole package will be made at
Labor's 1989 convention.

   Police arrested almost 200 anti-abortion
activists at two Atlanta clinics today as the opening round of what
protest organizers say will be a four-day ``Siege of Atlanta'' got
under way.
   ``They're blocking the street, they're failing to disperse, so
we're locking them up,'' said Police Capt. W.W. Holley.
   More than 100 demonstrators arrived at one midtown abortion
facility about 10:40 a.m., many of them crawling up the street
toward the small brick building. When some tried to go beyond a
temporary fence installed outside the clinic, police began dragging
the protesters away toward waiting buses and vans. About 75 were
arrested.
   A mile away, another protest began at another clinic. There were
two groups demonstrating _ one which made attempts to get inside
the building, and another which sat on the ground singing hymns.
   As police dragged demonstrators toward buses and vans, many
protesters let their bodies go limp. Police pleaded with the
protesters to get up, so they would not have to drag them away.
   In all, more than 100 people were arrested at the second site.
   Earlier, city officials had braced for the expected
demonstrations by arresting the protest leader, and filing suit
against others, claiming they were engaged in a criminal conspiracy.
   About 800 demonstrators, some of whom attended a pre-dawn Mass,
assembled this morning at a motel on the edge of town. Protest
leaders distributed plastic bags to collect the identification of
those who planned to be arrested, so that authorities could not
determine their names.
   That approach was used during a series of anti-abortion
demonstrations in Atlanta this summer. Then, hundreds were arrested
over several weeks and many refused to give their names to
authorities, in solidarity, they said, with anonymous victims of
abortion.
   Operation Rescue, a New York-based anti-abortion group, has
vowed to send hundreds of demonstrators to blockade the city's
seven clinics that perform abortions this week.
   Abortion rights groups have trained about 300 volunteers to
escort women through the demonstrators. The volunteers plan to use
black umbrellas, emblazoned with ``choice'' in large blue letters,
to shield the faces of women seeking to enter targeted clinics.
   The pro-choice groups held their own church rally Monday night
but have said they won't stage counterdemonstrations because that
would make things more difficult for patients.
   Before this mornings protests began, police were already
watching the clinics and metal barricades were up around at least
one clinic that was a frequent target of demonstrators this summer.
   Randall Terry, Operation Rescue's leader, was arrested Monday,
charged with conspiracy to commit a crime and jailed, said police
Sgt. Dorothy Smith. Terry was on the scene as the demonstrators
gathered this morning, after an unidentified person posted his
$75,000 bond.
   ``This is clearly preventive detention,'' Terry said earlier in
a statement. ``They want to stop us from attempting to save the
lives of endangered babies in Atlanta.''
   The city on Friday filed a lawsuit asking a Fulton County
Superior Court judge to declare Operation Rescue leaders and others
a public nuisance and issue a permanent injunction against the
demonstration. A hearing on the lawsuit was set for this afternoon.
   Terry, McMonagle and five other Operation Rescue leaders were
named as defendants, as well as ``Baby Jane Doe'' and ``Baby John
Doe,'' the names used by dozens of demonstraters arrested this
summer.
   The lawsuit seeks a $500-a-person fine for each violation of the
injunction. It claims that Operation Rescue and its members
constitute a continuing criminal enterprise, violating the state's
Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Speakers at Monday night's Operation Rescue rally at suburban
St. Jude the Apostle Roman Catholic Church said the protests were
dictated by their Christian beliefs.
   A smaller but equally enthusiastic crowd of about 200 abortion
rights advocates gathered at downtown Central Presbyterian Church
heard the anti-abortionists labeled as immoral and un-American.
   More than 700 people were arrested in demonstrations that began
during the Democratic Convention in July. Many remained in jail for
as long as 68 days, giving their names only as Baby Jane Doe or
Baby John Doe, as the city refused to release them unless they gave
their real names.

   Republican George Bush today proposed
a volunteer program to spur young people into community and social
services such as helping the needy and drug abusers.
   Youth Engaged in Service to America, with a $100 million federal
pricetag and chaired by the president, ``will work with existing
youth programs, and will put an emphasis on programs that are
started in our schools,'' Bush said in a morning speech to the
business-oriented Comstock Club.
   Bush has tried to portray himself as a caring presidential
candidate who wants to help the unfortunate, while the Democrats
have depicted him as a wealthy man out of touch with the country.
   Bush acknowledged that some children are ``living lives of utter
desolation ... and we have yet to find a way to help them.''
   The federal funds would be set up as a matching program to
generate the same amount in provate donations.
   ``The best of the existing volunteer programs will be expanded
and new programs will be developed. The end result I hope is that
citizen service will become a real and living part of every young
American's life,'' Bush said.
   He suggested awarding high school or college credit for youth
volunteerism under the program.
   As examples, he said young people could help poor children,
women with abusive husbands, or immigrants who don't speak English.
   ``I want our affluent to help our poor,'' he said. ``I want our
young to help our elderly ... I want the young men and women of our
tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or the subway, or the metro,
and go into the cities where the want is.''
   The YES to America program mostly would work in partnership with
community efforts and programs already in place, such as Peace
Corps, the California Conservation Corps and other community-based
volunteer programs, according to Bush campaign adviser Loret Ruppe,
director of the Peace Corps.
   Bush pledged Monday to commit the nation to development of a
manned space station by 1996, telling an outdoor rally in
picturesque northern California the space program ``brings us
together.''
   The speech in Redding, deep in timber country, followed a
high-visibility trip to the California desert Monday that let the
vice president share the spotlight with the returning Discovery
space shuttle and five astronauts.
   The journey from Washington to California to welcome the
Discovery back from its four-day voyage was officially billed as a
vice presidential trip. But Bush's campaign paid for the travel to
vote-rich California, a crucial battleground in the November
election.
   Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 that he would ``commit this
nation to the development of an operational space station by the
year 1996.''
   ``This goal is achievable, sensible ... and we will meet that
goal,'' Bush said.
   Though taking a few customary swipes at his Democratic opponent
Michael Dukakis, Bush said he mostly wanted to talk about space. He
said he is ``fully and utterly committed to the U.S. space program,
and utterly committed to the peaceful exploration of near and far
space.''
   Bush noted President Reagan had said that space is a place
``where mankind may be liberated from hunger and want and
oppression.''
   ``But I would add that it has long seemed to me that while the
higher purpose of our space program is science and progress, there
is another purpose,'' he said. ``The U.S. space program gives us a
lift. It brings us together.''
   He also reiterated his proposals for a National Space Council,
to be chaired by the vice president, that would make
recommendations on the future of space exploration.
   He said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should
be looking toward Mars. ``The way I see the logical order is this:
first the shuttle then the space station,'' he said. ``First the
moon, then perhaps Mars.''
   The made-for-TV scene at Redding was the kind his campaign
stages with near perfection.
   When singer Lee Greenwood closed the rally by singing ``I'm
Proud to Be an American,'' cheering people waved American flags as
the sun sank in the background. Bush, a wide smile across his face
as he sang along with the refrain, ``God Bless the USA,'' standing
with a little girl in a Brownie outfit and in front of high school
cheerleaders clad in white and purple.
   But one large banner raised briefly at the back of the crowd
testified to a cash crop that has brought considerable wealth in
surrounding California areas. ``Legalize Marijuana,'' it said.
   Bush's welcoming handshake to the shuttle crew as they stepped
off Discovery gave the vice president a chance to share in the
positive publicity generated by the first shuttle mission since the
deadly Challenger explosion close to three years ago.
   He watched the landing from a high wooden platform constructed
on the dry lake bed where the shuttle touches down.
   ``Because of you our space program is back in the game,'' Bush
told the returning astronauts at Edwards Air Force Base.
   Bush said the seven members of the Challenger shuttle crew were
``cheering from above'' at the successful mission.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's alma mater, Moscow State
University, awarded honorary doctorates Tuesday to American
economist John Kenneth Galbraith and British writer Graham Greene.
   Galbraith, a professor at Harvard University, was honored for
``his services in the development of sciences and the humanities,''
the official Tass news agency said.
   Greene's doctorate is a sign of ``his outstanding services in
the field of literature and in the strengthening of friendly
contacts with the Soviet Union,'' Tass said.
   It said the certificates were presented to Galbraith and Greene
by Anatoly Logunov, rector of Moscow State University and a member
of the Academy of Sciences.
   Gorbachev, a native of the southern Russian region of Stavropol,
studied law at Moscow State University and met his wife Raisa
there. Both graduated in 1954.

   Workers scrambled Tuesday to erase the last
vestiges of a professional wrestling match to set the scene for
Wednesday night's high-stakes grapple between vice presidential
candidates Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle.
   ``We do this every day of the year,'' said Terry Forsberg,
manager of the Omaha Civic Auditorium. ``It's not even as massive
as some of the concerts we do. We're used to it.''
   ``How big a job is it?'' asked Phil Schaefer of the Freeman
Decorating Co. ``So big it can't be done.''
   But that didn't deter workers who hurried to remove the
wrestling ring left over from Saturday night's match and replace it
with platforms for television cameras and anchor booths for the
nationally broadcast, 90-minute campaign debate starting at 8:30
p.m. EDT Wednesday.
   Work orders strewn about the auditorium's lower level called for
``400 feet of blue carpet'' and ``100 feet of red and white rope''
to turn the building into a patriotic showcase. Places were
designated for potted plants in ``living green.''
   The stage for the Quayle-Bentsen confrontation will be familiar
to millions of TV viewers. It will be the same stage used for the
Sept. 25 debate between Republican nominee George Bush and his
Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis at Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The hall ordinarily seats more than 10,000 people, but space was
being trimmed to create, in effect, a gigantic TV studio.
   ``We're turning an arena into a hall,'' Forsberg said.
   Although the bulk of the transformation was completed Tuesday,
workers were ready to perform some fine-tuning after Bentsen and
Quayle visit the hall Wednesday and negotiate changes with the
non-partisan commission that is sponsoring the debate.
   ``They've told us to be ready for last-minute changes,'' said
work foreman Stan Benis.
   Details such as the height of the lecterns being used by the
candidates awaited their personal inspection. ``The lectern height
can be adjusted,'' said Stan Mitchell, a technical adviser to the
commission.
   Schaefer said 20 employees of his decorating company, which also
helped prepare the Republican convention hall in New Orleans in
August, were busy laying carpet, hanging the bunting and setting up
tables for an expected 1,500 reporters.
   Extra workers were flown in from Denver as reinforcements,
partly to help with debate-related events elsewhere in Omaha.
   Forsberg said the biggest hassle was not getting the hall ready
but making arrangements for TV debate coverage.
   ``This is routine,'' he said, pointing to workers hanging
spotlights and stringing wires. ``Then you go outside and
downstairs and it's no longer routine.''
   Officials have installed about 500 telephone lines and made
arrangements for additional electrical power to accommodate the TV
satellite trucks lining the streets outside the auditorium.
   ``When you add the television city outside, we had to bring in
extra power,'' Forsberg said.
   The challenge was doubled for the debate commission, which took
on sponsorship of the second Bush-Dukakis debate in Los Angeles in
mid-October when the League of Women Voters withdrew as sponsors on
Monday.
   ``I'm thrilled with the way things are shaping up,'' said Janet
Brown, executive director of the commission. ``I didn't really
realize when I got on a plane this morning that we'd be working on
two of them right now instead of one.''
   Omaha city officials cleared parking spaces around the
auditorium for reporters and debate organizers, and set up shuttle
buses between the Omaha airport and downtown. The city denied
charges that the homeless were being driven away from downtown
streets to avoid embarrassing out-of-town visitors.

   A tanker truck carrying hazardous chemicals
overturned and caught fire early today on Interstate 10 near here,
spewing toxic fumes and forcing an evacuation and the closure of
the highway, police said.
   Five people were injured in the collision, includeing four who
were admitted to a hospital, said Trooper Paul Wood. None of the
people was identified.
   Authorities said they had no idea how long the evacuees would be
out of their homes. State police spokesman Ronnie Jones said they
numbered more than 500.
   ``From our point, the situation is under control. It's a just a
matter of letting the fire burn out,'' he said.
   State Police Lt. Herman Rogers said the 6:20 a.m. accident
involved two trucks, one of which was carrying 4,600 gallons of
toluene, a flammable liquid that gives off toxic fumes when
burning. Toluene is used in the manufacture of TNT and other
compounds. It is also called methyl benzene.
   In two other compartments, the truck was carrying petroleum
naptha and naptha distillate, both also toxic and flammable.
   The other truck was carrying pipe. All five of those injured
were in one or other of the two trucks, Wood said.
   ``We have a toxic cloud heading towards Jennings. Interstate 10
is closed down. We are trying to advise listeners ... do not go
towards the Jennings area,'' state trooper Darrell Fontenot told
KTQQ radio in nearby Sulphur, La.
   Parish Sheriff's spokesman Al Hebert said all schools in the
southwestern Louisiana city of about 12,000 people were closed
because of the accident.
   Rogers said I-10 was closed to traffic in both directions near
the Acadia-Jefferson Davis parish line, and vehicles were being
diverted to other highways. Jones said he expected the freeway to
be closed all day.
   Officer Calvin White said air space was restricted up to 600
feet above and three miles around the fire site.

   President Roh Tae-woo on Tuesday
renewed his proposal for talks with his North Korean counterpart,
Kim Il Sung, and said he was ready to cooperate to end the
confrontation on the divided Korean Peninsula.
   ``I make it clear that I am willing to visit (the North Korean
capital of) Pyongyang to meet with (Kim Il Sung), if the North is
agreeable,'' Roh said in the nationally televised speech to the
National Assembly.
   Roh also announced an annual budget of $27 billion, up 10.9
percent.
   Roh's speech drew cool response from the main opposition group,
Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy, which accused the
government of continuing to hold political prisoners.
   About a dozen opposition members boycotted Roh's speech. Others
remained seated and refused to clap their hands when the president
walked into the hall.
   Opposition leaders criticized the government for releasing what
they said was just one-tenth of political prisoners under a special
amnesty Monday. More than 1,000 prisoners were released, including
52 political offenders.
   The government says all political prisoners have been freed
except for dissidents convicted of violent crimes or communism.
   Hailing as a turning point South Korea's successful role as host
for the Olympics, Roh said he would renew efforts to improve
relations with North Korea during his single five-year term in
office, which ends in 1992.
   ``During my tenure, I will endeavor to bring about a spring of
reconciliation between the South and the North, which have remained
in a deep freeze for 40 years,'' he said.
   The 56-year-old president, who was elected in December, did not
disclose unification proposals but said he was willing to meet Kim
``at any place and at the earliest possible date to discuss any and
all issues.''
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
pro-Western South Korea in 1945, at the end of World War II. The
two sides fought a war in the 1950s, and the United States still
maintains 42,000 troops in the South. Parliamentary officials of
the two Koreas are to resume unification talks Oct. 13 at the truce
village of Panmunjom near the border. The last round of talks in
August ended without any progress.
   In early September, Kim said he would not meet Roh unless the
South accepts North Korea's unification formula, which calls for
the two Korean states to keep their different political and social
systems while operating as one nation under a confederation. The
North Korean leader also demanded that the two countries'
legislatures issue a joint non-aggression agreement.
   Seoul officials rejected the demands as a ploy to weaken South
Korea and eventually unify the peninsula under communist rule.
   Roh said his country would soon propose a new unification
formula which would be ``practicable and acceptable to both
sides,'' but he gave no details.
   Roh also said South Korea, which has recently exchanged trade
offices with Hungary and Yugoslavia, would continue trying to
improve relations with the Soviet Union and other communist
countries.

   NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics dominated
two weeks of prime time but concluded Sunday with an average rating
below the guarantee NBC gave advertisers, and that will cost the
network millions.
   NBC, which paid more than $300 million for the rights to the
Olympics, won't comment on the loss, but the Wall Street Journal
reported the network will have to give as much as $70 million in
commercial time to advertisers who didn't get as high a rating as
they were promised.
   The 15 nights of Olympics coverage from Seoul _ not counting the
opening and closing ceremonies _ averaged a 17.9 rating. NBC had
promised advertisers 21.2. The 1984 summer games on ABC had
averaged 23.2.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions.
   NBC began giving advertisers free spots during the second week
of the Olympics. A 30-second spot during prime-time coverage cost
$330,000.
   Nevertheless, six nights of Olympics coverage took up six places
in the top 10 in the A.C. Nielsen ratings for the week ending Oct.
2 and gave NBC a decisive win for the week with a 17.5 rating to
ABC's 12.3 and CBS' 11.2.
   ``The actual performance by the Olympics in key groups (of
viewers) was a really dominant performance. Whether it was as
dominant as anticipated, that's something else,'' said Gerald
Jaffe, NBC vice president for research projects.
   He said NBC intended to research the reason for the low-rated
performance, but would not likely make the results public. The time
difference between the United States and Korea, the late September
timing of the event and a general decline in network ratings are
likely contributors.
   CBS and ABC rebounded against the Olympics on Sunday when the
closing ceremonies had a lowly 12.3 rating. NBC had expected closer
to 20.0. CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and the
theatrical movie ``Cocoon'' out-rated the Olympics on Sunday, as
did ABC's made-for-TV movie ``Liberace.'' Those four shows made up
the rest of the top 10.
   The first week of the Olympics, ratings climbed as the week wore
on. The second week, they tended to decline. Last Monday night's
coverage was the highest-rated show of the week, with a 19.3 rating
and a 32 share. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   Tuesday's coverage was second, followed by Thursday's coverage,
``60 Minutes,'' Wednesday Olympics, ``Cocoon,'' ``Liberace,''
``Murder, She Wrote,'' Friday Olympics and Saturday Olympics.
   The Sunday closing ceremonies ranked 22nd out of 55 shows.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won in the news Nielsens with a
rating of 10.0 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' was second
with a 9.8 and 20. ``NBC Nightly News,'' pre-empted on the West
Coast by Olympics coverage, had a 9.6 and 21.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``Live! Dick
Clark Presents,'' ``Wiseguy,'' ``Mutts,'' ``Beauty & the Beast,''
``Equalizer,'' ``Mr. Belvedere _ Sunday,'' ``Deal of the Century,''
``Frank's Place,'' ``First Impressions'' and a paid political
program by Lyndon LaRouche.

<HEAD>Radioactivity Helps Scientists Track Michigan's Moose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUGHTON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radioactive fallout that drifted over
Isle Royale decades ago is helping researchers learn more about the
moose and wolves that inhabit the island in Lake Superior.
   Atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons before 1963 in the western
United States and the Soviet Union left traces of radioactive
carbon 14 in vegetation on the island.
   Moose that consumed that vegetation began bearing traces of
carbon 14 in their bones and teeth, giving scientists a way to
track the migration of herds, said Rolf Peterson, leader of a
Michigan Technological University research team.
   ``We've collected the bones from almost 1,900 moose that have
died from various causes on Isle Royale over the past 30 years,''
Peterson said.
   ``We want to measure the amount of carbon 14 in their teeth and
use it as a marker to determine each individual's year of birth and
the herd's survival patterns and population age structure.''
   The study might help researchers better understand the role of
Michigan's estimated 1,600 moose in a food chain that includes
timber wolves, Peterson said.
   ``We believe the nutritional state of moose in winter largely
determines their lifelong ability to survive,'' he said. ``That in
turn determines the amount of food available for wolves _ and
ultimately wolf density.
   ``We hope the information we're gathering now will not only tell
us more about the moose herd but, when combined with existing data,
will also help us explain long-term fluctuations in the wolf
population on Isle Royale.''
   Peterson said the atmospheric bomb tests, banned since 1963,
doubled the amount of carbon 14 in the atmosphere. Today's level is
still about 20 percent higher than before the tests began, he said.
   ``It's a reminder of how long-lasting this stuff actually is,''
he said. ``We've got it in our teeth, too.''
   Peterson said the studies might also determine if the 1986
reactor accident at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear power
plant affected Michigan's moose.
   Peterson, who has studied moose and wolf populations for 18
years, said the three-year study is being financed by a $150,000
grant from the National Science Foundation.

<HEAD>Israel Builds Up Lebanese Militia, Cuts Back Its Forces</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS graf 2, second sentence, to attribute troop
reductions to Israeli media reports, not Israeli commanders</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BINT JBAIL, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The frustration of Israeli soldiers
in southern Lebanon is reflected by a sentence scrawled in blue ink
on the walls of an outpost: ``Living in a dangerous area until the
end of time.''
   But a relative calm has settled in south Lebanon in recent
months, and there are indications of change in the Israeli
involvement. Israeli media reports say some army units have been
withdrawn and hint more cuts may be in the offing.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to strike at PLO forces and ended
three years of occupation in June 1985. It withdrew the bulk of its
forces but left behind what foreign reports estimated to be about
1,200 troops to help the South Lebanon Army patrol a security zone
north of the Israeli border.
   The Israeli commanders attribute the improved situation to a
reorganized and better trained South Lebanon Army, or SLA, a
2,000-member force of Lebanese militiamen.
   Lt. Col. Shraga Kurz, an Israeli liaison officer, spoke
glowingly of the SLA's performance in recent battles with
Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters.
   ``We are reducing Israeli units to the degree that the SLA can
take control of the area. You find less and less Israeli
soldiers,'' he said, confirming published reports that an
unspecified number of troops had already been withdrawn.
   SLA commander Antoine Lahad, 61, a Christian who studied at the
Ecole de Guerre in France and at Ft. Benning, Ga., claimed
Hezbollah was losing influence as his force was building.
   ``The strength of Hezbollah is not something of its own but
imported from Iran. Iran's failure to win the war with Iraq has
resulted in a weakening of morale of the Hezbollah forces in
Lebanon,'' he said.
   The SLA underwent a similar collapse in 1985 after Israel
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in the face of an
increasingly violent Shiite guerrilla campaign. Hezbollah overran
seven SLA positions, capturing men and weapons.
   But since March 1986, the SLA has not lost a single position,
despite 38 attacks that have killed 160 SLA men and wounded 550.
   Lahad said the number of attacks on his forces fell from 90 to
about 15 a month on average, and Hezbollah guerrillas were no
longer launching frontal assaults on SLA positions.
   His predominantly Christian force has also had success in
recruiting Shiites, who make up about 22 percent of the fighters.
In the last induction, Lahad said 80 of 170 recruits were Shiite.
Reporters were later introduced to a Shiite officer named Fuaz.
   Perhaps the most striking sign of Israeli confidence was that
reporters were allowed for the first time to visit the Shiite
sector where SLA influence has been the weakest in the past.
   In this Shiite town of 10,000 about five miles north of the
border, children ran to the side of the road to wave at army jeeps
escorting journalists. Townspeople smiled, but journalists were not
allowed to stop for interviews.
   The SLA has been considered by many observers to be a token
force, but Kurz said it has improved vastly in the past 18 months.
   SLA recruits now undergo a 12-week training course, three times
longer than previously. Some have studied artillery, infantry and
communications at Israeli bases, Kurz said.
   Economic incentives were provided to allow relatives of SLA
militiamen to take jobs in Israel, where 1,700 work, and annual
bonuses were paid to fighters who re-enlist.
   Within certain guidelines, Kurz said SLA units were operating on
their own against Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, and Israeli
advisers were spending most of their time teaching. ``This wasn't
the situation a couple of years ago,'' he said.
   Maj. Eitan, commander of a unit operating in southern Lebanon,
told reporters he exercised tight control over SLA units and said
it might be several years before the militiamen can be fully
independent. In accordance with Israeli army regulations, he did
not give his first name.
   ``They are given strict orders not to go into houses or shoot
carelessly. We remember Sabra and Chatilla,'' he said, a reference
to the 1982 massacre of more than 800 Palestinian civilians by
Israeli-allied Christian militiamen in Beirut refugee camps.
   The Israeli army has refused to specify how many soldiers are in
south Lebanon now or how many have been withdrawn recently.
   Deputy army Spokesman Renaan Gissin said units are sent in on
missions that can  or a few days and that very few
are permanently stationed in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Nigerian Girl To Be Sent Home; Loses Court Fight To Stay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old Nigerian girl has lost her
court fight to stay in the United States and will be returned to
her native country despite her claims that her father will abuse
her.
   U.S. District Judge William Cambridge on Monday denied a court
order sought to prevent Omalara Oyesiji's deportation. She was
taken into custody as she left court.
   Her court-appointed guardian, attorney Susan Koenig-Cramer, had
sought the court order. Cambridge also declined to delay the
effective date of his decision so Mrs. Koenig-Cramer could appeal.
   Miss Oyesiji came to the United States in March 1987 with her
stepmother after her father, a doctor from Lagos, Nigeria, enrolled
in courses at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
   The girl ran away from home in September 1987, alleging her
father had abused her physically, according to court records. She
was placed in a youth group home in Bellevue and remained there
after her father and stepmother returned unexpectedly to Nigeria
last December.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service began
deportation proceedings in March, contending she had entered the
country only because her father was studying here. When he left,
she also should be required to leave, immigration officials said.
   Miss Oyesiji appeared at a deportation hearing in April and was
given until July to depart voluntarily. In July, immigration
officials declined her request for an extension of time to appeal.
   Mrs. Koenig-Cramer filed two actions in federal court to delay
the deportation, and the action was held up until Monday's hearing.
   During the hearing, Miss Oyesiji testified that her father had
beat her and her younger brother when they lived in Nigeria and in
Omaha.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Madgett said Miss Oyesiji's
attorney failed to prove immigration officials abused their
discretion when they denied her request for an extension of time to
leave voluntarily. That is the only basis which the judge had to
block the administrative decision, Madgett said.
   James M. Cole, immigration service district director, said the
U.S. consul general in Lagos has been notified of the case and told
about the abuse reports. The consulate was asked to notify Nigerian
authorities ``so she will not be placed in an abusive situation,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   The fight over a second presidential debate
that erupted this week between the League of Women Voters and the
candidates could lead to no debates at all in 1992.
   In 1976, 1980, 1984 and now 1988, face-to-face confrontations
between the presidential candidates have highlighted the fall
campaigns.
   It is that very success that may spell an end to the encounters.
   Debates are so important that campaigns do everything they can
to control them. In this grab for control, the campaigns of George
Bush and Michael Dukakis crushed the fragile institutional
structure that had grown up around the debates.
   The campaigns moved forcefully this year to dictate every detail
of the debate process, down to the height of the lecterns and the
seating of reporters in the hall.
   There was a report in The Washington Post on Tuesday that this
control extended to a Bush campaign effort to strong-arm moderator
Jim Lehrer in the middle of the first debate last month to change
the line of questioning.
   League president Nancy Neuman said Monday her group could not be
a party to such ``manipulation'' of the debate process and withdrew
its sponsorship of the debate scheduled next week in Los Angeles.
The campaigns are now scrambling to line up the debate there
anyway, using the screen of the debate commission they control
through the party committees.
   But control of podium height and camera angles is not the key
element of a campaign's influence on debates.
   Whether to debate at all is the key.
   Incumbent presidents _ and candidates leading in the polls _
often don't want to debate, knowing that a single misstep can
derail a campaign that was otherwise headed for victory.
   ``I think we're probably lucky, as Americans, that this race is
as close as it is,'' said Democratic consultant Robert Squier on
NBC's ``Today'' show. ``Because if this race were not close, I
think whoever was ahead would not be showing up in Los Angeles.''
   Debates have occurred in four straight presidential elections
because the pressure for debates was so strong that even the
candidates could not resist it.
   Part of this pressure came from the media, editorializing for
debates. Part of it came from campaigns that decide they can
benefit from debates.
   And part of the pressure has come from those institutions with a
stake in the debates. The primary institution has been the League,
sponsor of the debates in 1976, 1980 and 1984.
   The television networks have also had an institutional stake.
They sponsored the 1960 debates and offer frequently to take on the
role again. The League had barely withdrawn on Monday before the
networks offered to take on the sponsorship role.
   The political parties tried to grab an institutional role in the
debates, setting up a commission that sponsored the first one last
month and which is trying to put together the second one now.
   But that commission is a creature of the parties _ and thus of
the campaigns. Its continued existence is very much in doubt,
depending on the political needs of the winner of the November
election.
   And after the experience of 1988, it is by no means certain that
the League will want to dive back into the debate morass again.
   In 1992 there will be an incumbent president _ named Bush or
Dukakis _ running for re-election.
   The challenger will call for debates, early and often.
   The question is whether the incumbent can be forced into a
debate by a drumbeat of pressure from a neutral entity _ such as
the League.

   Mayor Janio Quadros has outlawed the
wearing of skimpy swimsuits in the name of ``morality.''
   Quadros on Monday banned so-called ``dental floss'' string
bikinis and men's brief swimwear in city parks in Sao Paulo, the
nation's second-largest city.
   Quadros, a former president of Brazil, was quoted in major
newspapers as saying the ban was not ``prudishness'' but intended
``to defend a minimum of morality and decency.''
   Quadros, who was president for seven months in 1961 and quit
suddenly for reasons he never explained, became famous for his
unusual decrees. As president he banned bikinis and cockfighting.
   The ``dental floss'' bikini is especially popular in Rio de
Janeiro. Sao Paulo has no beaches and is known as a conservative,
all-business city.

   Police have begun confiscating cars belonging to

either take a cab or public transportation home _ or call a friend
or spouse for a ride.
   The crackdown began Monday in an effort to control the city's
longstanding problem with prostitution.
   Under the program, officers who arrest prostitutes' customers
will keep their cars even after the offenders are released.
   Police said they will ask for court permission to keep the
vehicles permanently.
   Several vehicles have already been seized, police said.

   The U.S. Postal Service announced a $12.9
billion program Tuesday for investment in new facilities, buildings
and equipment over the next five years.
   The spending, including nearly $450 million for new vending
machines, lobby equipment and other customer service projects, was
approved by the agency's board of governors, meeting in Richmond,
Va.
   Some of the spending will compensate for projects shelved last
fall when Congress ordered postal spending curtailed in the 1988
and 1989 fiscal years in an effort to lower the overall total of
the federal budget.
   The new five-year plan includes $4.2 billion for new, automated
mail processing equipment to help cope with the rising tide of mail.
   Mail volume, currently about 160 billion pieces annually, is
expected to top 225 billion by the year 2000.
   The plan also calls for spending of $6.7 billion for purchase or
repair of several major mail facilities across the country, $1.2
billion for customer service and administration projects and $443
million for purchase of new vehicles.
   While the governors approved the overall plan for the five-year
period, individual projects will still require review by the board.

   A private fund drive to finance Wednesday's
vice presidential debate has fallen more than $200,000 short of its
goal, city officials said Tuesday.
   Kevin Collison, a spokesman for Mayor Walter Calinger, said
officials had raised only $540,000 toward the minimum cost of
$750,000 expected for the debate between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle.
   He said the ``worst case'' cost of the debate has been estimated
at $900,000, but that city officials have no idea whether costs are
staying within budget.
   Collison has said funds left over from a defunct city-county
lottery could be used to cover debate costs if the fund drive fails
to meet its goal.

<TEXT>
   Discovery's five astronauts got the
day off Tuesday after the first shuttle mission since the
Challenger disaster, but go back to work Wednesday for a week of
debriefings on what NASA calls one of its most successful flights.
   The astronauts returned home Monday night to welcome-home
festivities at Ellington Field airport that rivaled those given to
earlier space heroes. The red-carpet rally included bands, balloons
and speeches celebrating America's first manned spaceflight in 32
months.
   Commander Frederick Hauck told the crowd of about 5,000
flag-waving well-wishers the Challenger accident ``made us resolved
to recover from that, and we have done that.''
   Hauck guided the 97-ton shuttle to a pinpoint landing on a dry
lakebed runway at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 9:37 a.m. PDT
Monday.
   Discovery's four-day flight, a test of the space agency's
massive effort to redesign the shuttle after Challenger exploded,
was nearly flawless from takeoff to touchdown and the shuttle
itself suffered only some minor wear, NASA officials said.
   After resting for a day and visiting with their families, the
astronauts return Wednesday to the Johnson Space Center to begin
briefings with management and ground controllers about the four-day
mission, spokesman Steve Nesbitt said.
   ``They will go over all the details of the flight while their
memories are still fresh,'' Nesbitt said.
   The other crew members are pilot Richard Covey, John M. Lounge,
David C. Hilmers and George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson.
   Nesbitt said the astronauts later will make public appearances
across the country to discuss the flight.
   The flight followed more than 400 changes to the shuttle system,
many for safety reasons, in one of the biggest redesign and testing
programs ever attempted by NASA.
   More than $800 million was spent on renovating the solid fuel
rocket boosters alone. It was a flawed rocket that caused
Challenger to explode 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its seven crew members.
   Discovery's boosters were recovered from the sea and are being
carefully disassembled at Cape Canaveral. Preliminary checks have
``showed that the boosters held up real well, there were no signs
of leaks or failures,'' Kennedy Space Center spokesman Karl
Kristofferson said Tuesday.
   After the boosters are taken apart, the pieces will be sent to
Utah to Morton Thiokol Inc., the manufacturer, for a more detailed
examination of their performance, Kristofferson said.
   The shuttle was being readied Tuesday for a piggyback ride back
to Florida aboard a modified Boeing 747. That flight is scheduled
for Saturday.
   Ted Ayers, deputy site manager for NASA's Dryden Flight Research
Facility at Edwards, said Discovery lost six heat-shield tiles, but
this poses a danger only if they are in an area that undergoes
intense heating during re-entry.
   In addition, Ayers said, ``We've got some normal dings in the
tile under the vehicle. These are nicks from dirt particles on the
lakebed.''

<HEAD>AIDS Survey Will Target Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health authorities have decided to
focus on Allegheny County, Pa., _ the Pittsburgh area _ in their
efforts for a voluntary door-to-door AIDS survey that could lead to
a more comprehensive national survey, an official said today.
   Public Health Service Jim Brown said the Centers for Disease
Control, a part of PHS, turned their attention to Pittsburgh after
District of Columbia health officials and other community leaders
complained that the sampling planned for the capital city appeared
to be unfairly targeted at black neighborhoods.
   The plan is for federal and local health officials to approach
residents to ask for a blood sample to test for AIDS in an effort
to get a more scientific handle on how much the virus has spread.
   The idea is to do the sampling much the way polls are conducted
so a representative portion of the population is tested. But
instead of being asked questions, the people selected for the
survey will be asked to let their blood be tested for AIDS.
   The blood samples would not be identified by name.
   Top federal health officials have been skeptical that enough
people would submit to the voluntary testing to enable them to get
a representative sampling on a national basis.
   The Pittsburgh study is designed not so much to learn the extent
of AIDS infection in that area as to determine whether sampling
techniques can be developed that would make a national survey
worthwhile.

violence, techniques to avert these acts and the appropriate role
of community groups and governments at all levels.
   The commission would report to Congress and the president within

three by the speaker of the House and three by the majority leader

<HEAD>House Kills Bill to Review Detention of Cubans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday killed a move to
establish procedures to review the continued detention of Cubans
who entered the United States during the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   Under legislation defeated by a 271-144 vote, Mariel aliens
denied parole would have been given the right to a hearing before
an administrative law judge.
   The hearing would have been required within 90 days after the
end of a Justice Department review, or within 90 days of the
alien's detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The legislation provided that to continue detention, the
department would have to prove that the detainee would pose a
threat to the community or would violate reasonable conditions of
release.
   Aliens released under the legislation would only have been sent
to a halfway house or to a suitable sponsor.
   Mariel Cubans not released under the procedures would have had
annual reviews, to determine whether circumstances justified
reopening hearings.
   More than 125,000 Cubans came to the United States between April
and October 1980, when Cuba opened its port of Mariel for citizens
wishing to leave. The group included many people with criminal
records and mental illness.
   Last year, Cuban detainees rioted at the Oakdale correctional
facility in Louisiana and the federal prison in Atlanta after the
United States and Cuba agreed to resume a migration agreement. At
the time, there were 2,500 Cubans waiting for repatriation.
   In the wake of the riots, a new Justice Department review
program was started for detainees designated for repatriation, and
those denied parole by the INS.

   Amnesty International criticized the United States
on Wednesday for executing a man diagnosed as mentally retarded and
for jailing a church worker who smuggled Salvadoran aliens into the
country.
   In its annual global survey, the international human rights
organization said 25 murderers were put to death by lethal
injection, electrocution or in the gas chamber in eight states last
year.
   A total of 1,982 prisoners were under sentence of death in 34
states in December 1987, it said.
   The London-based group opposes the death penalty on grounds it
is inhuman punishment.
   Its annual report said that John Brogdon, who was executed in
Louisiana on July 30, 1987 for the rape and murder of a child, had
been diagnosed as mentally retarded with a mental age of 10.
   Billy Mitchell, executed in Georgia on Sept. 1, 1987, also was
reported to have been suffering from a serious mental disorder, the
report said.
   It said Edward Earl Johnson, a black youth convicted of killing
a white police officer, was executed despite ``substantial doubts''
about his guilt raised by defense lawyers. Further evidence in
support of Johnson's innocence has emerged since his execution in
Mississippi on May 25, 1987, the report said.
   Amnesty International said it wrote to the governors of Georgia
and nine other states to protest ``marked racial disparities in
death sentencing'' after a Supreme Court ruling on the issue in
April 1987.
   The court voted 5-4 to deny an appeal on behalf of a black
prisoner, Warren McCleskey, which cited a study showing black
defendants convicted of killing white victims in Georgia were
several times more likely to receive death sentences than those
convicted of killing blacks.
   Amnesty said it adopted church worker Stacey Merkt as a prisoner
of conscience after she was convicted in 1985 of transporting and
conspiring to transport illegal aliens.
   Merkt started serving an 18-month sentence in Janaury 1987 but
was released in April to serve the rest of her sentence under house
arrest, which was lifted three months later, it said.
   Amnesty International, which defines a prisoner of conscience as
a person imprisoned for non-violent political activity, said it
believed the Salvadoran aliens were in danger of being imprisoned,
tortured or unlawfully executed if sent back to their homeland.
   Amnesty said it found ``serious inadequacies'' in the
investigation of alleged mistreatment of prisoners at Marion
maximum-security prison in Illinois in November 1983. It
recommended that the authorities conduct an independent inquiry.

   The United States must revamp outdated
government regulations and tax policies to boost the ability of
American businesses to compete internationally, a new study
concluded Tuesday.
   The Committee for Economic Development, a group of 200 U.S.
business leaders and educators, said that too often American
politicians characterize increased global trade as a threat rather
than an opportunity.
   ``As a result, they do not recognize the need to reform outmoded
policies that were developed in an era when most Americans felt
they had little stake in foreign economic developments,'' the
report said.
   The study said that an increasingly integrated world economy
posed problems for American businesses and workers. It said special
attention was needed for retraining workers in declining industries
and improving the U.S. education system.
   ``In a highly integrated global economy, a nation that falls
behind in the education and training of its labor force will not
remain a leading economic power,'' the report said.
   The group singled out the 1986 Tax Reform Act as one example of
legislation enacted with little attention to its impact on the
ability of U.S. companies to compete abroad. The group criticized
the elimination of various tax benefits for business investments,
saying these changes had raised the cost of capital in the United
States.
   Tax overhaul supporters argued that the changes eliminated
loopholes and lowered overall tax rates, thus creating a fairer tax
structure.
   The study said that a host of U.S. budget and tax policies as
well as federal regulations need to be revised.
   In addition to changes in the tax code to boost capital
investment, the report recommended changes in the international
regulation of financial markets, better protection for U.S.
copyrights and patents and a review of the impact anti-trust laws
have on the ability of American corporations to compete
internationally.
   The study, titled ``New Dynamics in the Global Economy,'' was
written by Isaiah Frank, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins
Univeristy, and William J. Beeman, a vice president at the Council
for Economic Development.
   Owen B. Butler, retired chairman of the Proctor & Gamble Corp.,
is head of the non-profit council. The council receives support
from businesses, foundations and individuals.

   Bank teller Tina Gaddy says she wants a
guarantee that her typewriter is snake-free.
   Snake-free?
   Ms. Gaddy, who works at Woodland Bank, said she was adjusting
the paper in her typewriter Monday when her finger touched
something, but not the keyboard.
   She looked up and found herself eye-to-eye with a small garden
snake.
   The snake, she said, was inside the typewriter, with his head
sticking out a hole in the keyboard.
   ``I can handle snakes on the street, but not in my typewriter,''
she said.
   Ms. Gaddy and her co-workers tried, without success, to lure the
serpent out of the machine. They finally left the typewriter in a
box for the repair person.
   Her supervisors have promised her a reptile-free typewriter, but
Ms. Gaddy said she plans to check it out herself.
   ``I'm paranoid now,'' she said. ``I'm not using that same
typewriter unless they can assure me there's no snake in it.''

   A pink marble monument honoring ``King
Neptune,'' a 700-pound pig which helped raise $19 million in war
bonds during World War II, will be replaced and relocated as a
symbol of Illinois' patriotism.
   Local officials decided Monday to replace the vandalized
monument that now stands over the pig's grave and move it about a
mile from Illinois 146 to a rest area along Interstate 57, where it
will be more visible to tourists.
   From 1942-46, Navy officials used the black pig as a gimmick to
sell war bonds in southern Illinois. The pig would be repeatedly
``sold'' at auction, but instead of keeping the porker, bidders
agreed to buy the amount of their bids in war bonds to help build
the battleship USS Illinois.
   King Neptune gained fame for wearing a fringe Navy blanket,
silver earrings, leather boots and a gold crown in the middle of
his back.
   When he died of pneumonia at age 9 in 1950, the pig was buried
with full military honors. Representatives of all five branches of
the armed forces attended the funeral.

   A Navy helicopter on maneuvers disappeared from
radar screens and apparently crashed into the ocean early today.
The four crew members were missing and presumed dead, the Navy said.
   The SH-3H Sea King helicopter was believed to have gone down
shortly after midnight about 80 miles off San Diego, said Fred
Wilson, a spokesman at North Island Naval Air Station.
   Wilson said three aircraft and three ships began a search after
the crew failed to check in by radio.
   ``They don't know what happened but they have found wreckage,''
he said.
   The helicopter was conducting ``plane guard'' duty for the
aircraft carrier USS Ranger in which choppers take to the air so
they will be in position to rescue fliers if their planes go down.

<HEAD>Witness: Hamadi Shoved Pistol In His Face, Pulled Back The Hammer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy diver held hostage on
a hijacked TWA jet said Tuesday that Mohammed Ali Hamadi shoved a
cocked pistol at his face and was ready to shoot until a flight
attendant begged him to stop.
   Another witness testified that he believed Hamadi fired the shot
that killed Robert Stethem, an American sailor.
   ``He (Hamadi) had a chrome-plated automatic pistol in his hand.
He pointed it directly in my face and pulled back the hammer,''
Tony Daniel Watson said. ``I was very afraid I would be shot,''
Watson, 30, told the Frankfurt court trying Hamadi.
   He said Uli Derickson, the chief flight attendant, pleaded with
Hamadi in German to stop. Mrs. Derickson has been credited with
negotiating with Hamadi in German in attempts to prevent
mistreatment of passengers.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused in the June 1985
hijacking in which Stethem, also a Navy diver, was killed and 39
Americans were held captive for 17 days. Hamadi has admitted taking
part in the hijacking but said he had nothing to do with Stehem's
murder.
   Stethem's supervisor, Stuart Dahl, testified that he believed
Hamadi was the one who shot Stethem, even though he did not see who
fired the shot.
   Dahl, 34, shaking his finger and pointing directly at Hamadi,
said: ``I know he was the one that hit me on the back of the head.
Although I did not see him ... I would say he was the one who did
it (the shooting).''
   ``He (Hamadi) was proud of it. He looked like the fox that got
the chicken. He showed absolutely no remorse,'' the American sailor
said.
   Dahl said ``not more than a minute after the shooting,'' Hamadi
came to where he was sitting in the airplane and hit him on the
back of the head with the butt of the gun.
   ```Hey you,' he said, `get up.' We then made eye contact and he
said `sit down.' He was very proud of his power, he was very proud
of what he had done,'' said Dahl.
   Hamadi listened intently to the testimony with one arm propped
on the desk in front of him, his chin resting in his left hand.
   Flight 847's pilot, John Testrake, told the court several weeks
ago that he believed Hamadi was the gunman.
   Other witnesses have said they believed the other hijacker,
identified by a U.S. indictment as Hassan Ezzeddine, was the killer.
   Watson also testified that he recognized the picture of a man
now jailed in France as one of the men holding him hostage during
the Athens-to-Rome flight in June 1985.
   Watson was shown the picture of a man identified in court
records as Fuad Ali Salah. Salah was arrested on March 27, 1987 in
France on suspicion of taking part in terrorist bombings in Paris,
according to evidence introduced in court.
   ``I saw him twice while we were being held captive in Beirut,''
Watson said.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   Within a week, two West German businessmen were kidnapped in
Beirut. Both have been released.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Hamadi, is imprisoned in West
Germany. He was convicted earlier this year by a Duesseldorf court
of conspiracy in the abduction of the two West Germans. Abbas
Hamadi was accused of arranging the kidnappings in an effort to
pressure the West German government to release his brother.

<HEAD>Flooding Of Telephone Repeater Station Cuts Contact With Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLATHE, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regional air traffic control center
covering an oval-shaped area stretching from Denver to Indianapolis
lost contact with about 150 planes for 27 minutes during a
communications center flood last week, Federal Aviation
Administration officials said.
   The heavy rains Sept. 28 caused the outage from 7:23 p.m. to
7:50 p.m. at Southwestern Bell's telephone repeater station in
Shawnee, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo.
   The station serves the FAA's Kansas City Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Olathe, another Kansas City suburb. The outage
occurred at a time when controllers were working with 250 aircraft,
many seeking instructions to avoid the heavy thunderstorms.
   The controllers switched to backup radio frequencies and
notified officials in Washington who control the national airspace
flow. There, officials either delayed or rerouted planes from
across the nation that were scheduled to fly through the center's
airspace. More than 30 airliners were held on the ground at
airports across the Midwest for up to 45 minutes.
   However, controllers lost contact with some planes already in
the sky because some backup radio systems failed, the FAA said
Monday.
   ``It was a serious and significant outage,'' said Bob
Raynesford, spokesman for the FAA's Central Region in Kansas City.
   He said, however, that there were no near collisions or other
problems.
   Felton Lancaster, chief of the Olathe center, said that in many
sectors controllers were able to switch to emergency transmitters,
but in some cases the backup lines went through the station in
Shawnee as well.
   ``The more complicated technology gets, the least little error
can have disastrous consequences,'' Lancaster said. ``But with
enough backup systems built in, I'm certain we can handle anything
that comes along.''
   Officials said there was a similar incident involving the
Shawnee repeater station last year. FAA and phone company officials
have met to determine what might be done to prevent another outage.

   A Michelangelo drawing of the suicide of
Cleopatra, discovered only last August, will go on display for the
first time on Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, Director J.
Carter Brown said Tuesday.
   The new drawing had not been noticed before because it was on
the reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a
backing. Conservators decided that the well-known drawing, which
also depicts the ancient Egyptian ruler, was not being preserved
properly on the backing, so it was removed.
   ``When they did, to everyone's great delight they were able to
reveal the fact that there was this drawing on the reverse, which
was also of Cleopatra, but in a very different mood,'' said Brown.
   The well-known drawing on the front illustrates the traditional
story of her suicide, in which she had an asp brought to her in a
basket of figs and put it on her arm. It shows the snake biting her
breast. Cleopatra's hair is carefully dressed and her expression is
calm and melancholy.
   The newly-found drawing, much less finished, shows her hair in
disorder, her eyes staring out at the viewer and her mouth open as
if in a scream.
   Bernard Berenson, the American critic, spent much of his life in
Florence, Italy, studying Michelangelo and other painters of the
period. At the turn of this century, he questioned whether the
drawing on the front was by Michelangelo, suggesting that it might
be by a collaborator he called ``Andrea di Michelangelo.''
   Later critics have become convinced that Michelangelo himself
did the drawing.
   ``There is no such person as Andrea di Michelangelo,'' said
Giuseppina Ragionieri, director of the Casa Buonarotti, the
Florence museum lodged in what was once the painter's home.
   She has come to Washington for the exhibit ``Michaelangelo:
Draftsman@Architect.'' The largest showing of his graphic work ever
mounted in this country, it will be at the gallery's West Building
until Dec. 11.
   Cleopatra killed herself in the year 30 B.C. to avoid being
taken to Rome and put on display by the man who later became the
Emperor Augustus. He had defeated Cleopatra and her lover, Mark
Antony, in the great naval battle of Actium the year before.
   Her story has been told many times in art and literature,
including Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
   Michelangelo drew her some time before 1534, about 70 years
earlier than Shakespeare's play.

   Discovery's astronauts came home to
a hero's welcome after a nearly flawless mission that returned
Americans to space, and urged space center workers to ``make this
adventure happen again.''
   NASA officials hailed the four-day mission as a ``stunning
success'' that verified NASA's massive effort to redesign the space
shuttle after the Challenger disaster 32 months ago.
   Discovery commander Frederick Hauck, speaking Monday night to a
crowd of nearly 5,000 flag-waving Johnson Space Center workers,
called the Challenger accident a ``tremendous loss ... that
affected us very deeply.''
   ``It also made us resolved to recover from that, and we have
done that,'' Hauck added.
   ``We will never forget'' the seven astronauts who died when
Challenger exploded, he said. ``We will always remember the
sacrifice that they made.''
   Hauck guided the 97-ton shuttle through cloudless skies to a
pinpoint touchdown on the center line of the desert runway at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 9:37 a.m. PDT Monday.
   In the most festive welcome home since early in the shuttle
program, space center workers, their families and friends lined the
Ellington Field runway Monday evening to cheer as the astronauts
stepped from two slick blue and white Gulfstream jets.
   Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and astronauts John M. Lounge, David
C. Hilmers and George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson, and their wives walked
down a red carpet between two rows of flag-waving drill team
members while a high school band played the theme from ``Star
Wars.''
   ``We just got back from the greatest adventure of our lives,''
Hilmers said. ``Each one of us knows where our place in the future
is, where Americans should be _ it's in space. So let's go back to
work tomorrow and make this adventure happen again, and again and
again.''
   The next shuttle flight is set for late November, when Atlantis
is to be launched on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Discovery landed smoothly on a dry lakebed in the Mojave Desert,
completing a 1.68-million-mile voyage that lasted four days, one
hour and 57 seconds.
   The landing was witnessed by more than 300,000 people. Many
waved American flags and ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was played
over loudspeakers.
   Hauck, waving a large American flag, led his crewmates through a
hatch and down a ramp to the runway, where they were greeted by
Vice President George Bush and top National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials.
   At a welcoming ceremony, Bush said he was proud to ``welcome the
space shuttle Discovery back to earth, back to America, and back to
the future.''
   He said the crew had shown that ``the shuttle is a strong bird
and it could and should fly again.''
   In a post-landing news conference, NASA shuttle boss Richard
Truly called the mission ``an absolutely stunning success.''
   He said the $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, the
primary payload of Discovery's mission, has rocketed itself ``to
precisely where we want it.''
   Six of Discovery's heat-shield tiles were gouged, apparently by
debris during the launch, and others sustained ``dings'' during the
four-day voyage, John ``Tip'' Talone, the shuttle processing
director, said today.
   He said officials weren't yet sure if the debris was ice that
formed on the outside of the cold external fuel tank. Discovery had
fewer ``dings'' to other tiles than first thought, Talone said,
although he said they hadn't been counted yet.
   ``The vehicle looks beautiful,'' he said. ``It looks probably as
good or better as any vehicle we've brought in here.''
   Discovery is to be ferried back to Kennedy Space Center in
Florida atop a Boeing 747 transport. Space transportation system
manager Arnold Aldrich said the shuttle should leave Edwards on
Saturday and arrive at Kennedy on Sunday after an overnight stop in
San Antonio, Texas.
   The first shuttle flight since the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger
disaster went as planned from beginning to end.
   Discovery rocketed into orbit Thursday, and the astronauts
launched the communications satellite five hours later.
   The astronauts conducted 11 experiments in orbit, took
photographs of weather patterns and features on Earth, and tested
new escape system equipment.
   On Sunday, they remembered their fallen Challenger colleagues by
taking turns reading an emotional message that was broadcast to
Earth.

   A man from Illinois and a woman from
Washington have reached the summit of Mount Everest, the world's
tallest peak, the Tourism Ministry announced Tuesday.
   It said Geoffrey Tabin, 32, a physician from Glencoe, Ill., and
Peggy Luce, 30, of Redmond, Wash., reached the top of the
29,028-foot peak Sunday morning.
   Their successful assault came a week after the first conquest of
Everest by an American woman, Stacy Allison, 30, of Portland, Ore.
She is a member of the same expedition as Tabin and Ms. Luce and
reached the summit with a Sherpa guide last Thursday.
   The 13-member expedition scaled the mountain from the southeast
ridge, via the south col, the route taken by Sir Edmund Hillary and
Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay in the first conquest of Everest in
1953. Leading the current group is James Frush, a lawyer and writer

   A masked man killed the father-in-law of
imprisoned Naples crime boss Raffaele Cutolo with two shotgun
blasts Tuesday as he left a barber shop, police reported.
   They said Salvatore Jacone, 54, was hit at close range and the
gunman, described as wearing a ski mask and sunglasses, fled.
   Cutolo is serving five life terms in prison. He married Jacone's
daughter Immacolata, 27, in a jailhouse ceremony four years ago.
   Jacone was killed in Ottaviano, a Naples suburb and the
stronghold of Cutolo's New Organized Camorra crime syndicate.
   The gang has fought a rival Camorra group for years for control
of the Naples rackets. The Italian news agency ANSA said the
killing Tuesday was the 127th in Naples this year.

   Lawyers for The Bible Speaks fundamentalist church
told a court Tuesday the First Amendment should have protected it
from a bankrupting order to return $6.6 million to an heiress who
claimed the pastor exploited her.
   Attorney Norman Roy Grutman told the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of
Appeals that Elizabeth Dovydenas was a ``healthy, well-educated
woman'' with a ``long history of charity and religion-inspired
gift-giving.''
   Mrs. Dovydenas, whose father heads the Dayton-Hudson department
store chain, was depicted by her attorney, Gordon Walker, as a
``susceptible, trusting person'' who formed dependent attachments
and relied heavily on her psychotherapist.
   Walker said that Mrs. Dovydenas was so enamored of her
grandfather, a Presbyterian minister, that she was confused to
learn he was not part of the Holy Trinity.
   Grutman argued that Mrs. Dovydenas was no more manipulated by
the Bible Speaks pastor, the Rev. Carl H. Stevens Jr., than she was
by the many other controlling influences in her life.
   Grutman termed Mrs. Dovydenas an ``apostate'' who had been
``fully committed'' to the church before she became a ``faith
breaker.'' He called her donations of money to Bible Speaks an
expression of ``religious solicitation'' that should be protected
under the First Amendment like all free speech.
   Mrs. Dovydenas sued the church for donations she made as a
parishioner from 1982 to 1986, contending she was lied to and that
her unquestioning trust was exploited by Stevens, the church's
founder. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court ordered the church to return her
money in April 1987 and the $6.6 million award was upheld by a
federal court judge.
   Walker described Stevens as plotting a ``vicious scheme''
designed to foster Mrs. Dovydenas' dependence on him and create an
``atmosphere of fear.'' Walker said that Stevens told Mrs.
Dovydenas that her family was ``demonic.''
   Last March, Mrs. Dovydenas won ownership of the church's 65-acre
headquarters in Lenox with a $3.23 million bid at an auction in
federal Bankruptcy Court. She and her husband, Jonas Dovydenas,
have said that they plan to sell some of the church property to
developers and turn some of it into a school and a community center
for the wealthy town, the summer home of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
   The Bible Speaks had claimed 1,200 members worldwide until it
disbanded in the summer of 1987. Stevens has since moved to the
Baltimore area, where the church has been revived under the name
The Greater Grace.

Help</HEAD>

   Security forces killed 12 people caught
looting or stealing Tuesday, government radio said, and an
opposition leader appealed to Amnesty International to help bring
democracy to Burma.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said soldiers opened fire on a group of
people looting a food warehouse in Rangoon and killed 10. Soldiers
killed two more people caught stealing iron roofing in another part
of the capital, the report said.
   The deaths brought to more than 440 the number of people
officials say have died since military officers seized control
Sept. 18 and cracked down on anti-government demonstrators and
looters.
   Anti-government strikes that began in August have seriously
disrupted supplies of food and other items to the capital.
   In a letter to Amnesty International, Tin Oo, a former defense
minister and the vice chairman of the opposition National League
for Democracy, cited the killing of demonstrators, denial of labor
union rights and removal from office of many government officials
for taking part in recent anti-government protests.
   Copies of the letter were distributed to reporters.
   ``All the opposition leaders are now facing arrest and other
punitive measures,'' the letter said. ``We therefore request you to
do your best for the restoration of human rights and democracy in
the country.''
   Opposition leaders and Western diplomats in Rangoon say some
lower-ranking opposition leaders have been arrested.
   Under threat of dismissal, government employees reported to work
Tuesday, but by midday many workers had returned home, some saying
there was no work to do.
   The government ordered all civil servants to return to their
jobs Monday, ending a monthlong general strike _ the first mass
labor agitation since former ruler Ne Win seized power in 1962 and
instituted a military-backed, one-party system.
   Ne Win resigned in July and was replaced by Sein Lwin, a
hard-line military leader. He, too, resigned after massive
pro-democracy protests in August and September, and was replaced by
Maung Maung, a civilian. Saw Maung, the current leader, ousted
Maung Maung.
   Students continued sporadic demonstrations against military rule
in residential areas of east Rangoon on Tuesday, but no arrests
were reported.
   Tin Oo said the government had not yet responded to a request by
the National League for Democracy for a meeting with authorities to
discuss proposals for free elections.
   The government has promised general elections and allowed
political parties to register, thus formally breaking the monopoly
on power held by the Burma Socialist Program Party since 1962.
   However, that party, now renamed the National Unity Party, is
solidly entrenched and has a nationwide organizational network.
   State radio also reported Tuesday that the head of a
U.S.-supported guerrilla group fighting the Laotian communist
government was killed Sept. 19 in a clash with Burmese troops.
   The report identified the group as the Laotian Liberation Army
and said documents seized included a U.S. alien resident card and
an Illinois driver's license. It did not say whose name was on the
license or identify the guerrilla.
   The guerrilla was killed near Mong Pyak, about 20 miles west of
the Laotian border, the report said. The troops also seized a U.S.
flag and documents of a group called the Southeast Asian Freedom
Organization detailing plans to liberate communist nations such as
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

   A major quake on a fault zone through the
metropolitan area would trigger fires, collapse buildings, pour oil
and sewage into harbors and knock out many hospital beds, a
disaster worse than ``the Big One'' on the San Andreas Fault, a new
state report says.
   A quake on the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone measuring 7 on the
Richter scale ``poses one of the greatest hazards to life and
property in the nation,'' California's Division of Mines and
Geology said in the disaster scenario report issued Tuesday.
   The fault zone stretches 45 miles through the Los Angeles urban
everly Hills through Long Beach to Laguna Beach.
   The quake ``would cause markedly greater damage in metropolitan
Los Angeles and Orange counties than would a magnitude 8.3 along
the more distant San Anarea from near Bdreas Fault,'' said Joseph Ziony,
an
assistant director of the division's parent agency, the Department
of Conservation.
   The fault zone caused the 6.3-magnitude Long Beach earthquake in
1933 that killed 115 people and injured hundreds more. Scientists
don't know how often big quakes occur on the fault.
   ``There is no evidence this earthquake will occur in the near
future,'' Ziony said. ``We're providing this scenario as a worst
case for the LA Basin so that offi might be strong enough to open cracks
in
the ground, destroy most masonry buildings and severely damage
well-built wooden structures, the report said.
   Those areas are the Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor area, where
vibrations may turn the ground to quicksand in a process called
liquefaction; the 1.25-mile-wide fault zone itself; and
landslide-prone areas of the Santa Monica Mountains and Palos
Verdes Hills.
   ``A major fire rages for several days at one of the refineries
in the Carson-Wilmington area,'' the report projected. ``Fires
occur in the harbor area; these and ruptured oil storage facilities
pose the threat of a major fire.''
   Thousands of damaged natural gas mains would cause numerous
fires in streets, ruptured pipelines and storage tanks would pour
oil into Los Angeles Harbor, and sewage treatment would be halved
at Los Angeles County's main plants.
   Orange County's main sewage treatment plant ``will be inoperable
for several months,'' sending sewage flowing into soils, channels
and streets, contaminating ground water and the coastline, the
report said.
   It also predicted:
   _Damage to control towers, runways and fuel tanks at airports
including Los Alamitos, site of the state's earthquake emergency
command post. Damaged access routes to Los Angeles International
would reduce airport capacity as much as 30 percent for two days.
   _Blockages or damage to numerous highways, including Pacific
Coast Highway and several major freeways.
   _Wave damage to ships and moorings.
   _Severe disruption of phone service, including emergency lines.
   _Closure of many power plants and substations for more than
three days.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm nominees
for three top Justice Department posts, including replacements for
the two men who resigned last March 29 to protest the continued
tenure of then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   In voice votes, the Senate approved Harold G. Christensen as
deputy attorney general, Frank Keating as associate attorney
general, the No. 3 post in the department; and Edward S.G. Dennis
Jr., as an assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal
division.
   Christensen replaces Arnold Burns, who resigned out of concern
that Meese's continued tenure in the face of a criminal
investigation of his personal activities was hurting the
department's operations.
   Dennis succeeds William F. Weld, who resigned with Burns. Weld
testified in July to Congress that he felt Meese had probably
violated the federal gratuity law because he had accepted a number
of items of value from longtime friend E. Robert Wallach and had
performed official acts on Wallach's behalf.
   Meese wasn't indicted, but independent counsel James McKay
concluded the attorney general had probably twice broken a federal
conflict-of-interest law as well as tax laws.
   Keating, a former assistant Treasury Department secretary,
replaces Stephen S. Trott, who left the Justice Department earlier
this year to become a federal appeals court judge.
   Christensen, who is a lawyer from Salt Lake City; Keating and
Dennis, who is a former U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, all have
been filling their positions on an acting basis for several months.

   Police and sheriff's deputies searched
woods and marshes and manned roadblocks Tuesday, looking for a
gunman in camouflage clothing and a punk haircut who fired into a
school playground, wounding a 9-year-old girl.
   Sheriff Noel Griffin Jr. said officials knew who the gunman was
but that they had ``no idea why he did the shooting.'' The sheriff
would not reveal the suspect's identity but said he was not a local
resident.
   He would not say how the suspect had been identified.
   The thin, bearded man, with dirty blond hair shaved at the sides
and sticking up in the middle, hid behind bushes near Mascotte
Elementary School on Monday morning and fired a .22-caliber rifle
three times into a group of about 25 children in the playground.
   Third-grader Leah Wilbanks was shot through the upper right arm
and chest by a single bullet. The youngster, described as ``brave
and tough,'' was reported in good spirits Tuesday in the pediatric
intensive care unit at Orlando Regional Medical Center.
   Her condition was listed as serious, but no surgery was
necessary and ``she is responding well to treatment,'' said
hospital spokesman Joe Brown.
   Leah's grandmother, Dolly Chapman, said the youngster asked her
late Monday, ``Why would somebody shoot me?''
   Lawmen were stationed Tuesday at all elementary schools in the
rural area around this central Florida community of 1,600.
   Lake County School Superintendent Freddie Garner said children
in Mascotte and the surrounding towns of Groveland, Minneola and
Clermont would not be allowed on playgrounds for a few days. Doors
to all schools were locked, and all the county's principals were
instructed to take extra precautions.
   Mascotte Elementary reported more than 150 children absent
Tuesday. Normal absenteeism is about 20.
   Parents and teachers were advised to take special counsel with
the 25 children who saw their schoolmate get shot. Some of the
youngsters ran into the main school building, scared and crying,
after the shooting, said one teacher, Jack Currie.
   ``Generally the children were holding together. I was proud of
them,'' he said, adding that he did not believe the students will
suffer long-term trauma.
   Scores of officers and area residents who had joined in the
manhunt Monday afternoon and night left the search Tuesday to about
15 deputies and officers from the Mascotte Police Department.
   The sheriff discouraged civilians from coming back out.
   ``They should watch their kids . . . and leave it to us,'' he
said. ``We have a good suspect. They might get the wrong man.''
   Some of the angry residents, including fathers with children at
the school, had spent Monday afternoon and into the night in heavy
rains searching the woods and citrus groves, using pickup trucks
equipped with CB radios. Some carried arms or had weapons in their
vehicles.
   Mascotte Police Chief Don Page directed a crew of men chopping
down weeds and brush around a small pond near the school Tuesday in
search of the weapon used in the shooting.
   ``It could be that the weapon is in there,'' said Page.

<HEAD>Fired White Officer Wins $450,000 From Black City Council</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white policeman who said his firing
by Riviera Beach's black-dominated government was racially
motivated has won a $450,000 settlement.
   The City Council agreed Monday night to settle a lawsuit filed
by Steven J. Langevin, who was dismissed in 1983.
   Langevin, who is white, claimed the city used him as a scapegoat
after complaints about a June 1983 traffic stop involving the son
of an influential city official. The complainants, city manager,
police chief and all five members of the council were black.
   A Palm Beach County Circuit Court jury agreed in 1986 with
Langevin's claim and awarded him $540,000. An appellate court last
year upheld the decision, but the state Supreme Court said last
week it would hear the city's appeal.
   That encouraged Langevin's attorney to negotiate the settlement,
City Attorney Thomas Palmer said. At Palmer's urging, the council
unanimously approved the settlement.
   ``It was all something that happened long ago,'' Councilman
James Goode said. ``The question now is to settle it in the
cheapest way.''
   Palmer said the council should approve the settlement because if
the city lost the appeal, it might have to pay more than $1 million.
   Langevin and other officers stopped a car driven by Derrick
McCray, son of an influential city official and civil rights
activist, while searching for a robbery suspect.
   Then-City Manager William Wilkins fired Langevin on July 13,
1983. He was rehired briefly, because the case had not been
referred to a police review board, and was fired again Aug. 27.
   Wilkins, citing several incidents besides the traffic stop, said
he dismissed Langevin because of actions that ``contributed to the
tarnishing of the professional image'' of the department.
   Langevin did not seek reinstatement to the force.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 Yugoslav workers
demanding the resignation of the government demonstrated Tuesday in
front of the Parliament and tried to force their way inside.
   Protesters chanted ``We are going in!'' but hundreds of police
stationed in front of the building stopped them from entering.
   The protesters marched about 10 miles from an industrial
Belgrade suburb to the legislature to protest low wages and falling
living standards.
   Demonstrators booed and jeered Deputy Premier Milos
Milosavljevic and Parliament President Dusan Popovski when they
tried to address the crowd. The workers dispersed peacefully after
four hours following an address by Serbia's Communist Party chief,
Slobodan Milosevic.
   ``Your demands are the demands of the entire Yugoslav working
class,'' said Milosevic, who promised that personnel changes would
be demanded at an Oct. 17 Central Committee session. ``You can be
sure that we will not betray you.''
   Workers of several enterprises, including an engine and tractor
factory at Rakovica, six miles south of Belgrade, put down their
tools and staged the march, demanding a 100 percent wage increase.
   According to a statement read by one of their leaders,
demonstrators also demanded ``an urgent session of the Parliament,
which should unseat the government of Premier Branko Mikulic.''
   Yugoslavia has been faced with increasing social and labor
unrest in the face of the worst economic crisis in the country's
post-war history. Inflation is running at 217 percent, and the
foreign debt is $21 billion.
   The labor unrest has worsened since May, when government
austerity measures imposed hefty wage cuts and allowed substantial
price increases.
   According to figures published by the state Tanjug news agency
Tuesday, salaries in Yugoslavia have dropped by 24 percent this
year and living standards of Yugoslavs have plunged to the level of
mid-1960s. The Rakovica workers earn about $100 a month.
   Before being interrupted, Milosavljevic only managed to say ``I
understand the grievances of the workers,'' and that the government
was willing to resign if parliament decides accordingly.
   ``You don't understand anything ... how much is your salary?''
the crowd yelled back at him.
   Officials claim there is no alternative to the market-oriented
program worked out together with the International Monetary Fund if
the country wants to lower inflation and revive its faltering
economy.
   Adoption of the program was a condition set by the IMF and other
creditors for rescheduling Yugoslavia's foreign debt and obtaining
new credits.
   However, the government is negotiating with the IMF on ways to
amend the program by allowing wage increases for profitable
companies.
   The demonstrators calmed down after Milosevic urged them to
return to work. They agreed, chanting ``We Believe You, Slobodan!''
and ``Workers Are With You!''

   Eighty-one percent of American women like to
cook, but 56 percent don't like cooking every day, according to a
survey released Tuesday.
   Eighty-four percent accept cooking as one of their
responsibilities, according to the survey done for Vogue, Glamour,
Mademoiselle, Self and Bride's magazines. But three-quarters of the
respondents want to get the task done as quickly as possible.
   Eighty percent also do the food shopping alone _ whether or not
they are employed outside the home, it said.
   The study also divided American women into four groups, with
significantly different attitudes toward food, shopping and cooking.
   _Traditional homemakers, who make up 31 percent of all women,
believe it's the husband's job to support the family.
   _Displaced homemakers, 26 percent of all women, have
unfulfilling jobs out of financial necessity, or because of divorce
or separation, but would rather be a full-time homemaker.
   _Committed careerists, 33 percent, who ``see marriage and
child-rearing as an interruption of their careers.''
   _Free spirits, 11 percent, who don't fit any of the other
categories. Most reside in large, urban areas, are relatively
young, employed, and divorced or separated. Many are minorities.
They have the shopping habits of traditional homemakers but cook
like committed careerists.
   Mark Clements Research Inc., and National Family Opinion Inc.,
conducted the study for Conde Nast Publications. It mailed 2,500
questionnaires on Dec. 4 and got back 1,825 by Jan. 12 from women
18 to 65 years old. The sampling error was plus or minus 2.4
percent.

   The government Tuesday warned that
political demonstrations could hinder talks between authorities and
labor leaders demanding the legalization of Solidarity.
   About 1,000 students and university employees rallied at Warsaw
University in support of legalization of the banned trade union
federation and of the Independent Association of Students.
   The students raised the Solidarity banner on the main gate of
the university and chanted ``Solidarity!''
   University employees and faculty members also demanded pay
raises of 60 percent to compensate for inflation and complained
about poor teaching facilities.
   In his weekly news conference, government spokesman Jerzy Urban
said demonstrations and announcements of new Solidarity chapters
run counter to building ``a climate of reason, realism and mutual
trust.''
   ``Organizers of such events (demonstrations) should ask the
question: Do they make the process of agreement easier or more
difficult? If they bother to think, they should conclude they make
it more difficult and will play a role of blockers,'' Urban said.
   Authorities agreed to hold talks with labor representatives on
the future of Solidarity after a wave of strikes ended Sept. 3.
Urban said progress had been made in preparing for the talks, which
mediator Andrzej Stelmachowski said will probably begin Oct. 17.
   Solidarity, led by Lech Walesa, was crushed by security forces
in 1981 and outlawed in 1982.
   The demonstration took place on the university grounds in front
of the library, where university rector Grzegorz Bialkowski told
the demonstrators: ``I am here together with you not only because I
thought employees have the right to gather legally and express
their opinion about their problems, but also to prove to you I want
to be together with the university community,''
   The protesters dispersed peacefully after about an hour.

   A boat ferrying people from a flooded
village in eastern Pakistan capsized Tuesday and 40 people were
believed dead, police said.
   Rescuers recovered the bodies of 15 people who came from
Kalakhatei village, about 18 miles northeast of Lahore.
   A week of flooding in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province has
claimed the lives of 36 people, excluding Tuesday's victims,
according to official figures. But officials with a variety of
relief agencies said the casualty figure is closer to 200.
   Heavy rains in the mountainous Kashmir and Jammu areas triggered
the flooding. Rivers flowing from these mountains are beginning to
recede, local authorities said, but the Sutlej river is threatening
villages in the southern part of Punjab. The area hardest-hit by
the waters is the southern city of Bahawalpur.
   Government agencies said about 3,000 villages have been affected
by the flooding and almost 2 million people stranded.
   Health officials in villages near Lahore fear that lack of
sanitary conditions may result in an outbreak of cholera and
typhoid. The officials said thousands of people have been
vaccinated against the diseases.
   The army has delivered food packages to stranded flood victims
and the government has allocated $3 million toward aid for flood
victims.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci honored 13
civilian Defense Department employees Tuesday with Outstanding
Handicapped Employee of the Year awards, saying they had made
``invaluable contributions to national security.''
   ``I am proud of DOD's posture as a leader among federal agencies
regarding the employment and advancement of handicapped
individuals,'' Carlucci added.
   The 13 honorees, employed at a variety of installations across
the country, included men and women who have overcome such
handicaps as blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy and spinal cord
injuries.
   One of this year's winners, Kathryn Elizabeth Porter of
Waynesboro, Pa., now is a clerk-typist with the Defense
Investigative Service in Washington and ``overcame a hearing
impairment, mild cerebral palsy, double sclerosis and a congenital
hip malfunction,'' the Pentagon said.
   Another honoree, Shannon M. Keenan, ``was born with a severe
hearing loss and with cerebral palsy.''
   ``She conquered both and today is a military pay examiner with
the Department of Military Affairs, Minnesota National Guard in St.
Paul, Minn.,'' the department said.
   Other honorees included Francis J. Boyle of the Defense

   Two tractor-trailer rigs collided Tuesday,
igniting a tanker truck fire that spewed poisonous smoke and forced
the evacuation of about 500 people, state police said.
   The fire burned itself out six hours later and residents in this
southwest Louisiana town were allowed to return home.
   Five people who were in the two trucks were reported injured,
and four were admitted to a hospital, said Ronnie Jones, a state
police spokesman. The victims' identities and conditions were not
immediately available, he said.
   He said police did not know how the accident happened because
they had not been able to interview the injured.
   The tanker truck was carrying 4,600 gallons of toluene, an
industrial solvent, and naptha, a cleaning solution, Trooper Paul
Wood said. Both chemicals are toxic and flammable, he said.
   The second truck was carrying steel or concrete netting, Jones
said.
   The tanker fire burned itself out on the Mermentau River Bridge
six hours after the 6 a.m. accident on Interstate 10, about one
mile east of Jennings, Jones said. Jennings is about 100 miles west
of Baton Rouge.
   ``The product burned much like a wick would do in a lamp of oil,
burning on top and consuming the product,'' he said.
   More than 500 people who evacuated a three-mile area were
allowed to return home after noon, Jones said.
   ``They were evacuated out of an abundance of caution,'' said
Wood.
   The westbound lanes of I-10 were opened after noon. But the
eastbound lanes were to remain closed until the bridge could be
cleaned and inspected by the state Department of Transportation and
Development, Jones said.
   Jones said the bridge did not appear to sustain serious damage.
   ``It did not appear to us that any of the product was burning on
the bridge itself,'' Jones said. ``It remained in the tank while it
burned.''

<HEAD>Interior Agents' Destruction of Marijuana Plants Leaps During
Summer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department on Tuesday said its
agents had destroyed 51 percent more marijuana plants this summer
than they did in all of 1987.
   A department announcement said law enforcement officers were not
sure whether the increase ``meant that drug activity actually is
increasing on federal lands or whether it merely reflects the
department's intensified enforcement efforts.''
   The department is in charge of the national parks, battlefields,
monuments, seashores and recreation areas; Indian reservations;
wildlife refuges and other public land, mostly in the West.
   The statistics do not include the national forests of the
Agriculture Department's Forest Service. All spokesmen for law
enforcement officers of the Forest Service were out of town, their
office said.
   Interior agencies seized and destroyed 166,000 marijuana plants
from mid-June to mid-September this year compared with 110,000
plants in all of last year, the department said.
   Department officers eradicated plants at 432 sites this summer,
a number spokesman Alan Levitt said represented a substantial
increase over activity in 1987 though he did not have a comparable
department-wide figure for the previous year.
   By way of example, he said, the Bureau of Land Management dealt
with 234 sites this summer vs. 232 in all of 1987.
   The statement quoted Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel as
saying he was ``delighted by the Interior Department's contribution
to the anti-drug campaign.''
   Hodel said visitors deserve credit for increased detection and
were directly responsible for many cases, including the largest
one, the destruction of 20,000 plants just outside the boundary of
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in August.
   Agents are finding ``fewer large open fields, but many smaller,
well-concealed plots consisting of a few dozen to several hundred
plants,'' often hidden under a forest canopy to avoid detection
from the air or camouflaged with netting, Hodel said.
   For the first time, Interior agents are using the LANDSAT IV
satellite to locate ``high potential areas'' for enforcement, the
department said.
   The agents report that growers seemed to be suffering from the
drought just like legitimate farmers.
   One site in Yosemite National Park in California yielded 1,500
feet of polyvinyl chloride tubing that was feeding water from a
makeshift dam to five separate plots.

   American Samoa's former delegate to Congress
drew a five-to-15-month prison term Tuesday for participating in a
payroll-padding scheme that prosecutors say earned him $39,000.
   Fofo I.F. Sunia, a Democrat who served almost four terms in the
House, was sentenced on his guilty plea to conspiring with his
chief aide, Matthew Iuli, to defraud the government of $130,920
through false payroll claims.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris rejected a defense contention
that Sunia passively accepted proceeds from a scheme started by
Iuli without his direct knowledge.
   ``It is inconceivable to me with your obvious abilities ... that
you weren't familiar with what was happening,'' the judge told
Sunia. ``What happened here is a very serious matter _ the padding
of a congressional payroll over an extended period of time.''
   Before he was sentenced, Sunia told the judge: ``I have come to
understand the meaning of shame (and) fear. I have made apologies
to my people and I hope they will forgive me.''
   Sunia, who said he was prepared to accept whatever punishment
the judge imposed, offered to teach in American Samoa as community
service in lieu of imprisonment.
   Sunia, 51, said he wanted to ``help continue to build a better
community and begin to atone for the wrong that I have done.''
   The former lawmaker, who could have received a five-year
sentence and a $250,000 fine, has agreed to pay restitution of
$65,000 under the terms of the plea bargain he made with
prosecutors.
   Under federal parole guidelines, Sunia would become eligible for
parole after serving five months.
   According to the charge to which both Sunia and Iuli pleaded
guilty on Aug. 3, 78 paychecks were issued between February 1983
and August 1986 to people falsely listed as members of Sunia's
staff.
   Prosecutors said Iuli, who received a three-month prison
sentence on Monday, used some of the proceeds to reimburse himself
for expenses he incurred working for Sunia.
   Other money was used to entertain constituents who expected
Sunia to pay for their hotel accomodations and meals while they
were visiting the nation's capital, according to prosecutors.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Andary said Sunia's case was
different because the former lawmaker ``did receive a very
substantial personal benefit from this scheme.''
   Andary said Sunia ``betrayed the trust that was put in him by
the people of American Samoa'' by approving the scheme and
pocketing some $39,000 from the ghost employee scheme.
   The money Sunia took helped him purchase a house, a car and pay
for air travel for his family to and from Samoa, Andary said.
   Defense attorney Earl J. Silbert urged Harris to take into
consideration Sunia's passive personality, which he contended
explained the defendant's failure to question the source of the
money he received from the scheme.
   Quoting from a letter written to the judge by a Samoan, Silbert
said: ``A high chief never questions where things come from.''
   But Andary said this explanation was ``a way to avoid
responsibility by way of putting the full blame on Mr. Iuli.''
Sunia ``is consciously trying to avoid his own involvement in the
offense.''
   Sunia resigned his seat in Congress on Sept. 6, the day before
the House ethics committee was to hold a disciplinary hearing on
his case. As a delegate, he was allowed to vote in legislative
committees but not on the House floor.

   The State Department said Tuesday it had
received and welcomed assurances from Chile that the outcome of a
plebiscite on President Augusto Pinchoet will be ``respected.''
   ``We are, of course, very hopeful,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said. ``We will continue to closely monitor events in Chile.''
   The voting on Wednesday is on whether to accept or reject the
general's bid for another eight years in the presidency. If he
fails to get a majority, Pinochet is supposed to call free
elections at the end of next year.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met last week in New York
with Chilean Foreign Minister Ricardo Garcia and underscored the
United States favored a free and fair election.
   Other U.S. officials have made similar statements.
   Mrs. Oakley, at the State Department's daily briefing Tuesday,
said an ``official commitment'' had been provided by the Chilean
embassy in Washington and the Ministry of Interior in Santiago
``that the plebiscite will be carried out as scheduled and that its
result will be respected.''
   But she said ``concerns'' expressed by her Monday about the
circumstances surrounding the voting were based on ``sound
information.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Harry G. Barnes Jr., who will end his
assignment in November, told The New York Times in an interview in
Santiago that he would leave happier if Pinochet were defeated in
the plebiscite.
   ``I look forward to coming back in March 1990, when the first
democratically elected president would be inaugurated, if the `No'
wins, rather than having to wait until 1997,'' the 62-year-old
ambassador was quoted as saying.
   Barnes, who was an also-ran last year in the selection of a new
U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, is nearing the end of a
38-year diplomatic career.
   ``At this point,'' he said, ``I think the `No' will win if the
process doesn't get interrupted. That opens the way to free
elections. Our whole approach has been to promote a rapid return to
democracy, so it would be a nice way to leave, knowing that step
had been taken.''
   The Times said Barnes was credited with helping to make
possible, through continued U.S. pressure, a relatively free
campaign environment and reasonable assurance of an honest
proceeding on Wednesday.
   Mrs. Oakley, asked about the interview, said ``I simply am not
aware of those remarks,''
   She also reiterated that ``what we have said all along is that
we are in favor of a process, of a plebiscite, of a free expression
of the Chilean people. We have never expressed in any way our
opinion on what that vote ought to be. That remains clearly our
position.''

<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco withdrew a
peace proposal to leftist guerrillas because of a wave of rebel
attacks, a Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
   ``It is incomprehensible that the answer by subversive groups to
a generous peace proposal would be so violent and criminal,'' the
minister of government, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, said in a broadcast
interview.
   Trujillo is in charge of internal security in Colombia.
   Last month, the president offered a cease-fire, negotiations,
pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebel
leaders to speak before congress.
   All six of Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups rejected the plan.
   Gaviria was particularly critical of the country's largest
guerrilla group, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, known by
its Spanish acronym as the FARC.
   FARC attacks killed 12 soldiers, six policemen and three
civilians on Sunday and Monday, the Defense Ministry said.
   ``The government authorizes full institutional support for the
armed forces to confront the guerrillas, because weakness or
complacency doesn't result in peace,'' Gaviria said in an interview
with the Bogota radio station Caracol.
   Justice Minister Guillermo Plazas said the guerrillas' answer to
``the olive branch offered by President Barco has been attacks on
the army, blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs.''
   The FARC has used a cease-fire during the last four years ``to
cheat the government'' by increasing its strength, Plazas said in a
broadcast interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.
   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting the government since 1960.
   The FARC signed a truce with the government of former President
Belisario Betancur four years ago. There has been sporadic fighting
between the FARC and government security forces during the truce.
   Another guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, has blown
up the country's main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years.
   On Saturday, the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline, which
carries 225,000 barrels of oil a day from the Canon Limon field in
the northeast state of Arauca.
   On Sept. 28, the National Liberation Army set off a bomb in
Bogota as the car of a Texaco executive passed by. The executive,
John Buttle, a Canadian, was not injured.
   In July, the National Liberation Army kidnapped the owner of
General Pipe Co., of Houston, Jake Gambini. There has been no word
on Gambini's fate.

<HEAD>Convicted Rapist Seeks Pardon Based On New Scientific Evidence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted rapist Gary Dotson should be pardoned
because new scientific evidence proves he was imprisoned ``for a
crime that never happened,'' his lawyer said Tuesday.
   In 1985, his accuser, now a New Hampshire housewife, said she
lied in 1977 when she said Dotson raped her.
   New high-technology DNA tests of blood and semen have
``concluded positively that Mr. Dotson is eliminated, excluded from
the forensic sample found in Cathleen Crowell Webb's panties,'' his
attorney, Thomas Breen, told the Illinois Prisoner Review Board
during a clemency hearing.
   But the Cook County state's attorney's office said a pardon
should not be granted because the tests were not reliable and would
not be admissible in Illinois courts.
   ``It is important that Dotson not be given the extraordinary
measure of pardon without more information on this new scientific
technology,'' said Assistant State's Attorney Gayle Shines.
   Paul Klincar, chairman of the Prisoner Review Board, said the
panel would make a recommendation to Gov. James Thompson in two to
three weeks and the governor would make the final decision.
   The governor commuted Dotson's 25- to 50-year rape sentence in
1985 to time served but rejected a request for clemency, saying he
did not believe Mrs. Webb's recantation.
   Dotson was released from prison in August after serving six
months for a parole violation and is enrolled in a residential
alcohol rehabilitation program. He was not at the hearing Tuesday.
   But his attorney said the new tests prove ``Mr. Dotson was in
fact arrested, convicted and sentenced for a crime that never
happened.''
   Dotson was convicted of rape in 1979. He had served six years
when Mrs. Webb came forward and said she had made up the story
while a suburban teen-ager to conceal a sexual encounter she had
had with her boyfriend.
   Genetic tests conducted by Dr. Edward Blake, a California
forensic expert, on Dotson's sperm and blood and semen on Mrs.
Webb's underwear showed the semen could have come from 5 percent of
the male population, but not from Dotson, Breen said.
   Blake's tests were different than DNA examinations performed on
the underwear earlier this year in England, Breen said. The British
tests were inconclusive because the 11-year-old sample was too old
to yield results.
   Mark Stolorow, director of research and development for the
Illinois State Police Division of Forensic Services and
Identification, said he agreed with Blake's findings.
   But Shines argued that Dotson might not have left semen in the
underwear.
   ``If the board determines that Dotson was not the donor of the
semen, that does not mean that Mrs. Webb was not raped,'' she said.
``Just as you don't need fingerprints to prove a robbery occurred,
you don't need semen to prove a rape occurred.''
   Breen rejected the idea, saying prosecutors had never before
suggested the theory.
   Since Dotson was first released from prison he has had several
scrapes with the law. He was jailed in 1987 for violating parole
and being convicted of drunken driving.
   On Christmas Eve, Thompson freed Dotson again in what the
governor called a ``last-chance deal.''
   Two days later, Dotson was arrested in a bar fight and in
February, the prison review board ordered him to serve six months
for a second parole violation.

<HEAD>Blackmun Rejects Request to Block Possible Rail Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice on Tuesday rejected an
emergency request by the Burlington Northern Railroad Co. designed
to block a possible strike against its 29,000-mile system.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun refused to reinstate an anti-strike
injunction that was lifted on Sept. 30 by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals based in St. Louis.
   Burlington Northern said the appeals court order could mean
strike activities will be resumed against the railroad pending
further court appeals in a dispute between the railroad and the
United Transportation Union.
   The dispute was triggered by Burlington Northern's plan to sell
a section of its line in Montana and Idaho to the Montana Rail
Link, a new corporation.
   This type of transaction recently was exempted from review by
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   The union threatened to strike after failing to block the sale
or get the railroad to negotiate over the planned sale.
   The 8th Circuit court last May refused to enjoin the union from
striking, but that ruling did not take effect until Sept. 30.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson and her
co-defendants in a divorce-fixing conspiracy trial ``decided they
could buy and sell justice,'' a federal prosecutor claimed Tuesday.
   ``This is a case about money, greed and abuse of power,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lawrence told the jury in his opening
statement.
   Miss Myerson, 64, Miss America 1945, was the city's cultural
affairs commissioner before the scandal _ known locally as the
``Bess Mess'' _ forced her resignation.
   Describing Miss Myerson as ``one of the celebrities of New
York,'' Lawrence told the jurors: ``This case is about whether such
privileged people are above the law.''
   Also on trial are Miss Myerson's boyfriend, Carl ``Andy''
Capasso, 43, and former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel,
75, who presided over part of Capasso's bitter divorce from his
wife Nancy.
   The three face five counts each of conspiracy, mail fraud and
bribe-related charges for an alleged scheme to slash Capasso's
weekly child support and alimony payments.
   Miss Myerson is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to
Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet, who was then 34, to get the judge
to reduce Capasso's temporary support payments to his wife.
   Miss Myerson also is charged with obstructing justice for
allegedly trying to keep Sukhreet Gabel from testifying truthfully
before a federal grand jury.
   Capasso's attorney insisted in his opening that the case was
unjustified, stemming from a scorned wife's allegations.
   ``There was no fury as intense and mean-spirited as that of
Nancy Capasso,'' lawyer Jay Goldberg told the jury.
   Miss Myerson was named a co-respondent in the Capasso divorce.
   ``They are not on trial because of their affair,'' said
Lawrence. ``They are not on trial because of Mr. Capasso's divorce.
They are on trial because of the use of a city position, of the
city payroll, to pay for a bribe.''
   Ms. Gabel, who has been described in court papers as emotionally
fragile, will testify for the government, said Lawrence.
   ``At times, ladies and gentlemen, Sukhreet Gabel may not be a
pretty picture. In fact, some of the things she has to say will
shock you,'' said Lawrence, without elaborating.
   He said Ms. Gabel initially refused to cooperate with
prosecutors but eventually agreed to testify ``even if that meant
her testimony might be damaging to her mother.''
   Lawrence described Capasso and Miss Myerson as ``a millionaire
sewer contractor and his mistress who readily shared his wealth.''
Once a leading city sewer and water contractor, Capasso is serving
a three-year prison term for an unrelated tax conviction.
   Mrs. Gabel, he said, ``sold the courthouse,'' not for money but
out of ``concern that she had for her 34-year-old daughter, her
only child.''
   ``Myerson and Capasso's obsession with the divorce coincided
with Judge Gabel's obsession for finding employment for her
daughter,'' said the prosecutor.
   If convicted of all charges, Miss Myerson would face a maximum
penalty of 30 years in prison and $513,000 in fines. Capasso and
Mrs. Gabel would face up to 25 years in prison and $263,000 in
fines.

<HEAD>South Carolina Nuclear Plant Accidents Unreported For 28 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious mishaps over 28 years at a government
plant in South Carolina that produces materials for nuclear weapons
were kept secret for national security reasons and not reported to
Washington, federal officials said Tuesday.
   But the situation is changing, in part due to pressure from
Congress, they said.
   One senior Energy Department official has compared the attitude
toward safety at the Savannah River facility near Aiken, S.C., to
that which led to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan.
28, 1986.
   ``There has always been a mind set, a culture, that we are doing
work that is important for national security and perhaps that may
override any obligation toward public accountablility,'' Will
Callicott, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said Tuesday.
   Since taking office in 1985, said Callicott, Energy Secretary
John Herrington ``has given heightened attention to the area of
environmental safety and health,'' for the first time placing these
issues in the hands of an assistant secretary.
   E.I. du Pont Nemours & Co. runs the Savannah River facility
under contract for the energy department. The plant, which has five
reactors, produces plutonium and tritium, which are used in making
nuclear weapons.
   According to a 1985 memorandum, 30 ``reactor incidents of the
greatest significance'' occurred there and were not disclosed to
the public.
   One of the most serious was the melting in November 1970 of a
rod used to start an atomic chain reaction, causing radioactive
contamination of an adjacent room. It took 900 people three months
to clean up the contamination, according to the memo, which does
not specify whether radioactivity escaped from the facility.
   Energy Department officials said on Friday that they had not
been informed of the incidents, but on Monday senior department
spokesman C. Anson Franklin said those statements were incorrect
and that the incidents had been reported to the department's
regional office in Aiken.
   He said that the information apparently had not been relayed to
headquarters from the regional office.
   The reactors at Savannah River were closed after the most recent
incident, in August, and had been scheduled to reopen on Tuesday.
But Energy Department officials assured members of Congress last
week that production would not resume until safety was assured,
possibly after 30 to 45 days.
   ``If they restart those things without having briefed us and
without having convinced us they have solved the safety and health
issues, they will be in serious trouble in the Congress,'' said
Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla..
   Synar, chairman of the Energy, Environment and Natural Resources
subcommittee of the Government Affairs Committee, held hearings on
the Savannah River facility last Friday.
   He reacted angrily Tuesday to assertions that national security
considerations ever justified keeping mishaps secret at Savannah
River.
   ``Just because they claim it is national security doesn't make
it national security,'' he said. ``I didn't know that the health
and safety of the workers and the surrounding citizens was a
national security issue.''
   Synar challenged assertions that Herrington had improved the
Energy Department's system.
   ``They have set up a system that rewards managers in the field
for keeping the lid on bad news,'' said Synar.
   ``I think that there are good people at the Energy Department
that want to make safety a priority,'' he said. ``That attitude
starts at the top. And I haven't seen it. It is very clear that
headquarters has not been supportive of that. There has not been a
system set up that made the operational or field offices
accountable.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, also held hearings on problems at Savannah River
last week and sharply criticized the Energy Department and du Pont.
   Officials at the Energy Department, which builds nuclear weapons
for the Pentagon, said that the penchant for secrecy began in the
days of the Manhattan Project, the program to develop atomic
weapons during World War II.
   Although the attitude has changed at the top, the message has
not percolated down, said the officials.
   Discussing the power pulse at Savannah River in August, Richard
Starostecki, deputy assistant secretary for safety, health and
quality assurance, wrote that ``the issue was not whether the
reactor was out of control; this time it was not.''
   ``The more serious issue deals with an institutional problem and
attitudes toward safety,'' Starostecki said in a Sept. 16 memo that
was released at the House panel's hearing on Friday.
   ``There are currently some managers within the department with
an attitude toward production reactor safety, which on the face
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program
prior to the Challenger accident,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels staged
simultaneous attacks on army positions in four eastern towns, and
one soldier and three guerrillas were killed, the military said
Tuesday.
   Col. Inocente Orlando Montano, commander of the 6th Infantry
Brigade in the city of Usulutan, said 75 guerrillas accompanied by
about 150 unarmed civilian supporters attacked army posts on the
edge of the city Monday night.
   One soldier and two guerrillas were killed, a gasoline station
was destroyed and several homes were damaged, he said by telephone.
   Usulutan, a provincial capital, is 68 miles east of San Salvador.
   About the same time, the rebels attacked an army post in
Chinameca, 75 miles east of San Salvador in San Miguel province,
military sources there said. One guerrilla was killed, they said.
   Rebels also carried out attacks in two other Usulutan cities,
Jucuapa and Jiquilisco, but no deaths or injuries were reported,
Montano said.
   They destroyed a number of electrical installations in the
province, cutting service, he said.
   On the outskirts of San Salvador, guerrillas destroyed four
electricity poles but no major outages were reported.
   The leftist rebels frequently attack the electrical system to
cause disruptions and force the U.S.-backed government to spend
money on repairs.
   About 65,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have been
killed in the nearly 9-year-old war.

   About $1.2 billion in cash payments soon will
be made to farmers under the Conservation Reserve Program, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the payments are rental fees for land
contracts signed in the 1986, 1987 and 1988 fiscal years.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take highly erodible
cropland from production for 10 years. In return, USDA helps pay
for planting the land to protective grass or trees and provides
annual rental payments over the 10-year contract period.
   The goal under the program is to take 40 million to 45 million
acres of highly erodible land from crop production by 1990. More
than 25.5 million acres have have been officially enrolled, and an
additional 3.4 million acres were offered by farmers in a recent
signup.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of Rep. Robert K. Dornan
has taken an AIDS test and received a clean bill of health,
disproving a statement by his sister that he was dying of AIDS, the
Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.
   ``I had a feeling I was strong and healthy,'' said Douglas
Richard Hansen, 51, a landscape architect from San Diego, who said
he hasn't spoken to his sister for several years.
   Hansen, who had maintained since his name was first brought up
that he did not have the deadly disease, offered to take an AIDS
test to end the controversy. The test, arranged by the newspaper's
medical department, indicated no sign of the infection by the AIDS
virus.
   During a contentious town hall meeting with homosexual leaders
in Garden Grove last month, Hansen's sister, Sallie Dornan, yelled,
``Shut up, fag'' to a gay rights activist.
   Later, Mrs. Dornan emotionally apologized and said the remark
came out of anger over the fact that one of her four brothers was
dying of AIDS.
   A relative who saw the news reports called Hansen to tell him
about the meeting.
   Neither Dornan, a Republican, nor his wife would comment Monday
on the test results. Mrs. Dornan is campaign manager for her
husband's re-election bid in the 38th Congressional District.
   Dornan's chief of staff, Brian Bennett, said of the results:
``We're very glad of that, then. That's excellent.''
   He added: ``This has absolutely nothing to do with Congressman
Bob Dornan. This is between his wife and her brother.''
   Hansen said he has forgiven his sister for the remarks she made
about him at the meeting. He had said earlier he had not heard from
his sister in several years and had not gotten along with her
husband since a dispute the two had more than 30 years ago.
   ``I know she's a good woman,'' Hansen said of his sister. ``I'll
love her till I die. And when and if that turkey husband of hers
tumbles off his little pedestal, I'll be there to catch my sister.
But he can keep falling.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Tuesday signed emergency
congressional legislation that extends by six months a federal
program providing costly medicine for indigent victims of AIDS.
   The White House said in a brief statement that Reagan had
approved the bill which authorizes appropriations of $15 million to
continue supplies of the drug AZT to such victims through next
March 31. The program would have expired at midnight last Friday,
but the House passed the Senate bill and sent it to the White House.
   The legislation avoids an interruption in the federal program
providing AZT to victims who cannot afford the treatment, which can
cost more than $600 a month. AZT is the only drug approved by the
Food and Drug Administration for use in combating AIDS.
   The bill doesn't provide money specifically for AZT, but
authorizes federal spending of $15 million for the next six months.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen has indicated he
would find money in existing programs until the next Congress can
act, and the only supplier of the drug, Burroughs Wellcome Co., has
said it would provide $5 million of the drug at no cost.
   A year ago, the average cost of AZT for an AIDS victim was $850
to $900 a month. The price dropped early this year to about $600 a
month.
   The drug, which is taken by 5,000 to 6,000 indigent AIDS
sufferers, is believed by some scientists to stop the AIDS virus
from multiplying inside a cell.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   As of Sept. 26, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 74,447
Americans, of whom more than half, or 41,925, have died since June
1, 1981, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly 65 Earth
orbits, Discovery's post-flight condition was as good or better
than any space shuttle, although debris gouged six heat-shield
tiles, apparently during liftoff, a NASA official said Tuesday.
   There were few ``dings'' to other tiles, and no damage to the
orbiter's brakes, landing gear or tires, John ``Tip'' Talone said.
   Discovery sat inside the 100-foot-tall ``mate-demate device,'' a
framework where it gets serviced for a piggyback jet ride home
Saturday to Florida.
   ``The crews are working, and they will work round the clock
until the orbiter leaves,'' said Ted Ayers, deputy site manager for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dryden Flight
Research Facility here.
   Discovery landed Monday on the hard clay bed of Rogers Dry Lake
at this Mojave Desert air base, capping a nearly flawless flight
that was America's first manned space mission since the Challenger
tragedy in 1986.
   ``The vehicle looks beautiful,'' Talone, the shuttle processing
director, said during a news conference. ``It looks probably as
good or better as any vehicle we've brought in here.''
   Six tiles near the right wing must be replaced because of a
12-inch-long, 6-inch-wide, 1{-inch-deep gouge apparently caused by
debris during the shuttle's launch last Thursday, Talone said. He
added that the tiles weren't missing, as Ayers said earlier.
   Talone said officials weren't yet sure if the debris was ice
that formed on the outside of the shuttle's external tank, which
contains supercold liquid fuel.
   ``There's a minor number of traditional dings'' on some other
tiles, caused by the impact of tiny particles during liftoff and
landing, he added.
   After preliminary inspection found no damage, the shuttle's
brakes were shipped to B.F. Goodrich in Ohio for a closer look, he
said. The brakes were improved because of brake and tire damage
during previous missions.
   Talone said NASA workers haven't identified the cause of the
trouble with Discovery's cooling system flash evaporators, a
problem that made the astronauts endure temperatures in the 80s
during their flight.
   NASA plans for Discovery to leave Edwards early Saturday,
arriving at Kennedy Space Center before dark following a single
stop near San Antonio, Texas, Talone said.
   The mate-demate device is a red-painted steel trusswork
structure, in which the 193,000-pound orbiter is serviced, then
hoisted 60 feet and placed atop a modified Boeing 747 jet that will
fly it back to Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   Tasks to prepare Discovery for the trip home include
deactivating fuel cells, photographing tile damage and replacing
the gouged tiles, purging main engines and orbital maneuvering
engines, and attaching locks to prevent control flaps from
fluttering during the piggyback flight.
   Discovery's next mission is scheduled to start Feb. 18, three
months after Atlantis' planned Nov. 17 liftoff with a classified
Defense Department payload. On its five-day February flight,
Discovery will deploy another communications satellite like the one
it placed in orbit last Thursday.

<TEXT>
   George Bush on Tuesday proposed
creation of a federally supported foundation to encourage America's
youth to volunteer their help for the less fortunate.
   ``I want our affluent to help our poor,'' the Republican
presidential candidate said in a speech unveiling his proposal for
a YES to America Foundation. ``I want the young men and women of
our tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or the subway, or the
metro, and go into the cities where the want is.''
   Bush blended his proposal with a dose of the liberal-bashing
rhetoric that marks his campaign for the White House. He predicted
that his critics would sneer that ``a national voluntary effort
just won't be as good as a new multi-billion dollar program.''
   Bush outlined his proposal for a Youth in Service to America
Foundation as he worked to cement support i northern California, a
region that advisers say is up for grabs in the White House
campaign.
   Bush dusted off his familiar attack style of campaigning later
in the day when he blasted ``the liberal governor of Masachusetts''
at a sun-drenched rally on the steps of the Riverside County
Courthouse in Southern California.
   He said Dukakis had criticized the three-year 25 percent income
tax cut enacted during the Reagan administration but promised,
``I'm not going to let them take that away from us.''
   He arranged a stop for later in the day in New Mexico.
   Bush's Sacramento speech marked an effort to flesh out his
campaign call for a ``kinder, gentler nation'' and also combat the
Democrats' portrayal of him as an uncaring member of the upper
class.
   He said some kids have ``$40 jeans and $50 sneakers'' while
others live ``lives of utter desolation in the poorest
neighborhoods.'' One group should help the other, he said,
expressing the hope that ``the work itself, the labor of love is
the reward.''
   Bush said that a quarter century of massive federal spending
programs has demonstrated that ``we can't buy our way out'' of the
problem.
   Bush said he would serve as chairman of his proposed a Youth in
Service to America Foundation.
   An aide to Bush, Deborah Steelman, said the vice president
envisioned a $100 million annual federal contribution for the
program. She said the foundation would set broad guidelines for
community activities but local leaders would have discretion in the
types of programs they set up. She said some activities could
involve payment.
   Bush said current volunteer programs that work well could be
expanded and others could be created. He suggested that some
participants would travel to the inner city ghettos to read to
children there.
   ``Some of the poor don't speak English and can't fill out forms
for their children to go to school. Some women need help and advice
on what to do about a repeatedly abusive husband. They don't know
that there are private organizations that can help,'' he said.
   ``Government, we must finally admit, isn't the answer,'' Bush
said. ``And it isn't enough to say, `I'm a Republican and life is
imperfect.'''
   He conceded he may have been confusing when he spoke in his
campaign debate of a ``thousand points of light,'' and used
Tuesday's speech to explain himself.
   ``In a national movement such as `Yes to America' I am saying
`Add your light to the sum of light,''' he said. ``Give to those
who cross your path and enter your life.''

   Police in Laos have captured two
Americans who said they planned to distribute dollar bills stamped
with a reward offer for any U.S. military personnel still held
captive in Indochina.
   Ross Petzing, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Donna Long of
Jacksonville, N.C., and another American were being held at Ban
Sing Samphan in the southern Laotian province of Champasak.
   Jerry Kiley of the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans identified the second American as Jim Copp of Hamstead,
N.C. Another committee member, John Nevin, said in Washington that
neither American had a visa to enter Laos.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters in
Washington that the U.S. Consulate in Udorn, Thailand, confirmed
that Lao authorities detained two Americans Monday on the Thai-Lao
border.
   ``The Americans had rented a boat and were on the Mekong River.
The Thai-Lao border does not run along the middle of the river but
evidently follows a varying line, and the Americans may have
accidentally floated into Lao territory,'' said Mrs. Oakley. ``We
are waiting for the Lao authorities to inform us whether the
Americans will be held and charged or released. Our counsel has not
yet met with them.''
   ``They looked so sad,'' said Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel
manager who crossed the Mekong River into Laos to see them Tuesday.
Ms. Pornthipa said she took the Americans clothing, food and
cigarettes but was not allowed to speak to them.
   Petzing said: ``We have advised our embassy in Vientiane of the
arrest and our embassy is checking with Lao authorities to
determine what has transpired.''
   On Sunday, Ms. Long told The Associated Press she and Copp
planned to drop plastic bags containing stamped dollars and other
currency into the river and pass out money in villages along
Laotian bank of the Mekong. She revealed the plan on condition it
not be revealed until the two left Laos or were captured.
   Each bill bears a message offering a $2.4 million reward to
anyone delivering an American prisoner of war to the International
Red Cross.
   Ms. Pornthipa said the Americans were held in a small house in
Ban Sing Samphan. She said Laotian authorities told her Monday they
would be freed within three days.
   She said the management of her hotel in Ubon felt some
responsibility because the Americans made contact with it before
starting the trip to the Mekong, which forms a boundary with
Thailand and flows to both Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The reward is being offered to Cambodians, Laotians and
Vietnamese through the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans, a private group. The committee says the money was pledged
by 21 congressmen and the American Defense Institute, another group
concerned with missing soldiers.
   The United States lists 2,393 Americans as still missing in
action in the Indochina war, which ended in 1975. The governments
of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia say no Americans are held in their
countries.
   Kiley, project director for American War Veterans, claimed 600
Americans are missing in Laos.
   ``The reason why these two peoples as private citizens are
jeopardizing themselves is because the United States government has
never acknowledged the existence of those POWs in Laos,'' he said
in a telephone interview in New York.
   Several activists, including relatives of MIAs, floated balloons
down the Mekong from the Thai shore last year with offers of the
reward, with no known result.
   Ms. Long said Sunday that she and Copp planned to travel from
Ubon to Khong Chaim on the banks of the Mekong, then north along
the river to a Thai fishing village where they could hire a boat to
take them across to the Laotian shore.
   Petzing said the two were seized across from the Khong Chiam
district in an area where the Mun River flows into the Mekong.
   Ms. Long described herself as a ``POW-MIA activist'' whose late
husband served three combat tours in Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   Graduates of a police academy that is under
fire for a recent rash of cadet illnesses met Tuesday to defend the
institution against accusations of abusive physical training.
   ``The training is necessarily tough,'' said a spokeswoman for
the group, Amherst Patrolman Colleen Griswold. ``It brings out your
inner strength. ... It does not turn you into a Gestapo henchman.''
   Griswold read from a statement while 28 other graduates from a
half-dozen classes stood behind her on the steps of the Agawam
academy.
   At least 16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and
exhaustion after one trainee collapsed on the first day of
training, Sept. 19. The academy was closed on the third day of
training and classes were moved to a National Guard Armory because
of suspicions surrounding the drinking water.
   The water has been declared untainted by state environmental
officials and attention has turned toward the degree of physical
exertion demanded of the cadets.
   One of the cadets, Timothy Shepard of Pittsfield, remained in a
coma at a Pittsburgh hospital Tuesday, 15 days after his collapse
and a week after a liver transplant, although his sister-in-law
said he appeared to turn his head and recognize his mother and
pregnant wife.
   ``He may be starting to come out of the coma,'' said Becky
Shepard.
   The former cadets said they were mystified by the maladies that
hit a third of a class of 50 cadets under the leadership of one
state trooper who had formerly served as second-in-command and an
assistant who had previously taught water safety at the academy.
   The commandant, John M. Richardson, and his assistant, Charles
Blake Gilmore, were reassigned Tuesday at their request.
   Griswold called Gilmore as ``a qualified, sensitive individual.
... I am terrified of water and he made me feel comfortable in it.''
   She also had no complaints about Richardson from her 14-week
class, which ended in January. She was the only woman to graduate
from her class, which lost a dozen cadets during the course from an
original group of 42.
   A cadet who dropped out of the current training program said
last week that the recruits exercised for more than 10 hours the
first day on only a few small cups of water. Cadets who dropped out
of previous classes spoke of being pushed to their emotional and
physical limits.
   Griswold defended the academy's so-called stress training and
said she was never denied water or pushed beyond her limits. ``The
training is physically demanding but not physically abusive,'' she
said.
   ``Some people come here young and immature, never having been
yelled at on the street or in their lives,'' Griswold said. The
training ``helps us to be able to have patience at trying moments.''
   As police officers, she said, ``we know how much patience it
takes not to lash out when people call you vicious names, insult
your mother, spit on you or strike you. We learned to stand fast
and tolerate that in this very program that has come under fire.''
   The academy's training practices will come under review later
this week by a panel of doctors, exercise researchers and law
enforcement administrators appointed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   A team of investigators from the state attorney general's office
already is questioning witnesses about the case.

   Rep. Mike Lowry, Democratic Senate candidate
in Washington state, has an ulcer and is expected to remain
hospitalized in Chicago until later this week, according to a
statement released by his congressional office Tuesday.
   Lowry had been given two units of blood and was in good
condition at the intensive care unit of Resurrection Medical
Center, Dr. Stan Maslanka, Jr. said in the statement.
   Maslanka said there were no indications of any ``long-term''
problems and Lowry should be able to return to work in three or
four days.
   Lowry, 49, was on his way back from a weekend of campaigning
when he collapsed aboard a late-night ``red eye'' flight from
Seattle to Washington, D.C., early Monday. He was taken from the
United Airlines flight at O'Hare Airport in Chicago and carried by
ambulance to the hospital where tests showed he might have loss
blood.
   ``We have to monitor the blood count (oxygen level) to make sure
it doesn't drop,'' Maslanka said. ``I expect that his health will
be perfect again and I don't expect he'll have a recurrence if he
follows (diet) instructions I give him.''
   Kathleen Murphy, a Lowry spokeswoman who was in Chicago, said he
was in good condition and his spirits were high, but he was bored.
   ``He has his mind on a lot of things, including national health
care,'' she said.
   Staffers said Lowry had complained for several weeks of
bronchitis, the flu or a cold and had been unable to recover
because of his hectic schedule.

   ``But I also realize ... that the most important thing is that
the gospel of Jesus Christ will be preached, whether the church is
vinyl or painted,'' Svendsen said. ``And that will not change.''
   Church members decided in August to put vinyl siding on the
quaint, white church, the fourth-oldest church or meeting house in
Connecticut, as a way to preserve the building without the expense
of painting so often.
   But historians contend the move will harm the church's
appearance and could ultimately be destructive by hiding structural
problems such as moisture damage.
   Work is expected to begin in November and will cost about $8,000.
   The church was founded in 1770 by Capt. Sherebiah Butts and his
seven sons. Forty to 50 people attend services regularly today,
although only about 12 are voting members.
   Four large pillars grace the portico and a cross sits atop a
squared steeple. The church has been altered significantly several
times since it was built, but retains many original touches,
including a hanging balcony, wide-board flooring and hand-hewn
details in wooden pews.
   Outside stands a granite whipping post, once used for public
discipline. Behind the church, more than two dozen Revolutionary
War soldiers are buried.
   Representatives of the Canterbury Historical Society and the
Connecticut Historical Society urged the church's voting members
Monday night to abandon the vinyl plan, Svendsen said.
   The Canterbury Historical Society had offered to donate $5,000
toward a paint job, Svendsen said.
   ``We're not destroying the church. We're preserving it for
future generations,'' said A. Earl MacLeod, the church's deacon
emeritus. He said vinyl siding would cost about half as much as
painting and last as many as 40 years. A paint job lasts seven to
10 years.
   But Christopher P. Bickford, director of the Connecticut
Historical Society and a resident of Canterbury, said serious
historical and aesthetic damage would be wrought by vinyl siding.
   ``Eastern Connecticut is changing so very rapidly we ought to
try to hold onto those historical sites that are more or less
intact,'' Bickford said. ``Anyone who looks at a historical
building that has been covered (with siding) it just isn't the same
building. It becomes encased and mummified.''
   Susan Chandler, a historical architect with the Connecticut
Historical Commission, said vinyl siding can ultimately lead to the
destruction of historical buildings.
   ``There is a high potential for structural deterioration due to
the impervious nature of the new materials _ moisture, rot,
infestation,'' Chandler said. She said the siding can mean such
damage is undetected and ``you can get to the point of almost total
structural failure.''

Prize Tuesday night.
   The prize, sponsored by the General Foods Fund, Inc., recognizes
outstanding contributors to improving the quality, quantity or
availability of food in the world.
   ``Under Dr. Chandler's guidance, IRRI developed and distributed
new varieties of rice with double and triple the yield potential of
traditional rice,'' General Foods Fund said in a news release.
``Largely because of this, famine in Asia was averted in the
1970s.''

<HEAD>Quayle In Spotlight As Debate Tests Dukakis Strategy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate between vice presidential
candidates will go a long way toward determining whether George
Bush was wise when he picked Dan Quayle for a running mate _ and
whether Michael Dukakis was wise to make a major issue of it.
   Not that Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen
isn't sharing top billing in the 90-minute encounter in Omaha, with
all the potential political profits and perils that go with it.
   But after a campaign of controversy and criticism, Quayle is the
man in the spotlight.
   A positive performance by the 41-year-old Indiana senator, and
Bush's bid to spice his ticket with a handsome representative of a
younger generation will seem vindicated. Bentsen could seem every
bit of the 26 years older that he is.
   Republicans would then breathe a sigh of relief and hope nothing
happens before Election Day to reverse their seeming edge in the
campaign for the White House.
   A poor performance by Quayle, and the post-debate debate will
turn on whether Bush can somehow contain the resultant damage.
   Dukakis would step up the steady drumbeat of criticism that Bush
had picked a man not fit to be a heartbeat away from the White
House and trumpet the steady, mature experience of his man Bentsen.
   Bush took his lumps earlier in the campaign for picking Quayle.
His senior aides went to pains to tell reporters that the vice
president made his choice without their approval _ a sure sign that
he wouldn't have gotten it. The controversy over Quayle's
Vietnam-era service in the National Guard, his mediocre academic
record and the general furor produced a few suggestions that he
should consider leaving the ticket.
   He didn't and Bush stood by his man.
   Dukakis hasn't let up, though, in a less-noticed but still risky
campaign gamble.
   Traditional political tactics dictate that a candidate avoid
public disputes with a staff aide to a rival and that the man at
the top of the ticket not be drawn into a dispute with someone
further down.
   The reason is obvious _ as Walter F. Mondale found out in 1984
when he sought to brutalize Bush for offering blind loyalty to
Ronald Reagan. Bush, then the understudy on the GOP ticket, was
delighted to maintain a public quarrel with the leading Democrat,
leaving Reagan free to remain above the fray.
   Dukakis' aides insist that Quayle's selection gives them an
excellent issue, a window on the type of decision Bush would make
as president. But if Quayle performs well in the debate it could
well be that they missed their issue all along.
   Televised vice presidential debates are a relatively new
phenomenon in presidential campaigning. The first one was in 1976,
when Republican Bob Dole, trying to deflect a question about the
Watergate scandal, blurted out that World War I, World War II and
Korea were ``Democrat wars.''
   Democrat Walter F. Mondale replied that Dole had richly earned
his reputation as a hatchet-man, and the controversy that followed
was blamed by some Republicans for contributing to the narrow GOP
defeat that fall.''
   Four years ago a vice president named Bush debated his rival,
Democrat Geraldine Ferraro. The session is best remembered for
Bush's morning-after boast that he'd ``kicked a little ass.''
   Bush and the Republicans would be quite happy if this year's
debate produced nothing particularly memorable _ and if Quayle
avoided the temptation to brag about it afterwards.

   The Defense Department decided at the last
moment Tuesday to cancel an unveiling of its Stealth jet fighter,
forcing a senator to scrub a news conference and the Pentagon's
spokesman to reassert an official shroud of secrecy over the
radar-evading plane.
   By the time the behind-the-scenes maneuverings ended, there was
little doubt an airplane that officially doesn't exist, does.
   Doug Fuller, a spokesman for Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., said the
senator had planned to discuss the Stealth fighter program with
reporter Tuesday afternoon after the Pentagon released details
about the plane for the first time. According to defense sources,
the Stealth fighters built for the Air Force are based at a tightly
guarded facility in Hecht's state.
   ``He was going to discuss the program as a whole,'' said Fuller,
but the news conference was canceled after Hecht received a
telephone call from the Pentagon.
   ``We really haven't received much in the way of an explanation,
other than word from DOD that the department's release of
information has been put on indefinite hold,'' Fuller said. ``The
senator will respect that, of course. He's not going to release
information on his own.''
   The Washington Times had reported in Tuesday editions that the
Pentagon planned to release a short detail sheet and photograph of
the Stealth fighter this week, possibly as early as Tuesday.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, found himself unable
to acknowledge the department had been close to releasing
information on the jet, to explain why a public unveiling had been
canceled or to confirm there is such a thing as a Stealth fighter.
   ``I do not know of any briefing that is currently under
consideration to take place at any time in the foreseeable future
with regard to any special aircraft,'' Howard told reporters. ``I
can't provide any additional information to you. I'm sorry.''
   At another point, though, without referring to a Stealth
fighter, Howard said: ``I think you all understand that there are
proposals that arise from time to time from various levels within
this building and within the services to do briefings on this or
that weapon system and the like, and not all those proposals are
ultimately approved.
   ``In this case, I think the results are fairly obvious.''
   According to military and industry sources, the United States
secretly began building Stealth jet fighters in the mid-1970s and
now maintains more than 50 of the single-seat planes at the Nevada
base. The plane has been dubbed the F-19 by various industry
officials but reportedly also carries the military designation of
F-117A.
   The Pentagon and Air Force have never acknowledged the
airplane's existence, even when pressed about mysterious crashes
over the years.
   According to the sources, the planes are flown only at night and
are kept at a high state of readiness for use as ``aerial shock
troops,'' capable of slipping behind enemy lines without being
detected and creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs.
   Defense sources who requested anonymity said Tuesday the idea of
unveiling the plane had been debated at the highest levels of the
Defense Department and on Capitol Hill before being rejected ``for
the time being.''
   ``There were concerns at the top of the military hierarchy. And
there was a bipartisan view that this was not the most auspicious
time for this. Maybe later,'' said one official. Asked whether the
plane be unveiled after the presidential election, he replied:
``Possibly.''
   The sources said a proposal to show off the plane had been
advanced for several reasons.
   First, explained one official, the Air Force already has
announced it will unveil its new Stealth bomber next month and that
plane is based on more recent technological developments than the
fighter. The planes use special designs and materials to reduce
their exposure to radar.
   ``It doesn't make sense to let people see one and not the
other,'' the official noted.
   Moreover, the source continued, disclosing the fighter and its
successful record could help strengthen support on Capitol Hill for
the new wing of bombers.
   The sources said another factor supporting disclosure involved
an upcoming legal fight. Production line workers at a Lockheed
Corp. plant in Burbank, Calif., where the Stealth fighters are said
to be built, have gone to court with charges they are being
sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals.
   Pentagon officials have concluded the court fight is likely to
shatter the secrecy surrounding the plane.
   Howard appeared to lend weight to that argument Tuesday. Again
without referring specifically to the plane or to Lockheed, he
said: ``The litigation is one of the problems, but I just cannot
take this further.''

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, citing continuing
attempts to liberate nine American hostages in Lebanon, sought
Tuesday to dampen speculation about why an Indian-born U.S.
resident was freed.
   In the wake of Mithileshwar Singh's release, President Reagan
again ruled out negotiating with pro-Iranian elements holding nine
Americans, although he said dealing with the situation has been ``a
great problem for us.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government
was doing ``everything possible'' to get the hostages out. ``But
we're not negotiating, and we're not holding discussions that could
be construed as that,'' he said.
   Under intense questioning, Fitzwater declined repeatedly to tell
reporters what steps were being taken. But he acknowledged that
U.S. officials were bewildered by the circumstances behind the
release of Singh, believed to have been held by Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine, a pro-Iranian group.
   ``We continue to maintain various channels of communication,''
he said. ``You may assume that we would undertake all the analysis
possible.''
   Fitzwater would not say whether U.S. officials were attempting
to learn, through other governments and third-party contacts in the
Middle East, the reasons for Singh's release after 20 months in
captivity.
   ``We attribute no motives to his release. We don't know why they
did it or what they were seeking,'' the spokesman said. But he made
clear that engaging in public speculation about Iran's intentions
would be a disservice to the Americans still held captive.
   ``We simply wouldn't speculate on those kinds of things,''
Fitzwater said. ``We're not making any offers, not making deals.
We're not offering incentives.
   ``I guess our only point is that if improved relations (with the
United States) are desired, there are avenues to do that and the
first step is to release all the hostages _ today.''
   Saying hostage relatives in this country have frequently been
discouraged and disappointed over false signals of imminent
prisoner releases, Fitzwater said, ``I would say to these people
that we're working to get these hostages out.''
   Fitzwater mentioned specifically Peggy Say, the sister of
Associated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson, and
Virginia Steen, wife of Alann Steen. Anderson has been held longer
than the other hostages, since March 1985. And Mrs. Steen had her
hopes falsely raised with public reports of her husband's imminent
release Monday.
   The State Department, meanwhile, thanked Syria for facilitating
Singh's departure from Lebanon and also thanked ``those who played
a part'' in gaining his release.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley declined to specifically include
Iran, although she said it has influence with the hostage-holders
in Lebanon.
   ``We do not know why he was released and not the others,'' Mrs.
Oakley said. ``He does not have any information on it, either.''
   Singh, a business professor, told American diplomats in Damascus
he had seen the three other educators held by the Islamic Jihad,
but provided no information about their condition. ``We have no
indication about the fate of the other hostages,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   Singh, who is diabetic, will be questioned more thoroughly at a
U.S. military hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany. A ``debriefing
team'' headed by Assistant Secretary of State Michael Newlin will
meet with him, Mrs. Oakley said.
   The administration has steadfastly denied that it has undertaken
any talks directly with Iranian officials to get the hostages
released.
   The disclosure of clandestine arms sales to Iran, aimed at
securing the release of the prisoners during 1985 and 1986, led to
the Iran-Contra affair _ and ultimately led to the administration's
worst foreign policy controversy.
   While Fitzwater said U.S. officials did not know why Singh was
set free, he also said, ``I think it's an intentional attempt to
manipulate the (American) news media. ... ''
   ``I would just hope that as we go through this, the media should
remember some of the lessons they learned through Iran-Contra, just
as we did, and that is that everyone is subject to manipulation
here.''
   Reagan, asked whether he thought American hostages might soon be
set free, replied, ``I haven't seen any indication of that.''
   ``I just can't talk about it any further,'' he told reporters
during a Cabinet Room picture-taking session with Republican
congressional leaders.
   Asked if he thought Iran was attempting to manipulate the
outcome of the U.S. presidential election, Reagan smiled and said,
``Well, if they are, I hope they're on the right side.''
   According to records kept by the State Department's Office for
Counter-Terrorism, nine Americans and three Britons, including
Terry Waite, an emissary of the Anglican church in England; an
Italian, an Irishman and a Belgian are held in captivity in
Lebanon. However, other sources give other numbers.
   In a related development, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the former
president of Iran, said that secret hostage release negotiations
were conducted with Iran by an aide to Republican presidential
candidate George Bush, and that a new channel for U.S.-Iranian
links has been opened up.
   Bani-Sadr said that according to his information, a man named
Richard Lawless negotiated Singh's release.
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said: `Those assertions are
absolutely false. Absolutely no one is representing the vice
president, the office of the vice president or the campaign in any
dealings with the hostages, or any other dealings with Iran.''
   Fitzwater said, ``There is a fellow named Lawless. He is over
there. What he's up to, nobody knows. But he doesn't represent the
United States. ... He does not represent the vice president or the
president or anybody else.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Conrail Can't Get Paid By Amtrak For Claims From Fatal
Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail cannot seek indemnification from
Amtrak for damage claims arising from the deaths of 16 people last
year when a Conrail engine was hit by an Amtrak passenger train, a
federal judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled that the indemnification
agreement between Amtrak and Conrail cannot be enforced because of
evidence that gross and willful negligence by the Conrail crew
caused the Jan. 4, 1987 accident near Chase, Md.
   The collision occurred north of Baltimore after the Conrail
engineer and brakeman ignored a series of railroad signals before
the freight engine entered the path of an oncoming high-speed
Amtrak passenger train.
   If upheld, the ruling signed late Monday means that Conrail
would be solely responsible for defending more than 60 wrongful
death and personal injury suits that seek millions of dollars in
damages.
   ``Conrail is studying the decision and has no comment,''
spokeswoman Pat Linskey said Tuesday.
   Conrail had sought to force Amtrak to defend the suits and pay
any damages awarded under the terms of the Northeast Corridor
Freight Operating Agreement that provides that Amtrak pay for
claims ``irrespective of any negligence of fault of Conrail.''
   Gasch said that it was unclear, based on the language of the
agreement and the negotiating history, whether the parties intended
it to apply to cases of gross negligence.
   But even if the agreement were clear, ``public policy will not
allow enforcement of indemnification provisions that appear to
cover such extreme misconduct because serious and significant
disincentives to railroad safety would ensure,'' Gasch said.
   Gasch noted that the Conrail engineer, Ricky Lynn Gates, who
pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received a five-year prison
term, admitted the crew had used marijuana before the accident and
violated a number of safety procedures.

   Fire damaged a $1.75 million house
under construction for producer-entrepreneur Merv Griffin at a
desert country club Tuesday, and fire officials estimated damage at
$1 million.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately determined, officials
said.
   The fire was reported just before 7 a.m. in the PGA West Country
Club development near Palm Springs, said Tim Spann, spokesman for
the Riverside County Fire Department.
   The house, about 110 miles east of Los Angeles, was 80 percent
complete when it burned, ``And a little more than half of it was
destroyed,'' said fire Capt. Brenda Seabert.
   Griffin, the talk show host-turned TV producer-turned hotel
mogul, has many homes, once saying real estate is ``a nice
complement to show business.''
   Griffin, 63, taped his last ``Merv Griffin Show'' in September
1986, ending a 24-year career as a television talk show host. He
sold his production company soon afterward, but still produces
television movies, specials, comedy series and game shows,
including the successful ``Wheel of Fortune.''

<HEAD>Committee Recommendation Is Precursor To Gene Therapy Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recommendation from a federal advisory
committee that researchers be allowed to inject genetically altered
cells into humans for the first time as a diagnostic tool is a
precursor to the inevitable and more controversial question of
using similar techniques for experimental treatment.
   Despite the exotic aura and inevitable controversy surrounding
most cutting-edge medical research, such mainstream organizations
as the March of Dimes are firmly in favor of pressing forward with
gene therapies.
   The recommendation from a National Institutes of Health advisory
committee Monday involves allowing researchers to place genetically
altered cells in terminally ill cancer patients to help them better
judge the success of ongoing experimental treatment that does not
use gene therapy directly.
   ``If this protocol were to work, I'd expect that within six to
12 months there could be a proposal to do a gene therapy
experiment,'' said Dr. William J. Gartland, executive secretary of
the NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.
   Although the panel's recommendation would have to be embraced by
NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden and the Food and Drug
Administration before the experiments could be carried out,
Gartland's remarks indicated that is likely to be forthcoming.
   But because the panel split 16-5 on the question, Wyngaarden is
likely to take several months to review the matter before making
his own recommendation, said Gartland.
   Gadfly Jeremy Rifkin has conducted a decade-long battle to get
the federal government to adopt safeguards on genetic research, but
he said Tuesday that he did not oppose the NIH committee's action.
   ``I do not oppose this experiment,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``This experiment is a precursor to the first genetic
engineering of a human being.''
   It is that next step, he said, that ``has more profound
long-term ethical implications than any technology in history.''
   Rifkin, head of the Foundation on Economic Trends, renewed his
call for the government to set up a permanent oversight mechanism _
at NIH or elsewhere _ to deal on a case-by-case basis with each
potential genetic engineering experiment as it comes up.
   He said he does not automatically oppose all genetic therapy.
   ``You want to find those things that work and accept them,'' he
said. The key, he said, is ``we don't want the technology to rush
ahead of the social and ethical implications.''
   Meanwhile, the March of Dimes is marking its 50th anniversary
year with a plan to focus money and attention on gene therapy.
   Opera star Beverly Sills outlined the program last November in a
speech to the National Press Club.
   Miss Sills, general director of the New York City Opera and
mother of two children with birth defects, acknowledged that
advocating gene therapy is likely to be more controversial than the
foundation's successful fight against polio.
   But she said that is largely because gene therapy is surrounded
by ``much misconception.''
   ``One fact must be made clear,'' she said. ``What we are talking
about is fixing or replacing genetic material for the lifetime of
one desperately ill person.
   ``The characteristics of the transplanted gene will not be
passed on to future generations. The goal of gene therapy is that
of any other medical treatment _ the reduction of suffering and the
restoration of health in individual patients.''
   The March of Dimes has helped finance genetic research for years
and foundation President Charles L. Massey acknowledged that a main
purpose of the campaign planned for the coming year will be to lend
the group's credibility to the potential of gene therapy.
   ``Gene therapy is not yet a reality, but it will be, probably
far sooner than expected only a year or so ago and the March of
Dimes will be there,'' Miss Sills said last November.

<HEAD>Couple Takes Fight to State Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pennsylvania couple is asking a Florida
judge to order a genetic blood test to determine if a 9-year-old
Sarasota girl is theirs.
   The girl who Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., suspect
is their daughter is living in a broken home without ``an ongoing,
stable home environment,'' the couple said in a motion filed Monday
in Sarasota Circuit Court.
   The Twiggs charged in court papers that the girl's father
``wrongfully retains custody'' and has failed to provide a caring
home.
   In response, a lawyer representing the girl's father contends
the Twiggs intend to ``disrupt the happiness and well-being'' of
the child.
   The search for the child the Twiggs maintain was kidnapped at
birth and switched in a tiny Central Florida hospital nursery took
a bitter turn with the latest motion, said Arthur Ginsburg, who
represents the girl's father.
   ``We went to them with an olive branch, and they came to us with
a sword. They really don't know anything about this father and
daughter; he has a deep love for his child,'' Ginsburg said.
   Sarasota Circuit Judge Andy Owens has agreed to schedule an
emergency hearing Friday to consider a request for court-ordered
genetic testing designed to determine the girl's biological parents.
   The father insists the child does not belong to the other couple.
   Neither side has identified the Sarasota girl or her relatives
to protect her privacy.
   The Twiggs say they left Hardee Memorial Hospital in 1978 with a
sickly child who they subsequently learned was not their own. They
have filed a $100 million lawsuit in federal court in Tampa
claiming that the hospital swapped their healthy girl for one with
heart problems in order to facilitate an adoption.
   The Twiggs discovered this summer through genetic blood tests
that the baby they named Arlena was not their daughter, but never
told her before her death on Aug. 23.
   The couple suspect their daughter is the Sarasota girl, a
blue-eyed blonde who was the only other white child reported to
have shared the hospital nursery with baby Arlena.
   The father consented to genetic testing to put the matter to
rest, but both sides never agreed on conditions _ the legal father
wanted to choose the facility and keep the results confidential _
so voluntary testing is off, attorneys said.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To End Sludge Dumping By 1993</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday passed a much-debated
bill that bans the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean after 1992.
   The measure, adopted by a 416-0 vote, sets a Dec. 31, 1992
deadline on sludge dumping by the nation's only remaining
practitioners: nine sewage authorities located in New York and New
Jersey.
   The compromise bill, climaxing a 10-year legislative effort,
must now be reconciled with a differing version passed by the
Senate in August.
   Sponsors of the House and Senate bills say they expect to
reconcile differences at conference sessions beginning Wednesday.
Among other things, the Senate bill sets a Dec. 31, 1991 deadline _
a year earlier than the House.
   ``I think there's room for compromise,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., sponsor of the Senate version.
   Under the House plan, drafted by a bipartisan coalition of East
Coast lawmakers, sludge dumpers would be forced to stop by the 1992
deadline or face stiff penalties.
   ``These penalties will add up to tens of millions of dollars in
a very short time. There's no question but that the fines will make
it financially prohibitive for municipalities to continue dumping
in the ocean beyond the deadline,'' said Rep. William Hughes,
D-N.J., a prime sponsor of the ban.
   Rep. H. James Saxton, R-N.J., called the bill, ``a vitory in the
continuing fight for clean oceans.''
   Some eight million wet tons of sludge a year are dumped by the
nine agencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey.
Congress closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.
   Experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping
of sludge.
   The new bill imposes fees to dumpers of $200 a ton beginning
Jan. 1, 1989.
   Dumpers meanwhile would be required to negotiate individual
timetables for ending their dumping with federal authorities.
   Those agencies that cannot strike a deal will pay staggered fees
through 1992 of up to $400 a ton.
   Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would be
forced to pay penalties over and above the fees. Those fines begin
at $800 per ton and more than double that by 1999.
   New York alone would be liable for more than $1.3 billion if the
state is still dumping by the year 2000.
   The proposed ban was at first opposed by New York lawmakers and
New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, who complained that the deadline
would be impossible to meet.
   Proponents countered that Congress orginally banned ocean sludge
dumping as of 1981, a deadline suspended in a successful lawsuit by
New York. The original deadline was set in a 1978 law, after which
some 300 industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping.
   The compromise was reached after inclusion of a system of trust
funds, under which fees and fines would be used to develop
alternatives to dumping.
   The political climate became right for the bill this year, after
repeated and widely-publicized incidents of beach pollution.

   President Reagan argued Tuesday that even
though voters might be ``a little cautious'' about voting
Republican this fall, the election will ultimately be a referendum
on the future of the Democratic Party.
   ``It's way too early to say that this is the realignment
election,'' Reagan said in remarks prepared for a speech to the
Governors' Club, a group of GOP state chief executives. ``But I do
think many rank-and-file Democrats are getting in a mood to say to
their party leadership: `You've gone too far to the left. Return to
the political mainstream.'''
   The president addressed the club's fund-raising dinner, expected
to glean $750,000 for the Republican National Committee.
   He cited GOP gains from 1984 in states like Texas and North
Carolina. This year, he said, ``I've been out on the campaign trail
lately and I'm just starting to wonder if this year there isn't
something in the air.''
   Since the convention, Reagan has gleaned millions of dollars for
the GOP with his speaking appearances on behalf of Vice President
George Bush's quest for the White House.
   A one-time Democrat himself, Reagan acknowledged that it's
difficult to get people to change their loyalties.
   ``There's plenty of disenchantment out there with that other
party, but we have to realize that people are still a little
cautious about our party,'' Reagan said.
   The president did not detail what might make voters tentative
about the Republicans. But he argued that many Democrats have been
attracted by his party's long-time anti-tax and anti-big government
stands, as well as ``a whole range of social issues from the Pledge
of Allegiance to school prayer to the radical agenda of some
far-left legal groups.''
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis for vetoing a state law that would have forced
Massachusetts teachers to lead their students in reciting the
Pledge each day.
   Reagan said ``this campaign may be starting to break out as a
referendum on liberalism itself, a referendum on the direction in
which the liberals have taken the once-proud Democratic Party.''
   ``The public agrees with us when we say we are for the death
penalty, school prayer, tough law enforcement and against liberal
organizations like the ACLU that always seem to be searching for
technicalities to exonerate criminals,'' Reagan argued, echoing
Bush's criticism of Dukakis for being a self-proclaimed
``card-carrying member'' of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Rank-and-file Democrats are going to say `no' to the liberal
leadership (of the Democratic Party) by saying `yes' to George Bush
and the Republican Party,'' Reagan told his partisan audience.

   A national poll Tuesday said the Democratic
presidential ticket was benefiting from doubts about Republican
vice presidential nominee Sen. Dan Quayle. It put the race at
essentially a dead heat.
   The Republican ticket of George Bush and Quayle drew the support
of 48 percent of the probable voters in the CBS News-New York Times
poll, while the Democrats, Michael Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
got 46 percent.
   When the 1,034 respondents were asked what if they were voting
only for the presidential nominees, without their running mates,
the support for Dukakis declined to 43 percent, CBS reported.
Bush's remained at 48 percent.
   That finding indicated that Quayle, while not cutting into
Bush's own support, was pushing some undecided voters to Dukakis.
Quayle, of Indiana, and Bentsen, of Texas, meet in their only
debate of the campaign Wednesday night.
   In another measure of concern about Quayle, respondents were
split evenly on whether he understands the complicated problems a
president has to deal with: Forty-one percent said he does, but 40
percent said not.
   On Bentsen, by contrast, 71 percent said he does understand the
problems a president must confront, and only 13 percent said not.
   The 48-46 race was a statistical dead heat given the poll's
margin of error or plus or minus three percentage points. A
CBS-Times poll done Sept. 21-23 put the race at 49 percent for Bush
and Quayle to 44 percent for Dukakis and Bentsen, also a
statistical tie given the error margin.
   The new survey was conducted Saturday through Monday.

   ``Frank's Place,'' the critically acclaimed but
low- rated comedy starring Tim Reid as the owner of a Creole
restaurant in New Orleans, was canceled Tuesday by the CBS
television network.
   ``Frank's Place'' was named best comedy by the Television
Critics Association in August. Later that month, its
creator-producer Hugh Wilson won an Emmy for writing. Reid, the
show's co-executive producer, was nominated for an Emmy as lead
actor in a comedy.
   CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters did not put the show
on the network's fall schedule but promised it would be added later
when a suitable time period could be found. But he said in a
statement released by CBS on Tuesday that it would not return.
   While it had support from CBS, television critics and a broad
spectrum of the entertainment community, LeMasters said,
``Unfortunately, the viewing audience simply failed to respond to
it.''
   The show started out on Monday nights, but was later moved in
CBS' ill-fated attempt to program comedies on Tuesday night. Then
it was shunted off to the low-rated Saturday lineup where it has
languished in or near last place in the Nielsens. Its last
broadcast was last Saturday.
   In another development, Fox Broadcasting Co. is scrapping its
on-again, off-again ``The Late Show'' after two troubled years.
   In Los Angeles, Fox spokesman Brad Turell said word on a
replacement for the `The Late Show' should come later this week.
   ``The Late Show,'' the first effort by the network, made its
debut in October 1986 with Joan Rivers as the host. The show was
plagued by low ratings and Rivers was fired in May 1987.
   Arsenio Hall became the permanent host in summer 1987, after a
series of rotating hosts. It was replaced with ``The Wilton North
Report,'' which was panned by the critics and ignored by the
audience.
   It was canceled after four weeks and replaced by a new version
of ``The Late Show'' with comedians Jeff Joseph and John Mulrooney
as rotating hosts.
   In April, Ross Shafer, a former Seattle radio and television
personality and comedian, became host.

   Israel's election campaign began in earnest
Tuesday with both major parties trading accusations about an
``Israeli Watergate'' and running television ads to woo undecided
voters.
   Politicians came out swinging at the end of the Jewish holiday
period, ending weeks of low-key campaigning for the Nov. 1 election.
   The campaign's first confrontation between the right-wing Likud
bloc and the left-of-center Labor Party focused on what has been
called the ``Israeli Watergate,'' after the scandal that forced
President Nixon to resign in 1974.
   Likud accused Labor of bugging Likud campaign headquarters and
of tapping the home phone of campaign chairman Moshe Arens, a
Cabinet minister and former ambassador to the United States.
   ``This is a serious affair,'' said Likud spokesman Danny Naveh.
``We have serious suspicions that this is an Israeli Watergate, and
that Labor is responsible.''
   Asked about evidence, Naveh said Arens heard clicking in his
line and the minister's wife saw prowlers in her yard last week.
   Shimon Peres, the Labor Party chief and foreign minister in the
coalition government formed with Likud after a 1984 election
stalemate, denounced the allegations as ridiculous and without
foundation.
   ``This is puppet theater, and I don't see any real person there
on stage,'' Peres during a campaign swing in northern Israel.
   Added Ezer Weizman, Labor's campaign leader: ``They are in a
panic because our campaign is better than theirs.''
   Naveh also said that Labor hired two former agents of Israel's
Shin Bet security service to spy on Likud. Labor officials denied
the allegation, saying the two were consultants providing security
for party facilities.
   Likud officials asked Attorney General Yosef Harish to
investigate Labor, Israel radio said. Harish said he would consider
the request.
   Israeli commentators predicted the affair would not have a
far-reaching impact.
   ``This mutual mudslinging is just part of the campaign heating
up,'' said Emanuel Gutmann, a political science professor at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. ``I wouldn't get excited about it.''
   Earlier in the campaign, a squabble broke out over a recorded
Labor Party telephone message with the sounds of sirens and
breaking glass that suggested Shamir's policies would lead to war.
   ``Shamir said `no' to the peace with Egypt, he said `no' to King
Hussein. Shamir said `yes' to the inflation, `yes' to the
intefadeh, he will say `yes' to the next war,'' the announcer said.
   Enraged Likud activists kept the telephone line busy.
   Intefadeh is the Arabic term used to describe the 10-month
Palestinian uprising in Israel's occupied territories.
   Also Tuesday, the parties launched television campaign ads
designed to sway undecided voters, estimated by polls at more than
25 percent of the electorate.
   The ads will play a particularly important role because the
state-owned Israel TV and radio stations are banned from
broadcasting interviews with candidates in the final 30 days before
the vote.
   In their television spots, Shamir and Peres referred to the
Palestinian uprising only briefly, although both parties have
called Middle East peace the crucial issue of the campaign.
   Both men laid claim to Israel's economic recovery, and Peres
took credit for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 1985.
   Likud presented slick spots with an upbeat jingle, flag-waving
children and Shamir calling for a fair campaign. Little mention was
made of Labor or its policies.
   Labor was more aggressive, contrasting its positions to Likud's.
A stern-voiced announcer said hyperinflation and entanglement in
Lebanon came after Likud had been in the government seven years.
   Israel radio said each side had prepared uncomplimentary film
clips and would use them if the other side engaged in ``character
assassination.''
   Israeli voters will be exposed to about 1,000 minutes of
television campaign spots before the election. Clusters of ads are
run in a 45-minute period after the evening news.
   Each of the 28 parties running for 120 seats in the Knesset is
allotted 10 minutes of television time. In addition, parties now
represented in parliament get six minutes for each seat. Labor and
Likud have more than four hours each of free television time.
   Radio ads begin Wednesday.
   Elihu Katz, a pollster and founding director of Israel
television, criticized the ban on TV and radio coverage of
candidates, saying voters were being deprived of valuable
information.
   But he said the campaign ads ``waste a huge amount of money. The
large parties have so much time they could run quiz shows and soap
operas.''

<HEAD>New Communist Party Leader Named in Latvia</HEAD>

   Jan Vagris was elected Tuesday to head the
Communist Party in the Baltic republic of Latvia, succeeding Boris
Pugo who was transferred to Moscow last week.
   Vagris had served as chairman of the Presidium of the Latvian
Supreme Soviet, or legislature, since 1985. The official Tass news
agency said he was elected first secretary of the Latvian Communist
Party at a plenary meeting of the Latvian Central Committee,
   Pugo, who had headed the Latvian party since April 1984, was
promoted last Friday to become chairman of the Soviet Communist
Party's Control Committee, which oversees the maintenance of party
discipline.
   Pugo replaced Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 75, who retired.
   Tass said Pugo made a speech at the Central Committee meeting
Tuesday in Riga but it gave no details.
   Under political reforms pursued by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, local Communist Party chiefs are to stand for election.
   Vagris' election as the party chief in Latvia was believed to be
the first instance under Gorbachev's program where the current head
of a legislature was subsequently named leader of the local party
rather than the other way around.
   Gorbachev, the Soviet party's general secretary, introduced
major changes last week, retiring President Andrei A. Gromyko and
succeeding him as head of state.
   Tass said Vagris, 56 and an engineer by training, ``is well
conversant with economic problems.''
   ``He pays much attention to social issues, to studying the daily
concerns and needs of common people and extending democracy,'' the
agency said.

   Showers dotted many parts of the country Tuesday and
temperatures slipped lower as autumn began to make itself felt.
Farmers in the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley were
advised to watch for nighttime freezing.
   The worst weather was in Upper Michigan, where brisk northerly
winds blowing across lakes Michigan and Superior combined with
temperatures in the mid 30s to create a wind chill as low as 11
degrees. The cool air and moisture also brought snow showers, sleet
and light rain to the area.
   Showers fell over western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and
western Kansas. In the East, rain lingered along the coasts of
North Carolina, Virginia and the New England. Florida had scattered
thunderstorms.
   Clear skies and cool temperatures spread across the northern
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, prompting freeze advisories
for Tuesday night for Iowa, Minnesota, northern Illinois, northeast
Kansas, southwest Nebraska, most of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan
and northwest Lower Michigan.
   In the West, rain and fog spread over western Oregon and
Washington.
   Temperatures Tuesday afternoon only reached the 30s in northwest
Nebraska, western Kansas and eastern Colorado, and the 40s in the
northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, and
northern New England.
   Temperatures were in the 70s in most of Texas, the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast states, the southern Atlantic
coast, the Southwest and parts of California, and in the 80s in
southern Florida and the desert Southwest.
   The rest of the country had temperatures in the 50s and 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Imperial, Neb., to 98 degrees at Phoenix and Yuma, Ariz.
   The low early Tuesday was 17 degrees at Bismarck, N.D.
   Showers were forecast for Wednesday in New England, the lower
Great Lakes and northern Appalachians, with scattered showers and
thunderstorms in southern Florida. It will be cloudy in the Pacific
Northwest, cloudy to partly cloudy over the western Plains and
sunny elsewhere.
   Wednesday's highs were expected in the 40s from the Great Lakes
to the northern Appalachians and in northern New England; in the
70s from coastal California to the central and southern Rockies, in
southern Texas and along the Gulf Coast to northern Florida,
Georgia and South Carolina; in the 80s in southern Florida, the
Southwest and California's inland valleys, with temperatures up to
105 degrees in the desert.
   The rest of the nation will be seasonably cool, with highs in
the 50s and 60s.

<HEAD>Honduras Asks Help To Expel Nicaraguan, Salvadoran Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honduras, which has been a key U.S. ally
in Central America, asked the U.N. Tuesday to set up an
international peace force to evacuate U.S.-backed Nicaraguan and
leftist Salvadoran rebels from Honduran territory.
   In a speech delivered to the General Assembly, Foreign Minister
Carlos Lopez Contreras of Honduras recommended that U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar oversee creation of a
peace force comprised of troops from Canada, Spain and West Germany.
   The force's duties would include relocating Honduran-based,
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, and Salvadoran rebels to Costa
Rica and Guatemala initially and then resettle them elsewhere,
Lopez Contreras said.
   He said the force would ``guarantee the non-use'' of Honduran
territory by foreign armed insurgencies.
   Lopez Contreras underscored his apparent disassociation from
U.S. policy by describing the United States, along with the Soviet
Union, as a ``hegemonistic power'' _ one with a policy or practice
of aggressively expanding its influence over other countries.
   His proposal represents a revised and updated version of a plan
Honduras unveiled last November and seemed aimed primarily at the
thousands of Contras based in southern Honduras along the
Nicaraguan border.
   The number of Contras in Honduras has increased substantially
this year as fighting in Nicaragua has subsided.
   Leftist rebels from El Salvador, who have been trying to oust
the U.S.-supported government there since 1980, have made far less
use of Honduran territory.
   Honduras has been a major element in Reagan administration
strategy to prevent, through support for the Contras, Nicaragua
from becoming a Soviet beachhead.
   But Honduras always has been wary of the Contras' use of
Honduran territory as their main base of operation. Washington has
sought to soften that reticence by giving Honduras substantial
economic help.
   Lopez Contreras also tore into Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government Tuesday, accusing it of failing to comply with peace
agreements it signed and of pursuing policies that forced hundreds
of thousands of Nicaraguans to flee their homeland. He accused it
of engaging in ``an irrational arms race.''
   ``It is a universally recognized truth that the Central American
crisis is a complex international problem, and as a consequence,
the international community must assume the responsibility of
maintaining peace and regional security, without excluding an
international peace force,'' he said.
   Such a unit, Lopez Contreras said, should be authorized to use
force, if necessary, to carry out its mandate.
   ``The people and the government of Honduras cannot continue
carrying the burden they have been suffering for nine years, caused
by the presence of tens of thousands of Central American
refugees,'' the Honduran minister declared.
   Reagan administration officials have been receiving signals for
weeks that Honduran patience with the Contras was wearing thin.
Under an agreement signed by the Sandinistas and the Contras last
March, the insurgents were to be allowed to receive U.S.
humanitarian aid inside Nicaragua.
   Because of political disagreements and other problems, the
United States has not sent any aid to Contras in Nicaragua. As a
result, thousands fled to the border area, where the U.S. Agency
for International Development has been operating a program that
includes food, shelter, clothing and medical services for the
rebels.
   Last February, Congress defeated an administration proposal for
military aid for the Contras and little prospect remains that such
aid will be renewed, raising the possibility of the rebels staying
in Honduras indefinitely.
   Honduran officials repeatedly said that would be unacceptable.

   Police carried or roughly dragged about 360
anti-abortion demonstrators at three clinics to jail-bound buses
Tuesday, making good on a threat of gloves-off treatment for a
planned week of similar protests.
   Some of the sit-in protesters screamed or cried as they were
hauled off and left in piles by jail bus doors to be carried aboard
by other officers. Many supporters watching the arrests sobbed or
prayed quietly. Others sang hymns or songs from the civil rights
movement.
   Police asked the demonstrators if they would walk to the buses
and dragged them there when they would not.
   They were still being processed at Atlanta jails late Tuesday
afternoon. a Police spokeswoman Myrna May said most were being
charged with criminal trespass, although she did not have a
specific breakdown on the charges. She said none of the charges
were felonies.
   Since summer, hundreds of anti-abortion protesters in Atlanta
have identified themselves upon arrest as Baby John Doe or Baby
Jane Doe. Since authorities will not release people on bond without
identification, those arrested have crowded jails. Three summer
demonstrators remained jailed, one for more than 70 days.
   The stated aim of the protests Tuesday was to close the clinics
for the day, although some women entered at least one clinic during
the protests. The demonstrators did not enter the buildings.
   The protests were organized by Operation Rescue, a New
York-based group that started demonstrating in Atlanta on July 19
during the Democratic National Convention and continued to do so
through the summer, landing more than 750 people in jail.
   At two locations police used disposable plastic handcuffs on
those arrested and in one case tackled a man who had been loaded
into a van but tried to escape.
   Some were urged along by police putting thumbs under the ears
and lifting. The demonstrators offered no resistance, and most
remained limp while they were carried off.
   A few officers were in riot gear or on horseback.
   Operation Rescue, which has opened what it says is a permanent
office in Atlanta, charged that excessive force was used.
   Gene Guerrero, executive director of the state chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, who watched the arrests, said,
``I've been to a lot of demonstrations and I've seen a lot of
police brutality. I haven't seen that today.''
   Police officials announced last week that they would not use the
relatively gentle arrest methods they used during the convention.
   Police tactics already had grown rougher during the summer as a
series of anti-abortion sit-ins taxed city and county resources,
costing more than $500,000 in police overtime, jail expenses and
court time.
   Late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Joel Fryer
barred Operation Rescue from ``harassing or assaulting'' anyone
going to or from any abortion clinic or from recruiting others to
do so, with a $500 fine for each violation.
   The judge ordered lawyers from both sides to agree on how close
demonstrators can go to the clinics. Operation Rescue lawyer Bob
Fierer said he would not negotiate because his clients do not
intend to obey the order.
   Tuesday's demonstrators crawled under portable metal barriers
erected at the clinics by police and were arrested when they got to
the other side.
   Police called an ambulance for a pregnant woman who lay by a bus
door in apparent pain after others had been loaded, but she got on
the bus after the ambulance arrived.
   ``We got plenty room left if any y'all want to go along,''
shouted one officer through a bullhorn to sympathizers on a
sidewalk across a narrow side street from one clinic. No one did.
   Aside from an occasional insult from a passing car there were no
counter-demonstrators.
   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, arrested Monday evening
on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime, was freed before the
demonstration Tuesday after an unidentified family posted a $75,000
property bond.
   Terry appeared Tuesday morning as about 800 abortion opponents
gathered at a motel on the edge of Atlanta before heading for the
clinics. Even the demonstrators were not told to which of the seven
clinics that perform abortions in Atlanta they were going to until
shortly before they arrived.
   They went from the motel to the area where the clinics are by
public transportation in an apparent attempt to avoid being stopped
ahead of time by police.
   ``The blood is on our hands,'' Terry told the group. ``We are
here 15 years too late. There are no heroes here.''
   Cries of ``Hallelujah'' and ``Oh, yes, Lord'' came from one
large group, some of whose members were speaking in tongues. One
woman passed out plastic rosaries.

   The District of Columbia Department of
Corrections closed the city's crowded prison system to new inmates
Tuesday to comply with a court order.
   City Corrections Director Hallem Williams said the policy means
that the federal government is responsible for finding places to
incarcerate new prisoners. He said he could provide no specifics
about arrangements.
   But a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service, Steve Boyle, said
officials from the Justice Department were ``still trying to decide
how to resolve the problem.''
   The city stopped admitting new inmates to its jail because of an
order issued last Thursday by U.S. District Judge William B. Bryant
that the district reduce its jail population to under 1,694
prisoners. That order took effect at noon Tuesday, when there were
1,942 prisoners at the jail, according to Williams.
   ``At this juncture we have no remaining alternatives to deal
with today's crisis,'' said Williams. ``We are in a crisis
situation. Everywhere we step, there is a minefield.''
   The action also meant that new inmates were also being barred
from the city's Lorton Correctional Complex in nearby Fairfax
County, Va.
   A separate appeals court ruling, also issued last Thursday,
requires the city to reduce the population at Lorton's Central
facility to 1,166 by Nov. 1. There were 1,406 inmates at Lorton on
Tuesday.
   Corrections officials were scheduled to present their plan for
alleviating overcrowding to Bryant on Wednesday morning.
   On Monday, district Mayor Marion Barry authorized the early
release of 350 prisoners from the entire system by Nov. 11,
Williams announced at a news conference Tuesday.
   About 130 inmates will be sent to other jurisdictions, such as
the state of Washington, over the next three weeks.
   And the city is setting up a program in which it pays
contractors to post bond of $2,000 or less and then monitor certain
poor inmates awaiting trial, at a cost to the district of up to
$300,000.
   Williams said the city had not choice but to take the actions.
   ``It's not a situation where there's a winner or a loser,'' he
said. ``It's a situation where there are lots of losers.''

   A former mayoral candidate who was the
city's chief administrator for 10 years has been indicted with 13
others for having sex with teen-age girls at a brothel.
   The indictments Monday followed a 16-month investigation into an
operation police say earned $20,000 a week by providing prostitutes
as young as 14 to customers in the San Francisco Bay area, Los
Angeles, Idaho and Washington.
   Roger Boas, chief executive under former Mayors George Moscone
and Dianne Feinstein, was allegedly identified by five underage
prostitutes as the regular client they knew as ``George.'' The
67-year-old car dealer and politician later was picked out of a
photo lineup in front of a grand jury.
   Boas, who also served from 1962 to 1973 as a city supervisor,
ran for mayor last year, coming in a close third.
   In a three-minute appearance before reporters Tuesday, Boas did
not deny involvement with prostitutes and refused to answer
questions on the subject. He hinted he was being targeted unfairly
by District Attorney Arlo Smith.
   ``During my entire life, I have always done my utmost to be
constructive, honest and productive,'' he said. ``For my family's
sake ... I am truly saddened that someone in the criminal justice
system tried to convict me in the media using leaks, rumors and
innuendo in advance of the legal process.''
   His attorney, John Keker, said he expected Boas to be acquitted
of all charges.
   Boas, his attorney and Smith would not disclose specifics of the
indictment. The San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco
Examiner reported on the indictments extensively, quoting
unidentified City Hall sources.
   Boas reportedly faces 18 counts of unlawful sex with minors
during the last three years.
   Those indicted faced possible felony charges that could carry up
to three years in prison.
   The girls told police they had been coached to act as young as
possible with their clients, who they were told paid a premium for
sex with minors.
   A 32-year-old police officer, Patrick Miyagishima, reportedly
faces two counts of having unlawful sex with a minor.
   ``I'm not even admitting my client was there (at the brothel),''
said Miyagishima's attorney, William Murphy.
   A prominent jeweler, John Azevedo, 46, was charged with four
counts of having unlawful sex with minors, according to his
attorney, Patrick Hallinan.
   Hallinan acknowledged that Azevedo had sex with prostitutes
``four or five times'' at his store during the past four years. But
the lawyer said his client had no idea they were so young.
   ``This is a terrible, terrible personal tragedy for my client
that's motivated so clearly only by the district attorney's desire
to cover the fact that he is really out to get Boas,'' Hallinan
said.

<HEAD>Sources Say Government Reaches Settlement in LSD Experiments
Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday tentatively settled a
lawsuit by eight Canadians who claimed they suffered psychological
trauma from CIA-financed mind-control experiments that included
doses of LSD, sources said.
   The lawsuit claimed $8 million in damages the plaintiffs said
they suffered from behavior-modification treatments administered in
the late 1950s by a Montreal psychiatrist whose research was
financed covertly by the CIA.
   The case was scheduled to go to trial this week before U.S.
District Judge John Garrett Penn, but Justice Department attorneys
tentatively have agreed to settle the case by paying the plaintiffs
a total of $750,000, according to one source familiar with the case
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Justice Department lawyers plan to ask Penn on Wednesday to
postpone the trial while their superiors review the proposed
out-of-court settlement, according to other sources familiar with
the case.
   The Justice Department must formally approve all settlements for
more than $200,000 that are negotiated by government lawyers.
   The 1980 lawsuit filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act
originally sought $1 million for each of nine plaintiffs. Penn
dismissed one of the plaintiffs, ruling that her claim was barred
by statute of limitations.
   But under the terms of the tentative agreement, she will share
in the settlement, according to a source.
   The mind-control experiments were conducted by the late Dr. D.
Ewen Cameron, who headed the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill
University in Montreal.
   Cameron received nearly $60,000 over three years from a
CIA-front organization called the Society for the Investigation of
Human Ecology, according to a government summary of the case in
court records.
   There is no evidence that Cameron ever knew that the grants he
received were financed by the CIA, the summary states.
   Only two of the nine original plaintiffs were given LSD therapy
during the time the CIA financed Cameron's research, according to
court papers. But they underwent other forms of treatment such as
unusually intense electroshock therapy or a technique known as
``psychic driving'' in which patients listen to a recorded message
repeatedly for up to 16 hours.
   Several patients were given LSD therapy during other treatments
by Cameron before or after the three-year period he received CIA
money.
   The research organization was part of a project started in 1953
by then-CIA Director Allen Dulles to finance mind-control research,
including experiments with LSD on unwitting subjects.
   Project MKULTRA was begun at the height of the Cold War out of
concern that the Soviet Union and China had obtained a stock of
LSD, according to former CIA officials who gave depositions in the
case.
   Former CIA director Richard Helms, who was the agency's
operations director in the late 1950s, recalled, ``There was
concern that the Russians or the Chinese might use this on our
people, might use it on our public officials.''
   In his deposition, Helms recalled an incident when George
Kennan, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, flew to Berlin and made ``a
most extraordinary series of statements which were regarded ... as
quite uncharacteristic of Mr. Kennan's normal behavior.''
   ``There was, therefore, a feeling that perhaps he had been
administered something of this kind which caused him to act in an
aberrant way,'' Helms testified.
   This incident prompted Dulles to order research into LSD, Helms
recalled.
   The research organization that financed Cameron was set up in
1955 after the suicide of Frank Olson, who was among a group of
scientists who were given after-dinner drinks laced with LSD. After
Olson's death, the CIA decided that experimentation on unwitting
subjects could be conducted only under closer medical supervision.
   The plaintiffs informally lowered their demands for payment to
$175,000 apiece during earlier negotiations. The CIA offered to pay
only $25,000 to each plaintiff during aborted talks several years
ago.

<HEAD>1988 Model Year Is 3rd Best</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers posted their third-best sales year in
history Tuesday, as car and light truck buyers in the United States
drove away more than 15.6 million vehicles during the 1988 model
year, the companies reported.
   With a few of the small-volume foreign makers holding sales
figures until Wednesday, companies selling cars and light trucks in
the United States said they sold 0.7 percent more vehicles in 1988
than the 15.5 million vehicles sold during the 1987 model year.
   ``That's pretty good, all things considered, when they (were)
expected to be flat or down a bit,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol
of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York.
   ``I think it's particularly surprising in light of what the
initial expectations were post-Oct. 19 of last year'' when the
stock market crashed, said analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Sterns
& Co. of New York. ``I was looking more for 14 million in that
period. I had to consistently raise it through the period.''
   The 1988 model year ran behind 1986, when 16.1 million vehicles
left showrooms, and 1985 when 15.7 million cars and light trucks
were sold.
   While the annual total was upbeat, sales during the last 10-day
period were sharply lower than a year ago, when end-of-model-year
fire sales and lingering incentives attracted people to dealerships.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars fell 9.1 percent to 250,416 from 275,461
during the Sept. 21-30 period this year, compared with the same
period last year. There were nine selling days in both periods.
   U.S.-made truck sales, meanwhile, gained slightly in late
September, rising to 131,915 in the period this year, compared with
130,144 at the same time last year, a 1.4 percent increase.
   For the month, sales of domestically made trucks rose 5.3
percent, to 319,326 vehicles compared with 303,202 during September
1987. The boost in U.S.-made trucks apparently came at the expense
of foreign truck makers.
   Sales of light trucks made overseas slipped 27.4 percent last
month compared with the same month last year.
   ``Clearly there are some sales that are showing up as truck
sales that used to be car sales,'' Laughlin said. ``Minivans are in
particular a replacement for station wagons.
   ``At the same time, there seems to be a growing consumer trend
to sport utility vehicles in much the same way there was toward
muscle cars in the '60s and '70s,'' he added.
   Foreign and domestic automakers said they sold 792,295 cars last
month, a 8.1 percent decrease from the 862,391 cars sold during
September of last year.
   General Motors Corp. showed the largest car sales decline in
late September, dropping 15 percent to 116,028 cars this year
compared with 136,483 during the same period last year. Ford Motor
Co.'s late September sales fell to 70,813 cars, down 14.3 percent
from 82,606 during the period last year.
   Chrysler Corp. showed the smallest late-September decline,
falling 4.5 percent to 33,314 cars this year compared with 34,898
last year.
   For the calendar year, Chrysler has reported an 11.6 percent
sales increase compared to the first nine months of last year.
During that same time, Ford's sales have risen 7.2 percent and GM's
have fallen 0.7 percent.
   But Sudol said the Chrysler figures may be a little deceiving.
   ``In 1987, they had a lot of down time for plant retooling so
that makes it a little easier'' to show increased sales in 1988
compared to the year before.

<HEAD>Health Authorities Seeking to Check Spread of AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Central African country is using
everything from comic books to theater to make its population more
aware of AIDS, and the program seems to be working, officials said.
   Although the deadly, incurable disease is most common among male
homosexuals in the West, the incidence is high among heterosexuals
in Africa. Doctors disagree about the reasons.
   Dr. N'galy Bosenge, director of Zaire's national AIDS committee,
said Zaire is preparing its first major random survey of the AIDS
infection rate.
   In an interview Monday, N'galy said a pilot study may begin in
late October to determine whether enough blood samples can be
obtained to permit a representative survey.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, is caused by a
virus that attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
defenseless against infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their unborn offspring.
   Zaire began a national AIDS education program last year, using
comic books, popular music, theater and television.
   Until then, officials had been reluctant to talk with Western
journalists about the disease or publicize the danger among their
own people.
   Dennis Chandler of the U.S. Agency for International development
praised Zaire's education program and said: ``A survey found
knowledge of AIDS in the Kinshasa region was as high as that found
in the United States.''
   ``Condom sales have increased from virtually nil to 100,000
monthly,'' according to a survey in Kinshasa and a few other
regions, Chandler said.
   N'galy said Zaire had cooperated with scientists researching the
AIDS problem, but claims that the disease originated in Zaire and
descriptions of this country as the ``AIDS epicenter'' made
officials wary of publicity.
   ``When we first reported that from 6-8 percent of the people
surveyed in Kinshasa were sero-positive it was regarded as a
national catastrophe,'' he said.
   Authorities also hesitated because they lacked verifiable data.
N'galy said that explained why Zaire had reported only 300 cases to
the World Health Organization while health authorities were
convinced the total was many times that.
   The new random survey of 10,000 Kinshasa residents will seek to
determine the true AIDS rate, he said.
   Previous surveys have found rates ranging from 6-8 percent among
the staff of a Kinshasa hospital to 3-4 percent at a large factory
and a bank. N'galy said he could not explain the difference and the
rates could not be considered representative of the general
population, which he said probably was somewhere between.
   According to N'galy, a principal aim of the new study is ``to
evaluate the success of our aids education program. The most
important thing is to check the rate of AIDS infection. We are
confident that people understand the need for change, but it is a
long-term effort.''
   Current studies of pregnant women and blood donors suggest the
incidence is not rising among the general population because
comparisons with surveys taken several years ago found differences
statistically insignificant, N'galy said.
   He said a survey in one remote village indicated the AIDS
infection level remained under 1 percent and did not change in 10
years.
   Tests of prostitutes in Kinshasa, however, indicated an increase
in the infection rate from 27 percent to 40, N'galy said.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prison officer accused of
mistreating Irish Republican Army guerrillas was killed Tuesday by
a bomb that destroyed his car as he was driving through Belfast.
   Hours later, an estimated 500 pounds of explosives inside a car
blew up outside a building in Belfast used by the Inland Revenue
tax service, starting a fire and causing extensive damage but no
injuries, according to police.
   The IRA asserted responsibility for both bombings.
   Police said Brian Armour, 48, was killed when a bomb exploded in
his car as he drove near his home in mainly Protestant east
Belfast. An IRA statement said it was the second attempt to kill
the officer.
   Officials said Armour was vice chairman of the Prison Officers
Association, a professional group, and worked at the Maze prison
outside Belfast where dozens of IRA inmates are held.
   In a statement to the local news media, the IRA claimed Armour
had ``a central role in organizing and carrying out the systematic
torture and brutalization of hundreds of Republican prisoners''
during a period of Maze prison protests that included the deaths of
10 inmates in hunger strikes in 1981.
   It also said Armour had recently advocated harsh treatment of
IRA inmates at the Maze and at Crumlin Road jail in Belfast.
   The statement said IRA members planted a 2-pound charge of
plastic explosives in his car but it failed to explode. A second
packet of 1{ pounds of explosives then was placed in the car and it
exploded, according to the statement.
   A police spokesman said a telephoned warning gave security units
30 minutes to evacuate the area around the Inland Revenue building.
No casualties were reported, but the spokesman said an elderly
woman was treated for shock.
   Armour was the 81st person to be killed this year in Northern
Ireland's sectarian violence. The known death toll since the IRA
began its violent campaign in 1969 is 2,699.
   The IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland, a British
province where Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics 3-2, with the
predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   It was announced Tuesday that Sir John Hermon will retire in May
after a decade as chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
the province's police force. No successor has been named.
   During his tenure the 13,000-member constabulary supplanted
British army units as the province's main security force.
   British officials have said Hermon, 59, molded an effective
anti-terrorist force, but 85 percent of the constabulary's members
are Protestants and efforts to win support from Catholic leaders
have failed.

   The Soviet Union said Tuesday it has
dropped a demand that blocked agreement on a new forum for
negotiating reduced conventional military forces in Europe.
   Yuri B. Kashlev, chief Soviet delegate to the Helsinki review
conference, said in an interview that the Kremlin has agreed that
tactical nuclear weapons need not be among weapons included in new
talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Kashlev said the Soviets also have agreed not to make a
distinction between attack aircraft and air defense forces in the
written mandate for the new negotiations.
   ``We will make the difference in the talks, but we decided to
meet NATO halfway,'' Kashlev declared. He said agreement came in
conversations last week at the United Nations in New York between
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, and
counterparts from NATO countries.
   American officials said Moscow had not formally presented its
position in protracted bargaining for new talks among 23 nations
designed to replace the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction
negotiations, which have dragged on in Vienna without agreement for
nearly 15 years.
   Negotiations on the new forum are being conducted at the Vienna
conference, one of several held to review compliance with the 1975
Helsinki agreements on European security and cooperation signed by
the United States, Canada and all European nations except Albania.
   Such a forum cannot begin work until a mandate is agreed upon by
the Eastern and North Atlantic alliances, and until the 35 Helsinki
signatories produce a final document at the Vienna review session,
which began in November 1986.
   Also remaining to be settled is a formula for liaison with the
12 neutral or non-aligned nations that signed the Helsinki accords
but are not included in the arms negotiations.
   Kashlev predicted Tuesday: ``The mandate can be completed in the
next two to three weeks.''
   In order to produce a final document for the Vienna conference,
East and West must find mutually acceptable language on human
rights and economic copoperation, and agree on how many more review
meetings to hold.
   Western diplomats say a major problem is Soviet insistence on
holding a follow-up conference on human rights in Moscow.
   In Kashlev's view, refusing to do so would constitute ``a
boycott of Soviet democratization'' being carried out by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The United States and Britain argue that the Soviet Union still
does not meet criteria for the host of a human rights conference.
   ``It is difficult to think of a human rights conference in
Moscow while there are political prisoners in the Soviet Union,''
U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann said an interview.

   Sergei A. Losev, general director of the Soviet
Union's official news agency Tass, died suddenly at age 61, the
news agency announced Tuesday.
   Losev died Monday, Tass said without giving a cause of death.
   ``Soviet journalism has suffered a grievous loss,'' said an
obituary note signed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Losev had been in charge of the news agency since 1979.
   The Tass announcement praised Losev as a ``man of great
spiritual generosity'' who ``devoted all of his energy and
experience to the work given him by the party and government.
   ``His sense of purpose, industry and humaneness won him deep
respect from all who knew him,'' Tass said.
   Losev joined Tass in 1950 after graduating from the Moscow
Institute of International Relations, and worked as a correspondent
and bureau chief in the United States and Israel.
   In 1973 he became assistant director of Tass.
   Losev was a member of the Communist Party's Central Auditing
Commission, a delegate to the last two Communist Party congresses
and the June party conference. He had been a member of the Supreme
Soviet as well.

<TEXT>
   Lola Stuart-Hine, the woman who taught
U.S. Vice President George Bush to play tennis when he was growing
up, has died at age 91 in an English nursing home, staff at the
facility reported Tuesday.
   Mrs. Stuart-Hine died peacefully Monday night, said Julie
Holland, a supervisor at the Heritage nursing home at Sevenoaks, 22
miles southeast of London. Ms. Holland did not know the cause of
death.
   Ross de Havilland, Mrs. Stuart-Hine's nephew, confirmed the
death of his aunt Tuesday but refused to comment further.
   The elderly woman, a close friend of the Bush family, had lived
in New York City for many years before coming to the 30-patient
Heritage home two years ago, Ms. Holland said.
   After sending a telegram to Bush last month wishing him good
luck as the Republican Party presidential candidate, Mrs.
Stuart-Hine received a personal letter from him that was ``the last
real joy of her life,'' said her friend Gordon Macmillan.
   Mrs. Stuart-Hine was the last surviving child of the Victorian
British composer Leslie Stuart, whose anthem ``Soldiers of the
Queen'' sent British soldiers marching off to the 1899-1902 Boer
War in South Africa.
   Stuart's musical ``Flora Dora,'' which became a hit on Broadway
in the late 1890s, was based on his daughter Lola, 2 years old at
the time.
   She grew up to become a model for the Molyneux fashion house in
Paris during the 1920s and married American banker Francis
Worthington Hine.
   The couple settled near the Bush family estate at Kennebunkport,
Maine, where Mrs. Stuart-Hine taught the young George Bush how to
handle a tennis racket. He referred to her as ``Aunt Lola,''
although they were not related.
   The couple had no children. On her husband's side, Mrs.
Stuart-Hine was related to Hollywood stars Olivia de Havilland and

   The House on Tuesday narrowly sustained
President Reagan's veto of tightened textile and apparel import
curbs, bowing to claims that the legislation would mean price
increases amounting to a fresh tax on consumers.
   ``Stand up for consumers, stand up for America, support your
president's veto,'' declared Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., minutes
before the House voted 272-152 in favor of overriding the veto.
   The total in favor was 11 votes short of the support from
two-thirds of the lawmakers present and voting that textile
industry supporters had needed.
   Textile and apparel workers bused in from various points along
the East Coast watched grim-faced from the galleries as the House,
with at most two weeks before congressional adjournment, appeared
to end the battle for textile import legislation for the rest of
the year.
   Reagan, however, was pleased by the House vote, according to a
statement released Tuesday evening by the White House.
   ``With the defeat of this protectionist legislation, we remain
committed to expanding the business, investment and consumer
opportunities for Americans,'' the statement said.
   ``By sustaining the veto, the House has once again reaffirmed
America's commitment to the free market and free international
trade,'' Reagan added.
   The bill, designed to protect American industry against foreign
competition, would freeze 1988 textile and apparel imports at last
year's level and limit growth to 1 percent annually beginning in
January.
   It also would clamp a similar cap on nonrubber footwear imports,
with no provision for future increases.
   Countries that increased purchases of American farm goods would
get larger shares of the U.S. textile and apparel market. The bill
also would establish a pilot program under which the government
would auction off import licenses and it would create a special
quota for imported silk neckties.
   Waving American flags and holding up multicolored umbrellas,
textile and apparel workers rallied under murky skies on the
windswept steps of the Capitol at noon, chanting, ``Save our jobs,
save our jobs.''
   Some watched the debate from the galleries later and Rep. Ken
Gray, D-Ill., the presiding officer, warned them to be quiet when
they applauded some pro-override oratory. After that they looked on
in silence.
   ``I cry out for our country,'' said Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C.,
chief sponsor of the bill. He said free trade was leading the
nation down the same economic path that eroded the financial power
of the British Empire.
   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., one of the bill's fiercest critics,
contended, however, that it would prove costly to consumers.
   ``It imposes a tax on American consumers of about $20 billion a
year,'' he said.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, whose home-state shoe plants have
been hammered hard by imports, appealed to the House to ignore
``the ideological rot of an obsolete free-trade policy'' and enact
``this sensible trade bill.''
   A Democratic critic of the measure, Rep. Tom Downey of New York,
said that if the House were ``to do this by secret ballot there
would be no doubt about the outcome. To override the president's
veto makes no sense.''
   ``Open markets make everybody richer,'' he said.
   In vetoing the measure Sept. 28, Reagan said it represented
``protectionism at its worst,'' would raise prices, narrow consumer
choices and invite retaliation against American exports. Some of
the most prolific producers of textiles and apparel are among the
top customers of U.S. agriculture.
   Textile industry supporters say their goods are being squeezed
off store shelves by a flood of imported goods produced by Asian
textile mills and apparel plants. They point to a 17 percent
increase in imports in the 1980s and wide layoffs, including 29,000
lost last year.
   Textile industry earnings fell 12 percent in the first quarter
of this year, sponsors say.
   Critics, however, say the textile industry is flourishing,
largely because of a wave of automation over the last few years
that sharpened its competitive edge. They say that facelift, more
than overseas competition, is responsible for layoffs.
Manufacturers already are protected by 1,400 quotas covering 42
countries plus high tariffs.
   Reagan vetoed a similar measure in December 1985 and sponsors
were unable to muster the support they needed in the override
attempt in August 1986.
   The House approved the current bill, 263-156, a year ago and the
Senate approved it, 59-36, two weeks ago. The House voted, 248-150,
last week to accept Senate changes in the legislation and send it
to Reagan's desk.
   Joining the administration in its opposition to the measure were
an array of importers and retailers as well as industries wary of
trade protectionism lest it unleash retaliation against the goods
that they send overseas.
   Supporters included the textile, apparel and shoe industries and
the labor unions that represent their employees: the Amalgamated
Textile and Apparel Workers Union and the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union.
   Support for the measure cuts across partisan lines not only
within Congress but among rank-and-file supporters.
   Stella McGovern, an employee of a Philadelphia upholstery plant
for the last 12 years, arrived for the Capitol rally wearing
campaign buttons not only for the Dukakis-Bentsen Democratic
presidential ticket but for Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   ``I like Heinz and I also like (Republican Sen. Arlen)
Specter,'' she said. ``because he (Heinz) is for the people and he
votes for the trade legislation ... It's the bills he votes for.''

   Carbon monoxide that built up in a cargo ship's
hold killed two people Tuesday and overcame at least 14 others,
including fire and police rescue workers, officials said.
   Ship workers were using a gasoline-powered water pump to remove
seawater from the hold, but inadvertently let the pump fill the
hold with the deadly, odorless gas, said city fire spokeswoman
Nivia Boaz said.
   To squeeze into the hold through a two-foot opening, rescuers
had to remove their emergency breathing apparatus, said fire-rescue
Capt. Jim Tolbert.
   Stacey Taibel, 55, and Fajaido Alamacio, 30, crew members on the
Panamanian-registered Turrialda at the Port of Miami, suffered
cardiac arrest and died, said Jackson Memorial Hospital spokeswoman
Betty Baderman.
   Seven firefighters were taken to Jackson Memorial and six were
released, said Ms. Baderman. Firefighter Ronald Rickett, 47, was
listed in serious condition, as were two police officers, Arthur
Angelica, 34, and Tom Leis, 38.
   Crew members Emanuel Merjado, 27, and Roy Geer, 35, were in
critical condition at Jackson Memorial, she said.
   Three crew members, a Filipino and two Nicaraguans, were

   Hundreds of police swept through Arab
neighborhoods of the holy city Tuesday, arresting dozens of alleged
protest organizers and tax evaders, a police spokesman said.
   In the occupied territories, Arab hospital officials said
Israeli soldiers shot and wounded eight Palestinians. Protesters
blocked roads and stoned troops from nearby rooftops.
   Soldiers were posted at Al-Ittihad hospital in the West Bank
town of Nablus to guard a critically wounded Palestinian who was
shot after he attacked a soldier with a knife in the city's open
air market, the army said.
   Officials at Al-Ittihad said 100 soldiers were deployed in and
around the hospital, but an army spokeswoman said only a few were
standing guard.
   At least 280 Palestinians have been killed since a rebellion
began last Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million living in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief of staff, said Tuesday that
fewer Palestinians have been killed and more wounded since troops
began using plastic bullets in August. Egypt, the United States and
Britain have condemned Israel's use of the ammunition.
   Police raided Jerusalem's Abu Tor and Silwan districts after
anti-Israel disturbances, police spokesman Rafi Levy said. Officers
have used tear gas with greater frequency to disperse
stone-throwing crowds in several neighborhoods.
   Last week, police shot and killed 19-year-old Jamal Mattar
during a riot in the Jabal Mukabar district. He was the first
Palestinian killed in 10 months of the uprising.
   Officials at Al-Ittihad Hospital said Tuesday that Yihyeh
Mabruka, 21, was in critical condition with bullet and knife wounds
in the abdomen and chest.
   The military spokeswoman said Mabruka was wanted by the army but
did not say why. Soldiers on patrol in the Nablus market spotted
Mabruka and tried to arrest him but the Palestinian pulled a knife
and lunged at the patrol leader before being shot, she said.

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen received a Texas send-off from cheering supporters in
front of the state capitol and headed Tuesday for his Omaha
showdown with Republican Dan Quayle.
   ``Tomorrow is a big day for us, and a big day for this
campaign,'' Bentsen told the crowd of about 1,500 people at the
Austin rally. ``And I can't think of a greater way to start it than
surrounded by friends here on the capitol steps of Texas,'' he said.
   ``I have 90 minutes to explain to America why Mike Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen should lead this country,'' he said, ``ninety minutes
to describe our vision of America, to tell the voters how Lloyd
Bentsen and Mike Dukakis plan to keep our economy and our military
number one.''
   Blasting the Republicans for trying ``time and time again'' to
cut Social Security, he also touched on Democratic themes of
education and health and on what he said was ``proven and tested
leadership.''
   ``George Bush and Dan Quayle hear no questions and offer no
answers,'' he said. ``They tell us to lower our sites, to live on
our past, rest on our laurels.''
   The Texas senator left the scene beneath a cloud of red and
white balloons and with the speakers shouting the theme from the
old television show ``Rawhide.''
   Before heading for Nebraska, Bentsen spent most of Tuesday in an
Austin hotel drilling for Wednesday night's vice presidential
debate with informal run-throughs and private study aimed at
getting ready for a prime-time audience.
   Susan Estrich, Michael Dukakis' campaign manager who was helping
Bentsen in his final preparations, said of the preparattions:
``We're not teaching him new positions on issues. ... I think
that's what the Quayle people have to do.
   ``You certainly don't have to teach him scripts on the issues,
which I assume they are doing on the other side.''
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, played Quayle in mock debates on
Monday. He injected some humor into the session by leaving the
room, returning in a Ronald Reagan mask and wishing Bentsen luck
from a 3-by-5 card, said campaign spokeswoman Ellen Moskowitz.
   Eckart had to return to Washington on Monday night for a vote in
the House, and Mike McCurry, Bentsen's campaign press secretary,
was playing Quayle on Tuesday.
   McCurry said Bentsen was looking for ``the best way of making a
point memorable or punchy,'' but was having trouble with the time
limits.
   ``The red light goes off frequently,'' he said.
   ``It's all a matter of getting ready to present it in two-minute
answers and one-minute rebuttals,'' Estrich said. ``Our counsel to
him has been to be himself.''
   Some of Dukakis' top advisers were helping Bentsen prepare,
including Estrich and media adviser Tom Donilon. Campaign chairman
Paul Brountas planned to meet Bentsen in Omaha, Moskowitz said.
   The Texas senator also will have a crowd of Capitol Hill
colleagues supporting him in Omaha.
   The Democratic campaign has chartered a jet from Washington to
fly in about 40 members of Congress, including many of his Senate
friends. Some of them will also work afterward to get out the
Democratic viewpoint, or ``spin,'' on the results of the 90-minute
debate, Moskowitz said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge bypassed a defiant Yonkers City
Council Tuesday and designated a site for low-income housing to
replace one the Roman Catholic Church did not want to give up.
   Should the council fail to come up with an alternative by Oct.
12, and should the new location pass muster by the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development, the judge ordered the city to
acquire it ``under penalty of contempt.''
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand previously used a contempt
order to force the Council to endorse a plan to build 800 units of
affordable housing throughout the state's fourth-largest city. He
imposed fines that doubled daily until reaching $1 million,
confronting the city with layoffs and cutbacks.
   Despite the endorsement vote, a council majority still opposes
the 800 units as well as 200 units of low-income housing in a
predominantly white area. Sand intended the construction as a
remedy to his 1985 finding that the city intentionally segregated
housing and schools for 40 years.
   ``Isn't it a fact that the Council assumes no responsibility,
but to take a purely negative position to be against whatever it is
the parties or court proposes?'' Sand repeatedly asked city
attorney Michael Sculnick at a hearing Tuesday.
   Sculnick replied that there was neither a sufficient majority on
the Council to designate a site nor was there a desire to
participate in choosing an alternative site for 22 units of
low-income housing to replace property located on St. Joseph's
Seminary.
   ``It is hypocritical for the city to proclaim its desire not to
use the seminary site against the wishes of the archdiocese while
refusing to take any positive action that would obviate the
problem,'' Sand said.
   Sand gave the city a week to choose alternative sites and
ordered HUD to do a preliminary review of any property the Council
proposes to determine its suitability.
   A very preliminary review of the site designated by Sand
indicated it was feasible, said John Herald, HUD's attorney.
   Sand did not immediately threaten the City Council with contempt
for failing to choose an alternative site. But he openly expressed
anger as he has not done through eight years of the case.
   ``What perhaps is the most distressing and offensive aspect of
the position taken by the city is its willingness to use the
seminary site and the church-state issue as a ploy to defeat or
indefinitely delay the fulfillment of the city's obligation'' to
build affordable housing, Sand said.
   The church challenged condemnation of its property, and a
federal appeals panel told Sand to hold a hearing to determine
whether there were other sites. The Council argued that until the
church-state issue was resolved, it would do nothing to cooperate
with the desegregation order. It said if another site were chosen
to replace the seminary site, that would invalidate the whole plan
it had agreed to.
   The site designated by Sand had been proposed by Yonkers Mayor
Nicholas Wasicsko at a City Council meeting last week, but the
council refused to vote on it. After court, Wasicsko said there was
a chance the Council would choose another site, but he wasn't
optimistic.

   Police officers in Lawrence voted Tuesday
afternoon to endorse Vice President George Bush's Republican
campaign for the presidency.
   The vote, taken at the Lawrence police station among members of
the police union, was 73 for Bush, 5 for Democratic presidential
nominee Michael S. Dukakis and 6 with no preference, said Officer
Charles Carroll, the union steward.
   Carroll said the police sentiment against Gov. Dukakis involves
his stance on crime, his opposition to the death penalty and
criticism of the state furlough program for convicts.
   Last month, police officers in Boston and in Springfield
endorsed Bush for president.
   Lawrence is the city where Willie Horton killed Joey Fournier,
17, and was convicted of first-degree murder.
   While serving his sentence, Horton escaped while on a furlough
from state prison. Later, he was arrested and convicted in Maryland
on charges of raping a woman and terrorizing her and her finance.
   Public outcry over the Horton case prompted Massachusetts
lawmakers to ban furloughs for inmates convicted of first-degree
murder.

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police sealed off sections of
Cape Town Tuesday, blocking streets with armored vehicles while
detectives searched pedestrians and vehicles in a ``street-freeze''
operation.
   A policeman using a loudspeaker told pedestrians the action was
routine and that officers were searching for suspicious parcels.
   Authorities began street-freeze operations following an increase
in the number of bombings in white-ruled South Africa.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _A policeman fatally shot a black worker who allegedly attacked
another man with a screwdriver outside the luxury Sun Hotel in
Johannesburg. Police identified the slain man as John Mhkize and
said he was a member of the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union that
has been on strike at the hotel.
   _At the United Nations in New York, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz criticized congressionally imposed sanctions against South
Africa, saying the main victims have been black businesses and
workers. He spoke to representatives of the Organization of African
Unity attending the General Assembly session.
   Four bombings in South Africa over the past four days prompted
police to respond with the street-freeze plan. Last month bombings
averaged about one a day.
   The government has blamed most of the bombings on the outlawed
African National Congress, saying the black guerrilla organization
is trying to disrupt the October 26 municipal elections.
   Government opponents have noted some of the bombing targets were
organizations or individuals opposed to the policy of apartheid and
bombs have exploded in areas frequented only by blacks. They said
that indicated white vigilantes or secret units of the security
forces might be responsible.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Police gave few details about Mhkize's death. They said he was
shot after he attacked a man near the entrance of the hotel and
then went into the lobby.
   About 3,000 employees of the Southern Sun hotel chain are
striking to protest the dismissal of some workers who did not show
up for work on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 riots in the
black township of Soweto. Many blacks observe June 16 as a memorial
holiday.
   The Southern Sun management began a lock-out of striking workers
on Monday and said they would be dismissed on Friday if they did
not return to work.
   Shultz, in his address to the OAU delegates, repeated his stand
that mandatory sanctions deprive the United States of the leverage
it needs to press for an end to South Africa's apartheid system.
   He said American businessmen forced to sell their holdings in
South Africa have done so, at bargain prices, to the ``South
African industrial and financial elite,'' and that is the ``wrong
signal'' for the United States to be sending.
   ``We believe that a more fruitful approach is to help the
victims of apartheid build their bargaining power through
assistance for education, economic opportunities and community
development for South Africans,'' Shultz said.
   The secretary said the political outlook for South Africa is not
encouraging.
   ``We remain deeply concerned that unless the accelerating cycle
of violence _ practiced by both the government and its opponents _
is stopped, South Africa will continue its descent into a siege
mentality and garrison state in which all South Africans become
losers,'' he said.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson urged Cleveland's
heavily Democratic black community Tuesday night to recognize
differences between Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis and support the Democratic presidential ticket.
   Jackson's appearance at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Cleveland
came the same day Dukakis stopped in Toledo to tour a Jeep plant.
   ``We tend to look at these two candidates and we can't see much
of a difference,'' Jackson told about 300 people at a voter
registration rally in the church. ``I've seen them both up close
and, take my word for it, there is a difference. When Dukakis
stands for a health plan for the common people, he has earned your
vote.''
   He said Bush ``stands against civil liberties, civil rights,
workers' rights and women's rights. He is a threat to our future.''
   After his remarks, he left the church and told reporters that he
is patched up any difference he had with the Dukakis campaign. The
former Democratic presidential candidate, who was Dukakis' chief
rival in the spring primaries, said his job now is ``to be
inspirational and to register new voters.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political killings, torture and detention without
trial are widespread in Asia amid civil and ethnic conflicts in
large parts of the continent, Amnesty International said Wednesday.
   In its annual report on a global survey, the organization cited
24 Asian countries for alleged human rights violations in 1987.
   It said Soviet and Afghan troops, often in reprisal attacks
against anti-communist rebels, killed dozens of unarmed civilians
in Afghanistan. Unlawful killings by government forces also were
reported in the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India.
   The report from the London-based international human rights
group included these allegations:
   In the Philippines, security forces or government-backed
vigilante groups killed more than 100 left-wing political
activists, members of labor unions and peasant organizations.
   Several thousand political detainees were held in India without
charge or trial under anti-terrorist laws, and a government inquiry
into the massacre of scores of unarmed Moslems produced no results.
   There were continued killings in Sri Lanka of Tamil civilians,
often in reprisal for attacks by militant Tamil groups fighting for
a separate state.
   Between 1983 and the end of 1987 more than 680 Tamils
disappeared in Sri Lanka and it is believed many were shot or
tortured to death by security forces. Most Tamils are Hindus and
claim discrimination by Sri Lanka's Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   Amnesty International said governments used a variety of methods
to suppress criticism.
   It said Singapore and Malaysia imposed press laws allowing the
government absolute authority to restrict any publication deemed to
have engaged in ``domestic politics'' or to have ``alarmed public
opinion.''
   In South Korea it is against the law to give information to
foreigners that officials judge could ``insult or slander the
state,'' the report said.
   It also said a majority of Asian countries carried out
court-imposed executions. Amnesty International opposes the death
sentence as inhumane punishment.
   The report said that in China more than 200 convicted criminals
were put to death for offenses ranging from murder and rape to drug
smuggling, theft and ``showing pornographic movies.'' But that
figure represents ``only a fraction of the total number of death
sentences and executions,'' it said.
   At least 70 people were sentenced to death in Pakistan ``but the
real total may have been considerably higher,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Kentucky County Where 27 Died On Bus Votes On Future Of Alcohol</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with vote totals; picks up at
dash.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters decided Tuesday to let the sale of
alcohol continue in the county where a church bus crash blamed on a
drunken driver killed 27 people, most of them children.
   The voter turnout was one of the highest ever recorded in the
northern Kentucky's Carroll County, with groups on both sides of
the issue providing rides to the polls for voters.
   The referendum was made up of two votes _ one on whether to ban
the sale of alcohol in Carroll County and a separate vote for
Carollton; one could be dry and the other wet.
   In Carroll County, 1,173 voted for the status quo, while 750
voted against it. In the city of Carrollton, 1,211 voted to retain
legal liquor sales, while 450 voted to ban them.
   Chuck Webster, leader of Citizens for the Legal Sale of Alcohol,
said the bus crash influenced some people to vote on the side of
the wets.
   ``A lot of people took it personally. They felt by voting no, it
would be accepting some responsibility for the bus crash,'' Webster
said.
   Trudy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for the pro-dry organization
Citizens for a Better Life, said the group accomplished its goal of
letting the people decide.
   ``We did accomplish what we set out to do. We gave the people
the chance to vote,'' she said. ``I'm sorry we didn't win, but we
gave the people the opportunity to say what they wanted.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Debbie Roeder, a member of Citizens for a
Better Life, said the vote ``has been wanted for many years. The
bus crash probably did prompt people into action, whereas before
they thought, `Whats the sense?' ''

   The issue has burned in the county since May 14, when a pickup
truck driven by Larry Mahoney collided head-on with a church bus on
Interstate 71. Twenty-four of the victims of the fiery crash were
children.
   Authorities said Mahoney was drunk at the time. He has been
charged with murder, drunken driving and other counts.
   Ms. Roeder said opponents of alcohol elsewhere had a keen
interest in the results of the Carrollton voting.
   ``If a little town the size of Carrollton that has as many
liquor establishments as it's got can actually vote it dry, it's
like `Hey, maybe we can do this,''' she said.
   There are 37 places in the county selling beer, including gas
stations and convenience stores, according to the Carroll County
Chamber of Commerce.
   The county has about 9,200 residents, including Carrollton's
population of about 3,900.
   ``This vote has been wanted for many years,'' said Ms. Roeder.
``The bus crash probably did prompt people into action, whereas
before they thought: `What's the sense?'''
   ``The problem here is ... the majority of drinkers have been
very irresponsible,'' she said.
   At the opposite extreme, the ``wets'' led by Citizens for the
Legal Sale of Alcoholic Beverages argued that banning alcohol sales
would be both a financial and moral burden.
   ``I voted wet, I don't mind telling you. I firmly believe in it.
My 88-year-old mother believes in it,'' said Louise Fitzpatrick,
54. ``There would be a lot of bootleggers and more accidents'' if
liquor were banned.
   The dry forces estimated they spent less than $1,000 on
newspaper advertisements but no radio commercials.
   The wet forces spent about $6,000 on an extensive newspaper and
radio campaign.
   The Carroll County clerk's office said 520 new voters had been
registered, boosting the total eligible for the referendum to
6,039, the largest number of registered voters in a decade.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis split the
lead in a pair of Pennsylvania polls, but the margins of error
closed the gap in both surveys.
   A survey of likely voters for the Philadelphia Daily News and
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette showed Bush leading Dukakis 48 percent
to 42 percent. The sampling error among those 595 people questioned
last Friday and Saturday was plus or minus 4 points, however.
   A survey of likely voters for Philadelphia television station
WCAU-TV gave Dukakis the lead _ 46 percent to 45 percent _ with 9
percent undecided.
   But the sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points
meant neither candidate had a clear lead in the battle for
Pennsylvania's 25 electoral votes.
   The WCAU poll surveyed 837 registered voters statewide by
telephone from last Thursday through Saturday.

<HEAD>Iraq Insists Shatt-al-Arab, Persian Gulf Must Be Navigable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi foreign minister said Tuesday
that the latest Iran-Iraq peace talks have gone well but insisted
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway and Persian Gulf must be navigable if
negotiations are to progress.
   The talks that ran Aug. 25 to Sept. 13 in Geneva and shifted to
New York last weekend.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq told the 43rd General
Assembly that Iran ``accepted the (Security Council's peace)
resolution only because of a crushing military defeat and in the
context of a struggle for power inside Iran.''
   He said this made Baghdad suspicious of Iran's motives as to
whether Iran sincerely wanted a lasting peace treaty with Iraq.
   ``This suspicious position ... was followed by ... (the Iranian
delegation's) insistence on provisions which impose a de facto arms
embargo on Iraq at sea,'' said Aziz, referring to Iran's searches
of neutral ships in the gulf for war cargo bound for Iraq.
   Iraq insists the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms part of the
two countries' southern border, must be cleared of sunken ships and
silt accumulated during the eight-year war.
   ``Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only outlet to the high seas,'' said
Aziz.
   He denied this was a precondition, saying the demand was spelled
out to the Security Council throughout proceedings that led to
peace talks opening in Geneva on Aug. 25. A U.N.-monitored
cease-fire went into effect on Aug. 20.
   Baghdad says Iran's policy of searching ships violates the
cease-fire, which calls for a halt to all military actions on air,
sea and land.
   Iran insists it has the right as a nation at war to search the
ships and says peace talks should be limited to the issues in
Resolution 598, with no extraneous concerns such as Shatt-al-Arab.
   Aziz met with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar before
addressing the General Assembly. He said both hope that a date will
be decided soon on resuming peace talks in Geneva.
   Asked if Perez de Cuellar introduced new proposals, he answered:
``We are discussing all possible ideas ... on how to make further
progress, and the discussions went well with his excellency.''
   Last Saturday, Aziz met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati for direct peace talks, but the session soon shifted to
indirect talks, with the secretary-general and his special
mediator, Swedish U.N. Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson.
   On Friday and Monday, Aziz and Velayati met separately with the
secretary-general, and their aides met Monday.
   From the statements made by both delegations during the weekend
and from Aziz's speech Tuesday, no indication emerged of progress
on the major issues.

<HEAD>Brazil to Enact New Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney told the nation
Tuesday night that the enactment of a new constitution will
complete Brazil's transition to democracy.
   The constitution is to be adopted Wednesday, replacing
authoritarian laws handed down 20 years ago by the military chiefs
who ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985.
   In a nationwide television address, Sarney said: ``This is a
historic date for our country. The enactment of the new
constitution brings us to the end of a long path .... My mission of
helping the country through its transition to democracy is
fulfilled.''
   But Brazilians don't know how their life will be affected by the
new charter, a 245-article document that touches on issues ranging
from interest rates to mining rights and land reform.
   Sarney had fought some measures included in the charter, but he
said Tuesday he would be ``the constitution's greatest servant.''
   The president of the Constituent Assembly, Rep. Ulysses
Guimaraes, said the constitution ``will consolidate a
representative and participatory democracy.'' The 559-member,
two-chamber Congress that was elected in 1986 worked for 19 months
as a Constituent Assembly to produce the charter.
   It decentralizes the government's power, abolishes the
president's power to impose laws by decree, ends censorship, makes
torture a crime and broadens workers' rights to unionize and strike.
   It also regulates education, divorce, the rights of native
Indians and the activities of oil and mining companies.
   Foreign-owned mining companies will have four years to hand over
majority control to permanent residents of Brazil while domestic
companies will receive unspecified ``privileges'' from the
government. Those measures were seen as a victory for leftists.
   But right-wing members of Congress scored with land-reform
provisions that make ``productive land'' not subject to
expropriation.
   One of the most controversial articles limits ``real'' interest
rates to 12 percent a year. But it doesn't specify what ``real''
interest rates are and it has been suggested another law will be
needed to make the limit effective.
   Some legislators say the real interest is above the inflation
rate, which the government has said will register 800 percent this
year. Many banks and credit associations now charge more than 1,000
percent interest.
   Guimaraes, considered the architect of the constitution, said
Monday the charter would be respected by all, including the armed
forces.
   ``The military period left deep marks,'' he said. ``There is an
awareness that the regime is good, and from the armed forces we
have heard only words of support and confidence in the stability of
democracy.''

<TEXT>
   Perry Como says he dislikes the
million-selling ``awful novelty songs'' that made him a success,
but concert audiences still want to hear them.
   ``They said you sing it and I did it,'' Como said of the
producers of songs like ``Papa Love Mambo,'' ``Chiwawa, Chiwawa,
Chiwaba'' and ``Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes.''
   `` `A Hubba-Hubba-Hubba' was another sick one and another gold
record,'' said Como, 76, who performs this week at Bally's Grand
Hotel and Casino.
   ``I still do them onstage once in a while because the audience
wants it, but I say `yech' afterwards.''
   Como's got his first taste of bad songs when he sang with Ted
Weems' big band, featuring whistler Elmo Tanner, in the 1930s and
1940s.
   ``Me and Sinatra and all the rest of the singers used to talk
about all the crap we had to sing,'' Como said. ``Once in awhile we
had songs the bandleaders would force on us. And if I didn't sing
it, Elmo would whistle it.''

<HEAD>Girl Awarded $7.2 Million in Negligence Suit Against Health Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old girl was awarded more than $7
million by a jury that concluded she suffered brain damage,
cerebral palsy and blindness because of city hospital negligence
around the time of her birth.
   ``What made this case so tragic was the fact that the hospital
had several opportunities to save the child from her dreadful fate,
but it failed so obviously and miserably,'' Thomas A. Moore, the
lawyer for the child's family, said.
   Moore said Bellevue Hospital and its physicians made mistakes
and misdiagnoses in caring for the girl's mother, Ora Stewart.
   Two days before her child was born, Ms. Stewart visited the
hospital's emergency room complaining of a vaginal discharge, but
was sent home, the lawyer said. The next morning she returned to
Bellevue with labor pains five minutes apart, but again was sent
home, he said.
   Ms. Stewart gave birth to the child, Shavon Skinner, the
following day in her apartment. Because of complications, the
newborn had trouble breathing and, after she was rushed to
Bellevue, went untreated for more than 24 hours even though she was
having seizures, the lawyer maintained.
   Fred Winters, a spokesman for the city Health and Hospitals
Corp., said the agency had not yet closely examined the jury's
finding, but there appeared to be grounds for an appeal and ``the
award may be excessive.''
   After deliberating for three days, the Manhattan state Supreme
Court jury awarded $4.945 million for medical expenses and other
care for Shavon Skinner; $750,000 for her pain and suffering; and
$1.5 million for Shavon's loss of enjoyment of life, for a total
award of $7.195 million, Moore said.
   During her pregnancy, Ms. Stewart was an employee of the city
Department of Social Services, which entitled her to free medical
care and hospitalization in a city hospital, Moore said.
   Ms. Stewart received regular prenatal care at a city clinic. She
was 29 years old when Shavon was born and was considered a
``high-risk patient'' because of hypertension and an overweight
problem, Moore said.
   Since the girl's birth, Ms. Stewart has been on an extended
leave of absence to take care of Shavon, the lawyer said.
   The negligence suit was filed against the city in 1980, several
months after Shavon's birth, Moore said.

<TEXT>
   ``Frank's Place,'' has been canceled, but the
restaurant that inspired it is still cooking.
   ``That's sad,'' Chef Austin Leslie, owner of Chez Helene, said
Tuesday after learning that the critically acclaimed CBS comedy had
been canceled. ``It won't hurt us though, I'm still a star around
here.''
   Leslie said the on again-off again series provided him with more
fun than customers or fame. ``It did well for me and we had some
good times over it, but I was on a roll before it and I'm still on
a roll,'' he said.
   Chez Helene's Creole, soul, French, and Cajun food has appealed
to black and white New Orleanians for a long time, but Leslie said
he did see an increase in tourists because of the television show.
   ``I think it showed some people from around the United States
that they could come into the black community and enjoy
themselves,'' he said. ``It also gave the taxi drivers another
place to tell people about. They would tell tourists to try the
real Frank's Place,'' he said.
   Leslie said he never tried to copy the show that had copied him.
   ``Some people said, `why don't you change the name of the
restaurant?' But I didn't. I did use the Frank's Place theme during
the (Republican National) convention, but we're still the same as
we ever were,'' he said.
   Frank's Place brought more than excitement to Chez Helene,
however. Leslie said star Tim Reid visited the restaurant several
times after his original scouting trip when it was selected as a
model for the fictional restaurant.
   ``He came in a couple of more times including the time they shot
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous here. And, Hugh Wilson, the
producer brought all the writers in after carnival. He presented me
with a jacket,'' he said.
   Leslie said news of the cancellation by CBS surprised him since
everyone he talked to said they liked the show. ``They said they
liked to watch it but could never find it because the network moved
it around so much,'' he said.
   Chez Helene, which has been in operation since 1942, will
continue to dish out everything from fried chicken to gumbo, he
said.
   ``I'm just glad I kept my head through it all. Glad I kept my
perspective. It didn't put me on the map, I was already on the map.
It made us a little bit more famous, but I always thought we'd have
a long run right here in New Orleans,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Submariner Gets Four-Plus Years Confinement For Mishandling
Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy submariner convicted by court-martial of
mishandling secret photographs and documents was sentenced Tuesday
to four years confinement and kicked out of the Navy, officials
said.
   Chief Petty Officer David Fleming, an 18-year Navy veteran, also
was reduced to the lowest possible rank before being given a bad
conduct discharge, said Lt. Sonja Headley, a spokeswoman at the
Navy's submarine base on Point Loma.
   Fleming, 35, had faced up to 16 years in prison after being
found guilty Monday by a six-member court-martial board of
mishandling 16 secret photographs and documents by keeping them at
his home. He was photography chief aboard the submarine La Jolla at
the time of the offenses.
   After a four-day trial in a high-security Point Loma courtroom,
he also was found guilty of stealing six training documents,
soliciting his wife to destroy evidence and dereliction of duty.
   Fleming contended that cramped quarters aboard the San
Diego-based La Jolla led him to develop photographs at home. He
argued that his behavior was no different from other submariners
with similar responsibilities.
   ``I am being prosecuted under the letter of the law for obeying
the spirit of the law,'' Fleming said after the guilty verdicts
Monday.
   Fleming was convicted under espionage statutes that allege he
knew keeping the photos could damage national security. No evidence
of such damage was offered in court, sources told The San Diego
Union.
   Fleming and several other chief petty officers who testified for
the defense said security procedures on the La Jolla were sloppy,
especially when the submarine was deployed.
   Fleming originally was charged with mishandling 28 photographs.
He earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of mishandling classified
documents and the theft of the same four documents, which were
training manuals.
   Six counts of mishandling secrets were dropped at the beginning
of the trial. Fleming was found innocent on two counts of
mishandling classified documents and innocent on one count of
stealing a secret document.

   A man has been charged with
setting a 12,000-acre wildfire that continues to burn in the San
Bernardino Mountains and is under investigation in 23 other arson
blazes, officials announced Tuesday.
   James Lonczak, 41, of Covina was charged Monday in Los Angeles
federal court with setting the Sept. 28 fire in the San Bernardino
Mountains that has consumed 12,000 acres and cost $2 million to
fight, prosecutors said.
   An affidavit filed with the criminal complaint states Lonczak is
also under investigation for allegedly setting 23 other arson
wildfires, said Mary McMenimen, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's
Office.
   Lonczak pleaded innocent to the charge at arraignment Monday and
is being held without bail pending an Oct. 18 hearing, she said.
   Mary Bethke, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Forest Service, said
Sunday's arrest of Lonczak was the result of a three-month
investigation by the agency and the California Department of
Forestry
   The fire has been contained, but fire officials said they don't
expect to extinguish the blaze until Thursday, said U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman Lindsay Maierhofer.
   Flames from the fire were fanned last week by gusty Santa Ana
winds of up to 60 mph. The fire closed nearby Interstate 15 for a
time and forced hundreds of people to evacuate homes.
   One ranch home and a shed were destroyed. Property losses
totaled about $250,000, officials said.
   Cost of battling the fire was estimated at nearly $2 million,
Ms. Maierhofer said.

<HEAD>New Government Installed, Promises Lower Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Democratic Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson installed his new government Tuesday, pledging lower
taxes, six weeks' annual vacation for workers and a streamlined
national defense.
   His policy speech to Parliament expanded on his campaign themes
for last month's election, in which his party retained office as a
minority government.
   The Social Democrats have led Sweden for 50 of the last 56
years. They took 156 of the 379 seats in Parliament and govern with
the tacit support of the Communist Party, which holds 21 seats.
   Carlsson said every worker, male or female, will be entitled to
double the current amount of parental leave by 1991, and may take
18 months off work with full pay.
   New legislation will guarantee everyone an extra week off for a
total of six weeks annual vacation, a privilege now enjoyed only by
workers over 40 years of age.
   Carlsson, who inherited the premiership after Olof Palme's 1986
assassination, introduced a largely unchanged, 21-member Cabinet.
One addition was Laila Freivalds, 46, a Latvian-born woman who
becomes justice minister.
   Carlsson promised to introduce a bill to lower the tax rate next
year by 3 percent, easing a situation which discourages overtime
and slows the national growth rate.
   The top tax bracket would drop to 72 percent. An average Swede
with a salary of $23,000 will lose 47 percent of his paycheck to
taxes instead of half of it, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
   ``Lack of workers and the low level of saving is limiting
growth, pushing up prices and costs,'' Carlsson said. ``Specific
measures ... will be implemented to increase saving and make better
use of people's will to work.''
   Corporate taxes and the 23.5 percent value added tax _ a form of
indirect sales tax _ will be reviewed, he said.
   The prime minister moved to defuse criticism from his armed
forces commander and the rightwing opposition that the military
lacked funds to carry out government defense strategy.
   ``The army will be reformed and made more efficient,'' he said
without elaboration. ``The policy of neutrality is supported by a
strong defense to protect our independence.''

<TEXT>
   A wealthy financier and a daughter
of the late actor John Wayne were tied up and beaten in a daytime
attack by two men, and police on Tuesday said no clear motive for
the attack had been determined.
   Roger Luby, 52, and Aissa Wayne, 32, were attacked Monday
morning by two men who followed them into Luby's mansion.
   ``It looks like she was in the wrong place at the wrong time,''
said Detective Sgt. Mike Jackson. ``It was meant as a message to
him. As of now, we don't know what that message is.''
   Ms. Wayne told The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that one of the
attackers said: ``You're messing with the wrong guy. Next time
we'll kill you.''
   The attackers tied up Luby and Ms. Wayne, the eldest daughter of
the late actor and Pilar Wayne.
   ``They grabbed her hair and beat her face against the
concrete,'' said Mrs. Wayne. ``Imagine the horror of somebody
telling you, `I'm gonna kill you if you say one word.' ''
   The assailant tried to cut Luby's right Achilles' tendon, but
failed to slice through it, police spokesman Greg Armstrong said.
Luby is a tennis player, which may be why the attacker tried to cut
his tendon, Jackson said.
   Nothing was stolen during the attack, Jackson said. ``Obviously,
somebody hired these guys,'' Jackson said. ``They went in, did
their thing and got out.''
   Ms. Wayne and Luby are going through divorces.
   Luby also is reportedly involved in real estate litigation and
bankruptcy proceedings involving his purchase of the Broadway
Department Store in Los Angeles.
   Luby declined to discuss the attack.
   ``As of now I'm all right, but on advice of counsel I can't say
anything,'' he said Tuesday.

   A 28-year-old man who hijacked a
Brazilian jet with 100 people aboard last week and later was
wounded by police gunfire died Tuesday after a five-hour police
interrogation, hospital officials said.
   Raimundo Conceicao, whom officials described as a ``psychopath''
shortly after the piracy, died of kidney failure, according to a
medical report released by Santa Genoveva Hospital in Goiania, 850
miles northwest of Rio.
   On Sept. 29, Conceicao burst into the cockpit of a Brazilian
airliner on a flight from the Western Amazon regions to Rio and
demanded that the plane fly to the federal capital of Brasilia. He
reportedly told negotiators he wanted to crash the plane into a
government building to ``settle accounts'' with the government
because of what he called its recessive economic policies.
   The plane was forced to land 125 miles southwest of Brasilia in
Goiania, where Conceicao shot and killed the co-pilot and wounded
two other people before being shot by police as he prepared to
change planes.
   He underwent surgery the same day to stop internal bleeding
caused by the bullet wounds.
   On Sunday, police questioned Conceicao intensely for five hours
about the hijacking. Late Monday afternoon, he was rushed to the
intensive care unit with soaring blood pressure.
   Conceicao's condition had been improving, and the medical report
said the cause of the sudden deterioration in his condition were
not known.
   A hospital doctor, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said, however, that the upward surge in blood pressure
could have been caused by a build-up of intestinal gases during the
lengthy interrogation.
   Doctors refused to let police talk to Conceicao on Monday,
saying his health had deteriorated. The contents of Conceicao's
police deposition were not made public.
   On Monday, government officials announced that passengers at
major Brazilian airports now will have their baggage checked before
boarding domestic flights. Previously, only those boarding
international flights were subject to police checks.

   A blackout blamed on the bombing of power
pylons hit the capital and other areas in a 1,300 -mile stretch of
Chile Tuesday night, the eve of a referendum on right-wing Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's presidency.
   At least eight loud explosions were heard in the capital city of
Santiago moments after the outage hit at 10:30 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT),
but police spokesman Luis Retamal said no immediate reports came in
of damage or injuries.
   The indication was that the later explosions may have been
caused by explosives intended to produce noise but do little damage.
   Retamal, in an interview broadcast by Radio Mineria of Santiago,
said he could not confirm the cause of the blackout. But police
sources said terrorist bombs toppled at least three power
transmission towers.
   Cities from Tal Tal, 690 miles north of Santiago, to Puerto
Montt, 650 miles to the south, were hit by the outage, authorities
said. Some communities in between were unaffected or suffered only
a flickering of lights. In some sectors of Santiago power was
restored in a half hour. Other areas remained without power an hour
later.
   A similar blackout struck Chile Saturday night and also was
accompanied by explosions that caused no apparent damage or
injuriees. The government blamed that outage on bombing of three
power towers by leftist terrorists, even though Chile's small
leftist urban guerrilla groups have declared a unilateral ``truce''
until after the referendum.
   Voters declare on Wednesday whether they want Pinochet as
president for eight more years, and his opponents predict the
decision will be no. Authorities say they will keep strict order.
   Alberto Cardemil, an Interior Ministry undersecretary, dismissed
fears expressed by the political opposition and Roman Catholic
Church officials of violence by Pinochet supporters on election day.
   He accused the opposition of spreading ``unfounded rumors'' and
told a news conference any violence would be organized by the
extreme left.
   Opposition leaders, the church and the U.S. State Department
said Monday they had information that pro-government provocateurs
might carry out attacks to create a pretext for declaring an
emergency and curfew, perhaps with the goal of annulling the
results.
   Cardemil said there were no plans to declare an emergency or, as
some people fear, to require that television and radio stations
broadcast only official information, but he added: ``I can't make
any assurances.''
   Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander who seized power in
September 1973, trails in most polls.
   His name is alone on the ballot. Chile's 7.4 million registered
voters are asked to respond ``yes'' or ``no'' to a proposal by the
general and other military chiefs that he remain in power until
1997.
   If a majority says yes, Pinochet will begin a new eight-year
term in March. If the result is negative, an open election is to be
held next year, with power being turned over to the winner in March
1990.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Harry Barnes was summoned for a
private meeting with Foreign Minister Ricardo Garcia, who was
evidently angered by a newspaper article in which Barnes was quoted
as saying he prefers an opposition victory in the referendum.
   The embassy issued a statement denying that Barnes publicly took
sides in the vote, saying Barnes reiterated in the article ``the
wish of the United States for a rapid return to democracy as well
as its firm support for basic human rights.''
   Neither Barnes nor Garcia commented publicly after the meeting.
   The New York Times on Tuesday quoted Barnes as saying in an
interview in Santiago: ``I look forward to coming back in March
1990, when the first democratically elected President would be
inaugurated if the ``no'' wins, rather than having to wait until
1997.
   ``At this point I think the `no' will win, if the process
doesn't get interrupted,'' Barnes was quoted as saying.
   Congressional elections are planned for 1990, whatever the
referendum's outcome. The last legislature was disbanded
immediately after the military ousted the elected government of
President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist who died during the
coup 15 years ago.
   The new congress will be virtually powerless to amend Pinochet's
1980 constitution, which gives the military both autonomy and a
supervisory role in making national policy, because of provisions
written into the charter.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party and spokesman for a 16-party opposition coalition, said the
referendum was certain to go against Pinochet.
   ``We are going to vote and we are going to win,'' he told
reporters.
   Polls open at 8 a.m. (7 a.m. EDT) and close at 5 p.m. (4 p.m.
EDT), but will be allowed to stay open longer to accommodate lines
of voters.
   Both the Interior Ministry and the opposition coalition plan to
make unofficial tallies, but the official count by the national
election board is not expected until Friday.
   Wednesday has been declared a holiday and sale of alcoholic
beverages will be prohibited.

   President Francois Mitterrand toured the
devastated streets of this ancient southern city Tuesday, where the
death toll from a flash flood climbed to 11.
   About a hundred of the estimated 50,000 people whose homes were
damaged by the wall of water and mud on Monday chanted,
``compensation, compensation'' as Mitterrand arrived with senior
officials.
   The president said the government would do everything possible
``to respond to the perfectly legitimate demand of those who
naturally expect reparations, but also expect that their immediate
crying needs be met.''
   He then made a walking tour of some of the hardest-hit
districts, where water five feet deep surged on Monday after an
unexpected and tightly focused storm struck Nimes, a city of
130,000 known known for its Roman monuments.
   Rain levels recorded downtown were more than 10 times higher
than those at the airport just outside the city.
   As firefighters and rescue workers checked cars and trucks that
had been washed away in the flood they found three more bodies
Tuesday, raising to 11 the number of people killed in the disaster.
   More than 30,000 people were still without telephone service on
Tuesday, although blocked highways and streets had nearly all been
reopened and rail traffic resumed.
   The French army sent more than 5,000 soldiers to help with
relief and supply work.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Politburo, endorsing greater openness
in public affairs, ordered two new publications established to
provide more information about the Communist Party and government,
Tass reported Tuesday.
   The official news agency reported the Politburo also reviewed
plans for a Central Committee meeting devoted to agriculture, but
did not say when the conference would be held.
   It said the Politburo ordered plans drawn up for an overhaul of
management in the farm sector, traditionally one of the weakest
performers in the Soviet economy.
   Tass said one publication will cover the activities of the
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee and the other
will be produced by the Council of Ministers, the Soviet Cabinet.
   It said the 12-member Politburo made the decision during a
meeting Monday. No reason was given for the delayed report.
   At a nationwide Communist Party conference in June and July some
delegates said they were told little about the actions of the
Central Committee and they did not even know the responsibilities
of individual party leaders.
   Tass reported the Politburo ordered the publication of a journal
to be called ``News of the CC of the CPSU'' _ Central Committee of
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
   ``It is planned that it will officially publish the decisions of
top party organs and draft resolutions on major issues of party and
public affairs,'' the agency said.
   A newspaper to be called ``Government News'' will be established
to inform the public on how the government's economic, social and
cultural decisions are being carried out and on the progress of
perestroika, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for reforms,
according to Tass.
   ``It was stressed at the (Politburo) meeting that the
publication of the journal and the newspaper will be in line with
the party's policy of deepening the democratism of the political
system of our society and promote greater openness in state
affairs,'' Tass said.
   It did not say when the publications would first appear, how
often they would be published or the number of copies to be
printed. It was unclear how their content would differ from
existing Soviet publications, many of which are controlled by the
Central Committee or government.
   Tass said the journal will report periodically on the activities
of the Central Committee and print transcripts of important party
meetings and conferences, information about party elections,
biographies of leaders and historical material from party archives.

   Pillsbury Co.'s stock skyrocketed Tuesday
after Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC launched a surprise $5.17
billion tender offer, and the food conglomerate moved to block the
proposal in state courts.
   The bid, which caught the nation's fourth-largest food company
off guard, offers Pillsbury stockholders $60 cash for each of 86.2
million common shares outstanding.
   On Wall Street, Pillsbury stock soared $18 a share to $57 in
heavy trading composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Pillsbury said in a statement late in the day that its board
would review the offer ``at an appropriate time.'' A spokesman said
Pillsbury was not approached by the British liquor, food and
retailing giant before the takeover offer was announced.
   Pillsbury also said in a later statement it had sued to block
the acquisition in 13 states, contending a buyout by Grand Met
would violate state liquor laws prohibiting liquor manufacturers
from owning retail liquor outlets, namely some of Pillsbury's
restaurants.
   Courts in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Michigan,
Kansas, Pennsylvania and Missouri already have issued temporary
restraining orders enjoining Grand Met from acquiring any Pillsbury
stock, and a Delaware court has rejected Grand Met's effort to stop
those actions, Pillsbury said.
   Ian A. Martin, Grand Metropolitan's chief executive for U.S.
operations, said he tried unsuccessfully to contact Pillsbury
Chairman Philip L. Smith after arriving in Minneapolis Tuesday
morning. He said he did not want the offer to be interpreted as a
hostile takeover.
   ``We are very interested in doing this thing in a gentlemanly
manner,'' he said. ``The sooner we get in a conversation with them,
the happier we'll be.''
   Although the bid came as a surprise, Pillsbury had been viewed
as a potential takeover target because of its lackluster
performance and turnover in its top management.
   In July, Smith, then chairman of rival General Foods Corp.,
replaced William H. Spoor as Pillsbury's chairman. Spoor came out
of retirement earlier this year to run the company on an interim
basis after the former chairman, John Stafford, resigned under
pressure.
   The company has been trying to rebound from the effect of a
restructuring that caused its profit to fall to $69.3 million in
fiscal 1988, on sales of $6.2 billion.
   Analysts called the Grand Metropolitan offer a fair price.
   ``It's going to be a bid that Pillsbury management is going to
have difficulty defending against,'' said John M. McMillen, an
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``I think
they'll fight it initially _ attempt to fight it _ but I think it's
a losing battle.''
   Stephen Carnes, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Hopwood in
Minneapolis, said Grand Metropolitan indicated its offer was
negotiable, and he predicted the price would rise.
   ``We put a top price at $70 (a share), not higher than that,''
Carnes said.
   ``I think Pillsbury management is going to have a tough time
snubbing this offer off,'' he said. ``This is a premium price.''
   Grand Metropolitan said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that if the bid succeeded it planned to sell
off Pillsbury's Steak & Ale and Bennigan's restaurant operations.
Distron Distribution, Pillsbury's in-house distribution system for
its Burger King restaurants, also would be sold, the filing said.
   The struggling restaurant division provides about half of
Pillsbury's revenues.
   Pillsbury management has been under pressure to either boost
revenues at Burger King, the world's second-largest restaurant
chain, or sell it. But Grand Metropolitan executives are bullish on
Burger King's prospects.
   ``We believe Burger King's problems have been overrated,'' said
Martin.
   The London-based Grand Metropolitan, maker of Smirnoff vodka and
J&B Scotch, is intent on focusing on its foods, liquor and
retailing operations and expanding its operations in North America.
   On Friday it announced it was selling its Inter-Continental
hotel chain to a Japanese concern and earmarked the $2.27 billion
in cash it received for acquisitions.
   With annual sales of about $10 billion, Grand Metropolitan's
businesses also include hotels, Alpo petfood and Pearle vision
centers.
   Analysts speculated Grand Metropolitan was most interested in
Pillsbury for its Green Giant vegetable, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and
Van de Kamp's frozen fish operations.
   Martin agreed there were good prospects for marketing
Pillsbury's food products overseas, especially its microwavable
foods.
   Grand Metropolitan also is embroiled in a contested bid for
Irish Distillers Group PLC, Ireland's leading whisky maker, for
which Grand Metropolitan has offered around $465 million.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush are sticking

despite the League of Women Voters' withdrawal as sponsors in a
dispute over control of format and other details.
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, sponsors of

   ``There is going to be a second presidential debate,'' said Bush

   The second debate, viewed as an opportunity for Dukakis as he
trails Bush in most polls, was scheduled to be held in Los Angeles
on Oct. 13 or 14, depending on the length of the American League

   President Reagan won't get to ride on a new
Air Force One before he leaves office because the airplane's
contractor is months behind schedule with no prospect of making up
the delay, Air Force and company officials say.
   The Boeing Co., which is building the new Air Force One and a
back-up plane by customizing huge 747 passenger jet airframes,
``advised us last week they won't be prepared even to finalize a
new delivery schedule until mid-to-late October,'' Lt. Col. Darrel
C. Hayes, an Air Force spokesman, said Monday.
   ``So, obviously, delivery won't occur in November as anticipated
but rather next year,'' Hayes continued. ``And the delivery is
going to occur later in the year, probably summer, and not in
January (before Reagan steps down).''
   Boeing's contract with the Air Force called for delivery of the
first plane by Nov. 30. Three months ago, however, Air Force
officials disclosed Boeing was going to miss that deadline because
of problems with installing wiring for the plane's specialized
communications gear.

   Chileans stocked up on foodstuffs,

violence may follow the vote.
   ``I know nothing and don't care about politics, but I don't want

supermarket in Providencia, a fashionable residential neighborhood.
   Several supermarket managers reported a steep rise in buying in
recent days, but said the situation did not seem extreme.
   ``I'd call it worry buying, not panic buying,'' Alejandro Baeza,
manager of the Unimarc supermarket in the southern Santiago
middle-class neighborhood of La Florida, said.
   Shoppers were reported purchasing mostly non-perishable
foodstuffs, fearful they will be left without refrigerators since
blackouts are a common occurrence in Chile in times of political
tension.

   When he retired from the State
Police last December, Lt. Robert L. Beadle was a 23-year veteran
with expertise in child abuse cases.
   Four months later, he found himself on the other side of the
fence, charged with raping two girls, one 11 years old, the other
13.
   Two juries acquitted Beadle in August and September, but the
verdicts haven't ended his personal trial.
   Beadle, 52, says being accused of the very crime he dedicated
part of his life to solving will always haunt him.
   ``The only way I'm going to clear my name is to go out and catch
the guy who committed these crimes, and I've already started my
investigation,'' he said in an interview Friday at his home in this
northern Michigan city.
   State police investigators say that although the case is closed,
they still have serious questions about Beadle, who also has faced
two indecent exposure charges in the past year.

Tuesday to dampen speculation about why an Indian-born U.S.
resident was freed.
   In the wake of Mithileshwar Singh's release, President Reagan

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government

we're not negotiating, and we're not holding discussions that could

other kinds of cancer, the National Cancer Institute announced

   Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer _ involving removal of

sometimes do not detect the cancer until it has spread and can no
longer be cured, the cancer institute said.

detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors. The test
has also been used to detect kidney cancer, prostate cancer and a
nerve-cell cancer called neuroblastoma, he said.

conference, arguing that Nestle has failed to live up to the
agreements it signed in 1984 that ended the original action.
   This time, said Johnson, the group is expanding the boycott to
American Home Products, which it said is the second largest
distributor of infant formula in developing nations.

   A major earthquake is nearly certain to strike
the eastern two-thirds of the nation in the next 20 years,
threatening havoc in a region unprepared for such a disaster, the
head of the national earthquake engineering center said Tuesday.
   Robert L. Ketter declined to pin down a specific location for
the temblor, but he said likely sites include the areas of Memphis,
Tenn., Charleston, S.C., Boston and New York City.
   The probability of a destructive quake occurring at any
particular spot is low, he said.

   Amnesty International on Wednesday accused a
record 135 nations of human rights abuses ranging from the jailing
of draft evaders in Western Europe to the massacre of unarmed
civilians in Iraq and Sudan.
   The international human rights group said the list of offenders
in its annual survey was the longest it has published since its
establishment in 1961.
   Amnesty, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, recorded
abuses last year in more than 80 percent of the 159 U.N. member
states. But it said it was encouraged by the emergence of more than
1,000 human rights groups in recent years and the proliferation of
laws to protect prisoners' rights.

   State and federal officials on Tuesday
dedicated the first Head Start day-care center in the nation for
children with AIDS and said the program is expected to be a model
for the rest of the country.
   ``Poor children with a terrible disease are a very easy
constituency to forget,'' Gov. Thomas H. Kean said. ``This center,
with its Head Start background, will help children turn trouble
into opportunity.''
   U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Sydney J.

   NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics dominated
two weeks of prime time but concluded Sunday with an average rating
below the guarantee NBC gave advertisers, and that will cost the
network millions.
   NBC, which paid more than $300 million for the rights to the
Olympics, won't comment on the loss, but the Wall Street Journal
reported the network will have to give as much as $70 million in
commercial time to advertisers who didn't get as high a rating as
they were promised.
   The 15 nights of Olympics coverage from Seoul _ not counting the
opening and closing ceremonies _ averaged a 17.9 rating. NBC had
promised advertisers 21.2. The 1984 summer games on ABC had
averaged 23.2.

<HEAD>Maxene Andrews Is Host of `All Night Strut' on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The young quartet singing songs from the 1930s
and '40s on the PBS' special ``The All Night Strut!'' could not
have been praised by a more authentic source.
   ``I got quite carried away. It had been a long time since I'd
seen a revue like that,'' said Maxene Andrews, one-time member of
the singing Andrews Sisters and host of the 90-minute special,
airing Friday.
   The quartet didn't do the 28 songs just like they were done in
those decades, though, said Miss Andrews, who does not sing on the
special.
   ``I think interpretations weren't as theatrical then. They do a
couple of very exciting, theatrical things in this show. Our
interpretations were more musical,'' she said.
   ``There was so much wonderful energy that they gave the show. I
sat there and thoroughly enjoyed it.''
   The singer, who now tours the country more than half the year
with her one-woman show, said even though the '30s had the
Depression, and the '40s had World War II, the songs were mainly
cheerful. She tells the audience, ``We were a nation of optimists,
full of confidence, sure that the future was bright, and the songs
of the time reflected those feelings.''
   In the years before World War II, Miss Andrews said, ``Benny
Goodman came in, and he started the Swing Era. It seemed like the
Depression was coming to an end, and jobs were more plentiful.
Everybody wanted to tap their toes. It got to be a bit of a frenzy.
Nightclubs were busy. There was lots of talent around, and lots of
places to go to see the talent.''
   Fran Charnas, on the faculty of Boston Conservatory, created the
review, ``The All Night Strut!'' which had its premiere in 1975 in
Cleveland. Since then, various singers have toured with it. The
present quartet, Katharine Buffaloe, Janet Hubert, Lance Roberts
and Jim Walton, played for two weeks at Penn State University, and
one of those concerts was taped for PBS.
   Three of the songs were Andrews Sisters records, the
boogie-woogie hit ``Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar,'' ``Shoo Shoo
Baby'' and ``You're a Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith.''
   The Andrews Sisters sang some of the others, too, Miss Andrews
said, but after other singers or bands had made them popular _
``Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' ``Coming In on a Wing and a
Prayer,'' ``I'll Be Seeing You'' and ``In the Mood.''
   The Andrews Sisters had 19 hit records, starting with ``Bei Mir
Bist Du Schoen'' in 1937. ``It was important to have a hit
record,'' Miss Andrews said. ``After that, did you have a good act?
After that, it was, `I hope they pick me up for motion pictures.'
There wasn't much chance for groups in pictures. We were one of the
lucky ones; I think we did 21 movies.''
   For the last nine years, Miss Andrews has sung alone. The oldest
sister, LaVerne, died of cancer in 1967. Maxene and Patty were on
Broadway in ``Over Here!'' in 1974. ``After the show, my
brother-in-law kicked me out of the nest,'' Maxene said. ``He said,
`Your sister is not going to sing with you any more. She is going
to go out on her own.'
   ``We have no contact. I'm sorry to say it's impossible. I miss
Patty very much. You learn there are some things you can do
something about and some things you can't do anything about.
   ``Patty always sang lead. I never sang lead before. It was very
frightening, but it was the best thing for me. I met a young
pianist, Phil Campanella, who understood what I wanted to do, and
we've worked together all these years.
   ``We've just finished 80 one-nighters. Now I've taken off some
time, because I am exploring with a country-western album. That's a
lot of fun. I still retain that tremendous joy in singing. The Lord
has been good to me and allowed me to retain my voice.
   ``Age doesn't bother me. Sometimes I'm prone to let my mind
wander when I'm performing an old song I know well. I'll forget the
lyrics. I'll stop. They know I forgot. The audience knows the
lyrics to Andrews Sisters hits. I say, `I earned that mistake. What
do you do when you're 72 years old?'''

   SYNDIE NEWS COMPETITION _ King World, syndicator of ``Wheel of

will get into the newsmagazine business with ``Inside Edition'' in
January 1989. King has picked up producers from Fox's schlocky
newsmagazines ``A Current Affair'' and ``The Reporters.'' King says
``Inside Edition'' will concentrate on ``stories of courage, hope,
humor and tragedy.'' The presumption is that King is expecting to
run off GTG Entertainment's ``USA Today: The Television Show,''
which was pummeled by critics after its debut a month ago. But GTG

<HEAD>Is Corporate America Really Chaotic?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If corporate America is in the midst of chaos,
asks Professor Eugene Jennings, why is it earning so much?
   Jennings' rhetorical question was provoked by the popularity of
a current best seller, ``Managing Chaos,'' by Tom Peters, who
several years ago captured the fancy of readers with ``In Search of
Excellence.''
   If corporate America is in a period of chaos, said Jennings,
then it is indeed managing it well, since return on equity for the
first half of 1988 was more than 20 percent, the first time that's
been done since 1950.
   Besides, he wondered, if you manage chaos well do you still have
chaos or do you have a contradiction?
   What is seen as chaos by some, says Jennings, who himself has
written many analytical books about corporations and is a
confidential adviser to chief executive officers, is the emergence
of a new way of doing things.
   In this transitional period, he says, old ideas have not totally
lost their usefulness, while the credibility of emerging ideas has
not been fully evaluated.
   In this emerging world, Jennings states, each corporation is
seeking an optimal meld of old and new practices and policies,
especially in regard to people and technology.
   Some companies, he observes, moved too quickly toward intensive
high-tech manufacturing as a way of remaining globally competitive.
General Motors, for example, had to pull back because its people
system was not yet rebuilt.
   Ford chose the reverse schedule, stressing its people system
first and letting high-tech warm on the back burner until it could
be accommodated.
   ``Once corporate America has its optimal meld of the two, then
look for it to move ahead aggressively. Parked on the doorstep are
some high-tech equipment and processes that, when introduced, will
make the past 20 years look puny.''
   Some companies will go too fast, he warns, and they will create
the semblance of chaos. But, he adds:
   ``For the most part, business history shows that once we get a
workable relationship between people and high-tech we can stick to
it for several decades.''
   These are some of the ``people'' transitions that Jennings sees
as under way:
   _Old ideas of respect for authority being replaced by respect
for the idea.
   _Central decision making giving way to problem-driven decision
making.
   _Rewarding for results, rather than simply for corporate loyalty.
   _Machine systems, in which individuals performed almost as cogs,
evolving into people-oriented operations that stress human skills.
   Once an optimal working relationship is established, says
Jennings, it still might be as demanding as the old conveyor belt.
   ``People will have to keep up,'' he warns. ``A system built
around human qualities can turn out to be just as coercive as one
built around the assembly line or a machine master.''
   But, he adds, there will be a major difference. With regard to
the introduction of technology, the melds made today between old
and new allow for much more flexibility than the machine systems of
the past.
   He believes the evolution of such concepts as lifetime
employment, for example, are likely to lessen opposition to
changing work styles, which in the past have caused upheavals in
business and personal lives.
   ``If you know how to read the changes you'll find that this
emergent world is not chaotic,'' said Jennings. Instead, it is
carefully, slowly evolving, and will lead to stability when new and
old notions are melded at their optimum.
   The professor, who teaches business at Michigan State
University, suggested that a lot of popular notions about business
might be in the minds of the viewer rather than in the reality of
the marketplace.
   Five years ago, he said, several dozen companies were extolled
in ``In Search of Excellence.'' Two-thirds of them, said the
professor, later got into financial difficulties.

<TEXT>
   On a recent weekday, the Rev.
Alphonse Stephenson is chain-smoking and still managing to talk at
a rapid-fire pace, filling the air with cigarette smoke and waving
arms.
   Even in church on Sunday, parishioners accustomed to a quiet
Mass are either delighted or somewhat taken aback when the
38-year-old priest bounces down the aisles, filling his sermons
with humorous stories and priest-to-parishioner banter.
   Stephenson throws himself into the priesthood with a joyful
abandon, but it's not his only devotion.
   ``I'm a professional musician called to be a priest,'' he said.
``I've seen too many priests who are burned out because they look
at the priesthood as a profession.''
   From 1980 to 1986, Stephenson took a full-time leave of absence
from the ministry to serve as conductor for ``A Chorus Line,'' both
on the national tour and on Broadway.
   After his performances, he relaxed at his grandparents' home in
Point Pleasant Beach, a cottage where a black concert piano
dominates the living room and a talkative gray parrot rules the
dining room.
   He became involved in religious life again by making friends
with priests at the local church, St. Peter by the Sea. Soon, he
found himself helping the short-staffed parish by celebrating
Sunday Mass.
   The return to a religious atmosphere came at the same time that
Stephenson felt a need to do different kinds of music _ something
beyond ``A Chorus Line.''
   ``I wanted to do a concert,'' he said.
   He called upon a local musicians' union and found 42 very
interested colleagues. In April 1986, they gave their first concert
at St. Peter by the Sea. It was an instant success, Stephenson
said, inspiring people who were surprised to hear Beethoven and
other classical composers in a church setting.
   ``A church is where the origin of majestry begins,'' he said.
``It's a very different religious experience.
   ``And after paying the musicians, the church was able to realize
a nice profit,'' Stephenson said.
   Soon afterward, the musical priest met Roger Bernier, a local
financial consultant who now serves as the orchestra's business
manager.
   ``Together we began thinking, `If the orchestra makes such a
profit for one pastor, why can't it have the same effect for other
parishes?''' Stephenson said.
   In its first year as a formal group, the Orchestra of St. Peter
by the Sea raised more than $250,000 for charitable organizations
in the New Jersey area, Bernier said.
   Organizations needing money hold ``raffles, bingo, pot luck
suppers, a typical 1950s dance to raise funds, but then they start
to run out of ideas,'' Stephenson said.
   At first, many are skeptical of a classical concert in a church
setting ``because they expect a religious flavor,'' he said. ``The
concerts do have a religious bent ... but I talk to the audience,
describe the music and how the musicians are feeling and the
emotions of the composer at the time he wrote the piece.''
   Many symphony orchestras have lost audiences because they fail
to teach the finer points, Bernier said.
   The Orchestra of St. Peter by the Sea is looking to expand its
audience, Bernier said, perhaps by performing at colleges and in
other states. Stephenson would also like to perform in large
churches; he fondly recalls a concert at St. Paul's Church in New
York City ``that was absolutely majestic.''
   Stephenson's next project is to create a ``sacred music program
... for large, acoustically perfect, beautiful cathedrals that have
never heard this music in years.''
   The music would be along the scope of a production such as the
well-known ``Handel's Messiah,'' he said, but would concentrate on
long-lost religious works that modern orchestras would probably
never consider.
   Ideally, the priest hopes to find benefactors who would
financially support such a venture to open it to the public for
free.
   ``I'd be looking for older people who feel the church needs this
again, people concerned about the arts who see that the church was
always a preserver and promoter of the arts,'' he said.
   Another challenge will be to persuade a prospective audience to
listen to a sacred music performance, Stephenson said.
   ``People will not leave the church and say, `Oh, I've been
converted,''' he said. ``I'm suggesting that it could be used as a
motivator of faith, whatever your faith may be.''
   Stephenson maintains that his concerts could move even a
17-year-old fan of new wave rock music.
   ``Parents make a big mistake in the United States when they say
things like, oh, that's `their' music,'' he said. ``Twisted Sister
might be jolly to teen-agers now, but I wonder when they turn 80 if
they'll get the same enjoyment out of it, and if it will refresh
their soul.''

   The five top U.S. military chaplains are
presently all pastors of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
   That the five have emerged as heads of the military chaplaincies
is a ``historic moment'' for the denomination, says its officer for
federal chaplaincies, Chaplain Loyd W. Lyngdal.
   The five are Rear Adm. Alvin B. Koeneman, Navy chief of
chaplains; Maj. Gen. Norris L. Einertson, chief of Army chaplains;
Maj. Gen. Stuart E. Barstad, chief of Air Force chaplains; Capt.
Walter A. Hiskett, Marine chief of chaplains, and Chaplain Herbert

   An interdenominational organization
that works to uphold the nation's religious qualities, the
Religious Heritage of America, has named the Rev. Charles R.
Swindoll as ``Clergyman oot enough.
   Schools pass the extra costs on to parents and, because parents
have little money, to the parents' work units.
   ``Most work units go along because if they don't the school may
refuse to take their workers' children,'' said one Beijing worker
with a 7-year-old daughter.
   ``The State Education Commission opposes charging fees, but the
situation is quite complicated,'' a commission spokesman, Yuan
Yongtang, told The Associated Press. In many cases, he said, the
schools have no other choice if they want to stay open.
   Yuan said the commission does not keep track of what schools
charge. But a spate of reports in the official press in recent
weeks hints at the extent of the problem.
   The Liberation Road Primary School in the eastern city of
Lianyugang, for example, panicked parents when it demanded their
work units supply 1,000 to 3,000 yuan ($270 to $810) for each
student. China Youth News said some units refused and many students
were kept from class.
   ``This is overt extortion,'' it quoted one parent as saying.
   The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, published a
picture of a dozen elementary school children in the central city
of Wuhan standing outside their school gate with signs around their
necks reading, ``We want to study.'' They had been banned from
class after their parents' work units refused to pay school fees,
the size of which was not given.
   An official at the Wuhan Foreign Affairs Office, who identified
himself as Comrade Yang, said other schools in Wuhan also barred
students because of inability to pay fees that he said generally
range from 30 yuan ($8) to 100 yuan ($27).
   Yang said the Wuhan city government ordered schools in September
to accept all school-age children. He added that he believed all
students were in class by month's end.
   The State Education Commission also declared in September that
``excessive fees'' would not be permitted, but set no specific
ceilings. There is no limit on the donations a school can accept,
so schools that have good relations with parents' work units agree
quietly on what is needed and call it a donation.
   Problems arise only when the work units balk.
   ``We have good relations with several work units,'' said Mrs.
Gao of Hujialou Primary School. ``They fix windows or doors or give
us a little money.'' One unit donated cooking equipment for the
cafeteria, she said. She refused to give the amount of annual
donations.
   Many schools also set up small factories on their grounds, with
teachers and staff as workers.
   ``No. 80 Middle School assembles calculators,'' Mrs. Gao said
with envy. ``Our teaching staff here is very small so we can't
spare anyone to do this sort of work.''
   But Hujialou does send a teacher to a nearby factory to keep its
books, with most of the teacher's factory salary going to the
school.

arrival, many farmers face a bitter harvest, wondering if they've
produced enough to keep them on the land another year. For a few
fortunate farmers where rain has fallen, it will be a bountiful
harvest, a time to celebrate one of their best years ever.
Side-by-side stories look at two counties in Iowa at harvest time:
Carroll, blessed by rain, and Washington, cursed by drought.

   In the waning days of the searing summer, the
Hundling family journeyed to a nearby farm festival, hauling
10-foot corn stalks that hung out the back of their pickup truck.
They left with two blue ribbons.
   It's been that kind of year.
   While farmers across the Midwest have cursed Mother Nature for
delivering a devastating drought, the Hundlings sing sweet praises
to her _ their new Lady Luck.
   ``We're really blessed to get what we got here,'' said Shelley
Hundling, who farms with her husband, David, and their two children
amid the rolling hills outside this rural hamlet.
   What they got was rain _ plenty of it. In a year when the soil
was sucked dry, crops collapsed and farmers in much of the nation's
heartland cursed the blue skies overhead, Carroll County has seen
an embarrassment of riches.
   ``How would I describe it? Extremely fortunate that we've got
the rainfall,'' said Dennis Molitor, county extension adviser.
``Farmers are realizing it's just a stroke of luck they've got it
here. It's kind of an oasis in the Midwest.''
   ``On a scale of 10, it'll be an 8 or 9,'' Breda farmer Roger
Nieland said in describing the coming harvest.
   The county recorded 21.05 inches of rain from April through
August _ slightly above the normal 19.5 inches in the same period.
Though a few dry pockets can be found, Molitor said 80 percent of
Carroll County is in good shape.
   For farmers in this pocket of west-central Iowa, it will be a
bountiful harvest. ``They've got the best of both worlds,'' Molitor
said. ``They've got an excellent crop and excellent prices. Very
rarely does that occur.''
   Corn, for example, he said, has increased from $2.62 a bushel
from $1.42 a bushel a year ago; soybeans are about $8 a bushel,
compared with $4.96 a bushel a year ago. If a farmer produces 150
bushels of corn an acre, he said, it could mean an additional $174
per acre.
   ``We're reaping the benefits,'' Molitor said, ``and other
farmers are suffering the consequences.''
   Farming prospects in general have improved in recent years after
the worst financial crunch in agriculture since the Depression. In
1987, net cash farm income _ the yearly amount farmers have
available to spend _ was estimated by the government at a record
$57.1 billion.
   The Agriculture Department is forecasting 1988 net cash income
could reach $55 billion to $60 billion.
   When it comes to Iowa, experts say it's too early to determine
the impact of the drought on the state economy, but early signs are
encouraging. Experts say August sales tax revenues were 10.5
percent higher than in the same period in 1987. But last August had
two more working days than the same month in 1987.
   And though much of Carroll County, made briefly famous in 1959
when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev paid a visit, is a picture of
prosperity with lush green fields and rich black soil, not many
farmers are boasting about it.
   ``It's almost kind of embarrassing,'' said Paul De Shaw, a
broker who also farms and expects to his yields to be as good as
1987's bumper crop.
   ``You feel guilty about saying how good the crop looks,'' sai
Hundling's brother and farming partner, Charles. ``It's nothing you
did. You feel you can't be happy ... even though you're happy.''
   But merchants in Carroll, the county seat, are relieved.
   ``When the weather is bad, farmers may have the same amount of
money but may not be as willing to let go of it,'' said C.J. Niles,
executive vice president of the Carroll Chamber of Commerce. ``When
it's good, business is good.''
   Carroll is also luckier than many other rural towns, business
leaders say, because it has an industrial base and isn't totally
dependent on the farm economy. Its location in the center of
western Iowa attracts thousands of shoppers from scores of nearby
towns.
   Today, there's plenty of reason for optimism here. Land values,
Molitor said, are up 24 percent in the last two years and county
yields, on the average, should match those of last year: 115
bushels of corn an acre; 38 bushels for soybeans. The county also
is a big hog producer.
   Hundling also predicts a harvest that should equal last year's,
when he reaped as much as 150 bushels of corn an acre.
   ``My dad said it'll be your best or one of your best ever,'' the
lanky, soft-spoken farmer said modestly. ``You trust the
old-timers.''
   Iowa farm country has long been good to the Hundlings. They live
in the home that belonged to Hundling's great-grandfather, a 19th
century Presbyterian minister who published and printed a German
language newspaper from a building behind his house.
   Hundling followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father
in tilling the soil outside this tiny town of 450. Even in the
darkest Dust Bowl days, the family always had a harvest.
   Despite that record, Hundling plays down his repeated good
fortune.
   Molitor said that's typical for a farmer.
   ``Farmers are always extremely reluctant to admit success or
prosperity,'' he said. ``They feel they're going to be exploited.
... It's just a very shrewd business decision.''
   And this season wasn't trouble-free: A May hail storm ripped
across the farm and forced Hundling to replant nearly 100 acres.
``We've paid a price this year, too, in lost soil and lost time,''
he said, almost defensively.
   But the rains came, they fell steadily and no one dared grumble.
One 5-inch rain fell in July.
   ``We woke up the morning of July 17th, we were walking on air,''
Hundling said. ``It was relief. ... It was kind of a holiday. ...
With corn, you've got to have the rain at pollination time. It was
there right when you needed it.''
   His crop shows it. The soil is smooth, and the golden corn, with
fat kernels, ears touching one another, towers well above the
6-foot-tall Hundling.
   In August, the Hundlings proudly displayed three giant stalks at
a small farm festival in Wall Lake. Their two children won two
contests _ the best corn and the tallest _ and walked off with blue
ribbons, no surprise to their father.
   ``When we brought them in,'' he said, ``people just knew we were
going to win.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Smooth, Sexy Vocals of Sade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one looks or sounds quite like Sade, so it
should come as no surprise that her entry into show business came
under unusual circumstances.
   ``I was driving along with a friend in London and we both said,
`God, it's misty.' We went to visit somebody and `Misty' was
playing on the radio. Someone than asked me if I was going to see
`Misty in Roots' (a reggae band) tomorrow.
   ``I went and I met these boys that I was at school with. They
said they've got a group. Was I interested in singing? Do I know
any singers who could just rehearse? They pursuaded me that I
should join them.''
   The rest, as they say, is pop history: three platinum albums,
five Top 10 singles and total record sales of over 20 million. But
in the beginning...
   ``I remember my first concert,'' she recalled. ``Our stage was
built on empty beer crates. I had to stand still because my heels
got stuck in the cracks. It's not easy.''
   But how many singers make it seem as easy as Sade? Her relaxed
vocals, influenced by Marvin Gaye and Nina Simone among others,
helped make ``Smooth Operator'' a hit single in 1984, while
``Diamond Life,'' became the all-time best-selling debut album for
a female British singer.
   Sade, the singer, should be distinguished from ``Sade,'' her
group, composed of Stuart Matthewman on guitar and saxophone,
Andrew Hale on keyboards and Paul S. Denman on bass.
   ``Sade'' won a Grammy in 1985 for best new artist.
   ``I think anybody who is the least bit interested really knows
it's not just coming from me,'' the singer said. ``Rather than me
with a backing band of musicians, we're talking about a group of
people.''
   One problem at first was songwriting; no one in the group had
any experience.
   ``Stewart and Andrew are musically well-educated. Paul and I are
ignorant,'' Sade said. ``It isn't hard to find the ability. It does
take a lot out of you. You fight with the songs. You fight to get
how you want it to feel or sound. The ability isn't that special.''
   Sade was typically low-key about her success.
   ``The ultimate goal is to simply get pressed onto vinyl. There
are not that many people who approach it that way.''
   She also downplayed the impact of her unique appearance.
   ``Occasionally, I get marriage proposals _ from women as well,''
Sade said with a laugh. ``You don't get to people's hearts by the
way you look. I don't think success can be sustained on an image
alone. Once someone's got a photograph of you, that's the end of
it.''
   ``Diamond Life'' was just the beginning. The next album, 1985's
``Promise,'' was an even bigger seller and yielded the hit single,
``Sweetest Taboo.''
   Sade has been active politically as well, appearing at
anti-apartheid concerts and a benefit for Nelson Mandela, the
imprisoned leader of the African National Congress.
   ``I've got a conscience,'' Sade said. ``I've been brought up to
be concerned not only about what affects me immediately. It's more
a question of compassion or consciousness. The oppression of any
people is important to me.''
   The latest album, ``Stronger Than Pride,'' took about a year to
make. Although the songs, written in Spain and London, have the
same gentle rhythms as the previous records, Sade insists that
``Pride'' is the group's most upbeat record.
   ``I thought it was a lot harder than the other albums,'' she
said. ``It depends on the volume, the context in which you listen.
`Turn My Back' through big speakers in a club may sound hard and
loud.''
   All four members contributed to the songs on ``Stronger Than
Pride.'' The title track, a Top 10 single, was inspired by a
conversation Sade had with a friend.
   ``We were talking about pride. I said one thing is stronger than
pride, and that's love. The sentiment is something I always felt.''
   Sade was born Helen Folasude Adu in 1959, the daughter of a
Nigerian teacher and his British wife. Her parents separated when
she was 4, and Sade moved with her mother to London's North End.
   At St. Martin's College in London, she studied fashion and had
created her own line of menswear before pursuing a career in music,
joining a jazz-funk band, ``Pride,'' in 1982.
   She has come a long way since performing on beer crates and
recently played to sell-out crowds here at Radio City Music Hall.
   ``It's easier for me to sing in front of the audience,'' she
said. ``In the studio, we've only just written the songs. Once you
start rehearsing, you actually do better. You're stimulated by the
audience. Your singing's more heartfelt.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Ten Parallel Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As he labored on the life of George Bernard
Shaw, Michael Holroyd had an advantage not available to earlier
biographers: He had no help from Shaw.
   ``What I discovered was that the major biographies of him _
certainly Archibald Henderson's, Frank Harris' _ had actually been
written to a considerable extent by Shaw himself in the third
person,'' Holroyd said. ``He had ghosted his own life.
   ``Indeed, it is possible to say that some of the more severe
passages are actually written by Shaw.''
   Holroyd has just completed ``Bernard Shaw: The Search for Love''
(Random House, $24.95), which takes Shaw from childhood in Dublin
to his early years in London, his first romantic affair with a
friend of his mother and his marriage to Charlotte Payne-Townshend
in 1898.
   Two more volumes are to follow next year and in 1991.
   The amount of material to cover was enormous. Shaw was a
novelist; a music critic; a playwright whose works included
``Pygmalion,'' ``Man and Superman'' and ``St. Joan''; a Fabian
socialist, a militant vegetarian, a reformer of spelling and a
tireless writer of letters.
   At the end of a 50-page letter he once wrote, ``Forgive this
long letter. I didn't have time to write a short one.''
   It has been 13 years since Holroyd began the project, which was
initiated by Shaw's residual legatees: the British Museum, the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Gallery of Ireland.
   Holroyd, a 53-year-old Londoner who is married to the novelist
Margaret Drabble, did not go to college. He says the subjects of
his biographies _ Lytton Strachey in 1968, Augustus John in 1974
and now Shaw _ have been his professors.
   Since the last major biographies were published in 1956, the
centenary of the great man's birth, many letters, diaries and
manuscripts have come to light, Holroyd said.
   So rather than having old GBS' recollections of himself at age
20, as earlier biographers had, Holroyd said he had access to
letters Shaw wrote at the time.
   ``What Shaw wanted from biography was an endorsement for his
political opinions. He didn't want to seem freakish, eccentric,
odd, with an illegitimate background which might make his socialism
merely a tributary or an eccentric growth or, itself,
illegitimate,'' the British writer said on a recent visit to New
York.
   Illegitimacy was a gnawing issue in Shaw's childhood in Dublin.
His father, George Carr Shaw, was a drunken ne'er-do-well; the
family household was run by George Vandeleur Lee, a voice teacher
and choral conductor who had befriended Shaw's mother. The menage
was doubly scandalous because Lee was a Roman Catholic while the
Shaws were Protestants.
   Shaw grew up unloved by father or mother, a circumstance he
later said admirably equipped him for the world.
   ``He himself said he had the choice to make a tragedy of them or
a comedy. He made a comedy; people laughed, but they didn't
understand always that Shaw's ideas came in the form of jokes. And
then you have to unravel the joke to find the serious content,''
Holroyd said.
   ``My theory was that he orphaned himself from his parents and
made himself the child of his writings. He believed that he
inherited from his parents qualities that were so incompatible as
to drive them to live in different countries, and that his quest in
life was to find some reconciliation for those opposites that he
had inherited.
   ``I believe that the great debates in his plays are the
negotiations for that peace treaty in himself, as it were.''
   Holroyd began the Shaw project by immersing himself in the
subject's works.
   ``It took me, I would say, at least two years to break the code
of his language, of his jokes, to understand, to attune myself.
After 18 months, I was in some despair about this: Would I, could
I, tune in to him? Or he to me?''
   The research is now mostly done, Holroyd said, and he's relieved
to be in contact with readers once again. If he attempts another
biography after this, he said, he would prefer someone who didn't
live so long _ Shaw was 94 at his death.
   ``There have been times when I would have been tempted to kill
him off at the age of say 75 _ a very reasonable age _ rather than
go on to his mid-90s,'' Holroyd said.
   ``I've been tempted to think that when he went to Russia in 1931
I could, when I come to that point, suggest that the Russians
substituted a replica Shaw, filled this replica Shaw with a great
deal of Soviet propaganda which I needn't bother about, because
it's not the real Shaw.
   ``I could stop my narrative then, on his 75th birthday, which he
celebrated, I think, in Moscow, and just add an appendix which
would appeal to John le Carre fans _ and get me extra sales.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: He Went to Moscow to Record Album</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Obscure country music performer Bobby
Joe Ryman says he was honored as a ``little country boy'' to be
picked to do an album as the lone American singer on the only
Soviet record label.
   The 47-year-old Ryman, who performs nightly at a Nashville
restaurant, recorded the album ``Country Boy in Moscow'' in the
Soviet Union in early September.
   He's been told the record could sell up to 5 million copies when
it is released in the Soviet Union early next year. That's
considerably more than he sells at the Melrose House restaurant
where he peddles his cassette tapes for $6 to audiences no larger
than 200 per meal.
   His pictures sell for $2. He has a ``tip hat'' at the front of
the stage for customers to show their special appreciation of his
music.
   ``For a little country boy like me, I felt honored,'' he said as
he reflected on his eight-day visit to the Soviet Union.
   Melodyia Records of Moscow chose him in January to become the
only United States singer on the Soviet record label. Melodyia
officials heard him perform at a music industry convention in
Cannes, France, where he was singing to try to stir up some
overseas bookings.
   Within a few days, the Soviets had decided to add the
silver-haired former building contractor to their roster. Eight
months later, he traveled to the Soviet Union under his first
recording contract with a record label.
   ``It feels wonderful, great,'' he said about his selection.
``It's a dream. I couldn't sleep. You just don't have the words to
explain it or why it happened.''
   He and a dozen American musicians, backup singers and record
producer Stan Cornelius flew to Moscow where they were joined by
Soviet singer Laima Vaikule who also performed on the album.
   Songs on the album include ``To All the Girls I've Loved
Before,'' ``Singin' the Blues,'' ``We Could'' and ``She's Not You.''
   ``To All the Girls I've Loved Before'' was a hit by Willie
Nelson and Julio Iglesias. ``Singin' the Blues'' was recorded by
the late country star Marty Robbins. ``We Could'' was a hit by
Little Jimmy Dickens and later Charley Pride, and ``She's Not You''
was one of Elvis Presley's records.
   It has not been determined yet if the album will be available in
this country.
   Ryman and Vaikule also did a music video to accompany the song
``We Could.''
   ``That was the highlight of the trip,'' Ryman said as he counted
proceeds at the restaurant. ``My heart pounded.''
   He also remembers with special fondness the remarks of the
Soviet video crew. ``The greatest thing said to me was when they
said I should be the ambassador of love and goodwill. That was an
honor.''
   He recorded mostly in English but learned a little Russian. The
new language was one of the difficulties of the joint project.
   ``It was hard for me,'' Ryman recalled. ``I can't speak English
too well, let alone Russian.''
   An interpreter was provided to aid communication.
   ``I found that if you get the younger Russians looking at you,
and you talk pretty good to them, they'll understand.''
   Ryman, a native of Nashville, personally financed his previous
album, ``The Seven Faces of Bobby Joe.'' Prior to that, he spent 28
years remodeling homes. One of his goals is to sing on Nashville's
Grand Ole Opry, the country music show that's been presented since
1925.
   The trip to Moscow left him with memories far surpassing any he
developed as a contractor. He visited Red Square and was the
subject of a documentary on Soviet television. He may return next
year to do a six-week concert tour with Vaikule.
   ``It was a beautiful experience,'' he said. ``The people were so
warm and loving. No one can come up with the words to describe the
Russian people. When they come up and put their arm around you and
say, `I love you,' it's amazing.
   ``They hated to see us leave. People were crying at the
airport.''
   Vaikule, described by Cornelius as a pop singer and dancer,
plans to come to Nashville later this year to record.
   ``She'll take the spotlight here like I did there,'' Ryman said.

   Oil futures prices have tested lows not seen in
two years amid indications that Saudi Arabia might boost their
output to try to pressure other OPEC oil producers to restrict
production.
   The November contract of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude skidded 31 cents a barrel Monday to settle at $13.06 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude prices had not
closed that low since August 1986.
   The price of crude has skidded $2 a barrel over the past five

   Knight-Ridder Inc. says it plans to sell its eight

   Knight-Ridder, which also owns 30 daily newspapers, had acquired
the television stations in four separate transactions over the past

   The National Association of Securities Dealers
says that despite its opposition to market-wide trading halts, the
group would go along with one at the request of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Although the NASD, which governs the over-the-counter stock
market, repeated its objections in detail, the new position by its
board of governors on Monday is seen as removing an important
obstacle to SEC approval of a proposed one-year experiment with a
trading halt rule.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Surge; Oil Prices Continue To Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices have declined to levels not seen since August
1986 and the government has reported a strong rise in factory
orders, signaling what some experts say will be continued
non-inflationary growth for the U.S. economy.
   The jump in factory orders reported Monday by the Commerce
Department indicates the economy continues expanding at a healthy
clip, while lower oil prices should dampen the inflation that
accompanies rapid growth, economists said.
   But experts cautioned that consumers probably would not benefit
significantly from the drop in crude oil prices unless they
remained at the currently depressed levels for an extended period.
   Oil prices have skidded $2 a barrel over the past five weeks to
their lowest point since August 1986. On Monday, the November
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
fell 31 cents to $13.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods surged 3.1
percent in August, the Commerce Department said.
   Although factory orders tend to swing erratically from one month
to the next, analysts said the underlying trend is strong.
   ``There has been some question in the (financial) markets as to
whether manufacturing is stalling out. ...But with the orders
situation as strong as it is, it's clear to us manufacturing
remains on a solid track,'' said Stephen S. Roach, an economist
with Morgan Stanley & Co. ``I think the economy as a whole is
continuing to display very good momentum.''
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said members of his trade group remained optimistic,
at least for the rest of 1988.
   ``Manufacturers in general don't see any slowdown in their
orders over the next three to four months,'' he said.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
7.65 to 2,105.26 in light trading on Monday. Bond prices rose,
while the dollar weakened.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending in August fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $396.1 billion.
   Economists said rising interest rates and high vacancy rates for
many kinds of buildings have kept this sector sluggish.

<HEAD>Scherer Board Taps Banking Firm to Look into Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forces trying to keep R.P. Scherer Corp. off the
auction block may have have lost a round in their fight as the
company's board of directors takes a step toward a possible sale.
   On Monday, the gelatin capsule maker announced its board voted
unanimously Friday to hire the investment banker Goldman, Sachs &
Co. to look into a variety of alternatives, including sale of the
company to a third party or to management.
   For months, the board has been involved in a fight over control
of the company, split between forces backing President and Chief
Executive Officer Peter Fink, who has opposed any sale, and
dissident shareholders led by his estranged wife, Karla Scherer
Fink, who also is the daughter of the company's late founder.
   The dissident group also successfully blocked several management
stock-option proposals. Mrs. Fink controls about 33 percent of the
company's shares.
   A proxy fight over the issue last August, in which the
dissidents ousted at least one director who opposed their plans,
has spilled over into the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where
Scherer is incorporated.
   Scherer spokeswoman Jayne Colombo declined to say Monday whether
the vote by Fink and others to explore a possible sale represented
a shift in their positions.
   Analyst Dean Gulis of William C. Roney & Co. of Detroit said the
decision could represent such a move, but he also said recent
action in the over-the-counter market, where Scherer stock is
traded, ``represented a very attractive price for this stock.''
   During the past several months, while the corporate wrangling
has been going on, Scherer stock has been trading in the mid- to
upper-$20 range.
   Scherer stock closed at $28.75 a share on Monday, up 25 cents
from Friday's close in national over-the-counter trading.
   ``I think it (Friday's decision) is just a recognition that,
`OK, we have a big chunk of the stock that wants to sell the
company and fine, let's see if we can sell the company,''' Gulis
said.
   Friday's vote by 10 board members did not include a ballot from
one board member, whose seat is in dispute.
   In addition to sale, the board said in a news release the firm
would look into merger and recapitalization. Fink said the decision
to hire Goldman, Sachs did not mean necessarily that the company
would be sold.
   The board is to meet again Oct. 25 and will review findings of
the firm's investigation.
   Pending before the court in Delaware are complaints by directors
John Scherer, Frederick Frank and Theodore Souris, who have said
they favor selling the 2,800-employee company, and Peter A. Dow,
who has backed keeping the company. Dow, who was running for
re-election, said some votes for him were not counted in the August
board election.
   Also on Monday, Fink announced that Scherer Chairman Wilber
Hadley Mack, 78, had retired after serving as the company's
chairman since January 1980. In the announcement, Fink said Mack
would remain on the company's board and a member of its executive
committee.

   The U.S. Export-Import Bank, by guaranteeing
commercial banks' loans to Third World countries, may be able to
encourage banks to step up financing world trade, the government
bank's president, John A. Bohn Jr., told Congress.
   ``U.S. commercial banks ... have turned away from supporting
exports to large segments of the globe,'' he said in remarks
prepared for delivery today to the subcommittee on exports of the
House Committee on Small Business.
   Some bankers say they will only make more loans to the Third
World _ which already owes over $1.2 trillion to banks and has
fallen far behind on repayments _ if they get government guarantees.
   At last week's meeting of the International Monetary Fund in
Berlin, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and other Western
leaders came out strongly against shifting responsibility for risky
loans to the shoulders of governments and their taxpayers.
   For the year that began Oct. 1, Congress has authorized the
Export-Import Bank to make only $695 million worth of direct loans
but to guarantee $10.2 billion in loans by private banks.
   Bohn explained that commercial banks now have more stringent
rules to make sure that they have enough capital for international
loans and that they have set aside enough reserves to protect their
depositors. So commercial banks have little appetite or capacity to
take risks in some countries, he added.
   Many banks have dropped out of trade finance altogether, others
will only help their biggest and best customers, he noted. Bohn
would like to encourage small American businesses to export more.
   He said a Los Angeles commercial bank recently approved a $15
million line of credit for the Los Angeles Local Development Corp.
to make working capital loans that may be guaranteed by the
Export-Import Bank.
   ``We believe this ... may show the commercial banking community
a way to participate once again profitably in trade finance,'' Bohn
said.

   The stock market edged lower today, extending
its decline of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 14 points
over the past two sessions, was off another 0.71 at 2,104.55 after
30 minutes of trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of about 5 to 4
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 377 up,
488 down and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.48 million shares at 10 a.m.
on Wall Street, compared with 16.51 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   Stock investors have taken a cautious approach to the market in
recent weeks as they try to project what lies ahead for the economy.
   While recent economic reports have indicated growth is
proceeding at a moderate pace, some concerns remain that growth
could stimulate inflation.
   That has served to limit stock price gains, as it is widely
expected that the Federal Reserve would encourage higher interest
rates if inflation appeared to pick up.
   Higher rates make returns on fixed-income investments such as
Treasury notes and bonds more attractive compared with stocks.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Manville was up \ at
2, Phelps Dodge was up 1{ at 42{, Zayre was unchanged at 26\ and
Coca-Cola was off \ at 42~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.20 at 153.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite
market index was down 0.14 at 299.86.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.65 to
2,105.26.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 527 up, 947 down and 445 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 130.38 million shares, against 175.75
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Grand Met Offers $5.17 Billion For Pillsbury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. says it was caught by surprise
when the British giant Grand Metropolitan PLC launched a
$60-a-share takeover bid for the food conglomerate.
   The offer would be worth about $5.17 billion based on
Pillsbury's roughly 86.2 million common shares outstanding.
   It was first outlined in an advertisement in today's New York
Times and discussed later by Grand Met officials at a London news
conference.
   Craig Carver, an analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis,
said the bid was ``a heck of a good offer,'' but other analysts
predicted other offers might surface.
   ``I would say top dollar is in the $70 (a share) range. This
just might be the first volley,'' said Stephen Carnes, an analyst
wth Piper Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis.
   Pillsbury stock closed at $39 a share Monday, up $1.12{ on New
York Stock Exchange. Trading in Pillsbury was delayed today, but
there were indications the stock would open above $57 a share.
   Johnny Thompson, a Pillsbury spokesman, said Pillsbury's
management was not approached by Grand Met and that he only learned
of the offer after being contacted by the news media late Monday.
   ``We've received nothing and we've been contacted by no one,''
Thompson said, ``and until something like that happens we're in no
position to make a comment.''
   Clive Strowger, chief executive of Grand Met's food division,
said the company launched the surprise bid because ``there was no
indication that its (Pillsbury's) management was interested in
receiving a friendly approach.''
   At the London news conference, Grand Met officials said Ian
Martin, chief executive of Grand Met's U.S. operations, had
traveled to Minneapolis and hoped to meet with top Pillsbury
management later today.
   ``We are prepared to enter into negotiations immediately with
respect to all aspects of our proposal, including price,'' Martin
said in a letter delivered today to Pillsbury Chairman Philip L.
Smith.
   Pillsbury, the nation's fourth-largest food conglomerate,
produces Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs ice creams and Van de
Kamp's frozen fish. Its restaurant operations include the Steak &
Ale and Bennigan's chains.
   The offer by Grant Met, a diversified food, retailing and hotel
company that is the world's largest spirits company, was
conditioned on a majority of Pillsbury shares being tendered, on
Pillsbury shareholders approving the merger and the Pillsbury board
of directors invalidating the company's takeover defenses.
   Grand Met said it began litigation on Monday in Delaware
Chancery Court seeking to invalidate Pillsbury's ``poison pill''
takeover defense, which would make an unsolicited merger
prohibitively expensive.
   Pillsbury has been the target of lively takeover speculation in
recent months, due to management turmoil and sagging earnings that
have helped depress its stock price.
   The company, which gets about half of its total revenue from its
restaurant operations, including the troubled Burger King fast-food
chain, has been attempting to rebound from the impact of a
restructuring that caused its profit to fall to $69.3 million in
fiscal 1988, on sales of $6.2 billion.
   The profit decline stemmed largely from a restructuring charge
associated with the sale of its Godfather's Pizza chain and a
number of other restaurant operations and consolidations.
   Pillsbury tapped Smith, the former chairman of rival General
Foods Corp., as its new chairman in July. He replaced William H.
Spoor, who came out of retirement earlier this year to run the
company on an interim basis after former chairman John Stafford
resigned under pressure.
   In his letter to Smith, Martin said Grand Met would make
Minneapolis the world headquarters of the company's international
foods group.
   He also said Grand Met sees ``great promise in (the) Burger King
business,'' which has ``great prospects for improved profitability
in the United States and for expansion in ... international
markets.''
   Pillsbury management has been under pressure to either boost
sagging revenues at Burger King or divest the unit, which is the
world's second-largest restaurant chain.
   Grand Met, with annual sales of about $10 billion, makes
Smirnoff vodka and J & B Scotch and has interests in food,
retailing and hotels. Its other businesses include Alpo petfood and
Pearle vision centers.
   Last Friday the company announced the sale of its
Inter-Continental hotel chain to Seibu Saison Group of Japan for
$2.27 billion in cash, from which it expected to net about $845
million after taxes. Grand Met said it planned to use the procceds
for further acquisitions.
   ``Pillsbury has strong, powerful consumer brands, and that is
something very dear to our hearts,'' Grand Met Chairman Allen
Sheppard told the London news conference.
   The company has said its strategy is to focus on foods, liquor
and retailing and to expand its operations in North America.
   Grand Met currently is embroiled in a contested bid for Irish
Distillers Group PLC, Ireland's leading whisky maker, for which
Grand Met has offered around $465 million.

<HEAD>Hollywood Film Company Says It Will Take Part in $300 Million
Venture</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MOSCOW (AP ) _ A Hollywood film and investment company says it
has agreed to fund half of a $300 million trade-culture-sports
complex at an unidentified Moscow location in a joint venture with
a Soviet cooperative.
   FresFilm has been assured that it will be able to take its
profits from the project out of the Soviet Union in foreign
currency, president Tom Meehan told a Tuesday news conference at
the Union of Cinematographers.
   Soviet restrictions on removing foreign currency stymie many
joint ventures. Companies can earn millions of rubles selling
long-sought Western goods in the Soviet Union, but find it
extremely difficult to convert that fortune into a currency that
has a value on the world market.
   The complex to be built by FresFilm and Cooperative Circle, its
Soviet partner, will start with a small store and then a hotel for
foreigners, Meehan said. He believes hard currency earned from the
foreigners at the hotel will permit repatriation of his group's
profits.
   Eventually, the joint venture's projects are to include a
world-class arts center, sport facilities, conference halls, a
library, an amusement park, an art gallery and a television studio,
Meehan said.
   FresFilm, which is headquartered in Hollywood, Calif.,
previously agreed to produce four movies with Soviet government
film studios, including one on Napoleon's invasion of Russia.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has approved a reorganization plan
for Placid Oil Co., owned by the trust estates of the Hunt brothers
of Dallas.
   The move, approved Friday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold
Abramson, clears the way for the settlement of a two-year dispute
between the Hunts and their lenders over $1.5 billion in bank loans.
   William Herbert Hunt, Nelson Bunker Hunt and Lamar Hunt and 17
of their creditor banks proposed the plan, which had been
previously announced.
   It calls for $663 million in payments and a seven-year note for
$140 million, which will be secured by profits from producing
properties.
   The Hunts have paid $223.5 million and will raise another $200
million through the sale of their interest in the downtown Dallas
office building Thanksgiving Tower and Placid's stake in the Black
Lake natural gas field in Louisiana. A 10-year loan with Dutch
banks and secured by the Hunts' North Sea oil and gas operations
will raise another $240 million.
   The transactions are expected to close in several weeks,
completing the settlement and releasing Placid from Chapter 11
bankruptcy, a Hunt spokesman said.
   The other half of the Hunts' $1.5 billion in bank debts was
settled last month, when a separate reorganization plan was
approved for the three Hunt trusts, the former sole owners of
Penrod Drilling Co.
   Under that $750 million settlement, the Hunt trusts were
discharged from Chaper 11 bankruptcy.
   Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt filed personal bankruptcy petitions
last month after losing a $134 million federal court judgment in
connection with silver transactions they made in the late 1970s.

   McDonald will join the board of Gould NavCom Systems Inc., a

unit is a major defense contractor.
   C. David Ferguson, 46, a 25-year veteran of the company, was
named Monday to replace McDonald. He was most recently executive
vice president of Gould's materials and components division.
   The company also announced today it was moving its corporate
headquarters from the Chicago suburb of Rolling Meadows to
Eastlake, Ohio, near Cleveland, where most of Gould's remaining
properties are located. The relocation is expected to be completed
in 1990 and include the addition of about 25 jobs.
   Gould already has divested itself of most of its defense units.
It continues to own Navcom, which is tied up in a dispute with the
federal government over a fixed pricing contract.

<HEAD>Harvard Economics Professor Emerges As Key Dukakis Adviser</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Personal File-Boskin</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The day after Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis unveiled an innovative student loan
program, Harvard economist Lawrence H. Summers was quoted in
newspapers around the country explaining how it would work.
   It wasn't a coincidence. Summers, one of the nation's top young
economists, has emerged as a point man in a coterie of outside
advisers to the Massachusetts governor in his bid for the White
House.
   Summers is there when the candidate needs an economic position
paper or a quick assessment of what the latest unemployment figures
mean.
   And as the candidate's staff enters the final weeks of the
campaign against Vice President George Bush, Summers is one of a
handful of policy experts _ ``eggheads'' _ called upon daily to
help shape positions and strategy.
   ``When we hit an issue, we think who are the best people we can
turn to,'' said Robert J. Shapiro, deputy issues director for
economics on the Dukakis campaign. ``There are a couple of people
who play a special role in that they are consulted on a wide range
of issues _ certainly Larry is one of them.''
   Summers is a macroeconomic specialist who shares Dukakis' belief
that government should play a larger role in encouraging
investment, promoting business and aiding the middle class _ what
he calls a ``helping hands'' policy to replace the ``invisible
hand'' of the Reagan administration.
   Like other liberal economists, Summers contends that the
enormous national debt amassed in the last eight years makes the
economic prosperity so touted by Republicans nothing more than a
house of cards.
   ``There's a sense of unease,'' Summers said in a recent
interview in his Harvard University office. ``That sense I think is
a more important thing than the feeling of prosperity people have
at the moment. They're aware of the fragility of that prosperity
and the fact that it is borrowed.''
   According to Summers, foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies
will triple this year over last; median family income is around
1969 levels; government spending on the nation's infrastructure is
one-fifth of 1960s levels; support for university research has
dropped 95 percent since 1980; 38 million Americans are without
health insurance; homelessness has tripled under President Reagan.
   ``As a nation we haven't looked to the future and we're in
danger of not being ready when the future comes,'' he said.
   As a surrogate spokesman for the campaign, Summers has become
politically more astute in recent months, stepping up attacks on
Bush and toning down some earlier, more candid pronouncements on
economic issues. Where he once said reducing the deficit requires
higher taxes, now he says of the T-word: ``I think it would depend
on the political and economic situation following the election.''
   Just 33 years old, Summers' credentials are daunting, which
shouldn't be a surprise considering his economics lineage.
   Summers' parents, Anita and Robert, both are professors at the
University of Pennsylvania. And two uncles, Paul Samuelson at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kenneth Arrow at Stanford
University, have won Nobel Prizes.
   Summers graduated from MIT at age 20 and earned his doctorate
from Harvard in 1982, a year before joining the faculty at age 28.
Last year he became the first social scientist to receive an annual
$500,000 National Science Foundation award.
   Before coming to Harvard, Summers spent 10 months on the staff
of the President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, an
experience he said left him disillusioned.
   ``There was less emphasis on helping everyone in the country
rather than meeting the needs of the privileged few,'' he said of
the Republican assignment.
   Like other members of Dukakis' kitchen cabinet, Summers became
involved in the campaign through Harvard connections. He had
tutored Jack Corrigan, the campaign's operations director, who last
year recommended tapping Summers.
   With just three economists and about 30 recent college
graduates, the campaign's economics staff relies on outside
advisers in business, government and the private sector on Beacon
Hill, Capitol Hill and Wall Street.
   In addition to Summers, key figures include Robert Rubin, vice
chairman of the investment firm Goldman, Sachs & Co.; Rudy Oswald,
head of economic research for the AFL-CIO; Robert Reich, the
iconoclastic professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government;
and Dan Tarullo, a staffer on the Senate Labor Committee.
   ``The point of talking to Larry and lots of other people is to
be sure we get it right, to be sure that we've seen all the aspects
of an issue and that we understand it correctly,'' Shapiro said.
``We're looking for more than a sound bite on the news. We're
thinking about how best to govern this country and that's serious
business. So we use serious people.''
   Summers helped develop the financing features and then publicly
explained the college loan plan proposed by Dukakis last month.
Designed to aid middle-income families, the program allows students
to repay loans by withholding a small, fixed percentage of income
over a lifetime.
   ``Larry was one of the people involved in pulling together the
details,'' said Dukakis issues director Christopher B. Edley Jr., a
Kennedy School graduate and Harvard law professor. ``He took a lead
in getting in touch with people, other economists, and in thinking
through the financing mechanisms.''
   Edley said Summers, unlike other eggheads, has an ability ``to
push a button and stop being an academic professor.''
   ``He's been remarkably helpful at working on speech lines or
thinking about events to communicate the message,'' he said. ``He's
been surprisingly good in ways one might not think an academic
would be.''
   Moreover, Summers has been willing to take on assigned tasks,
answer calls at all hours and provide viewpoints that may differ
from his own.
   ``It's easy enough to find somebody who has a lot of stature and
smarts who'll be happy to spend a day briefing the governor on how
to be leader of the free world,'' Edley said. ``It's harder to find
someone who is willing to get their hands dirty.''

<TEXT>
   When Ronald Reagan was preparing to debate
Jimmy Carter in 1980, Stanford University economist Michael J.
Boskin had a background role as a practice questioner.
   One administration later, Boskin is providing some answers for
George Bush in his drive for the presidency.
   Boskin, 42, is by all accounts ready to follow Bush to the White
House in January to collect the reward due a highly regarded,
staunchly loyal Republican economist. The influential chairmanship
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers may await if Bush
wins.
   ``Michael is right there at the top'' of the hierarchy of
campaign advisers, said Mark Goodin, Bush's deputy press secretary.
``He is very heavily involved in advising the vice president on a
wide range of economic issues.''
   Boskin's most notable contribution to the campaign is a proposal
he helped to shape for dealing with the federal budget deficit. The
so-called flexible freeze would hold federal spending, except for
Social Security benefits, to the levels of the 1989 budget plus
inflation.
   The political beauty of the plan is that it doesn't commit Bush
to any specific budget cuts. Individual programs would not have to
be frozen, but additional spending in any category would have to be
balanced by reductions in other programs.
   This summer Boskin was quoted widely as saying it could
eliminate the $150 billion deficit, which he sees as the nation's
most pressing economic problem, in four years. But he contended in
a recent interview only that it would achieve the task ``over the
next few years.''
   ``It will depend partly on how the economy does,'' he said. ``I
never said it would entirely eliminate the deficit by 1993.''
   It is that caution and sense of what is both ``eminently do-able
and sound economics,'' as he describes the conditional freeze, that
has earned Bush's trust.
   As part of his growing campaign duties, Boskin now flies around
the country briefing reporters and audiences on the vice
president's proposals. He also prepares position papers and reviews
the proposals of other economists.
   Last May, he was one of a group of experts who visited Bush at
his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to plot economic strategy. Among
others at that meeting was Martin S. Feldstein, former chairman of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, who also remains a
high-profile economic adviser to Bush.
   Boskin, like his counterpart in the Democratic camp, Lawrence
Summers of Harvard University, is at ease mixing economics and
politics.
   ``What's especially good about Michael is that he's had some
practical experience and has a good idea how the world works,''
said Martin Anderson, former domestic policy adviser to Reagan and
Boskin's colleague at the Hoover Institution.
   ``He has an excellent reputation as an economist, and he also
has an idea of the reasonable political thing to do,'' he said.
   A native of New York, Boskin moved to Los Angeles with his
family when he was 6. His father was working as a construction
contractor, his mother as a bookkeeper and then an accountant.
   He studied economics at the University of California at
Berkeley, where he was named the outstanding graduate of the class
of 1967.
   Boskin wrote his dissertation on the effects of welfare and
other income-maintenance programs on the size of the labor force,
winning the National Tax Association's award for outstanding
doctoral dissertation.
   He is described by Anderson as a hard-line Republican, but at
Berkeley in the tumultuous '60s Boskin was known as quite liberal.
   ``I was sympathetic with the goals _ freedom of speech, civil
rights _ and I still am,'' he said earlier this year. ``But I was
not sympathetic with the methods,'' such as student sit-ins and
strikes.
   He went from Berkeley to Stanford, where he has been ever since
except for a year of teaching at Harvard a decade ago and brief
periodic consulting jobs for Congress. Besides his unpaid work for
Bush this year, he has been busy writing two books on economics,
teaching a graduate course in fiscal policy and an introductory
economics course, and acting as West Coast director of the National
Bureau of Economic Research, a think tank.
   Boskin minces no words in his criticism of the economic policies
of Bush's campaign foe. He says Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
would foul up ``one of the best growth episodes in the 20th
century'' that has occurred over the past five years.
   ``That includes a huge reduction in inflation and interest rates
and immense expansion of employment,'' he said.
   While he acknowledges that growth in wages has fallen behind the
pace of the 1950s and '60s, he contends that's a by-product of
rapid job growth and says overall living standards have not
declined.
   ``We have the beginning of some major transformations in the
role of government in the economy. We've had success in reducing
marginal tax rates. ... We have to build on what we have,'' Boskin
said.
   Boskin was sharply critical of Reagan's early policies in his
book entitled ``Reagan and the Economy: The Successes, Failures and
Unfinished Agenda.'' But like Bush, who eight years ago brass who
appears on the new ABC sitcom ``Just the 10 of Us.''
   Commercials begin with the Maxie doll at school or with friends,
then switch to Theiss, the ``real-life Maxie,'' in the same
situations, Charness said, calling it ``innovative advertising for
a fashion doll.''
   The company expects to spend about $7 million on Maxie
commercials and live presentations through the end of the year,
Charness said.
   Maxie comes in several variations: three different ``Making
Waves'' dolls, a ``Looking Smart'' doll with skirt, stockings and
boots; and a scented ``Perfect Prom'' doll with pink mini-gown.
Prices range from $5.50 to $13.
   She also has four friends: Ron, her boyfriend; Carly, another
blonde; Ashley, a red-head; and Kristen, who's black. She has a
myriad of accessories, from a cordless telephone to a locker with
built-in shower.
   Hasbro is betting that Barbie has outgrown some of the potential
market among young girls.
   Barbie is older, ``a yuppie if you will,'' Charness explained.
``We felt there was a real need in the market for dolls that are
younger.''
   Maxie is a high school student who does ``the type of things
girls would (imagine doing),'' Charness said.
   But Mattel, the No. 2 toy company, says Maxie, a long-haired,
perpetually smiling teen with lace stockings, white boots and
various hair do-dads, won't even put a dent in the solid success of
Barbie.
   ``This year, we're selling tremendously more dolls, fashions and
accessories,'' said Jocelyn Carter-Miller, director of marketing at
Mattel, based in Hawthorne, Calif.
   She cited ``unprecedented growth,'' but would not provide
specifics.
   ``I don't feel it's a significant threat to Barbie's No. 1
position as a fashion doll,'' Mrs. Carter-Miller said of Maxie.
``She's been in the No. 1 position for 29 years, and this year is a
record year.''
   And Barbie is not just an executive yuppie, Mrs. Carter-Miller
said, but a teen-ager as well.
   ``Barbie represents everything, from being a teen-ager up to a
doctor,'' she said.
   Barbie, introduced as a teen-age fashion doll in 1959, was an
airline stewardess in the 1960s and 1970s, a registered nurse,
fashion editor, astronaut and skin diver in the 1960s, and a doctor
in the early 1970s.
   ``She has been able to be ageless. That's something that makes
Barbie very special and makes her existence difficult to compete
with,'' Mrs. Carter-Miller said.
   Industry analyst David Liebowitz of American Securities in New
York, although noting that Maxie can wear Barbie's clothes, said
Maxie could not survive if it were merely a Barbie clone.
   ``What we are seeing now are products that aren't competing
head-to-head with Barbie but are slightly differentiated,''
Leibowitz said.
   Steven Eisenberg of Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York suggested
that Maxie's lower price range could bolster its competitive
position.
   Although basic-issue Barbies can be obtained for as little as
$4, the $13 top-of-the-line Maxie is slightly less expensive than
the comparable Perfume Pretty edition of Barbie, which sells for
$15.
   ``What Hasbro is attempting to do here is to capture a moderate
share of the fashion doll market at a low price range,'' Eisenberg
said.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Japanese Company Form Joint Venture to Sell Cars & Jeeps
in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Motors Corp. and a Japanese
automobile distribution company have formed a joint venture to
market Jeeps and other Chrysler products in Japan, the No. 3 U.S.
automaker said today.
   The agreement is between Chrysler Motors, the car-making arm of
Chrysler Corp., and J. Osawa & Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, which has been
distributing Alfa Romeo in Japan, Chrysler said in a news release.
   The Jeep, which Chrysler acquired in its merger with American
Motors Corp., is one of the best-selling sports utility vehicles in
the United States.
   Osawa, a subsidiary the Seibu Saison Group of automobile
distributors, will hold 85 percent of the new Chrysler Japan Sales
Ltd. Chrysler will hold the remaining 15 percent.
   Chrysler Japan Sales will import 1,200 to 1,300 vehicles during
its first year, Chrysler said. The company will ship to Japan its
Chrysler New Yorker Landau, Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible,
Dodge Daytona ES Turbo sports coupe and Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler
models.
   The vehicles will be sold in Chrysler-Jeep dealerships in Tokyo,
Osaka and Nagoya immediately. During the next year, about 30
independent dealers will be used in other markets.
   Chrysler and Jeep vehicles had been sold in Japan previously
through two independent distributors, which will continue to
operate through the Chrysler Japan Sales dealer network, the
company said.
   ``Although the market for imported cars in Japan is small today,
it reached a record level in 1987 and will grow substantially in
the next five years,'' said Michael Hammes, vice president for
international operations of Chrysler Motors.
   According to figures from the Japanese Automobile Importers
Association Inc., 97,750 cars were imported to Japan in 1987, up 43
percent from the 68,357 cars brought in the year before.
   The number of imported cars in Japan has grown steadily since
1984, the importers association figures show.

   GTE Corp. is moving the general office of its
Telephone Operating Group from Stamford, Conn., but will maintain
corporate headquarters in the Connecticut city, the company said
today.
   James Broadhead, the president of the telephone group, told
headquarters employees today that a new location for the group has
not been selected.
   Speculation on the new location has centered on the Dallas-Fort
Worth area. About 300 of the roughly 1,000 people employed by GTE
in Stamford are part of the Telephone Operating Group, said
Geoffrey Pickard, vice president for public affairs in GTE's
Products and Systems Group.
   GTE has repeatedly denied that the headquarters of the entire
corporation would be moved from Stamford and did so again today.
   The Dallas Morning News, quoting unnamed sources, reported today
that GTE was moving its entire corporate headquarters to
Dallas-Fort Worth after eyeing sites in Tampa, Fla., Thousand Oaks,
Calif., and Westfield, Ind.
   ``It's absolutely not true,'' Pickard said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Sun-Times' editorial staff authorized
a strike after the newspaper's management proposed to cut salaries
by 10 percent.
   Members of the Chicago Newspaper Guild voted 145-4 Monday night
to give union leaders permission to call a strike if contract talks
don't make progress, said reporter Tom Gibbons, guild unit chairman
at the paper.
   No strike date was set, but Gibbons said ``we don't envision
ourselves being at the negotiating table in February with no
movement'' on a contract. Gibbons said both sides will meet again
Friday.
   The Sun-Times issued a statement expressing disappointment with
the vote.
   The newspaper's pay scale is ``second only to The New York
Times, with many staffers earning over $50,000 a year,'' said the
statement, read by spokesman Michael Soll.
   Soll said today he was referring to pay scales fixed in
contracts at newspapers whose editorial staffs are represented by
the American Newspaper Guild. He said he did not know the pay
scales at the rival Chicago Tribune, which is a non-Guild paper.
   ``The Chicago Tribune has reduced its costs, and if we are to
remain competitive, we must reduce our costs,'' Soll said.
   The Sun-Times has offered a three-year contract with salaries 10
percent below current levels in the first year, 5 percent below
current levels in the second year and back to current levels in the
third year, Gibbons said. The paper also is seeking to stop paying
extra money to night workers, he said.
   The guild has asked for a 7.5 percent increase in a one-year
contract, he said.
   Staff at the paper have been working without a contract since
May 31.
   Reporters recently tried to have a byline strike _ removing
their names from stories _ but the Sun-Times said such a move was
illegal.

   Joe M. Henson is stepping down as president
and chief executive officer of Prime Computer Inc. and will be
succeeded after a transition period by former General Electric Co.
executive Anthony Craig, Prime said Tuesday.
   Henson, 55, has been chief executive of the Natick-based
computer maker since November 1981. The company did not give any
reason for his departure, but said he notified the board last year
that he intended to leave. Henson said he has no long-term plans
other than to attend to personal business and take a lengthy
vacation.
   Craig, 43, is stepping in immediately as chief operating
officer, executive vice president and a member of the board. After
a transition of a few months, he will assume Henson's posts,
according to company spokesman Richard Eckel.
   Craig has been president of GE's Information Services Division
since September 1986. He joined that division in 1983 as vice
president of international sales after 17 years as a marketing and
product management executive for International Business Machines
Inc.
   Prime reported earnings of $64.8 million on revenues of $961
million in 1987. The company is projecting revenues of about $1.6
billion this year, with a lage part of the increase resulting from
its $435 million purchase of Computervision Inc. in February.
   The Computervision takeover made Prime second only to IBM in the
market for computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. In May,
Prime announced about 700 layoffs because of job redundancies
associated with the takeover.
   In addition, Prime announced in July that it was withdrawing
from the mini-supercomputer market and taking a $5 million charge
against earnings.

   The stock market languished today in moderate
trading, as a key blue-chip index edged higher while some broader
market measures slipped.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 7.65 points
on Monday and 14 points over the past two sessions, was up 0.36 at
2,105.62 at noontime.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of about 6 to 5
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 545 up,
682 down and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 76.52 million shares at noon on
Wall Street, compared with 64.95 million shares at the same point
Monday.
   ``It's still an uphill battle,'' said Jack Baker, head of block
trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``As long as the bond
market stays here and dollar stays here, we can probably hold at
2,100 (on the Dow Jones industrials).''
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc., said, ``The market may be
drifting, but there are a number of stocks that aren't.''
   He noted Pillsbury was the most actively traded issue on the New
York Stock Exchange today, rocketing 18{ to 57{ after it received a
takeover bid at $60 a share from a British firm, Grand Metropolitan
PLC.
   Seagle said the bid may remind investors that there are some
sizeably undervalued stocks available.
   ``This message ought to again be heard by the street that stocks
in the United States are selling on a lower value basis than the
rest of the world seems to consider fair,'' he said.
   Stock investors here have taken a cautious approach to the
market in recent weeks as they try to anticipate what lies ahead
for the economy.
   While recent economic reports have indicated growth is
proceeding at a moderate pace, some concerns remain that growth
could stimulate inflation.
   Those concerns have limited stock price gains, as it is widely
expected that the Federal Reserve would encourage higher interest
rates if inflation were to pick up.
   Higher interest rates make returns on fixed-income investments
such as Treasury notes and bonds more attractive compared with
stocks.
   Other companies with big food holdings were also up. Philip
Morris was up 1[ at 98[, R.J. Nabisco was up } at 56] and Quaker
Oats was up 1[ at 55[.
   Inco Ltd. rose 2 to 31 after announcing a recapitalization plan
that includes a special dividend of $10 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.04 at 153.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite
market index was down 0.47 at 299.53.

   LTV Corp. said today it plans to sell LTV
Steel Co.'s Ohio-based bar division, in line with its
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws.
   Raymond A. Hay, LTV's chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company wants its steel division to concentrate on flat rolled
and tubular products.
   ``We have concluded that LTV Steel must focus its resources on
its large, modern flat-rolled facilities in order to maintain a
leadership position in production of high quality, value added
steels for critical engineering applications,'' Hay said.
   LTV Steel, based in Cleveland, is a branch of Dallas-based LTV
Corp., a diversified manufacturing company also involved in
aerospace, defense and energy products.
   Hay said the company's third-quarter results will include a
substantial charge against earnings as a result of today's move.
   The bar division, located in Canton, Ohio, employs about 5,400
workers who produce approximately 1.2 million tons of steel
annually.
   LTV Corp. has hired Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to assist in
finding a qualified buyer for the bar division, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community gave a
cautious response Tuesday to a U.S. offer to discuss short-term
measures on world agriculture reform.
   A spokeswoman for the European Commission, acting for the EEC,
said the U.S. offer was an apparent effort to unblock the current
impasse in the Uruguay round of trade liberalization talks.
   The spokeswoman, who requested anonymity, said that the EEC
welcomed any effort to undertake short-term reforms in agriculture,
but it would have to study the U.S. offer, made at a meeting of
trade ministers in Pakistan, and ``see what the U.S. position
means.''
   ``There will be additional discussions on this,'' she said.
   Until now, the U.S. has argued for the long-term elimination of
farm subsidies and resisted pleas for short-term reforms.
   The EEC believes that ending subsidies is unrealistic and
prefers a gradual and less radical approach which would also have
some immediate effect in restoring order to markets in farm
products.

   A group of consumer activists said today it is
resuming a seven-year boycott of the Swiss-based Nestle corporation
because of its promotion practices for infant formula and is
extending the boycott to the U.S.-based American Home Products
   Action for Corporate Accountability accused Nestle and American
Home Products, which it called the largest manufacturers of infant
formula in the world, of distributing free formula through
maternity wards as a prmotional tactic that undermines the practice
of breast-feeding.
   Representatives of Nestle and AHP have rejected the accusations
and said they were complying with World Health Organization and
individual national codes on the subject.
   ``After the World Health Assembly passed its resolution calling
for an end to the industry practice of dumping formula supplies in
hospitals and maternity wards almost 2{ years ago, we assumed that
Nestle and the other formula manufacturers would abide by the
resolution,'' Janice Mantell, the executive director of Action for
Corporate Accountability, said in a news release.
   ``Since that time, we have been patiently meeting with the
companies, and writing to the companies and waiting for them to
change the dangerous promotional tactic. ... The hard fact is that
babies are dying as the companies are violating the WHA
resolution.''
   She said her group asked Nestle and AHP to present a plan for
ending their supplies programs by today. ``Neither company has
produced one,'' she said. ``We have no other recourse but to ask
for public support of a boycott against these two companies.''
   The boycotts will focus on two products from each company, ACA
said. The Nestle boycott will focus on Taster's Choice Instant
Coffee, and Coffeemate Non-dairy Coffee Creamer. Coffeemate is a
product of Carnation, which is a wholly-owned Nestle subsidiary.
The AHP boycott will focus on Anacin aspirin and the Advil brand of
ibuprofin, a pain reliever.
   Action for Corporate Accountability, based in Minneapolis,
Minn., is the successor of groups that organized a boycott against
Nestle from 1977-1984 in the United States and nine other
countries. The groups halted the boycott after Nestle agreed to
comply with the World Health Organization Code.
   Action for Corporate Accountability said its ``evidence reveals
systematic corporate dumping of large quantities of baby milk on
Third World hospitals, which violates national law in some
countries, and defies World Health Organization restrictions on the
marketing of infant formula.''
   ``Through sophisticated promotional techniques, the infant
formula industry persuaded hundreds of thousands of
poverty-stricken mothers in the Third World that formula feeding
was best for their children,'' ACA said. ``As a result, the
industry created a nearly $6 billion market for a product that is
inferior in every respect to breastfeeding. In areas where sanitary
conditions for cleaning bottles are unavailable, water is impure
and the level of income does not permit families to purchase
sufficient quantities of formula for their infants, use of the
product is deadly.''
   Janice Mantell, the executive director of ACA, said that in the
poorest U.S. communities, ``women who have been persuaded not to
breastfeed their infants over-dilute the formula to make the
expensive product last longer. Their infants are, quite literally,
starving as a result.''
   A Washington spokesman for Nestle, Dr. Thad Jackson, insisted
that the company is in ``total compliance'' with national and
international codes. He also specifically denied that the company
is dumping infant formula in foreign hospitals.
   ``We do not dump supplies in hospitals,'' said Jackson. ``We
only supply materials at their request, and in appropriate
amounts.'' He said if the supplies requested by the hospitals for
distribution seems ``excessive then we contact the hospital.''
   AHP spokeswoman Carol Emerling said, ``This whole activity is
based on allegations that we violate the WHO code _ and we flat out
deny it.''
   ``The real issue is infant health. Breast-feeding is best for
infants; we've always said that,'' she said. ``But every infant who
is not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternative
available. That alternative is a scientifically formulated infant
formula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it. And
that is what our infant formula products are.''
   The WHO code permits donations or concessionary sales of formula
for distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes and
says it may not be used for sales promotion.

<HEAD>Chrysler's Eagle Division to Sell Version of Diamond-Star Auto</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   last a few hours   NORMAL, Ill. (AP) _ A four-wheel drive version
of the two-door
sports coupe built by Diamond-Star Motors Corp. will be marketed by
the Eagle Division of Chrysler Motors Corp., a Chrysler executive
says.
   Production of the Eagle four-wheel-drive coupe will begin at
Diamond-Star in May 1989 and it will be introduced by Eagle next
fall, Eagle marketing manager Michael E. Yatsko said Monday.
   Diamond-Star launched production Sept. 1 on the coupe,
generically callresignation of government ministers.
   ``Today, even one death can set off waves of anger and protest
worldwide ... It doesn't always happen but it can,'' Amnesty said,
citing the death in January 1987 of South Korean student Park
Chong-Chol. The death sparked widespread protests that resulted in
the prosecutions of eight police officers and the resignation of
government ministers.
   On the other hand, communist North Korea didn't even reply to
Amnesty International's questions about legal practices, the report
said.
   Among other alleged abuses were reports that Sudanese forces
massacred hundreds of unarmed Dinka tribespeople; the summary
execution by Iraq of hundreds of unarmed Kurds; the disappearance
of hundreds of Peruvian farmers seized by government forces; and
court-ordered executions in China, South Africa and Iran.
   The report alleged politically motivated killings by
pro-government assassins in Brazil, El Salvador and the
Philippines, and arbitrary arrests, torture and killings in Sri
Lanka, Afghanistan and Uganda.
   In Western Europe, Spain was cited for allegedly torturing
Basque separatist prisoners, Britain for failing to publish a
police inquiry into the killings of six unarmed Irish Republican
Army guerrillas in 1982, and France, Italy, Austria, Greece, Malta,
Norway and Switzerland for jailing draft objectors.
   In Israel, the report said, a court permitted the secret service
to use ``a moderate measure of physical pressure'' in interrogating
suspects.
   Iran executed at least 158 people ``although the true number was
probably higher,'' and another 164 people were hanged in South
Africa's Pretoria Central Prison, it said.
   In the Eastern bloc, Amnesty said ``large numbers'' of ethnic
Turks in Bulgaria remained imprisoned under a campaign of enforced
assimilation. In Romania and East Germany, where all prisoners of
conscience were released in amnesties, new arrests were reported of
people exercising their rights to freedom of expression.
   The Soviet Union released 259 prisoners, most of them prisoners
of conscience, but nearly 200 were pardoned under secret decrees
that falsely implied they were criminals and ``hid the fact that
they had been unjustly imprisoned in the first place,'' the report
said.
   Another 300 Soviet prisoners of conscience were held in prisons,
in exile or in psychiatric hospitals, it said.

<DATELINE>GARDENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All of Honda's 1988 model NX650
motorcycles are being voluntarily recalled to repair a defect that
could cause loss of front-wheel braking, the company announced.
   American Honda Motor Co. Inc. said Tuesday that its dealers
would replace front wheel hubs free of charge on all 2,032 of the
motorcycles sold. This is the first year the model has been
produced.
   Under severe use, one or more of the bolts securing the front
brake disc assembly can loosen, the company said, posing a
potential danger of front brake failure. The rear brakes are
unaffected and Honda hasn't had any reports of accidents blamed on
the defect, the company said.
   Owners of the bikes will be notified, or can take the machines
back to their dealers.

   Share prices on the London stock exchange closed
higher Tuesday after recovering from falls sparked by a flood of
major corporate news.
   Traders said the market's early weakness reflected concern about
a 479 million-pound ($812 million) rights issue and bid by Grand
Metropolitan PLC for Pillsbury Co. of the United States and the
government-ordered reduction of the Kuwait Investment Office's
stake in British Petroleum.
   Several dealers were at a loss to pinpoint the drift higher.
   But others said shares recovered amid a lack of selling pressure
and because few bargain hunters took advantage of the market's low
levels.
   Some dealers were encouraged by the fact share prices didn't
fall even further in the morning.
   ``I can see no reason why we're going better, except that we've
simply reversed engines after this morning's slide,'' one equity
salesman said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 4.7
points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 1,807.3, slightly below the day's
best level of 1808.2. The index lost as much as 15.6 points in
early dealings.
   At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up
1.8 points at 1,457.6.
   Volume was still at relatively slack levels, with 440.0 million
shares changing hands, compared with the 337.4 million shares
traded Monday.
   Wall Street was largely overlooked by London players, several
dealers said.
   The market's early weakness reflected concern about the Grand
Met rights issue to fund an unsolicited $5.12 billion tender offer
for Pillsbury, dealers said.
   Shares in Grand Met were among the major movers, falling 32
pence to 454 pence on the news. Grand Met shares were heavily
traded, with stock exchange figures showing 14 million shares
traded by the close.
   Sentiment also turned sour as the British government ordered the
Kuwait Investment Office to sharply reduce its holding in British
Petroleum to 9.9 percent from the current 21.68 percent over a
period of around 12 months.
   The announcement triggered a flurry of heavy trading in British
Petroleum shares.
   Dealers said the decision had been expected, but many analysts
had predicted the Kuwaitis would only be required to reduce their
holding to around 15 percent.
   British Petroleum shares finished unchanged at 237 on volume of
14 million shares, after dropping to a low of 227.

<HEAD>Ramada To Respond to Shareholder Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc. plans to respond in court to a
lawsuit filed by its second-largest shareholder, a company
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Joe Cole, Ramada's vice president of corporate communications,
said the company was refusing further comment on Donald Callender's
suit seeking $371 million in damages.
   Callender, who sold his Marie Callender's Pie Shops to Ramada in
1986 for cash and stock, charged in the suit filed Monday in Orange
County Superior Court in Santa Ana, Calif., that Ramada's directors
shortchanged stockholders and the company by rejecting a
$10-a-share buyout offer from an affiliate of the Hyatt hotel chain.
   The $371 million is the same price HCC Corp. of Chicago offered
last month for all outstanding Ramada stock that it did not own.
HCC is owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago, Ramada's largest
stockholder.
   On Sept. 16, the directors of Ramada rejected that price as
``grossly inadequate and unfair.''
   Randall Waier, an attorney in Santa Ana who represents
Callender, said the suit would permit participation by Ramada's
more than 33,000 shareholders.
   ``My response is, everyone's entitled to their own opinion,''
said John R. Norton III, a Ramada director.
   He said Ramada's directors believed that their rejection of the
HCC offer was in the shareholders' best interests.
   Securities analysts have valued Ramada at $11 to $13 a share. In
the past five years, the high for Ramada's stock has been $11.88,
but Ramada shares have traded as low as $4 in the past year.
Earnings per share have suffered as operating income at Ramada has
fallen during three of the past four years.
   Waier said the suit charges that directors ``breached their
fiduciary duty'' to stockholders in several ways.
   ``We contend that some of the board members are in a conflict of
interest in that they are officers of Ramada and they took their
interests over those of the shareholders,'' he said. ``We perceive
their motivation is to perpetuate themselves in office.''
   Three of Ramada's 10 directors are executives at Ramada. They
are Richard Snell, chairman and president; Paul Rubeli, executive
vice president of the gaming group; and Thomas Martin, executive
vice president of the restaurant group.
   The suit also says the directors used inadequate data in their
decision.
   The board said it based its decision in part on an opinion from
Salomon Brothers Inc., a Wall Street investment company acting as
Ramada's financial adviser. Norton said that the adviser's opinion
was only ``one of the considerations'' but that he was unable to
reveal other sources.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission filing by HCC on Thursday
said that Ramada was considering restructuring and other
alternatives to the Pritzker offer.
   ``If the company's mismanaged, what are they going to
restructure?'' Callender said in a telephone conversation from a
Marie Callender's in Newport Beach, Calif.
   The stockholder's lawsuit is the fourth that Callender has
brought against Ramada. Callender and Ramada have been embroiled in
bitter disagreements during the past year. Both sides are suing
each other over pie royalties and charges of mismanagement.
   In 1986, Ramada entered a five-year contract with Callender's
consulting company to assist the Marie Callender's chain. Several
weeks ago, Callender claimed, Ramada broke off the contract for the
135 restaurants.
   One of Callender's suits, based on what he calls the wrongful
termination of that contract, asks the court to drop restrictions
that require Callender to hold his Ramada stock for five years,
Waier said. Callender wants to sell the stock he received two years
ago in the Marie Callender's deal.

   Stock prices drifted aimlessly today in moderate
activity as a key blue-chip index edged higher while broader market
measures were mixed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 7.65 points
on Monday and lost 14 points over the past two sessions, was up
3.56 at 2,108.82 with two hours left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of about 7 to 6
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 636 up,
703 down and 541 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110.29 million shares at 2 p.m.
on Wall Street, compared with 88.55 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   Stock investors here have taken a cautious approach to the
market in recent weeks as they try to anticipate what lies ahead
for the economy.
   While recent economic reports have indicated growth is
proceeding at a moderate pace, some concerns remain that growth
could stimulate inflation.
   Those concerns have limited stock price gains, as it is widely
expected that the Federal Reserve would encourage higher interest
rates if inflation were to pick up.
   Higher interest rates make returns on fixed-income investments
such as Treasury notes and bonds more attractive compared with
stocks.
   Pillsbury was the most active issue on the NYSE, rocketing 19 to
58 after it received a takeover bid at $60 a share from Britain's
Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Manville rose 1 to 2}. Its reorganization plan appeared to move
a step closer to fruition after the Supreme Court refused Monday to
hear an appeal.
   Inco Ltd. rose 2 to 31 after announcing a recapitalization plan
that includes a special dividend of $10 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.12 at 153.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite
market index was down 0.30 at 299.70.

Two Parts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stockholders of the Sun Co., the nation's
10th largest oil firm, Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a major
restructuring proposal that spins off its $4.2 billion domestic gas
exploration and production into a separate operation and cuts 1,300
jobs.
   At the same time, the new structure retains the refining and
marketing of petroleum into a slimmed-down business.
   Under the plan, adopted at a special meeting in nearby King of
Prussia, shareholders will receive one common share of the new Sun
Exploration & Production Co. for each common share of Sun,
effective Nov. 1.
   Record date for distribution is Oct. 14.
   Stockholders representing less than 1.5 percent of Sun's 106
million outstanding shares opposed the plan, Sun spokesman Ray
Enderle said. He could not provide specific figures.
   In 1987 Sun Co. reported more than $9.1 billion in revenues. It
had some 20,000 employees in the United States and eight other
countries.
   Both new firms plan to reduce employment within a year _ Sun
Exploration trimming 800 from the 4,000 workers it is getting in
the restructuring and Sun Co. cutting approximately 500 from its
headquarters staff.
   Sun Exploration, in the spinoff, will become the largest
independent oil and gas producer in North America, Enderle said. As
an integrated company that combined exploration, production,
refining and marketing, Sun Co. was the 10th largest U.S. oil
company.
   Sun stock has been selling at around $57. It had shot up above
$60 when the restructuring announcement was made last July.
   The stock of each of the new firms is expected to start off at
around $28 to $30.
   ``We were attempting to achieve an increased value for our
shareholders,'' said Fred Huffman, Sun Co. director of investor
relations. ``By becoming two companies the total value of the stock
together will be more than it is alone.
   ``Since July 1 we have outperformed in the stock market other
major oil companies, and it is anticipated that shareholder value
will continue to be enhanced.''
   Andrew Gray III, an oil industry analyst, said he thinks
stockholders will benefit from the spinoff.
   ``You'll have two purer-type companies (and) you will have a
purer play,'' he said.
   Under a previously announced Internal Revenue Service ruling
neither Sun nor its shareholders will incur any federal income tax
liability from the distribution.
   Robert Hauptfuhrer, Sun president and chief operating officer,
will become chairman and chief executive officer of the new
exploration firm that will be based in Dallas, Texas. Robert
McClements Jr., remains chairman and CEO of Sun Co. headquartered
in the Philadelphia suburb of Radnor with assets of around $8.5
billion.
   Sun officials expect the restructuring to produce about $65
million in after-tax savings for Sun Exploration each year and
around $15 million for Sun Co., mostly through payroll reductions.
   Sun has five refineries in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto
Rico and Canada, mines coal in five states and sells gasoline,
under the Sunoco brand, at more than 6,000 stations in 23 states.
   It will add another 1,000 outlets and a Philadelphia refinery
when it completes its recent purchase of the Atlantic Petroleum
Corp. of Valley Forge, Pa.
   Also part of the deal is a 986-mile products pipeline system
that runs from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and into New York state
at Rochester and Tonawanda.

   Saudi Arabia's move to shock fellow
OPEC members into cutting oil output by forcing prices down
undoubtedly will affect Venezuela's ability to service its foreign
debt, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Julio Cesar Gil said
Tuesday.
   Gil told a news conference the current ``price war'' could bring
prices down temporarily to two-year lows of below $10 a barrel.
   ``We are arriving at (price) levels of 1986...Undoubtedly this
will compromise the payment of the debt,'' Gil said.
   He said any decision regarding debt payments would be made by
the Finance Ministry.
   ``I do not know what price level Venezuela can bear,'' Gil said.
   When oil prices fell in 1986, Venezuela called for
renegotiations on its $35 billion foreign debt and stopped making
principal payments on its $20.34 billion of refinanced public debt
while talks were held.
   ``Perhaps prices will reach a level we haven't seen in two
years. This could be encouraging for (OPEC) to arrive at an
agreement'' on curbing output, he said.
   He said Saudi Arabia warned other OPEC members of its decision
to force prices down during the Sept.25-26 meeting in Madrid of
OPEC's price monitoring committee.
   ``We understand Saudi Arabia's desire to bring discipline to the
market through shock treatment but the affects do not please us.''
   He said a joint meeting in the third week of October of OPEC's
long-term strategy committee and the price committee is likely to
last longer than the meeting of the price committee alone.
   ``There are more countries and more matters to discuss,'' he
said. He said the site of the meeting has not yet been decided.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied Tuesday
at the Chicago Board of Trade, bolstered by continued optimism that
a U.S.-Soviet grain agreement is near.
   Export demand also encouraged buying in the corn and soybean
pits, where the underlying strength came from high demand for
soymeal as well as tight supplies, said Joel Karlin, an analyst for
Research Department Inc.
   A forecast for cold weather for much of the Corn Belt led to
anticipation of increased consumption, and also helped support
prices, analysts said. Dry weather, however, was expected to allow
the harvest to progress, and that helped temper gains.
   At the close, wheat was 4{ cents to 5{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26 a bushel; corn was {

oats were 4 cents lower to { cent higher; and soybeans were 6{

   Digital Equipment Corp., in a historic
departure, said Tuesday it will allow Allen-Bradley Co. to
manufacture Digital MicroVax computers as part of an alliance to
serve the industrial automation market.
   Allen-Bradley will build rugged versions of the MicroVax under
license from Digital and package them into systems that will share
information between the factory floor and the other parts of a
company.
   Digital's long working relationship with Allen-Bradley gave it
the confidence to let the company be the first outsider to produce
Digital computers, according to Kenneth Olsen, Digital's president
and founder.
   The alliance is intended to combine the skills of Allen-Bradley,
a Cleveland-based unit of Rockwell International Corp. that
specializes in factory automation equipment, and Digital, which is
based in Maynard, Mass., and specializes in tying computers
together into networks.
   ``No single control company and no single computer company can
do it alone,'' J. Tracy O'Rourke, Allen-Bradley's president and
chief executive, said at a New York news conference.
   There were several other developments in the computer industry
Tuesday:
   _NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.) Inc., the U.S. arm of Japan's NEC
Corp., announced a new line of laptop computers, including the
thinnest, lightest one yet, a 4.4-pound model that could fit into a
12-inch by 9-inch inter-office envelope. The UltraLite has 90
percent of the power of the original IBM PC AT and starts at $2,999.
   NEC's ProSpeed 386 laptop resembles a high-powered machine
introduced a day earlier by Toshiba Corp. except it is cheaper, it
can run on batteries and it has an optional ``docking station'' so
it can be used as a conventional desktop computer in the office. It
starts at $7,699, compared to $9,499 for Toshiba's. _Prime Computer
Inc. of Natick, Mass., said Joe M. Henson is stepping down as
president and chief executive officer and will be succeeded after a
transition period by former General Electric Co. executive Anthony
Craig.
   Henson, 55, has been chief executive since November 1981. The
company did not give any reason for his departure, but said he
notified the board last year that he intended to leave. Henson said
he has no long-term plans other than to attend to personal business
and take a lengthy vacation.
   _Infonet and Minitel USA announced they had formed a joint
venture to operate a domestic and international videotex network
for computer users. The service, to be available in the first
quarter of 1989, will cost 17 cents a minute and will allow people
with personal computers or Minitel terminals to chat, skim
electronic libraries or do business.
   Last month International Business Machines Corp. and Sears,
Roebuck and Co. announced their own videotex venture, called
Prodigy.
   Infonet, based in El Segundo, Calif., runs a worldwide
communications network, while Minitel is an arm of France Telecom.
The joint venture, Minitel Services Co., is based in White Plains,
N.Y.
   _International Business Machines Corp. announced a version of
its Database 2 software, to be available in the third quarter of
1989, that will make it possible for people to get direct access to
information in IBM mainframe computers without having to know which
computer has it.
   Another upgrade from IBM will make it possible to partition
mainframe computers to increase the number and variety of programs
that can run simultaneously.
   _National Semiconductor Corp. and Europe's SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics announced a set of chips for the emerging field of
ISDN, or Integrated Services Digital Network, which will allow
voices, computer data and video signals to be transmitted over
ordinary phone lines.
   In-Stat Inc. has predicted that worldwide sales of ISDN chips
will approach $3.5 billion by 1995, compared with $200 million this
year. National is based in Santa Clara, Calif., while SGS-Thomson
has international headquarters in Paris and Milan, Italy.

<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers in the United States
wound up the 1988 model year on a down note, with domestically made
car and truck sales dipping 9 percent in late September, the
companies said Tuesday.
   But for the 1988 model year, foreign and domestic car makers
were poised on what could be the one of the best years in
automotive sales history.
   During the last 10-day period of the 1988 model year _ Sept.
21-30 _ General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
reported selling 346,948 cars and light trucks, down from the
381,013 vehicles they sold during the same period in 1987.
   There were nine selling days in both periods.
   For the model year, the Big Three reported sales jumped 3
percent, to 10,774,342 vehicles in the period Oct. 1, 1987-Sept.
30, 1988, compared with 10,428,653 cars and light trucks sold
during the 1987 model year.
   There were 308 selling days in the 1988 model year, one more
than the year before.
   At the beginning of the model year, industry analysts predicted
the auto industry would be doing well to sell 15 million cars and
light trucks. But in the last few months of the model year, those
estimates were revised upward to about 15.5 million vehicles _
roughly two-thirds cars and one-third light trucks.
   That would make it the third-best model year on record, behind
the 16 million sold in 1986 and the 15.7 million sold the year
before that, and a few thousand vehicles ahead of the 1987 model
year.
   GM suffered the biggest percentage loss on sales of U.S.-made
cars in late September, dropping 15 percent to 116,028 in the 1988
period compared with 136,483 cars during the same time last year.
   Ford said it sold 70,813 cars in late September, down 14.3
percent from the 82,606 cars it sold during the same period last
year. But for the model year, Ford's car sales were up 2.9 percent,
rising to 2,140,289 in 1988 from 2,073,845 in the the last model
year.
   Sales of Chrysler's U.S.-built cars fell the least among the Big
Three late last month, dropping to 33,314 this year from 34,898
during the period last year, a 4.5 percent decline.

to buy the 37 percent of the British music and entertainment group
they don't already own at $2.37 a share, the same price the shares
were floated at in November 1986.
   The offer values the company at 248 million pounds, the
equivalent of $420.7 million.
   Virgin's founder and chairman, Richard Branson, announced July 7
that he was considering buying back the 50 million shares in the
company that are publicly quoted. He said he wasn't satisfied with
the stock market's valuation of the shares.
   Virgin shares closed at 95 pence ($1.61) on July 6, the day
before the possibility of a management buyout was announced. The
shares have traded as low as 85 pence ($1.44 dollars).
   Following Tuesday's announcement, Virgin shares were up 6 pence
(10 cents) at 133 pence ($2.25) on the London Stock Exchange.
Virgin shares are also traded in American depository receipt form
in the United States.
   The offer for the publicly held Virgin shares will be made by
Glowtrack Ltd., a company formed by Branson and other Virgin
directors for the sole purpose of buying Virgin.
   Virgin announced May 18 pretax profit for the six months ended
Jan. 31 of 14.5 million pounds ($24.6 million), down from 15.2
million pounds ($25.8 million) the year before.
   Virgin Group is separate from Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways,
the cut-rate trans-Atlantic airline which is owned by the privately
held Voyager Group Ltd.

   The stock market finished lower today for the
third consecutive session. Trading was moderate.
   Analysts said worries about interest rates and the outlook for
corporate profits continue to weigh on stock prices.
   But some issues, the most prominent of which are actual or
potential takeover targets, managed to post gains.
   Investors have taken a cautious approach to the market in recent
weeks as they try to anticipate what lies ahead for the economy.
   While recent economic reports have indicated growth is
proceeding at a moderate pace, some concerns remain that continued
growth could stimulate inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to
encourage higher interest rates.
   Higher interest rates make returns on fixed-income investments
such as Treasury notes and bonds more attractive compared with
stocks.
   The market is already looking ahead to the September
unemployment report set for release on Friday for the latest clue
on the health of the economy.

<HEAD>Eastman Kodak Introduces New Color Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. says the new 35mm color
film for consumers introduced Tuesday represents a major
improvement in the quality of color photographs, but stock analysts
said they want some proof.
   Judging the quality of a photograph by looking at it is very
subjective and that's the problem with the new ``Ektar'' color
film, analysts said.
   ``How much sharper is sharper? Without a technical measure, I
can't tell if it's 1 percent better or 10 percent better,'' said
Brian Fernandez of Brean Murray, Foster Securities in New York.
   The new film was introduced at worldwide news conferences
Tuesday.
   Kodak has said only that the results from the new film have to
be seen to be believed, but for some, seeing isn't always believing.
   Eugene Glazer, of Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said the
photos he studied taken with the new film look very good, but how
good is a difficult question to answer.
   ``I've seen plenty of superb pictures and, to a degree, I can
compare them in my head, but without a side-by-side comparison it's
very tough to say this is the best,'' Glazer said.
   Kodak's chief competitor, Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan, had
little to say about the development.
   ``It is our policy not to comment on our competition,'' said
Fuji spokeswoman Carol O'Loughlin in New York.
   ``Ektar'' is an effort by Kodak to develop a color film that was
considered the standard for ``serious amateurs,'' who take about 20
percent of the 40 billion pictures made each year worldwide.
   ``We're not suggesting that everybody use this film,'' said
Wilbur Prezzano, group vice president and general manager of
photographic products. ``We've got a terrific film for the mass
market,'' he said of Kodacolor Gold, which the company introduced
two years ago.
   In fact, the ``Ektar'' film is not available in the speeds that
are most popular in the general market: 100, 200 and 400. Its two
speeds are 25, which is unusually slow, and 1000, which is
unusually fast.
   Other speeds may be added to the line, company spokesman Ronald
Roberts said.
   And Kodak suggests that only owners of 35mm single-lens-reflex
cameras use the film. That suggestion is also printed on every box
of ``Ektar'' film.
   But it's clear that Kodak believes it has made a significant
advance in the field of color photography because the company has
broken several long-standing traditions in its effort to sell
``Ektar'' film:
   _ The film comes in a mostly black box instead of the yellow box
Kodak has put all of its film in since about 1903.
   _ The film has a new name. Since 1942, Kodak has retained the
Kodacolor name on new and improved film, choosing to highlight
advancements by adding a number or letter after the name. Ektar
will be sold along with Kodak's Kodacolor Gold line of films.
   _ The new film will be 15 to 20 percent more expensive than
Kodacolor, which costs about $3.79 for a roll of 24 exposures.
   The new film was made possible by several unique discoveries by
Kodak scientists that improved the performance of color dyes and
reduced the number of color layers on the film, the company said.
   ``Ektar'' film will be available later this month in Europe and
Japan, where Kodak says a majority of the serious amateur
photographers live, and in the United States early next year.
   Prezzano said the new film also sends a message to the
photography industry that the old-fashioned, silver-halide method
of making photographs isn't ready to be replaced by electronic
photography.
   Stock analyst Mark Obenzinger, of Wood, Gundy & Co. in New York,
said Kodak's effort to introduce a premium line of film is a shrewd
marketing measure.
   ``They're trying to differentiate themselves from good ol'
yellow and I think this is just the beginning of it,'' Obenzinger
said. ``This is another tool for the company in dealing with a
maturing market.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed in an active session
Tuesday, but traders attributed the currency's spotty gains to
technical factors rather than fundamental strength.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$397.60 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $396.95 late Monday.
   Traders said the market was inclined to sell dollars, but a drop
in the British pound prevented the U.S. currency from falling
across the board. The dollar posted its best gains on the day
against the pound and the West German mark.
   The British government's decision to order the Kuwaiti
Investment Office to sharply reduce its holding in British
Petroleum Co. PLC sparked speculation that Kuwait might sell
significant amounts of sterling. Those fears worked to weaken the
pound and firm the dollar.
   Separately, the dollar initially seesawed on rumors swirling
around Saudi Arabia's status within the OPEC cartel. Saudi Arabia
has threatened to flood world markets with its crude oil to punish
other oil producing nations that have ignored quotas by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston in New
York, said there also was talk that Saudi Arabia ``might be
dropping out of OPEC. But when those rumors were denied, it brought
the dollar back up.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 133.15 yen from
Monday's 133.90. Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate
of 133.20 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 133.31 yen, down
from 133.68 yen on Monday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6945 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6990 late Monday. In New
York, it cost $1.6952 to buy one pound, less expensive than
Monday's $1.7019.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8646 West German marks, up from 1.8617; 1.5827 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5820; 6.3460 French francs, up from 6.3420;
1,389.50 Italian lire, up from 1,387.00, and 1.2082 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2097.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8610 West German marks, up from 1.8608; 1.5775 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5785; 6.3285 French francs, down from 6.3350;
2.0950 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1010; 1,385.875 Italian lire,
down from 1,397.95; and 1.20965 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2104.
   Gold prices rose on the New York Commodity Exchange to $398.10 a
troy ounce, from Monday's $397.50.
   But in London, gold fell to a late bid price of $397.45 a troy
ounce, compared with late Monday's $397.75. The metal also moved
lower in Zurich, where gold closed at a bid $396.90 an ounce,
compared with $397 late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.32 to close at $402.23 an
ounce.
   Silver prices were unchanged on New York's Comex, closing at
$6.248 a troy ounce. Silver prices rose in London to a late bid
price of $6.23 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $6.22.

<HEAD>Kiley Calls for Increase in Mass Transit's Share of Gas Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment in the nation's mass transit systems
should be doubled and the best way to do it is to earmark more of
the federal gasoline tax, the head of the nation's largest transit
system said Tuesday.
   Only 1 cent per gallon of the federal gasoline tax now goes to
support mass transit and it needs to be at least 7 cents to create
a stable funding base for transit systems nationwide, according to
Robert Kiley, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
   ``In 1987, the auto industry spent $5 billion promoting itself
through television advertising,'' Kiley said. ``That, my friends,
is nearly 25 percent more than we spent on capital improvements for
public transportation.''
   He made his remarks in Montreal at the annual meeting of the
American Public Transit Association, whose members include the
managers of virtually every transit system in this country and
Canada as well as representatives of the businesses that supply the
transit industry.
   The federal gasoline tax, now at 9 cents per gallon, raises
about $9 billion a year, $8 billion of which goes to the interstate
highways. The tax, which was imposed 29 years ago at 4 cents a
gallon, was created solely to finance the building of the
47,000-mile interstate system. It was raised by 5 cents in 1983 and
a penny was earmarked for mass transit.
   With the interstates finished, the federal gasoline tax is to
expire in 1991.
   ``That means that the 9-cent gasoline tax will be up for grabs,
so to speak,'' Kiley said.
   Kiley, speaking as chairman of the Transit 2000 task force, an
APTA committee developing longterm transportation initiatives,
recommended that:
   _The tax be extended.
   _Mass transit retain the penny now reserved for public
transportation.
   _Two cents be added to the gasoline tax to replace the $2
billion in
   transit aid that is subject to federal budget battles each year.
   _Another 4 cents to pay for new buses, subways, and construction
of new rail systems.
   With dedicated taxes to replace the $2 billion that is
appropriated each year, that money could be used to reduce the
federal deficit, Kiley said.
   Kiley said he would seek support for the Transit 2000
recommendation from the National League of Cities and the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.
   Reapportionment of the federal gasoline tax will become a major
issue for the next Congress and president as the nation's great
road building era comes to an end, he said.

<HEAD>Dutch Institutions Offer `White Knight' Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of the largest financial
institutions in the Netherlands announced a plan Tuesday to act
together to help defend Dutch companies against hostile tender
offers deemed to be priced too low.
   The four partners include the two largest Dutch insurers,
Nationale-Nederlanden NV and Aegon NV, the third lartest banking
group, Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV, and the collective pension
funds of the big electronics concern NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken.
   The aim of the venture is ``to prevent quoted Dutch companies
from falling victim to a hostile takeover priced at unacceptably
low levels,'' Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank, as spokesman for the group,
said in a brief statement.
   The group would act only if requested by a company being pursued
in a takeover fight.
   A spokesman said the partners initiated the venture in part to
help protect Dutch companies from forays by foreign companies in
advance of the 1992 deadline for creating a single market
encompassing the 12 nations in the European Economic Community.
   But the white-knight service offered by the four institutions is
not purely of an altruistic nature, but also is seen as a
potentially major profit source, said H.W. Wolf, a spokesman for
the bank.
   The intention of the venture is to defeat hostile tender offers
either through a competing tender offer or on the open market, Wolf
said.
   Shares acquired in that process, however, would not be held as a
long-term investment or for merger purposes by the group. Rather
they would be fairly quickly sold back into the stock market, with
the intention of making a profit on the transaction, Wolf said.

<HEAD>U.S. Manufacturers Getting More Of Sales From Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. companies are getting a growing proportion
of their total sales from exports, according to a survey released
Tuesday by the Conference Board.
   Exports from the United States accounted for 10 percent or more
of total sales at 49 percent of the surveyed companies, compared to
about 40 percent of the surveyed companies in 1986, the Conference
Board said.
   Exports accounted for 20 percent or more of the sales in 19
percent of the companies, up from 14 percent in 1986.
   The survey is based on responses from the 277 companies that
answered the survey out of the 1,800 manufacturers that were
approached. The margin of error is 3 or 4 percentage points,
according to James Greene, who compiled the survey.
   The export gains seem likely to continue, Greene said. However,
he said, U.S. companies are also increasing their overseas
investments. Those investments rose about 18 percent in 1987 to $35
billion, he said.

<HEAD>House Banking Committee Votes to Abolish FADA</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 2nd graf to fix name of FADA</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee voted 42-8 Tuesday
to abolish the much-criticized federal agency created to manage and
dispose of the assets of insolvent savings institutions.
   The Federal Asset Disposition Association was formed by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1985 to assist the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. in the management of acquired assets.
   FADA has been accused by members of Congress of favoritism,
conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the $3.9 billion in
loans and real estate in its care.
   The bill, similar to a section of the omnibus banking
legislation approved by the House in August, would assign FADA's
activities to FSLIC. Since the wide-ranging banking bill has run
into trouble and may not be approved before Congress adjourns this
month, a free-standing measure has a better chance of being passed.
   Reps. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Tom McMillen, D-Md., introduced
the legsilation, which would dismantle FADA within 60 days and
return its functions to FSLIC, the government insurance fund that
backs savings and loan deposits up to $100,000.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., banking committee chairman,
said the panel has been investigating FADA, a quasi-public agency,
for the past 15 months.
   ``Our findings clearly establish that this agency has become a
wasteful bureaucracy, lacking in accountability, and providing an
inefficient means of disposing of property acquired from failed
savings and loan associations,'' he said. ``High salaries, big
expense accounts and CIA-like secrecy have become the agency's
claims to fame during its three-year existence.''
   He quoted the General Accounting Office, in a draft report not
yet released, as concluding that FADA's functions are nonessential.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said, ``In
conclusion, we found no compelling evidence that FADA is essential
to the management and disposition of assets acquired by FSLIC.
   ``Such functions could be done by a combination of other private
sector asset management firms, receivership employees and FSLIC
headquarters and regional employees,'' the GAO said.

   The stock market gave ground Tuesday for the
third consecutive session as concerns about interest rates weighed
on prices and more than offset the scattered gains that resulted
from takeover speculation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, off more than 14
points over the past two sessions, lost another 3.20 points to
close at 2,102.06.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 7-to-6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
658 issues up, 778 down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 157.76 million shares,
up from 130.38 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
184.92 million shares.
   ``It's still an uphill battle,'' said Jack Baker, head of block
trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``As long as the bond
market stays here and dollar stays here, we can probably hold at
2,100 (on the Dow Jones industrials).''
   Bond prices held firm Tuesday while the dollar finished mixed in
foreign exchange trading.
   Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Prescott, Ball &
Turben in Cleveland, said stock prices are suffering because of the
near-9 percent yields available on 30-year Treasury bonds.
   He said investors also face the prospect of more modest
corporate earnings gains for the forseeable future than they saw in
the second quarter.
   On the other hand, he said stocks are drawing some support from
proposed stock buybacks and buyouts and from demand from foreign
investors.
   That was clearly illustrated Tuesday as Pillsbury was the most
active issues on the NYSE, rocketing 18 to 57 after receiving a
takeover bid of $60 a share from Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc., said the bid may remind
investors that there are some significantly undervalued stocks
available.
   ``This message ought to again be heard by the Street that stocks
in the United States are selling on a lower value basis than the
rest of the world seems to consider fair,'' he said.
   Stock investors here have taken a cautious approach to the
market in recent weeks as they try to anticipate what lies ahead
for the economy.
   They are looking toward Friday's scheduled release of the
September unemployment report for the latest shred of evidence on
the economy's health.
   While recent reports have indicated growth is proceeding at a
moderate pace, some concerns remain that even that could stimulate
inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to encourage higher
interest rates.
   Among other active issues Tuesday on the NYSE, Manville rose 1[
to 2~. Its reorganization plan appeared to move a step closer to
fruition after the Supreme Court refused Monday to hear an appeal.
   Inco Ltd. rose 1~ to 30~ after announcing a recapitalization
plan that includes a special dividend of $10 a share.
   Among widely-held stocks, International Business Machines fell ]
to 114{, Eastman Kodak fell [ to 45} and General Electric fell ] to
42~.
   On the American Stock Exchange, Texas Air was the most active
stock, slipping [ to 14\. It announced a $50 million agreement to
allow Scandinavian Airlines System to lease New York area airport
gates and giving SAS the option to buy up to 10 percent of Texas
Air's stock.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $5.17 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE index slipped 0.30 to 152.93.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 0.72 to 310.42, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.76 to 270.62.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.38

<HEAD>Soymeal Demand and Soviet Grain Pact Talks Boost Grain And
Soybeans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied Tuesday at the Chicago
Board of Trade, bolstered by strong demand for soymeal and optimism
that a U.S.-Soviet grain agreement is near.
   On other markets, coffee prices fell further; gold prices
rallied; oil prices reversed their decline; live cattle and hog
prices gained; and feeder cattle and pork bellies were mostly lower.
   Soymeal remains the underlying strength in the soy market, and
helped soybean prices close sharply higher, said Joel Karlin, an
analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Domestic demand remains high for soymeal, and tight supplies as
well as an anticipated increase in exports helped keep prices firm,
he said.
   Export demand also encouraged buying in the corn pit, Karlin
said.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 2\ cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.22{ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to
4{ cents higher, with December at $2.94{ a bushel; oats were 1{
cents lower to 1 cent higher, with December at $2.49\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 11 cents to 13{ cents higher, with November at $8.28
a bushel.
   At New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, coffee prices
continued to feel pressure from the International Coffee
Organization's compromise plan for 1988-89.
   The plan, which includes an initial export quota of 58 million
bags, allows concessions for producers of mild coffee _ the kind
traded at the New York exchange _ and is expected to increase
availability, said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   The plan announced over the weekend calls for a 2-million-bag
reduction, but traders had expected a quota of around 54 million
bags, Badenhop said.
   Coffee settled 1.89 cents to 6 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in December at $1.244 a pound.
   Gold futures prices were higher and silver was mostly higher at
the New York Commodity Exchange.
   Both responded to the higher crude oil price, which had been
down sharply for several days, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   The dollar's weakness and the gains in grains and soybeans _
both causing a rise in inflationary expectations _ also supported
gold prices, she said.
   Gold was 30 cents to 60 cents higher, with October at $398.10 a
troy ounce; silver was .1 cent lower to .2 cent higher, with
October at $6.248 an ounce.
   Crude oil futures steadied in trading at the New York Mercantile
Exchange following their plunge the previous two sessions. But
analysts said concerns about oversupply remained the underlying
factor in the market, and that helped temper gains.
   Crude oil settled 1 cent to 32 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in November at $13.07 a barrel; heating oil was .59
cent lower to .39 cent higher, with November at 38.17 cents a
gallon; and unleaded gas was .87 cent lower to .10 cent higher,
with November at 41.11 cents a gallon.
   Live cattle and hog prices rallied, while feeder cattle and pork
bellies were mostly lower.
   Higher cash bids from meatpackers for live cattle and hogs
sparked a buying spree in the cattle and hog pits, and had a
spillover effect on pork belly prices through the middle part of
the session, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   But ``early buyers turned out to be late sellers,'' he said, and
profit-taking later near the session's close eased earlier gains.
   Live cattle settled .07 cent to .50 cent higher, with the
contract for deliver in October at 72.42 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .42 cent lower to .25 cent higher, with October at
82.15 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent to .67 cent higher, with
October at 39.87 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .37 cent
lower to .93 cent higher, with February at 49.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Bid Accepted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren Bentz on Tuesday
signed an order accepting Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s $20 cash bid for
a modern, idled rail mill that federal lenders seized from
financially troubled Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.
   Bethlehem officials have said they would operate the
Westmoreland County mill in conjunction with Bethlehem's rail mill
in Steelton. But it is not clear when the Monessen plant might be
reactivated.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh closed it because of slack demand for
transportation rail.
   The transfer of the property could face a legal hurdle, however.
Attorney Ken Simon said in Pittsburgh that Monessen and its school
district will appeal to U.S. District Court to block the deal
unless Bentz's order provides for the payment of several hundred
thousand dollars in delinquent property taxes.
   The order addresses the tax issue, but the exact terms will not
be available publicly until the document is filed in bankruptcy
court in Pittsburgh as early as Wednesday, according to Bentz's
office.
   The U.S. Economic Development Administration foreclosed on the
rail mill after bondholders forced the agency to pay $90 million in
principal and interest. The EDA had guaranteed a loan to
Wheeling-Pittsburgh for the construction of the mill and pollution
controls at three sites, including Monessen, said EDA spokeswoman
Elaine Dudley.
   The Monessen project was one of five steel industry projects
that soured for the federal lending agency, she said. Of five
companies that participated in the Steel Loan Program in the late
1970s, three no longer exist and the remainder, Wheeling-Pittsburgh
and LTV Steel Co., are reorganizing under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws.

<TEXT>
   The world's largest dictionary of the English
language will be published five months from now and everyone who is
interested will want to have one _ if they can pick it up.
   The second edition of ``The Oxford English Dictionary'' _ known
to word buffs as the OED _ will have 22,000 pages, fill 20 volumes,
weigh 137 pounds (62.5 kg) and be priced at about $2,500.
   ``We are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the
standard work of reference on the English language and any
substantial library will have to have it,'' said Ludo Craddock,
promotions executive of the Oxford University Press.
   The publishing house, founded in 1584, describes the dictionary
as its most adventurous project since it started the first edition
in the 19th century and completed it in 1928.
   It has put the vocabulary of English since 1150 A.D. on a
computer, creating a data base for the language that can be
continuously updated and eventually be made accessible to any
subscriber with a home computer.
   The cost was estimated at approximately $10 million when details
were first announced in May 1984.
   The 1,100-page first volume of the monumental work to be printed
and bound was sent to the seven-day Frankfurt Book Fair in West
Germany, which opened Tuesday.
   ``The first volume we got ready is actually volume two. Volume
one contains a 68-page introduction which wasn't ready in time,''
Craddock said.
   ``It's a 12-month production job just to print and bind the
first run of the dictionary,'' he said.
   The first edition of the OED had 44 million words of text and
the second has 59 million, composed from 350 million printed
characters.
   There are 290,500 main entries on different words, an increase
of 15 percent on the first edition.
   In addition, there are 157,000 combinations and derivatives and
169,000 phrases making a total of 616,500 ``word forms'' which are
defined. The 1928 edition had 414,825.
   The dictionary contains 2,412,400 quotations illustrating how
writers used the words and the first known use of each word.
   The OED was first published in parts between 1884 and 1928 and a
supplement of new words and words missed the first time around was
added in 1933. Together they made up 13 volumes.
   The last of four additional volumes, including the 1933
supplement and 69,000 modern words added to the lexicon, was
finished in 1986 by New Zealander Robert Burchfield, who took 29
years to finish it. The publishers had expected it to take seven
years.
   Since Burchfield's four volumes, 5,000 new words have been added
_ ``most of them at the beginning of the alphabet as Burchfield was
continually adding as he progressed,'' said Craddock.
   James Murray, a Scottish village tailor's son, was the
dictionary's original editor.
   Computerizing the new OED has taken five years under the
supervision of the dictionary's co-editors, John Simpson and Edmund
Weiner. The computer science department of the University of
Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, helped to devise the software and the
British arm of International Business Machines provided the
hardware.
   According to Craddock, the new OED is ``more than five times the
size of any other dictionary of the English language.''

   The Singer Co. said Tuesday it had
completed its $2 billion divestiture program with the sale of its
Kearfott Division to Astronautics Corp. of America.
   Singer was acquired by Bilzerian Partners in February for about
$1 billion.
   The new owners embarked on a divestiture plan that has seen the
company sell eight units since May.
   ``Our plan from the outset of the acquisition was to retain
Singer businesses with approximately $400 million of annual
revenues,'' said Paul A. Bilzerian, Singer chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company said the sales have brought in more money than the
acquisition cost, including debt, interest expense and other
expenses.
   The Kearfott Division, based in Little Falls, N.J., is involved
in making equipment used in guidance and navigation systems.
   Astronautics is based in Milwaukee and is involved in making
aircraft instruments and flight control systems.
   What's left at Singer is a company involved principally in
defense-related work with total sales expected to exceed $400
million in 1988. The company also has a 27 percent interest in SSMC
Inc., a joint venture in Japan with Mitsubishi.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Raises Offer for Supermarket Chain to $5.03 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. raised its takeover offer for Kroger Co. to $5.03 billion
Tuesday, surpassing a planned $4.6 billion defensive restructuring
announced by the grocery giant last month.
   Kohlberg Kravis said that based on its assessment of the
restructuring proposal, it was willing to pay $64 in cash and
securities for each of Kroger's 78.6 million shares outstanding. It
had offer $58.50 in cash and securities previously.
   The announcement revived prospects for another round of bidding
for Kroger, one of the nation's largest supermarket chains that has
long been identified as a takeover target.
   ``The Kroger Company's management, legal and financial advisers
are reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from KKR,'' said Paul
Bernish, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based Kroger.
   He said the company had no further comment.
   Kroger stock was among the most actively traded issues Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 87{ cents a share to
$55.37{ as more than 1.2 million shares changed hands.
   The chain has been resisting takeover maneuvers from Kohlberg
Kravis and the Haft family of Maryland, two longtime adversaries
who have battled for other supermarket businesses in the past.
   Kohlberg Kravis's sweetened offer was announced after business
hours, and there was no answer at the offices of Dart Group Inc.,
the Haft-run retailing concern in Landover, Md.
   As outlined in a brief press statement, the sweetened offer is
composed of $50 in cash, $11 in debt securities and $3 in stock of
the new company that Kohlberg Kravis would create from Kroger. The
investment firm's earlier offer contained the same cash portion of
$50 but only $8.50 in securities.
   Kroger announced an extensive restructuring plan on Sept. 13
designed to foil bids from Kohlberg Kravis and the Hafts, who had
offered $4.32 billion.
   That restructuring plan, which Kroger valued at $4.6 billion,
also would leave shareholders with a continuing interest in the
company but would reshape it into a smaller, leaner and more
heavily indebted business.
   Part of the plan included layoffs and the sale of operations,
including some food processing facilities as well as stores in
Alabama, California, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas
and Virginia.
   The takeover struggle for Kroger began earlier in the month when
the Hafts received clearance from federal antitrust regulators to
buy at least $15 million worth of Kroger stock.
   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also
processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside
customers.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Reorganization Plan For Placid Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved a
reorganization plan for Placid Oil Co., owned by the trust estates
of the Hunt brothers of Dallas.
   In approving the plan, Judge Harold Abramson paved the way for
the Hunts and their lenders to settle a two-year dispute over $1.5
billion in bank loans. The previously announced reorganization plan
had been proposed by William Herbert Hunt, Nelson Bunker Hunt,
Lamar Hunt and 17 of their creditor banks.
   It calls for $663 million in payments and a seven-year note for
$140 million, to be secured by profits from producing properties.
   The Hunts have paid $223.5 million and will raise another $200
million through the sale of their interest in Thanksgiving Tower, a
downtown Dallas office building, and through Placid's stake in the
Black Lake natural gas field in Louisiana.
   The Hunts' North Sea oil and gas operations will secure a
10-year loan with Dutch banks, to raise another $240 million.
   The judge approved the reorganization plan on Friday. A Hunt
spokesman said the transactions are expected to close in several
weeks and will complete the settlement and release Placid from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   In a separate reoganization plan approved last month, the other
half of the Hunts' $1.5 billion in bank debts was settled.
   That $750 million settlement for the three Hunt trusts, the
former sole owners of Penrod Drilling Co., discharged the trusts
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

   The executive director of the National
Center for Health Promotion issued a warning against smokeless
cigarettes Tuesday, saying the smoking alternative is as dangerous
as low-tar cigarettes.
   ``Anyone who suggests that smokeless cigarettes are a healthy
smoking option is perpetrating a cruel fraud on the American
public,'' Michael Samuelson said.
   Smokeless cigarettes recently were introduced by RJR Nabisco Inc.
   The Ann Arbor-based center said many smokers may try the
cigarettes as a way to quit smoking, but Samuelson said people who
use smokeless cigarettes continue their physical and psychological
addiction to nicotine.
   Samuelson also warned that non-smokers who inhale carbon
monoxide produced by smokeless cigarettes also endanger their
health.

<HEAD>Lawmakers: `Unwarranted' Food Price Hikes Found in Wake of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators have found price
increases for bread, pasta, beef and poultry have been greater than
should have resulted from the summer drought, two lawmakers
announced Tuesday.
   ``Consumers should be aware of this situation and should use
their clout through comparison shopping to fight unwarranted price
jumps,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, and Rep. Byron Dorgan, in a
joint statement.
   They released results of a study of drought-related price
increases made by the General Accounting Office, an investigative
arm of Congress.
   It showed that pasta prices have jumped more than 8 percent
since April. Retail increases of only 4 percent to 5 percent are
warranted by destruction of wheat, said Dorgan, a North Dakota
Democrat, and Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
   ``Comparing the prices of different brands _ and even prices in
different stores _ can help prevent anyone from taking unfair
advantage of consumers,'' the two lawmakers said.
   ``Food processors and retailers need to know that we are all
watching and they must be held accountable for any food price
increases not directly attributable to higher costs,'' they added.
   The General Accounting Office reported that the price of ground
beef has increased 3 percent while the price that livestock
producers get for cattle actually has dropped 11 percent since
April.
   Skyrocketing feed prices have accelerated the sale of cattle and
thus created a buyers' market.
   The GAO said fruit prices rose an average of 12 percent while
bread prices increased 4 percent.
   The two lawmakers said that the agency used the same data used
to make up the consumer price index produced by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. They stressed that the figures involved represent
national averages and that there could be differences from one
region to another.
   Two consumer organizations issued a report on Monday that
Consumer Federation of America monitors around the country found no
``price gouging'' in July and August but ``substantial'' increases
in beef and some other agricultural goods in June.
   The report was issued jointly by the consumer federation and
Washington-based Public Voice on Food, Health and Policy, whose
executive director, Ellen Haas, was to be among witnesses when the
Senate Agriculture Committee holds a hearing Wednesday on the GAO
findings.
   The Agriculture Department has been trying to calm concerns
about possible inordinate price increases in the wake of the
drought. It has estimated that the drought would add 1 percent to
food prices this year and perhaps 2 percent in 1989, bringing an
increase of no more than 6 percent in the consumer price index for
food next year.

<TEXT>
   Former General Electric Co. executive
Anthony L. Craig will succeed Joe M. Henson as president and chief
executive officer of Prime Computer Inc. after a transition of a
few months, Prime said Tuesday.
   The company also said its board of directors has approved a
stockholder rights plan aimed at thwarting any hostile takeover
attempt.
   Henson, 55, has been chief executive of the Natick-based
computer maker since November 1981. Company officials described his
departure as amicable, voluntary and expected, saying he had
informed the board privately last year of his intention to leave.
   Craig, 43, has been president of GE's Information Services
Division. He is stepping in immediately as Prime's chief operating
officer, executive vice president and a member of the board. After
a transition of a few months, he will assume Henson's posts,
according to Prime spokesman Richard Eckel.
   Henson said he had no personal plans except to take a long
vacation and possibly to pursue interests in government and
community service.
   Prime has been facing some problems and has not been immune to
the uncertainties affecting the industry as a whole.
   Prime's profits rose 38 percent to a record $64.8 million in
1987, but the company stumbled this year when aggressive pricing by
its competitors forced it to pull out of the mini-supercomputer
market and take a $5 million charge against earnings.
   In addition, Prime's $435 million takeover of Computervision
Corp. in February has brought pressure from Wall Street to reduce
operating costs. Henson announced in May that Prime would eliminate
700 jobs _ about 5 percent of its worldwide workforce of 13,000 _
through attrition and layoffs.
   Prime also has been caught in an awkward position in the
industry-wide battle between AT&T's UNIX software and a new
software standard under development by a coalition of rival
computer makers, including International Business Machines Inc. and
Digital Equipment Corp.
   Prime's products are built around the existing UNIX standard,
and Henson termed the industry battle unfortunate.
   ``I'm hopeful that the industry will resolve this debate before
long,'' he said. ``Today, clearly, our products support the only
available Unix standard, which is AT&T's system 5. But we have
expressed an interest in supporting a unified industry standard.
What we don't want to see happen is a fragmentation.''
   Craig did not signal any major changes in corporate direction.
He said he would continue to pursue Prime's current strategy, which
he defined as ``focusing on integrated solutions that deal not just
with hardware, but go beyond that to the applications...and deal
with the support, the design, the training of personnel ... to
bring more value to our customers.''
   Craig has been president of GE's information services business
since September 1986. He joined that division in 1983 as vice
president of international sales after 17 years as a product
manager and marketing executive for IBM.
   Taking over Computervision, which is based in Bedford, Mass.,
has made Prime second only to IBM in the market for computer-aided
design and manufacturing systems.
   Prime is projecting revenue this year of $1.6 billion, up from
$961 million last year, with much of the increase resulting from
the Computervision merger.
   Computervision reported earnings of $19.4 million on revenue of
$564 million in 1987. Prime reported earnings of $21.7 million on
revenue of $772.1 million for the first six months of this year.
   Prime said its new takeover defense would provide stockholders
rights to purchase additional shares in the event of a hostile
takeover. A dividend of one purchase right was declared for each
outstanding share of common stock, payable to stockholders of
record on Oct. 18.

<HEAD>Fruehauf In Buyout Talks With Varity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fruehauf Corp., a truck-trailer manufacturer, has
signed a letter of intent to discuss a possible stock-swap
acquisition by Varity Corp., a Toronto-based heavy machinery maker,
the companies said Tuesday.
   Under the proposed transaction, announced after the close of
stock trading, Fruehauf stockholders would receive two shares of
Varity stock for each share of Fruehauf, and Fruehauf would become
a Varity subsidiary.
   Varity spokesman J.R. Nowling said further details would not be
released. He said a letter of intent to pursue the merger will
expire Oct. 31 if no agreement is reached.
   Fruehauf's publicly-traded Class B stock closed at $5.87{ a
share, up 12{ cents Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Varity
dipped 12{ cents to $2.62{ a share.
   The merger would be subject to approval by the boards of both
companies and the Fruehauf shareholders, the companies said.
   Varity, formerly Massey-Ferguson, said Aug. 31 it was interested
in acquiring Fruehauf's Kelsey-Hayes subsidiary and might buy the
parent company and spin off its truck-trailer manufacturing
business.
   Kelsey-Hayes, acquired by Fruehauf in 1973, manufactures auto
and truck wheels and industrial parts and is a leading supplier of
anti-lock braking systems.
   Fruehauf was left with big debts, high interest payments and
operating losses in its trailer and maritime operations following a
leveraged buyout by executives in December 1986 to ward off a
hostile takeover bid by New York raider Asher Edelman.
   For the first six months of 1988, Fruehauf had a net loss of
$27.1 million on revenue of $1.03 billion, compared with a loss of
$21.1 million on revenue of $1 billion in the same period a year
earlier.
   In June, Fruehauf sold its agricultural wheel division for $8.8
million and some land for $6.5 million. Money from both sales was
received in June and applied to long-term debt.
   Varity posted a profit of $33.5 million, or 13 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.14 billion in the six months ended July 31. The
profit included a one-time $14.4 million tax credit. In the same
period of 1987 the company lost $17.6 million, due partly to an
$8.6 million writedown, on revenue of $915.3 million.
