   Bond was revoked Tuesday for a couple
facing sentencing for income tax evasion after an IRS agent
testified they stashed $1 million in valuables in hiding places
such as trucks and a chicken coop.
   Randall and Trula Walker of Springfield are accused of
plundering Campbell 66, once a nationwide trucking firm run by
Trula Walker's father.
   Walker, the company's former secretary-treasurer, pleaded guilty
Aug. 2 to concealing income by submitting false income tax returns
from 1981-85. He also pleaded guilty to filing false income reports
to the Interstate Commerce Commission for Campbell 66.
   Mrs. Walker was found guilty in August of tax evasion and
conspiring to defraud the federal government.
   The Walkers were jailed Friday after authorities discovered
caches of jewelry, furniture and cash at several sites in
Springfield.
   ``By the IRS recovering part of this treasure trove, the risk
that the Walkers might flee is enhanced, not lessened,'' U.S.
District Judge Dean Whipple said in ordering them held without
bond. ``It is obvious that they intended to keep these assets
hidden until they paid whatever fines might be assessed, and then
still have a mother lode to start over with.''
   Whipple said he hoped to sentence the couple this week.
   IRS agent James Pierce testified Tuesday that two confidential
sources led agents to the stashed assets, some of which had been
buried in a chicken coop and a machine shed. Agents also found
semi-truck loads of furniture, including a 5-foot-tall chandelier
and several pieces of antique furniture.
   Pierce said as many as four truckloads may have been filled with
the Walkers' assets in the past two years.
   Other assets uncovered included about $315,000 in cash, nearly
600 precious stones and 30 pounds of gold flatware.
   Pierce testified that agents were still trying to determine the
whereabouts of furs and ``almost priceless'' jeweled Faberge Easter
eggs.
   Once, about $150,000 of the buried money became wet and one of
the confidential sources dried it in a clothes dryer, Pierce said.
   ``The confidential source said that at one point, with both
Walkers present, he put jewelry in a pipe,'' Pierce said. ``The
jewelry was found in a machine shop near the source's home, buried
under a floor.''
   Pierce also said agents found jewelry and cash encased in cement
in a tool shed and about $150,000 to $160,000 in a chicken coop.
Another $180,000 was found buried in two glass jars.
   He said a preliminary assessment showed that the items found
were valued at a little over $1 million. The Walkers owe the IRS at
least that much, he said.
   Ken Kabonic, a probation officer in Springfield, testified that
the Walkers submitted 1988 financial statements to him in August
saying they had $6,250 cash on hand and total personal property of
about $5,000.

<HEAD>Activists Say U.S. Navy Turned Water Hoses On Anti-Nuke Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three anti-nuclear protesters were
arrested for trying to cling to the hull of a U.S. Navy frigate,
and activists charged Tuesday that crew members turned high-powered
water hoses on the demonstrators.
   The protesters, who were in rubber dinghies,, were charged with
disorderly conduct after the incident Monday.
   They tried to hang onto the hull of the USS Brewton, which was
moored near Albany off the southern coast of Western Australia.
   Cmdr. Kraig Kennedy, the Brewton's commander, said hoses were
turned on the protesters because they planned to deface the vessel
with spray paint. Earlier, the three attached a banner to the ship.
   Kennedy said the action may have been ``heavy-handed'' but that
every precaution was taken to prevent injury.
   Jo Vallentine, a member of Parliament and an activist in the
Party for Nuclear Disarmament, demanded an apology, saying one
protester was treated at a hospital for an eye injury and facial
bruises.
   `I believe it is the U.S. Navy that should be charged with
disorderly conduct,'' she told reporters after a meeting with
Kennedy.

   Teachers carried picket signs in more than 20 public school
districts in four states Tuesday. Many held out for raises, and the
biggest pay demand, 42 percent over three years, drew the ire of a
mayor as ``irresponsible.''
   ``The teachers decided it's time to take a stand and that stand
actually is a walk and that's what we'll be doing tomorrow morning:
walking a picket line,'' said Thomas Grady, head of the United
Teachers of Lowell, Mass., after a unanimous strike vote there
Tuesday. The first day of school was canceled Wednesday for the
city's 13,100 pupils.
   Nationally, walkouts affected more than 100,000 pupils in
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Illinois. A strike in its
third week in Louisiana was settled Tuesday night.
   More than 1,400 professors and academic staff members at Wayne
State University in Detroit also went on strike Tuesday over union
work rules and salary. University president David Adamany predicted
classes for the roughly 30,000 students would continue with other
full-time and part-time instructors, but professors said they
expected few classes to be held.
   An additional 950 clerical workers and secretaries represented
by the United Auto Workers have been on strike at Wayne State since
Aug. 25.
   In Pontiac, Mich., bargainers representing 991 teachers met with
school officials through the weekend with no success. Major issues
were class size and salary, with teachers asking for a 10 percent
raise and being offered 2 percent, Michigan Education Association
spokeswoman Colleen Hudgens said.
   Superintendent LaBarbara Gragg said Monday night that talks
would be scheduled later in the week. Meanwhile, classes that
opened Sept. 1 were canceled Tuesday for Pontiac's 17,284 students
as teachers picketed, Deputy Superintendent Byron Love said.
   In State College, Pa., 415 teachers staged the first strike in
the district's history, said union spokesman George Apaliski. About
5,900 students missed the scheduled opening day of school Tuesday.
   ``We are not at all close,'' district spokeswoman Patricia Best
said. ``It's very discouraging.'' The school board offered a 33
percent raise over three years, Ms. Best said. The State College
Area Education Association has not made public its pay demand.
   In Massachusetts, teachers in nearly 40 school districts are
going to work this week without a contract. The only strike votes
taken, however, were in Lowell and Peabody. Teacher strikes are
illegal in Massachusetts.
   Officials canceled the first day of school for 13,100 pupils
Wednesday in Lowell, Mass., after the district's 970 teachers voted
unanimously to strike for more pay and to preserve longevity
bonuses.
   In Peabody, the city's 408 teachers rejected a 17 percent wage
increase over three years and held out for 42 percent over the same
time span.
   ``To sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally
irresponsible,'' said Peabody Mayor Peter Torigian.
   School Superintendent James Buckley said administrators were
trying to bring in enough substitutes to keep classes going.
   Bert Latessa of the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers
defended the union's position. The 42 percent wage request, Latessa
said, is smaller than it appears because the teachers maintain that
they have been performing extra duties such as elementary
preparation and handling oversized classes without extra pay.
   Here was the picture by state-by-state:
   Michigan: Strikes in 10 districts idled nearly 45,000 students
and more than 2,000 teachers, the Michigan Education Association
said.
   Pennsylvania: Strikes by about 2,200 teachers in nine districts
affected about 36,000 students, according to George Badner of the
Pennsylvania Education Association.
   Massachusetts: Strike votes by union representing 1,378 teachers
affected two districts.
   Illinois: Strikes in two districts affected 501 teachers and
9,145 pupils in Granite City, Farmer City, Mansfield and Bellflower.
   Louisiana: About 600 teachers, joined by bus drivers, ended a
strike Tuesday night after school officials agreed to collective
bargaining in Vermilion Parish, where a 6 percent pay cut was
imposed in 1987.

<HEAD>Shooting Of 11-Year-Old Galvanizes Boston Neighborhood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of an 11-year-old girl caught in a cross
fire between rival drug-dealing street gangs has galvanized a
Boston community ``like nothing else in years,'' one city official
says.
   Tiffany Moore, who had been sent away by her mother to live with
relatives in the South because of the violence in her Roxbury
neighborhood, was home for a visit when she was shot twice in the
head Aug. 19 while sitting on a corner mailbox talking with friends.
   More than 400 people attended the funeral. In the weeks since
the shooting, neighborhood leaders have met with the mayor and
police commissioner to demand a war on crime. Some even suggested
that the National Guard be called up.
   At meetings in the adjacent Roxbury and Dorchester sections,
people have developed proposals that include circulating the names
and pictures of known drug dealers. Some activists have gathered
hundreds of signatures on petitions calling for evening court
sessions to handle drug-related cases.
   Bruce Bolling, Roxbury's representative in the Boston City
Council, said the shooting had ``galvanized this community ... like
nothing else in years.''
   In 29 years of law enforcement, said Deputy Police
Superintendent William R. Celester, ``I have never seen the
cooperation I have seen in the past three weeks ... People are
telling me to take the gloves off and take back the streets.''
   Bolling suggested why the death of the girl had touched people
so deeply.
   ``A little girl, totally innocent _ people can relate to that,
because they think of their own families, and suddenly they
recognize how vulnerable they are and how pervasive this problem
has become,'' he said.
   Violence in Roxbury had captured the community's attention by
the time of Tiffany's killing. In July, two undercover state police
troopers were wounded when they attempted to make a drug ``buy.''
Within hours of the two shootings, a Boston police office also was
wounded, and police wounded a suspect in an unrelated shooting.
   A week after Tiffany's death, Richard Bailey, 14, was fatally
stabbed in front of his sister and other children. Police said the
stabbing stemmed from an earlier fight and may have been connected
to young gang activity.
   The pressure on police was intense to make quick arrests in the
two killings. At one point, Boston police Commissioner Francis
Roache publicly rejected the calls by activists to call in the
National Guard. Roache said the city's 1,900-member police force
could handle the situation.
   Thirty detectives were assigned full-time to hunt for Tiffany's
killers; within two weeks, they had arrested two suspects. Four
suspects were arrested in the 14-year-old boy's stabbing.
   Police also have assigned two police officers to walk the street
in the Roxbury neighborhood where Tiffany was killed.
   Two years ago, the violence in Roxbury had so alarmed Tiffany's
mother that she sent Tiffany and an older sister to live with
relatives in Greenville, S.C.
   Tiffany was in Boston for a two-week visit with her mother; on
Aug. 21, two days after the shooting, she was supposed to return to
South Carolina.
   Alice Moore, her mother, was upstairs in her apartment that hot
night, lying on her bed and talking with a friend, when ``A little
girl ran up and said Tiffany get shot and I ran down.
   ``I didn't take time to put on my shoes or lock my door or
nothing, but when I got there, she was already dead. I was rubbing
her skin and it was tightening up. I called her name and I called
her name and she didn't say nothing.''
   Mrs. Moore, sitting in her living room under a tapestry of Jesus
and a portrait of Marthur Luther King Jr., said people cared about
her daughter's death not just because she was so innocent but
because she was special.
   Tiffany's ambition, she said, was to become a doctor or teacher.
She played the organ and trombone. She like to talk with her
friends as they took turns braiding each other's hair.
   Mrs. Moore said she's talked with all the politicians, reporters
and television crews who visit her apartment because ``It makes me
feel like people care.''
   Holding a diary Tiffany kept and looking at family snapshots,
Mrs. Moore said: ``I was trying for them to be somebody, not just
hanging on the street.''

   Burglars recently broke into the home
of an elderly couple, ransacked the house and stabbed the wife. A
few weeks later, a city councilman was found dead after exposing
members of a car theft ring.
   On the surface, such incidents appear regrettably routine in a
city with one of the world's highest crime rates. But in both cases
officials admit the crimes were carried out by police.
   Hardly a day passes without newspapers reporting crimes of
violence in Manila and elsewhere that were carried out by the very
people charged with protecting society.
   During the first seven months of 1988, 67 policemen were fired
for involvement in crimes nationwide. Most were assigned in the
Manila area. Of the 67 policemen, 18 were charged with murder,
according to official figures.
   Cicero Campos, chairman of the National Police Commission, said
his agency receives an average of 1,500 complaints each year of
criminal activity among the country's 52,000 policemen.
   But he admits the figure represents ``the tip of the iceberg''
because the majority of crimes committed by police and soldiers are
never reported.
   Much of the crime involves petty ``shakedowns.'' For example,
traffic policemen extorting motorists for unauthorized, on-the-spot
``fines'' are a common sight on Manila's busy thoroughfares.
   Last month, Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, told a congressional committee that investigators
recently cracked a massive car-theft ring made up mostly of
soldiers and police.
   Montano said the arrests of the corrupt officers contributed to
a significant reduction in the number of car thefts in the country.
   Poorly paid policemen often moonlight as bouncers for bars and
prostitution fronts. Others join crime syndicates involved in
gambling, narcotics and prostitution, either by guaranteeing them
virtual immunity from arrest or, in some cases, serving as
bodyguards for mob leaders.
   Policemen are widely assumed to have been involved in the
unsolved slaying of leftist leaders.
   Five policemen have been charged with the attempted murder in
June of leftist Nemesio Prudente, president of the Polytechnic
University of the Philippines. The officers, who were on duty when
they allegedly attacked Prudente, are scheduled for arraignment
this month.
   Crimes committed by police rose to unprecedented levels during
the 20-year rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted on
Feb. 25, 1986, after a civilian-military uprising that propelled
Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   Many soldiers and police joined the uprising against Marcos.
Once in office, Mrs. Aquino pledged to restore honest government
and end abuses by police and soldiers. But the police department's
image, as well as the government's own prestige, is now threatened
by a resurgence of corruption.
   Julie Yap Daza, a prominent newspaper and broadcast commentator,
wrote in the Manila Standard that corruption has reached
unacceptable levels.
   ``Police corruption is not unique to us, all right,'' she wrote.
``But this is corruption with a different face, the face of
perversion.... It is a dark time for the good cops, if there are
any left.''
   Campos, a retired Constabulary brigadier general, blames the
problem on low salaries. A patrolman receives a monthly starting
salary of $50, well below the government's poverty line of $120 a
month for a family of five.
   ``We do not have a coterie of angels or saints in the police
force,'' he said in an interview. ``But certainly these people are
all humans, and they are up for temptation. Perhaps what we can do
is insulate them from temptation.''
   He said the commission has recommended that Congress increase
police salaries as a step toward curbing corruption.

<HEAD>Warmup for Hecht-Bryan Battle in Nevada; Florida Voters Narrow
Senate Field</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nevada voters were expected to set the stage today for
Democratic Gov. Dick Bryan's drive to oust Republican Sen. Chic
Hecht, while six Florida Democrats and two Republicans fought over
the seat of retiring Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   Hecht and Bryan faced only token opposition in today's
primaries, and for months they have been attacking each other.
Hecht, who is seeking his second term, has criticized the governor
as too pro-labor. Bryan, in the middle of his second term, has
charged Hecht with lacking credibility and being ineffective.
   A poll taken in August for the gaming industry showed Bryan with
a 14-point lead over Hecht, who six years ago narrowly defeated
Democratic Sen. Howard Cannon after the incumbent was implicated in
a Teamsters union scandal. Hecht has stopped releasing his own poll
results but said he is closing the gap and considers the race a
toss-up.
   Hecht, whose voting record is extremely conservative, has become
known for his occasional verbal miscues, once referring to a
``nuclear suppository'' when he meant ``repository.'' A recent
survey of Senate administrative assistants ranked him as the least
effective senator in Washington.
   Hecht's only primary opponent is Larry Scheffler, 38-year-old
owner of a graphics business in Henderson who said he would press
for reprocessing nuclear waste brought to Nevada so that only
low-level, less radioactive waste would remain.
   Bryan's opponents in the Democratic primary are Manford ``Cave
Rock Manny'' Beals, Patrick Fitzpatrick, and Larry Kepler.
   In Florida, a two-man Republican primary matched Rep. Connie
Mack III, grandson of the legendary Philadelphia A's baseball
manager, against former U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who
successfully prosecuted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder
Rivas.
   Merkle entered the race late, in June, and Mack was heavily
favored in pre-election polls after outspending his rival by about
$2.2 million to $100,000.
   President Reagan and former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North made
appearances for Mack, who has one of the most conservative records
in Congress.
   Merkle was frustrated by Mack's refusal to debate, and
emphasized that point by carrying around a life-size replica of
Mack he called ``Cardboard Connie.''
   ``If he debates me, he knows the jig's up,'' said Merkle. ``He'd
be forced to discuss issues. ... People would see the lights are on
but nobody's home.''
   Mack said Merkle wasn't ``a viable candidate,'' and that there
was no reason ``to have been drawn into his campaign. My feeling
was that we should continue with delivery of the message we started
with in October, talking about the importance of freedom, free
markets, less taxes, freedom as an objective of foreign policy.''
   For the Democrats, state Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter
appeared to hold a wide lead, but not wide enough to win a majority
and avoid an Oct. 4 runoff with the second-place finisher.
   Others in the race were Reps. Dan Mica and Kenneth ``Buddy''
McKay, state Sen. Patricia Frank, former Republican Gov. Claude
Kirk and former Senate postal clerk Fred Rader.
   Gunter, who lost to Paula Hawkins in the 1980 Senate race,
raised $1 million within six weeks of announcing, and opponents
noted he took at least $160,000 from the insurance industry he
regulates. MacKay campaign manager Greg Farmer called Gunter's
department ``a saga of sleaze.''
   The early Democratic frontrunner, former Gov. Reubin Askew, quit
the race in May, saying running for office had become too expensive.
   Democrats acknowledge that their crowded field and likely runoff
may hurt their prospects in November.
   ``I don't think it'll be an easy race, but I think it's
winnable,'' said State Democratic Chairman Charles Whitehead.

   Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be
restless, says Willie Nelson, who blames his wanderlust nature for
ruining three marriages.
   The country music singer says in his autobiography, ``Willie,''
due out next month from Simon and Schuster, that he prefers the
road to matrimony.
   Nelson met his third wife, Connie, in 1969. They married, had
two children and lived in Westlake Hills on the shores of Lake
Austin, Texas.
   But they spent much of their time arguing.
   ``For me the choice came down to staying ... with Connie all the
time when I came off the road _ which meant giving up all my pals
who I hung around with on the golf course or in my recording studio
_ or never going back to the ... house again,'' Nelson said in his
book.
   He chose to leave and the couple divorced.
   Nelson, whose hits include ``Mama, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up
to Be Cowboys,'' and ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,'' admits life
as Mrs. Willie Nelson would be difficult.
   ``It's not easy to be married to somebody like me and be a wife
and stay home and take care of the family when I'm out here acting
like a big star,'' Nelson said. ``I mean, it rubs.''

   ``But don't get me wrong. This is a great job that I've got. I
enjoy it and I know there's a part of me that needs that

   Manilow concedes that his own time in the spotlight has been
sporadic, by choice.
   ``I've done it this way throughout my career,'' the Tony, Emmy

   Manilow, known for the hits ``Mandy'' and ``I Made It Through

   Time has run out on a congressional bid to
grant tennis star Ivan Lendl immediate citizenship so he could play
on the U.S. Olympic team, lawmakers said.
   Lendl has lived in Greenwich, Conn., since 1981 and wanted to
represent his adopted homeland in Seoul this month.
   Enlisting the help of Connecticut lawmakers, Lendl won House
Judiciary Committee approval in April of a special immigration bill.
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., blocked the measure on
the House floor, saying he would drop his opposition only if the
Czech government provided a waiver for Lendl to be a member of the
U.S. team.
   Olympic rules required a waiver because Lendl had represented
Czechoslovakia in international competition at the Davis Cup.
   The Czechoslovak Association of Physical Culture rejected the
waiver.
   ``We pressed the issue,'' Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., said
last week. ``Maybe we could have (succeeded) with more time, but
... time has basically run out.''
   Lendl, 28, received his permanent residence status last year. He
will be eligible for citizenship through traditional procedures in
1992. His attorney and spokeswoman did not return telephone calls
for comment.

   Philbin left Los Angeles and his KABC-TV ``A.M. Los Angeles''
morning magazine show in 1981 for a similar job in New York City,
only to return for the Labor Day debut of a new celebrity talk show

   The Prince and Princess of Wales canceled an
appearance at the premiere of a film about a daring British train
robber because its star, singer Phil Collins, advised them not to
go.
   Collins, who plays train robber Ronald ``Buster'' Edwards in the
film ``Buster,'' said Monday he wrote Prince Charles and Princess
Diana that they should shun the Sept. 15 premiere.
   ```Buster' does not in any way glorify crime'' as critics have
claimed, Collins said.
   But, he said, in light of the controversy, he wrote the royal
couple ``suggesting that it would probably be best if they did not
attend.''
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the prince and princess were
``aware of the contents of the letter that Phil Collins has written
them and in the light of this they have decided not to go.''
   The Great Train Robbery of Aug. 8, 1963, was one of Britain's
most daring heists. More than 120 mailbags containing $7 million in
used banknotes were taken off a mail train from Glasgow to London
of which less than $980,000 were recovered.
   Thirteen people, including Edwards, stood trial in 1964 for the
crime. No one was killed during the robbery, but one man was
seriously injured.

   Miss Arkansas, a blue-eyed blonde
singer, has the best chances of winning the 1989 Miss America
title, says a retired statistics professor.
   Patti Thorn, 23, has a 7-1 chance over the 50 other contestants
vying for the crown Saturday, said George L. Miller, of Bellevue,
Wash.
   For the past 10 years _ to the displeasure of pageant officials
_ Miller has entered facts and figures about the contestants into
his home computer and calculated their odds based on past winners
and finalists.
   Miller's statistics gained credibility in 1980 when he correctly
predicted Cheryl Prewitt would take the title.
   But he has not been successful every year. Most recently, Miller
picked Kellye Cash as Miss America 1987, but did not even have last
year's winner, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, in his top 10.
   ``She was a dancer who was a nurse and those are both zero
categories on my list,'' he said Monday.
   To make his predictions, Miller, who retired from Northern
Illinois University in 1984, uses such factors as height, weight,
hair and eye color, academic major and talent. His computer
analysis further breaks down talent.
   ``If one is doing an acrobatic dance, that would be better than
an interpretive dance,'' he said.

   A day at the office for George Keeney is
spent carefully watching over his ``pets'' _ a barrel of
cockroaches, containers of cenipedes and jars of maggots.
   Keeney, 29, is an entomologist responsible for making sure
science classes at Ohio State University don't run short of things
that crawl and creep.
   ``We're kicking into high gear now that the students are coming
back,'' he said. ``One professor wanted 1,000 female German
cockroaches for one class last year. That's tedious work.''
   Most of Keeney's bugs are destined for dissection. Some will be
sprayed with chemicals in toxicology tests. Others will simply be
watched so students can study their behavior.
   Flies and cockroaches are high on the science professors'
most-wanted list. Keeney raises cockroaches by the barrelful.
   A few, like an unusual Central American ant that inflicts a
powerful sting, are being studied for possible use in fighting
illnesses.
   Keeney has two African millipedes. They look like foot-long hot
dogs standing on a thousand toothpick legs. Actually, they do not
have a thousand legs. Keeney counted them. They have 370.
   Centipedes have 54 legs.
   ``We're not doing any research with them right now,'' Keeney
said, picking up a handful of the insects. ``They're more or less
pets.''

<HEAD>Soviet Olympic Medalists Will Collect Cash in Seoul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets athletes who win gold medals at the Seoul
Olympics will be awarded the equivalent of $19,000 for their
efforts, the head of the Soviet Olympic Committee says.
   Marat Gramov announced the new policy at a news conference
Monday and denied such payments conflict with the purely amateur
status Soviet athletes purportedly possess.
   He said those on the 550-member Soviet team in Seoul who win
gold medals will be paid 12,000 rubles ($19,047). Silver medalists
will receive 5,000 rubles, and bronze medalists will collect 3,000
rubles.
   Those are handsome sums in a country where the average monthly
wage for a factory worker is around 200 rubles.
   According to Mikhail Dmitrieyev, deputy foreign editor of the
daily newspaper Sovietsky Sport, the sums earmarked for Seoul
medalists will be the largest ever paid to Soviet victors in a
Summer Games.
   ``If they received $100 in the past, it was considered a large
sum,'' Dmitrieyev said in a telephone interview, referring to
payments made to Soviet participants in the 1976 Montreal and 1980
Moscow games.
   The Soviet Union did not take part in the 1984 Olympics, held in
Los Angeles. According to Dmitrieyev, Soviet winners at the 1988
Calgary Winter Olympics also received large sums to reward them for
good performance.
   Gramov noted that 15 percent of the prize money paid to Soviet
medalists will be in foreign currency.
   That is important because the Soviet ruble, which is not
convertible into foreign currency, is useless abroad and cannot buy
the sort of Western consumer goods that many Soviets covet.

<HEAD>Christian Leaders And Universal Cash In On `Last Temptation'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' has proven to
be a blessing for conservative Christians.
   Denounced by its critics as blasphemous and profane, the movie
about a Jesus with human frailties not only has energized the
Christian right; it has revived stagnant fund-raising, Christian
leaders say.
   The movie ``has helped our ministry more than anything else
before,'' said the Rev. Donald Wildmon, leader of the American
Family Association. Said Don Beehler, director of communications
for Campus Crusade for Christ: ``This gives us a wonderful
opportunity to talk about the real Jesus Christ. ... We're taking
lemons and making lemonade.''
   At the same time, filmgoers are not avoiding the movie, as
Christian leaders had hoped. In fact, the controversy seems to have
prompted more people to see it.
   That price, though, might be a small one for Christian
activists. Beset by negative publicity from the Jim Bakker and
Jimmy Swaggart scandals, conservative Christians have used ``Last
Temptation'' as a lightning rod around which to organize and raise
money.
   In addition to bringing together fundamentalists, Pentecostals,
Prostestants and Catholics, the controversy makes for a natural
fund-raiser: It pits the conservative Christian organizations,
which often depict themselves as small and struggling, against a
Hollywood Goliath.
   The Concerned Women for America, in a fund-raising letter, said,
``Your gift of $100, $75, $50, $20 _ or whatever amount _ is sorely
needed. We need your financial help to fight these rich Hollywood
moguls.'' Similarly, the American Family Association has said that
those ``giving $15 or more to help AFA oppose the movie will
receive a one year subscription to the AFA Journal.''
   ``Jerry Falwell has been preaching about the movie for the last
three weeks,'' said the Rev. Robert Hymers, a Los Angeles minister
who has been one of the movie's most outspoken critics. ``Falwell's
doing a tremendous fund-rasing job through the film.''
   The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and
Property used a four-page, full-color attack on the movie to
solicit small contributions. ``People have put their money where
their values are,'' said Raymond Drake, president of the
organization. Drake said that a phone campaign brought in $39,000,
enough for a full-page advertisement in The New York Times against
the movie.
   It also may be true that some Christian-themed organizations are
trying to exploit the controversy for less-than-noble purposes.
   ``I've seen the fund-raising letters. (The movie) has become
another hype button to raise funds,'' said Cal Thomas, a syndicated
columnist and former comunications director for the Moral Majority.
   Universal Pictures, meanwhile, appears to have benefited from
the controversy. By telling people not to see the movie, Christian
leaders may have encouraged the opposite response. ``Universal is
raking in the dough,'' Thomas said.
   Studio officials refused comment.
   Although ``Last Temptation'' is by no means a blockbuster, it
has done respectable business for an art film, grossing more than
$2 million since its limited release Aug. 12. ``It wouldn't have
done anywhere near what's it's done without the controversy,'' said
Alex Ben Block, editor of the industry newsletter Sow Biz News.
``Although some Christians might have stayed away, many other
(filmgoers) went because of the controversy. People say, `If they
tell me I can't go, I'll go.' ''
   At the same time, production plans for at least one movie with a
Christian theme are not being stalled by the flap: ``Christ the
Man,'' to be directed by Paul Verhoeven, is in the planning stages
at Mel Brooks' production company. Described by company spokeswoman
Randy Auerbach as a serious interpretation of Jesus' life, the
movie will be ``absolutely unaffected'' by criticisms of ``Last
Temptation.''
   It is too early to tell if the attacks on Universal Pictures
will lead to any long-term losses, though Christian leaders are
hopeful. ``What we're sensing is a lot of people _ in the tens of
millions _ who are now angry at Universal,'' said Tim Penland, who
served as a consultant to film producer Universal Pictures before
becoming a leading critic of the movie.
   Wildmon and other activists will soon launch a boycott against
Universal's videocassette of ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' due
out Oct. 27.
   After that, there are no announced plans aimed at Universal.
But, said Beehler, ``Universal will always be remembered as the
studio that made a film defaming Jesus Christ.''

   Fire trucks from as far away as Nevada
took position in two smoke-filled Montana towns Monday and
residents here waited to see if a backfire would burn fast enough
to protect them from a wind-driven forest fire.
   ``First it starts snowing ash. Then it starts raining fire,''
said fire information officer Pat Kaunert as he stood in a
65-foot-wide fire break bulldozed through the forest.
   Top federal officials said that blaze and 12 other fires in and
around Yellowstone National Park had burned 900,000 acres as of
Monday.
   Gary Cargill, chief federal forester for the Rocky Mountains,
warned that an additional 300,000 acres may be consumed this week,
despite the efforts of 9,000 firefighters.
   And Cargill warned that 20 to 30 mph southwesterly wind is
expected to arrive in the region Tuesday with a weather front.
   Protection of life and property are the top priorities, he said
at a news conference in Bozeman. ``Containment of further acreage
is just not in the cards.''
   He said many of the nation's best firefighters ``are being
whipped day after day'' by the Yellowstone fires.
   Evacuation orders for Cooke City and a town three miles west,
Silver Gate, were issued Sunday morning. By Monday night, about 30
of the approximately 150 residents in the two towns remained, said
Bob Fry, an emergency services official.
   ``Some of them are staying around because they want to see what
the fire does,'' Fry said. ``They're mostly packed up, though, and
we're trying to push them out.''
   A backfire had been set by firefighters as a shield against the
approaching Storm Creek fire Sunday just a half-mile from Silver
Gate.
   Firefighters wanted to establish a two-mile buffer of charred
forest between Silver Gate and the 61,300-acre Storm Creek fire.
But by Monday, the backfire had burned only a half-mile swath, said
fire information officer Chris Comstock.
   ``With an 18 to 20 mph wind behind the fire, that line wouldn't
stop it. You'd just stand there in the line and watch it go over
your head,'' he said.
   And if the backfire hadn't gone far enough, the wind would blow
embers from the backfire itself into residential areas, endangering
the town it was meant to protect.
   To prepare for that possibility, fire trucks rolled into
positions around the two towns. About 75 trucks were called in from
as far as Nevada to protect buildings, Comstock said.
   ``We're here till they tell us to get out of Dodge,'' said Ty
Ripley, manning a fire truck from the eastern Montana town of
Glendive, 400 miles away.
   Comstock said firefighters also were worried that the Storm
Creek fire and three other major fires in and around Yellowstone
have created their own wind circulation, ``almost like a whirlpool
of wind,'' around the Yellowstone Basin.
   That circular wind pattern may encourage the fires to reach out
toward each other, which could create a huge ring of flame that
would eat its way inward through unburned forests, Comstock said.
   Also inside Yellowstone, firefighters worried that the expected
wind would blow the 141,900-acre North Fork fire back toward the
complex of visitor facilities around Old Faithful Geyser.
   But Steve Iobst, a fire information officer, said a lack of
vegetation in the Old Faithful area would make it easy to protect
the development.
   On the western side of the park, which is largely in Wyoming,
fire officials were confident they could protect West Yellowstone,
Mont., a community of 750 people, from an advancing lobe of the
North Fork fire just 2{ miles away Monday.
   ``Everything is based on what these winds do to us in a couple
of days,'' said Brian Avery, a senior Forest Service fire oficial,
referring to the anticipated southwesterly wind.
   About 30 miles to the west in the Targhee National Forest, about
55 firefighters battled a new 25-acre blaze believed caused by
humans. The fire burned to within 50 yards of half dozen summer
homes near Macks Inn, Idaho, but the winds pushed the flames in the
opposite direction, fire commander Wayne Bushnell said.
   In the northern Rockies, officials warned that an approaching
weather front could drive existing blazes past fire lines and cause
fires already brought under control to flare up again.
   The weather predictions prompted Forest Service officials to
begin work on an evacuation plan for permanent and summer
residences south of Fortine, in northwestern Montana. The Dry Fork
fire there has scorched 12,300 acres.
   ``Right now, we've got our fingers crossed that this wind isn't
going to be that harsh,'' said fire information officer Dick Guth.
That fire is considered about 60 percent contained.
   Elsewhere, calmer wind and slightly lower temperatures Monday
helped firefighters grapple with blazes that charred nearly 21,000
acres of southern California brush.
   Oregon's largest fire of the season was nearly contained at just
under 57,000 acres in the rugged Hell's Canyon National Recreation
Area.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner activated the National Guard to
help provide support and transportation for hundreds of
firefighters.
   Containment of Washington's largest fire, the 12,500-acre White
Mountain Complex in Ferry County, was at least five days away,
officials said Monday, but it had stopped moving toward the town of
Republic.
   In Utah, air tankers and fire crews scrambled Monday to stop a
runaway brush fire moving toward the northern Utah community of
Paradise, authorities said.
   ``Right now they've got a problem,'' said Kathy Jo Pollock,
Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman. ``They've got a 250-acre fire
heading for the town. It just broke out a little while ago.''
   The fire was the latest in a series of fires raging on Utah's
tinder-dry landscape Monday. Air tankers that had been used for a
5,400-acre brush fire near Salt Lake City were diverted to the fire
near Paradise, a community of about 500 residents between Ogden and
Logan in the Wasatch National Forest.
   Forests also burned in Idaho.

<HEAD>Report: US Schools Lack Adequate Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American schools have only one computer for
every 30 students and even those pupils with access to computers
get to use them an average of just one hour a week, a report to
Congress said today.
   The report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment
said ``today's classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50
years ago more closely than operating rooms or business offices
resemble their 1938 versions.''
   The agency estimated that schools have spent $2 billion on
computer hardware over the past decade. There are now 1.2 million
to 1.7 million computers in public schools, and fewer than 5
percent have no computers.
   But the agency said it would cost $4 billion to buy enough
equipment to reduce the student-computer ratio from 30-1 to 3-1.
   The 246-page report, based on two years' research, said that
between 1981 and 1987 the percentage of schools equipped with
computers for instructional use grew from 18 percent to 95 percent.
   But ``the vast majority of schools still do not have enough of
them to make the computer a central element of instruction,'' it
said.
   Computers are not the only new machines in American classrooms.
   ``The 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use of
advanced technology of all types,'' the report said.
   ``In 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders. Today
roughly 90 percent do,'' it said, adding that the availability of
cable and satellite transmission has made the television a more
potent teaching tool _ especially for schools in remote areas.
   ``In practice there is wide disparity _ one computer in a
classroom, clusters of computers in the library or classrooms, full
computer laboratories and classrooms with no computers,'' it said.
``Not all students use computers and ... those who do spend on
average a little more than one hour per week on the computer.''
   The report said that ``although new interactive technologies
cannot alone solve the problems of American education, they have
already contributed to important improvements in learning. These
tools can plan an even greater role ... both by helping children
acquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticated
skills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over their
lifetimes.''
   To tap the potential of technology, the report said, ``a greater
investment will be necessary,'' including a more active federal
role in spurring research and helping spread the new teaching tools.
   The report warned that ``the vast majority of those now teaching
or planning to teach have had little or no computer education or
training.'' Most of what they have been taught is to how to use
computers themselves, not how to teach with computers.
   ``Despite a nationwide call to improve teaching, there is almost
no federal money for the training of new teachers,'' it said.
   It said there are more than 10,000 educational software products
on the market, but the quality ``could be much better.''
   The Office of Technology Assessment is a nonpartisan analytical
agency for Congress.
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Committee on Education and Labor, which commissioned the study,
said increasing federal support for high-tech school aids ``would
be good public policy and a wise investment for the future.''
   The report cited several examples of schools putting computers
and other gear to good use, including:
   _Poteet High School in Mesquite, Texas, where interactive
videodiscs are used throughout the physical science curriculum,
allowing ninth graders to bring a volcanic eruption or solar flare
to life at the touch of a computer keyboard.
   _Sacred Heart Model School in Louisville, Ky., where fifth
graders recently assembled a computer database of their pets
(including 25 dogs, 4 hermit crabs and 1 guinea pig) and are
currently testing the acidity of the city's tap water for a
comparison with data from 199 other schools around the world.

<HEAD>Hay Prices Highest Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought-toasted 1988 hay crop is expected
to be the smallest in 12 years and prices are likely to be the
highest since the Agriculture Department began keeping annual
figures in 1909.
   Preliminary figures show that hay prices at the farm in August
averaged $83.10 per ton. Although that was unchanged from July, it
was an increase of 35 percent from $61.60 per ton in August 1987.
   No dramatic declines in hay prices are in sight, say department
economists. The supply is tight and demand is strong, meaning that
prices probably will remain high until spring.
   According to USDA records, the record for hay prices over an
entire season was $75.80 per ton set in 1983, another drought year.
That was an increase of less than 10 percent from the 1982 average
of $69.30 per ton.
   Historically, however, there have been larger year-to-year
percentage jumps in hay prices. In 1934, for example, hay rose 52
percent to $11.70 per ton from $7.70 in 1933. But a year later, in
1935, prices plummeted just as fast to $7.60 per ton.
   The latest USDA production estimate on Aug. 11 put this year's
hay harvest at 130.5 million tons on 66.2 million acres, down 12.5
percent from 1987 production of 149.1 million tons on 60.7 million
acres.
   It also is the smallest since the 1976 crop of 120.1 million
tons, says the department's Economic Research Service in a new
outlook report on the feed situation.
   ``Acreage harvested as reported in the August crop production
report is almost 2.8 million acres more than the area indicated for
harvest in the July report,'' the agency said. ``This increase
likely reflects in part the emergency haying rules (for
conservation land) under USDA's drought assistance measures.''
   At the beginning of the hay marketing year on May 1, the U.S.
inventory was estimated at 27.3 million tons. Counting this year's
production, that makes a total hay supply of 157.8 million tons for
1988-89, down 13 percent from last season.
   Meanwhile, the number of cattle and other ``roughage consuming
animal units'' will be about the same as last year, meaning there
will be less to go around.
   If each animal eats as much hay as it did last year, the U.S.
hay stockpile will be chewed down to only 3.8 million tons by May
1, 1989, a record low. Thus, the report said, it seems more
reasonable that producers will reduce hay portions to ration
available supplies.
   ``Hay use will depend on a number of additional factors,'' the
report said. ``Silage yields will be sharply reduced by the
drought. However, the area of silage harvested likely will be
increased, because of abandonment of areas intended for harvest as
grain.''
   The report added: ``More straw likely will be baled this year to
stretch out forage supplies. Fall pasture growth, or lack thereof,
and spring pasture conditions also will be important to hay use.
Good fall rains and pasture, and good early spring pasture would do
a lot to ease the pressure on hay supplies.''
   On the other hand, ``converse conditions would intensify supply
pressures'' and push up hay prices even further, it said.

   Farm-raised catfish production continues to
rise above year-earlier levels, according to Agriculture Department
reports.
   In July, production was an estimated 23.7 million pounds of live
weight delivered to processors, the department reports. The July
average price paid to growers was 80 cents per pound, up 19 cents
from the same month in 1987.
   So far this year, production was about 169.7 million pounds, up
from 160.4 million pounds through July 1987.
   In a related report, USDA said catfish farmers in 18 states had
sales worth $247 million last year. It was the first such survey
since 1981, when sales were $72 million, officials said.
   Of the 1987 sales total, hatchery operations accounted for $20.1
million, while sales from production were reported at $226.8
million.
   Last year's catfish sales, all sizes, were led by Mississippi at
$178.5 million, compared with $44.7 million in 1981.

up 4 percent from 1986-87, according to the Agriculture Department.
   An annual report by the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board also showed that the value of crop, at $566 million, was up 7
percent. Growers received an average of 89 cents per pound, up 2.5
cents from 1986-87.
   Pennsylvania, the traditional leader, reported a production
value of $205.1 million, up from 194.5 million the previous season.

<HEAD>Average Cost of Lawyer for Poor Defendant Now $223</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it now costs an
average of $223 to provide legal representation for a poor criminal
defendant, and the number requiring such services has risen sharply
since 1982.
   The Bureau of Justice Statistics said Monday the $223 cost, the
average in 1986, is up from $196 per case in 1982. The caseload
rose to nearly 4.5 million, up about 40 percent from the 3.2
million cases four years earlier, the bureau said in a report.
   The 50 states and Washington, D.C., spent a combined $991
million for indigent defendants in 1986, compared to $625 million
in 1982 _ an increase of 60 percent. The programs are financed by
state, county and local governments in each state.
   The rights of poor criminal defendants to legal representation
were spelled out in a number of Supreme Court rulings beginning in
1932.
   One case was the landmark Gideon vs. Wainright in 1963, when the
court extended the right to counsel in state courts to all indigent
defendants charged with a felony.
   Some states have expanded the program to include representation
for proceedings involving parole, probation, parental rights, civil
commitment and post-conviction matters.
   The department said Arkansas spent the least for indigent
defendants _ an average of 69 cents per state resident. The
District of Columbia spent the most, $29 per capita.
   The average per capita expenditure nationwide was $4.11 in 1986,
up from $2.76 in 1982.
   When average costs per indigent case were computed, Arkansas
again was last, spending $63 per case in 1986. New Jersey was
first, spending an average of $540.
   There are three basic programs used to provide the legal
services.
   Assigned counsel programs feature case-by-case appointments of
lawyers; in contract programs, the government contracts with
individual lawyers, law firms or local bar associations to provide
services for a given period; and in public defender programs, a
salaried staff is hired to provide legal services.
   The report was an update to a 1982 study on indigent defendants.
Since the initial study, the report said, there was a movement from
county to state financing; an increase in rates of compensation
paid to private lawyers, and expanded use of contracts for
providing representation to the poor.
   Here are the total state-by-state expenditures (including

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Whistle-Blower's Victory May Not Bode Well For
Others</HEAD>

   A victory that could give $800,000 to a fired
government whistle-blower sets precedents that he and his lawyers
fear will make it riskier for other federal employees to expose
waste and hazards.
   Bertrand G. Berube, fired in 1983 after he accused the General
Services Administration of becoming ``the nation's slumlord,'' said
he will take early retirement in a settlement with the agency. He
had been GSA's top regional director, overseeing all major
government buildings in the Washington, D.C., area.
   Despite the settlement ordered by the Merit Systems Protection
Board, Berube said laws are needed to prevent the government from
punishing other employees who disclose overspending and dangerous
conditions and that the federal system to protect such
whistle-blowers actually worked against him.
   Berube, who says he is the highest ranking civil servant ever
fired for whistle-blowing, said federal employees should not think
they can duplicate what he did unless they have several hundred
thousand dollars to spend on attorneys. He was defended by a public
interest group that can afford to back only a fraction of those who
go against government employers, he said.
   ``If a government employee has that kind of money, they're
usually not working for the government,'' said Berube. Those who
think they can get help from the special government counsel set up
to protect whistle-blowers may find ``they're going to the
executioner when they think they're going to the doctor,'' he said.
   The special counsel for the merit board refused to take his case
and ended up testifying in Congress against him, saying there were
other grounds for firing him besides his criticism of waste, fire
danger and health hazards in federal buildings, Berube said.
   The GSA had claimed that Berube, who earned $64,000 a year
overseeing 7,000 employees, engaged in ``irresponsible
sensationalism'' in describing GSA's problems.
   Herb Koster, a spokesman for Gerald Carmen, former GSA
administrator who fired Berube, said Carmen would not comment on
the settlement signed Aug. 18. Carmen now heads the Federal Asset
Disposition Association.
   GSA spokesman Paul Costello said GSA officials also had no
comment on the agreement.
   Thomas Devine, legal director for the Government Accountability
Project which represents Berube and other government and private
industry whistle-blowers, said rulings by the merit board during
its consideration of Berube's case further inhibit whistle-blowing.
   ``Under the Berube standards, agencies have everything to gain
and nothing to lose by opening up a witch hunt on a
whistle-blower,'' he said.
   Devine said that under the precedent, government agencies are
allowed to look after-the-fact for reasons to justify a dismissal.
   The Berube settlement agreement with GSA precludes further
appeal by either side and says the settlement does not assume any
``unlawful personnel practice, discrimination, reprisal or any
other unlawful or illegal acts'' by the agency or its officials.
   Devine said neither the merit board nor the courts have done
anything to discourage government reprisals against whistle-blowing
employees.
   The merit board's office of special counsel, which was set up to
represent whistle-blowers, ``actually has been a Troan horse for
civil servants who commit the truth,'' he said.
   Berube said in a telephone interview over the weekend that
problems with government buildings have gotten ``worse rather than
better'' since he was fired, with many buildings in serious
disrepair while money is wasted. In a May 1983 memo, he had said 25
percent of GSA buildings were unsafe and ``for all practical
purposes, we're becoming the nation's slumlord.''
   Berube said he agreed not to go back to the agency so he could
continue his successful woodworking business in Washington and
continue to fight for whistle-blower legislation.
   GSA spokesman Costello said Friday that a check for $530,000
would shortly be made out to Berube and his lawyers.
   Berube, 55, said that after legal fees he will get about
$350,000, along with up to $430,000 in additional retirement pay
based on his normal life expectancy. Lawyers said GSA also will
have to pay $24,000 into Berube's retirement account and reimburse
the $6,000 paid him in unemployment compensation.
   Berube said he would retire with a $32,500 annual pension, based
on 26 years of government service, including the five years since
he was fired. Berube said that without the settlement he would have
received annual retirement pay of $18,000 when he turns 65.
   A whistle-blower protection bill has passed the Senate. House
leaders are discussing whether to consider similar legislation
passed by a House committee or a Reagan administration bill opposed
by whistle-blowers.

<HEAD>Brady's Wife Says Reagan Reaffirms Support for Gun Wait Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sarah Brady, whose husband was shot along with
President Reagan, says Reagan recently reaffirmed to her that he
supports a mandatory waiting period for the purchase of handguns.
   The wife of presidential press secretary James Brady said she
reminded Reagan in a telephone conversation that John W. Hinckley
Jr. shot him and Brady in March 1981 with a gun purchased in a
state _ Texas _ without a waiting period.
   Mrs. Brady said Reagan endorsed the concept of a federal waiting
period, but not the specific language in a comprehensive anti-drug
bill that the House will consider this week _ and likely pass.
   ``He recognized the need for federal legislation,'' Mrs. Brady
said, after she told him that states ``are not doing the job'' in
stopping drug dealers from obtaining handguns.
   Debate on the overall drug bill begins Wednesday, and a final
vote could take place Friday. The Senate will then follow with its
own drug bill and the two versions would eventually be merged into
final legislation.
   The House bill as introduced would carry a $1.5 billion to $2
billion annual price tag, money that would be added to the $3.9
billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight drug
use.
   The legislation includes something for everyone involved in
fighting illegal drugs: more money for education, treatment and
rehabilitation; more resources for state and local law enforcement
efforts to seize drugs on land, in the air and on the seas.
   Strict controls would be placed for the first time on the
chemicals used as raw materials in the manufacture of heroin and
cocaine.
   There will be controversies over Republican-inspired amendments
for a federal death penalty against those who kill during a drug
crime; a ``good faith'' exception that would allow use of illegally
seized drug evidence in court, and denial of many federal benefits
for convicted drug users.
   The gun language would require a seven-day wait in the purchase
of a handgun from a licensed dealer.
   The dealer must send law enforcement authorities a sworn
statement that includes a description of the gun, the serial
number, the name, address and birth date of the buyer.
   Police may, but are not required, to conduct a background check.
   Purchasers who would be denied the pistol would be those already
ineligible under existing federal law: convicted felons, fugitives
from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, those adjudicated
mentally ill or committed to a mental institution, those
dishonorably discharged from the military and people under
indictment for a felony.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said he will offer an amendment to
substitute a requirement that the Justice Department establish a
computerized system to identify felons trying to purchase handguns.
Access would be provided to local police and firearms dealers.
   ``I don't think you should have a waiting period when it
abridges the right to buy a gun'' for a law-abiding citizen,
McCollum said.
   Reagan first weighed in on the subject of waiting periods on
June 21. The former California governor spoke favorably of
California's 15-day waiting period with a mandatory background
check, and added, ``Now, I would like to see that generally. I
think that all states ought to take a look at that system.''
   Mrs. Brady, who became a gun-control activist after her
husband's shooting, said she wrote Reagan thanking him for the
remarks, and he called her a week later. She brought up the federal
waiting period during the conversation.
   ``He wished it could be handled by the states,'' she said, but
added that Reagan was willing to have a federal law ``because of
the overwhelming problem'' of drug dealers and other criminals
obtaining guns.
   ``I told him we were trying to get that attached to the drug
bill,'' Mrs. Brady said. ``I told him there is overwhelming
evidence through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that
guns used in crimes are traced back to states where there is no
waiting period. I indicated Hinckley's gun came from a state,
Texas, where there is no waiting period.''
   Other key provisions of the drug bill would:
   _Require states to automatically ``pass through'' anti-drug
money to local governments.
   _Revise banking laws to allow the government to closely watch
institutions where drug money might be laundered.
   _Require recipients of federal grants or contracts to maintain a
drug-free workplace.
   _Provide money for drug education, treatment and rehabilitation
for AIDS victims and groups with a high risk of getting the disease.
   _Authorize $10 million for a Latin American regional anti-drug
force if one is approved by the Organization of American States.

<HEAD>Time Running Out on Environmental Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has left itself about a month to
solve major environmental problems that have eluded solution in the
1980s _ redoubling the battle against urban air pollution and
launching an attack on acid rain.
   Lawmakers return to town Wednesday, shooting for an early
October adjournment. As the House and Senate enter the home
stretch, clean air legislation is barely out of the starting gate.
   Neither chamber has even scheduled debate on the Clean Air Act
revisions that are being watched closely by some 100 cities and
metropolitan areas that failed to meet last December's deadline for
bringing ozone and carbon monoxide levels within national health
standards.
   A comprehensive package to control urban smog, acid rain and
airborne toxic chemicals was ready for Senate debate last November,
but it has been stalled by a variety of opponents, most notably
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The package's principal sponsor, Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine,
has been trying to negotiate floor time with Byrd. Mitchell has
said that if necessary, he will offer his air bill as an amendment
to must-pass legislation.
   In the House, serious closed-door negotiations among leaders of
the Energy and Commerce Committee didn't begin until this summer,
leaving little time to get a complicated proposal ready for the
floor.
   Any package produced by Congress would most likely give cities
more time to clean up their air but also require tougher actions to
combat pollution, from local driving restrictions to stricter
emissions standards for vehicles.
   Debate, a good bit of it in scientific terms, centers on how
much more time will be granted and just what corrective steps will
be required. A complicating factor is that the nation has already
employed the measures that can bring large and quick reductions in
pollution.
   Acid rain control is simpler scientifically but far more
complicated economically and geographically.
   Acid rain, a byproduct of coal-burning factories and power
plants, is a major concern of the East, which is downwind from the
industrial Midwest. Just who pays to clean up Midwestern emissions
is a major question, with many Western lawmakers cool to a national
subsidy for Midwestern cleanup costs.
   Byrd not only has power plants in his state that would have to
reduce their emissions, his state has huge deposits of high sulfur
coal that could lose its market to cleaner burning coal from other
states under an acid rain control bill.
   Congress has a fallback option if it fails to produce clean air
legislation. It can, as it did last December, pass another stopgap
bill that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from
taking action against areas not meeting the standards.
   The environment surfaced as an issue last week in the
presidential race between Republican George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis. Bush claimed to be highly committed to a cleaner
environment, although the record of the Reagan-Bush administration
has been given dismal marks by environmental groups.
   The clean air fight is at the top of the
environment-conservation agenda for the 100th Congress, but other
issues are vying for attention in the closing weeks of the
election-year session.
   One that might not take much time is the early 1987 request by
the Reagan administration and the oil industry to allow petroleum
exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Alaska's
north coast.
   The Senate Energy and House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
committees have endorsed drilling bills, but the House Interior
Committee, where the environmental lobby has more clout, is sitting
on the House bill.
   Likely to emerge from Capitol Hill after a four-year struggle is
a renewal of the Endangered Species Act authorizing a 50 percent
increase in program spending in the early 1990s.
   Congress is also ready to pass a $9.8 billion fiscal 1989
spending bill for the Interior Department and other land and
resource agencies. It is drawing veto threats because it would
delay spending for clean-coal technology research and bar oil
leasing off portions of the coasts of California, Massachusetts and
Florida.
   House and Senate negotiators are putting the finishing touches
on legislation that would encourage the use of less-polluting
methanol, ethanol and natural gas as alternatives to imported
petroleum for powering vehicles.
   Awaiting Senate action are House-passed bills that would
reorganize the National Park Service to make its director
independent of political appointees in the Interior Department; cut
back on commercial timbering in the Tongass National Forest in
Alaska; and prevent a shopping center from being built adjacent to
the Manassas National Battlefield Park in northern Virginia.

<HEAD>Quayle Has Patriotic Campaign Season Opener</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a week of refining his message and
selling it to friendly audiences, Republican vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle is home preparing for the fall campaign
following a patriotic season opener at the Statue of Liberty.
   Quayle is spending time with his family today and holds staff
meetings Wednesday before taking a quick swing to Illinois and Ohio
at week's end.
   The Indiana senator delivered a Labor Day tribute Monday to the
Pledge of Allegiance, which the Republicans have attempted to turn
into a political weapon against Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis.
   Quayle blasted Dukakis for vetoing a Massachusetts bill that
would have penalized teachers who did not lead their students in
the pledge.
   The values embodied in the pledge ``deserve to be transmitted to
our children,'' Quayle said.
   ``To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' he said.
   Quayle also toured Ellis Island, where millions of immigrants
entered the country and which is now undergoing restoration. The
Quayles are of Scottish descent and their relatives did not come
through Ellis Island. But the couple and their three children posed
for photographs anyway with a group of people dressed in costumes
of their native countries.
   Quayle's speech at the base of Lady Liberty, with the Manhattan
skyline in the background and Ellis Island nearby, was planned as a
moving kickoff to the countdown to Election Day.
   But it was disrupted briefly by about 30 demonstrators, members
of a coalition that believes the Reagan administration and Quayle
have not done enough in the fight against AIDS.
   Quayle's aides said later that the senator had an ``exemplary
record'' on AIDS issues and had recently voted to provide $1.2
billion in funding for AIDS research, education and prevention.
   The demonstrators, however, said Quayle voted against
legislation to give the experimental drug AZT to AIDS victims.
   Quayle's speech outlined what will be his themes this fall: the
economy is doing well, inflation and interest rates are under
control, and earnings and job growth are up.
   Quayle's task will be to sell the voters on the idea that they
will enjoy a bright future if they stick with the Republicans,
according to campaign strategists. That was the message Quayle had
for the Liberty Island crowd.
   ``We will win this election because we are the party of the
future. We believe in our families. We believe in the future and we
believe in preserving freedom in this country. We will never let it
go,'' he said.
   It was the same message Quayle worked on last week during his
Southern campaign swing, speaking before largely sympathetic
audiences on conservative college campuses and elsewhere in the
deep South.
   But Quayle is also beginning to get some less receptive crowds
as he ventures outside conservative territory.
   On Monday, he got a mixed reception when he dropped into Detroit
to address Polish-Americans after a parade. The audience booed and
heckled him as he spoke, although he did get a cheer when he
declared, ``We will never give up until there's freedom again in
Poland.''

<HEAD>California S&L Bailout to be Most Costly Ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's $2 billion bailout of
American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., will be
the most costly rescue ever of a single savings institution.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced the plan on Monday,
with chairman M. Danny Wall saying the agency will provide $500
million in promissory notes and at least another $1.5 billion in
cash assistance over the next 10 years.
   The California S&L was the nation's largest insolvent savings
institution. The largest previous rescue of a single savings and
loan was the $1.3 billion infusion last November into Vernon
Savings and Loan Association in Texas.
   The Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, will infuse $550
million in private funds and assume control of the California
institution, which is owned by Financial Corp. of America, Irvine,
Calif. The bank board will own 30 percent of the institution and
will receive 75 percent of the tax benefits arising from the
transaction.
   Wall said Bass and negotiators for the bank board struck a deal
late Friday and the board approved the agreement shortly after
midnight on Saturday. He said the board decided to delay announcing
it so the news would appear in newspapers on a business day.
   Wall said he expected the deal to be signed within ``a few days
to a couple weeks'' after the IRS approves the distribution of tax
benefits in the transaction and California officials approve a
state charter for the reconstituted institution.
   Wall said regulators had agreed to provide cash assistance
through the 10-year agreement, and that there was no upper limit on
the assistance. He said $2 billion is the bank board's best
estimate of its ultimate cost of the rescue after it sells its
stake in the S&L, which Wall said should occur within less than
five years, and reaps its share of the tax benefits.
   ``We gave some and they gave some. ... I don't think we have
given away the store by any means,'' he said.
   Financial Corp. of America, with $30.2 billion in assets at the
end of June, is the nation's second-largest thrift holding company,
after Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. It has been S&L
regulators' biggest problem for four years.
   Financial Corp. first came under regulatory scrutiny in 1984
when it suffered a $6.8 billion run on deposits that sent shock
waves through the industry.
   Another $490 million deposit run in the first two months of this
year prompted regulators in March to promise to protect all of
American's depositors, even those with more than the $100,000
insurance limit.
   The old management resigned in August 1984 and William Popejoy,
the current FCA chairman, was installed. But the company continued
to lose money on its portfolio of soured loans, which had
accumulated during FCA's rapid expansion in 1983 and 1984. Most of
it was secured by real estate in California and the
economically-troubled oil country of Texas.
   In the first six months of this year, FCA reported losses of
$223.7 million. Still, with enough federal assistance, American,
FCA's largest holding, has been considered a valuable purchase
because of its broad access through 186 branches and 23 loan
centers to the lucrative California market.
   The bank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 S&Ls, had
been negotiating exclusively since April 21, with the Bass Group,
the investment arm of a member of a wealthy Texas family.
   The exclusive arrangement has drawn criticism from members of
Congress and executives of the San Francisco-based First Nationwide
Bank, a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Co.
   First Nationwide had unsuccessfully sought for nearly a year to
acquire American before talks with regulators broke off.
   The FCA rescue is the latest in a series of large transactions
beginning in mid-August to clean up insolvent thrift associations.
   Since Aug. 18, the bank board has committed $12.2 billion in
aid, including the FCA deal, to rescue 47 savings institutions: 21
in Texas, 14 in Oklahoma, five in Minnesota, two others in
California and one each in Florida, Iowa, Idaho and Tennessee.
   So far this year, the bank board has resolved the cases of 96
insolvent institutions, compared with 48 last year.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen is stepping up his attacks on the Republicans while
hammering home the Democratic theme that the U.S. economy can do
better and distribute the benefits more fairly.
   ``I think you'll see a more aggressive campaign,'' Bentsen told
reporters on Monday. He then went on to criticized Vice President
George Bush as someone who gets his economic advice at
``Disneyland.''
   Bentsen was visiting a job training program today in
Lawrenceville, Ga., where people are taught to make computer
circuit boards. He later planned to visit Virginia Polytechnic
Institute in Blacksburg, Va., before returning this evening to
Washington.
   The visits appeared to be aimed directly at Republican positions
_ GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle's sponsorship of a jobs
training bill and George Bush's statement that he wanted to be
``the education president.''
   Beginning his fall campaign on Labor Day in his native Texas,
Bentsen attacked Bush and Quayle as operating ``on autopilot'' when
the nation needs to compete more aggressively in world markets.
   Echoing Democratic presidential nominee Mike Dukakis, he said
ideology is not the issue.
   ``The Republicans like to talk about left and right. But this
election is not about moving left or right,'' he said. ``It is
about standing still with George Bush or moving forward with Mike
Dukakis.''
   Bentsen, speaking to a partisan Democratic rally in Beaumont,
ridiculed Bush's statement that the Republicans would create 30
million new jobs, noting there were only 6 million people out of
work.
   ``I understand George Bush is out at Disneyland today. I think
he's out there talking to his economist,'' he said.
   Bentsen told reporters traveling with him that he expected to
take Texas and win the national election, but he acknowledged the
Democrats were revising their tactics.
   ``You can't keep taking the kind of attacks that we saw,'' such
as Bush's repeated suggestions that Dukakis was unpatriotic.
   The Texas senator's events on Labor Day were boastfully
patriotic. His speech in Beaumont was given standing before a huge
American flag, and when he met Dukakis for a picnic in St. Louis
later in the day, the thousands of spectators had been handed
little flags.
   Bentsen's trip to Atlanta was his first campaign appearance in
Georgia since he received the vice presidential nomination at the
Democratic National Convention in July. Bentsen had planned to
visit Atlanta on his last campaign trip, but was forced to cancel
when his campaign plane was grounded.
   Bentsen's spokesman, Mike McCurry, acknowledged that the
Democrats were behind in the polls in both Georgia and Virginia but
said with help from state Democratic officials they think there is
a chance to reverse that by election day.

   A propane tank exploded Monday at a nudist
camp, igniting a blaze that injured two people, forced 300 to flee
and destroyed nine buildings and four vehicles, authorities said.
   About 150 of the people are permanent residents of the 53-acre
Tree House Fun Ranch, 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, where
the blaze broke out shortly before 3 p.m.
   ``The fire started in the brush and spread to the other areas,''
said San Bernardino County fire Capt. Steve Dale.
   Two of the ranch's homeowners were injured. Rocco Lollo, whose
age was not immediately known, suffered burns over 50 percent of
his body and was to be released after treatment at a hospital, said
Lesley Dale, a county fire department spokeswoman. An unidentified
woman suffered minor injuries, Ms. Dale said.
   The fire burned three acres before being contained at about 4:30
p.m., Dale said. Two homes were destroyed and three were damaged.
Seven outside structures were razed, along with four vehicles. The
damage was estimated at $250,000, said Ms. Dale.
   The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but arson
was ruled out, she added. People were allowed to return to the camp
by 10 p.m.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Libyan Leader Denies Terror Links, Wants To Visit United
States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi says his
country and the Soviet Union are moving in the same progressive
direction and contends his ideas of socialist reform have
influenced Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In an interview Monday with The Associated Press, Gadhafi also
challenged anyone to prove U.S. accusations that he sponsors
terrorism and said his relations with Washington may improve under
George Bush or Michael Dukakis.
   Asked about Libya's relations with the Soviet Union, its chief
arms supplier, Gadhafi said: ``We are very close to each other,
friends, we respect the policy of each other's side.''
   ``Both of us are going in the same direction in the progression
of socialism,'' Gadhafi said, adding: ``I believe Gorbachev is
affected by the Green Book.''
   The Green Book is a collection of the colonel's philosophy on
the ``revolution'' he has led in Libya since coming to power 19
years ago this month in a coup.
   Gadhafi fielded questions in his office at the Bab el-Aziziya,
or Heavenly Gate, military compound in Tripoli. Soldiers were
posted in watchtowers nearby and tanks were housed in camouflaged
garages. The entire area was ringed by walls topped with rows of
barbed-wire coils.
   The 46-year-old colonel _ dressed in a gold floor-length cape,
green suede shirt and white slacks _ sat at a polished cherry desk,
with glass and wood bookcases behind him.
   He said he would like to visit the United States ``if things
were different'' and charaterized Americans who believe President
Reagan's charge that he sponsors terrorism are ``very simple
people, ignorant people.''
   ``I challenge everyone in the world to give evidence'' that
Libya backs terrorism, he said, speaking English in the interview.
   Reagan accused Gadhafi of sponsoring the December 1985 attacks
that left 20 people dead at airports in Rome and Vienna.
   U.S. warplanes bombed Libya in April 1986 in an attack that
killed 37 people, including Gadhafi's 15-month-old adopted
daughter. The raid was intended to punish Libya for its role in the
April 5 bombing of a West German nightclub in which two American
soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed.
   A July 11 terrorist attack that killed nine people on a Greek
cruise ship was linked to Abu Nidal, who is believed to travel
frequently to Libya.
   ``Of course, we are against imperialism, racism and Zionism,''
said Gadhafi. ``We are not wrong, we are right to defend our
interests.
   ``We are ready to improve our relations with America if the
policy of America is changed. I expect this relation to improve.''
   Earlier Monday, Gadhafi was asked whether he preferred
Republican nominee George Bush or Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis as president of the United States.
   ``The one I would back would lose,'' Gadhafi said laughing.
   Last spring, Gadhafi told an American television news crew that
Bush would be a ``better president because he has suffered with
Reagan and he would sort of make up for it.'' Bush then said of the
endorsement, ``I could have done without it. I'm going to ask him
to reconsider.''
   In conversations with foreigners, Gadhafi has inquired about the
background of both presidential candidates.
   Gadhafi said on Monday he expects U.S. foreign policy to change
under the next administration, but did say how.

   With 25,000 firefighters in the West, the
logistics of supplying all of them is staggering, say officials of
the federal center established to do just that.
   As of Monday, the Boise Interagency Fire Center has sent out
50,000 pairs of fire retardant gloves, 25,445 pairs of flame-proof
trousers and nearly 32,000 paper sleeping bags.
   It also has distributed 41,607 canteens, 30,984 shirts, nearly
3,000 cans of foot powder, 15 pocket dictionaries, and for
firefighters' internal blazes, 182 bottles of antacid.
   The center, established in 1965, is responsible for dispatching
firefighters, aircraft and supplies to state and federal agencies
throughout the country.
   More than 67,000 fires, burning a record of more than 3.6
million acres, have been reported in the United States this year.
The previous record was 3.2 million acres in 1985.
   ``This has been a very long fire season,'' said Arnold Hartigan,
public affairs officer. ``It began early in June and now, almost
three months later, it shows no signs of letting up.''
   Labor Day was typical of the workload. While about 10 people
might be on duty on a normal Labor Day, Hartigan said about 150
were working at center this year.
   The fire management center is made up of personnel from the
Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, National Park
Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Through the weekend, the center has sent out 2.3 million pounds
of supplies, valued at about $14 million.
   Along with the other necessities, Hartigan said, 103,000 message
forms have been distributed to firefighters.
   ``This is ... the government, and we do need to keep up on our
paperwork,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The government says it arrested a
54-year-old Belgian air force colonel on suspicion of spying for an
East European nation for profit, and that the suspect had confessed.
   Defense Minister Guy Coeme announced Monday that the suspect,
Col. Guy Binet, had access to documents of the Belgian army and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and was believed to have started
spying for a Soviet bloc country two years ago. He did not identify
the country.
   ``At first sight it does not seem that the documents that he
might have passed on are of a nature to destabilize the NATO
strategy or apparently have extremely important implications for
the national defense,'' Coeme told reporters.
   He said Binet was arrested Saturday and had confessed. But he
did not say what Binet had told investigators or where the suspect
was being held.
   Coeme said it appeared that Binet was driven by profit rather
than ideological reasons.
   ``He worked on his own and in direct contact with the foreign
power,'' the minister said, and apparently received tens of
thousands of dollars for the information he provided.
   A search of Binet's house yielded material ``that certainly had
to be used for espionage'' including a foreign-made suitcase with a
secret compartment and special photographic material, Coeme said.
   ``We have a list of documents that were sought by the foreign
power,'' he added. `` We do not know whether these documents have
been provided but the documents concerned the Belgian army and NATO
strategy.''
   Binet was two years away from retirement.
   He was charged with treason and ``infractions against the
external security of the state'' according to Coeme. If convicted
Binet could be sentenced to life in prison.
   Coeme said NATO authorities had been informed of the arrest.
   Binet worked for the air force purchasing department and had
access to files on the U.S. F-16 jet fighter and contracts for the
acquisition of helicopters for the Belgian army.
   Coeme said military authorities began investigating Binet a year
ago after the colonel ``aroused suspicion.'' He did not elaborate.
   Binet was questioned Friday and arrested Saturday, the minister
said.
   He said the case could lead to diplomatic problems between
Belgium and the unidentified East European nation.

<HEAD>`Domino Effect' Seen Among Ailing Inner City Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inner city hospitals collapsing in financial
failure are likely to topple their ailing neighbors in a ``domino
effect'' hastened by growing tides of poor and eroding government
support, medical authorities say.
   Rural hospitals are shutting down at an equal rate and are
leaving large gaps in the availability of health care, the
authorities say.
   Last week, a 437-bed hospital in Chicago and a 30-bed
institution in rural southwestern Illinois announced they would
close, becoming casualties in an accelerating national trend.
   ``It's a fragile environment for hospitals,'' says Jan Shulman,
a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association, which tallied
a record 79 hospital closings nationwide last year.
   In Illinois, for example, five closed in 1987. Twenty-five of
the state's 226 remaining hospitals fit the profile of endangered
institutions, most in Chicago and one in East St. Louis, said
Kenneth Robbins, president of the Illinois Hospital Association.
   Typically, the shaky hospitals are in poor, inner-city
neighborhoods, with 25 percent of their patients poor people
covered under Medicaid, 30 percent to 40 percent elderly people
covered under Medicare, and 5 percent to 10 percent indigent people
with no way of paying, Robbins said.
   The state pays hospitals only 73 cents for every dollar they
spend treating Medicaid patients, and the federal government pays
only 90 cents for every dollar spent treating Medicare patients, he
said.
   ``Nearly 60 percent of all community hospitals lost money
providing patient-care services in 1986,'' Ms. Shulman said. She
noted that the number of uninsured people has risen from 33 million
in 1983 to 37 million.
   ``There's a certain domino effect that accompanies the closing
of any hospital,'' Robbins said. If a neighboring hospital has been
treating many poor patients, ``and it has to absorb even more, the
additional load could be the straw that breaks the back of that
hospital.''
   Edward Duffy, outgoing director of the Illinois Department of
Public Aid, says surplus beds as much as inadequate government
support are to blame for much of the trouble. He cited the
soon-to-be closed St. Anne's Hospital as an example, noting that it
has been using only about one-quarter of its 437 beds.
   ``Hospitals like St. Anne's are the steel mills of the hospital
industry,'' Duffy said after the hospital announced its closing
last week. ``People don't use hospitals like they used to. I could
have tripled my rates (of Medicaid reimbursement) but that would
not have kept that hospital open.''
   ``I totally disagree,'' said Robbins, adding that St. Anne's
scaled back on beds as an appropriate response to falling demand.
``In the final analysis, it was inadequate payment that killed
them, not just ... this year or last year, but over a period of
years.''
   Inner city hospitals are not alone in these difficulties.
   Texas, whose 43 hospital closings since the beginning of 1987
are the most for any state during the period, sees most of the
shutdowns among tiny rural hospitals, said Ann Ward Rogers, a
spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association.
   Besides inadequate government reimbursement and falling
occupancy rates, rural hospitals have trouble attracting qualified
doctors and nurses, she said in a telephone interview last week
from Austin.
   Texas has 48 counties with no hospital, Mrs. Rogers said, noting
that residents of such counties must travel to seek health care.
   ``If it's a non-emergency situation that may be OK, but if it's
a life-threatening situation, that might be too far,'' she said.
   Robbins said solutions to the problem will come only through
more adequate Medicaid and Medicare financing; better incentives
for physicians to treat poor patients in their offices, relieving
the burden of indigent patients on hospitals; and better provision
of nursing home care.
   That will require more activism than in the past, according to
Earl Bird, president of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare
Council, an organization of 96 hospitals.
   ``Individuals and agencies that represent the poor and elderly
have got to tell their legislators that we can't afford any more
underfinancing,'' he said. ``And the legislators have got to
respond, or there are going to be more closures.''

   Paramilitary police, some carrying truncheons,
broke up a demonstration and arrested protesters marking the 70th
anniversary of the launching of a Bolshevik campaign to stifle
political opposition.
   At least 100 police officers, occasionally aided by civilian
auxiliary police, also detained some pedestrians who shouted that
the arrests were ``a disgrace.''
   Monday's demonstration was on the 70th anniversary of the ``Red
Terror,'' the Bolshevik campaign that decreed ``class enemies''
should be put in concentration camps and political opponents shot.
   The demonstration in downtown Pushkin Square was called by the
Democratic Union, an unofficial political group.
   Reporters saw five people arrested and put into buses. Tass, the
official news agency, said 17 members of the Democratic Union were
detained and a court would decide punishment.
   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, said none
of the members had been in touch with him by late Monday, and
interpreted that to mean they still were in jail.
   During the demonstration, police hauled away an elderly woman
and arrested a man after he put a black ribbon over his mouth,
apparently to symbolize that authorities prevented freedom of
speech.
   It was not clear whether the man or the woman belonged to the
Democratic Union.
   More than 100 people gathered around the woman as she spoke of
being jailed and sent to internal exile years ago.
   When a police officer yelled ``Disperse!'' a column of about 50
policemen forced the crowd aside and grabbed the woman.
   The Democratic Union called the demonstration to remember the
``Red Terror,'' which began with the Sept. 5, 1918 decree against
opponents.
   That started government repression of political dissidents, the
Democratic Union said in a statement, and serves to show that only
a multiparty system and pluralistic economy can safeguard human
rights.
   On Aug. 21, the Democratic Union tried to demonstrate in Pushkin
Square against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechsolovakia 20 years
earlier. Police broke up the rally, arresting more than 100 people.
   Protesters said later they were beaten at the police station.
   A dozen police officers carried rubber truncheons Monday but did
not appear to use them on demonstrators.
   Tass said the program the Democratic Union calls the ``Red
Terror'' was necessary and all revolutionary regimes use such
measures to protect themselves from ``external and internal
enemies.''

   A summer marred by fouled beaches, drought and sweltering heat
came to its unofficial Labor Day finale with frustrated beachgoers
demonstrating against pollution, and a nip in the air over much of
the nation.
   Millions of Americans attended parades, foods fests and
political rallies Monday. And though labor seems to have little to
do with Labor Day 106 years after the holiday's inauguration, some
people were even on the job.
   In Southern California, a third day of sizzling heat over 100
degrees drove an estimated 1 million people to beaches.
   ``It's pretty much a towel-to-towel beach gridlock out there by
the water,'' said Malibu lifeguard Bill Barker, estimating that
more than 200,000 sunbathers hit the beach.
   But east of the upper Mississippi Valley, afternoon temperatures
remained below 70 degrees.
   The city-owned Wave Pool in Nashville, Tenn., drew only about 30
people as the temperature rose to the high 60s. The normal Labor
Day crowd is 1,000.
   As night fell, frost advisories were issued in Minnesota and
Wisconsin.
   A human chain of about 1,000 people stretched across two Long
Island, N.Y., beaches, singing ``America the Beautiful'' and
calling for an end to ocean dumping. Medical waste and other debris
has washed ashore this summer from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of
Mexico, ruining vacations for hundreds of thousands of people.
   Others spent Labor Day laboring. But they didn't seem to mind.
   ``I feel working on Labor Day is appropriate,'' said Pam
Pettegrew, a receptionist at the Boston Harbor Hotel.
   In Baltimore, Archbishop William Borders honored workers with
the Blessing of the Tools at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen.
Rank-and-file members of unions placed the tools of their trades at
the altar.
   In the West, forest fires interfered with Labor Day traditions
for some outdoorsmen. Yellowstone National Park _ full of smoke _
closed roads and campgrounds, some public forests closed, and the
governors of Montana and Utah asked people to voluntarily stay out
of the tinder-dry woods.
   Thousands swarmed to the third annual Railroad Days celebration
at Topeka, Kan., an observance of the role the Santa Fe and Union
Pacific played in the city's history. Tickets were sold out weeks
for rides on a 1940s vintage train.
   Lawrence, Mass., held its fourth-annual Bread and Roses Heritage
Day Festival. The celebration, marked by a parade and concerts by
folk singer Odetta and others, commemorates the Great Strike of
1912 against textile mills, also known as the Bread and Roses
Strike.
   Labor Day's role as the traditional end to the summer season was
seen in Maine, where southbound traffic reached more than 3,400
vehicles an hour on the Maine Turnpike as vacationers left the
state.
   Entertainer Jerry Lewis conducted his annual telethon drive for
the Muscular Dystrophy Association, raising a record $41,132,113.
   Dallas marked Labor Day with a 12-hour sampling festival with
food from 40 restaurants and a downtown celebration that included
live music and entertainment, with proceeds donated to Lewis'
telethon.
   On Chicago's Northwest Side, thousands gathered at the Taste of
Polonia festival to eat sausage, play bingo and listen to polka
bands and an Elvis impersonator.
   The weekendlong Rock `A' Rama in downtown Philadelphia
celebrated the fads, music and food of the 1950s. Jerry Lee Lewis,
Chubby Checker, Ben E. King, Carl Perkins, the Shangri-Las and
others were on the weekend's entertainment schedule.
   Labor Day also signaled a beginning _ of full-blown campaigns
for the Nov. 8 election.
   Michigan was a magnet for presidential politics as the
candidates skipped to rallies and parades across the country.
Democrat Michael Dukakis addressed a rally that followed Detroit's
three-hour Labor Day parade, and Republican Dan Quayle addressed
people who had gathered for the Polish Day parade at Hamtramck, a
Polish enclave in Detroit.
   George Bush stumped in vote-rich southern California.

   Hussein Musavi resigned Monday after
seven years as Iran's prime minister, but will remain as a
caretaker premier until a successor is named, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency on Tuesday quoted Tehran's Jomhuri Eslami daily,
which printed the full text of Musavi's letter of resignation to
President Ali Khamenei.
   In that letter, Musavi, 44, said he wanted to step down
primarily because he believed as many as eight of his Cabinet
members will fail to win a vote of confidence in the Majlis, Iran's
270-seat Parliament.
   The letter apparently did not specify why he believed that, but
But Musavi said his administration would not be able to function
with eight vacant Cabinet posts.
   Musavi did not identify the Cabinet members, who have been at
their posts since he carried out minor shuffles following two-stage
parliamentary elections in April and May.
   After that balloting, Musavi, a radical who has sought major
economic reforms in the face of bitter opposition from conservative
clerics, said he planned only minor changes in his cabinet.
   Jomhuri Eslami did not say whether Khamenei had accepted
Musavi's resignation, but IRNA said the president had apparently
done so.

<HEAD>94-Year-Old Former Teamsters President Sees Stronger Days For
Labor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Labor Day Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With 94 Labor Days under his belt, former
Teamsters chief Dave Beck sees stronger days ahead for organized
labor.
   ``Labor is strictly a business,'' Beck said. ``All I ever did in
the labor union movement was sell labor for the best price I could
get. And that's the only ... thing labor's got to sell, is labor.''
   Although statistics indicate the percentage of unionized workers
in the labor force is declining, Beck isn't worried.
   ``We're doing just fine,'' he said last week at his home in
suburban Lake Forest Park.
   ``Now, you take all these mergers. Sure, every time there's a
merger it does cut 200 or 300 jobs. But let it reverse _ and it
will _ and we'll reverse it (union representation), too.''
   Beck's own success was due as much to his own business deals as
his rise to the top of organized labor. He quit school in his early
teens to support his family by driving a laundry truck in Seattle,
and became a multimillionaire from real-estate investments.
   Some of his activities led to trouble. He spent 2{ years on
Internal Revenue Service charges at McNeil Island when it was a
federal penitentiary, and paid $1.3 million in back taxes and
penalties.
   Beck is largely unconcerned with that history. But he does
recall his days as reigning power in the Teamsters union, when
presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight
Eisenhower asked him to join their cabinets as secretary of labor.
He turned all down.
   ``Eisenhower said, `You can't say no to the president of the
United States,''' recalled Beck. ``I said `I not only can, I am.' ''
   Beck also oversaw the Teamsters' withdrawal from the American
Federation of Labor when the AFL merged with the Congress of
Industrial Organizations.
   ``The greatest mistake (former AFL chief George Meany) ever made
was throwing the Teamsters out, because the Teamsters didn't need
the AFL but the AFL sure needed the Teamsters,'' Beck said.
   Beck also has observations about the current scene, including
the Justice Department's recent civil lawsuit seeking to vacate
Teamsters union leadership to rid it of alleged corruption. It
``was definitely politics _ and bad politics'' that will never
reach trial, he predicted.
   ``How Ronald Reagan could do that to us I'll never understand,''
he said. ``I sat at the same table with him in our Hollywood days''
when Reagan was Screen Actors Guild president.
   There is no mob influence in today's unions, Beck said, and if
there is union racketeering going on, ``not one ounce of it goes on
west of Chicago.''
   ``I'm not here to say somewhere along the line you're not gonna
find some evidence (of illegality), but you can go right over to
Wall Street and find people who stole hundreds of millions of
dollars,'' he said.
   As for Beck himself, he said he hopes to see his 100th Labor
Day, ``and I plan to.''
   ``But,'' he added, ``I don't know that I'd bank on it.''

   Thousands of journalists across India
went on strike today to protest a proposed new defamation law they
say aims to curtail press freedom.
   All but one of New Delhi's 17 dailies carried front-page notices
announcing they would not publish Wednesday. The two national news
agencies, the Press Trust of India and the United News of India,
stopped working at 3 a.m. and said they would resume after the
24-hour strike.
   The proposed Defamation Act expands the concept of defamation
and negates the presumption of innocence of journalists or others
making disclosures. Newspapers branded it ``draconian,''
``fascist,'' and ``undemocratic.''
   The legislation would allow punishment of up to two years in
prison for first offenders and up to five years for subsequent
convictions. It shifts the burden of proof from plaintiff to
journalists and calls for speedy trials _ something not stipulated
for murder, treason or rape trials.
   Professional organizations and the political opposition called
the bill censorship in disguise, an attempt by Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi to muzzle the press following reports that top government
officials accepted millions of dollars in kickbacks from defense
purchases.
   ``The suspension of publication is an extreme step,'' the
anti-government Indian Express said in an editorial. But it said
the strike ``is bound to be just one in a long struggle against a
cabal which has lost its head.''
   Even the normally pro-government Hindustan Times newspaper said
it supported the strike. ``It will be honorable for the government
to admit its mistake and rectify it,'' it said in an editorial.
   Gandhi said he was ``fully convinced'' of the need for the bill.
   The Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, approved the
Defamation Act on Aug. 30.
   The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, was supposed to take up the
bill Monday, but Gandhi delayed consideration and appointed a
committee of seven Cabinet ministers to discuss the matter with
journalists.
   The bill must be passed by both houses and then signed by
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman before becoming law.
   Gandhi's move to delay consideration on the bill ``does not does
not fully meet the purport of the objections to and the grave
apprehensions about this draconian bill,'' said the leftist Patriot
newspaper.
   But the pro-government National Herald, the only New Delhi
newspaper which worked today, said: ``The government has shown it
has an open mind and that it does not stand on prestige. It is now
for all of us to display a constructive approach so that the
measure is discussed ... without any kind of acrimony.''

   Comedian Jerry Lewis says his 23rd-annual Labor
Day telethon was ``the wildest ride of emotions I've ever gone
through'' as he raised a record $41,132,113 in the 21{-hour
nationally broadcast program.
   Lewis had vowed to tug at the hearts of the 120 million viewers,
and did so with a parade of celebrities and poignant stories from
muscular dystrophy victims and their families.
   ``This is the wildest roller coaster I've ever been on, the
wildest ride of emotions I've ever gone through,'' Lewis said as
the tote board surpassed last year's record of $39,021,723.
   Lewis has been involved with the New York-based Muscular
Dystrophy Association for 39 years, beginning his annual Labor Day
telethons in 1966.
   The show featured appearances by corporate sponsors who
contributed $34,379,537, which was not included in the telethon's
final tote.
   Because of the longevity and the money raised to date _
$484,314,483 _ the annual Labor Day event has become known as
``the'' telethon.
   Lewis saved some of the most touching moments for the final
hours of the show, including a farewell to Mikey Neufeldt of New
Berlin, Wis., the MDA poster child the past two years.
   Researchers chronicled the progress that had been made during
the past year in fighting muscular dystrophy, a chronic,
non-contagious disease characterized by a progressive wasting of
the muscles.
   And celebrities such as Ann-Margret and her husband, Roger
Smith, appealed for help in fighting diseases that have touched
their lives.
   Smith suffers from myasthenia gravis, a sometimes fatal muscle
disease that is among the 40 targeted by the MDA.
   ``It is difficult to sit by and wait and hope'' while cures are
sought, his wife said.
   The show also featured a segment on Dennis Day, who died in June
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
   Two of Day's 10 children were featured on a tape with their
father as he talked of his hope of beating the disease.
   ``I could see it in his eyes,'' said son Tom McNulty. ``He was
afraid. I was afraid, too, afraid of losing him.''
   The telethon also featured some of the victims of muscular
dystrophy.
   Susan and Leonard DeStefano wept as they talked of the death of
their 6{-month-old girl from muscular dystrophy. DeStefano said his
daughter, weakened by the disease, didn't have the strength to
smile at him until the couple left her hospital bed for the last
time.
   ``I turned and she gave me this huge smile,'' DeStefano said,
weeping. ``That was Sarah's way of saying goodbye to me.''

   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen,
while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   The dollar, which opened at 136.25 yen, 0.22 yen higher than
Monday's close of 136.03, finished trading at 135.60 yen, down 0.43
yen, after moving in a range of 135.40-136.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
146.67 points Monday, finished at 27,320.51. Although the market's
main index gained 107.90 points early in the morning, share prices
fell 21.07 points, or 0.08 percent, by the end of the day.
   Cancer treatment-related issues led a market rebound early in
the morning session, but share prices could not maintain the surge
because the market lacks energy, Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko
securities said.
   Issues related to cancer treatment rose following newspaper
reports Tuesday morning of a discovery by Japanese researchers
differentiating human DNA that could normalize cancer cells.
   ``Some of the external factors around the stock market, such as
the dollar-yen rate, are getting better, but the market still has
domestic problems including concerns about insider trading,''
Shimoyama said.
   ``Players are mainly individual investors, and the trading was
thin because institutional investors were staying away,'' he added.
   On the foreign exchange, dealers said trading was cautious with
investors in a wait-and-see mood.
   They said most participants remained on the sidelines concerned
about what will happen to the New York market after its three-day
holiday.

<DATELINE>MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ruled by the world's youngest monarch,
tiny Swaziland marked 20 years of independence today as a nation
rich in tradition and largely free of the turbulence that plagues
its neighbors.
   Wedged between South Africa and Mozambique, this kingdom of
rolling hills and lush valleys has spent the past two decades
pursuing both Western-style modernization and preservation of
age-old customs.
   Progress means a new Coca-Cola bottling plant in the capital of
Mbabane, video cassette recorders in the expanding shops and luxury
tourist hotels.
   Tradition, meanwhile, calls for regular celebrations with
singing and dancing by bare-breasted maidens in tribute to
20-year-old spear-wielding King Mswati III and his mother, known as
the Great She Elephant.
   For these festive occasions, including a nine-hour independence
celebration planned today at the country's main stadium, both men
and women appear in traditional red, orange and yellow skirts, with
long strands of beads and feathers in their hair.
   The men carry animal skin shields, the women wear beehive
hairnets.
   The baby-faced king, who already has four wives, was barely four
months old when his nation received independence from Britain on
Sept. 6, 1968.
   Two years ago, he replaced his father, the late King Sobhuza II,
who ruled for 62 years and had at least 68 sons.
   Economically, landlocked Swaziland remains an agricultural
nation heavily dependent on South Africa, which borders it on three
sides.
   Thousands of Swazi men work in South Africa's mines and the vast
majority of Swaziland's imports reach the country via its powerful
neighbor.
   A handful of foreign firms that disinvested from South Africa _
such as Coca-Cola _ have moved their plants to Swaziland. Another
approach has been for firms in South Africa to falsely label their
goods as ``Made in Swaziland'' to evade embargoes against South
Africa.
   Canada has received ``Made in Swaziland'' wine, even though
there are no vineyards in Swaziland. Citrus produce amounting to
four times Swaziland's annual output has turned up with Swazi
labels in the Middle East.
   Swaziland's eastern neighbor, Mozambique, offers access to the
Indian Ocean and alternatives to South Africa transport routes. But
Mozambique's main contribution at present is an unwelcome one _
more than 100,000 refugees who have fled into Swaziland from famine
and civil war in their country.
   Swaziland, half the size of Belgium, has two refugee centers
designed to hold just a few thousand people.
   Aside from the refugees, who swell the country's population by
about 15 percent, Swaziland is ethnically homogenous and has
avoided the inter-tribal strife that has plagued many other African
countries.
   The relatively few indidents of political violence in recent
years generally have involved anti-apartheid activists and
guerrillas from South Africa, who on occasion have been targets of
cross-border raids and kidnappings by South African agents.
   The king and the royal family have the final say on all major
matters. But most day-to-day business is left in the hands of the
Cabinet, Parliament and the bureaucracy, which conduct the
political affairs with a distinctive Swazi touch.
   When the parliamentary electoral college was selected last
November, members were chosen by voters who passed through cattle
gates next to the candidate of their choice.
   When retired white farmer Rex Baxter and his wife arrived to
vote, policemen grabbed him, placed him at a gate and told him he
had been chosen as a candidate. While being whisked away for
week-long private consultations with the other winners, Baxter
shouted to his wife to bring his heart tablets and cigarettes from
home.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Signs Historic Pact To Give Indians Arctic Tract</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures U.S.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   RAE-EDZO, Northwest Territories (AP) _ Two native groups in the
Arctic will become the largest non-government landholders in North
America under a historic agreement signed by Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   The long-delayed agreement, signed in this tiny community 200
miles south of the Arctic Circle on the shores of Great Slave Lake,
will give the Denes and Metis Indian nations nearly 4,000 square
miles of land and special rights to an area the size of Oklahoma.
   Mulroney said the signing marked a ``day of justice'' and
heralds ``new economic and political development'' for the north.
But native leaders say many specifics must be negotiated before a
final pact is signed in two years.
   Monday's agreement gives about 15,000 natives of the Dene and
Metis Indian nations ownership and oil and mineral rights to about
3,850 square miles of the rocky bush land bordering the Arctic
Ocean.
   It would also give them special rights and interests _ including
a voice in wildlife, forestry and land management _ for a nearly
70,000 square miles area.
   The agreement, which followed 15 years of negotiations, includes
a $405 million cash settlement that would be paid out over 20 years
beginning in 1990 _ the year negotiators hope to have a final
settlement.
   ``This agreement of principle, when carried forward to its final
form, will establish a new, stronger and healthier relationship
between the people of this area and the governments which serve
them,'' said Mulroney, who was welcomed with the beat of drums and
a ceremonial prayer chant.
   He added that the agreement marks ``real progress'' in the Dene
quest for self-determination.
   But the chief of the Dene nation warned that Ottawa and native
leaders must still negotiate issues such as aboriginal title and
self-government.
   ``We will be seeking changes before we reach the final
agreement,'' Bill Erasmus told about 1,000 Dogrib Indians on the
steps of the village's Roman Catholic church.
   The Dogribs are the largest of seven groups making up the Dene
nation.
   Ottawa said the Dene handed over their aboriginal rights when
they signed 1899 and 1921 treaties.
   But the Dene contend they never gave up their aboriginal rights
and, under Monday's agreement, are handing over some of their land
in return for financial compensation and the guarantee of hunting
and fishing rights.
   Mike Paulette, president of the Northwest Territories Metis
Association, said he was sure ``we can now negotiate a satisfactory
deal within the next two years.''
   Mulroney's visit to Rae-Edzo, 65 miles northwest of the
territorial capital of Yellowknife, marked his first trip to the
Northwest Territories since his Conservatives gained power four
years ago.

   The dollar lost ground today, while share prices
edged down on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed lower at 135.60 yen, down 0.43 yen, following
Monday's loss of 0.72 yen. The currency moved in a range of
135.40-136.25 yen with spot trading estimated at $7.8 billion.
   Although the dollar lost ground the second time this week, the
dollar-selling drive was not strong, said a stock dealer at Daiwa
Securities in Tokyo.
   ``Although some investors sold the dollar to buy more yen, the
dollar-selling drive was not strong enough to let the rate go below
the 135.5-yen level,'' the dealer said.
   ``In addition, the (foreign exchange) market had less
participants today in a wait-and-see mood,'' he added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues suffered a
slight setback following a 146.67-point loss Monday, and dropped
another 21.07 points from Monday's close of 27,341.58.
   The market's main index gained 107.90 points as soon as the
trading began, but it could not keep the winning trend and
gradually fell lower to close at 27,320.51.
   Toshiyuki Nishiguchi of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo said many
investors are already in a cautious mood waiting for the scheduled
U.S. trade figure for July next week.
   In thin trading of 500 million shares, issues related to
pharmacauticals attracted participants.

<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To avoid possible controversy during
the Olympics, South Korea has temporarily halted foreign adoption
of its babies.
   The government has not officially confirmed the ban, but
adoption agencies acknowledged they were asked to stop sending
babies overseas for adoption for two months before and during the
Olympics, which run from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   South Korea sends about 7,000 children abroad annually for
adoption in the United States and Europe. Adoption officials say
South Korea is one of the easiest nations for overseas adoptions.
   ``We are getting a lot of complaints from foreign adoptive
parents, but we have to follow the government order,'' said one
senior official at a Seoul adoption agency, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   He said his agency alone would not be able to send 200 babies
for adoption in the United States during the two-month period.
   Baby adoption is an embarrassing issue for South Korea, with
critics saying that now that the nation has achieved prosperity it
should care for its orphans and other unwanted children.
   Overseas baby adoption began when South Korea was poor, its
economy devastated by the Korean War of 1950-53, and the government
encouraged the practice to help alleviate the country's social and
economic problems.
   Some unofficial estimates indicate that about 14,000 South
Korean babies are adopted at home and abroad each year. They are
given up for adoption by unwed mothers or abandoned by their
parents.
   Government officials refused to give out any figures or grant
interviews, but many social workers agree that South Korea probably
was the largest supplier of babies for adoption in the United
States in 1987.
   Social workers estimated that about half of the 12,000 foreign
babies adopted in the United States last year came from South Korea.
   Domestic adoption continues to be a problem, because most
Koreans value blood ties and do not want to take in unrelated
children.
   There are signs, however, that the problem could ease in several
years because the number of babies given up for adoption or
abandoned continues to decrease, social workers say.
   The changing trend is extending the waiting period for foreign
adoptions of Korean children from about 1{ years to 2{ years, they
said.
   About 80 percent of the babies given up for adoption are born to
unwed mothers and, social workers said, the government's active
birth control and other programs are helping reduce the number of
babies born out of wedlock.
   In Confucian-oriented Korean society, babies born out of wedlock
tend to be despised and considered castaways.
   Foreign adoptive parents now pay $4,000 in adoption fees that
include care costs, transporation and adoption processing expenses.

   Three hundred people left their clothes
behind as they fled a nudist camp when a propane gas tank exploded,
igniting a fire that injured two people and damaged several
buildings, authorities said.
   Residents of the Tree House Fun Ranch were nude when the fire
broke out Monday afternoon, said San Bernardino County Fire
dispatcher Martha Pfrommer.
   One naked woman flagged down a fire truck and directed it to the
blaze.
   ``It gave them pause at first,'' Ms. Pfrommer said of the
firefighters who answered the call. ``They haven't been to a fire
like that in recent memory.''
   About 150 of those who fled were permanent residents of the
53-acre ranch, located in this rural area about 50 east of downtown
Los Angeles; the other 150 were Labor Day visitors, she said.
   Rocco Lollo, whose age was not available, suffered burns over 50
percent of his body and was treated at a hospital, said fire
department spokeswoman Lesley Dale. An unidentified woman suffered
minor injuries, Ms. Dale said.
   The fire started in some brush and spread to three acres before
it was contained in about 1{ hours, fire officials said.
   Two homes were destroyed and three were damaged. Seven outside
structures were destroyed as were four vehicles. Damage was
estimated at $250,000, said Ms. Dale.
   The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but arson
was ruled out, she added. People were allowed to return to the camp
by 10 p.m.
   Repeated attempts to contact the camp by phone were
unsuccessful. A Pacific Bell operator said the phone appeared to
have been taken off the hook.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hussein Musavi submitted his resignation
after seven years as Iran's prime minister, but President Ali
Khamenei rejected it today, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   Musavi had tendered his resignation Monday, saying in a letter
to Khamenei that he wanted to step down primarily because he
believed as many as eight of his Cabinet's 21 members would fail to
win a vote of confidence in the Majlis, Iran's 270-seat parliament,
the agency said.
   It was not immediately clear whether Musavi would accept
Khamenei's action.
   Musavi had indicated in the letter printed today in Tehran's
Jomhuri Eslami newspaper that he would remain as a caretaker
premier until a successor was named, IRNA reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei's office as
saying the president turned down the premier's resignation in a
letter to Musavi.
   The Majlis had been scheduled to vote on Musavi's Cabinet today
but called off the session after the announced resignation, which
took foreign observers by surprise. Musavi, a 46-year-old radical,
has sought major economic reforms in the face of bitter opposition
from conservative clerics.
   In his letter, Musavi apparently did not explain why he believed
the Cabinet members would not win the confidence vote, but did say
his administration would not be able to function with eight vacant
Cabinet posts.
   He did not identify the Cabinet members, who have been at their
posts since Musavi carried out minor shuffles following two-stage
parliamentary elections in April and May. Musavi's appeared to have
strengthened his hand in the balloting, with radicals who seek
sweeping reforms making major gains.
   Musavi's Cabinet includes Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati,
who heads Iran's delegation to the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in
Geneva aimed at ending the 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ended years of playing off one
faction against the other earlier this year by openly supporting
the Musavi-led radicals and their campaign for economic reform.
   Amid persistent reports that Khomeini, 88, is ailing, a power
struggle between rival factions in Tehran to fill the vacuum when
the aging patriarch dies has intensified in recent months.
   Khomeini's unexpected decision last month to unconditionally
accept a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the gulf war, after a string
of military defeats, also sharpened divisions that have plagued
Tehran.
   The bearded Musavi, a militant fundamentalist who trained as an
engineer and architect at Tehran's Melli University, was named
prime minister in October 1981.
   Musavi has been criticized by conservative factions, who favor
private enterprise, for his handling of Iran's war-battered economy.
   He favors wider state control of the economy and a major
redistribution of land _ much of it still held by the merchants and
religious groups _ and the nation's wealth to help the poor.
   Before being named prime minister, Musavi had been foreign
minister and a member of the central council of the governing
Islamic Republic Party, which Khomeini disbanded last year. He was
one of the few laymen in the initial post-revolution period to take
high office in the theocratic Islamic Republic.
   Musavi began his revolutionary career as a clerk for Ayatollah
Mohammad Beheshti, secretary-general of the Islamic Republic Party
and one of the key revolutionary figures.
   Beheshti was killed with other senior political leaders in June
1981 when leftist opponents bombed the party headquarters.

<HEAD>Labor Party Kicks Off Election Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to MOVE up Peres vowing to return occupied
land in return for peace. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, ``The Palestinians
...''
^By DAN IZENBERG</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres kicked off
the Labor Party's election campaign by calling on Palestinians to
end their uprising and start a peace dialogue with Israel.
   Peres also vowed to return occupied territory in exchange for
peace, saying such a move would assure a stronger Israel with a
clear Jewish majority.
   ``We shall rid ourselves of Gaza, we shall rid ourselves of
areas densely populated by Arabs,'' Peres told a crowd of 3,000
supporters Monday night in a concert hall.
   Peres called on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip to end their 9-month-old rebellion and negotiate with Israel.
   ``We do not wish to oppress them, humiliate them or deport them.
The road is open before them, instead of fighting, there can be
dialogue,'' Peres said.
   ``The Palestinians will come (to negotiate) because a military
option does not exist for them and they still do not have a
political option of their own,'' Peres added and was wildly
applauded.
   The Palestinian revolt is the major campaign issue in the Nov. 1
elections, billed as the most crucial in Israel's 40-year history.
At least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the
unrest, which began Dec. 8.
   In its new platform, the left-leaning Labor Party calls for the
first time for direct talks with Palestinians and ``leaves the door
open for'' dialogue with the PLO, said Peres aide Yossi Beilin.
   Labor ``will be willing to hold a dialogue with Palestinian
people or agents who recognize Israel, oppose terror,'' and accept
two U.N. resolutions which implicitly recognize the Jewish state,
the platform says.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization is now banned in Israel as
a terrorist organization.
   Labor's platform supports relinqushing parts of the West Bank
and Gaza for peace. The territories are home to about 1.5 million
Palestinians and about 60,000 Jewish settlers.
   However, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin made it clear that
Israel would not yield all the land captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``Defensible borders cannot be the pre-1967 borders,'' Rabin
told the rally. ``We will not return to those lines, not even for
peace.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rival Likud Bloc objects to
relinquishing territory to the Arabs and to talks with the PLO. But
it favors a peace dialogue with other Palestinians on the basis of
the 1978 U.S.-brokered Camp David Accord, which preceded Israel's
1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
   The Camp David Agreement calls for five years of Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied territories as an interim solution.
   On July 31, King Hussein of Jordan announced he was cutting
administrative ties with the occupied lands and yielding
responsibility for their affairs to the PLO.
   Peres said he still believed a peace settlement with Jordan is
possible.
   ``We shall invite Jordan and we shall invite the Palestinians,''
to peace talks, he said. ``The Jordanians will come because when we
talk peace, Jordan will not turn away.''
   Speaker after speaker attacked the Likud, setting the stage for
what promises to be a vitriolic election campaign.
   ``We have 55 days (until election day) to confront the coalition
of annexationists, a right wing which has become more extreme,''
said Peres. ``It is a coalition based on fear, a coalition which
spreads fear of peace.''
   While party leaders raised their arms, clenched their fists and
promised victory, many spectators appeared doubtful.
   Recent public opinion polls indicate that the rightist parties
led by the Likud have a slight edge over the liberal coalition
headed by Labor.
   Likud and Labor have maintained a tenuous coalition since 1984
because neither party won a majority that year in the 120-seat
Knesset, Israel's parliament.

<HEAD>FBI Arrests Fugitive Wanted For Killing Boston Police Officer</HEAD>

   The FBI trailed one its 10 most wanted fugitives
from Boston to Mexico before arresting him there for the 1987
slaying of a policeman.
   Ted Jeffrey Otsuki, 36, was being extradited to Los Angeles late
Monday after a yearlong search that culminated in his arrest Sunday
in Guadalajara, Mexico, authorities said.
   ``Otsuki is a very very violent and dangerous fugitive,'' said
James F. Ahearn, special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston
bureau. ``I characterized him ... as one of the most dangerous I
had ever encountered.''
   Otsuki, a Harlingen, Texas, native, was on parole after serving
a prison sentence for robbing a Texas bank when he allegedly shot
detective Roy J. Sergei, 42, and rookie officer Jorge Torres in
Boston, said FBI Special Agent Neil Gallagher.
   On Oct. 2, 1987, the two Boston police officers had stopped a
suspect after they spotted him trying to climb a fence behind a
building
   While Otsuki was being taken into custody, police say, he
reached inside his pocket and fired a 9mm pistol through his coat,
striking Torres in the chest and left arm.
   The suspect fled through an alley where he was confronted by
Sergei and his partner. He fired again, striking Sergei in the
chest, buttocks and right arm.
   Boston police obtained a murder warrant for Otsuki after Sergei,
who was recovering from his wounds, died of a heart attack Oct. 26.
An autopsy concluded that Sergei's heart attack resulted from an
embolism directly related to his wounds.
   Torres, 21 at the time of the shooting, recovered from his
wounds.
   During the search, investigators traced Otsuki to San Francisco,
where police discovered two pipe bombs in a downtown storage area
that Otsuki was renting, authorities said. The bombs were
dismantled and no one was injured.
   Besides the police killing, Otsuki faces charges of unlawful
possession of explosives, felonious posession of a firearm,
interstate flight to avoid prosecution and parole violations, the
FBI said.

   Somewhere out there is a cab with a trunkful of
wedding presents that belong to a pair of newlyweds.
   Tom and Betsy McCormack were married Sunday night and celebrated
with about 100 friends and relatives.
   After the reception, they invited their closest relatives back
to their suite at the Barbizon Hotel across town to open the gifts.
   But Tom's brother, Dan, who was charged with transporting the
30-odd presents and dozens of checks, left them in the trunk of a
cab.
   ``This was not the way we wanted to cap off a beautiful
wedding,'' the 32-year-old groom, a lawyer, said Monday.
   ``Everyone's running around trying to figure out how to get the
presents back,'' said the bride, 29, a computer analyst.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Human Rights Improved In Cuba, But Critics Still Jailed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist leaders of Cuba continue to imprison
citizens who speak out against them, but have also taken
significant steps toward improving human rights, Amnesty
International says in a report today.
   Cuba's recent release of large numbers of political prisoners,
improvement of prison conditions and limiting of the scope of the
death penalty were welcomed by the international human rights
organization.
   However, laws that have been used to stifle opposition and jail
``prisoners of conscience'' remain in force and seriously threaten
government critics, it said.
   The report was written after a three-member team led by Amnesty
Secretary-General Ian Martin visited Cuba in March for the first
time since 1977.
   The group repeated its longstanding appeal to Cuba for the
unconditional release of prisoners of conscience, people jailed for
their political or religious beliefs. Many recently released
prisoners have been forced to leave Cuba, it said.
   Most political prisoners were charged with ``enemy propaganda''
after writing or saying things the government disapproved of,
sometimes in private letters sent abroad or to foreign embassies in
Havana, Amnesty said.
   It said others were convicted of trying to leave Cuba without
permission or of insulting behavior toward state officials.
   The group believes others were sentenced for politically related
criminal offenses ``where there is reason to believe that they may
have been convicted solely on account of their peaceful opposition
to the Cuban government,'' the report said.
   Amnesty urged the Havana government to speed up a promised
review of hundreds of political prisoners and expressed concern
about their ability to obtain a proper defense and trial.
   It said the ``steady pace'' of recent releases of political
prisoners made it difficult to estimate how many are still held in
Cuba.
   As of early August, about 250 prisoners were being held for
crimes against state security and an unknown number _ believed to
be in the hundreds _ were held under other sections of Cuba's penal
code used to restrict basic rights, particularly the
internationally recognized right to leave one's country, Amnesty
said.
   The Amnesty team met senior Cuban security and legal officials,
visited two prisons holding political prisoners and interviewed
dozens of prisoners in private, the report said.
   It said political inmates in the two prisons, Combinado del Este
and Boniato, were in the past reported to have been beaten, kept in
poor conditions, given inadequate food and denied medical treatment.
   It said Cuban authorities told the visitors they were trying to
improve the worst parts of these prisons. The report noted that
improvements in physical conditions and the prison regime appear to
have been introduced in the last eight months.
   However, Amnesty said prisoners do not feel confident of getting
a fair hearing about complaints and fear retaliation.
   Amnesty said use of the death penalty appears to have been
reduced considerably since the early 1980s.
   It quoted Cuba's justice minister as saying that although 216
people were executed between 1959 and 1987, the number executed
since 1984 is 11, all for common crimes rather than security crimes.

Arrested</HEAD>

   Residents near Golden Gate Park oppose
open-air soup kitchens near their homes, a neighborhood leader
said, after the arrest of 50 people who clashed with police while
trying to pass out food and pamphlets.
   No injuries were reported in Monday's fracas. On Aug. 29, 29
people were arrested in a similar confrontation, and leaders of the
group called Food Not Bombs said they would return each Monday.
   Lorraine Rorke, vice president of one of several neighborhood
organizations opposed to the giveaways by the group, said residents
believe it is ``not so interested in giving away food as they are
in promoting their particular message.''
   Food and fists flew Monday when police in riot gear closed in on
about 200 people gathered for the giveaway.
   The scene was next to Haight-Ashbury, home of the flower power
movement in the '60s, but more recently a transitional neighborhood
where restored Victorian homes fetch hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   Food Not Bombs members have a right to their political views,
Rorke said.
   ``I just don't like their means of using the hungry and blocking
the entrance to the park,'' she said.
   She added that it is difficult to reach a playground at the park
without passing through a crowd of ``left-over hippies and
burnt-out druggies.''
   Police spokesman Sgt. Jerry Senkir said the action would not
have been against the law had the group obtained permits.
   As the officers approached, food began to fly through the air,
with one officer being hit in the face with a plate of rice and one
being struck in the neck with a tomato.
   Those arrested faced possible misdemeanor charges, and one woman
faced a charge of assaulting an officer, Senkir said.
   Besides passing out food, Food Not Bombs distributed leaflets
saying the group had been harassed recently by police and had been
unfairly characterized by Mayor Art Agnos as being interested in
exploiting the homeless and hungry.

<TEXT>
   Wearing a yellow poncho in the steady rain,
10-year-old Margaret Nathaniel helped her mother stock their gray
tent with camping supplies: sleeping bags, thin mattresses and a
cooler.
   Outside the tent, beneath a cluster of sturdy oak trees, they
had a clear view of the 12-foot fence, topped with a spiral of
barbed wire, that surrounded them and the rest of the Dwight
Correctional Center, Illinois' only prison for women.
   But inside, at the start of an overnight campout for inmates and
their children, they could ignore the fence, be alone and, if only
for a few hours, do the things that mothers and daughters do.
   ``It gives me pleasure today to sleep with her, to comb her
hair, to wash her,'' said Margaret's mother, Cathy Nathaniel, a
convicted murderer.
   The campout on the last weekend of August was the last of three
held over the summer at Dwight, located some 75 miles southwest of
Chicago. About 80 children and 36 inmates took part in the program,
funded by a federal grant, said Warden Jane Huch.
   The children arrived on a Saturday morning, stayed overnight in
tents with their mothers and left the next day. Volleyball, crafts,
a play performed by the prison drama club and an evening bonfire
helped fill their time.
   The overnight visit gave Sheryl Decker, 37, a chance to have
some ``girl talk'' with her 17-year-old daughter, Debbie, but it
didn't completely ease the pain of separation.
   ``When we look at each other and I know she's got to go beyond
that fence, you know it hurts, and we know it for a minute but then
we shrug it off and we go on,'' Ms. Decker said. ``We kind of play
and get it up out of our system. But it's coming.''
   For Ms. Decker and Ms. Nathaniel, separation from their children
is the hardest part of imprisonment.
   ``That is the punishment, that's it,'' said Ms. Nathaniel, who
hopes to be paroled in 4{ years.
   But the visits help.
   Imprisonment means missing experiences that other mothers and
daughters share, said Ms. Decker, who hopes to be paroled in three
years from an 18-year term for armed violence.
   ``You go to sleep at night and you wake up and it's to the same
thing every day,'' she said. ``It's not like being with your child
and raising them and teaching them the facts of life, going through
their first dating experience ... finding her first love.''
   Ordinary visits can last from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on a weekday or
until 7 p.m. on weekends, but Ms. Decker said it's not enough.
   ``You really don't have time to really talk about the most
important parts of a daughter-and-mother relationship,'' she said.
   Ms. Decker has been in prison for six years, since her daughter
was 11. At first Debbie lived with foster parents, then at a
children's home. Now she lives alone in the central Illinois town
of Paris as she begins her senior year in high school.
   She cries as she describes life without her mother, whom she
calls her best friend.
   ``You know how you get up for school and your mom always tells
you you look nice or you go to prom and they're there,'' she says,
haltingly, adding that for her, ``they're not there.''
   Luz Ferro, 26, has been in Dwight on a drug-dealing conviction
for nearly half of her 4-year-old daughter's life.
   Ms. Ferro says her daughter, Karina, who is living with her
sister-in-law in Waukegan, is too young to fully understand why
they have to be separated.
   ``Today she saw this little tent. She said, ``Oh Mama, this is
wonderful,' and I said `Yes, honey, we're going to be sleeping here
tonight.'
   ``And she said, `What about tomorrow night?' and I said `No,
you've got to go back home.'
   ``She said, `Why Mommy, why do I have to go back? Why can't I
stay here and we can sleep in the tent?'''
   That's when Ms. Ferro tried to explain punishment and what it
means.
   ``I tell her ... they punished me because I did something wrong
and the punishment is I have to stay away from you,'' she said.
``That's the punishment.''

<HEAD>Poll: 80 Percent Satisfied With Public Education, But Prefer
Public Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMMAUS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 80 percent of parents are satisfied
with their children's public schools, but if they had the money,
more than half would send their children to private schools, a poll
shows.
   The survey, commissioned by Children magazine, shows that 41
percent of parents said they were very satisfied with their child's
public school, and another 40 percent said they were somewhat
satisfied.
   But if money were no object, 51 percent would choose to send
their child to a private or parochial school, according to the
survey.
   The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 6
percentage points, drew from a sample of 305 parents with children
in public schools.
   The poll is included in a report in the magazine's October
issue, ``Report Card on Public Education.''
   Jeff Meade, a senior editor of the magazine, writes that many
education experts play down the popular solutions to solving the
country's education problems, such as tougher graduation
requirements, more homework and teacher competency tests, in favor
of more parent involvement and more creative school management.
   The current education system is inadequate, Meade writes, and
that inadequacy goes beyond sagging grades in the basics.
   Absenteeism, violence, drug use and social isolation are now a
large part of the public school student's environment, Meade
writes. The typical high school student winds up cutting 10 classes
a year, and one out of four high school students drop out, he
writes.
   More and more students have both parents working outside the
home, Meade writes, but schools are not adapting to the shifting
family structure.
   For a community to battle these problems, Meade says the
atmosphere of its school has to improve: Parents have to become
more involved, ask more questions and take part in curriculum
planning, principals have to be more interested in education than
in management, and teachers should have more say in their own
educational programs.

Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The scheduled pullout of the missile
cruiser Vincennes from the Persian Gulf region has been postponed
because at least one Arab government objected to its departure,
U.S. military sources said.
   The 9,600-ton cruiser was to have ended its patrol duties with
the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle East on Sunday and was earlier
reported to have left.
   In reducing the force from 27 to 26 ships, the Vincennes would
have represented the first cutback by the United States since the
Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war.
   The military sources, insisting on anonymity, on Monday said the
Vincennes was remaining on station in the Arabian Sea, possibly for
another five days.
   The change of orders was based on diplomatic rather than
military considerations, and ``came from a much higher level than
the Navy in the gulf,'' said one source. That source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, also said the Pentagon decision not to
replace the cruiser still stood.
   U.S. military and diplomatic sources said they could not
identify the Arab state that raised objections to the Vincennes
leaving the region.
   The Vincennes, one of the Navy's powerful ``Aegis'' cruisers, is
winding up a tour that was marred by its mistaken downing of an
Iranian jetliner on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard.
   The Vincennes, which carries a crew of 385, left its home port
at San Diego in late April and entered the gulf on May 27,
conducting air surveillance in the Strait of Hormuz and southern
gulf.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in thin early European trading today. Gold prices were
mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they were waiting for American
markets to reopen and provide fresh direction. American financial
institutions were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.
   ``The market is likely to remain relatively dead until the U.S.
opens,'' said one trader in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 135.60. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 135.68 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8532 West German marks, down from 1.8555
   _1.5605 Swiss francs, down from 1.5625
   _6.3045 French francs, down from 6.3124
   _2.0939 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0957
   _1,382.75 Italian lire, up from 1,380.50
   _1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2338
   In London, the dollar fell more than 1 cent against the British
pound. One pound cost $1.6965 today compared with $1.6860 late
Monday.
   Gold prices were steady in sluggish London trading today.
Bullion dealers said there was little incentive to push the
precious metal one way or the other.
   Gold opened in London at a bid $426.80 a troy ounce, down from
$427.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $427.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $427.70, up slightly from $427.50
bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 23 cents to close at a bid
$429.15.
   Silver was unchanged at $6.50 a troy ounce in London.

<TEXT>
   Flood waters receded today in some of
the hardest hit parts of Bangladesh, but the country still faces
massive problems in getting food, medicine and safe drinking water
to millions of marooned people.
   ``We will have to feed the people for two months at least,''
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said after a helicopter flight
over villages and rice paddies swamped by flood waters that cover
three-fourths of this impoverished nation of 110 million people.
   The floods that started in June, then eased only to surge again
last week, have killed at least 406 people by government count. But
this figure is generally regarded as understated, and daily tallies
reported by Dhaka newspapers put the death toll at 1,122.
   The Health Ministry says more than 100,000 people are known to
be suffering from diarrhea and 5,715 more from dysentery as a
result of drinking contaminated water.
   In Rajbari, a town of 50,000 people 45 miles west of Dhaka,
people stood in chest-deep water as a motorboat carried Ershad past
their flooded houses.
   He disembarked at a relief camp set up in a government school
and handed out new, bright pink 50-taka notes (worth about 1.55
cents) to people crowding around him. He plunged into the flood
water that surged past his knees as small boys splashed and paddled
in the muddy brown swirl around him.
   About 800,000 people live in the Rajbari district, which
includes hundreds of outlying villages. Munshi Abdul Latif, a
member of Parliament from the district, estimated at least 500,000
were temporarily displaced by the flood and had sought refuge on
higher ground.
   He said at least 15,000 houses were destroyed.
   The biggest problem at the moment, Abdul Latif said, was a
virtual absence of fuel that has left people without any means of
cooking rice or any other food they had managed to save from the
flood.
   The government has used boats and helicopters to ferry food,
mainly rice, to people stranded on bits of high ground. But with
only a dozen helicopters in service, the task is proceeding slowly.
   Wing commander Firdaus, a helicopter pilot who uses only one
name, said he had made 30 relief flights in the last three days.
``In some villages we can't even land,'' he said. ``We just have to
drop the food.''
   The flood control center said 12 major rivers were still rising
today, but three of the mightiest rivers _ the Ganges, Brahmaputra
and Meghna _ have started receding.
   This could be seen clearly in today's helicopter flight over
four administrative districts west of the capital.
   Bright green rice plants poked above the flood level in neatly
defined rectangular fields. During a helicopter flight over the
same area 24 hours earlier, the paddies were completely submerged.
   Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told reporters Monday that
50 of the country's 64 districts have been ``directly affected'' by
floods and 21 million people rendered homeless.
   He said 25 million people had lost relatives, a home or
business, crops or other property.
   The diarrhea cases primarily have hit the interior but were also
reported today in Dhaka, a city of 6 million. Rahmat Ali, a
municipal official, said flood waters had entere the city's
drinking supply through leaky pipes.
   Floods are an annual monsoon event in Bangladesh, a disaster
that accompanies the blessing of rain for the crops, but Rahman and
other officials said those of 1988 are the worst in memory.
   Last year's floods killed about 300 people, Rahman said, but
Dhaka newspapers put the 1987 toll at 1,500.
   Bangladesh, whose per capita annual income of $150, is one of
the world's poorest nations. Rivers run through it like veins,
making it a sort of giant drain pipe for flood waters that pour
south into the Bay of Bengal.

   Police in several cities arrested demonstrators in
wheelchairs who blocked crowded Greyhound terminals in a protest in
which they charged the buses are inaccessible to disabled riders.
   Participants in some of the demonstrations, organized by
American Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation, or ADAPT,
blocked travelers' entry to buses Monday, police said.
   Five protesters in wheelchairs and one blind demonstrator were
arrested in Dallas and taken to jail, said police Sgt. K. Walters.
   Arrests also occurred in Louisville, Ky., and Denver, and an
organizer said the protests occurred in several other cities.
   ``This is a very busy day for us,'' said George Gravley, a
spokesman for Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc. ``It's a holiday
weekend. People are going home and thousands of people are being
inconvenienced because buses are being delayed.''
   Leaders of the Denver-based civil rights group said the arrests
would focus on the plight of low-income disabled people who cannot
afford cars. ADAPT wants Greyhound to install lifts on buses for
those in wheelchairs.
   ``We're asking them to sign an agreement that any new bus built
will be accessible,'' said the Rev. Wade Blank, an ADAPT spokesman
in Denver.
   Greyhound officials met leaders of ADAPT in August and will do
so again this month, Gravley said.
   ``We went through all of this in Denver,'' he said. ``We thought
we responded in a forthright way to issues they raised. We are
disappointed obviously that the demonstrations continued.''
   In Denver, 10 people, including eight in wheelchairs, were cited
for disturbing the peace.
   In Louisville, Ky., a protest involving 25 people resulted in
the arrests of eight demonstrators, six in wheelchairs.
   Protests also were scheduled Monday in Atlanta, Salt Lake City,
Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles and Savannah, Ga., Blank
said, with one in Chicago set for today.
   Gravley said a Greyhound subsidiary has applied for a grant to
use toward designing an exprimental bus that would be accessible to
the disabled. The company has proposed creation of an advisory
group comprised of some ADAPT members, he said.
   Greyhound operates Helping Hands, a program that provides a free
ticket for disabled people who are unable to travel by themselves.

   A 22-year-old Navy recruit was being held
without bail today for the shotgun killing of his older brother in
what one policeman called ``a Cain and Abel type'' case.
   Michael Schmid pleaded innocent to second-degree murder at his
arraignment before Judge W. Bromley Hall in Hauppauge on Monday.
   Suffolk County police said Schmid, who had recently finished
boot camp at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station near Chicago,
was staying in a friend's apartment in Smithtown on Long Island
when the shooting occurred Sunday.
   According to Detective Gene McCready of the homicide squad, when
Schmid's family offered to get him a lawyer, Schmid said in court:
``Don't bother. I did it! I did it! I planned it!''
   The judge warned him that if he wasn't quiet he would
incriminate himself.
   Sgt. Robert Doyle, of the homicide squad, described Schmid's
relationship with his family as ``strained.''
   Schmid invited over his 24-year-old brother, John, who lived
with their parents and sister in Hauppauge, and put on his Navy
uniform to show him, said police spokesman David Bloom.
   Michael Schmid came out of a bedroom in uniform, carrying an
AR-15 rifle which he handed to his brother to inspect, according to
Bloom. After John Schmid returned it, Michael Schmid went back into
the bedroom and emerged a second time, this time holding a
12-gauge, pump-action shotgun that discharged as he thrust it
toward his brother, Bloom said.
   John Schmid, an electrical engineer who worked for his father,
was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead about an hour
after the shooting.
   ``It was a real tragedy,'' said Doyle, ``a Cain and Abel type
thing.''

   A plane carrying softball players home from
a weekend tournament crashed shortly after takeoff, killing one
person and injuring nine others, officials said.
   The plane appeared to have made a forced landing Monday in a
small icefield near Indigo Lake, about five miles southeast of
Sitka, police Officer Dan Bierman said.
   Bierman identified the dead man as Steven K. Oneil, 35. Two
others were seriously injured.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately determined, and
Federal Aviation Administration officials were to investigate the
crash site today, Bierman said.
   Rainy weather may have been a factor, he said.

<TEXT>
   Eyeglasses with blue and yellow lenses sold for
$5,400 today as a four-day auction began of rock star Elton John's
belongings _ from diamante-soled platform boots to Rembrandt
etchings.
   Sotheby's auction house predicted the 1,922 lots would bring in
more than $3 milion pounds ($5 million). The sale catalogue alone
costs 40 pounds ($67) and already is a collector's item.
   John, 41, singer, pianist and composer, is selling everything in
the collection he put together over 20 years and kept at Woodside,
his mansion near Windsor, west of London.
   Today, eyeglasses with blue and yellow lenses sold for 3,200
pounds ($5,400). The buyer of the eyeglasses, like all the early
purchasers, remained anonymous.
   Mitch and Michele Phillips, of Cleveland, Ohio, flew to London
to bid for memorabilia.
   ``I have been an Elton John fan for 15 years and keep trying to
meet him, but with no luck yet,'' said Mitch Phillips, wearing a
straw boater hat and glitzy, Elton John-style eyeglasses.
   Hundreds of telephone calls from overseas bidders sent prices
well above catalogue listings, Sotheby's said today.
   Four personalized car license plates went for 2,400 pounds
(4,056 dollars), instead of the 250 pounds (422 dollars) listed in
the catalogue.
   Three signed photographs of the Apollo 15 astronauts dedicated
to the ``Rocket Man,'' one of John's biggest hit songs, sold for
2,100 pounds ($3,549), far higher than the expected 180 pounds
($304). A Wurlitzer jukebox expected to bring 7,000 pounds
($11,830) went for 16,000 pounds ($27,040).
   Also for sale are John's stage costumes, Rembrandt etchings,
Tiffany lamps, zany hats, beer advertisements, tartan bagpipes,
soft toy gorillas, art deco vases and statuettes, walking sticks,
pottery mugs of Queen Elizabeth II, furniture and jewelry.
   John, a millionaire many times over, rarely gives interviews but
prepared a videotape to explain why he is selling his collection.
   ``People will say I need the money, which is ridiculous,'' he
said on the video. ``I just bought things that I liked whether they
were cheap or expensive.''
   ``I would rather people bought them and got pleasure from them
than leave them sitting in cases ... I am not too old to rock 'n'
roll but I am too old to wear this lot again.''
   Marcus Linell, Sotheby's senior director in charge of the
auction, said in an interview: ``He has no more room in his home
and he wants to move and have a complete change. He will start
collecting other things which are a novelty.''
   Asked where John acquired the skill to collect many things which
are now in demand, like art deco jewelry, Linell said: ``He's avant
garde and he's got great enthusiasm ... Just as in his music, he's
on the cutting edge of taste and fashion all the time.''
   ``I found him a hyperactive, intelligent, amusing man who came
over terribly nicely as a person,'' Linell said.
   The sale is Sotheby's most ambitious international production
since it sold the late Andy Warhol's collection in New York in
April for $25 million.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Workers Resign From Party En Masse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All 187 Foreign Ministry workers who
belonged to Burma's ruling party resigned from the party and
employees of 16 diplomatic missions have expressed support for the
formation of an interim government, ministry sources said today.
   A statement from ministry employees said the workers decided
Monday to resign from the Burma Socialist Program Party, which
protesters blame for 26 years of repression and ruinous economic
policies.
   Ministry sources said that with the exception of the
ambassadors, employees at 16 of the 26 foreign missions have
supported demands for formation of an interim government to lead
Burma to democracy.
   The statement appealed for support from foreign missions: ``We
have now reached a stage where the government should comply
forthwith with the people's wishes. Any responsible government
would have done so long ago.
   ``Procrastination in any form by the government, either by
resorting to irrelevant legal procedures or by various maneuvers,
tactics, (and) ruses designed to retain the reins of power would
inevitably bring about immense suffering to the people, together
with the ultimate threat of ... strife.''
   ``We must prevent such an outcome at all costs so those
schoolchildren, students and martyrs who have valiantly given up
their lives in this historic struggle would not have died in
vain,'' it said.
   Many government departments have stated opposition to the
government; some have held street demonstrations. This has crippled
President Maung Maung's administration, which faces the threat of
nationwide demonstrations Thursday unless it yields to demands for
an interim government.
   Lawlessness spread to the capital today as looters stripped
three government warehouses. Authorities made no attempt to
intervene.
   Sources said hundreds of people carried away bags of rice from a
warehouse in western Rangoon. In brisk business near the warehouse,
they sold the rice to merchants for 100 kyats, or 17 cents per
165-pound bag _ a quarter of the normal price.
   Nearby, looters took frozen fish, trays and equipment from a
Fisheries Department warehouse and another group stole provisions
and office equipment from a Food and Beverages Corp. warehouse near
Rangoon University.
   Residents of the Rangoon suburb of South Okkalapa earlier
reported at least 20 people died in a clash at a biscuit factory
between looters and members of a neighborhood committee.
   The government says the party leadership will meet Monday to
consider organizing a referendum on one-party rule. Some diplomats
speculate the chaos is being orchestrated to create an excuse for
the party to re-establish itself or for military intervention.
   On Monday, opposition leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and former
Defense Minister Tin Oo threw their support to a demand by one
student group that an interim government be formed by Wednesday
night or protests will follow Thursday.
   Burma's turmoil mounted after students rioted last September to
protest economic policies and then led broader-based street
protests in March and June.
   Street riots flared anew after Ne Win resigned July 23 following
26 years in power and the party chose Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Government radio said at least 112 people died in Rangoon in
rioting against Sein Lwin, who resigned after 17 days in power.
   Demonstrations have been largely peaceful since Maung Maung took
office Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader in 26 years.

<HEAD>Seattle Blackout Ended, Utility Crews Turn to Preventing
Recurrence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With power restored in a 50-block downtown area
after a four-day blackout, crews are checking for wiring similar to
the kind that contributed to the city-owned utility's worst outage.
   The precise cause of the fire that resulted in the outage
Wednesday remained undetermined. Power to all but one building in
the city's retail, financial and hotel core was restored by Sunday
evening.
   Seattle City Light officials attributed the severity of the
blackout to the melting of an aluminum, direct-current supply cable
for overhead electrical trolley bus lines in an underground vault
that also contained six of the utility's 13,000-volt feeder cables.
   During the height of the blackout, officials estimated that 90
percent of all businesses were closed in the area, which included
an estimated 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place
Market, the Bon Marche department store, the 875-room Westin Hotel
and uncounted other hotels, food stores and taverns.
   City Light officials said they had no estimate of the utility's
losses and the costs of restoring power. There was no cost estimate
available for losses sustained by the utility's customers.
   Scott Forslund, a utility spokesman, said it might be several
days before power is restored to the last building without service,
a parking garage near the vault, because its low-voltage supply
lines were destroyed in the same fire that wrecked the feeder
cables.
   The fire began in low-voltage utility lines between transformers
in the vault and individual buildings, said City Light assistant
superintendent Jerry Garman.
   As the system heated, power to the high-voltage feeder cables
should have been cut by ``current limiters,'' but the transit cable
melted, and its molten aluminum cut the high-voltage cables before
power could be shut off to all but two of them.
   ``When aluminum melts, it's just like adding gasoline'' to a
fire, City Light spokesman Hugh McIntosh said.
   ``It took what would have been a minor inconvenience and turned
it into a major event,'' Garman said. ``It's like we had eight or
nine welding torches going at the same time.''
   City Light crews will check other locations with similar
combinations of utility and Metro cables to try to prevent a
similar outage, Garman said.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who has
admitted taking part in the 1985 TWA hijacking in which a U.S. Navy
diver was killed, testified today that he rejects ``all forms of
violence.''
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in connection with
the hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days
and diver Robert Stethem was shot and killed after TWA Flight 847
was seized on a flight from Athens to Rome and diverted to Beirut.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, says he was among the
hijackers, but insists he did not kill Stethem and that he tried to
dissuade an accomplice from shooting the 23-year-old sailor.
   Today, Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger asked Hamadi whether he
renounced violence.
   Hamadi replied:
   ``Yes. Before the hijacking I thought such methods were right.
But now I realize you can fight for your homeland without using
weapons. I reject all kinds of violence.''
   U.S. officials have indicted four people in the hijacking,
including Hamadi. The other three suspects remain at large. West
Germany rejected a U.S. extradition request for Hamadi after two
West Germans were taken captive in Beirut by kidnappers seeking
Hamadi's release.
   Hamadi has testified that the hijackers' goal was to force the
release of Lebanese Shiites imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after
hijacking, Israel freed about 700 Lebanese.
   The defendant repeated that he did not kill Stethem.
   ``I already said the other (one of his accomplices) was
responsible and he was the murderer,'' Hamadi said.
   ``Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane,
to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,'' he
said. He refused to say who issued the orders.
   Mueckenberger asked Hamadi where he got the weapons used in the
hijacking.
   ``On the plane itself,'' Hamadi replied. He refused to say how
the weapons got there.
   Hamadi said the hijackers had two hand grenades and a pistol.
   Under West German law, the Frankfurt court can convict Hamadi of
murder even if he did not pull the trigger. Hamadi, who West German
officials say is 24 years old, faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said the court had set aside
Wednesday and Friday for testimony from two U.S. citizens. He
declined to identify the witnesses.
   Flight 847 pilot John Testrake and other members of the plane's
crew are scheduled to start testifying Sept. 12.
   Hamadi was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at Frankfurt airport when
customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage. His trial began
July 5 in a courtroom inside Preungesheim prison.
   In April, a Duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers,
Abbas Hamadi, to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two German
businessmen in Beirut in an unsuccessful bid to force West Germany
to free Mohammed. One of the West Germans was freed but the other
remains a hostage.

   Japan today conducted a 62-second test launch of a
rocket that is expected to pave the way for lifting larger payloads
into space, the National Space Development Agency said.
   The 47-foot TR-1 rocket was launched at 8 a.m. from the
Tanegashima Space Center on Tanegashima island in southern Japan,
said agency spokesman Yoshinari Ueda. The rocket dropped into the
sea more than a minute after it was launched. He said the two solid
rocket boosters attached to the rocket's main body were separated
47.7 seconds after the liftoff.
   A part of the rocket that collected flight and technical data
was recovered by a boat about 60 miles south of Tanegashima, Ueda
said.
   The TR-1 test rocket was jointly developed by Nissan Motor
Corp., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and NEC Corp. and cost $5.3
million to manufacture and launch, according to Ueda.
   Japan's next generation of rockets, the H-2, will be able to
carry a 2-ton payload and is to be launched in 1991, Ueda said.
Japanese companies now limit rocket payloads to 1,200 pounds.
   Today's experimental launch is one of three Japan plans to
conduct before 1991 to gather further data for the development of
the H-2 rocket, Ueda said.

<HEAD>Agency Deleted Criticisms From Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control deleted
all criticisms of its efforts to fight AIDS among minorities before
making public its report on the subject, The Atlanta Constitution
reported today.
   CDC Director James O. Mason acknowledged that parts of the
analysis were condensed from 16 pages to two pages after they were
reviewed by CDC officials, but the newspaper quoted him as refusing
to say why the agency deleted critical sections of the report. The
newspaper cited government records as its source but did not
elaborate.
   Mason said the CDC has not yet developed an overall strategy to
fight AIDS among blacks and Hispanics, who account for more than 40
percent of the victims of the disease.
   ``If we were to craft a specific, forward-looking game plan, we
would involve them in crafting it,'' he said.
   The CDC paid a private consultant $12,000 for an analysis of its
efforts to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome among blacks
and Hispanics.
   Among other things, the consultant's report said CDC had no
``cohesive plan of action'' to prevent AIDS among minorities and is
unaware of how much of the money given to local health departments
for minority AIDS programs actually reached minority populations.
   The report also said the agency does not have information about
the ``knowledge, attitudes and behaviors'' of minority populations.
   Mason said the consultant's study was not intended to be used by
the CDC to provide an overall picture of its efforts to prevent and
control AIDS among minorities. He said it was designed to provide
him with information to present at a conference of minority health
workers and to summarize CDC grants to minority AIDS programs.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has said the only way to control
AIDS is by educating high-risk segments of the population. The CDC
estimates that among blacks and Hispanics there are 200,000
infected homosexual and bisexual men, 200,000 infected heterosexual
drug users, 100,000 infected women and 15,000 infected children and
infants.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deputy has been assigned to provide security
for the family of Martin Luther King Jr. for the past five months,
a measure defended by the county sheriff as a valid use of tax
money.
   ``I'd say it's public money going to protect a public family,''
Fulton County Sheriff Richard Lankford was quoted as saying in
today's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. ``Anything that
happened to the King family at this juncture would become
international.''
   King was assassinated April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. His
mother, Alberta King, was shot to death in 1975 while playing the
organ for a Sunday service in an Atlanta church.
   ``It would be an indictment, I think, against our community if
another tragedy would befall the family,'' the sheriff said in
acknowledging he assigned deputy Angelo Willoughby to the post.
   The newspaper said it learned of the deputy's hiring through
county records.
   County Manager Sam Brownlee said the county commission should
have been asked to approve the assignment because it amounts to
publicly financed protection for a private family.
   ``That is not something the Board of Commissioners has
authorized,'' he said. ``That's something the sheriff has done.''
   Willoughby reports daily to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Non-violent Social Change.
   ``I don't know if I would say he's a bodyguard, but he's there
for the protection of the family as well as for the security of the
center itself,'' Lankford said.
   The civil rights leader's son, Fulton County Commissioner Martin
Luther King III, said he appreciates the officer's presence.
   ``I carry the name Martin Luther King and that draws
crackpots,'' he said.
   ``A guy came up and approached my mother (Coretta Scott King)
last week,'' King said. ``He was just crazy. If he (Willoughby) had
not been there, something might have happened. Once he saw a police
official there, he backed off.''

   A man who escaped from prison less than
a week after he began serving his sentence was found hiding inside
a trash bin at a condominium in this posh seaside resort.
   Charles Edward Palamara, who escaped Sunday from Lantana
Correctional Institution, surrendered Monday when at least 10
officers surrounded his hiding place, said Lantana police Sgt. Jim
Laseur.
   ``He wasn't armed, and we were,'' said Palm Beach Lt. Joe Dietz.
``It was no problem.''
   A witness had reported seeing a man hiding in the trash bin.
   Palamara, 20, escaped by jumping the 12-foot-fence at the
prison, where officials said he had begun serving a 14-month
sentence for residential burglary and grand theft Thursday.
   Corrections officials said the escape could extend his sentence
to 15 years.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Syrian daily said today that
Iranian-backed opponents of the Iraqi government shot and wounded a
son of President Saddam Hussein.
   The Ash-Sharq newspaper said the claim was made in a statement
by the ``military wing of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.''
   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
   The statement reportedly said Udai Hussein, 24, was shot three
times in the chest as he drove from the northern town of Mosul to
the capital of Baghdad last week. It did not elaborate.
   The alleged attackers are affiliated with the Tehran-based
Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq, an umbrella
group for Shiite Moslem factions outlawed by Hussein's regime.
   Shiites comprise about half of Iraq's 15 million people. The
Iraqi authorities deported thousands of Shiites of Iranian descent
after the Persian Gulf war between the two countries began in 1980.
   The deportees settled in Iran and established various groups
that vowed to topple Hussein's regime and set up an Islamic state
in Iraq.

   A 21-year-old woman drowned while diving
in a water-filled cave when her air tanks ran out after she
panicked and swam in the wrong direction, ignoring arrows that
pointed the way out, police said.
   The woman was found Monday in a dead-end corridor in the cave at
Orange Grove Sink, about 70 feet down and 2,500 feet from the
cave's entrance.
   ``There obviously was some poor judgment and panic,'' said Woody
Jasper, a member of the team that recovered the body.
   The woman and her partner, who survived after finding his way
out of the cave, had finished a cave-diving course Sunday in the
cave that is marked with arrows pointing to the entrance.
   Deputies said the two had been following a line that marks a
course but lost sight of it when they had trouble with one of their
flashlights. By the time they got the light back on, they had
drifted away from the line, and she apparently panicked and swam
away. Her partner lost her.
   Both divers were trained but had made few dives since finishing
their training course, Jasper said.

   A fire near an aquatic park offering
``five million gallons and tons of fun'' destroyed eight cars and
burned about 10 acres of brush before it was extinguished,
authorities said.
   The fire ignited brush in a section of Los Angeles County's
Bonnelli Park, said county fire Capt. Garry Oversby. It was not
immediately known whether Monday's blaze began in a vehicle or in
the vegetation, he said, but the flames leaped from car to car. No
one was injured.
   ``Raging Waters is 44 acres, five million gallons and tons of
fun for everyone,'' a tape-recorded message at the park, about 25
miles northeast of Los Angeles, proclaimed.
   Unfortunately, the aquatic park's currents couldn't be tapped to
douse the blaze, which broke out less than a mile away in an area
used to handle overflow parking, fire officials said.
   Firefighters had trouble because there were no hydrants in the
parking lot, said County fire Inspector John Lenihan. Water was
rerouted from hydrants outside the lot and the blaze was
extinguished 2{ hours after it was reported. Damage was estimated
at $50,000, he said.
   The park, crowded because of the Labor Day holiday, was not
evacuated, said Kent Lemasters, Raging Waters vice president and
general manager.

in the northern port of Tripoli, police reported today.
   Officials said the victims suffered sharp stomach pains late
Monday after they ate meat sandwiches at a restaurant on Tripoli's

   The restaurant owner, who was not identified, was arrested and
police are investigating to determine the cause of the poisoning,
said a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   A blinding explosion split a Greek oil
tanker in two in this port near Athens today, killing at least
seven people, authorities said. Seventeen others were injured, many
of them with severe burns.
   Harbormaster Manolis Peloponessios said two bodies had been
recovered and at least two workers were missing from the 10:15 a.m.
blast that shattered the 86,000-ton Anangel Greatness in this
industrial port 10 miles west of the capital.
   ``We fear they (the two missing workers) may be trapped in one
of the tanks that's now below water,'' Peloponessios said.
   Harbor authorities say there was no suspicion of terrorism.
Instead, authorities say the blast was believed caused by gas fumes
left in the vessel's empty oil tanks.
   Investigators speculate welders working on the ship during
routine maintenance and cleaning may have sparked the blast.
   Last July 11, Arab terrorists launched a grenade and machine gun
attack that killed nine people and injured 98 others aboard the
City of Poros ship as it was returning to Athens from a Greek
island cruise.
   The skipper of the Anangel Greatness, Capt. Anastasios
Theocharis, said the ship had been certified free of gas before it
sailed into Perama on Monday. Merchant Marine Ministry officials
said the ship carried documents showing all gas had been removed.
   A Perama police officer who requested anonymity said portions of
what appeared to be five other bodies had been found but not yet
identified. He said the blast ``produced a blinding light in the
sky.''
   Officials said the explosion in the vessel's No. 3 fuel tank
tore apart the ship as about 25 workers were on board for cleaning
and maintenance work. Its 28-member crew also was aboard.
   ``I was in the control room at the stern when I heard a
tremendous noise and everything clattered to the deck,'' Theocharis
said.
   ``People were tossed all over the place. There were body
fragments landing on the deck of another tanker berthed next to
this one,'' said Costas Sakaros, a metalworkers' union official.
   Sakaros said crew members on the deck of the adjacent tanker,
the 300,000-ton Norwegian flag Ingres, were blown into the air by
the force of the blast.
   The green-and-white vessel started sinking but settled in
shallow water, covered in oily scum. Five hours after the blast,
black fumes still hung over the waterfront. The explosion also
shattered windows in stores and offices around Perama.

   HASTINGS, Neb. (AP)- President Reagan, heading back to the White
House after a three-week California vacation, today saluted a
privately supported communications school in a college that runs on
a balanced budget as ``a model for our society to follow.''
   Dedicating the C.J. and Marie Gray Communications Arts Center at
Hastings College, Reagan said the school's students will be
entering a profession that ``at times does not seem to appreciate
the simpler virtues.''
   In a speech at the dedication of the communications facility,
Reagan said, ``I'm told that Hastings College operates on a
balanced budget.''
   ``And the Gray Center itself has raised all its funds in the
private sector, not looking toward the government for a special leg
up or a free lunch,'' he said. ``That kind of self-reliance is
inspiring and a model for our society to follow.''
   ``It's a philosophy I hope the students who come here to learn
will carry with them when they leave to ply their skills elsewhere
in a profession that at times does not seem to appreciate the
simpler virtues,'' the president said.
   The center was built with the help of a $1 million grant from
former Reagan campaign official Bob Gray. A Hastings native, Gray
is a Washington public relations executive who was director of
communications for Reagan's 1980 campaign for the White House.
   The center is named for Gray's parents, Marie Gray and the late
Garold C.J. Gray. The elder Gray was an electrical engineer and his
wife was a house mother at the college.
   Reagan was also attending a closed fund-raising reception for
Nebraska's appointed Republican Sen. David Karnes at Grand Island,
Neb. Karnes is seeking election against Bob Kerrey, the state's
popular former Democratic governor.
   Later in the day, the president was speaking to about 7,500
delegates at an American Legion convention in Louisville, Ky., on
his way back to Washington for the first time since George Bush was
nominated to succeed him.
   Bush and his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, will speak to the legionnaires later in the week.
   In the coming weeks, Reagan faces a new round of negotiation
with Congress on the thorny issue of aid to Nicaraguan rebels and a
busy round of campaigning for Bush and other Republican candidates.
   On Wednesday, his first day back at work, the president has
scheduled a meeting with Republican congressional leaders.
   While the agenda has not been announced, the legislative
calendar includes aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, a landmark
free trade agreement with Canada, 11 appropriations bills, welfare
legislation, and confirmation of Reagan's nominations of Nicholas
Brady as secretary of the treasury and Lauro Cavazos as secretary
of education. Also hanging are backlogs of judicial and diplomatic
nominations Reagan hopes to see confirmed before he leaves office
4{ months from now.
   ``Contra aid is certainly one of the issues we have to deal with
right off the bat,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The Senate has passed a bill which the administration termed
minimally acceptable and the House, the biggest hurdle for Contra
aid in the past, has not acted.
   When asked whether the administration wanted to change the bill
to include military as well as humanitarian aid, Fitzwater declined
to answer, saying, ``It's to be a negotiated process.''
   Another administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said, ``The only way to get the right kind of Contra
aid is to let Congress do it. The more we come out for things,
sometimes the more it doesn't help the process.''
   In addition to his legislative battles, the president is
expected to make about two political trips a week until the
election, appearing on behalf of Senate and House candidates, but
also pushing for the election of his vice president to succeed him.
   Reagan left Washington on August 14 to speak at the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans. He flew to California on August
16 and has spent the time since at his 688-acre ranch north of here
and in Los Angeles.
   Since taking office in 1981, the president has spent 335 days at
the ranch. He is expected to return for a few days around
Thanksgiving.
   Officials say Reagan may go to the United Nations at the end of
September, as he usually does, but Fitzwater said no foreign travel
is planned before his term ends on Jan. 20.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers Amnesty for Kurdish Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command
Council today announced a ``general and comprehensive'' amnesty for
Kurdish rebels in an apparent effort to counter allegations its
forces are using poison gas against the tribesmen.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported
the council said the rebels, whether in Iraq or abroad, had 30 days
to turn themselves in to be pardoned but would then be allowed to
leave the country.
   Those ``who have obligations abroad, such as jobs or attending
school, would be allowed to leave,'' the news agency quoted the
announcement as saying. ``Their exit is guaranteed.''
   Baghdad's move came as Kurdish guerrillas reported fierce
fighting in northeast Iraq where they said 60,000 troops, with
tanks, fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships, were advancing into
the rebel strongholds.
   The rebels are seeking autonomy in their mountainous region,
where about 20 million Kurds live in the area where Syria, Iraq,
Iran and Turkey converge.
   The decree, addressed to ``the glorious Iraqi nation,'' singled
out the Kurds but contained no reference to the Kurds' demand for
an autonomous homeland.
   Iraq's estimated 3.5 million Kurds, about one-fifth of the
country's population, have been fighting on and off for 50 years
for independence.
   However, the Iraqi news agency said the amnesty did not extend
to ``the traitor,'' Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan, and Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic
Party.
   Talabani and Barzani joined forces with Iran during the Persian
Gulf war against Iraq. Their organizations have long been outlawed
by Iraq.
   Spokesmen for the two Kurdish parties claim the Iraqis have
repeatedly used outlawed chemical weapons against undefended
villages in recent days, killing at least 1,900 civilians and
wounding 5,000.
   Iraq has dnied using chemical weapons against the Kurds,
although it has admitted using them against Iranian forces during
the eight-year gulf war before fighting stopped when a United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   The Iraqi decree said all Kurdish prisoners would be pardoned
and ``released immediately ... except those convicted or wanted on
other charges.'' The Revolutionary Command Council statement said
the amnesty was based on the Islamic principle of pardoning
wrongdoers and ``giving them a chance to repent, even the most
devious and cursed.''
   Officials in Turkey say about 90,000 Kurds have fled across the
mountainous border since the Iraqi offensive began last last month.
   But Turkey's foreign minister, Mesut Yilmaz, said Monday that
the heavy influx of Kurds fleeing from Iraq has ceased because
Iraqi troops who had been battling the Kurds are blocking mountain
passes to Turkey.
   In Geneva, Iran has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees to provide aid for several thousand Kurdish refugees
fleeing the army offensive in Iraq, a U.N. refugee official said
today.
   Iran says 2,000 Iraqi Kurds streamed across the border into West
Azerbaijan province in recent days, and another 600 families are
heading toward the region, said the U.N. spokeswoman, Judith Kumin.

<HEAD>Dubcek To Go Abroad For First Time Since Prague Spring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Communist Party chief
Alxander Dubcek, who led the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement of
1968, is to travel abroad for the first time in 18 years to visit
Italy, a government spokesman said today.
   He said Dubcek was issued a visa to go to Italy, where the
University of Bologna is to award him an honorary degree in
political science on Nov. 12 for ``his role in defending democratic
principles and personal liberties.''
   Dubcek, 66, a retired forestry worker, was ousted after the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia and was expelled from the
Communist Party in 1970. He has not traveled abroad since then.
   Government spokesman Dusan Rovensky told The Associated Press
that Dubcek applied for a visa for himself and his wife Maria on
July 25 and the permit was issued three weeks later.
   When he did not pick up the documents, Dubcek was asked to do so
in a written Aug. 25 message from the authorities, Rovensky said.
He said Dubcek's wife came to pick up the travel papers Monday. The
Dubceks live in Bratislava, capital of the eastern region of
Slovakia.
   The party's monthly Novy Mysl said last month that the former
Communist leader and his followers were responsible for the
``crisis'' of August 1968, when the country was ``on the brink of
civil war.''
   On Aug. 20-21, 1968, Soviet and Warsaw Pact tanks moved into
Czechoslovakia to crush the liberal reforms introduced by Dubcek in
what is known as the ``Prague Spring.''
   Dubcek has in recent months given interviews to Western news
media in which he called for his own rehabilitation and for the
implementation in Czechoslovakia of reforms similar to those
supported by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   The $54 million mystery continued today
despite a report by a school janitor who says he holds the ticket
that won Florida's world-record Lotto jackpot.
   ``We have not received a claim from anyone,'' Leonard Schulte,
director of communications at the Lottery Department, said this
morning.
   Lottery officials know the ticket with the correct series of six
numbers was sold in this central Florida community.
   But 280 miles away, Liberty County Sheriff Harrell Revell said
Monday night that Bristol resident Charles Hill has offered his
ticket as the winner.
   ``It isn't confirmed,'' Revell said, adding he sent a deputy to
Hill's house as a security precaution as word of mouth spread
through the tiny Florida Panhandle hamlet.
   Hill, who told deputies his ticket got wet sitting in a laundry
pile, is a janitor at a Bristol elementary school, said Revell.
Telephone calls to his house late Monday and early today went
unanswered.
   ``People are really interested,'' said Longwood police Officer
Robert Hemmert, who was flagged down on patrol by residents who
hoped he might know the winner. ``We're up in the air. We're just
as curious as anybody else.''
   Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes.
   Lottery officials expected to project the exact payout of
Saturday night's Lotto drawing today. The annual payment to the
winner will be about $2.16 million each year after taxes, using a
Lottery Department formula that divides total winnings by 20 years
and deducts 20 percent of the yearly windfall for taxes.
   Longwood Mayor David Gunter said he was pleased the winning
ticket was bought in his town.
   ``It might put Longwood on the map now,'' he said.
   The huge jackpot whipped up a ticket-buying avalanche that
pushed Saturday's sales to 14.6 million and total weekly Lotto
purchases to almost 45 million.
   The Florida jackpot topped the previous U.S. record prize for a
numbers game, the $51.4 million shared by two people who bought
winning tickets for California's lottery on June 4.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Isolate Occupied West Bank Town, Set Up Makeshift
Bases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops isolated an occupied West Bank
town today, setting up makeshift army bases, cutting telephone
lines and arresting dozens of Palestinians suspected of inciting
riots, the army and Arab witnesses said.
   During today's operation in Qalqilya, 55 miles north of
Jerusalem, troops discovered stashes of knives, hatchets, clubs,
and underground leaflets outlawed by Israeli authorities, an army
spokesman said.
   Jewish settlers have claimed Palestinians from Qalqilya are key
instigators of firebomb and stone-throwing attacks and complained
they scattered nails on West Bank roads.
   An army spokesman said troops today imposed a pre-dawn curfew
and closed all roads to the town of about 10,000 because the army
planned to carry out an ``operation of several stages.'' He
declined to elaborate.
   In all, five West Bank towns and refugee camps were under curfew
today, confining some 40,000 people to their homes.
   Arab taxi drivers turned back at army roadblocks reported seeing
four helicopters flying overhead and dozens of army vehicles, some
pulling mobile homes that were apparently being used as makeshift
army bases.
   They said troops knocked down a wall separating a playground and
high school and were pitching tents on the grounds.
   Police conducted an overnight arrest campaign in Arab east
Jerusalem, taking 13 Arabs into custody, a spokesman said.
   Security forces also arrested four West Bank Palestinians Monday
night, including two journalists who work for pro-PLO newspapers.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres began the Labor Party's election
campaign with a vow to return occupied territory in exchange for
peace. He said such a move would assure a stronger Israel with a
clear Jewish majority.
   ``We shall rid ourselves of Gaza, we shall rid ourselves of
areas densely populated by Arabs,'' Peres told 3,000 supporters
Monday night in Tel Aviv. ``We shall remain many Jews on much land,
not a Jewish minority with an impossible burden of territories.''
   Peres also called on Palestinians to end the Arab uprising and
start peace talks with Israel.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
258 Palestinians have been killed. Four Israelis have died. The
territories were occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The army, meanwhile, issued orders barring troops from hurling
tear gas into enclosed spaces following an Israeli medical
investigation last May showing the practice endangers human lives.
   The new policy followed charges from Palestinian and
international human rights groups that the gas was being improperly
thrown into closed quarters despite manufacturers specifications
that it be used only in open spaces.
   In a report last month, the London-based human rights group,
Amnesty International said at least seven Palestinians had died as
a result of the improper use of tear gas. The United Nations puts
the number of deaths from tear gassing at 13 since the uprising
began Dec. 8.
   An American tear gas manufacturer, TransTechnology Corp. of
Sherman Oaks, Calif., in May suspended its sale of the riot-control
substance to Israel.
   The army has denied any Palestinians died as a result of tear
gas, contending Amnesty International consulted biased sources.

<HEAD>Dukakis Blasts GOP on Labor Views; Bush Touts New Jobs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new grafs 5-6, 10-13 to update with Bentsen in
Georgia, antiabortion demonstration and Quayle interview</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush, offering
starkly different views of the nation's economy, headed today into
the decisive two months of the 1988 presidential campaign, with
Dukakis saying Republicans ``love to blame American workers first.''
   In a speech prepared for delivery to Polish-Americans in a
Chicago suburb, the Massachusetts governor saluted the Polish union
Solidarity and went on to describe Bush as insensitive to American
workers.
   Bush was campaigning on the West Coast and President Reagan was
hitting the campaign trail on his vice president's behalf.
   Ending a vacation at his California ranch, Reagan was speaking
in Nebraska and to the American Legion convention in Kentucky
before returning to the White House.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen visited a
technical institute in Lawrenceville, Ga., where women were being
trained to make electronic circuit boards.
   ``Education is the key ... to see that we restore the United
States'' as the world's economic leader, he said, adding that the
Republicans have presided over a ``throwing away of the key of
education.''
   During Labor Day appearances and again today, Dukakis recalled
Bush's praise of Soviet tank mechanics during a European trip last
fall.
   ``Send them to Detroit, we could use that kind of ability,''
Bush said after being told of a trouble-free Soviet tank maneuver.
Later, he apologized to U.S. autoworkers, adding, ``Hey give me a
break; I didn't mean anything by it.''
   Dukakis said today, ``Do you really believe we in America have
anything to learn from a society where workers have no rights,
consumers have no choices and even Mr. Gorbachev admits their
economy is a shambles? Those Republicans in Washington love to
blame American workers first.''
   Dukakis' speech was interrupted for about 15 minutes by
demonstrators, who shouted, ``What about abortion?'' and ``Abortion
is murder.''
   Supporters of the candidate chanted back, ``We want Mike.''
Several of the demonstrators were removed from the room by people
in the crowd, and Dukakis proceeded with his remarks. His position
on abortion is that he is personally opposed to it but believes a
pregnant woman has the right to make her own decision.
   In an interview published today in The Washington Post,
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle said he saw
little difference between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his
predecessors. Quayle described Gorbachev's reforms as ``nothing
more than refined Stalinism.''
   The Indiana senator said Gorbachev ``has a different approach to
things and his mannerisms and style are unfortunately pleasing to
the West ... unfortunately because I don't think from an
ideological point of view he's any different from (Leonid) Brezhnev
or anybody else.``
   At a Labor Day rally in Detroit, Dukakis said that during the
nearly eight years of a Republican administration ``the rich have
gotten richer; the poor have gotten poorer.''
   He said millions of high-paying jobs have been replaced by
low-wage positions, and asked: ``Can we afford four more years of
that?''
   Republican rival Bush touted economic gains under the Reagan
administration, saying the administration has created ``17{ million
jobs, more disposable income for the American people, lower taxes.
... And all my opponent can do is tell the American people how bad
things are.''
   The vice president said the campaign is ``about protecting the
gains we've made in jobs and peace and it's about how to make new
breakthroughs in both areas.''
   After full schedules on Labor Day, the symbolic opening of the
fall campaign, the Republican and Democratic candidates _ with the
exception of Quayle _ remained on the road.
   Bentsen joined Dukakis at a Labor Day picnic in St. Louis and
then headed back to the South.
   Quayle was back in Washington after Labor Day appearances at the
Statue of Liberty and at an ethnic parade in Detroit.
   Demonstrators appeared at several events.
   About 125 anti-abortion activists, by police estimates, were at
a Dukakis appearance in Philadelphia. They waved signs and chanted,
``Life yes, abortion no. Duke of death must go.''
   People carrying Dukakis-Bentsen signs stood at the back of the
crowd at a Bush appearance in San Diego and shouted: ``Where was
George?''
   About 30 members of a group called the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power heckled Quayle and said they were protesting his vote against
a $30 million appropriation to provide the drug AZT to AIDS victims.
   Security forces were busy. In San Diego, a man with a stun gun
on his belt was taken into custody at the Bush campaign rally, but
he was later released.
   ``The person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice
president or anyone else there,'' said Steve Sergek, Secret Service
special agent in charge of the San Diego field office.
   The Secret Service said another man, who was carrying what
police believed was a bomb, was arrested in Hamtramck, Mich.,
shortly before Quayle's arrival there. The device turned out to be
a fake.
   The 38-year-old Hamtramck man was arrested on charges of
interfering with a Secret Service agent, said Jim Huse of the
Secret Service's Detroit office.
   Labor Day was an occasion for the candidates to spell out the
positive and negative themes of their campaigns.
   Dukakis and Bentsen pressed their claim that jobs created under
the Republican administration pay less.
   Bush said Dukakis was following ``the standard litany of the
liberal left'' with his opposition to the MX and Midgetman missile
systems, the Star Wars missile defense program, and two new carrier
task forces.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks that a naval exercise is
something you find in Jane Fonda's workout book,'' he said in
reference to the actress who was an active opponent of the Vietnam
War.

   A sniper fired ``a rain of pellets'' from a
high-rise apartment building today, slightly injuring three police
officers and closing a busy Manhattan highway, authorities said.
   Police said they had pinpointed an 11th-floor apartment as the
source of the shots and sent hostage negotiators to talk to a
disgruntled tenant, but the man did not respond.
   Deputy Inspector James Fogerty said the man apparently had a
complaint against the building management.
   The incident began about 6 a.m. when police responded to reports
of shots being fired in the vicinity of the building. The officers
stationed themselves along the FDR Drive beside the East River near
the Brooklyn Bridge.
   Police did not describe the type of weapon used, but First
Deputy Commissioner Richard Condon said ``a rain of pellets'' fell
on the officers.
   Scores of emergency service officers, highway and patrol
officers rushed to the scene, cordoning off a four-block area.
   The busy FDR Drive, a main conduit into Manhattan from Brooklyn,
Queens and the Bronx, was closed in both directions in the area.
   Three pellets superficially wounded three officers. A fourth
struck an officer but did not pierce his skin.
   Fogerty described the man only as being Asian and said he
believes he has two children. Police called for an interpreter who
speaks Mandarin Chinese.
   Fogerty said the man refused to open his door, but police could
hear voices inside the apartment. Police also tried to call the man
but believe his phone may have been disconnected.
   Officers lowered a video camera from the 12th floor to look into
the apartment's windows. Authorities said they could see no people
but spotted furniture barricading the front door.
   Victoria Parker, who lives on the building's 18th floor, said
the man believed to be firig the shots recently moved in and had a
reputation for having a bad temper. ``He gets into it with
management and the tenants,'' she said.

   The government charged today that cash, jewelry,
fine wines and fruits were given to the nation's former chief law
enforcement officer by defendants in the influence-peddling trial
of Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law.
   As the trial before a three-member military tribunal entered its
second day, prosecutors alleged defendants gave former Interior
Minister Nikolai Shchelokov, then the Soviet Union's top police
officer and a protege of Brezhnev, gifts ranging from neckties to
three pearls valued at $5,300 each.
   The indictment, which is being read in court, said Shchelokov
was picky about the gifts he accepted and often refused things that
didn't suit him.
   The charges provided the most detailed account yet of official
corruption at the top levels of the Brezhnev regime.
   Recent newspaper reports say Shchelokov took $1.1 million in
state funds, gave foreign luxury cars to his children and bought
furs and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family.
   He was fired by Brezhnev's successor, Yuri Andropov, and died in
December 1984 at age 73. Shchelokov and his wife are said to have
committed suicide, and the indictment read today confirmed the
former interior minister did indeed kill himself.
   The court documents said boxes of money were left on
Shchelekov's desk and that one of the nine defendants gave him
105,000 rubles ($170,000).
   ``He wanted good, dry wines,'' the indictment said, adding that
the defendants obliged him. Six times a year, shipments from the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan would arrive at a Moscow
airport and be taken to Shchelekov's country home outside the
capital.
   The indictment said the shipments contained cognac, tomatoes as
well as melons, apricots and other fruits unobtainable in Moscow
most of the year.
   When he received gifts he liked, the account said, the interior
minister would politely accept them by saying, ``I thank you.''
   Sometimes, however, he refused to take things he didn't want.
   According to the indictment, Shchelekov once was taken to a
factory in Uzbekistan and offered clothes and other products made
there. He reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of
jewelry for his wife.
   The central figure among the nine defendants, 51-year-old Yuri
Churbanov, was Shchelokov's deputy and could face the death penalty
if convicted on charges he accepted bribes and gifts such as wine,
cognac and grapes flown to him via the Soviet airline Aeroflot from
Uzbekistan.
   One defendant was out sick today, and two others were treated by
a doctor in the courtroom.
   A judge at the military tribunal announced that Khushvan
Norbutaev would not attend today's session, and the defendant's
lawyer, Olga Rakitina, said the former regional police chief from
Uzbekistan was suffering from angina pectoris, a painful but not
necessarily dangerous heart condition.
   She sought a recess, saying her client was entitled to hear
everything that goes on in court, but the judge rejected the
request and a clerk then continued reading the indictment.
   A physician later gave heart medicine to another defendant,
Tashtimir Kakhramanov, and administered stomach pills to D.
Dzhamalov.
   The trial is considered part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to
separate his leadership from the corruption of Brezhnev's rule,
which began in 1964 and ended with the Communist Party chief's 1982
death.
   Churbanov married Galina Brezhnev in 1971. He had worked as a
mechanic before taking a low-level Interior Ministry job in 1961.
   Official media have reported extensively on the trial, which is
expected to last about two months. Some foreign reporters also are
being allowed to attend.
   During Monday's reading of the charges, it was repeatedly
alleged that Churbanov received the bribes from provincial
officials due to his connection with Brezhnev.
   It said the co-defendants were among those who bribed Churbanov.
   Churbanov also requested and received government construction
materials for a summer house, the indictment said.
   He was quoted as saying gift-giving was merely a sign of
friendship in Uzbekistan, a republic in Soviet Central Asia.
   His co-defendants, accused taking bribes as well as giving them,
are former Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev, 61, of Uzbekistan;
his former deputies Pyotr Begelman and Kakhramanov, and former
regional police chiefs identified as Norbutaev, S. Sabirov,
Dzhamalov, M. Norov and Y. Makhamadzhanov.
   According to Pravda, beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests in
Uzbekistan were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, with the
government made to pay for the non-existent crop by corrupt
officials.
   ``Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more
than 4 billion rubles ($6.34 billion) from the state, half of which
they stuffed into their own pockets,'' the official Communist Party
daily reported earlier this year.

   Michael Dukakis today criticized George Bush for
saying U.S. auto plants could use the abilities of Soviet
mechanics, and he accused the Reagan administration of ``trying to
break unions and pit management against labor.''
   Last fall on a trip to Europe, Bush said he'd been told in a
meeting of NATO ministers that 350 Soviet tanks had recently
completed maneuvers without a breakdown.
   ``Hey, when the mechanics who keep those tanks running run out
of work in the Soviet Union, send them to Detroit because we could
use that kind of ability,'' Bush said at the time. Later, he
apologized to U.S. autoworkers, adding, ``Hey give me a break; I
didn't mean anything by it.''
   Dukakis, in a meeting today with hundreds of Polish-Americans
and others at a banquet hall outside Chicago, praised the Polish
workers' union Solidarity while taking aim at Reagan administration
labor policies.
   ``They don't understand that Solidarity isn't just a beautiful
word in Polish; it's also a beautiful word in English,'' Dukakis
said. ``That's why they've spent the last seven years trying to
break unions and pit management againstqbor.''
   The Democratic nominee chided Bush for the vice president's
remarks about Soviet mechanics.
   ``I agree we have to pay attention to quality _ from the
assembly lines to the executive suites,'' Dukakis said. ``But do
you really believe we in America have anything to learn from a
society where workers have no rights, consumers have no choices and
even Mr. Gorbachev admits their economy is a shambles? Those
Republicans in Washington love to blame American workers first.''
   Dukakis' speech was interrupted for about 15 minutes by
demonstrators, who shouted, ``What about abortion?'' and ``Abortion
is murder.''
   Supporters of the candidate chanted back, ``We want Mike.''
Several of the demonstrators were removed from the room by people
in the crowd, and Dukakis proceeded with his remarks. His position
on abortion is that he is personally opposed to it but believes a
pregnant woman has the right to make her own decision.
   There was scuffling, but police said there were no arrests.
   One of the demonstrators, Richard Freeman, said several
anti-abortion groups met a week ago and decided to organize
protests. ``If Dukakis is within 300 miles of a pro-life activist,
we're going to go out and greet him,'' he said.
   As Freeman spoke to reporters he was jostled by other people in
the crowd, one of whom ripped his jacket.
   One spectator obviously upset by the demonstators, Marion Reis,
said he opposes abortion and has donated money to pro-life groups.
He said he would make no further donations, adding, ``I think
they're full of hate, not full of love.''
   Dukakis was also to meet in Illinois today with state Democratic
leaders, but Jesse Jackson was not included.
   Jackson was very upset over the omission, the latest in a series
of what he has perceived as slights by the Dukakis campaign, said a
source close to the former presidential candidate.
   Another confidant said Jackson has expressed concern about his
contacts with the Dukakis campaign, and ``whether or not he's going
to be able to do what he could and should do for the ticket.''
   Both sources spoke on condition they not be identified by name.
   In Illinois, Dukakis' state press secretary Judy Erwin said
Jackson was not included in the meetings because he is regarded as
a national leader and today's meetings were to focus on the
Illinois state campaign.
   Dukakis' remarks today about Bush marked a continuation of the
effort Dukakis has made in the past week to portray his Republican
rival as out of touch with average Americans.
   From Illinois Dukakis was heading to another key industrial
state, Ohio, after marking the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the
fall campaign Monday with appearances in Pennsylvania, Michigan and
Missouri.
   While Dukakis campaigned, his top campaign aides were to resume
discussions with the Bush camp on a fall debate schedule.
   After an appearance in St. Louis on Monday, Dukakis sized up the
final nine weeks of his contest with Bush as a ``tough, competitive
race'' he believes will swing on which candidate that low- and
moderate-income Americans believe is most qualified to direct the
nation's economy.
   Dukakis said he hoped to keep the focus on substantive issues
but said it has become clear in recent weeks that Republicans are
more intent on attacking him personally.
   ``If they want a tough, aggressive campaign, I'm happy to give
it to them,'' Dukakis said. ``The signs are good and we're raring
to go.''
   At all of his Monday stops and again today Dukakis criticized
Bush for calling last month's rise in national unemployment
``statistically irrelevant,'' portraying the vice president as the
standard bearer of the rich and insensitive to the needs of working
Americans.
   ``I don't think he really understands average Americans very
well,'' Dukakis said in a meeting with local reporters in St.
Louis. ``I don't think he really understands what average families
are going through these days.''
   The Massachusetts governor, repeatedly invoking the theme
``bring prosperity home,'' said the Reagan-Bush legacy will leave
families working harder than eight years ago to pay their bills,
with millions unable to afford new homes or college educations for
their children.

   Temperatures dipped to record lows at nearly 30 cities today
from the Plains to New England and as far south as Arkansas when
Canadian air surged southward, and heavy rain caused flooding in
parts of northern Florida.
   Temperatures dipped into the 40s as far south as Tennessee and a
few spots in Minnesota and North Dakota reported lows at freezing
or lower with a reading of 31 degrees at Hibbing, Minn.
Indianapolis tied its coldest temperature for so early in the fall
at 44 degrees, a record that has stood since 1885.
   Most of the record lows were in the 40s, with some in the 50s in
Tennessee and Arkansas, but records were in the 30s in parts of
Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and upstate New York.
   High wind and almost 6 inches swept much of Florida for the
second day today, flooding streets and highways, knocking out
power, blowing down trees and threatening some low-lying coastal
areas with erosion.
   Gainesville reported 5.83 inches of rain in a 24-hour period
ending at 8 a.m., and the National Weather Service said nearly 4
inches of that fell in the last six hours of the reporting period.
   Minor flooding was reported throughout west-central Florida, and
above-normal tides and minor coastal erosion were expected from
Cedar Key to Venice, the weather service said.
   Wind gusts to 40 mph were reported at Tampa International
Airport, and the weather service said gusts of more than 60 mph had
been reported but not confirmed.
   Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C., received just over
two-thirds of an inch of rain in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   The sky remained smoky over Wyoming, southern Montana and Idaho
because of forest fires, reducing visibility to as little as 3
miles in some locations Monday.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over
southern Georgia and the Florida peninsula, and scattered showers
along the coasts of North Carolina and Washington state. Mostly
sunny skies were predicted for most other regions.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s in northern Maine; in the
60s from northern New England to the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley
and the upper Mississippi Valley, and along the Northwest coast; in
the 90s in central and northwest Texas, the central and southern
Plateau, parts of Colorado, western Wyoming, central Montana and
southern Florida; and between 100 and 110 degrees in the desert
Southwest and inland California valleys. Highs elsewhere were
expected to be in the 70s and 80s.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 35 degrees at Hibbing,
Minn., to 87 at Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>Union Leader Finally Gets To Testify In Treason Trial</HEAD>

   A prominent black union leader
accused of leading an attempted political takeover of a black
township took the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his
year-old treason trial.
   Moses Mayekiso, head of the country's largest metalworkers
union, and four co-defendants are charged with seeking to usurp
state authority and install their anti-apartheid civic group as an
alternative government in Alexandra.
   The 39-year-old activist, whose release has been demanded by
many international labor groups, testified about his impoverished
childhood and experiences as an illegal migrant worker after he
moved to the Johannesburg area in the early 1970s.
   ``White people lived in civilized places, but next door in
Alexandra, black people lived in a place where pigs would live,''
said Mayekiso, who will continue his testimony Wednesday.
   Once a squalid slum wedged amidst white Johannesburg suburbs,
Alexandra has been upgraded extensively by the government since
Mayekiso's arrest in June 1986.
   The trial has attracted international attention because of
Mayekiso's position as general secretary of the National Union of
Metalworkers of South Africa and because many activists view the
prosecution as an attempt to stifle legitimate, peaceful opposition
activity.
   The government alleges that the defendants organized rent and
consumer boycotts, sought to undermine the security forces, and
established ``people's courts'' in 1985-86, the height of
nationwide black unrest.
   Alexandra was one of the most militant black townships at the
time, and dozens of people were killed in clashes with security
forces.
   In the past two years, the government has sought to restore
control by detaining or restricting leaders of Mayekiso's Alexandra
Action Committee while undertaking a $45 million redevlopment
program in which sewage, electricity and paved streets are being
provided to most of the 100,000 residents.
   Many of the state witnesses who testified during the early
stages of the treason trial were businessmen who said they suffered
from boycotts enforced by the action committee.
   Under cross-examination, some of these witnesses said the local
crime rate dropped when young supporters of the action committee
began an anti-crime campaign.
   Another highly publicized court case reaches a critical stage
Wednesday when lawyers for the Sharpeville Six appear before the
Appeal Court to challenge the dismissal of a motion to reopen the
murder trial of their black clients.
   The five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for their
roles in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor. There have
been an extensive worldwide campaign appealing to President P.W.
Botha to grant clemency.
   In June, a lower court judge rejected a defense motion to reopen
the trial to consider new evidence.
   At Wednesday's hearing in Bloemfontein, the defense lawyers will
be asking the Appeal Court _ South Africa's highest court _ to
allow a full appeal of the judge's decision.

<HEAD>Dissidents Demand Release Of Political Prisoners Before Olympics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident groups called Tuesday for
the release of about 700 political prisoners before the Olympics
and charged the Games were being used to enforce dictatorial rule.
   The 16 groups issued an appeal to the ``peace lovers'' of the
161 nations taking part in the Olympics to help obtain the release
of all political prisoners before the Games begin Sept. 17.
   Kim Kun-tae, a top dissident, told a news conference attended by
80 other dissidents that the Olympics are being used to cement
military rule. He charged the Games will be a mockery if any
political prisoners remain behind bars.
   ``The Seoul Olympics ... is not an event to pursue global peace
but to forcibly reinforce the dictatorship and legitimize
violence,'' the groups said in a joint statement.
   The South Korean government says all political prisoners have
been released except for dissidents convicted of violent crimes or
communism. Hundreds of political prisoners were freed over the past
year.
   Kim, who was released from prison in June, said 370 people are
serving sentences for opposing the government and more than 300
others are awaiting trial on political charges.
   The government says there about 250 dissidents serving criminal
sentences or awaiting trial on such charges.
   The dissidents also denounced communist North Korea's exclusion
from the Olympics and called for reunification of the divided
Korean peninsula. They said the Games were being used to make the
division permanent.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics because its
demand to co-host the Games was turned down. The International
Olympic Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and
could not be shared.
   The dissidents also charged the Olympics were being staged by
the government of President Roh Tae-woo to enhance its prestige and
cement authoritarian rule.
   ``The dehumanizing torture and terror will not cease and at this
very moment, under the euphemism of `peace during the Olympics,'
more people will be arrested,'' the groups said in a statement.
   They urged other nations to help them fight the government.
   ``We ask for your full-fledged support in our difficult fight
for national sovereignty, democracy and reunification and
resistance to Roh's military dictatorial regime,'' the statement
said.
   The dissidents also demanded withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections in
Decmeber, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled
authoritarian controls imposed by former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Dissident groups contend the government is a front for continued
authoritarian rule by the military and there has been no democratic
progress. The dissidents and radical anti-government students have
little or no public support and Roh's popularity has been growing.
   Most Koreans want the Olympics to be a major success. The Games
are seen as a way to propel the nation into the forefront of newly
developed nations and continue its rapid industrial development.
   In another development, South Korea has temporarily halted
foreign adoption of its babies to avoid possible controversy during
the Olympics.
   The government has not officially confirmed the ban, but
adoption agencies acknowledged they were asked to stop sending
babies overseas for adoption for two months before and during the
Olympics. South Korea sends about 7,000 children abroad annually
for adoption in the United States and Europe.

   Hailstones the size of goose eggs injured more
than 2,000 people and damaged 8,500 acres of cropland in northern
China's Hebei province, an official report said Tuesday.
   The hailstorm in Cangzhou county came so suddenly Saturday
afternoon that pedestrians were caught in the streets and people
inside did not have time to shut the windows, the Economic Daily
said.
   About six inches of hail fell in an outlying district of
Cangzhou, with lesser amounts recorded in the county's city, towns
and villages, it said.
   China has suffered many natural disasters this year, including
severe flooding in the northeast, coastal and southern provinces;
drought in the central provinces; and storms and typhoons in the
south and along the coast.

   Five people, including a village chief, were
sentenced to death by firing squad for the ritual killing of a
38-year-old woman.
   Baffour Twene, 52, his wife and three co-defendants were
convicted Monday of murdering Lamley Sampa on Feb. 23 and using
parts of her body in a ritual ceremony. Mrs. Sampa was abducted in
the northern region of Brong Ahafo.
   The details of the ritual were not described during the trial.
   Twene and the other defendants were tried before a regional
court at Sunyani, 260 miles northwest of the capital of Accra.
   Courtroom spectators applauded the guilty verdict. Court
chairman K.F. Otu-Essel called the killing barbaric and said such
practices must end.
   Two weeks ago, four people, including a tribal chief, were
sentenced to death by firing squad in a similar case in the western
region of Sefwi Bekwai.

   The freighter Karin B., carrying 2,100 tons of
unwanted toxic wastes, weighed anchor Tuesday off the Normandy
coast to sail back to Italy, where the wastes began their long
journey, the government said.
   The ship was resupplied with food, water and fuel Monday night
in international waters off Cherbourg, the French Ministry of the
Ocean said.
   The chemical wastes orginally were shipped from Italy to
Nigeria, where they were dumped illegally. Nigerian authorities
seized an Italian ship to back up their demand that Italy pick up
the wastes and take them away.
   The Karin B. was one of two ships chartered by the Italian
government in July to carry the wastes back to Europe. France,
Britain, Spain, West Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands all
refused entry to the ship.
   Italy said on Friday that the ship could return and unload its
cargo.

   Firefighters, worried it would start
``raining fire'' today, hosed down houses and bolstered lines
against blazes that have blackened nearly 1 million acres in and
around Yellowstone National Park.
   County authorities declared a state of emergency today in Cooke
City and Silver Gate, just outside the park, and sheriff's deputies
fanned out to order lingering townspeople to leave their homes. The
declaration authorized the sheriff's office to forcibly remove
anyone who didn't leave the threatened areas voluntarily.
   Southwesterly winds 20 to 30 mph were expected in the
Yellowstone area after relatively light winds Monday. Strong winds
also whipped a 160-acre fire in north-central Washington from 160
acres Monday to more than 20,000 acres today.
   Authorities had feared the changing winds could send embers and
flames into the two small towns from the advancing 61,300-acre
Storm Creek blaze.
   ``We have about a 25 percent chance of holding the fire out of
these two communities,'' David Liebersbach, incident commander in
Silver Gate, said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show this morning.
   ``With these winds, it will be heroic, a real success to save
some of these buildings,'' said fire information officer Pat
Kaunert.
   Elsewhere in Yellowstone, the 142,000-acre North Fork fire
burned to within a few miles of the Old Faithful geyser, but
authorities were optimistic the fire would not reach the tourist
attraction.
   ``The fire's about four miles from Old Faithful. So if we do get
those predicted winds we could have some problems there, but I
think we have a good chance,'' said Bob Barbee, Yellowstone
National Park superintendant, also appearing on ``Today.''
   Thirteen fires in and around Yellowstone have scorched 900,000
acres, and should top 1 million acres today after aerial surveys
are completed, Gary Cargill, head of the U.S. Forest Service in
Denver, said at a news conference in Bozeman. About 300,000 more
acres could burn this week, he said.
   In Washington, a fast-growing fire in the eastern Cascade hills
destroyed one home and threatened others, said Nick Mickel of the
state Department of Natural Resources. He said he did not know how
many homes or how near they were to the fire.
   The fire, about six miles west of Entiat, was burning on steep
hills covered with sage, grass, pine, and some Douglas fir, and was
beginning to butt up against some orchards in Washington's premier
fruit-growing region, Mickel said.
   The fire was reported Sunday and pegged at 160 acres Monday
morning. By 4:30 p.m. it grew to 500 acres. But when 20 mph
westerly winds moved in, it accelerated rapidly to 3,000 acres by
7:30 p.m. and 20,000 by 4 a.m. today, Mickel said.
   That fire and others across the state prompted Gov. Booth
Gardner to call out the National Guard late Monday, mainly to help
transport firefighting crews to blazes in central and eastern
Washington. A 12,500-acre fire near the White Mountain Complex,
about 75 miles northwest of Spokane, had been the state's largest
fire.
   In Idaho, 13 forest fires raged out of control. A new fire broke
out Monday seven miles north of Island Park, on the western edge of
the massive North Fork fire that burned out of Yellowstone during
the weekend, forcing an estimated 150-200 summer cabin owners to
evacuate.
   In Silver Gate and Cooke City near Yellowstone's northeastern
entrance, all but 30 of the approximately 150 residents had
evacuated.
   ``Some of them are staying around because they want to see what
the fire does,'' said Bob Fry, an emergency services official.
``They're mostly packed up, though, and we're trying to push them
out.''
   Mild winds blew ash and smoke toward the towns Monday afternoon.
   Fire lines were completed Monday around Silver Gate and nearly
completed around Cooke City, said fire information officer Sue
Consolo.
   About 75 trucks were called in from as far away as Nevada to
protect buildings in the communities. Firefighters also doused
homes with water.
   Hopes of burning out fuels from a two-mile swath in the fire's
path were dashed when backfires failed to burn as expected, leaving
towns with less protection than officials had wanted.
   Forest Service officials in northwest Montana also prepared an
evacuation plan for homes in a residential area south of the tiny
town of Fortine.
   ``Right now, we've got our fingers crossed that this wind isn't
going to be that harsh,'' said spokesman Dick Guth, stressing that
residents would be asked to leave only if winds materialize. The
blaze jumped over some lines and grew to an estimated 12,300 acres.
   While the forecast for brisk winds worried officials at most
fires in the region, it was welcomed at the 54,270-acre Hellroaring
Creek fire burning in Montana's Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and
south into Yellowstone.
   Spokesman Stephanie Gibert said the expected southwest winds
would allow firefighters to set backfires that would burn into the
main blaze.
   Elsewhere, a blaze that has charred more than 20,000 acres in
Southern California's Los Angeles and Ventura counties continued to
burn out of control today, but fire dispatcher Annie Ironside said
containment was anticipated late this evening.
   Oregon's largest fire of the season was nearly contained at just
under 57,000 acres in the rugged Hell's Canyon National Recreation
Area.
   In northern Utah, fire officials said a fire burning near
Paradise that was thought to be 250 acres was really only 5 acres.
Heavy smoke was blamed for the error, said Ray Tate, an Interagency
Fire Center spokesman.

<HEAD>China Wants To Launch American Satellites Aboard Its Rockets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese officials on Tuesday asked Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to press the Reagan administration to
allow American satellites to be shipped to China and launched into
space aboard its missiles.
   Carlucci, who is visiting China for the first time, met for more
than three hours Tuesday with National Defense Minister Qin Jiwei.
He also held talks with other officials, including Premier Li Peng
and Vice Premier Wu Xueqian.
   A Senior Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Carlucci also discussed U.S. concerns over Chinese
arms sales to nations in the Middle East _ a sore point in
Sino-American relations.
   The Reagan Administration is considering whether to grant
licenses to export U.S.-made satellites to China, where they would
be launched aboard the so-called Long March boosters.
   Two companies have applied for such export licenses _ Hughes
Aircraft Co. and Asiasat, a Hong Kong-based company that purchased
Hughes satellites, according to Don O'Neal, director of
communications for the Hughes Space and Communications Group, based
in El Secundo, Calif.
   ``There are rumors (the launches from China) may be as much as
50 percent cheaper'' than the French or American shuttle programs,
O'Neal said on Tuesday. He said he could not speculate on the exact
costs of Chinese launches.
   The U.S. shuttle program was sidelined by the explosion aboard
the Challenger in Jan. 28, 1986 in which all seven people aboard
were killed.
   O'Neal said Hughes is applying for a licence for two of
telecommunications satellites bought by the Australian company
Aussat. He said the satellites are owned by Hughes until they are
launched under a ``delivery in orbit'' contract with the Australian
company, which has chosen China as the launch site.
   Hughes has received no response to its license application,
which was made in July, according to O'Neal.
   Asiasat owns a Hughes-made Westar 6 satellite that was launched
by the U.S. shuttle in 1984 but failed to reach its proper orbit.
It was recovered by the shuttle in 1985, O'Neal said, will be
refurbished in the United States. Asiasat must have a U.S. license
to export it to China so it can be launched again.
   The State Department recommended the licenses be approved, but
the Commerce Department and some Republican congressmen say
allowing China to launch U.S. satellites will undercut U.S.
companies developing the same service.
   On the arms issue, the United States has strongly urged China to
curtail sales of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and voiced
concern over the recent sale of ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia.
China denied selling arms to Iran.
   Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Xin told reporters Tuesday that China
has not sold its M-9 medium range missiles to Syria, as reported by
foreign news agencies.
   On Wednesday, Carlucci is to meet with senior Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping.

   A malfunction of a Soviet spacecraft's guidance
system today forced two cosmonauts to delay their return to Earth
for one day. A newspaper said their life support systems would last
just two more days and food was running low.
   Aboard the Soyuz-TM 5 capsule were Abdul Ahad Mohmand, 29, the
first Afghan in space, and Soviet crewmate Vladimir Lyakhov, 47.
They were returning from the orbiting space station Mir, where they
spent six days.
   The government daily Izvestia and the Tass news agency said life
support systems aboard the capsule are designed to last two days.
   However, a Soviet space official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the cosmonauts could stretch supplies of oxygen,
water and food for up to a week. He did not explain how the oxygen
supply could be stretched out.
   Izvestia reported this exchange between mission control and the
cosmonauts:
   ``How are things with food?'' a mission controller asked.
   ``There is no food,'' said Lyakhov.
   ``But in the accident reserves?'' the controller asked.
   ``There is some, but why touch it? We will endure,'' said
Lyakhov.
   The problems began shortly after the Soyuz capsule disengaged
from the orbiting station Mir at 2:55 a.m. Moscow time, Izvestia
and Tass reported.
   The capsule had brought Lyakhov, Mohmand and Soviet doctor
Valery Polyakov to the Mir on Aug. 31. Polyakov stayed aboard the
Mir to monitor the health of two other cosmonauts, who have been in
space for more than eight months.
   An engine used to slow the Soyuz for re-entry through the
Earth's atmosphere fired automatically while the vehicle was out of
radio contact with ground controllers, Izvestia said. When contact
was restored, Lyakhov reported: ``Accident! The engine worked 60
seconds and shut off. A violation of the stabilization regime.''
   Controllers decided to delay another re-entry attempt for three
hours, and in the meantime scientists discovered that an infrared
guidance system had malfunctioned and a computer automatically
terminated the engine burn prematurely, Izvestia said. The burn was
supposed to have lasted 230 seconds.
   Seven minutes later, the guidance system was activated
automatically again and started the engine, but would have put the
capsule on a trajectory for a landing in China, instead of its
intended destination, the Soviet Central Asian republic of
Kazakhstan, the newspaper said. The cosmonauts manually cut off the
engine burn after three seconds.
   ``We will postpone the landing until tomorrow,'' mission chief
Valery Ryumin, himself a cosmonaut, told Izvestia. ``Don't worry,
nothing terrible has happened yet. The life support system will
last for two days.''
   Radio Moscow said the Soyuz cosmonauts ``are feeling well and
there is reliable communication between the aircraft and mission
control.'' It said the landing was postponed so as ``not to take
risks'' and to allow time for a new re-entry trajectory to be
programmed into the capsule's computer.
   The Tass and Izvestia reports did not say whether it was
possible Mohmand and Lyakhov could return to Mir if they are unable
to get guidance systems to work properly.
   Aboard Mir, Polyakov was monitoring the health of cosmonauts
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who are trying to break a 326-day
endurance record set by Yuri Romanenko. They have been in space
since last Dec. 21.
   Lyakhov and Mohmand helped Titov and Manarov conduct medical,
geological and other experiments during their six-day stay on the
research station.

   A hydraulic system on a Continental Airlines

authorities said Tuesday.
   Continental Flight 475, an Airbus A-300 from Houston, landed at
8:46 p.m. Monday at Los Angeles International Airport, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell. The pilot had
radioed that the system that lowers the landing gear had failed.
   ``Basically they had to mechanically extend the landing gear,''
O'Donnell said. ``It landed without incident and taxied off the

   A man threatening to commit suicide by
jumping from an overpass over the busy Hollywood Freeway tied up
rush-hour traffic today for 90 minutes before he was pushed off
onto an airbag, authorities said.
   Clarence Hunter, believed to be in his 50s, began threatening to
jump from the Alameda Street overpass about 4:20 a.m., according to
California Highway Patrol Officer Dwight McDonald.
   Police pushed Hunter off the overpass after he began moving back
and forth on the bridge, police Lt. Les Lutz said. ``He was
becoming less communicative and was making more threats to jump.''
   While police awaited their crisis negotiator, the Fire
Department inflated an air bag and moved it into place on the
southbound lanes of the freeway. When Hunter then threatened to set
his shirt on fire, officers pushed him off the bridge, Lutz said.
   ``We assisted him. We pushed him out the bridge onto the airbag
to prevent him from setting his shirt on fire. He was not
injured,'' Lutz said.
   Hunter was taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center for
observation.
   The incident created a huge traffic jam during the morning rush
hour, backing up the freeway in both directions until about 6:20
a.m., McDonald said.
   A check of Hunter's background revealed he had attempted to jump
from a Glendale Freeway overpass last month, Lutz said.
   Glendale police Sgt. Bill Fishback said Hunter was on the Holly
Drive overpass for 2{ hours Aug. 24 before being rescued.

   Fofo I.F. Sunia, the non-voting delegate from
American Samoa, officially resigned from the House on Tuesday a
month after his guilty plea in a payroll padding scheme.
   The resignation of Sunia, a four-term Democrat, came a day
before the House ethics committee planned to hold a disciplinary
hearing against him and a staff accomplice, former administrative
assistant Matthew Iuli.
   The resignation ended the ethics panel's jurisdiction over
Sunia, since it can only discipline current members and employees
of the House.
   Sunia and Iuli admitted in U.S. district court Aug. 3 that they
ran a scheme to defraud the government of more than $130,000. Iuli
resigned last week.
   The two men pleaded guilty to placing 14 ghost employees on
Sunia's congressional payroll between 1983 and 1986.
   Federal investigators found that the ``employees''' payroll
checks were deposited into Iuli's bank account or Sunia's
re-election fund.
   The U.S. attorney's office said Sunia and Iuli used the money to
entertain constituents, pay election and campaign expenses and make
house and car loan payments.
   Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 4. The maximum penalty for each
man is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Gov. A.P. Lutali of American Samoa has said that candidates'
names will appear on the November ballot twice, once to fill
Sunia's unexpired term and a second time for a full two-year term
in the 101st Congress that begins in January.

   Mayor Maureen O'Connor has gained some new

seventh-largest city.
   For 48 hours, she was one of them.
   O'Connor, 41, wife of Robert O. Peterson, millionaire founder of
Jack in the Box restaurants, spent two days and nights over the
Labor Day weekend living the life of a transient.
   The mayor was rousted from resting spots, watched drug dealers
do business, witnessed gay prostitutes luring clients into bushes,
spent a night in a park, and sought help from government agencies.
   ``It was a lifetime in 48 hours. No one could ever put into a

feet Sunday.
   Only three people recognized her _ two homeless women and a

<HEAD>Relic Of 1968 Campus Violence Finally To Be Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 20 years after Columbia University
began building a gymnasium, a project abandoned after violent
demonstrations rocked the campus in 1968, the empty foundation hole
will be turned into a park pond.
   Stopping construction of the gym was one of the aims of the
uprising, in which university buildings were taken over by campus
radicals who called the project racist. Others complained it took
away part of Morningside Park.
   New York City's Parks Department plans to put $12 million into
rehabilitating the park in the next 10 years. Columbia is
contributing $500,000 to the project, said spokesman Fred Knubel.
   The now-overgrown hole will become a pond, said Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern.
   While opposition to the Vietnam War and mistrust of institutions
in general also fueled the campus revolt, protesters called the gym
a perfect example of racism practiced by white, elite Columbia
against its neighbors in poor, black Harlem.
   Columbia designed the $12 million gym to be shared with the
black community, saying it would not only provide recreation but
also bring law-abiding residents back to a park taken over by
muggers.
   The protesters, however, harped on the two entrances planned for
the gym _ one for students on the Morningside Heights campus atop
the park's scarp, the other for the community at the building's
base in the valley below.
   Columbia's argument that the lower entrance would spare users a
long, steep climb through the park was largely overwhelmed by the
symbolism of upper and lower entrances.
   Other opposition came from conservationists, who objected to the
gym taking away two acres in the central section of the 31-acre
park.
   The issue of whether it is safe to use the park remains. Another
institution bordering Morningside, the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine, organized a ``reclaim-the-park'' program Saturday. It
consisted of a march and music and art programs to get people back
into the park and ``push the pushers out.''
   Stern called it a good idea, but said the park was lightly used
because ``mostly it's a slope and it needs rehabilitation.''
   He said ball fields in the flat areas would be fixed up, new
lighting installed and a new path cut with ``shorter steps that
will make it easier, simpler and safer to go up and across the
park.''

   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker received a
two-day extension today on a deadline to produce a $3 million line
of credit supporting his bid to regain control of the television
ministry and religious theme park.
   At a news conference this afternoon outside the Heritage USA
park offices, bankruptcy court trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said he
gave Bakker until Thursday to prove he has the money to regain the
empire he lost in a sex-and-money scandal.
   Benton, who had set today as the deadline, said the reason for
the delay was that attorneys were still working out final details
of the contract for Bakker to buy PTL.
   Benton said he was convinced that Bakker had the $3 million but
said the contract would not be completed until Wednesday at the
earliest.
   A jubilant Bakker told reporters he expected to have the $3
million by the end of the day.
   Benton said Bakker's total bid now is $172 million, up from the
$165 million that had been reported, and that Bakker needs to
present him with a bonafide plan for $74 million of the financing
by Friday.
   Bakker's bid is scheduled to be presented to U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds on Saturday. Benton said he would not rule out
the possibility that other offers also would be presented to the
judge.
   Bakker said he has $2.9 million in cash and pledges already, and
expects to top $3 million by the end of the day.
   ``It looks like it's all going to be there,'' Bakker said
earlier today about the $3 million line of credit.
   Meeting with reporters at the World Outreach Center executive
offices of PTL, he acknowledged he did not have the entire amount
yet, saying, ``We might be $100,000 or $200,000 short.''
   Asked when he expected to have it all, he said, ``By midnight
tonight.''
   Bakker said he spent the morning at the Jim and Tammy Ministries
office answering telephones.
   Bakker and his attorney, Jim Toms, said Monday they were certain
supporters will donate the money needed to satisfy PTL bankruptcy
trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.
   ``To come up with $3 million in a holiday weekend I had to pray
and say, `God help me,''' Bakker said.
   ``We are sort of running our own Labor Day telethon without a
television station,'' he said. ``I'm not going to leave any stone
unturned. I'm not going to stumble now.''
   Bakker said a group of people was working on raising the
remaining $1 million in $1,000 pledges and he has set up a trust
account at a Hendersonville, N.C., bank to accept donations. Those
donations would be used only if he and his wife, Tammy Faye,
succeeded in purchasing the ministry, he said.
   Benton asked for the money as a sign of Bakker's ability to
follow through on his offer for the Heritage USA Christian theme
park, a satellite TV network and undeveloped property near the Fort
Mill ministry.
   Bakker leads the bidding for the assets of the ministry that
went into bankruptcy protection soon after he left in March 1987.
Bakker stepped down after admitting to a sexual encounter with
church secretary Jessica Hahn and after the ministry paid her hush
money.

   No, Lisa Pupo doesn't need a husband, a
boyfriend or even a date. But more than 56,800 football fans may
think so.
   At Sunday afternoon's National Football League game between the
Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers, an airplane flew over
Three Rivers Stadium with a banner reading, ``LISA PUPO _ 30 _
SINGLE.'' The banner included Miss Pupo's home telephone number.
   ``It was a prank, and a pretty smooth one, by my law partners,''
Miss Pupo said later.
   She said partners Mike Burns and David White ``were so nice''
last week in offering her the law firm's tickets to the season
opener. So she invited her parents and two friends, including her
boyfriend, Pat Lenihas.
   ``I must have gotten 200 phone calls. I got calls even before
the game was over,'' she said.
   ``I highly recommend it for someone who really is looking for a
date,'' she said. ``I got marriage proposals, a couple of perverted
calls, a lot of pretty sincere callers and even a woman who wanted
to know why I would do such a thing.''
   She promised to retaliate against her partners. She told The
Pittsburgh Press that Burns, for example, ``is very good looking
and real rich.''

   The parachutist from Orono celebrated her 30th on Monday with 30
jumps from a plane.
   Alternately jumping, re-rigging, and taking off to jump again,
Schoonover spent the afternoon and early evening performing the
feat at the Pittsfield airport.
   At one point in the day she reached a turnaround rate of eight

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush
told a group of jeering shipyard workers today that ``the Democrats
are trying to mislead you'' and promised that if he is elected he
would provide more jobs for Americans.
   ``Listen to this one now,'' Bush told a group of about 250
workers who booed loudly as the vice president spoke at an iron
works. ``I know the truth sometimes hurts.''
   The crowd chanted, ``Union Buster,'' but Bush contined to speak
in a loud voice, telling the workers, ``The Democrats are trying to
mislead you. Things aren't going to get worse unless they get
elected.''
   It was the most hostile audience the GOP nominee has encountered
since winning the nomination last month. Bush conceded that Oregon
is a state where he is trailing Democratic rival Michael Dukakis.
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force II en route from Los
Angeles, Bush accused Dukakis of waging a negative campaign.
   ``He has to tear down. He has to make everything negative to be
elected. I don't have to be responding to him,'' the vice president
said.
   At the Northwest Marine shipyard, Bush toured a Navy oil
refueling boat and then spoke to a group of iron workers alongside
the ship, stressing the jobs theme and his claim that the Reagan
administration has helped to create more than 17 million new jobs
   Many of the hard-hat workers carried anti-Bush signs that
accused him of being anti-union, including one that said, ``Union
Busting, Scab-Loving Bush.''
   Although Bush was booed and hooted during his speech, he did win
a few cheers from the audience when he told the group, ``I'm proud
to be part of an administration ... that decided we're not going to
wear the `kick me' signs anymore.''
   Bush said he thought the election was going to be ``a referendum
on the direction of America's future'' and said that his single
most important goal was ``that everybody who wants a job should
have a job ... a good job at good wages, he (Dukakis) may talk
about it but we delivered it.''
   He was to tour another plant in Everett, Wash.
   On a related matter, a Bush spokeswoman said campaign chairmen
for the two presidential candidates spoke this morning by telephone
and made ``some progress'' on a debate schedule.
   Alixe Glen said Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas and Bush
chairman James Baker III will resume negotiations by phone on
Wednesday on dates and a format for the presidential debates.
   The Republican presidential nominee, at a Labor Day waterfront
rally in San Diego, accused Dukakis of a ``negative ideology
against weapons.''
   And, he said at the Navy base town, ``I wouldn't be surprised if
he thinks a naval exercise is something you find in `The Jane Fonda
Workout Book.'''
   Bush told the San Diego audience that the two central issues of
the campaign were ``jobs and peace ... and how to make new
breakthroughs in both areas.''
   Recent public opinion polls suggest Bush is three to seven
points behind Dukakis in California, which has 47 electoral votes.
Dukakis is also viewed as stronger in Oregon, and, to a lesser
degree, in Washington.
   Bush aides say polling done by the campaign is becoming
increasingly pivotal in determining the vice president's campaign
schedule.
   Many surveys suggest that the race, nationwide, is close to a
dead heat.

<HEAD>Salt-Filled Warehouse Has Become Haven for Homeless Boys, Paper

<TEXT>
   The city will clear out homeless youths living
in a rat-infested salt warehouse and try to direct them to more
appropriate facilities, a Sanitation Department official said
Tuesday.
   ``We have had problems in the past keeping both homeless and
runaways from our facilities,'' said Vito Turso, chief spokesman
for the Sanitation Department. ``We chase them out. They come back.
We chase them out again. They come back again.''
   Turso's remarks came after the New York Post reported Tuesday
that dozens of homeless boys, some of whom work as prostitutes,
lived in the salt-filled warehouse and in an adjacent row of
broken-down garbage trucks in Manhattan.
   This time, Turso said, sanitation workers will be issued cards
with the telephone number of a runaway hot line to hand out. ``I
guess the answer to the problem is not to keep chasing them out to
nowhere but to chase them out to somewhere they can get help,'' he
said.
   Atop a garbage-strewn mountain of salt, which is used on city
streets in the winter, is a shantytown of mattresses and crates,
where the boys cook, eat, sleep and play, the Post said.
   The newspaper said some youths stay for weeks or months. Turso
maintained that the Sanitation Department chases away the youths
and clears out their mattresses whenever a new load of salt is
delivered, most recently three weeks ago.
   The newspaper reported that the youths walked in and out of the
rat-infested warehouse in plain view of sanitation workers. Said
Turso: ``The sanitation workers' job at that location is to report
and then to go out on assignment. It's not to be a security
officer.''
   Asked about the Department's police force, he said it did not
have patrols regularly assigned to the warehouse. But on the basis
of the report, Turso said, ``We've asked the supervisor to take a
look ... to see if there are people there and to encourage them to
leave.''
   Outreach groups estimate that 20,000 young people roam the
streets every year, and 80 percent to 90 percent of them live by
prostitution, the paper said.

   A rare Florida mastiff bat, the first
one seen in the state in a decade, was found near death on an
office balcony but has recovered and escaped to the wild, a
biologist said.
   Wildlife biologist Frank Mazzotti said, however, the offspring
the round-eared brown bat bore on Labor Day died at birth.
   ``I don't think the death of the (baby bat) changes the
significance of what has happened,'' Mazzotti said. ``Not only is
the bat still in south Florida, but you have a reproductive
population.''
   Mazzotti and fellow bat hunter Mark Robson had been scouring
Florida since June trying to determine if the species still
survived in the state. They had alerted residents to watch out for
the bat.
   On Aug. 30, the bat was found by an office worker on the
tenth-floor balcony of the Turbana Corp. headquarters here.
   The worker took it inside and gave it the nickname of P.L.,
which she declined to explain. She called a veterinarian, who took
the bat.
   A routine X-ray Friday found the bat was pregnant. The bat was
in shock and dehydrated, her blood sugar and body temperature
extremely low.
   P.L. gave birth to a stillborn baby bat at the home of the
veterinarian who was nursing her back to health, Mazzotti said.
   The previously silent P.L. _ who was scheduled to be released
Monday _ became vocal and active after the birth, and soon wiggled
out of her cage to freedom.
   ``We can only hope she's OK out there somewhere,'' Robson said.

<HEAD>Zoo Closes Exhibit To Help Homesick Panda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati Zoo officials are giving giant
panda Chia Chia five days off to see if he can overcome what they
believe is homesickness.
   Chia Chia went on display Friday at the start of a three-month
stopover on his move from the London Zoo to Mexico City. But the
zoo administrators closed the exhibit the same day because the
panda was staying in his den and acting strangely.
   ``At first, we thought it was jet lag, but it's taken much
longer than we expected,'' said Jo Gipps, curator of mammals with
the London Zoo, who traveled with Chia Chia. ``Homesick is exactly
the word for what's wrong.''
   Since Friday, the 290-pound panda has emerged periodically from
his den to eat bamboo for a few minutes, then quickly retreated
from public view. When keepers tried to lock the doors to his den
to keep him in view, the panda became agitated, pacing rapidly and
bumping the walls.
   ``He's normally quite extroverted. That's why we're concerned,''
said Neil Bemment, the panda's keeper.
   ``Animals are unpredictable. We're not going to push him,'' said
Edward Maruska, executive director of the Cincinnati Zoo. He and
officials from the London Zoo decided Chia Chia needed time alone
in his new surroundings.
   Zoo officials will meet Thursday to decide if the exhibit can
reopen Friday.
   Zookeepers built a platform for the panda Monday to make him
feel like he is at his old London Zoo home, Cincinnati Zoo
spokeswoman Barbara Brady said.
   ``He's getting better. He's looking a little better _ just a
little lonely,'' Ms. Brady said Tuesday.
   The delay means about 3,400 people with tickets to see Chia Chia
this week will have to exchange their tickets or get refunds.
Through Sunday afternoon, 81,000 people had bought tickets to see
the panda before he leaves Nov. 30.
   The 16-year-old panda, captured in China at the age of 2,
arrived in Cincinnati on Friday after a seven-hour road trip from
Chicago, following a 10-hour flight from London.
   Chia Chia is scheduled to become a permanent resident of Mexico
City's Chapultepec Zoo, where it is hoped he will breed. The
Mexican zoo has had success with its panda breeding program, while
Chia Chia's breeding partner at the London Zoo died in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of American investors will lose
millions of dollars this year in what authorities on Tuesday
branded the ``fool's gold rush of 1988'' _ various swindles
offering the chance to buy gold at below-market prices.
   State securities regulators and the Council of Better Business
Bureaus warned in an ``investor alert'' that the gold schemes
represented the fastest growing fraud threat in the country. Since
the spring of 1987, they said, the number of known gold scams has
jumped from eight to 52 under investigation currently.
   Officials said last October's stock market collapse had created
a climate allowing the swindles to proliferate.
   ``Thousands of individuals fled the markets, turning their backs
on mainstream investments,'' James C. Meyer, director of the
Tennessee Division of Securities, told a news conference. ``The
result: a huge pool of potential, cash-rich victims ripe for
exploitation by the promoters of exotic investment swindles.''
   Meyer, who is president of the North American Securities
Administrators Association representing 50 state securities
offices, estimated that tens of thousands of Americans nationwide
would lose $250 million in the bogus gold deals this year.
   The typical ``dirt pile'' swindle works this way:
   A high-pressure salesman calls from a boiler-room telephone
operation, offering to sell 100 tons of dirt for $5,000. The con
artist guarantees that the dirt pile will yield at least 20 ounces
of gold, an effective price of $250 an ounce, far cheaper than the
current spot market gold price of $430 an ounce.
   ``The problem is the gold doesn't exist beyond microscopic,
economically unrecoverable levels,'' Meyer said. He said
investigators have found that many of the mine sites contain less
gold than can be found in sea water.
   ``The mine is nothing more than a Godforsaken patch of desert
scrubland,'' he said. ``These deals are a rip-off from the word
go.''
   James H. McIlhenny, president of the Council of Better Business
Bureaus, said virtually all the swindlers operated by telephone,
calling people in other states, thus avoiding detection by local
authorities.
   ``These swindlers are skilled. They sweet talk you, they
guarantee you big profits in a short time,'' he said. ``Their
victims are from all stations of life from unsophisticated elderly
persons to professionals who think they understand the risks of
investing.''
   In one case, officials said 2,000 investors were bilked out of
$20 million by a former California furniture salesman selling off a
New Mexico mine site which he claimed would generate almost $100
million in gold sales per year. The salesman was convicted last
month in a New Mexico court of 12 felony counts.
   In another case, investigators said that a Wyoming inmate
already jailed on a fraud charge used prison telephones to persuade
investors in Minnesota and Wyoming to pay an average of $6,250 each
for worthless dirt in an inactive Utah mine. When he was caught the
second time, prison authorities moved him to solitary confinement.
   ``Why people will commit their life savings over the phone, when
they wouldn't think of buying a car or house sight unseen, is a
continuing and troubling mystery to those of us whose job it is to
promote investor protection,'' Meyer said.
   Officials urged consumers to hang up on high-pressure telephone
sales tactics. They said investors also should not be swayed by
official-looking mineral-content analyses, known as assays, because
even legitimate testing labs can be duped by a dirt sample that has
been ``salted'' or taken from a different mine site.
   They also said investors should beware of vague promises on when
the gold will be delivered. The ``dirt pile'' con artists normally
say delivery will take from one to three years, long enough for the
swindler to fleece the maximum number of investors possible and
then move on to a new type of investment fraud.

<TEXT>
   South American governments have begun to act
decisively to curb narcotics trafficking, but Andean coca
production continues to grow, as reflected by a bumper crop this
year, the State Department reported Tuesday.
   The department's mid-year update on the administration's
international narcotics control strategy said the January-June
period was characterized by a mix of progress and some frustration.
   On the negative side, the report said there has been ``a lack of
progress in reducing the steadily growing Andean coca crop.''
   But the report praised the Bolivian government for exceeding its
eradication targets and Peru for its commitment to test herbicides
for use against coca.
   Colombia also was praised for its decision to use military
forces against drug traffickers.
   The report said the U.S. program to reduce coca production by 50
per cent in five years is working. The strategy calls for a program
of eradication, enforcement, development assistance, public
diplomacy and international cooperation.
   ``During the past six months, recognition by Latin American
governments of the urgent need to address the Andean coca problem
has grown significantly,'' the report said.
   ``Not only is concern addressed in leaders' public statements,
but Latin American governments have begun to act, and act
decisively. With U.S. experts predicting our nation's cocaine use
levels may have peaked, there is genuine concern in Latin America
and elsewhere about where new cocaine markets will open as
traffickers seek outlets for the Andes' bumber crop.''
   The report said Andean governments are taking steps on their own
to deal with their narcotics challenges.
   ``While the U.S. continues to play a major role in assisting
Bolivia, Colombia and Peru in eradication and enforcement, these
nations have launched important suppression operations separately
and together,'' the report said.
   It noted that Latin American enforcement organizations,
operating together this summer, made 1,200 arrests and seized a
substantial amount of illicit drugs, proving that regional
approaches to drug enforcement are more effective than single
country approaches.

<TEXT>
   An explosion that may have been caused by
a welder's torch ripped through a Greek oil tanker on Tuesday,
splitting the vessel in half and leaving seven people dead and 16
injured, officials said.
   In addition to the ship's 28-member crew, about 25 workers were
on board the green-and-white vessel for cleaning and maintenance
work, officials said.
   Many of those injured suffered severe burns. The force of the
explosion also shattered windows in stores and offices around
Perama.
   Harbor authorities in the industrial port 10 miles west of
Athens ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack.
   Instead, they theorized the explosion on board the 86,000-ton
Anangel Greatness may have been caused by gas fumes left in the
vessel's empty tanks.
   Investigators speculate welders working on the ship during
routine maintenance and cleaning may have ignited the 10:15 a.m.
blast.
   The explosion came less than two months after Arab terrorists
launched a gun-and-grenade attack aboard the City of Poros cruise
ship as it returned from a one-day Greek island hopping tour. Nine
people were killed and more than 80 others were injured in that
assault.
   ``We felt a series of sudden blinding explosions that threw us
to different parts of the ship,'' said Evangelos Polychronakis, 38,
who was working aboard the tanker at the time of the blast.
   ``As the deck blew up, large chunks of metal went hurtling into
the air. I tried to get out from inside one of the tanks I was
working in and then jumped into the sea,'' he said.
   ``When the explosion occurred I was at the bottom of one of the
tanks,'' said Andreas Varisis, 27. ``Sea water gushed into the ship
as it ripped apart and I rose with it inside the tank, trying
deperately to find some way out.''
   The skipper of the Anangel, Capt. Anastasios Theocharis, said
the vessel had been certified free of gas before it sailed into
Perama for repairs Monday.
   Merchant Marine Ministry officials said the ship carried
documents showing all gas had been removed.
   ``I was in the control room at the stern when I heard a
tremendous noise and everything clattered to the deck,'' Theocharis
said.
   Harbor authorities identified two of the dead as Theodosis
Vorisis and Aristides Daskalakis. Fragments of what appeared to be
five other bodies were also found, said a Perama police officer who
demanded anonymity.
   ``People were tossed all over the place. There were dismembered
bodies landing on the deck of another tanker berthed next to this
one,'' said Costas Sakaros, a metalworkers' union official.
   The force of the explosion also shattered windows in stores and
offices around Perama.

<TEXT>
   A high school science teacher with a mock
Space Lab in his classroom to help students learn about space
travel has been selected winner of the third Christa McAuliffe
Award for Aerospace Education.
   John Barainca, a teacher at Salt Lake City's Brighton High
School, will be presented the award by the Air Force Association on
Sept. 19 in Arlington, Va. The award is named for Christa
McAuliffe, the teacher killed in the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   The Air Force Association selected Barainca, a teacher for 16
years, from more than 1,000 national candidates. He was to be
honored locally at a dinner Tuesday night.
   Barainca was one of two Utah teachers selected as the state's
candidates for NASA's Teacher in Space program _ the program that
ultimately selected McAuliffe for the ill-fated space shuttle
launch in which she and six astronauts died on Jan. 28, 1986.
   At 52, Barainca said he sees his own chances of space travel
waning, but ``I may get into space through these kids.''
   To illustrate his lessons, he uses a Star Lab to dramatize life
in space. Students shut themselves inside the mock spacecraft that
occupies one corner of the classroom and spend up to five days
there re-enacting a space mission.
   ``He teaches in a way that is off the path of other teachers.
It's off the path of textbooks and into actual experience,'' said
Pete Fesler, one of Barainca's students.
   The award's previous winners were a high school teacher from
Fort Wayne, Ind., and an elementary school teacher from Portland,
Ore.

   Lee Roy Young received his badge and
commission Tuesday as the first black Texas Ranger, an achievement
he had dreamed of since he was a boy.
   Young, 41, said his becoming the first black Ranger in the
group's 165-year history ``should serve as an indication to other
minorities and other people you can have any type of dream ... and
it can become possible for you one day.''
   Young spoke at a news conference after the ceremony conducted by
Col. Joe Milner, director of the Department of Public Safety.
   Young, a 14-year veteran of the department, was most recently
stationed in San Antonio as an investigator with the criminal
intelligence service. He will be stationed in Garland as a Ranger.
   ``I, as a young boy growing up in Southwest Texas, read about
the Rangers and saw movies and things of that type, and decided I
would like to aspire to become a Ranger one day myself,'' said
Young, who was born in Del Rio.
   Young was among 37 people receiving promotions in the ceremony
at the safety department headquarters. His wife, Mary; children,
Anthony and Kristen; and other family members watched him receive
his badge.
   A Department of Public Safety officer must have at least eight
years of law enforcement experience to be eligible to be a Ranger,
and at least 60 hours of college or the equivalent education.
Appointments are made on the basis of a competitive examination and
oral interviews.
   Rangers are charged specifically with four duties: protection of
life and property by enforcing state criminal statutes; suppressing
riots and insurrections; investigating major crimes; and
apprehending fugitives.
   The safety department has been hit by charges of racial
discrimination in recent years. A black state trooper from Houston
voiced disappointment last year when he was not selected for the
Rangers. And the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People has charged that black officers have been
discriminated against.
   Asked whether he believes there is racism in the agency, Young
said, ``That's part of our society, and of course we try to do away
with it, but it's part of our society and we have to learn to
contend with that.''

<HEAD>NY No Longer Only State To Prohibit Over-The-Counter Eyeglass
Sales</HEAD>

   New York will no longer be the only state in
the nation to prohibit the sale of non-prescription magnifying
eyeglasses under a bill Gov. Mario Cuomo signed into law Tuesday.
   Sponsors said the measure will slash the cost of glasses for
reading or magnifying objects at close range.
   Lobbying on the bill, which takes effect in 90 days, had been
intense in the Legislature, with consumer groups and eyeglass
manufacturers pushing for its approval and some state optometrists
and opticians advocating its defeat.
   Both houses of the Legislature approved it last month.
   Obtaining magnifying eyeglasses with a prescription costs $60 to
$120, according to the American Association of Retired Persons.
Buying them without a doctor's involvement cuts the price to $12 to
$15, said the sponsors, state Sen. Joseph Bruno and Assemblyman
Richard Gottfried.
   New York became the last state in the country to prohibit
over-the-counter sales of the glasses in June, when Rhode Island
Gov. Edward DiPrete legalized sales in his state.
   ``This clearly shows the absurdity of New York's position and
why it should change,'' said Morton Getman, a lobbyist on behalf of
the nation's largest manufacturer of magnifying glasses,
Magnivision of Miami. ``It's now 49 to 1.''
   New York state's Medical Society opposed the measure for years
but this year said it would go along with the bill after it was
amended to require that all reading glasses carry a tag advising
people to get their eyes checked regularly.
   Jan Dorman, executive director of the Albany-based state
Optometric Association, said approval of the bill would represent
``bad public health policy.''
   Dorman said magnifying glasses can mask serious medical
conditions including glaucoma and detached retinas, problems that
health care professionals are trained to detect.

   Presidential candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis will face each other in two televised debates and their
running mates will square off once, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul
Brountas said Tuesday.
   After weeks of negotiations, the Dukakis campaign said it is
willing to accept the Bush campaign's offer of two presidential
debates _ one fewer than Dukakis had sought _ as well as one
encounter between vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle and Lloyd
Bentsen.
   ``I've told them we could live with two presidential and one
vice presidential debates,'' said Brountas, who accompanied
Democrat Dukakis on a campaign trip to Illinois.
   ``We still have not reached an agreement on timing and format,''
he added.
   Brountas and Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III, who
talked by telephone for about 25 minutes Tuesday, planned to
continue their talks on Wednesday, said Mark Goodin, a spokesman
for Bush.
   The two sides hope to reach a final agreement on dates for the
debates and on whether the format will be open or on specific
topics.
   Baker has said that GOP nominee Bush is willing to debate
Dukakis any time between Sept. 25 and Oct. 17.
   The Dukakis campaign wanted the first debate to be on foreign
policy and national security issues, but that was rejected by the
Bush campaign last week.
   On Tuesday, while on a campaign stop in Portland, Ore., Bush
said of Dukakis, ``I have respect for him as a debater.'' He said
Dukakis was ``far better than I am'' in debating.

   Police and several neighbors found themselves
in an impromptu pig roundup when about five runaway porkers took to
the streets near here.
   ``We were sitting on our porch, quietly drinking coffee when my
wife said, `Will you look at that,''' said Drew Schwartz.
   ``There were four or five pigs walking down the middle of the
road, shoulder-to-shoulder. It was like they were out for a morning
stroll,'' he said. ``I ran out in the street because there were
cars coming. I got them out of the road.''
   Schwartz added, ``We have a bad curve right there where cars
come around at 40 miles an hour and if they would have hit a pig,
pork chops everywhere.''
   He went to his neighbor's door in Conewago Township, which is in
southeastern Pennsylvania, to ask the man if he knew who owned the
pigs. The pigs went to a garage.
   His wife called police, who asked neighbors if they knew who
owned the pigs. Schwartz ran around to the back of another
neighbor's backyard when he discovered another five pigs.
   ``It was crazy. ... We found a barn door open and a gate inside.
...I don't know if the pigs belonged there or not but it was a good
place to put them. That guy might come home and find ten new
pigs,'' he said.
   Police said the owner is David Rhen, but the officer on duty
could not say if that was the same man who owns the barn the pigs
were left in. Rhen could not be reached for comment.
   ``If you find out that it's not his pigs, give him my number,''
Schwartz said. ``I want some ham.''

<HEAD>Judge Allows Evidence of Prior Near-Drowning in Court-Martial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Testimony about a near-drowning last year
involving a Navy swimming instructor will be allowed in the
instructor's court-martial for his role in the death of a recruit
in March, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, 28, of Tempe, Ariz., is
charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to
commit battery in the March 2 drowing of Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   Combe is accused of holding Mirecki's head under water after
Pensacola Naval Air Station instructors forced the panic-stricken
recruit back into a swimming pool when he climbed out and shouted
he wanted to quit the voluntary training.
   Opening arguments in the court-martial were scheduled to begin
later Tuesday. In pre-trial motions, the military judge, Cmdr.
Newell D. Krogmann, rejected a defense motion to bar testimony and
prohibit the introduction of an accident report about the Sept. 30
near-drowning of Christopher Coccitti, a Navy reservist from
Jacksonville.
   Coccitti testified last week in the court-martial of the former
officer in charge of the swimming school that he blacked out under
water while Combe had him in a head hold. Coccitti had been
participating in the ``sharks and daisies'' drill, the same
exercise being conducted when Mirecki died.
   An attorney for Combe, Robert Heath Jr., argued that Coccitti's
testimony was irrelevant because the earlier emergency was
unrelated to Mirecki's death.
   The lead prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Larry Wynne, contended the
information is pertinent because it showed Combe had a ``cavalier
attitude'' toward students who passed out in the swimming pool.
   It was an occurrence known as ``smurfing'' because the skin of
victims would turn blue like that of ``Smurf'' cartoon characters,
former students have said.
   Mirecki, who had a phobia about being dragged under water,
drowned after suffering a fear-induced heart attack, a pathologist
testified last week in the court-martial of Lt. Thomas A. Torchia,
former officer in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School.
   Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill., was acquitted Thursday on both
of two dereliction-of-duty charges. He is not scheduled to testify
in Combe's court-martial, but four other instructors who received
non-judicial punishment are listed as defense witnesses.
   The prosecution granted them immunity after defense lawyers said
their testimony was vital to Combe's case.

<HEAD>Forest Service May Raid Replanting Fund To Pay For Firefighting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With the western forest fire season just
entering its peak month, the U.S. Forest Service has already spent
$190 million battling this summer's blazes and may be forced again
to raid a key reforestation trust fund to pay for the effort.
   The agency tapped the same account to help pay last year's
firefighting costs. While Congress traditionally has bailed out the
Forest Service, an Oregon lawmaker said Tuesday the ``smoke and
mirrors'' budgeting could eventually jeopardize the replanting of
national forest lands that have been logged.
   ``It's time the Forest Service rises above the politics of the
Office of Management and the Budget in trying to create the
illusion that the deficit is being held down,'' said Democratic
Rep. Peter A. DeFazio.
   DeFazio said the Forest Service has known for six months that
western forest were tinder dry, but continued to use a
``short-sighted'' budget approach that requires Congress to step in
and appropriate additional funds.
   ``They continue to budget in a penny-wise and pound-foolish
way,'' said DeFazio.
   A Forest Service budget official said no decision has yet been
made on whether to borrow from the so-called Knutsen-Vanderberg
trust fund. ``It's a possibility,'' said Robert Gordon, an
assistant director of the agency.
   Money from the fund comes from fees timber operators pay when
they log national forests and is earmarked for reforestation
projects.
   Traditionally, the Forest Service's budget request includes a
``token'' amount for fighting fires. The agency will borrow from a
trust fund if more money is needed and then ask Congress for
additional funding to repay what was borrowed.
   An interior appropriations bill pending in Congress includes
$125 million for firefighting and DeFazio said that most of it will
be used to repay the trust fund from last year's borrowings.
   ``This whole things is incredibly frustrating,'' said DeFazio.
``They (the Forest Service) admit it's not in their best interest,
but they keep doing it.''
   Last year, the Forest Service spent $265 million to fight fires
that swept across about 800,000 acres in the Pacific Northwest and
California. Most of those blazes were in late August and September.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle says Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is no different from
previous Kremlin leaders and his system of reforms, known as
``perestroika,'' is ``nothing more than refined Stalinism.''
   The Indiana senator, in an interview published Tuesday in The
Washington Post, said Gorbachev is ``new ... he has a different
approach to things, and his mannerisms and style are unfortunately
pleasing to the West. ... unfortunately because I don't think, from
an ideological point of view, he's any different from (Leonid)
Brezhnev or anybody else.''
   Quayle said perestroika is ``nothing more than refined
Stalinism. Kick their people out and bring your people in. That's
his reorganizing. It's not changing the system.''
   GOP presidential nominee George Bush said last month that he was
pleased with changes in the Soviet Union, but he cautioned against
complacency, saying, ``We'd better not let our guard down.''
   Earlier this summer, the vice president had called the Soviet
reforms ``revolutionary,'' but also said ``the cold war is not
over.''
   Quayle described Soviet efforts toward ``glasnost,'' or
openness, as ``something different'' that might prove to be a
positive sign, similar to the signing of the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces Treaty by President Reagan and Gorbachev last
December.
   Quayle said the true test would be the Soviet leader's dealings
with dissent in Eastern Europe, especially current problems in
Poland.
   ``The bottom line is that Gorbachev wants trade and credits from
the West ... to help his economy out, and we should not give it to
him in a casual, easy way,'' he said.
   Bush said this summer that some reforms proposed by Gorbachev
``would truly, if implemented, be revolutionary and should the
reforms ... be put into practice it would represent historic
change.''
   But Bush added, ``We've got to remember that the cold war is not
over. We must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change,
but at the same time, as one pundit titled his column, be prepared
for `the protracted conflict.'''

   Catholic Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of
Cincinnati returned to work Tuesday for the first time since he
suffered a ruptured brain artery in July.
   Pilarczyk, 54, who has governed the Archdiocese of Cincinnati
since 1982, spent a half day in his office, said the Rev. Ted
Kosse, spokesman for the archdiocese. It was his first day of
official duty since he suffered the aneurysm July 23 while
vacationing in Gatlinburg, Tenn.
   The archbishop underwent surgery July 25 at Cincinnati's Good
Samaritan Hospital, where neurosurgeons sealed the ruptured artery
and rerouted the brain's blood supply to avoid a possible fatal
recurrence. He was released from the hospital Aug. 11.
   An aneurysm is a sac formed in the wall of an artery and is
blamed on a congenital weakness in the arterial wall.
   Pilarczyk refused interviews Tuesday, but is to hold a news
conference Thursday.
   His doctors said Pilarczyk gave them approval to be the first in
Cincinnati to use an experimental drug, which doctors said may have
helped save his life by possibly preventing arterial spasms that
can occur even after surgery. The drug, called nicardipine, relaxes
the arterial wall and prevents spasms, doctors said.
   Pilarczyk is spiritual leader of about 550,000 Catholics in the
19-county archdiocese in southwestern Ohio. Auxiliary Bishop James
Garland governed the archdiocese during Pilarczyk's absence.

<HEAD>Some Students Not Benefitting From Spread of Schoolroom Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computers are moving rapidly into American
classrooms, but too many minority and limited-English students
aren't reaping the benefits of the new educational technology, an
advisory group said in a report released Tuesday.
   U.S. schools have acquired nearly 2 million computers during
this decade, said the report by the Office of Technology
Assessment, a non-partisan agency that advises Congress on
technological matters.
   Whereas fewer than one school in five had a computer in 1981,
now all but 5 percent of schools have at least one, the agency said
in a 246-page report titled ``Power On! New Tools For Teaching and
Learning.''
   ``It has been a very important, useful investment,'' said report
director Linda Roberts. ``When students are using computers,
teachers are trained and the software is appropriate, there really
are advances in learning.''
   On the downside, the report found that the total number of
computers is equal to one for every 30 students; average access is
one hour a week, and it would cost $4 billion to reduce the
student-computer ratio to 3:1.
   ``In general, classrooms today resemble their ancestors of 50
and 100 years ago much more closely than than they do today's
assembly plants, scientific laboratories and operating rooms,'' it
said. ``Most schools do not have enough computers to make them a
central tool of instruction.''
   Exacerbating the access problem is the fact that computers tend
to be concentrated in affluent schools with smaller student bodies,
the report said.
   The agency report said black students, who generally attend
larger schools, have less computer access than white students and
``students with limited English proficiency have the lowest access
of all.''
   Other problems cited in the report include inadequate teacher
training, mediocre educational software and ``the absence of a
coordinated federal policy, limited and short-term funding, erratic
political support and disorganized research and development efforts
across agencies...''
   Only one-third of teachers have even 10 hours of computer
training, the agency found, and little of it focused on how to
teach with computers.
   And while there are 10,000 educational software products
available, OTA said, ``their quality could be much better...
Economic risks in the marketplace lead software publishers to play
it safe.''
   At the current rate of investment, Roberts said, ``the nation
can expect continuing experimentation in some schools, steady but
slow improvement in software and spotty access to the technology by
students.''
   Speeding up the process will require greater efforts by the
federal, state and local governments as well as the private sector,
she said.
   On the federal level, OTA recommended boosting the current $240
million investment in learning technology research, including
development of software; and encouraging school districts to buy
more hardware and software with money from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2,
federal programs for disadvantaged students and general education
spending by states.
   The agency's report was requested by the House Education and
Labor Committee. Committee chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.,
said in comments accompanying the report that increased federal
support for computers in the schools ``would be a good public
policy and a wise investment for the future.''
   Rep. Matthew Martinez, D-Calif., chairman of the panel's
subcommittee on employment opportunities, said minority and
limited-English students must be ensured equal access to computers.
   ``Access to these technologies is spelled M-O-N-E-Y, but the
schools our minority students attend are often overcrowded and
underfunded,'' Martinez said. ``Technology can narrow or widen
these differences. If we do not act... the classroom of tomorrow
may always be left for manana in many of our schools.''

<TEXT>
   Leonid I. Brezhnev's friend and law enforcement
chief, Nikolai A. Shchelokov, accepted lavish gifts and huge
bribes, then killed himself when his deeds were discovered, the
government charged Tuesday.
   The allegations about the former Interior Minister, who died in
disgrace in 1984, came on the second day of the bribery-corruption
trial of Yuri M. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law. Churbanov served
as Shchelokov's top deputy.
   The charges included the first official confirmation of rumors
that the 73-year-old Shchelokov committed suicide when he felt the
law closing in.
   Churbanov and eight former Interior Ministry officials from the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan are on trial before a Soviet
Supreme Court military tribunal. Their highly publicized trial is
being used to further leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive against
corruption and cronyism.
   The trial also is seen as a further attempt to discredit
President Brezhnev, whose 1964-1982 regime is routinely referred to
by Gorbachev and his top officials as a period of stagnation in the
Soviet Union.
   A 1,500-page indictment against the accused charges Churbanov
with accepting the equivalent of $1 million in bribes, and its
passages about Shchelokov, read aloud by a clerk to a full and
silent courtroom, gave the most detailed account yet of corruption
in the tops ranks of the Brezhnev regime.
   Recent newspaper reports have said Shchelokov, the Interior
Ministry chief for 16 years, lined his pockets with 700,000 rubles
($1.1 million) in state funds and lived an extravagant lifestyle,
giving foreign luxury cars to his children and buying furs and
crystal chandeliers for himself and his family.
   ``He wanted good, dry wines,'' the indictment said, and some of
the defendants in the Moscow bribery-corruption trial allegedly
obliged him.
   Six times a year, food shipments from Uzbekistan arrived at a
Moscow airport and were taken to Shchelekov's country home outside
the capital, the indictment said. The shipments contained cognac,
tomatoes, melons, apricots and other fruits and vegetables
unobtainable in Moscow most of the year.
   When he received gifts he liked, the account said, the minister,
who was in charge of the Soviet Union's uniformed police force,
always politely accepted them and said, ``I thank you.''
   Sometimes, however, he refused to take things he didn't want.
   According to the indictment, Shchelokov once was taken to a
factory in Uzbekistan, the center of the crime ring being exposed
in the Moscow trial, and was offered clothes and other products
made there.
   He reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of jewelry
for his wife. On another occasion, he received three pearls, each
worth 3,300 rubles ($5,300), the indictment said.
   The court documents said boxes of money were left on
Shchelokov's desk. One of the nine defendants, former Uzbek
Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev, was quoted in the indictment as
acknowledging that he gave his Moscow-based superior boss 105,000
rubles ($170,000), and neckties, gold jewelry, precious stones and
other valuables.
   Yakhyaev explained the payments by saying they were necessary to
``win protection in the successful struggle against crime in the
republic,'' the indictment said. Of Shchelokov, Yakhyaev said: ``He
was a capable person, a good speaker and an influential man.''
   Shchelokov was one of the closest confidants of Brezhnev, who
was Communist Party chief from 1964 until his death in December
1982. Under his tenure, the Interior Ministry became notorious for
corruption, and he was fired by Brezhnev's successor, former KGB
chief Yuri V. Andropov.
   The indictment referred to Shchelokov and two former Uzbek
police officials, and said: ``Their involvement in the crimes
committed was proved in full measure. However, fearing retribution
for what they had done, they committed suicide. In view of this,
the cases against them were abated.''
   The trial in the neo-classic Supreme Court building in central
Moscow entered its second day with one defendant absent because of
a heart ailment.
   The judge rejected a defense request to halt the proceedings,
which are giving Soviets a rare glimpse into the high living
enjoyed by some Kremlin officials.
   Two other defendants were treated by a doctor in the courtroom,
and the military tribunal's chief judge, Army Maj. Gen. Mikhail
Marov, called a 50-minute recess so Yakhyaev, who looked haggard
and dazed, could have his blood pressure checked by a doctor clad
in a white smock.
   The principal defendant in the case, Churbanov, who married
Brezhnev's daughter Galina, could receive the death penalty if
convicted on charges he accepted more than $1 million in cash
bribes and gifts, as well as regular supplies of wine, cognac,
pomegranates, grapes and other hard-to-find fruit flown to him via
the Soviet airline Aeroflot from Uzbekistan.

<HEAD>Bakker Given Until Thursday For $3 Million Down Payment On PTL</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker was given a
two-day extension Tuesday to come up with a $3 million down payment
as the first step of his $172 million proposal to buy the
television ministry's assets.
   Bakker and PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said they
were still working out details of a contract for Bakker to buy
assets of the ministry he gave up after a sex and money scandal
last year.
   The two men spoke with reporters after a one-hour meeting at the
executive offices of Heritage USA, the entertainment, retail and
hotel complex the ministry must sell as part of a Chapter 11
reorganization.
   ``The attorneys are still working on it and we hope to have
something that's agreeable to everyone by tomorrow,'' said Benton,
who had said on Friday that if the $3 million wasn't available by
Tuesday he would be forced to consider other bids.
   Bakker said he was about ``$100,000 short'' of the $3 million in
cash and letters of credit. Benton said he was convinced Bakker
would have the entire amount and gave him until Thursday to deliver
it.
   ``I'm thoroughly satisfied the $3 million line of credit, or its
equivalent, will be there,'' said Benton, who explained that
Bakker's offer had been raised from $165 million to $172 million.
   Benton had asked Bakker for the $3 million as a show of good
faith in his plan to buy the Heritage USA Christian theme park, a
satellite network and undeveloped property near the Fort Mill-based
ministry.
   Bakker, who left PTL in March 1987 after admitting to a sexual
encounter with onetime church secretary Jessica Hahn, leads in the
bidding to buy the assets of PTL.
   Benton has given Bakker until Friday to present him with details
of a financial deal between the former TV evangelist and an
unidentified group of Greek businessmen. Benton said he will
recommend a buyer to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds on
Saturday.
   The trustee said he has ``four or five'' other bids for PTL
besides the one by Bakker and a standing offer of $113 million by
Canadian real estate executive Peter Thomas.
   Bakker's offer may not be the only one presented to Reynolds on
Saturday, Benton said, adding that any plan would be subject to a
court hearing before final approval.
   On Friday, Benton had said he was ``very, very skeptical'' about
whether Bakker could complete the deal. He said Tuesday ``a lot has
happened over the weekend'' to change his thinking.
   He dismissed suggestions that Bakker was being given a lot of
flexibility in meeting court-mandated deadlines.
   ``The judge is the one who sets the deadlines,'' Benton said.
``He set it for Saturday. By Friday, he (Bakker) has to convince
everyone that he has $77 million (as part of the purchase price).''
   After a jubilant Bakker left Heritage USA on Tuesday, his wife,
Tammy Faye Bakker, paid a surprise visit.
   ``I'm so excited ... I feel like I've got a butterfly in my
tummy,'' she told reporters.
   Mrs. Bakker said she is confident her husband will be successful
in getting the ministry back and that they will get the support of
the public.
   ``I can look you in the eye and say we didn't misuse PTL or
Heritage USA,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bakker, a gospel singer, said she already was rehearsing
her opening song for the day she and her husband again have a
television program.
   ``It will be `The Sun Will Shine Again,''' she said.

   Police Tuesday recaptured an Arkansas
prison escapee who was hiding out in a Salvation Army shelter only
a block from police headquarters.
   Acting on a tip from an informant, police said they found James
Ray Renton, 50, asleep in a crowded dormitory room. Police said
they awakened and arrested him and seized a sawed-off shotgun, a
12-gauge pistol and several knives.
   Arkansas authorities ``think he is one of the probably most
dangerous men we'll ever come in contact with,'' said senior Sgt.
David Neely, one of those who arrested Renton.
   ``This guy said that he would kill cops. He's killed a cop
before. He hates cops,'' added police spokesman C.F. Adams.
   Renton was one of four inmates who escaped July 11 from a
maximum security prison at Tucker, Ark. The others have been
captured.
   Renton had been sentenced to life in prison without parole for
the abduction and slaying of Springdale policeman John T. Hussey,
22, in December 1975. From April 1976 until his arrest in May 1977,
Renton was on the FBI's list of the 10 most wanted. He recently was
placed on the U.S. Marshal Service's 15 most wanted list.
   Arkansas prison spokesman David White said extradition
proceedings were beginning immediately.
   Neely said a segment about Renton was broadcast recently on the
``America's Most Wanted'' television program. Although he had
shaved off a mustache and gotten a close haircut, an informant
recognized Renton at the Salvation Army shelter and contacted
police, Neely said.
   Renton ``said he had seen himself on `America's Most Wanted' and
he needed to change his appearance,'' Neely said. He said the
unidentified informant may have recognized Renton by several
tattoos.
   After receiving the tip, officers went to the Salvation Army
shelter, one block west of police headquarters. Four sealed off the
building's exits while five went inside.
   The officers moved quietly through the men's dormitory room,
which Neely said had 120 to 130 beds, which were mostly full.
   ``It's dimly lit. But we went from bunk to bunk until we found
somebody that matched the description as best we could tell,''
Neely said. ``We encircled that bunk. I tapped him on the
shoulder.''
   Renton offered no resistance, the sergeant said.

<HEAD>Karnes Says He Didn't Mean His Remark About Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By J.L. SCHMIDT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Karnes drew boos from the crowd
and criticism from opponent Bob Kerrey when he told a crowds at the
Nebraska State Fair that ``We need fewer farmers at this point in
time.''
   ``I was perplexed when I heard all of the booing,'' Karnes said
Monday after the first of eight debates between himself and the
former one-term Democratic governor. ``I obviously don't support
that statement. We should be able to encourage people to look at
agriculture as an investment.''
   Karnes was speaking about increased agricultural technology when
he made the remark, to a standing-room-only audience of more than
2,000 people. He said later that he had misspoken and attributed it
to ``the heat of the debate.'' Karnes said what he meant by the
statement was that technology has allowed fewer farmers to do more
work.
   Kerrey, after the debate, called Karnes' statement ``a mistake''
in political judgment.
   ``It is to assume again that we've got to have fewer farmers. It
is to believe that there is nothing we can do to provide support
for the farmers we have now,'' Kerrey said.
   Another Karnes slip brought applause and cheers from Kerrey
supporters as the Republican rebutted Kerrey's criticism of a
diesel fuel tax amendment he sponsored.
   ``Mr. Kerrey, once you get to the United States Senate you'll
know the importance of putting people on record,'' Karnes said.
   Karnes spokesman Brent Bahler said of the candidate's verbal
fumbles: ``I'll be blunt. He is not as articulate as I would like
him to be.
   ``But people understand Senator Karnes is not a smooth talker
like his challenger. Sometimes his words get jumbled. But do we
want a senator that is a smooth talker or one who knows his stuff?''
   Karnes, who was appointed to the Senate after the death of
Democrat Edward Zorinsky, is seeking election to his first full
term.

<HEAD>Khomeini Letter Brings Post-War Power Struggle In Open</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sent Iran's
prime minister a letter Tuesday criticizing him for trying to
resign, and analysts said long-submerged political differences in
Tehran are coming to the surface.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi attempted to resign Monday to
avoid what he feared would be a no-confidence vote in parliament
over the post-Persian Gulf war reconstruction policies he advocates.
   Musavi's resignation was rejected by President Ali Khamenei
hours before parliament was due to vote, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency said in a report monitored from Nicosia.
   ``If you decided to resign, it would have been better if you had
at least informed me or other high ranking officials,'' Tehran
Radio said, quoting Khomeini's letter.
   ``At a time when Muslims donate their sons to help Islam, this
is not the right time for complaining and resigning,'' the letter
said, in a reference to the 1 million casualties suffered in the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Both sides accepted a U.N.-sponsered
cease-fire on Aug. 20.
   The fact that parliament might exercise its right to reject
Cabinet ministers was not sufficient cause for resigning,
Khomeini's letter said.
   Khomeini, adopting a fatherly tone at the end of the letter,
said he liked Musavi and suggested they meet soon so he could
remind the prime minister of the problems Iran still faces.
   Western analysts who specialize in Iranian affairs said Khomeini
may have intervened to keep Musavi's government in office a few
more months to prevent a rupture right after the cease-fire with
Iraq.
   They noted that Khomeini rescued Musavi from a no-confidence
vote in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, four years ago to avoid
a split while the war was at its height.
   Word of the resignation offer first surfaced when Tehran's
Jomhuri Eslami, a publication of Iran's Islamic clerics that Musavi
once edited, printed his lengthy letter to Khamenei.
   Musavi, prime minister since 1981, said his planning and budget
minister, Massoud Zanjani, resigned Saturday and that the future of
his energy, construction and trade ministers were in doubt.
   Musavi said he believed ``five to eight of his ministers will
not get the vote of confidence needed for them to continue their
responsibilities.''
   He did not identify all eight, who comprise more than one-third
of the 21-man cabinet he named July 21 after parliamentary
elections in April and May.
   He acknowledged ``differences of opinion with regard to domestic
and international policies,'' but said they must not ``detract from
the need for unity in confronting conspiracies.''
   Shavan Chubin, a Geneva-based specialist on Iranian affairs,
said Khomeini, ``if he wants to avoid change at this critical time,
could simply tell the Majlis to vote for Musavi _ for now.'' That
meeting, intially set for Tuesday, was rescheduled for Sunday.
   Chubin said in a telephone interview that ``the passing of the
war was bound to reopen old schisms. There were bound to be
difficulties as Iran moved into the post-war era.
   Chubin and other analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Musavi has been at odds over post-war reconstruction and
economic development with Khamenei and Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's
military commander and powerful parliament speaker. ``The
portfolios Musavi mentioned indicate that the problem lies
primarily in the economic sector,'' Chubin said.
   Musavi has long advocated greater state control of the economy.
He was opposed by Khamenei, who has close links with the
``bazaaris,'' the wealthy merchant class, and by conservative
clerics.
   That split, which has intensified political uncertainty,
sharpened when the fighting stopped. Iran's leaders announced they
had begun planning the massive task of post-war reconstruction,
including to what extent Iran should call in foreign companies to
help it rebuild.
   ``Musavi is not keen on getting involved with foreign companies
and having Iran go into debt,'' Chubin said. ``Khamenei and
Rafsanjani take a more practical approach.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen foraged for Southern votes on Tuesday by emphasizing
education and training to help meet foreign competition _ and
chiding Republican George Bush for a late conversion to the cause.
   ``If we want to retain our position of world leadership, America
must be able to compete for world markets,'' Bentsen said. ``We
must have the best-trained, most highly motivated workforce, the
best universities and the best teachers.''
   And unlike Bush, Bentsen said in a speech at the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis has been on the education bandwagon from the start.
   ``Mike Dukakis didn't just suddenly wake up one morning and
decide he wanted to be `the education president,''' Bentsen said,
alluding to Bush's claim to the description. ``Mike Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen have accepted a lifelong commitment to education.
   ``For eight years now we've watched the Reagan-Bush
administration trash educational opportunity across this country,''
Bentsen told a rowdy student audience packed into the college
auditorium.
   Following the speech, Bentsen moved outside for a rally before
several hundred more students, including a strong-voiced contingent
for Bush and some carrying signs that read, ``Duke buster,'' and
``Avoid the Lloyd.''
   Bentsen, interrupted in his remarks, looked at that group and
said, ``I met George Bush once before,'' alluding to his defeat of
Bush in a 1970 Texas Senate race. ``And I think Quayle season is
starting early this year.''
   Bentsen said college alone does not provide all of the nation's
important education as he started his day visiting a technical
training center in the Atlanta suburb of Lawrenceville.
   Bentsen handled a soldering iron and other tools, including a
microscope, to inspect the work. Afterward, he told reporters the
federal government could do more to provide ``seed money'' to
expand technical training.
   The Reagan administration has ``put all kinds of speed bumps in
the way to achieving education,'' Bentsen said. A Democratic
administration, he said, would promote programs such as the one at
the Gwinnett Technical Institute where he attended the class with
nine women learning to make electronic circuit boards.
   Bentsen also said he personally favored a longer school year for
U.S. children, citing figures from Europe and Japan. But he said
that issue would be decided at the state and local level, not by
the federal government.
   Polls show the Republican ticket leading in both Georgia and
Virginia, but Bentsen said he considered both states within range
for the Democrats, especially since they were receiving support
from locally-elected officials.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., attended the session at Gwinnett with
Bentsen, and Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles and former Gov. Charles
Robb, now a Senate candidate, were awaiting Bentsen at the college
in Blacksburg, Va.
   ``I think we'll get those Democrats who voted for Reagan coming
back to us,'' Bentsen told reporters, adding that polls backed up
his statement. ``To the extend we can bring them back, we're going
to do it.''
   Dukakis' support of gun control laws is one of the obstacles in
that effort. Bentsen, who usually opposes such measures, said he
had not yet decided whether to support an amendment now before the
Congress.
   Bentsen said the underlying concept in the amendment of a
waiting period for handgun purchases was appealing, since it would
provide a ``cooling off period'' for people wanting a gun for
emotional reasons. It also would give officials time to determine
if the purchaser was a criminal, he said.
   However, he said he had not studied how far the amendment
extended beyond that and was withholding any endorsement.
   The Texas senator was returning to Washington for a vote
Wednesday on a bill to help the textile industry _ also an
important issue in the South where many factories have been hurt by
foreign competition.
   Bentsen planned to resume campaigning Thursday, beginning in New
York and finishing the week in California, with a stop in Iowa en
route.

   Many Hispanics contend bullfighting is an
important part of their culture, but animal welfare officials said
Tuesday they don't want any repeats of the city's first ``bloodless
bullfight.''
   Peter Poholik, executive director of the city's Commission on
Animal Care and Control, said he already has received _ and will
reject _ a request for a permit for another bullfight, on Sept. 18.
He said he was asking the mayor and City Council to move as soon as
possible to specifically ban the bloodless fights.
   Matadors in the bullfights use the traditional cape to taunt the
bull, but instead of the ``death in the afternoon'' immortalized by
author Ernest Hemingway, the bull is tagged with Velcro-tipped
darts aimed at Velcro patches glued to his back, the coup de grace
administered with a Velcro-tipped sword.
   ``It's a bullfight where they don't poke any holes in the
animal,'' Poholik said.
   Nevertheless, he believes the fights violate a city ordinance
that forbids ``torture, tortment or baiting'' of animals.
   ``The bull is not of a good temperament to begin with, and all
of the teasing gets him really enraged. ... It's just another
example of man's cruelty to animals.''
   About 1,100 people watched as three 1,000-pound bulls charged
matadors' capes, occasionally flipping one of the men, in
bullfights Saturday and Sunday.
   While Poholik initially denied bullfight promoters a permit,
Cook County Circuit Judge Albert Green ordered it granted on
grounds the confrontations were no more cruel than rodeos, which
the city allows.
   ``What do you do at a rodeo? The guy gets on the bull and kicks
it with his spurs to incite it,'' Green said Tuesday. ``Some people
consider a bullfight a ballet.''
   ``It was beautiful,'' said Bella Jonas, who attended Saturday's
fight. ``Nobody even hurt the bull, and now they want to stop
because of cruelty. It was just plain art.''
   ``All these people, they don't want the Spanish people to have
what's theirs,'' said Homer Alvarado, leader of MEDA, a charity
that helps the poor and received meat from the bulls, which were
slaughtered after the weekend fights staged and promoted by Jaass
Productions.
   ``They're discriminating against us. They have a rodeo. Why
don't they stop it?''
   But state Rep. Ben Martinez said that ``as far as I'm concerned,
I'm born in this country and it's not a sport I'm interested in.''
   Poholik says that while he is ``not all that happy about
rodeo,'' it is a recognized sporting event in the United States and
as such is allowed.
   ``We're trying to limit the long list of animal exploitation
going on,'' he said. ``How far do we let this cultural tradition
go? In Korea, they eat dogs. In Puerto Rico, cockfighting is
legal.''
   Bullfighting originated in Crete about 2,000 B.C. and was
popular for centuries among the wealthy until Pope Pius V,
concerned about numerous deaths, threatened to excommunicate
practitioners in 1567. The ban did not curb the sport's popularity
in Spain, however, and the prohibition was lifted.
   It remains popular in Spain, Portugal and Latin America. The
bloodless Velcro version has been allowed in three other U.S.
states, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
   Poholik said he plans to deny another permit to the bullfight
promoters. Alvarado says promoters will appeal that ruling.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer is backing Poholik's effort.
   ``I certainly respect the culture and traditions of the Hispanic
community,'' Sawyer said in a statement. ``But I also respect the
feelings of many Chicagoans who believe that a bullfight
constitutes cruelty to animals.''
   Poholik said that despite his effort to prevent future
bullfights, which probably will take at least a month, he was
impressed by the care of the bulls before and after the weekend
contests.
   ``I'll give the people credit for keeping the animals well,'' he
said. ``They appeared to be in excellent condition.''

   The identity of Florida's $55.2 million
lottery winner remained a mystery Tuesday, but state officials
announced one sure victor: schoolchildren.
   Florida puts 35 percent of lottery sales to education, which now
equals $350 million in the lottery's first eight months. Officials
said the total is twice as much as earlier projections.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who opposes the lottery, said Tuesday the
state broke $1 billion in sales during last week's record number of
ticket purchases, which contributed to the world's largest single
lottery jackpot.
   ``This record-breaking pace is exciting, both for the players
and public education in Florida,'' Martinez said. ``While the
lottery was never envisioned to meet all the funding needs of
education, it's good to know that the games are doing so much to
enhance our basic school program.''
   Meanwhile, lottery officials say they have heard from several
people who claim to have the winning ticket.
   The six winning numbers were picked in a drawing Saturday night,
and lottery officials determined by computer the next day that only
one ticket _ purchased by someone in Longwood in central Florida _
had the winning combination.
   A person claiming to represent Charles Hill, a school janitor in
the Panhandle town of Bristol, called the Lottery Department on
Tuesday and said Hill would come to Tallahassee Wednesday with the
winning ticket, said Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   ``We have no reason to believe that he does or that he doesn't
until he comes forward with the actual ticket and it goes through
our validation process we really don't know,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   ``We've talked to a whole bunch of people who say they have the
winning ticket,'' she said.
   At least three other people have called the department claiming
to have the winning ticket, according to Bernard Edwards, deputy
secretary of operations. Mrs. Paul said one of the callers
identified himself as a resident of Minnesota, and another caller
came from central Florida.
   ``We've had several dozen calls from folks saying `We have the
winning ticket _ what do we do?' without identifying themselves or
their city or anything else,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes.
   One unknown _ the exact amount of the prize _ was determined,
Mrs. Paul said. The jackpot's final value was put at $55.2 million
Tuesday, which breaks down into 20 annual payments of $2.7 million
before taxes. Earlier, estimates put the record jackpot at $54
million.

   The Soviet Union, the first country to put a man
in space, has helped make manned space flight routine, giving
officials confidence to televise launches and landings live and
invite foreigners to climb aboard for a ride.
   But, like the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger,
Tuesday's aborted landing of an Afghan-Soviet space crew again
pointed up the dangers of space flight.
   ``We are already used to everything going smoothly in space,''
commentator Alexander Tikhomirov told millions of Soviets in a
prime time television newscast. ``And some forget about the danger
which space research entails. And here, this once more convinces us
how complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal
situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit.''
   The landing abort threatened to strand two cosmonauts in space
with rapidly diminishing supplies of oxygen and food. It came
during a busy year in the Soviet manned space program and at a time
when the American space shuttle still is grounded because of the
Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster, in which all seven crew died.
   The most enduring symbol of Soviet commitment to manned
spaceflight has been the orbiting Mir space station. The research
complex, launched in February 1986, is planned as a permanently
manned fixture in space.
   Two cosmonauts have been aboard Mir since last Dec. 21 and plan
to break the 326-day space endurance record set by Yuri Romanenko
aboard Mir last year. In June, a Soviet-Bulgarian crew spent 10
days in space, including a visit to Mir. A Soviet-French crew is to
blast off Nov. 21 for a monthlong mission.
   Whether the problems with the Afghan-Soviet mission will delay
the Soviet-French flight is not yet clear. Other scheduled flights
include a 1990 voyage by an Austrian cosmonaut and a Malaysian
cosmonaut later.
   Soviet officials also have indicated they will launch their own
space shuttle, unmanned, by year's end. They have emphasized the
shuttle will not be flown manned until it is proven safe.
   The Soviet space program _ long veiled in secrecy since it began
with the Oct. 4, 1957, launch of the first satellite, Sputnik _ has
benefited from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness.
   Since Yuri Gagarin blasted off as the first man in space in
1961, manned launches have become routine.
   Soviet officials gained confidence to show launches and in some
cases landings on live television and to invite foreigners to watch
the blastoffs. The first live TV coverage of a Soviet manned space
launch was the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. The first launch to be
shown live of an all-Russian crew was in 1984.
   Space has also served political purposes for the Soviet Union.
Prior to the Afghan mission, the Soviets had 13 ``guest
cosmonauts'' aboard their spacecraft in flights that serve to show
off their scientific prowess and promote friendly ties with other
countries.
   Soviets have to think back 17 years to find their last fatal
space disaster.
   Three cosmonauts docked with the Salyut-1 space station, and
then during re-entry on June 30, 1971, air leaked out of their
capsule and they suffocated.
   The other casualty of a Soviet space flight was Vladimir
Komarov. Komarov's Soyuz-I capsule crash landed April 24, 1967, but
Soviet officials never explained what exactly went wrong.
   Western space experts believe six to eight other cosmonauts died
in training accidents on the ground from 1960-1975.

   a fire in parched grass and pine exploded
in 24 hours from just 160 acres to more than 25,000 acres Tuesday,
sending firefighters fleeing and burning toward some of Washington
state's prime orchards.
   Fire bosses set up a command post in the tiny Columbia River
town of Entiat, while helicopters dipped huge buckets into the
river and then dumped water on the steep smoldering hillsides above
town.
   The town itself, on the opposite side of the Entiat River from
the fire, was in no immediate danger from the flames, which had
been blown to within an estimated half a mile of the community of
400 people.
   The Dinkelman fire's explosive growth overran at least one
bulldozer that could not move fast enough and a pickup that broke
down, said Art Tasker of the state Department of Natural Resources.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   ``It's extremely erratic and very, very volatile,'' Tasker said.
``There are gusty winds. It's very dry and very steep.
   ``I watched it move a half a mile in 10 minutes last night.''
   National Guard troops called out by Gov. Booth Gardner late
Monday were to handle kitchen and camp duties for about 600
firefighters.
   Intense heat in narrow Mills Canyon caused one home to burst
into flames, even though trails had been dug around the home and
firefighters had burned away excess vegetation, Tasker said.
   The fire, reported Sunday afternoon, was reported at just 500
acres as late as 4:30 p.m. Monday. But by 7:30 p.m. it was 3,000
acres, and by 4 a.m. Tuesday it was at least 20,000 acres.
   The fire was burning on steep hills covered with sage, grass,
pine, and some Douglas fir, and was beginning to butt up against
some orchards in Washington's premier fruit-growing region. The
burned territory was mostly U.S. Forest Service land, but also
included state land and Longview Fibre Co. property.
   ``It's an explosive kind of situation,'' DNR spokesman Rob
Harper said. ``If you look at the conditions out there, eastern
Washington is extremely dry. ... The wind is the final ingredient
that you need after you get the fire started.''

   Jesse Jackson denied on Tuesday that he was
angry that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis excluded
him from a meeting with Illinois party leaders. He said he hoped by
the end of the week to work out his role in the fall campaign.
   Jackson, in a telephone interview from his home in Chicago,
contradicted associates who charecterized him as upset by the
omission _ including one who said he was ``seething.''
   ``I just hate for people to be allowed to put words in my mouth
or give some adjective description of what my emotions are,'' he
said of the associates, who commented only on condition they not be
named.
   He said he spoke by telephone to Dukakis' campaign vice chairman
and confidant, John Sasso, Monday night and Tuesday morning and
they arranged to meet later this week to discuss Jackson's
participation in the campaign and the relationship and message of
the campaign to ``targeted groups'' such as Jackson's constituents
in the primary season.
   Asked if he would get a schedule of campaign appearances at this
meeting, the Democratic presidential runner-up said, ``I certainly
hope so.''
   He said they did not discuss the meeting Dukakis held outside
Jackson's home base of Chicago on Tuesday with state party leaders,
including Sen. Paul Simon, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, and others.
   ``I didn't know anything about it other than the press
inquiries. So I have no comment to make,'' said Jackson.
   ``I'm working. I'm hopeful. I'm registering voters,'' he said.
   Dukakis' state press secretary Judy Erwin said the Tuesday
meeting was more for state leaders, and that Jackson was considered
a national leader.
   Jackson indicated he is anxious to get under way with his part
of the fall campaign, as he agreed to do just before the Democrats
nominated Dukakis at their Atlanta convention this summer.
   He declined to criticize Dukakis, despite a series of omissions
that some Jackson supporters have perceived as slights.
   ``If they don't want his help they ought to tell him,'' said one
top Jackson adviser, who asked not to be identified by name.
   Asked about the appearance that Dukakis has been slow to involve
him in the campaign, Jackson said, ``There are some decisions the
campaign has to make about how it will employ its volunteers,''
including people such as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Sen. Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts and himself.
   ``I assume that's the kind of thing Sasso will be doing,'' he
added.
   ``The plans are incomplete. I hope they will be complete soon.
... hese areas dealing with campaign direction and priorities still
have to be worked out. I hope before this week is out that all of
the remaining areas will be resolved and we'll be on our way.''
   Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach denied any attempt to
slight Jackson and said the meeting with Sasso this week will
include discussion of ``how we can best work together, places
details, themes.''
   He said Jackson regularly talks to Dukakis and campaign
officials.
   Jackson said he wants to talk to Dukakis officials about
involving some of his supporters at the national policy level of
the campaign, and about targeting the Democratic message and
priorities.
   The most recently reported tension involved reports that the
Dukakis camp had conducted polling that found Jackson had high
negative ratings in some states where he beat Dukakis in the
primaries and that the Dukakis officials had indicated they did not
want Jackson campaigning in those states.
   While these reports came from sources close to Jackson and the
national Democratic Party, Jackson himself said he had received no
such direction.
   Asked if the subject of states he should stay away from was
discussed in a meeting he had with Dukakis campaign chairman Paul
Brountas and Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk two
weeks ago, Jackson said, ``I was not in any such meetings when
there was discussion over where and what the priority areas ought
to be.''
   Asked if the information was imparted through aides, as one
source stated, he said, ``I don't have anything in writing on
that.''
   ``I don't want to discuss it because I don't know very much
about it, but obvously I'm free to travel all over the country and
I will,'' he added.
   While some around Jackson have described him as annoyed and
upset at how the Dukakis campaign has treated him and his
constituents, Jackson publicly continues to tout the Dukakis ticket
in his speeches, and refused to make negative comments under
questioning.

<BYLINE>Hamadi Sought Sanctuary In Iran After TWA Hijacking
^By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, accused of
taking part in the hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the killing of a
U.S. Navy diver, went to Iran after the crime, according to court
reports Tuesday.
   The reports, based on transcripts of tapped telephone calls,
were presented to a Frankfurt court. They indicated Hamadi was in
Iran for about three months and was helped while in hiding by
Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has been accused of air piracy
and murder. He went on trial here after West Germany refused a U.S.
extradition request.
   TWA flight 847 was hijacked in June 1985 and 39 Americans were
held captive aboard the plane for 17 days. Navy diver Robert
Stethem was shot and killed by the sky pirates who comandeered the
jet during a flight from Athens to Rome and forced it to land in
Beirut.
   Former hostage Pete W. Hill of Hoffman Estates, Ill., is
scheduled to testify Wednesday. He will be the first American to
testify in the trial that reopened Tuesday after a four-week recess.
   Prosecutors say Hamadi was a member of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian
Shiite group believed to hold most of the 18 foreigners, including
nine Americans, kidnapped by terrorists in Lebanon.
   Hamadi has admitted he was one of the TWA hijackers but insists
he did not kill Stethem, 23.
   The court on Tuesday examined transcripts of tapped telephone
calls Hamadi made from Iran to his brother, Abbas Hamadi, after the
hijacking was over.
   In an Aug. 14, 1985, telephone call to Abbas Hamadi's home in
West Germany, Mohammed Hamadi said, ``I'm phoning from Iran.''
   According to the transcript, Mohammed Hamadi told his brother he
was staying in an Iranian town near the Afghan border and he added:
``I've been here more than a month and it's very boring. I'm just
sitting around.''
   In another telephone call from Iran on Oct. 13, 1985, Mohammed
Hamadi told his brother he was going back to Beirut the next day,
but Abbas Hamadi warned him he would be arrested because he was
wanted by U.S. authorities, according to the transcripts.
   Mohammed Hamadi also said, ``We're going on a military plane to
Syria and then we're taking a military car to Beirut.''
   Abbas Hamadi then asked him who told him about the travel
arrangements and his broher replied, ``The Revolutionary Guards.'
   In earlier testimony Hamadi told the court he was in Iran to
visit Moslem shrines. He refused to answer any questions Tuesday
about his stay in Iran.
   Hamadi had admitted at the trial's session on Aug. 9 before the
recess began that he took part in the hijacking.
   Tuesday he refused to answer answer many questions from Chief
Judge Heiner Mueckenberger about what happened aboard the hijacked
plane but repeated his denial that he killed Stethem.
   ``I already said the other (one of his accomplices) was
responsible and he was the murderer,'' Hamadi said.
   ``Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane,
to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,'' he
said. He would not say who issued those orders.
   Hamadi said again that the hijackers' goal was to force the
release of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel. Shortly after the
hijacking was over Israel released about 700 prisoners.
   U.S. officials have indicted four people in the hijacking,
including Hamadi. West Germany last year rejected a U.S.
extradition request for Hamadi, saying he would be tried here on
the same charges.
   Hamadi was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at Frankfurt airport, when
customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage.
   In April, a Duesseldorf court sentenced Abbas Hamadi to 13 years
in prison for involvement in the abductions of two German
businessmen in Lebanon in an unsuccessful attempt to force West
Germany to free Mohammed Hamadi from prison.

<HEAD>Black Newspaper To Reject Government Ads Promoting Election</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with police seizing tape of Tutu

   Police came to Archbishop
Desmond Tutu's residence Tuesday and seized a tape of a sermon in
which the clergyman defied a government ban and called for an
election boycott, Tutu's spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, the country's largest black-oriented daily newspaper
said Tuesday it will no longer carry government advertisements
promoting the local elections.
   The Sowetan, in a notice on its front page, said: ``It has
become impossible to justify carrying these advertisements when the
community we serve is barred from expressing its sentiments on the
elections.''
   Many blacks oppose participation in any local or regional
elections until the black majority is allowed to vote in national
elections.
   Tutu, whose sermon Sunday defied the government ban on calls for
an election boycott, had offered to provide police with a
transcript of his remarks.
   However, two plainclothes officers came to the Anglican
archbishop's official residence outside Cape Town, produced a
warrant and demanded a recording which Tutu's press aide, John
Allen, had made of the sermon.
   Allen, after consulting the church's legal advisers, gave police
the tape and a statement confirming the contents of the recording.
But Allen said he would not be prepared to give evidence if the
state tried to call him as a witness against Tutu.
   Allen, in a telephone interview, said police had called in
advance to say they were coming and did not ask to see Tutu, who
was meeting with church members.
   In his sermon at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town, Tutu
deliberately defied state-of-emergency regulations by urging both
whites and blacks to boycott nationwide municipal elections
scheduled for Oct. 26.
   A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, Tuesday quoted
unidentified government sources as saying action against Tutu was
likely. It quoted one source as saying failure to act against the
black archbishop would encourage other people to join in calling
for a boycott.
   Violation of the emergency regulations is punishable by up to 10
years in prison.
   The Oct. 26 elections will mark the first time that voters of
all races go to the polls on the same day. The white-controlled
government is depicting the elections as a major step toward
democracy and is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on
advertising to encourage a large turnout.
   Tutu's comments angered Cape Town's mayor, Peter Muller, who
said they could jeopardize the election prospects of liberal
candidates.
   Because of Muller's criticism, Tutu decided not to attend a
ceremony Monday night at which a prominent mixed-race academic, Dr.
Richard van der Ross, become the first non-white to be awarded the
freedom of the city.

   Hundreds of Israeli troops sealed off a West
Bank town Tuesday, cutting telephone lines, arresting more than 150
Palestinians and assembling makeshift army bases in a new tactic
aimed at crushing the uprising.
   Underground leaders distributed a leaflet in the occupied
territories calling on Palestinians to attack Israeli targets with
``more firebombs and more stones, everywhere and anywhere.''
   A 17-year-old Palestinian, shot in the eye on Sunday during
clashes with troops, died of his wounds Tuesday, relatives said. An
Israeli soldier was hurt slightly when he kicked an old pipe that
contained explosives, the army said.
   The death brought to 259 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have also died.
   Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir, a West Bank army commander, said Tuesday's
pre-dawn raid on Qalqilya, backed by helicopters, was the largest
army operation in nine months of unrest.
   The army imposed a curfew on Qalqilya before dawn and soldiers
moved in through outlying orchards and fields, forming a human
chain around the town of 25,000. Troops closed all roads leading to
the city.
   Soldiers carried lists of suspected stone-throwers and arrested
more than 150 Palestinians, the army said.
   Israel television showed dozens of Palestinians, their hands
tied behind their backs, sitting in large open-sided tents. Troops
herded dozens of blindfolded detainees through a major street.
   Reporters in Qalqilya saw dozens of troops patrolling streets
and three Palestinian youths being held in a jeep with their hands
tied behind them.
   Singling out Qalqilya, which lies just inside the West Bank and
only three minutes by car from Tel Aviv's northern suburbs,
appeared to be the army's latest tactic for cracking down on
activist Palestinian towns. The move prompted concern among
Palestinians that other villages would be targeted.
   West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna said the operation
was planned for weeks and targeted Qalqilya because its residents
include key instigators of firebomb and stone-throwing attacks on
Jewish settlers and Israeli troops.
   Mitzna told Israel radio that ``the situation had become
intolerable, therefore we decided (to act) now.''
   Palestinian taxi drivers turned back at army roadblocks reported
seeing four helicopters flying overhead and dozens of army
vehicles, some pulling mobile homes normally used in makeshift army
bases.
   The witnesses said troops knocked down a wall separating a
playground and high school and were pitching tents on the grounds.
   ``It is the first time I've seen such activity. It is really
strange and we are worried other villages will be next,'' one Arab
taxi driver told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   An army spokesman said troops discovered stashes of knives,
hatchets and clubs as well as outlawed underground leaflets in
Qalqilya.
   In the latest leaflet, underground leaders also called for three
general strikes in two weeks, including a strike Thursday to mark
the ninth month of the Palestinian uprising.
   The leaflet also highlighted a deepening split between Moslem
fundamentalists and uprising leaders who support the Palestine
Liberation Organization. It criticized the fundamentalists for
declaring alternative strike days and attacking shopkeepers who did
not comply.
   Abdel Karim Mahmoud Barud, 17, from the Gaza Strip refugee camp
Rafah, who was shot in the eye Sunday, died Tuesday at Tel Hashomer
Hospital near Tel Aviv, his relatives said.
   Hospital officials could not be reached for comment. The army
said it had no information on the death.
   Also Tuesday, troops shot and wounded four Palestinian
teen-agers while confronting stone-throwers in the West Bank town
of Nablus and the Gaza Strip's Nuseirat refugee camp, hospital
officials said. The army said it was checking the report.
   Near Nablus, an Israeli soldier was treated at the scene for
minor injuries and returned to his unit after a pipe bomb exploded.
   Newly released Israeli figures indicated the Palestinian
population growth in the Gaza Strip was fulfilling predictions that
Arabs could outnumber Jews in Israel and its occupied territories
by the year 2000.
   The figures put the annual population growth in the Gaza Strip
at 3.4 percent in 1986, one of the highest rates in the world. This
compares with an annual population growth of 1.3 percent inside
Israel.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Asks Major Powers To Accept World Court Jurisdiction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N.
secretary-general, asked the permanent Security Council members
Tuesday to unequivocally accept compulsory jurisdiction of the
World Court.
   Of the five, only Britain accepts the court's jurisdiction as
compulsory.
   France, China and the Soviet Union have filed no formal
declarations of acceptance, although that does not bar them from
appearing before the court.
   The United States severely curtailed its acceptance of court
jurisdiction in 1984, just before Nicaragua filed a complaint
against the Reagan administration, accusing it of aiding rebels
fighting the Managua government.
   Perez de Cuellar said Tuesday, ``Widespread acceptance of the
jurisdiction of the court as compulsory would, particularly if
taken by the permanent members of the Security Council, put to
maximum use the role of the court as a stabilizing factor in
international relations.''
   The U.N. chief spoke at a ceremony celebrating the 75th
anniversary of the Peace Palace, of which the World Court is the
major tenant. The court, officially known as the International
Court of Justice, is the U.N. judicial branch.
   Dutch Queen Beatrix, Premier Ruud Lubbers and World Court
President Jose-Maria Ruda of Argentina were among the dignitaries
attending.
   The U.S. government boycotted the last 17 months of Nicaragua's
case against it. The court ultimately condemned American support
for the rebels, known as Contras, and ordered an immediate halt to
such aid.
   In an apparent reference to that U.S. move, Perez de Cuellar
said, ``Other (nations) have, when their interests were at stake,
chosen not to take part in the court's proceedings or to ignore its
decisions, a development that gives rise to considerable concern.''
   Only 49 nations now accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the
World Court, which has no enforcement powers and depends on
voluntary adherence to its rulings by nations not recognizing its
authority unequivocally.

   A scandal involving citizens paying thousands
of dollars to avoid military service has shaken Israel, where the
army is considered a sacred institution and most believe their
nation is surrounded by Arab enemies.
   The story of Israelis paying up to $10,000 in bribes to avoid
serving has been front-page news and dominated radio broadcasts
Tuesday.
   ``Shock waves swept through the IDF (Israeli Defense Force, or
army) ... following the disclosure that a network of army personnel
and civilians had been arranging exemptions from military service
in return for bribes,'' the English-language daily Jerusalem Post
said.
   Renaan Gissin, the deputy spokesman for the army, said the
scheme that was revealed Monday with the arrest of 16 people,
including high-ranking officers and doctors, and ``touches on the
very essence of the Israeli Defense Forces _ the sacred principle
here is to do military service.''
   Israel is a nation of 4.1 million residents where both men and
women are drafted at age 18, and men do reserve service of up to 62
days a year until age 55. Many job advertisements ask that
applicants to prove they served in the army. Avoiding service has
long been a social taboo.
   There are virtually no conscientious draft resisters in Israel
and fewer than 300 people have refused service during the last
decade in controversial military operations in places such as
Lebanon and the occupied territories.
   But after the scandal broke Monday, reports surfaced that about
60 people had paid thousands of dollars to escape the draft or
reserve service. Newspapers reported Tuesday that several hundred
people may be involved.
   The army said dozens more arrests are expected.
   Gissin called the number of people involved unprecedented,
saying: ``This is just the tip of the iceberg. The last word has
not been said.''
   The scheme, which investigators say started in November,
reportedly involved falsified medical statements and tampering with
army computers to show men excused from reserve duty. Those
arrested include two lieutenant colonels, two majors and an
orthopedic surgeon.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin described the scheme as an
aberration, but said he would order a full investigation of the
medical exemption system.
   ``We have to remove this disease from the healthy body of the
army with all means available,'' he said on Israel television.
``Parallel to that, we have to examine our means of supervision in
the defense system.''
   Politicians of both the right and left went farther, urging
re-evaluation of Israeli society and saying the values of its
pioneer days were being lost.
   Geula Cohen of the rightist Tehiya Party said such corruption is
rooted in ``an atmosphere of materialism and abandonment of the
ideals of national responsibility.''
   ``We must all do a self-evaluation about the type of society
we're building here, a society where everything can be bought with
power or money,'' said Gad Yatsiv of the left-wing Mapam Party.
   The Hadashot newspaper editorialized: ``A terrible tragedy has
befallen the army. A mafia has overtaken one of its most sensitive
nerve centers. These actions are as bad as selling secrets to the
enemy.''
   The mass-circulation daily Maariv said: ``This is not just fraud
but making profit from bloodshed.''
   Gissin said the army view was that the draft-dodging scheme
``permeated'' from corruption in Israeli society. ``You cannot open
the newspaper without seeing such affairs of bribery and fraud,''
he said. ``But it is inconceivable to have it in the IDF because it
is a unique institution.''
   Dan Horowitz, a sociologist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University,
said Israel shared _ like other societies _ the problem of
corruption.
   But he expressed surprise the scheme had not been uncovered
sooner because of Israelis' special attitude to the military.
   ``What amazes me is the number of people involved and nobody
informed the authorities,'' he said. ``It means there are no more
taboos in Israeli society, people don't want to be involved.''

<TEXT>
   Police on Tuesday captured a
convicted murderer who escaped from a U.S. prison where he was
awaiting execution.
   Police Inspector Vic Hawkins said Joseph Kindler, 27, who beat a
man to death in Philadelphia in 1984, was arrested at work by Saint
John police.
   Hawkins would not say where Kindler worked because ``the people
there are terrified.''
   Police said they received a tip Monday from a local resident
that Kindler was in the city. He was arrested Tuesday morning
without incident and was remanded to the Saint John jail at an
afternoon court appearance.
   He will be held in Saint John until Quebec police take him back
on an outstanding warrant, according to Hawkins.
   He said Kindler was convicted of first-degree murder in 1984 but
escaped from a maximum-security prison.
   In 1986 he was arrested in Quebec and was being held for a
deportation hearing in Montreal when he escaped again.
   Kindler, who faces execution in the United States, slid down
bedsheets to get away from his 13th-floor cell in a detention
centre at Quebec's provincial police headquarters in Montreal.
   He had been living in the area of St-Jovite, Quebec, before he
disappeared last spring, Hawkins said.
   He said that in the 1984 murder Kindler bludgeoned a man to
death with a baseball bat.
   Hawkins said an FBI report stated, ``Kindler has been armed with
a handgun in the past and has stated he will never be taken alive.''
   It had been reported here that Kindler was on the FBI's list of
10 most wanted criminals, but FBI spokeswoman Melanie McElhinney
said in Washington that was not correct.
   She said Kindler ``was what we call an identification order
fugitive,'' and that classification is ``a step below the top'' 10
most wanted people.
   Criminals in that classificiation are considered to be ``very
dangerous individuals, usually wanted for murder, things like that,
very serious crimes,'' she added.
   Kindler had been the subject in one of the programs of the
television show ``America's Most Wanted.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic accidents during the Labor Day weekend on
the nation's roads killed more than 400 people, which is slightly
lower than the death toll a year ago.
   By midnight Monday, state and local police in the 50 states had
recorded 422 deaths since the holiday period began at 6 p.m. local
time Friday.
   ``We're making some progress,'' said Richard Tippie, director of
traffic safety for the National Safety Council of Chicago. During
the 1987 Labor Day weekend, authorities reported 453 traffic deaths
nationwide.
   Tippie attributed the lower figures to fewer travelers and
greater safety awareness.
   ``People are cutting back and not taking as many trips as they
used to take, and when they do, they buckle up or make sure not to
drink and drive,'' he said.
   California, the most populous state, had the highest number of
traffic fatalities at 45, followed by Texas with 30 and Florida at
27.
   Delaware, North Dakota, Rhode Island and South Dakota each
reported no fatal accidents.
   The council had estimated that 420 to 520 people could lose
their lives in highway accidents during the holiday period.
   Safety-council statisticians say 410 traffic deaths could be
expected during a non-holiday, three-day weekend at this time of
the year.
   The highest toll for the Labor Day holiday was logged in 1968,
when 688 people were killed.

   The nation's three mightiest rivers
began receding Tuesday but the most urgent problem grew: how to
provide food, shelter and clean water to at least 21 million
homeless people and prevent an epidemic.
   ``This is the worst flood in the history of Bangladesh,''
President Hussain Mohammed Ershad said to about 300 men, women and
children huddled in front of him on a narrow embankment surrounded
by brown water.
   A soldier doled out scoops of uncooked rice and Ershad told the
people more food would be found.
   Floods have submerged three-fourths of the country in the past
10 days and 12 smaller rivers were reported still rising Tuesday,
although the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna receded. The flooding
began in June with the monsoon season, then abated and resumed last
month.
   At least 412 people have been killed since June, according to
government figures, but that number is considered too low. Daily
death reports in Dhaka newspapers, including 32 people who drowned
when a ferry sank in the Pabna district 75 miles west of the
capital, put the total at 1,154.
   Illness from flood-polluted water is increasing. The government
health control center reported 10,000 new cases of diarrhea
Tuesday, bringing the total to 102,000, and said 79 people had died
of it. Those totals include only cases in areas that still can
communicate with Dacca.
   Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman said Sunday that 21 million
people were homeless.
   The United States has committed nearly $3.6 million to
Bangladesh flood relief, the U.S. Agency for International
Development said Tuesday.Disaster management experts will be sent
to Dhaka to help assess the situation and advise on further
assistance, the agency said.
   Ataul Karim, ambassador to the United States, said Tuesday in an
interview with CBS: ``It's totally unprecedented. ... It's an
aberration of nature. In 24 hours the whole country went under
water. There is hardly any high ground anywhere.'' He said 28
million people were homeless.
   Bangladesh is a region of deltas for rivers that rush down from
the Himalayas during the annual monsoon rains. Erling Dessau, head
of the U.N. Development Program, said: ``There should not be 110
million people living here. I think nature should have been left to
itself.''
   The government says it is too early to assess total damage or
how much money will be needed for food supplies and reconstruction.
Ershad said during a tour of flooded areas by helicopter and motor
launch, however, that the cost of restoring roads and rail lines
alone will be $156 million.
   He and other government officials have said Bangladesh needs 3
million tons of grain from abroad. ``We will have to feed the
people for two months at least,'' Ershad said in a brief chat with
reporters during the tour Tuesday.
   Floods came at the worst time for food production in Bangladesh,
which was East Pakistan until 1971. It became independent after a
civil war in which India supported the rebels. Half its annual
production of 16.5 million tons of rice was in the ground when rice
paddies across the country were inundated.
   Bangladesh has three rice-growing seasons each year, but the
current one normally produces the most and the projected yield had
been 8 million tons. The government says at least 2 million tons
will be lost.
   An old farmer who approached Ershad during a stop at Bailtali,
55 miles southwest of Dhaka, said: ``We may save part of the crop''
if the water is gone soon, but ``if the water stays more than seven
days, it is all lost.''
   Government warehouses held about 1.3 million tons of rice when
the floods began. A military officer familiar with the storage
facilities said water had seeped into many warehouses but the
extent of damage was not known.
   When a helicopter following Ershad's flew over a rice warehouse
at Takerhat, 75 miles southwest of Dhaka, water covered the four
long sheds up to their roofs.
   It was evident water was draining from some areas. Bright green
blades of rice plants poked above the surface in paddies that had
been submerged 24 hours earlier.
   At Rajbari, a town of 50,000 people 45 miles west of Dhaka, men
and women stood in chest-deep water as Ershad arrived in a motor
launch.
   Rice paddies on the edge of town were under even deeper water. A
boatman used his bamboo pole to measure the depth and it showed
about 8 feet.
   Three miles away, 2,000 people took refuge on a road embankment
when their villages were flooded.
   Shamsul Haq, a 35-year-old weaver from Bagmara, a village half a
mile away, said he built a raft of bamboo poles to take his wife
and two children to the embankment.
   He said his mud and straw house was under water but he would
rebuild it. He said the loom with which he earns his living also
was under water, but it would dry.
   Haq said he had nowhere else to go, even though his house also
was flooded last year and might be flooded next year.
   Population density in Bangladesh is about 2,000 people per
square mile and per capita annual income of $150 puts it among the
world's poorest nations.

   Food and water poisoning killed three
people and hospitalized more than 150 in two separate incidents,
police said Tuesday.
   They said 53 victims were poisoned by eating meat sandwiches
late Monday at a restaurant in the northern port of Tripoli.
   ``Most of the 53 ... came in screaming from severe stomach
aches,'' said a nurse at a Tripoli hospital.
   ``Later they started fainting and than three died. There was
nothing we could do,'' she added, refusing to give her name.
   The owner of the restaurant on Tripoli's fashionable Azmi Street
was arrested.
   In south Lebanon, more than 100 people were hospitalized Tuesday
after drinking from an artesian well in the village of Rzai, 15
miles northeast of the ancient port city of Tyre, police reported.
   ``The poisoning is due to an overdose of chlorine used to purify
the well's water,'' said Dr. Raymond Saarour at Tyre's government
hospital.
   Sources at the Health Ministry in Beirut said medical and other
supplies would be sent to Tyre to help cope with the emergency.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dukakis-Bentsen campaign on Tuesday
gave a preview of of a television ad touting the Democrats' efforts
to win a plant closing notification law.
   Tom Cosgrove, Texas campaign director for the presidential
ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, said the Democrats'
commercial reflects an emphasis on ``the future of the economy in
this country.''
   The commercial, which starts airing Wednesday in Dallas, Houston
and San Antonio, said that Bentsen ``won the fight'' in the Senate
as sponsor of the law requiring 60 days' notice of a plant closing.
   A ``fact sheet'' handed out at the screening said GOP vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle, an Indiana senator, had opposed
the plant closing notification bill.
   President Reagan first vetoed a trade bill that contained the
measure, then allowed a separate bill to become law without his
signature. The Democrats said Vice President George Bush also
opposed the legislation.
   Charlie Black, a senior adviser to the national GOP presidential
campaign and ``Texas-specific'' consultant, said the plant-closing
law is ``a phony issue.''
   ``Plant closing is a way of them continuing to duck the issues,
because they haven't presented anything about the economy that
would give people any hope that they could improve on the Reagan
performance or the future Bush performance,'' Black said.

   Sunshine prevailed across most of the nation Tuesday after an
unseasonably cool morning, but some rain continued in Florida,
southeast Georgia and coastal sections of the Carolinas.
   Flooding was a problem around Gainesville, Fla., and in parts of
western central Florida. Thunderstorms brought locally heavy rain
along a stationary front that extended through northern Florida.
   About 30 cities had record low temperatures Tuesday morning,
including Peoria, Ill., at 41 degrees; Nashville, Tenn., 51;
Phillips, Wis., 31; and Hibbing, Minn., 31.
   Other record lows for the date were Allentown, Pa., 42 degrees;
Binghamton, N.Y., 39; Burlington, Iowa, 44; Des Moines, Iowa, 42;
Dubuque, Iowa, 38; Eau Claire, Wis., 37; Evansville, Ind., 45;
Green Bay, Wis., 38; Kansas City, Mo., 48; Lexington, Ky., 45;

Paducah, Ky., 43; St. Cloud, Minn., 35; St. joseph, Mo., 38; Terre
Haute, Ind., 43; Topeka, Kan., 41; Waterloo, Iowa, 35.
   A frost warning was posted for Wednesday morning for the
northern mountains of western Pennsylvania. Scattered frost also
was possible in rural areas of western New York.
   Cool weather continued Tuesday across most of the eastern half
of the nation, but warming took place in Texas and western portions
of the northern and central Plains. A few readings were near the 90
degree mark in Texas, Colorado and Montana.
   The western third of the nation had mostly 80s, but afternoon
temperatures were as low as the 50s and 60s in western Washington
and Oregon and along the northern California coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Jamestown, N.Y., to 105 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The nation's low Tuesday morning was 25 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for showers and thunderstorms
continuing along and ahead of a stationary front over the Carolina
coast, southeast Georgia and the Florida peninsula. Windy
conditions were expected to spread across the northern Rockies, the
northern and central Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley. Most
of the nation should have sunny skies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s in New England,
New York, the central Appalachians and western Washington. Readings
in the 90s were predicted for the Plains from Texas to eastern
Wyoming and western South Dakota and for parts of western Colorado,
Utah, and southwest Oregon, and to near 105 in parts of Nevada,
interior valleys of California and the desert Southwest. The
remainder of the nation should have highs in the 70s and 80s.

   An American couple recovering from
burns suffered during an air show crash in West Germany said
Tuesday they still wonder how they survived, and vowed never to
attend another aerobatic exhibition.
   Air Force Sgt. Jeffrey McCanch, 23, his wife, Tammy McCanch, 21,
and their 28-month-old son, Jeffrey, are among a group of Americans
being treated at the burn unit of Brooke Army Medical Center.
   Fifty-three people died and several hundred others were injured
after three Italian jets crashed during a demonstration at Ramstein
Air Force Base, West Germany, on Aug. 28.
   McCanch said he and his family were sitting together when the
crash occurred and that parts of the aircraft landed about 30 feet
near them.
   The McCanchs were burned on their hands, but their son, who was
asleep on the ground at the time, was burned on his face, neck,
back, legs and chest.
   ``It was just like a nightmare,'' Ms. McCanch said. ``When I was
laying there on the ground ... I just kept on saying, `This is not
real. It's not happening.''
   Both McCanches said they would never go to another air show as
spectators, but disagreed on whether air shows should be banned.
   ``I don't think there is a purpose for them,'' said Ms. McCanch,
whose parents live in Indianapolis, Ind.
   But her husband, who is assigned to bomb disposal unit at Kapaun
Air Station near Ramstein, said the public is interested in the
expensive aircraft.
   ``It shows the public the capabilities of the aircraft,'' he
said.
   McCanch said that he was trying to take pictures with a small
camera when he saw the aircraft collide. He said the impact knocked
them several feet away from their son and he had to race back to
pick him up.
   After their son's condition stabilized, the three were flown to
the Texas burn unit. The boy had a skin graft Tuesday.
   ``He's doing fine. He sees us all the time. He wants to be with
us as much as we can,'' Ms. McCanch said.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration's chief
administrative law judge Tuesday recommended legalizing marijuana
as a prescription drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis and
nausea suffered by cancer patients in chemotherapy.
   The judge, Francis L. Young, found that ``marijuana, in its
natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active
substances known to man.''
   ``By any measure of rational analysis, marijuana can be safely
used within a supervised routine of medical care,'' Young said in a
68-page set of recommendations and findings.
   ``The judge realizes that strong emotions are aroused on both
sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana,'' he said.
   ``Nonetheless it is essential for this agency, and its
administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of
record, correctly to apply the law, and act accordingly.''
   The recommendation is not binding on the DEA's administrator,
John Lawn, who must make a final decision on whether to place
marijuana on Schedule II, the list of drugs that can be given to
patients with a doctor's prescription.
   Young rejected as ``specious'' the argument that medicinal use
of marijuana would encourage its use as a recreational drug.
   ``The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to
override the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of
countless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when
prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case.''
   ``Marijuana can be harmful,'' Young said. ``Marijuana is abused.
But the same is true of dozens of drugs or substances which are
listed in Schedule II so that they can be employed in treatment by
physicians in proper cases, despite their abuse potential.''
   Kevin Zeese, an attorney for the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, which has sued to have marijuana placed
on Schedule II, called the decision ``a very important step in the
process.''
   ``While it is not binding, we hope that the DEA will look at it
fresh and take the facts and reach a sensible conclusion,'' Zeese
said.
   The decision by Lawn or his successor will be reviewed by the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here, which in 1980 ordered DEA to
conduct hearings.
   The appellate court, which had twice previously remanded the
issue to DEA, has been critical of the agency's handling of the
16-year-old case, Zeese said.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said Lawn ``won't have any
comment until he has had a chance to look at'' Young's report.
   Dougherty said both sides have 20 days to file exceptions to
Young's findings. Before making a final decision on the case, Lawn
could opt to hold additional hearings, he said.
   Young cited the testimony of doctors and patients during 11 days
of hearings as evidence to conclude that marijuana is a medically
accepted treatment for multiple sclerosis, hyperparathyroidism and
the nausea suffered by some cancer patients who undergo
chemotherapy.
   Young found that marijuana cigarettes were more effective at
controlling nausea than capsules containing synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the chemically active ingredient of
cannabis.
   When smoked, ``natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes
effect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested
and must be processed through the digestive system before it takes
effect,'' Young said.
   The opinion also cited efforts by several states _ including New
Mexico, Louisiana and Georgia _ to experiment with marijuana as
medicine.
   Between 1979 and 1986, patients in at least 10 New Mexico
hospitals smoked marijuana cigarettes supplied by the federal
government under an experimental state program that showed it was
``highly effective'' in controlling nausea, he said.
   Louisiana's effort to make marijuana available to cancer
patients was frustrated by federal insistence that doctors use the
drug only in a research program, Young said.
   The administrative law judge made no recommendation for
marijuana's use to treat glaucoma, saying the petitioners had
failed to produce sufficient evidence that ``a respectable minority
of physicians'' supported their view that marijuana is an effective
treatment for glaucoma, a disease that attacks the optic nerve and
eventually causes blindness.
   But Young noted that ``two highly qualified and experienced
ophthalmologists'' have accepted marijuana as a drug to treat
glaucoma. He also noted that there are only a limited number of
drugs available to treat the disease and all produce side effects,
many of them serious.
   The placement of marijuana on Schedule II wouldn't automatically
make it available as a prescription drug. Young noted that state
and federal agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration,
would have to pass further judgment.
   Marijuana is currently a Schedule I drug along with heroin, PCP,
and LSD. Its possession carries federal and state criminal
penalties.
   Under federal law, simple possession of small amounts of
marijuana carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a $5,000
fine. The law carries stiffer penalties for possession of larger
quantities where prosecutors can prove there was an intent to sell
the drug.

<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday the promised
``round table'' talks with workers will begin this month but gave
no indication it would grant the main demand, legalizing Solidarity.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said supporters of the outlawed
free trade union movement should join existing official unions and
try to reshape them from within. The official union federation,
called OPZZ, said it would oppose allowing new unions into plants
where it is established.
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, who persuaded workers to stop
striking in return for the negotiations, declared ``Let them
talk,'' but also said such statements ``could destroy the round
table.''
   An OPZZ resolution said Premier Zbigniew Messner's government
should resign. Its leaders have said government officials should be
held personally accountable for economic problems that led to a
nationwide wave of strikes last month.
   Numerous signs in the official press and in speeches at a party
conference last month have pointed to changes in the government at
the next parliament session, which is expected this month. Such a
shakeup would not affect the Communist Party leadership, which
holds the real power.
   Urban said at his first news conference since the strikes ended
Saturday that talks with Walesa and other worker delegates will
start this month and include several dozen people.
   He said the government wants the meetings to begin as soon as
possible after preparatory work is finished, but also said they
will be canceled automatically if any more ``political'' strikes
occur.
   Talks will cover speeding economic reform, reaching a national
consensus for reform, improving living standards and democratizing
Poland, he said.
   Walesa talked supporters into ending the strikes last week after
getting a commitment from Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak for
negotiations whose topics would include Solidarity.
   The first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc was born in
the labor turmoil of 1980 at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where
Walesa works as an electrician. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's
government imposed martial law in December 1981 to suppress
Solidarity and outlawed it the next year.
   Asked about Solidarity's demand for a return to legal status,
Urban said that allowing two trade unions in one plant was
unacceptable.
   ``If followers of some tendency connected in the past with
Solidarity are a majority in a given plant, then they can either
join the (official) trade union, outnumbering it and directing it
where they wish, or form a coalition, a compromise body'' with the
official union.
   ``The existing legal rules offer a broad scope of
possibilities,'' he said, and Solidarity activists made a
``historical mistake'' in boycotting the new government unions
created in 1982 after Solidarity was outlawed.
   Urban said a pro-Solidarity union could be formed in a plant
where no union existed, but would not be permitted to use the name
Solidarity ``in the present legal situation.''
   Reached at home in Gdansk after Urban's news conference, Walesa
said: ``Let them talk. But they should remember that they could
destroy the round table by such irresponsible statements. This is
all I can say.''
   Solidarity activists say they want their own union, not
membership in the unions established by the government under
martial law.

   Arab guerrillas fired a rocket on Tuesday at a

igniting a fire but inflicting no casualties, Israel radio reported.
   It said the Soviet-designed Katyusha rocket struck a South
Lebanon Army militia position near Hasbaya in Israel's
self-declared security zone.
   Israel established the six- to 10-mile-wide zone north of its
border after withdrawing the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in
1985, ending a three-year occupation.
   About 1,000 Israeli troops and 1,500 fighters of the

   Vice President George Bush, declaring
Republicans have provided good jobs at good wages, was angrily
booed and jeered Tuesday by hard-hat shipyard workers chanting,
``Union buster, union buster'' and ``Go home, George.''
   Bush encountered the hostile reaction from boilermakers,
pipefitters, laborers and electricians during a speech at the
Northwest Marine Iron Works.
   Trying to win votes in a state where he acknowledged he trailed
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, Bush said, ``Do not gamble on
another liberal Democrat coming out of nowhere.''
   He told the crowd of several hundred, ``Don't listen to all this
Dukakis stuff. They're on the ropes and they've got to make all
this noise.''
   Bush appeared to have a smattering of support in the audience
and was able to win a few cheers when he said he supported the
death penalty for drug kingpins and for criminals who kill police
officers.
   The workers also applauded when Bush declared his opposition to
furlough programs for prison inmates.
   However, the audience was largely unfriendly. One prominent sign
read, ``Union busting, scab-loving Bush.'' Several people shouted
obscenities at Bush during his speech.
   The vice president said the Reagan administration had brought
the prime interest rate down from 21 percent and had slashed
inflation. He said, ``We're making progress for the working man and
women in this country.''
   He pledged anew never to raise taxes _ drawing some applause _
and urged the crowd to ``get that same pledge out of the
Democrats.''
   Opening a two-state swing _ taking him later to Everett in
Washington, another state where Bush said he was trailing _ he said
his goal was to provide a good job at a good wage for everyone who
wanted one.
   ``Good jobs at good wages'' is a main Dukakis campaign theme.
   When Bush credited the Reagan administration with providing 18
million new jobs over the past six years, the audience booed.
   ``I know the truth sometimes hurts,'' Bush said.
   At times he appeared combative and did not flinch from the
heated encounter. When tensions seemed high at one point, Bush said
``little drama'' and pulled out a 1950 union card showing that he
was a dues-paying member of the steelworkers then.
   ``The Democrats are trying to mislead you, predicting gloom and
doom,'' Bush said.
   ``It's quite simple: The other party won't get elected unless
things get worse, and things aren't going to get worse unless they
get elected.''
   Bush said Dukakis was looking for problems in America's
``new-found American strength.'' The ice president also said of
Dukakis, ``It's all a mistake, he'll tell you. Quick, before it's
too late, we'd better get serious, he'll tell you, and return to
the policies of Jimmy Carter.''
   ``We just cannot go back and lose the progress that we've made
in this country.''
   After his speech, Bush bought a sandwich from a lunch truck and
ate it during a meeting with some of the workers. One of them
challenged him to explain why his wages have gone from $13.36 to
$9.50 per hour during the Reagan administration.
   ``You're going through a competitive change,'' Bush said,
referring to the foreign challenge to U.S. shipyards.
   Over lunch, Bush appeared unperturbed by the crowd's reaction.
``All I need is 51 percent of the vote,'' he said.
   Dukakis, en route from a campaign appearance in Chicago to
Boston, said Bush's comments reflected an inability to comprehend
the needs of the average American.
   ``George Bush made it clear today that he really does not
understand the hopes and dreams and aspiration of millions and
millions of American workers across this country,'' Dukakis said.
``That's not an adequate answer to American workers.''
   Later in the day, Bush got a decidedly different welcome from an
audience at a non-union manufacturing plant in Washington.
   A crowd of about 500 people at the Fluke Manufacturing Co.,
which specializes in electronic instruments, gave the vice
president a warm, polite reception as he spoke about jobs and the
economy.
   ``Incomes are rising, unemployment is falling and I'll tell 'ya,
things are on the move in this country,'' he said.
   ``Some don't want us to believe that things are getting better
in this country,'' the vice president said. ``My opponent is one of
them, frankly.''
   Bush and his staff said they were not upset by the reception
earlier in Portland.
   ``You're talking to people you've got to convert. I think we
converted a few,'' said Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff.
   For his part, Bush told the lunchroom crowd of workers earlier,
``You don't let them rattle you. It's like being a baseball player
when you're out there, 3-and-2, the bases loaded, two runs behind
and somebody begins yelling out. You can't stop concentrating on
what you're doing.''
   In Everett, Bush used an interview with newspaper and broadcast
correspondents to urge both side in the race not to disrupt the
campaign.
   ``I'd like to use this forum right here to appeal to my
supporters and his to at least let people speak without harassing.
But when it happens you don't need to get all uptight about it and
act like you're being put upon because this is the way it works at
this level of politics,'' Bush said.
   On Air Force Two, carrying him to Portland from Los Angeles,
Bush accused Dukakis of running a negative campaign.
   ``He has to tear down. He has to make everything negative to be
elected. I don't have to be responding to him.''
   Bush said Dukakis' contention Tuesday that the Reagan
administration has been anti-union was a ``stupid charge.''
   Even though polls show that Bush has largely erased Dukakis'
once-large lead, Bush said, ``I'm campaigning as the underdog.
Being even is like being the underdog as far as I'm concerned.''
   Bush was next flying to Louisville, Ky, to make a speech
Wednesday before the American Legion.

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar has accepted an invitation from President P.W. Botha to
visit South Africa, the United Nations said Tuesday.
   ``A mutually convenient time for the visit is being discussed,''
said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes. ``When the visit materializes,
the secretary-general will use the opportunity to visit certain
other countries in the region.''
   Botha extended the invitation Aug. 1.
   The U.N. Security Council frequently condemns South Africa
because of its system of apartheid, under which the nation's 5
million whites control the country and the 26 million blacks have
no vote in national affairs.
   The announcement comes as South Africa is discussing plans for
withdrawal from neighboring South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, in conjunction with Cuba's withdrawing its troops from
Angola.
   South Africa has withdrawn its troops from southern Angola,
where they had been supporting the guerrillas of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola in UNITA's fight against
Angola's Marxist government.
   South Africa has said it will withdraw its troops from Namibia
on Nov. 1 as a first step of a Security Council plan for Namibia's
independence.
   Under the council plan, Namibia would achieve independence in
one year.
   A major stumbling block is South African insistence that the
Cubans leave Angola as quickly as South Africa withdraws from
Namibia.
   A new round of peace talks among South Africa, Cuba, Angola and
U.S. mediators is to be held this week in Brazzaville, Congo.

   President Reagan was sporting a small
adhesive bandage on his right arm Tuesday, the result of a minor
mishap while performing chores on his California ranch.
   Reagan, during a stop in Nebraska as he traveled back to
Washington from California, was asked by reporters what had
happened and replied: ``chopping wood.''
   Asked by reporters traveling with Reagan aboard Air Force One
about the bandage, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
``while clearing wood yesterday (Monday) afternoon a small branch
punctured the president's skin on the inside of his right wrist.''
   Fitzwater said the injury required no stitches.

   Anti-abortion demonstrators disrupted a
speech Tuesday by Democrat Michael Dukakis to Polish-American
supporters, some of whom physically ejected a few of the protesters
in a melee of pushing and shoving.
   Some punches were thrown, but police said there were no arrests
in the incident, the most serious in a series of anti-abortion
protests at appearances by the Democratic presidential nominee in
recent weeks.
   Dukakis, after the interruption at the start of his speech at a
banquet hall in this Chicago suburb, delivered his prepared remarks
in which he emphasized economic themes and said his Republican
rivals ``love to blame American workers first.''
   He ridiculed Republican presidential nominee George Bush for
saying last fall that Detroit automakers could use the abilities of
Soviet tank mechanics.
   ``He said the American auto industry could use a few good
mechanics from the Soviet Union who could teach our workers
something about quality,'' Dukakis said. ``Do you really believe we
in America have anything to learn from a society where workers have
no rights, consumers have no choices, and even Mr. Gorbachev admits
their economy is a shambles?''
   ``Those Republicans in Washington love to blame American workers
first,'' he said.
   Last fall, during a trip to Europe, Bush said he'd been told in
a meeting of NATO ministers that 350 Soviet tanks had completed
maneuvers without a breakdown.
   ``Hey, when the mechanics who keep those tanks running run out
of work in the Soviet Union, send them to Detroit because we could
use that kind of ability,'' Bush said at the time. Later, he
apologized to U.S. autoworkers, adding, ``Hey give me a break; I
didn't mean anything by it.''
   Following his appearance, Dukakis told reporters that protests
such as the one he faced were to be expected.
   ``It's a democracy and those of us in public life know from time
to time that there are going to be people who may tend to be a
little loud and disruptive,'' he said.
   ``I just hope as the campaign goes on we can address the real
issues that face the campaign and that face the country and do so
in a way that's respectful of each other.''
   Dukakis repeated his position that he opposes abortion but that
``in the last analysis it's up to the woman in the exercise of her
own conscience and religious beliefs to make that decision.''
   Dukakis ran into trouble of a different sort when he tried to
leave Illinois for a campaign event in Columbus, Ohio. Federal
Aviation Administration officials pulled a surprise safety
inspection of his chartered Presidential Airways Boeing 737,
grounding him in Chicago.
   He canceled the Columbus appearance and flew back to Boston on
his backup plane, accompanied by as many news people as the plane
could hold.
   After landing in Boston, Dukakis told reporters that the timing
of the FAA's spot inspection was ``very curious,'' but declined to
comment further.
   Campaign spokesman Dayton Duncan said the inspection could have
been performed overnight, ``not 15 minutes before we were supposed
to leave.'' Later, he added, ``We're looking forward to the moment
in January when he gets to name the FAA administrator.''
   Stan Rivers, acting administrator for the FAA regional office in
Chicago, said, ``It's not a new policy. It goes on in every
campaign.''
   During the speech disruption earlier, Dukakis told the
protesters, ``I respect your right to disagree with me. That's what
a democracy is all about. ... I would hope you would respect my
right to speak.''
   When the demonstrators refused to quiet down, a half dozen or so
were forced out of the crowd of some 1,000 people. In the back of
the room protesters and others in the crowd scuffled. Several
punches were thrown at the protesters.
   The people who evicted the protesters did not appear to be
security personnel, and campaign spokeman Dayton Duncan said they
were not campaign workers. Secret Service agents protecting Dukakis
did not move toward the protests.
   Just as Dukakis was about to begin, the protesters had shouted
``What about abortion?'' The crowd tried to drown them out by
chanting ``We want Mike.'' As Dukakis tried to proceed, other
protesters shouted ``You're a baby killer.''
   One protester, Richard Freeman, 46, of Chicago, said members of
several area anti-abortion groups met a week ago to plan protests
of any Dukakis events. ``If Dukakis is within 300 miles of a
pro-life activist, they're going to go out and greet him,'' he said.
   Joseph M. Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action
League, said the group obtained tickets to the event from the
Democrats, ``and we decided we were going to inject the issue of
abortion whenever it seemed relevant.''
   One spectator obviously upset by the demonstators, Marion Reis,
said he opposes abortion and has donated money to pro-life groups.
He said he would make no further donations, adding, ``I think
they're full of hate, not full of love.''
   There seemed to be only a handful of protesters inside the hall
and perhaps 20 or 30 outside.
   One day earlier, more than 100 demonstrators chanted as Dukakis
met outdoors with residents of a South Philadelphia neighborhood.
Other groups of similar protesters have shown up to heckle him but
previously had not delayed him from speaking.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis also met in private with Illinois Democratic
leaders, not including Jesse Jackson who was said to be upset about
that omission.
   Dukakis' state press secretary, Judy Erwin, said Jackson was not
included in the meetings because he is regarded as a national
leader and Tuesday's meetings were to focus on the Illinois state
campaign.
   In Niles, Dukakis paid tribute to the Polish trade movement
Solidarity and its leader, Lech Walesa, saying the Polish
government ``must engage in a productive dialogue'' with the union.
``Solidarity must be recognized,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis repeated his economic themes that contend the American
middle class has been caught in an economic squeeze, with declining
buying power and stagnant wages, during the Reagan administration.

   Presidential rivals George Bush and Michael Dukakis encountered
loud, hostile demonstrators Tuesday as Oregon shipyard workers
shouted ``union buster'' at the Republican candidate and
anti-abortion activists called the Democratic nominee ``baby
killer.''
   ``Do not gamble on another liberal Democrat coming out of
nowhere,'' Bush said, shouting to be heard over the boos of workers
at Northwest Marine Iron Works in Portland, Ore.
   In the Chicago suburb of Niles, Ill., Dukakis was interrupted
for several minutes by the anti-abortion protesters early in a
speech on economic policy.
   ``I just hope as the campaign goes on we can address the real
issues that face the campaign and that face the country and do so
in a way that's respectful of each other,'' he said afterward.

   In an appearance before the American Legion, President Reagan
described the Democrats as advocating ``a Disneyland defense
policy'' and embodying ``the liberal ideology of decline and
retreat.''
   Reagan, returning to the White House from a California vacation,
stopped in Louisville, Ky., to address the Legion convention.
   ``Yes, it comes down to this: After eight hard years of
rebuilding America's strength, do we really want to return to a
Disneyland defense policy _ with Mickey Mouse treatment of our men
and women in uniform, Goofy strategic plans and Donald Duck-like
lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own
blankety-blank fault?'' Reagan asked.
   Reagan said the Democrats were promoting a ``hit list'' of
cancellations and delays for the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, the
Trident submarine missile and two proposed carrier battle groups
for the Navy.
   ``To that they've added nearly every major new weapons system to
become prominent on the scene since the last liberal administration
went to its reward, including the Midgetman missile, the Stealth
bomber and our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' he said.
   Dukakis, however, has said he supports the advanced D-5 Trident
missile and continued development of the Stealth bomber, so-called
because of its ability to escape radar detection.

   The heckling in Illinois and Oregon was some of the most intense
either candidate has faced during the campaign.
   Dukakis also had transportation troubles, being forced to cancel
an appearance in Columbus, Ohio, when a surprise Federal Aviation
Administration safety inspection of his campaign plane prevented
his scheduled departure from Chicago.
   Campaign spokesman Dayton Duncan complained that ``our plane has
been parked here since last night and surely, if our plane needed
to be inspected, it would have been convenient for us to have it
done last night, not 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave.''
   After landing in Boston, Dukakis told reporters that the timing
of the FAA's spot inspection ``was very curious,'' but declined to
comment further.
   Stan Rivers, acting administrator for the FAA regional office
based in Chicago, said: ``It's not a new policy. It goes on in
every campaign.''
   Meanwhile, agreement appeared set for three debates this fall _
two between the presidential candidates and one between the vice
presidential nominees.
   Agreement still had not been reached on timing and format, said
Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas after a telephone
conversation with Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III.
   Brountas said he and Baker would talk again Wednesday.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen ran into some
partisan heckling from Bush supporters at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute.
   The hecklers confronted Bentsen at an outdoor rally at the
college after the Texas senator delivered an education speech. They
carried signs that read ``Duke Buster'' and ``Avoid the Lloyd.''
   At the Portland shipyard, Bush was booed when he said 18 million
new jobs were created during the past six years of the Reagan
administration. ``I know the truth sometimes hurts,'' he said.
   The crowd chanted, ``Union buster,'' but Bush contined to speak
in a loud voice, telling the workers: ``The Democrats are trying to
mislead you. ... Things aren't going to get worse unless they get
elected.''
   Many of the workers carried anti-Bush signs that accused him of
being anti-union. One read: ``Union Busting, Scab-Loving Bush.''
   Later in the day, Bush got a decidedly different welcome from an
audience at a non-union manufacturing plant in Everett, Wash.
   A crowd of about 500 people at the Fluke Manufacturing Co.,
which specializes in electronic instruments, gave the vice
president a warm, polite reception as he spoke about jobs and the
economy.
   Dukakis was speaking to a Polish-American audience when
protesters shouted ``What about abortion?'' The crowd tried to
drown them out by chanting ``We want Mike.'' As Dukakis tried to
proceed, other protesters shouted ``You're a baby killer.''
   ``I respect your right to disagree with me,'' said Dukakis.
``That's what a democracy is all about. ... I would hope you would
respect my right to speak.''
   When the demonstrators refused to quiet down, a half dozen or so
were forced out of the crowd of some 1,000 people. In the back of
the room people scuffled and several punches were thrown.
   Dukakis repeated his position that he opposes abortion but that
``in the last analysis it's up to the woman in the exercise of her
own conscience and religious beliefs to make that decision.''
   He said a woman who has an abortion should not be branded ``a
criminal for making that decision.''
   The Dukakis campaign was beginning its first nationwide
advertising with a new television ad beginning Tuesday night or
Wednesday, said Duncan, the Dukakis spokesman. Duncan said he
didn't know how much was spent on ads.
   The ``new era'' ad includes footage of Dukakis at the Democratic
convention and cites his record as governor of Massachusetts. It
has aired previously in California and Texas.
   Another set of ads sponsored by the Democratic National
Committee will begin airing Wenesday or Thursday hammering at the
theme that America cannot afford four more years of a Republican
administration and stressing the Dukakis campaign theme of
extending economic prosperity to the middle class. The campaign
also is beginning an advertisement in Texas on plant-closing
legislation.

   Dictator Josef Stalin went unattended by doctors
for at least 14 hours after he suffered a fatal stroke in 1953
because his security chief refused to let anyone summon physicians,
according to an Estonian newspaper.
   Sovietskaya Estonia said in an edition that arrived in Moscow
Tuesday that Stalin's bodyguards found him incapacitated on the
floor of his country residence but Lavrenti Beria insisted Stalin
was sleeping.
   No one dared contradict Beria and Stalin was left unattended
until the next day, the newspaper reported in its Sunday edition.
   Beria became head of the secret police in 1938 and carried out
bloody purges during the Stalin era.
   The newspaper said its report was based partly on an account
recently given to it by a retired security officer, A. T. Rykov,
who claimed he was present at Stalin's dacha, or country home, when
Stalin died.
   Stalin had ruled since 1924. Little official information was
given about his death in March 1953 and his final days have been a
mystery to historians.
   Sovietskaya Estonia gave this version:
   Stalin probably died several days before March 5, 1953, the day
his death was announced and that given officially as the date of
death.
   Stalin died at his dacha and not in the Kremlin, as official
reports said.
   An autopsy showed Stalin suffered a series of small strokes in
his final years that affected ``parts of the brain responsible for
psychotic activities.''
   It took more than six months to embalm and preserve the body
before it was put on public display.
   The newspaper said Rykov, who retired as a major, served as a
guard at Stalin's dacha and recently entered the paper's editorial
department and offered to tell his story.
   ``He could talk for hours about `the leader of the people,'
saving every little fact in his memory,'' the report said.
   It quoted Rykov was as saying Stalin went to bed at 4 a.m. on
March 1, 1953, after guests had left.
   ``In the afternoon guards noticed there was no movement in
Stalin's study or other rooms, but at 6:30 p.m. a light was turned
on in the study and in the hall,'' Rykov said, according to the
newspaper.
   It quoted him as saying no one summoned the guards, who became
concerned; when one went in to deliver a letter Stalin was lying on
the carpet in the dining room having ``obvious difficulties in
saying anything. Other guards came into the room and carried Stalin
into the largest hall. It could be seen that he was cold, and he
probably was on the floor three to four hours without any help.''
   The account said Beria and Georgi M. Malenkov, a close aide who
briefly succeeded Stalin as top leader, arrived at 3 a.m. on March
2 after Beria telephoned instructions that no one was to say
anything about Stalin's condition.
   After seeing the unconscious leader, Beria insisted the guards
had panicked and that ``Stalin was simply sleeping,'' according to
the report.
   Doctors finally were summoned, apparently by Nikita S.
Khrushchev who won a power struggle to become Communist Party chief
later in 1953, and they arrived between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
   ``The doctors were so nervous they could not even take off
Stalin's shirt,'' Rykov was quoted as saying. ``It had to be cut
through with scissors. The diagnosis was brain hemorrhage.
Treatment was attempted, but it was not surgical. What surgeon
could take responsibility for Stalin's life, especially when Beria
frightened everybody, asking whether they could guarantee that
Stalin's life could be preserved?''
   Beria was arrested in July 1953 and charged with conspiracy
against the state. After a secret trial he and six alleged
accomplices where shot in December 1953.
   The newspaper article described the evening of March 5, 1953,
when S.S. Debov, who had embalmed the body of Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin, was summoned.
   ``One of Stalin's cars took Debov to Stalin's postmortem
examination, which showed some irreversible changes localized in
parts of the brain responsible for psychotic activities, which were
caused by a number of small hemorrhages,'' Rykov said.
   Stalin's funeral was held on March 9 and the body carried to the
tomb. The mausoleum was closed for more than eight months for a
more permanent embalming procedure.
   ``On Nov. 17, 1953, the mausoleum was opened for the people with
Lenin and Stalin lying together,'' the newspaper said.
   It reported the identical coffins remained side by side until
8:25 p.m. on Oct. 31, 1961, when soldiers took Stalin's remains to
a plain gravesite nearby but outside the Kremlin wall.
   Khrushchev had begun his campaign against what he called the
cult of Stalin.

   Evangelist Billy Graham has been
hospitalized with a foot infection probably caused by a spider
bite, officials of his ministry said Tuesday.
   The 69-year-old evangelist, in western New York for a weeklong
crusade, was admitted to Rochester's Highland Hospital on Labor Day
and was told by doctors he must stay at least two days, said Graham
spokesman A. Larry Ross.
   ``He does have significant pain and swelling in his left foot
but it's a localized infection and doctors have assured him he will
be able to complete his schedule,'' Ross said.
   Ross said a doctor who examined Graham in North Carolina
theorized the evangelist had been bitten by a Brown Recluse spider.
Graham lives in a wooded area of the southern Appalachian Mountains.
   Graham is scheduled to begin an eight-day series of meetings in
Rochester on Sept. 11.

   Foreign ministers of nations that profess
non-alignment welcomed the world's improved political climate, but
were less optimistic Tuesday about its economic prospects.
   ``The international crisis still persists and a number of
economic and financial problems remain unresolved with prospects of
progress gloomy,'' spokesman Nicos Agathocleous said.
   A draft statement on the international economy will be presented
for approval to the four-day ministers' conference, which President
George Vassiliou of Cyprus will open Wednesday.
   Agathocleous said the draft statement emphasized that, though
there are political developments, particularly between the two
superpowers, offering new possibilities of strengthening
international cooperation, regrettably the same is not true about
the world economic situation.''
   A copy obtained by The Associated Press deals in detail with 30
issues, ranging from establishment of a new economic order to
foreign debt, world hunger, relations between rich and poor nations
and global economic cooperation.
   The draft ``expresses profound concern'' about lack of progress
on almost all issues covered.
   It says problems in the world economy and links between nations
make it ``all the more urgent that both the developed and the
developing countries engage in construtive dialogue.''
   This should be ``aimed at finding common solutions to the
problems currently confronting the international economy, including
the reform of the international monetary, financial and trading
systems in the interest of both the developed and the developing
countries,'' the draft declares.
   Another committee is considering a statement on 39 international
political issues, with emphasis on the Palestinian and South
African problems.
   Agathocleous said the 60-page political document, prepared by
Cyprus as the host country, is much shorter than drafts submitted
to previous conferences. Delegations from 92 out of non-aligned
movement's 101 members are to attend the four-day meting, including
70 foreign ministers.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which seeks to turn
sympathy for the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied lands to its political advantage, is expected to
win wide support and possibly financial backing.
   That would give a significant boost to PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat's effort to form a provisional government for an independent
Palestinian state.

   President Reagan accused the Democratic
White House ticket Tuesday of harboring ``a Disneyland defense
policy'' that would strip the nation of its military strength and
threaten the advances he has made in arms control.
   Acting as George Bush's chief surrogate on the campaign trail,
Reagan used some of his harshest rhetoric in weeks to lambast the
vice president's opponents in an address to the 70th national
convention of the American Legion.
   The president entered the post-Labor Day election fray during a
stop en route to Washington following a three-week California
vacation.
   Reagan never mentioned Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis by name, but he made clear he thinks the Massachusetts
governor embodies the ``liberal ideology of decline and retreat''
and leads a party that has shown ``remarkable passivity'' and
``unbelievable indecision'' in defense matters while it controlled
the White House.
   In doing so, the president attempted to paint Dukakis as
inexperienced in world and military affairs, while hoping to woo
into Bush's corner those conservative Democrats who twice had voted
for his own ``peace through strength'' stand.
   Using a comic-book analogy to make his point, Reagan quipped,
``When it comes to defense, the liberal agenda hides behind heroic
rhetoric. But this liberal agenda is no Superman; it's no Clark
Kent; it's Jimmy Olson trying to impress his date.''
   He charged the Democrats with promoting a ``hit list'' of
cancellations and delays for the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, the
Trident submarine missile and two proposed carrier battle groups
for the Navy.
   ``To that they've added nearly every major new weapons system to
become prominent on the scene since the last liberal administration
went to its reward, including the Midgetman missile, the Stealth
bomber and our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' Reagan said.
   Dukakis, however, has said he supports the advanced D-5 Trident
missile and continued development of the Stealth bomber, so-called
because of its ability to escape radar detection.
   The president accused the Democrats of planning to start ``a
unilateral U.S. moratorium on underground nuclear testing and a ban
on flight testing of missiles.''
   Reagan said that while Bush's opponents have praised him for
reaching a treaty with the Soviets banning intermediate-range
nuclear weapons in Europe, they also ``opposed deploying the
missiles that made that treaty possible ....''
   ``They want to conclude more arms reduction treaties, but would
cancel or delay the weapons systems on which successful
negotiations will depend. ... They profess their devotion to NATO
but would diminish the role of the very nuclear forces that NATO
needs to deter the Soviets. Does that make any sense as military
strategy?'' Reagan asked.
   ``Yes, it comes down to this: After eight hard years of
rebuilding America's strength, do we really want to return to a
Disneyland defense policy _ with Mickey Mouse treatment of our men
and women in uniform, Goofy strategic plans and Donald Duck-like
lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own
blankety-blank fault?'' Reagan asked.
   Reagan contended that even the Soviets might prefer his own
approach to that of any Democrat.
   ``Again and again around the world, our predecessors had shown
not the slightest grasp of the fundamentals of strategy and
national interest ... And it even came to be said that the Soviets
longed for strong, consistent leadership in the United States,
capable of making a deal and sticking to it,'' Reagan said.
   He derided Dukakis' proposals for boosting conventional forces,
which he has dubbed a ``conventional defense initiative,'' in
contrast to the president's anti-missile strategic defense program.
   Reagan contended a buildup of conventional forces is ``well
under way'' and that without the recent achievement of laser-guided
munitions, ``we would not have been able to stage our successful
strike against (Moammar) Gadhafi's Libya.''
   The president went on to boast how successful his policies have
been. ``And our reward is that from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf
to Southern Africa, we are bringing peace to long-raging conflicts,
even as we frustrate Soviet aims,'' he contended.
   Reagan repeated his oft-used claim that he's ``not given up one
square inch of land to communism ... And yet today relations
between the United States and the Soviet Union are the best they've
been in decades.''
   He told his audience, composed of some 7,000 veterans and their
families, that he was proud of the military buildup he'd pledged to
achieve eight years ago.
   ``Today I stand before you to report, `Mission accomplished,'''
he said.
   The Legionnaires interrupted the president frequently with
applause. However, on the sidewalk outside the convention hall,
about two dozen demonstrators held up signs urging support for the
Equal Rights Amendment and opposing the president's policy of aid
to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Before addressing the Legion, Reagan stopped briefing at
Nebraska's Hastings College, where he participated in dedication
ceremonies of a communications arts center.
   The center is named for the parents of public relations
executive Robert T. Gray, a former resident of Hastings and
long-time Reagan acquaintance who had served as the communications
director on the the president's 1980 White House campaign.

   President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday accused
Iran of starting the Persian Gulf war and stalling the cease-fire
talks in Geneva.
   Also Tuesday, the Iraqi government declared an amnesty for
anti-government Kurds and gave those outside the country 30 days to
return.
   The amnesty decree by the Revolutionary Command Council covered
``all Iraqi Kurds who have committed any crime punishable by law
whether they are outside or inside the country.''
   But a spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party, the main
guerrilla group, said it will not use the amnesty without
guarantees that prisoners will be released and returnees will be
allowed to resettle in their original villages.
   ``This amnesty has come too late,'' said the spokesman in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press in Cyprus. ``When
people have lost their homes or their villages or their sons in
these chemical bombardments, what would they accept an amnesty
for?''
   Kurdish rebels have charged that Iraq, after the start of the
Aug. 20 cease-fire with Iran, launched a massive assault on the
Kurdish population in northern Iraq, using chemical weapons and
60,000 troops. The Kurds, backed by Iran, have been seeking an
autonomous homeland that area of Iraq.
   Hussein referred briefly to the offensive, saying the operation
was over.
   In his first major public speech since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in
the gulf, Hussein said Iraq has proof that Iran started the
hostilities. His address to a conference of Arab information
ministers was broadcast on state-run television.
   ``Now I can reveal for the first time that we have Iranian
pilots who were downed by Iraq before September 4, 1980,'' he said.
   Iran claims the war began on September 22 of that year when Iraq
launched a massive invasion. Iraq claims the war began on Sept. 4,
when Iran shelled Iraqi towns and attacked Iraqi ships in the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   U.N.-mediated peace talks in Geneva have stalled, in part over
Iraq's demand the waterway, its only outlet to the sea, be opened
and cleared of sunken tankers. Hussein insisted that Iran is
preventing progress at the talks.
   ``We did not ask for something unrealistic,'' he said. ``What we
asked for is free navigation in the gulf and Shatt-al-Arab.''
   The Shatt-al-Arab waterway, formed by the convergence of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is located on the southern border
between the two nations and is the the source of a 400-year-old
dispute between Iran and Iraq.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
on Tuesday the United States is ``very concerned about the human
rights implications of Iraq's conduct toward civilians, and its
campaign to suppress longstanding Kurdish rebellions.'' He said,
however, America had no evidence Iraq was engaged in chemical
warfare against the Kurds.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
was grounded Tuesday and had to cancel an Ohio campaign stop after
the Federal Aviation Administration sprung a surprise inspection of
his chartered airplane and found safety problems with it.
   Dukakis spent much of Tuesday afternoon at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. He canceled a trip to Columbus, Ohio, and
returned to Boston on the press plane that accompanies his campaign.
   After landing in Boston, Dukakis told reporters that the timing
of the FAA's spot inspection ``was very curious,'' but declined to
comment further.
   Campaign press secretary Dayton Duncan said the inspection could
have been performed overnight and added, ``we're looking forward to
the moment in January when he gets to name the FAA administrator.''
   The misfortunes with campaign aircraft continued despite the
grounding. As s reporters and staff disembarked from the media
plane, a cone-shaped section at the rear fell to the ground,
exposing the open cabin inside.
   The plane's pilot, who had invited Dukakis to sit in the jump
seat of the cockpit during the landing, blamed the mishap on
someone inside the plane who he said pulled a cable jettisoning the
tail cone.
   The pilot, who declined to give his name, said the tail cone
could not have come off during an actual flight.
   The Boeing 737 that the candidate and his campaign staff had
been using was taken out of service by Presidential Airways after
an FAA inspector cited at least four problems with it.
   Joan Fudala, a spokeswoman for Presidential Airways, called the
problems ``a couple of minor items'' that were corrected during the
day. She said the plane was expected to fly to Boston and rejoin
the Dukakis campaign.
   The FAA said it did not actually ground the jet, but pointed out
the problems _ including eight inches of peeling metal skin on a
wing flap and a cabin door that would not seal properly.
   ``The captain elected to delay the flight so those could be
fixed,'' said Ms. Fudala from the airline's headquarters in
Herndon, Va.
   The FAA called the inspection routine, but Duncan questioned why
the aircraft, which had been at O'Hare since Monday, could not have
been examined earlier.
   ``Our plane has been parked here since last night and surely if
our plane needed to be inspected it would have been more convenient
for us to have it done last night, not 15 minutes before we were
supposed to leave,'' he said.
   He said the campaign had been told that the order to inspect the
plane came from officials at the FAA's regional office in Chicago.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman at the regional FAA office, said the
agency ``is inspecting all candidate and press planes once every
two weeks on average.''
   In Washington, FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the ``ramp''
inspection, which consists of close visual inspection of the
exterior and interior of the aircraft, was similar to those
conducted in recent weeks on other planes chartered by the two
presidential candidates.
   He said that between Aug. 23 and Aug. 26 the FAA inspected two
aircraft belonging to the Dukakis campaign and three hired by the
Bush campaign including one carrying GOP vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle. Bush travels on Air Force Two, which is
closely inspected by the military.
   ``These were all ramp inspections. It is part of a deliberate
program to keep close tabs on the safety of aircraft used by the
political candidates,'' said Farrar.
   According to the FAA, the problems found on the Presidential
Airways jet were: a delamination of metal skin on a wing flap; a
bent stall-warning vane, the device that measures wind flow and
triggers a warning if the aircraft is about to stall;
pressurization problems with the left-front cabin door, and
improperly working floor proximity lights.

   Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis' lead over Republican George Bush narrowed sharply
from May to August, according to results of a poll of potential
voters in Rhode Island released Tuesday.
   Most of the previous Dukakis supporters shifted to the undecided
column and Bush picked up little of that support, according to the
poll released by WJAR-TV and Alpha Research Associates Inc.
   Dukakis held a 49 percent lead to Bush's 32 percent when 509
registered voters were interviewed in August. But when those same
potential voters were interviewed in May, the governor of the
neighboring state of Massachusetts held a 58 percent lead to Bush's
31 percent, according to WJAR.
   At the same time, the percentage of those undecided increased
from 10 percent to 20 percent.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage
points.

   Eastern Airlines' unions will argue their case
against the carrier's elimination of 4,000 jobs in federal court
this month, but employees Tuesday began receiving pink slips.
   An Eastern spokeswoman said the post-Labor Day layoffs aren't as
dramatic as portrayed by union leaders. Karen Ceremsak said many
employees already have taken leaves of absences, early retirement
or quit.
   Attorneys for the Machinists union and Air Line Pilots
Association decided to first present their case against the layoffs
in the appellate court.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Tuesday told Eastern
to submit legal briefs on its position by Sept. 12. A union
response is due by Sept. 16, a reply from Eastern is due three days
later, and oral arguments in the case were scheduled for the
morning of Sept. 26, Ms. Ceremsak said.
   The same court last Friday night dissolved an order by U.S.
District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington, D.C. Parker had
allowed Eastern to cut 12 percent of its flights, including all
service for 14 cities, but not lay off the workers.
   The appellate court allowed Eastern to make the layoffs after
posting a $4.7 million bond to pay the employees if their jobs are
reinstated after the court holds a full hearing. The company says
the layoffs take effect Sept. 10.
   Charles Bryan, president of Eastern's Machinists union, has
blasted the timing of the layoffs.
   ``It is typical of (Texas Air Chairman) Frank Lorenzo's style,''
Bryan said. ``It's tragic for the employees to be faced with this
kind of uncertainty on Labor Day and at the start of the school
year.''
   But Ceremsak said, ``There's no good time for a furlough. We had
previously announced the furloughs July 22. It was the unions'
court action that delayed them.''
   She said of 1,000 flight attendant positions eliminated, nearly
400 flight attendants had taken leaves of absences that would last
from one to six months, about 100 had taken early retirement or
quit, and some 530 were furloughed.
   Of the 4,000 positions eliminated, 1,500 were non-union
employees including management and clerical workers. Some 1,000
Machinists workers, which include mechanics, baggage handlers and
ramp agents, will be laid off. Some of those workers will take
early retirement, Eastern officials expected.
   The layoffs also called for elimination of 500 pilots'
positions, but ALPA spokesman Ron Cole said no pilot layoffs were
expected because of tremendous backlogs of vacation time.
   The Miami-based carrier has said cutting labor costs is
necessary to make the company profitable again, but unions have
criticized the idea that scaling back will make the airline more
money.
   Eastern officials say they want to concentrate on their
traditionally strong Northeastern markets. But the unions contend
that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, is stripping the
Miami-based carrier's assets in favor of its non-union sister
carrier, Continental Airlines.

<TEXT>
   City officials paid a $192,000 fine Tuesday
and, faced with million-dollar fines by the end of the week,
pressed their efforts to end an impasse over court-ordered housing
desegregation.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko told reporters it was possible that at
least one of the four city councilmen blocking the housing plan may
be near backing down.
   But later he said the prospects for a quick settlement did not
appear good.
   ``I'm sorry to report that there hasn't been any significant
movement,'' he said. ``The court is standing firm but the
councilmen say they want some concessions before they comply. The
two sides are considerably far apart.''
   Wasicsko said Councilmen Nicholas Longo and Peter Chema met with
him and the city manager for 7{ hours Monday talking about services
that would have to be cut to meet mounting fines.
   He noted that Chema represents an area of the city ``that is
going to feel the brunt of the service cuts and tax increases very
acutely, and yet that is an area where no housing is to be built.''
It is the proposed placement of subsidized housing in middle-class
areas that fueled opposition to the plan.
   No meetings were scheduled Tuesday, but key figures in the
crisis of the state's fourth-largest city were in touch by
telephone.
   The mayor said he was in contact most of the day with City
Council members, with the federal judge in the case and aides to
Gov. Mario Cuomo in Albany.
   No breakthrough was reported from Monday's meetings.
   According to city Corporation Counsel Paul Pickelle, U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand had said that if the City Council
approved a housing plan Tuesday, he would forgive the $192,000 in
fines accumulated over the weekend.
   Pickelle said there was ``a real financial incentive to reach a
compromise today.''
   But Yonkers spokesman Eric Schoen said 12 hours notice is
required before a legal meeting, and none was scheduled as of
Tuesday morning.
   At issue is Sand's order that the council approve measures to
promote the construction of 800 units of subsidized housing.
   Sand ruled in 1985 that the city was guilty of decades of
intentional segregation of its schools and public housing.
   The schools were desegregated under a plan approved by Sand, and
the City Council agreed in January to develop 1,000 units of
housing.
   But under pressure from people who don't want subsidized housing
in their middle-class neighborhoods, four councilmen recanted and
vowed to block the plan from going forward.
   Sand levied escalating fines against the city _ $100 for the
first day and doubling every day after that. He also fined the
recalcitrant councilmen.
   The penalties were stayed pending appeal. Last week, the U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated the fines against the city but continued
the stay against any punishment of the councilmen.
   If the fines continue mounting through the week, Yonkers would
owe $204,800 Wednesday. By Friday, the fines would reach $1 million
a day; the city would be bankrupt by Nov. 12, according to city
officials.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, the city announced details of a ``doomsday
budget'' made necessary by the fines.
   The plan forsees a gradual reduction in city services, such as
garbage collection, park maintenance and programs for senior
citizens, youths and the handicapped. Cuts would continue until
Thanksgiving, when all fire and police personnel would have been
laid off, garbage collection would end and the city would cease to
function.
   The mayor said that although formal cuts had not begun, 25
percent of Yonkers' scheduled garbage pickups were canceled Tuesday
because of a lack of diesel fuel as the city limits fuel purchases.
   ``The garbage is piling up today, the libraries will be closed
next week,'' the mayor said. ``It may take deep cuts in city
services to get the people of Yonkers to tell their councilmen that
they want this matter settled.''

<TEXT>
   Liberia has charged two Americans with
treason for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government and kill
President Samuel K. Doe. One of the defendants is a former U.S.
Army sergeant.
   An indictment was returned Monday against the ex-serviceman,
James Henry Bush, 40, of Baltimore, and Curtis Elmer Williams, 45,
of Jersey City, N.J..
   Also charged in the indictment was Mike Jackson, a Liberian who
lived in exile in neighboring Ivory Coast until his arrest in July.
   The three are charged with illegally entering Liberia in July
with the intent of staging a coup and killing Doe.
   Williams' wife, Gwendolyn, said her husband was in the business
of importing cement to Liberia and planned no wrongdoing when he
traveled to the country.
   ``I feel that he's innocent because when he left here, he left
on business,'' Mrs. Williams, 30, told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from her home in Jersey City. ``They happened
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
   Williams' name was given as William Elmer Curtis, but Mrs.
Williams said that was an error.
   Five members of the purported coup plot were killed in a July 13
clash with Liberian security men, including Liberian Maj. Gen. J.
Nicholas Podier, Doe's former deputy and the plot's reported
mastermind, the indictment says.
   The document identifies the others killed as ex-soldier Humphrey
Moore and John Seekie, both Liberians. The indictment gave no
details on Seekie and said the other two dead men have not been
identified.
   The government said the coup plotters entered Liberia from the
Ivory Coast on July 10 near the village of Gbolay.
   They reportedly hid for three days in a forest, but were
discovered by security forces on July 13 and a firefight ensued.
   ``The three defendants were overpowered while Podier, Moore and
John Seekie and two others presently unknown were killed as a
result of the gunfire,'' the indictment said.
   Liberia was established in 1847 by former American slaves.
   Doe, then an army master sergeant, took power in an April 12,
1980 coup, overthrowing the government of William Tolbert and
killing the civilian leader.

<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday acquitted a teen-ager who
was in a fatal car accident during a driver education course and
criticized her instruction, which included the showing of a Richard
Pryor movie.
   Lorain County Juvenile Court Judge Henry Webber said Michelle
Moore, 18, of Elyria was innocent of vehicular homicide. He said
she was poorly trained and did not receive proper instruction at
the time of the accident.
   Miss Moore was 17 at the time of the Jan. 23 accident that
killed Donald Mussey, 75, of Elyria. She was taking a class from
the Pro Driving School of Elyria.
   She was in tears when the verdict was announced and hugged her
parents, Oliver and Arlene. ``We've been living with this for nine
months,'' Oliver Moore said. ``I'm so relieved it's hard to have
any words to say.''
   In his decision, Webber said, ``I find it sad that young people
paying good money to learn to drive would get to see a movie such
as `Jo Jo Dancer, (Your Life is Calling)' instead of instruction on
driving.''
   The judge said Ms. Moore hadn't been prepared to drive in poor
road conditions when her driver's education car slid on a snowy
road and crossed into the opposite lane, striking the car in which
Mussey was riding.
   Miss Moore had testified during her trial last month that the
movie was shown during her first driver education class. The movie
was inspired by the comedian's life, particularly events that
followed a 1980 incident in which he set himself on fire while
smoking cocaine.
   Classroom instructor James Myrick testified during the trial
that about 15 minutes of the Pryor movie was shown, but Miss Moore
said she saw about 45 minutes of the film before being pulled out
of class to practice maneuverability skills in a parking lot.
   Witnesses for Pro Driving School never explained why the movie
was shown.
   Paul St. Marie, the teen-ager's attorney, said the movie had no
place in a drivers' training class. ``It has no redeeming value
whatsoever as far as safe driving is concerned,'' he said. ``It was
clearly meant as entertainment.''
   Pro Driving School referred a call to attorney Gerald Smith of
Elyria, who said the accident wasn't the school's fault.
   ``You're going to have to learn to drive, and you're going to
have to do it on the highway,'' Smith said. ``So it's not a matter

   Lorain County Prosecutor Greg White said he would review the
trial transcript and evidence to determine whether the driver's
education school or instructor would be criminally liable in
Mussey's death.

   Three unarmed IRA guerrillas who were killed by
British soldiers in Gibraltar six months ago were shot at least
eight times each, a police photographer testified at an inquest
Tuesday.
   The testimony came at the opening of the inquest, which will
determine whether the deaths can be legally justified.
   Coroner Felix Pizzarello began the session by denying a motion
to eliminate the 11-member jury from the inquest on the grounds
that publicity about the killings had favored the British soldiers
who fired on the guerrillas.
   Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann, who the IRA has
admitted were on a mission at the time of their deaths, were shot
and killed by seven soldiers near a gas station in the British
colony of Gibraltar on March 6.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
claim the killings were part of an unofficial ``shoot-to-kill''
policy against members of the Irish Republican Army. British
authorities said the three men were planning a car bomb attack at
the site where the Royal Anglian Regiment band accompanies a weekly
changing of the guard ceremony.
   The police photographer who testified Tuesday, Brian Reyes, said
that Farrell, Savage and McMann were each shot at least eight
times. He identified black-and-white photographs he took showing
the bullet entry and exit wounds.
   Reyes said Savage was hit with bullets in the head, hand, arms,
side and chest; McCann in the head, torso, thigh, stomach and
chest; and Farrell in the face, side and chest just below the heart.
   Patrick McGrory, a Belfast lawyer representing the families of
the dead, argued that the jurors should not participate in the
hearings because they would be influenced by British press coverage
of the shootings. He said reports favored the members of the
Special Air Service unit who did the shooting.
   The day after the slayings, British Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe told Parliament in London that the three IRA suspects
were unarmed.
   McGrory is expected to question witnesses who say the three men
were given no chance to surrender before the soldiers shot them.
   After the shooting, police found a rented car parked near the
area where the ceremony of the guards took place. Authorities said
they first believed it had been rigged as a car bomb. A second
rented car containing timing devices and wire was found on the
Spanish side of the border from Gibraltar.
   Two days after the shootings, Spanish police found a third car
packed with explosives in a garage in Marbella on the Spanish coast.
   If the inquest's jury decides the British soldiers acted in an
unlawful manner, the soldiers may be criminally indicted under
British law.
   Michael Hucker, who represents the soldiers referred to only as
``soldiers A to G,'' said his clients were prepared to testify at
the hearing, but only if reporters and the public are excluded and
their voices electronically altered. Pizzarello said the inquest,
which is taking place in the Supreme Court building, would last
about four weeks.
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic IRA seeks to oust British
troops from mainly Protestant Northern Ireland and to unite it with
the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   West German officials want to
take over part of a key U.S. air base near Frankfurt to enlarge the
city's commercial airport, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   The report added to growing speculation about the future of the
Rhein-Main Air Base that adjoins Frankfurt international airport.
   Hesse state wants 20 percent of the 776-acre Air Force base to
enlarge passenger facilities at the Frankfurt airport, according to
the Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper. It quoted Hesse Economics
Minister Alfred Schmidt.
   The Rhein-Main base, which U.S. forces in Germany refer to as
the ``Gateway to Europe,'' has been the site of historic events.
   In January 1981 the 52 Americans who had been held hostage in
the U.S. Embassy in Iran arrived at the base and in 1985 Vice
President George Bush greeted the 39 Americans flown there after
they were released by the hijackers of a TWA jetliner.
   Rhine-Main was a major base for the Berlin Airlift in 1948, when
planes delivered thousands of tons of food, fuel and clothing to
West Berlin after Soviet forces blockaded the city.
   There have been heated discussions in West Germany in recent
months about how to cope with overcrowded skies and airports that
are causing flight delays and cancellations.
   A large number of air corridors over West Germany and numerous
air bases are reserved for North Atlantic Treaty Organization
forces.
   The U.S. military took over the Rhein-Main base after World War
II.
   Hesse Gov. Walter Wallmann on Tuesday denied reports that the
state is planning to buy and take over all of the air base.
   Hessischer Rundfunk radio last Friday reported that West German
officials had offered about $128 million for the entire Rhine-Main
site.
   ``These reports come out of thin air,'' Wallmann told reporters
in the state capital of Wiesbaden. ``We are speaking with U.S.
armed forces about how to ensure the position of the Frankfurt
airport in the face of increasing air travel.''
   Frankfurt's commercial airport and the U.S. Air Force share use
of the runways at the site, six miles south of Frankfurt.
   U.S. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Pat Maloney, contacted by The
Associated Press by telephone at at his Rhein-Main office, said,
``There is nothing being discussed at this level.'' U.S. Embassy
spokesman Robert Heath would say only that the reports about the
base were ``hypothetical.''
   The Rhein-Main base has been used mainly by the U.S. Air Force's
Military Airlift Command to transport military personnel to and
from Europe.

   Rock star Elton John threw a high-class garage
sale of his treasures at the world's richest art auction house
Tuesday and cleared nearly $2 million on the first day.
   Sotheby's, the auctioneers, said the opening batch of
memorabilia fetched double their estimated worth, and an evening
sale of mostly art deco jewelry also fetched more.
   ``I'm absolutely thrilled,'' John said in the United States
after hearing the result of the sale, Sotheby's reported.
   Three more days of sales will see off John's art collection,
antiques and furniture.
   The gemstuff on Tuesday sold for $1.2 million _ $200,000 over
estimate _ to make a total for the day of $1,975,290.
   After the daytime rock fans, a smart evening crowd _ but lacking
celebrities _ crowded in to watch glamorous models showing off
rings, bracelets, brooches and pendants worn by John. There were
also boxes and miniature clocks by famous makers like Faberge and
Cartier.
   Top price of the evening was $42,700 paid by Seibu, a Japanese
department store for a Cartier 1923 emerald, onyx and diamond lapel
watch.
   John, 41, who says he has run out of room for new things at his
mansion, was in Miami, preparing a U.S. tour. But plenty of fans
turned up to bid for his glitzy eyeglasses, zany hats and costumes,
diamante-soled platform shoes, pinball machines, Rembrandt etchings
and jukeboxes.
   Prices soared two, three and four times above estimate for items
some art critics have dismissed as junk.
   ``Buyers were coming out of the woodwork _ most of them we had
never heard of,'' said Sotheby's spokeswoman Susy Robinson.
   The top price of the day was $29,744 for a Wurlitzer jukebox
made in 1940 and originally offered for $11,830.
   A camisole worn by Judy Garland in the movie ``Meet Me in St.
Louis'' sold for $3,346, more than three times the top estimate.
   Three signed photographs of the American Apollo 15 astronauts
dedicated to the ``Rocket Man,'' one of John's biggest hits, sold
for $3,350, when only $300 had been expected.
   The outrageous eyeglasses of the pianist-singer-composer were
the biggest draw. And the biggest buyer appeared to be Warwick
Stone, bidding by telephone from Los Angeles, who spent about
$118,000 on items for his Hard Rock Cafe.
   The restaurant chain paid the top price of $5,948 for a pair of
glasses with blue and yellow lenses in mother-of-pearl frames
embelished with rhinestones.
   Stone also bought platform boots, a presentation gold disc and a
boater with a model of the Eiffel Tower in Paris on top.
   The 54-inch-high fiberglass boots worn by John as the Pinball
Wizard in the rock movie ``Tommy'' went to British businessman
Stephen Griggs for $20,200.
   ``We thought they would be the ideal thing for the company to
use in exhibitions,'' said Griggs, a boot and shoemaker.
   An ordinary straw boater of John's from Dobbs of Fifth Avenue,
size 7[ inches, sold for $1,400.
   Shirley Cowdrey, a British fan, said after paying $8,900 for the
rock star's ``Yellow Brick Road'' cream canvas stage suit,
embroidered with album song titles: ``This costume is so Elton John
I just had to have it. I'll wear it myself if it fits.''
   The first of the 290 lots to go was a pencil sketch of comedians
Laurel and Hardy, which went for $1,100, against an estimate of
$670.
   ``I knew then it was going to be a good day,'' said auctioneer
Hilary Kay, who was on the rostrum for more than five hours, while
the sale raked in $711,803.
   ``It's all such fun. It's attracting interest from people who
have never dreamed of going to a sale before,'' said Marcus Linell,
the Sotheby's director who organized the auction.
   But arts reporter Godfrey Barker of London's Daily Telegraph
sniffed that Sotheby's ``looks more like a Miami Beach department
store than an art auction house... Art as excellence is quite
demode.''

<HEAD>Escalating Postal Strike Puts More Than Letters in a Bind</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment checks, last-minute college
placements and letters to the editor disappeared into mountains of
unsorted mail Tuesday as Britain's postal strike escalated.
   With the nationwide strike in its seventh day, 80 million
letters and parcels were held up in darkened post offices.
Deliveries in London were at a virtual halt. All 11,000 mailboxes
in the capital were sealed.
   Private couriers rejoiced, but postal customers scrambled to
find alternative ways to deliver their messages, money or bills.
   The government hired a private courier company to deliver
unemployment checks.
   The Times, Daily Telegraph and Independent invited readers to
send letters to the editor by Fax machine.
   ``Any system which relies on the post must be in difficulties at
a time like this,'' said Mike Hiscock, head of administration at
the Universities Central Council on Admissions.
   The council, an intermediary between universities and their
applicants, set up telephone banks to help match students rejected
elsewhere with schools that had openings.
   Hiscock estimated up to one-third of the annual 15,000
last-minute applications were caught in the backlog.
   The dispute over regional pay differences and the use of
temporary workers shut down 60 of the country's 80 main sorting
offices by Tuesday, said Sally Williams, a post office spokeswoman.
   The service has 180,000 workers.
   Ms. Williams said that 70,000 workers involved in sorting and
delivery stayed away, up from 48,000 Monday.
   About 15 million letters, compared with a daily 51 million, were
being delivered, she said. Earlier estimates said 100 million items
were backlogged, but Ms. Williams put the figure at 80 million.
   Talks on renewing negotiations continued between the Post Office
and the Union of Communication Workers but no details were
disclosed.
   TNT Express U.K., which claims to be Britain's largest courier,
said it has experienced a 400 percent increase in business since
the strike began Wednesday.
   Patience wore thin among postal consumers.
   ``Business has increased, but in some respects it's holding us
back,'' said Alan Dickinson, sales manager at a London store. ``We
can't complete deliveries until we get confirmation. We also can't
get invoices out, so we can't get paid.''
   ``Many firms are experiencing considerable disruption,
frustration and annoyance through this unnecessary strike,'' said
Ron Taylor, director general of the Association of British Chambers
of Commerce, which represents 65,000 businesses.
   A statement issued by three large mail order and direct
marketing groups demanded that the strike end.

   A burning building collapsed on
firefighters battling a suspicious fire Tuesday, killing one and
injuring three others, authorities said.
   The fire in two adjoining buildings broke out at 2:12 p.m.,
sending dense smoke throughout the downtown area for several hours.
One of the buildings was vacant and the other housed a clothing
store.
   It was the second major fire in the area in five days. On
Thursday, a fire destroyed three downtown buildings.
   The roof and second floor of one of the buildings collapsed at
4:30 p.m., trapping three firefighters. Two were removed within 20
minutes, but rescuers with power saws worked more than an hour to
reach the third.
   Firefighter Tracy Williamson, 23, was pronounced dead at Pontiac
Osteopathic Hospital, said Dr. Bob Aranosian, director of the
hospital's Emergency Trauma Center.
   Two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation, and a fourth
firefighter was in serious but stable condition, Aranosian said.
   The cause of the fire was undetermined, but ``at any time like
this it would be considered a suspicious fire,'' said Assistant
Fire Chief Ronald Rayner.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Resigns Over Passport Snafu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Willem van
Eekelen announced his resignation Tuesday after allegations that he
bungled the introduction of a new passport system.
   ``I have asked her majesty the queen (Beatrix) to allow me to
resign,'' van Eekelen told Parliament. His action marked the first
such resignation from Premier Ruud Lubbers' coalition government of
centrist Christian Democrats and rightist Liberals since it came to
power in 1982.
   Van Eekelen's decision came after a parliamentary inquiry
committee said earlier this month that he had mismanaged the
passport project during his 1982-1986 tenure as a deputy foreign
minister.
   ``A minister of defense should defend himself to the utmost but
also limit casualties,'' he told Parliament.
   There was no immediate indication who would succeed the
57-year-old defense minister.
   The overhaul of the passport system has been beset by
controversy since its announcement in 1982. The new document was
supposed to be more forgery proof than the current passport and
bring this nation into line with passport requirements set by the
European Economic Community.
   The parliamentary report said van Eekelen had granted the
documents to develop and produce new passports to a newly formed
conglomerate without seriously considering rival bids from other
companies.
   It contained no charges of corruption against van Eekelen who
was appointed defense minister after the 1986 general elections.

   Police who had been held at bay for nine hours
Tuesday by a rain of shotgun pellets returned fire and mortally
wounded the sniper through his door, then found his two children
dead in their high-rise apartment.
   The siege left 14 officers injured, but all were treated and
released, officials at two hospitals said.
   Cho Mun Chu, 45, who was removed from his city-subsidized Lower
East Side apartment on a stretcher, died later at Bellevue
Hospital, said Sgt. John Clifford, a police spokesman.
   The bodies of 8-year-old Helen Chu and her 9-year-old brother
Warren Chu, were found with wounds to the head, covered with
blankets and pillows in the hallway of apartment, police said.
   They were shot with what was believed to be a long-barrel
shotgun filled with bird shot, said police spokesman Lt. Steven
Davis.
   The girl's death was believed to be the first time in the
15-year history of the elite police Hostage Negotiating Unit that a
hostage was lost during negotiations, said another police
spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Police believe the boy was already dead when they arrived, but
the girl was seen alive by a police camara, Commissioner Benjamin
Ward said.
   Chu's wife, Hui Choy Chu, who also used the name Angela, was
believed to be in Taiwan, said O'Donnell.
   Ward said police were forced to shoot Chu in self-defense after
removing the door to his 11th-floor apartment from its hinges in an
attempt to bring the girl to safety.
   ``We waited until he fired point-blank _ one captain was hit,
four lieutenants were hit, and one police officer was hit by
pellets, and he was now firing point blank at the door,'' the
commissioner said.
   The officers returned two shots, hitting Chu twice in the chest,
Ward said.
   First Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Condon said earlier
that ``a rain of pellets'' descended on officers who arrived about
6 a.m. to investigate a report of shots fired.
   Scores of police then cordoned off a four-block area around the
building. The FDR Drive, a main highway along the East River into
Manhattan, was closed in both directions near the Brooklyn Bridge,
creating enormous traffic jams.
   For about a half-hour as the incident ended shortly after 3
p.m., the East River was closed to marine traffic between the
Williamsburg and Brooklyn bridges, said a Coast Guard spokesman,
Petty Officer Randy Midgett.
   Police attempts to communicate with the suspected sniper were
unsuccessful until a Cantonese-speaking detective was brought in to
act as interpreter.
   Condon said negotiations were difficult because the interpreter
and suspect were shouting through a door, which was locked and
barricaded by furniture.
   Police had said the man had made no threats against his family,
and in the course of negotiations had made no demands.
   ``He seems to have some kind of financial problems and family
problems and that seems to be what has set him off,'' Condon said.
   Victoria Parker, who lives on the 18th floor of the building,
said the man recently moved in and quickly gained a reputation for
having a bad temper. ``He gets into it with management and the
tenants,'' she said.
   Davis said Housing Authority police had been called to the
25-story building before because of problems with the man.

   An 11-year-old English boy crawled ashore
at Shakespeare Beach on Tuesday and set a new record as the
youngest person to swim the English Channel, the Channel Swimming
Association said.
   Thomas Gregory, age 11 years and 333 days, broke the record set
in 1979 when Marcus Hooper made the crossing at age 12 years, 53
days.
   Both boys belonged to the Eltham Swimming and Training Club of
London, 78 miles northwest of Dover.
   ``All I want to do is have a 48-hour kip (sleep),'' Gregory said
as he came ashore at 5 p.m. (noon EDT), 11 hours, 45 minutes after
setting out from Cape Gris-Nez, France.
   Gregory surpassed Hooper's time of 14 hours, 37 minutes, said
association secretary Audrey Scott.
   The boy made his crossing two weeks after Brazilian Renata
Camara Agondi, 20, died during a bid to conquer the 21 miles of
water separating England and France.
   The boy's parents, Nick and Mary Gregory, met him as he arrived
exhausted on the Dover beach. Also on the scene was his sister,
Anna, who has swum the channel three times on six-person relay
teams for the Eltham club.
   ``We are delighted with his efforts,'' said Mrs. Gregory, who
allowed her son to take the day off from school to make the swim.
``It's made all the training worthwhile.''
   Also on Tuesday, Tony Hogendorp, a native of Edmonton, Alberta,
failed in his attempt to swim the channel, abandoning the attempt
about five miles from France. The 22-year-old, a soldier with the
Royal Canadian Horse Artillery based in West Germany, ``just ran
out of gas,'' said his coach, Jim Ritchie.
   Mrs. Gregory said her son Thomas started swimming at the age of
three and began serious training for a channel swim when he was
seven, In 1987, he was able to swim the 10-mile length of Lake
Windermere in northwest England.
   The water stayed flat on Tuesday in ideal, wind-free, sunny
weather, said a spokesman for the coast guard in Dover.
   The youngest girl to swim the channel was Samantha Clare Druce,
also British, who was 12 years, 119 days old when she swam from
England to France in 15 hours, 27 minutes, according to the
Guinness Book of World Records.

<TEXT>
   Wind-whipped forest blazes across Montana
prompted a ban Tuesday on all outdoor recreation on state and
federal lands outside cities and towns, Gov. Ted Schwinden and
federal agencies said.
   The ban imposed by Schwinden, the U.S. Forest Service and the
Bureau of Land Management applies to all state and federal land,
including all rivers and streams, outside cities, towns and
national parks, the governor said.
   It affects all non-essential activities such as sightseeing,
hunting, fishing, boating, rafting, camping, hiking, picnicking and
wood-gathering.
   Farm work, livestock herding, house-building, mining and logging
are allowed. However, Schwinden warned that these activities could
be banned unless the fire danger wanes.
   Schwinden said the ban will remain until weather conditions ease
the fire danger and that probably will require a substantial amount
of rain.
   The ban came less than a week after the state Fish and Game
Commission delayed start of the 1988 hunting season, followed by a
plea from Schwinden for Montanans to stay out of the forests over
the Labor Day weekend.
   For the most part, Schwinden said, his request worked. Although
there were 58 new fires started in the state since his Aug. 31
statement, none developed into a major blaze, he said.
   The ban on recreation will be enforced by personnel from the
Forest Service, BLM, state wildlife agency and the state Lands
Department.
   Schwinden said violators probably will be warned first before
being cited.
   Brubaker said the Bureau of Indian Affairs has endorsed the ban
and it may be extended to Montana's seven Indian reservations after
the various tribal councils are consulted.
   Glacier and Yellowstone national parks were excluded from the
ban because the Park Service has its own restrictions on recreation
already in place, said John North, attorney for Schwinden.
   Fishing guides in Ennis, Helena and Great Falls complained that
the ban on floating and angling puts them out of business.
   ``Banning fishing is ridiculous,'' said Joel Weimer, owner of
Helena's Montana Fly Goods. ``It makes sense to ban fires, smoking
and off-road driving, but fishing? All I do is put a raft in the
Missouri River from a blacktopped road.''

   Two cosmonauts returned safely to Earth early
Wednesday after their descent was aborted twice because of a system
malfunction and their food and oxygen began to run out, the
official Soviet news agency reported.
   Tass reported that Abdul Ahad Mohmand, the first Afghan in
space, and his Soviet crewmate, Vladimir Lyakhov, touched down at
4:50 a.m. Moscow time (8:50 p.m. EDT Tuesday) in Soviet Central
Asia.
   ``Both cosmonauts feel fine after the landing,'' Tass said.
   The agency said their Soyuz TM-5 space capsule landed 99 miles
southeast of Dzhezkazgan, a town on the steppes of the republic of
Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia. The town is about 1,365 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   Soviet news reports earlier had said neither cosmonaut was in
immediate danger but that the situation soon could become critical.
   ``Accident! The engine worked 60 seconds and shut off. A
violation of the stabilization regime,'' Lyakhov told mission
control in an exchange reported by the government newspaper
Izvestia.
   Lyakhov, 47, is a military pilot who has flown in space twice
before, and Mohmand, 29, is an Afghan air force pilot.
   Lyakhov, Mohmand and Soviet doctor Valery Polyakov were launched
into space Aug. 29 and boarded the orbiting Mir space station two
days later. Polyakov remained aboard, but Lyakhov and Mohmand
undocked the Soyuz at 2:55 a.m. Moscow time (6:55 p.m. Monday EDT)
for the trip home.
   Polyakov stayed on the Mir to monitor the health of two other
cosmonauts who have been in space for more than eight months.
   James Oberg, a U.S. expert on the Soviet space program who is
familiar with the Soyuz TM-5 design, had said Tuesday that time was
running out.
   ``If they cannot make the burn tonight to push them back into
the atmosphere, they will probably only live another 24 to 48 hours
before the carbon dioxide building in the capsule will kill them,''
Oberg said in an interview with The Associated Press in Houston.
   Officials of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said NASA volunteered help but the Soviets declined,
saying ``they had a technical problem, but that no assistance was
needed.''
   The North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado said
the Soyuz had split into at least two parts, a normal procedure for
re-entry.
   ``We are tracking two pieces associated with TM-5,'' said Maj.
Alex Mondragon, a NORAD spokesman. The capsule was in an orbit 226
miles by 206 miles and the ship's living compartment was circling
Earth 234 miles at the highest point and 155 miles at the lowest.
   The Soyuz capsule is designed for trips to and from space, not
for long flights.
   Izvestia and Tass earlier reported that life support systems on
the globe-shaped capsule were designed to last two days, meaning
that had the cosmonauts not been able to descend, they would have
been in jeopardy by Thursday morning.
   According to the Soviet space official, however, the cosmonauts
could have stretched supplies of oxygen, water and food for up to a
week. After that the capsule would be like ``a lone boat in the
ocean,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He did not explain how the air supply could be extended.
   The capsule would have landed in China had the descent not been
aborted. The space official said contingency landing sites in
general were not desirable because no proper ground crews would be
there.
   An Izvestia article under the headline ``Anxious Hours in
Space'' reported this exchange between mission control and the
cosmonauts:
   ``How are things with food?'' a mission controller asked.
   ``There is no food,'' said Lyakhov.
   ``But in the accident reserves?'' the controller asked.
   ``There is some, but why touch it? We will endure,'' Lyakhov
said.
   Tass said the cosmonauts ``are in for difficult hours in orbit
until the designated time of landing.''
   Soviet television showed black-and-white videotape taken from
the Soyuz in which the Mir station, whose extended solar panels
gave it the shape of a T, grew steadily smaller as the capsule
pulled away.
   Television commentator Alexander Tikhomirov said later, in a
somber voice:
   ``We are already used to everything going smoothly in space, and
some forget about the danger which space research entails. And here
this once more convinces us how complex a matter it is and what a
huge amount of abnormal situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit.''
   Trouble began soon after the Soyuz left its dock on the Mir.
   An engine used to slow the capsule for entering Earth's
atmosphere fired automatically while the vehicle was out of radio
contact with ground control, Izvestia said.
   When contact was restored, Lyakhov gave his report that the
engine stopped after 60 seconds, far short of the 230 seconds
needed to brake the capsule for a safe re-entry, Soviet media said.
   Controllers decided to delay another attempt for three hours,
Izvestia reported. During that time, scientists found that sunlight
had interfered with a sensor in an infrared guidance system and a
computer automatically terminated the engine burn.
   Seven minutes later, the sensor locked onto its correct target
and the guidance system worked properly. The engine fired again,
but because the on-board computer had not been reprogrammed the
capsule was sent on a trajectory for a landing in China, the
reports said.
   The cosmonauts stopped the engine manually after three seconds
and tried again, but that time the engine stopped after six seconds
and the decision was made to wait until Wednesday.
   Valery Ryumin, a cosmonaut and the mission chief, told Izvestia:
   ``Don't worry, nothing terrible has happened yet. The life
support system will last for two days.''

<HEAD>Slain Premier Discussed Arms At Peace Conference, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assassinated Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden
probably tried to sell arms to India during a 1986 disarmament
conference the month before he died, a former Palme aide said on a
television news program Tuesday.
   Palme, whose February 1986 shooting in Stockholm remains
unsolved, discussed an arms sale with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
of India during an international conference on disarmament in New
Delhi in January 1986, according to the program ``First Tuesday''
broadcast on commercial Independent Television.
   The program quoted John Edwards, whom the program identified as
an adviser for Palme on disarmament, as saying Palme asked Gandhi
to buy 400 long-range howitzers from Bofors AB, Sweden's largest
arms maker.
   Gandhi rejected advice from Indian military experts to purchase
rival French-manufactured cannon and awarded a $1.36 billion
contract to Bofors, which had been experiencing financial troubles,
the program said.
   It was Sweden's largest-ever export contract, the program said.
   ``I think he (Palme) obviously used that opportunity (the
conference) to discuss the Bofors-India deal,'' Edwards said.
   A Swedish government investigation concluded in June that Bofors
paid unspecified commissions in the deal, but did not say whether
those payments violated the agreement.
   ``First Tuesday'' said Gandhi supported the deal because of
guarantees it would be free of middlemen and commissions, which
usually raise the cost.
   Palme was shot in downtown Stockholm on Feb. 28, 1986 while
walking home from a movie. Police have failed to establish a motive
or prosecute any suspect.
   The program also alleged that Palme allowed Swedish
manufacturers to skirt laws banning arms exports to warring
countries, making it possible for Swedish arms to reach Iran during
its eight-year war with Iraq.
   The United Nations had appointed Palme to mediate in the war,
but ``First Tuesday'' said Swedish companies supplied Iran with
trucks and patrol boats and helped the Iranians build an explosives
factory.
   Last month, the Swedish magazine ``Z'' claimed that Palme was
assassinated in revenge for stopping the sale by Bofors of 18
cannon to Iran in late 1985.

   Opponents of the military government have
been given limited access to national television for the first time
in 15 years as both sides formally opened their campaigns for the
presidential plebiscite.
   Under a new electoral law that went into effect late Monday,
supporters of President Augusto Pinochet and the opposition will
have 15 minutes of free time daily on national television to carry
their messages to Chile's 7.2 million registered voters.
   Neither side has to pay for the programs that by law can
continue until Oct. 1, four days before the plebiscite in which
Gen. Pinochet, the army commander, is the only candidate.
   The opposition, which has complained about its lack of access to
government-controlled television, criticized the late hour set by
the new law. It states both sides will have 15 minutes alternating
between the time period of 10:45 p.m. and 11:.15 p.m.
   ``For the first time in 15 years those who do not share the
government views have the opportunity to adress you on
television,'' said Patricio Banados, the opposition's official
announcer in opening the Monday night program. ``Fifteen minutes in
15 years is not too much.''
   Pinochet led the coup in September 1973 that ousted the elected
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende. Pinochet has
ruled the country since then and was selected last month by the
military junta he controls as the sole candidate in next month's
ballot.
   In the referendum Chileans will vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on
Pinochet. If he is approved he will start an eight-year term as
president next March. If rejected, a multiple-candidate election
will take place in December 1989 with Pinochet remaining in power
until then.
   During the opposition's television program Monday its campaign
song, ``Chile, Joy is Coming,'' was played constantly.
   The program ended with Patricio Aylwin, a centrist who is the
main spokesman for a 16-group coalition, urging a ``no'' vote in
the plebiscite and challenging Pinochet to a a face-to-face debate
on national television.
   The government based its program mainly on economics, saying
inflation had been reduced to an annual rate of about 10 percent
and noting the increase in exports.
   It also showed television clips and photographs of the street
violence, food shortages and other economic problems during
Allende's government.
   An announcer said those conditions would return if the
referendum is defeated.
   The 15-minute programs will be the only television advertising
allowed to the opposition. Paid political advertising is banned by
law on the television stations that are operated either by the
government or various universities.
   The government has broadcast a series of referendum-related
advertisements but officials claimed they did not violate the law
and were a ``legitimate promotion of the government's work and
achievements.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush are offering
starkly different views of the nation's economy as they head into
the decisive two months of the 1988 presidential campaign.
   Dukakis said at a Labor Day rally in Detroit that under the
Republicans ``the rich have gotten richer; the poor have gotten
poorer.''
   He said millions of high-paying jobs have been replaced by
low-wage positions, and asked: ``Can we afford four more years of
that?''
   Republican rival Bush touted economic gains under the Reagan
administration, saying the administration has created ``17{ million
jobs, more disposable income for the American people, lower taxes.
... And all my opponent can do is tell the American people how bad
things are.''
   The vice president said the campaign is ``about protecting the
gains we've made in jobs and peace and it's about how to make new
breakthroughs in both areas.''

   Pope John Paul II's customary message
of peace and reconciliation could be a controversial one when he
visits Mozambique, a southern African nation wracked by 12 years of
civil war, drought and systematic destruction of public facilities.
   A newsletter issued last year by Frelimo, the governing Marxist
party, called the former Portuguese colony's Roman Catholic bishops
``enemies of the people'' after they suggested the government meet
with guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance.
   But Cardinal Alexandre dos Santos says he hopes the pope will
call for reconciliation when he visits the country Sept. 16-19.
   President Joaquim Chissano, who was visiting the pope in the
Vatican when the bishops made their plea, said it was impossible to
negotiate with the guerrillas who, he charged, mutilate children,
burn schools and hospitals, and massacre villagers.
   The guerrilla movement, known as RENAMO, denies such charges and
says it is fighting to replace the Marxist government with a
democratic one.
   ``We hope (the pope) will say something about peace since we are
in this situation of war,'' said Dos Santos, who became a cardinal
in June. ``We don't see how we can end this struggle without
reconciliation. ... It is necessary to have dialogue with these
people.''
   Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said the government hopes the
pope will not appeal for negotiations with RENAMO. He said no one
had the right to suggest that the government ``should talk with
terrorists, with those who commit massacres, ... those who have
been roundly condemned, not only by Mozambique but by the
international community.''
   Job Chambal, director of the government's Department of
Religious Affairs, is overseeing the return of some church property
confiscated when Frelimo came to power at independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   He said of the bishops: ``Our quarrel with them is not the fact
that they called for negotiations _ any Mozambican is free to think
that. The one thing that worried the government was to ... say that
the government as well as RENAMO are responsible for the war.''
   Chambal said the plan to return all confiscated church property
used for worship came coincidentally three months before the pope's
visit.
   ``We were not trying to please the pope,'' he said. ``It's a way
of showing we don't belong to an evil empire.''
   Since 1982, when the late President Samora Machel held meetings
with church leaders, the government has sought to ease tension
between the churches and Frelimo.
   The government invited the pope to visit Mozambique in his
capacity as head of the Vatican state, and it is sharing expenses
with the local church.
   ``It's very expensive, but it's very important,'' Chambal said.
``The willingness of the pope to come to Mozambique means there's
been a very big improvement because people have understood what it
means when we say we have a socialist state.''
   ``We are Marxists, but all of us in government have some
religious background,'' said Chambal, who was reared a
Presbyterian. ``We still have some religious feeling. Even our
revolutionary songs have a religious taste. But our children will
be more Marxist, and teach their children to be Marxists.''
   He said the government wants children to be influenced only by
the state until they are 18, when they can choose whether to go to
church, but this policy is not enforced. In the years immediately
after independence, some churches were closed, services were
interrupted and religious activity was officially discouraged.
   Now churches operate freely. Both cathedral services and prayer
meetings in the bush are packed on Sundays.
   The Frelimo revolutionaries accused Roman Catholic bishops and
priests of cooperating with the Portuguese colonial government and
opposing independence in return for a favored position as a state
church.
   The cardinal says some Portuguese clergymen supported
colonialism, but denies the Mozambican Roman Catholic Church as a
whole was against independence.
   All church-state problems are not resolved, Cardinal dos Santos
said, but he maintained the government does not understand the
church's goals.
   ``They suppose we want only to teach those who want to be
religious leaders,'' he said. ``We also want to prepare the people
for running the country.''
   Dos Santos said that of Mozambique's 14.5 million people, 2
million are Catholics.

   The fatal crash landing of a Chinese jetliner
has fired up debate on replacing Hong Kong's airport, known for its
harrowing flight path that skims the rooftops of crowded Kowloon
peninsula.
   The British-built Trident jetliner skidded off Hong Kong
International Airport's sole runway into the sea in a torrential
downpour Aug. 31, killing seven people in Hong Kong's worst air
accident in 21 years.
   The accident came at a time when the British colony is
considering construction of a new airport away from congested urban
areas. The government is funding three surveys to evaluate various
proposals.
   The colony's governor, Sir David Wilson, said immediately
following the crash that it should have no bearing on the future of
the existing airport, which is known as Kai Tak.
   The English-language South China Morning Post newspaper agreed,
but noted in an editorial that ``there is no doubt that the crash
will focus renewed attention on the apparently never-ending saga of
Hong Kong's need for expanded aviation facilities.''
   Kai Tak is squeezed between the sea and the impossibly crowded
neighborhoods of Kowloon, one of the colony's major urban areas.
The runway juts into Hong Kong's famed harbor and is surrounded on
three sides by water.
   Use of the airport has expanded rapidly. Last year, 12.7 million
passengers were handled, an increase of 20 percent from the year
before and nearly 50 percent from 1982. Movement of aircraft
reached 73,370 planes in 1986, an increase of 13.2 percent from the
previous year.
   ``The single runway, required to handle an aircraft every 180
seconds during peak hours, has exhausted its possibilities,'' the
Morning Post said. The government says the runway can handle up to
30 planes an hour.
   Victor Sit, a University of Hong Kong professor who studies
urban problems, expressed concern that the airport's enviable
safety record may run into trouble as traffic increases.
   ``We've been lucky,'' he said. ``So far, the accidents all
happened on the harbor side of the airport, not on the landward
side.'' Although the Chinese jetliner crashed while approaching the
runway from the harbor, flights typically make their final approach
over Kowloon.
   ``The approach of the airport obviously requires very careful
maneuvering by the pilots concerned and very precise control ... by
the airport,'' Sit said. Passengers rarely forget the final moments
before touchdown when planes come breathtakingly close to Kowloon's
buildings.
   Kai Tak critics note the airport becomes paralyzed whenever the
runway is disrupted, cutting the colony's main transportation link
to the outside world. The Chinese jetliner crash stopped traffic
for about six hours.
   They also argue that the airport's urban location makes life
miserable for many local residents. A recent study estimated 1
million people suffer unacceptable noise from Kai Tak.
   Government officials have been considering replacement
possibilities for years and are actively looking at two sites near
outlying Lantau Island for a new airport. A final decision has been
promised by the end of 1989.
   The most ambitious proposal is from a group led by Hopewell
Holdings Ltd. The massive $3.08 billion-plan would include an
airport, seaport, road and railway complex on reclaimed land off
the island's east coast near Hong Kong island.
   The tiny Portuguese territory of Macao, 40 miles southwest of
Hong Kong, also has proposed building its own international airport.
   And China, which regains sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997,
plans to construct an airport in its Shenzhen special economic zone
just over the Hong Kong border. Sit said that airport would only
``help to ease our trouble a little bit.''
   He believes Kai Tak will reach capacity in three to five years,
around the time construction could be starting on a new airport,
unless the government bows to pressure to act faster.
   ``That would mean they only start construction when the airport
itself has exceeded capacity,'' Sit said. ``It would be fairly
difficult for Hong Kong to operate as an international financial
trading and tourist center, unless we have some other arrangement.'

<DATELINE>BALAMBHU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oblivious to a pouring rain, Lokmaya
crouches beside a muddy rivulet and scrubs her children's clothes
with a bar of pink soap.
   Her two little girls, at her side, appear to be about 4 and 8
years old. But Lokmaya doesn't know their ages, or even her own.
   ``I don't keep track of such things,'' she says. But with a
proud smile, she adds that she also has a son and he is 6.
   Lokmaya gave birth to three other children but they did not
survive infancy. She doesn't know why and says her surviving
children are often sick with fevers.
   Health care is a battle of mountainous proportions in Nepal
where both man and nature are the enemy, creating what health
workers call ``the silent emergency.''
   An earthquake rumbled through the Himalayan mountains, foothills
and valleys Aug. 21, killing more than 700 people in Nepal and at
least 300 in neighboring India.
   However, Nepal's biggest killer is far less dramatic and strikes
every day. It is diarrhea, and it claims 45,000 lives a year,
according to figures compiled by the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the Nepalese government. Nearly all the victims are
children.
   Eleven percent of all babies die before the age of a year. Two
out of three children under 5 suffer from malnutrition, further
decreasing their chances of avoiding _ or surviving _ diarrhea and
the six other most prevalent diseases: diphtheria, whooping cough,
tetanus, measles, tuberculosis and polio.
   ``Nearly 50 percent of the diseases could be controlled easily
if you could provide potable water to the people,'' said Shreebatsa
Prasad Shrestha, an undersecretary in the Ministry of Health.
   Nepal, the fabled kingdom in the sky, is a land of beauty and
mystery, luring adventurers to conquer the majestic heights of
Mount Everest, to search for the Abominable Snowman, to explore the
pagoda-like temples where Buddhism met Hinduism and spawned the
kind of architecture that belongs in fairy tales.
   It is a country where tourists are warned not to drink the
water, where Western embassies have their own doctors and are
poised to fly their citizens to Bangkok in Thailand, New York or
London for hospital treatment.
   The Nepalese have little choice but to drink the water, and only
25 percent of them get it from a tap or well, Shrestha said. The
rest fetch water from open streams where livestock wallow and
people bathe.
   The country has one doctor for every 26,000 people, in contrast
to one doctor per 5,000 people in India and one per 780 in the
United States.
   Lokmaya's village of Balambhu has better health care than most
in this nation of 17 million people. People can walk to the local
health post in a few minutes, and the village of 1,000 is less than
6 miles from Katmandu, the capital, where there are free doctors.
   In more remote areas, people must walk for days to reach a
health post, which may have up to four staffers: a midwife and as
many as three ``health assistants'' with first-aid kits.
   Even in Balambhu, the concept of water-borne diseases such as
diarrhea is rudimentary.
   Down the road from where Lokmaya was doing her laundry, women
washed their families' breakfast dishes, their children and
themselves in another tiny rivulet of water coursing through the
mud.
   A few yards away, a teen-age boy scrubbed a water buffalo. A
smaller boy wearing only a tattered brown shirt squatted nearby,
for the ground along the rivulet serves as a latrine.
   Plans for development in Nepal, where the per capita annual
income is $160 a year, anticipate that 18 percent of all homes will
have toilets by the year 2000, compared to an estimated 3 percent
now. Television, which started in Nepal only two years ago, has
already reached 13 percent of the people and is expected to reach
60 percent by the year 2000.
   Foreign health workers said they have found people quick to
learn health and hygiene precautions, once they understand why they
must change their habits.
   Joann Duffy, Katmandu director of Dooley Intermed, a New York
City-based foundation, said her staff is training Nepalese nurses
to conduct classes for menial workers in hospitals.
   ``We demonstrate how to sweep. We show them how to clean a
latrine. We show them how to dig a pit for trash. We show them how
to wash their hands,'' said Ms. Duffy, an infection control
practitioner from Torrance, Calif.
   The Nepalese terrain is harder to conquer. Many areas, even
those at lower altitudes, are far from roads that motor vehicles
can travel.
   Under a nationwide vaccination campaign aimed at combating
tuberculosis, measles and other diseases, UNICEF workers are hiking
up to four days to reach remote villages.
   The serum they carry in specially designed ``cold packs'' must
be kept below certain temperatures, and the packs can only maintain
that temperature for 48 hours, according to UNICEF's chief
representative in Katmandu, Lay Maung, a Burmese doctor.
   To maintain the correct temperature, relays of runners follow
them with blocks of ice to keep the serum cool.

<HEAD>To The Government: Butt Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As an authority on economic and business
productivity, C. Jackson Grayson Jr. watches in amazement as one
legislator after another thinks government has the answers.
   Having served in three administrations, Grayson knows how
limited are government's abilities to intervene in the marketplace
and correct its problems, specifically when they involve global
competitiveness.
   In that area, he says, there are important things that
government should not do, no matter how insistent and intense the
pressure. In keeping with that belief, he and associate Carla
O'Dell have issued some cautionary advice.
   Their views are in the form of a book titled, ``American
Business: A Two-Minute Warning,'' although it would take even the
most efficient and productive reader a lot longer than that to
digest their advice.
   Grayson, chairman of the American Productivity Center in
Houston, is well-grounded in his subject, having been President
Nixon's price commissioner, and a member of President Carter's
Commission on the Agenda for the 80s and President Reagan's
National Productivity Advisory Council.
   From such vantage points, says Grayson, he has observed growing
pressure on government to ``do something'' about America's
competitive posture, which is reflected in the balance of payments
deficit and other problems.
   Over the past five years, he says, there have been 112
recommendations for government action by 21 councils, commissions,
congressional hearings and study groups on productivity and
competitiveness.
   It is frightening, say Grayson and O'Dell, that the 99th
Congress had 108 committees and subcommittees in the Senate and 178
in the House, with 3,000 staffers ``feeling they must do something
to help American competitiveness.''
   Stating that such determination by Washington to do something
``keeps us awake at night,'' the authors name five things they feel
government must not do to ``help American competitiveness.''
   1. The single worst thing is to increase protection, say Grayson
and O'Dell. They say it invites reciprocity, lowers efficiency and
shrinks export-related jobs.
   Granting protection, they say, ``is like putting an industry on
a life-support system. It may prolong life for a while, but it
can't restore health.''
   2. Government should not establish industrial policies.
   Industrial policies are, in effect, attempts at centrally
directing the economy to specific national goals. Call it
``national planning'' and you might get an argument, but you would
also have material to defend yourself.
   Industrial policies have been resurrected under the labels of
``trade policies'' or ``competitiveness policies'' or ``living
standards acts.''
   Grayson and O'Dell maintain that government personnel are not,
by instinct or background, entrepreneurs or managers, and that
their allocation decisions would be worse than those of the private
sector.
   Furthermore, they observe, authors and administrators of
policies and laws tend to be lawyers or economists with little
knowledge of business operations. And, they ask, aren't we aware
that government cannot plan long range and cannot stay atop the
rapid, continuous adjustments of a dynamic market?
   3. The country should avoid currency devaluation as a
competitiveness strategy.
   Among other things, they argue, devaluing the dollar makes the
United States compete on the basis of a lower standard of living.
``Devaluation keeps knocking the dollar down until American wages
are cheap enough to compete.''
   4. Capital investment shouldn't be overemphasized.
   ``We stress that capital investment is not only important for
productivity improvement, it is essential,'' they say. ``What we
argue against is the overemphasis and wrong emphasis on capital
investment.''
   One of their reasons for so thinking is that ``merely calling
for more capital investment confuses the volume of capital
investment with the productivity of that investment.''
   5. More research and development is not necessarily better.
   ``The biggest competitive problem is not the amount spent on
R&D, but on what is spent, and what is done with the ideas and
techniques after discovery.''
   The United States, they point out, is still the world leader in
originating new ideas. But, ``while that is great for the good of
the world, what counts in competitiveness is rapid
commercialization of new knowledge.''

<HEAD>Willem Dafoe Talks About ``That Movie''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willem Dafoe is a modest man, but he couldn't
help thinking the time was right to play the title role in ``The
Last Temptation of Christ.''
   ``It made all the sense in the world,'' he said. ``I thought,
`Yes, of course. Perfect. It's a good role. I feel right for it
right now.' I'm just at the point in my life where I'm concerned
with some of the things he's speaking about. The struggle between
the body and the spirit is something I'm interested in.''
   Few films have generated as much controversy as Martin
Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' Based on the novel by
Nikos Kazantzakis, it depicts an angst-ridden Jesus, torn between
desires of the mind and body. In a dream sequence, he is spared the
cross, sleeps with Mary Magdalene and has children. The movie has
drawn fierce protests from some religious groups.
   ``I was a little surprised,'' Dafoe said. ``I knew there was
some resistance. ... I never thought it would be to this extent and
take this kind of shape.''
   However, the publicity generated from the protests has helped
the movie at the box office.
   ``It's always a terrific thing for a publicity campaign,'' Dafoe
said. ``But it colors everything in a negative light. Maybe that's
a trade-off to the publicity.''
   Dafoe was eager to work with Scorsese, the director of ``Mean
Streets,'' ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull.''
   ``He just gave me a certain kind of confidence and authority. He
kept me on the track. He makes you feel comfortable; he gives you
that room. You feel totally unencumbered, free, yet you feel a
guiding hand.''
   Dafoe also enjoyed working with the cast, which included Barbara
Hershey as Mary Magdalene and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate.
   ``There was a real sense of purpose,'' he said. ``Marty commands
a lot of respect. There was very little money, and the actors were
doing it for scale. Everyone wanted to be there. A real ensemble
feel.''
   Although Dafoe had seen other biblical movies, he had no
interest in repeating others' performances.
   ``I really didn't concern myself with what kind of Jesus I was
going to be _ the responsibility of playing that role, all the
associations, all the information. I thought I would find a place
to scrub myself clean of all that and really start out from a
wonderfully innocent place.''
   Dafoe's confidence was helped by his faith in Scorsese: ``I
would not be cowed by the role. It was a very risky thing. If
you're going to be in a situation like that, you might as well be
with Martin Scorsese.''
   The intensity of his performance in ``Last Temptation'' can be
measured by his eyes, which rarely blink on camera.
   ``No matter what you do, it has mythic proportions,'' he said.
``When you're speaking, no matter the context, there is some kind
of concentration that's not of this world.
   ``The general tendency is to look as deeply as you can into the
back of someone's brain and deeply understand with every cell in
your body what you're saying.''
   The 33-year-old actor talked about his career at the Performing
Garage, home of the Wooster Group, an experimental theater company.
Dafoe is a member and does business there.
   He was born July 22, 1955, in Appleton, Wis., and was early
attracted to the stage. ``Simply moronic reasons,'' he said,
smiling. ``It's fun, it's enjoyable. I like pretending.''
   As he grew older, his feelings for acting deepened.
   ``In the end, it's for its own sake _ for beauty's sake. A lot
of professions, you're tracked. You do this, you get that. In
acting, you become the canvas. It totally goes back to you,'' he
said.
   ``You're constantly questioning why you do what you do. You're
constantly evolving. It's a healthy way to live, but very
difficult.''
   He became a full-time actor at 18, and in 1977, he saw the
Wooster Group give a performance of ``Rumstick Road.''
   ``It was just unlike anything I'd ever seen,'' he said. ``The
event was so extraordinary. It touched my heart. There's no
accounting for it. I couldn't identify it. It had that kind of
maniac energy and this really fluid transformation.''
   Dafoe joined the Wooster Group but also pursued a career in
film. After appearing in a few minor films in 1983, he began to
attract attention with ``Streets of Fire'' in 1984 and ``To Live
and Die in L.A.'' in 1985.
   His big breakthrough came the following year with ``Platoon,''
Oliver Stone's Academy Award-winning film about the Vietnam War.
Dafoe's portrayal of the sympathetic Sergeant Elias earned him an
Oscar nomination for supporting actor.
   Despite film work, he has continued his involvement with the
Wooster Group. ``The whole desire to play around with forms is a
liberating thing for an actor,'' he said..

   Republican presidential nominee George ``Poppy''
Bush went off to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., at age 13,
before the word ``preppy'' had been invented, and later attended
Yale. A reporter looking into the school days of both Bush and his
Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, talked with former classmates
and teachers who generally remember him as ``a real nice guy'' and
a good athlete. Dukakis' schoolmates will get their say in the next
story.

<DATELINE>ANDOVER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has shed the Ben Franklin
glasses, dropped his twangy voice a note or two and now eschews
button-down shirts _anything to get rid of the preppy image that
dogs his run for president against Michael Dukakis.
   ``There's a tendency to have you fit into a mold,'' the
Republican vice president complained recently. ``The mold for me is
a kind of Ivy League elitist, and I resist it.''
   Alas, Bush might have avoided the whole Eastern establishment
WASP wimp caricature had he been born in Columbus, Ohio, like his
father, or in St. Louis like his mother's clan or in Kingsport,
Tenn., like older brother Prescott Jr.
   Well, almost. Prescott Sr. did go to Yale, as did George, his
three brothers, four uncles and cousins by the half-dozens.
   Still, Dad was a Midwest hardware salesman before U.S. Rubber
absorbed his small firm and transferred him to Braintree, Mass.,
where George was born on June 12, 1924, in nearby Milton.
   A transfer to the New York office relocated the family in the
affluent commuter town of Greenwich, Conn., but they weren't
established Easterners until Dad turned to investment banking,
bought that 11-room Victorian house with a huge rolling lawn on
Grove Lane and became moderator of the town meeting.
   Later, years later, when George was out of Yale and wildcatting
for oil in Texas, his father twice won election to the U.S. Senate
and became a golfing partner of Dwight Eisenhower.
   George at age 5 went off to the Greenwich Country Day School.
From the start, he was a good athlete, thanks to Mom, Dorothy
Walker Bush, who had made it to the finals of the Girls National
Tennis Championship and is still going strong, riding her bike at
86, handing out campaign literature.
   ``Physically, she is a small woman, but she is made of mighty
stuff,'' George wrote in a Mother's Day salute three years ago for
the Greenwich Time newspaper. ``Nine months into her first
pregnancy she played baseball. Her last time up she hit a home run
and without missing a base continued right off the field to the
hospital to deliver Pres.''
   Sundays after Episcopal services at Christ Church, there was
always a baseball game on the Bush lawn with George, being
left-handed, holding down first base, a position he excelled at
when he captained the Yale nine into the national collegiate finals
and got to meet Babe Ruth.
   ``Poppy, as we called him, had good hand-to-eye coordination,''
recalls retired Time-Life executive Evan Ingels, a classmate at the
Country Day School. ``He was a running back on our football team,
good also at soccer, tennis and wrestling. We were both a year
younger than the others and rivals for head of the class.''
   George was nicknamed ``Little Pop,'' then ``Poppy,'' for his
hero worship of his maternal grandfather, George ``Pop'' Walker, a
fine athlete who donated the Walker Cup to golf. Grandpa Walker,
who presided over those blissful summers in the rambling
ocean-front house at Kennebunkport, Maine, that Bush now owns, was
``a staunch Democrat'' until Roosevelt came along. ``Roosevelt made
him see red,'' a friend recalls.
   Ingels remembers ``staying over'' at the Bush home on Halloween
and hiding out in the graveyard after ``squirting people with a
water pistol loaded with green ink and belting them with a sock
full of flour.''
   ``Poppy _ I never knew him as anything else _ was a real nice
guy, decent and honest, never a braggart. Maybe that's the trouble
with the world today. Suddenly a nice guy is a wimp. He was never a
wimp in my book. He's not the type to shake his fist at people, but
he's got plenty of strong fibers.''
   One day fifth-grade teacher Arthur Grant got them thinking about
the future: ``Some of you will go into business and be leaders.
Others may go into politics. Who knows, one of you might be
president of the United States.'' He had no one in mind then, but
at 89 he remembers Bush as ``a good athlete. He and his brothers
always had a real code of ethics.''
   Breakfast in the Bush household began with mother or father
reading a passage from the Bible. Both parents stressed values,
especially fairness, modesty and service to others, and were
pleased with George's report card evaluation: ``Claims no more than
his fair share of attention.''

   Shirley Flower Sedgewick, who married Howard Sedgewick, George's
classmate at Country Day, recalls the strong patriarchal presence
of Prescott Sr. when the dating game began for the Bush boys:
```Now don't you think it's time to take this young lady home?' he
would say, and immediately the family chauffeur, Alex, would be
called into action.''
   The word ``preppy'' had not been invented when 13-year-old
George went off to Phillips Academy here in Andover and became a
``prep,'' the campus word for newcomer. He wore a little blue
rowing cap topped with a white button, carried the luggage of the
lordly seniors to their dorms on the upper hill, burst immediately
into any song they commanded, could not venture near the flag staff
where upperclassmen were allowed to smoke, and was not to be seen
on Main Street until the football team beat Exeter, ``the hated
redmen from the north.''
   ``In those days Andover consciously imitated the English public
schools like Eton and Rugby, so a little hazing was in order,''
said retired English master Hart Leavitt. He remembers George as an
``indifferent scholar. In my class he was a nonentity, just sat
there and didn't contribute much. A nice guy but that's about all.
He looked like the cover on the Preppy Handbook that came out
awhile ago. I didn't have much contact with him outside class, but
I must say wimp is the last word I would apply to him.''
   Chemistry tutor and basketball coach Frank DiClementi, who knew
George better back then, has different memories. ``From the first
day I saw him, I knew he was something special. He came from a
family with the right priorities. Some kids aren't ready to come
here. He was. I never saw him down. Always hustling, but a good
loser although you couldn't be jolly about the damn thing.''
   Wearing the bow tie that is his trademark, ``Deak,'' as decades
of old grads call him, sat on the porch of the Andover Inn
summoning up the past from the background shouts of the playing
fields.
   ``Poppy was captain of baseball and soccer, played every minute
of every game, but I had to talk him into going out for basketball.
He was afraid of denying another kid a place on the team. He was a
good hacker, as we called regular fellows, always thinking of
others.
   ``There was a Jewish kid nicknamed `Ovie' _ dead now _ who left
school when he didn't get tapped for any of the Greek societies.
They talked him into coming back, and Poppy was the first to
befriend him, got him to come out for baseball. One day a fly ball
bounced off Ovie's head into the left-fielder's glove and Poppy
congratulated him on an assist.''
   George and his schoolmates trod the leafy walks in fear of the
righteous wrath of ``The Bald One,'' headmaster Claude Fuess, who
could ring down the thunder for violating 9 p.m. lights-out curfew
or after a bun fight in ``the beanery,'' as the dining rooms in the
student Commons were called.
   The boys often had a tough time keeping a straight face when
campus cutup John Uhler Lemmon III deftly mimicked the head's
portentous waddle. Jack, a year behind George, later made a career
of his comic skills on Broadway and in Hollywood.
   Coming of age in Andover, ``the inmates'' boasted of making the
most of the weekly tea dance to gratify the ``old B.U.,'' defined
in the 1942 Pot Pourri, George's yearbook, as ``the biological
urge.''
   ``The music is usually fair, but the girls are not,'' the class
social historian observed. ``By 8 p.m. the couples are to be found
mostly in the bird sanctuary or in the girls' cars, while faculty
wives attempt to police the affair.''
   As the decade of the '40s began, the outside world intruded on
the lovely wooded and landscaped campus where Oliver Wendell Holmes
first dabbled in verse and where Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose
husband taught here, lies buried in the little graveyard.
   ``Upper-middles,'' third-year boys like George, huddled under
blankets to listen to the war news from Europe on ``contraband''
radios.
   Besides morning chapel and nightly bed check, student activities
included air raid drills and drawing the blackout curtains. Younger
masters were leaving to join the Royal Canadian Air Force, and one
day at assembly a refugee named Heinz Langerhans told in a thick
accent about life in a Nazi concentration camp.
   By senior year, crew cuts were in fashion, and Petty girls
adorned the dorms of this academy founded in 1789 for ``the
virtuous pious education of youth.''

   On a recent visit to his alma mater, Bush remembered Pearl
Harbor Day, 1941, ``slouching across campus with my roommate. We
kept it on our minds that the Germans were invading Europe. We knew
exactly what we had to do. We had to beat Exeter at football.''
Which they did, 14-13, with the whole school singing and shouting
through the snowy night on that special train back from New
Hampshire.
   War was almost a curriculum elective by then. The boys sold war
bonds, donated their downtown treats money to the U.S.O., gathered
up magazines in the dorms every Thursday for the soldiers at nearby
Fort Devens, and Pot Pourri lost its slick cover to the wartime
paper shortage.
   The class historian noted that ``the whole school thrilled to an
address at morning chapel by Col. Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary
of War'' and an Andover trustee. George, as chairman of the student
deacons, got to escort the secretary to the podium, in addition to
his regular duties of checking attendance and taking up the
collection.
   Caught up in the patriotic fervor, George on his 18th birthday,
just a few days after graduation, took the train to Boston to
enlist in the Navy. In the yearbook poll of 193 graduates, he
ranked third behind varsity quarterback Elliott Vose as ``most
popular,'' ``handsomest'' ``most respected'' and ``best all-around
fellow.'' He rated second in ``most faculty drag'' and was out of
the running as ``most intelligent,'' ``most likely to succeed'' and
``ladies' man.''
   His name was read out in chapel on a September morning in 1944
when his carrier-based torpedo bomber was reported shot down in
flames in a raid on the Japanese airstrips on Chichi Jima and again
when word came that he had been plucked from a rubber raft in the
Pacific by a surfacing submarine, the USS Finback.
   For George Herbert Walker Bush, the preppy years were
essentially over. When he entered Yale in November l945, he was
hardly your Peter Arno cartoon caricature of a Yalie, although
typical of that first postwar term when three out of five were
veterans and gray flannels were beginning to replace officer pink
on the old campus.
   Bush was already married and soon to start a family. He and
Barbara first lived in a Quonset hut near the Payne Whitney gym,
then in a series of apartments, the last one, as he ad-libbed after
a recent campus speech, so close to President Charles Seymour's
house ``you could look in the window and see his wife taking a
bath.''
   Poppy, as he was still called, sailed though an accelerated
economics program in 2{ years, won the Francis Gordon Brown Prize
as the outstanding junior and went on to earn Phi Beta Kappa. He
also found time to burp baby George, play three years of varsity
baseball, letter in soccer and take part in an occcasional
fraternity beer bust at the Delta Kappa Epsilon house.
   His name didn't make the New Haven police blotter for that riot
after the pep rally on the eve of the Cornell football game. His
l948 classbook supplied some vivid details: ``Just how many heads
collided with billy sticks cannot accurately be counted nor how
many rolls of toilet paper flew out of dormitory windows, but there
is someone who claims he personally stopped 31 trolley cars.''
   Like his father before him, and such diverse luminaries as
William Howard Taft, Averell Harriman, Henry Luce, Archibald
MacLeish, Potter Stewart, William F. Buckley and William Sloane
Coffin, George was one of l5 juniors tapped for Skull and Bones,
the oldest and most secret of the societies anchoring Yale's old
boy network. He went through the rumored (Bonesmen never tell)
initiation of climbing into a coffin to confess his sins
(preferably erotic) in ``The Tomb,'' the windowless, brown
sandstone club house.
   Although Bush went 3 for 5, the big disappointment in his senior
year was the baseball team's loss to the University of California
in the national collegiate finals.
   As one who knew him well in the preppy days, has kept in touch
since the college years and ``will be rooting for him in the
Electoral College,'' old coach Deke DiClementi has a word of
caution for reporters on the Bush beat:
   ``Don't say he's a nice guy. He really IS a nice guy. That's
what's killing him.''

   About 25 million Americans have left the land
since 1930. As industry turned out larger tractors and combines and
more effective chemical fertilizers and pesticides, small-scale
farmers simply couldn't match the cost-per-bushel efficiency of the
big operators. But some neighborly farmers in one Kansas community
figure America needs the family farm for more than just food.

<TEXT>
   Jack Greep's wheat got cut, bundled,
shocked, racked, hauled and threshed this year, even though Jack
was not there to help.
   Nothing unusual about that in this northeastern Kansas community
of 109 friendly souls. Or, for that matter, in any other farming
community in the land. It is an axiom of rural living: If a
neighbor needs help, you help.
   Jack Greep, a man with a mission, died just after planting time.
His death may explain why his neighbors seemed to go at this year's
harvest of his wheat with a special fervor.
   For the last 13 years of Jack Greep's life _ that would be from
about the time the agricultural experts began predicting seriously
the inevitable extinction of the American family farm _ Jack had
set aside, each year, two acres of wheat for the sole purpose of
celebrating the values that the family farm represents.
   The two acres survived the drought. Whether the values will
survive is a question.
   ``Jack had the feeling,'' said his widow, Jo Greep, sitting
under a shade tree taking in the ageless scene of a wheat harvest
in progress, ``that all of what this means to all of us, and,
really, to the country, would be lost if family farms vanished.
   ``He started doing it I guess just for sentimental reasons. What
you're looking at is an old-fashioned threshing bee.''
   Indeed, and the labor involved just for old time's sake
demonstrated why the agricultural experts are likely right.
   All that cutting, bundling, shocking, racking, hauling and
threshing by all those sweating men and straining animals on Jack
Greep's two acres now is done in one operation by one man in one
air-conditioned combine moving through miles of ripe wheat as
effortlessly as a paddle-wheel steamboat on a still lake, but
nowhere near as romantic.
   What may be lost, with the chaff of efficiency, are those
bedrock American values that Norman Rockwell celebrated and Jack
Greep cherished and his willing neighbors still cling to.
   Well, the family farm has been self-destructing since long
before combines came on the scene, and not always because of world
economics and drought, the epitaphs of the '80s. Good old American
know-how was an earlier culprit.
   About 25 million Americans have left the land since 1930. At
that time, farm families represented one-fourth of the nation's
population. After World War II, as industry turned out larger
tractors and combines and more effective chemical fertilizers and
pesticides, small-scale farmers simply couldn't match the
cost-per-bushel efficiency of the big operators.
   Now, of the nation's 2.2 million farmers, fewer than 380,000 are
family farmers, those whose only livelihood is farming. They must
compete against 130,000 big operators who produce 75 percent of the
nation's food. The federal Office of Technology Assessment figures
that by the year 2000 as few as 50,000 large-scale farmers could
get the job done.
   ``Obviously,'' says Jo Greep,``it isn't for food production that
America needs family farms.
   ``It's for the spirit of neighborliness and fellowship you're
seeing right out there in that field. I don't say those qualities
exist only in rural America, not at all. But I do think that if
there is such a thing as a national character, rural America has
had a lot to do with shaping it symbolically.
   ``If family farms were to vanish, yes, I feel it would be a
national loss.''
   For one thing, there would be no further reason for towns like
Longford to exist.
   Longford has one street, a post office, a store, a grain
elevator and an establishment called Slim's Place where the
hand-lettered sign out front advertises ``Hamburgers & Ammunition''
and the hand-lettered sign inside says ``This is not Burger King _
you get it my way or you don't get it at all.''
   ``If those fellows doing the threshing want something a little
stronger than iced tea,'' said Slim Patterson, the proprietor,
``this is where they will find it.''
   There is no question the men in the field were working up a
thirst.
   They took their turns pitching wheat bundles onto a flat wagon _
a rack, they called it _ drawn by a team of Belgian draft horses,
wide in the beam and docile.
   They climbed atop the rack, proving they still could, and
pitched the wheat onto the throbbing conveyor belt of the thresher,
old guys showing off for their wives, who were frying chickens and
mixing potato salad. Drought or not, farmers never seem underfed.
   A thresher, this one of 1925 vintage, is a marvelous contraption
of a dozen belts and gears and wheels and levers. A tractor, as
determined to keep going at age 52 as the men on the rack, provides
power for the thresher. Together they appear to get the job done,
to separate the wheat from the chaff.
   And the men from the boys.
   ``Some of the youngsters wonder how we know how to work this
thing,'' Matthew Heigele shouted above the clatter of the belts and
the wheels.
   Heigele explained how Jack Greep had acquired the thresher when
a 90-year-old neighbor died some years back. An old tractor turned
up in another barn, harness in another, wagons here and there, and
a tradition was born of tradition.
   ``I don't think anybody would want to go back to this kind of
threshing,'' Heigele said, ``but I think it's important to show
this generation how we used to do it. We helped one another, farm
by farm, because there were only a handful of threshers in the
whole county and that was the only way to get it done.
   ``It got people together. It reminded us how much we depend on
one another. That's a good lesson for everybody, not just farmers.
   ``I guess that's why I've been out here every year for the past
13. It's not only fun, it's important.''

   They are the ``blue canoes,'' the ships of the
Alaska Marine Highway System that serve as lifelines to waterbound
towns in the state's island regions. But the ferries are also
becoming more popular with tourists, an inexpensive alternative to
the cruise ships on the same scenic runs, and therein lies the rub.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE MV LeCONTE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tugboat man is in the aft bar,
telling tales of giant waves and rolling barges.
   Families are homesteading the port side passenger lounge,
staking out seats with backpacks and grocery sacks, sleeping on
blankets spread in the aisle.
   Up on deck, a tourist aims her videocam at sea otters splashing
in the kelp, as the ferry thrums past them at a steady 14 knots
toward the rock-lined passage of Sergius Narrows.
   It's another night on the MV LeConte, one of the nine ``blue
canoes'' of the Alaska Marine Highway System. For 25 years the
blue-and-white ships have served as taxis and tour boats to the
waterbound towns of Alaska's island regions.
   But the system is struggling with increasing demand at all
points. Car decks are filling more quickly as passengers come
aboard in larger cars, campers, trucks and buses, and the increase
in walk-on passengers is even greater.
   George Davidson, director of the Marine Highway since 1986,
hopes to persuade the federal government to pay for several
high-speed ferries, at a cost of $5 million to $15 million each. A
long-term plan for the ferry system is being drafted as part of
that campaign.
   The ferries sail around the clock along a 3,500-mile route, from
Seattle up Alaska's Inside Passage and out a separate run across
Prince William Sound and along the Aleutian Islands chain.
   They carry more than 370,000 people a year and 96,000 vehicles,
from tractor-trailer rigs to grocery vans and motorcycles, kayaks
and bicycles.
   They keep many towns in milk, meat, fresh lettuce and fruit.
   They carry villagers to their doctors in larger towns; high
school athletes to their rivals' gyms; winter-bound residents on
weekend joy rides.
   Babies have been born on board; people have died.
   ``You never really know what will happen,'' says Bill Unkel, the
LeConte purser. ``It's basically the same things you have anywhere
else _ it's just concentrated on a ferry.''
   The 235-foot LeConte is one of five ``village boats'' that serve
as lifelines to the smaller logging and fishing towns and carry
mostly local residents.
   Four larger sister ships, the ``mainliners,'' make the longest
runs to and from Seattle and Prince Rupert, British Columbia.
   Together they're one of Alaska's biggest tourist attractions, a
money-saving alternative to the cruise ships that share their
scenic routes. The longest trip, a 63-hour voyage from Seattle to
Haines, costs $200 for an adult. A 1{-hour run from Homer to
Seldovia, the shortest, costs $12.
   On the 408-foot Matanuska, 112 staterooms and hundreds of
tourists create the atmosphere of a floating hotel. Outfitted with
binoculars, passengers line the windows to scan for humpback and
killer whales.
   But their holiday enthusiasm doesn't disguise the no-nonsense
nature of this public transportation. Ferry life is one part
whale-watching cruise and one part city bus.
   Passengers seeking the gourmet buffets of cruise ships find
instead cafeterias reminiscent of school lunch lines. Sailors
double as parking attendants when the ferries are in port.
   And amid the stern safety warnings on the car deck, a sign
instructs passengers they shouldn't wear their sheath knives on
board.
   ``Some of our back-to-the-future gentlemen come aboard with big
Bowie knives,'' says Matanuska Purser Charles Bredehoft. ``We do
have a dress code.''
   The ferries stop at 31 communities, visiting most of them at
least every few days.
   They run according to the tides and politics.
   What town gets which ferry and when is a perennial battle at
Marine Highway headquarters and within the Alaska Legislature.
Lawmakers control the ferry budget, and thus can sway its
management.
   As the system celebrates 25 years of service, the state also
faces long-range questions about the future of its aging fleet.
   Some want to replace the slow-but-steady diesel ships with
speedier catamarans. Others say the fleet should be trimmed, that
the state can't keep a $64 million-a-year ferry system afloat.
   Boosters argue that the state's subsidy _ about half the total
cost _ is small change compared to tourist business generated by
the ferries.
   And yet others say tourism is overshadowing the ferries' first
purpose: providing a highway where roads can't be built.
   Davidson says basic transportation is the system's most
important service.
   It is understandable people would peg tourism development on the
ferry schedule, but they stand the risk of losing a crucial ferry
if there's more demand elsewhere for local residents' use, he says.
   Skagway learned that lesson last year. The tourist town has been
trying to build its winter business, but was foiled when a weekend
ferry from Juneau was canceled so residents on Prince of Wales
Island could get to Ketchikan more often.
   Some ferry workers question the life span of the current fleet.
Three ships _ the Malaspina, Matanuska and Taku _ have been in
service since the Marine Highway's first year of operation, 1963.
   The Chilkat is even older. The territorial government bought it
in 1957 to replace the area's first ferry, a war surplus Navy
landing craft that was privately run beginning in 1949.
   The youngest ferry is the Aurora, built in 1977.
   Ferry officials also are considering changing the system's
southern terminus. Alaska ferries now dock in downtown Seattle, but
Bellingham and Tacoma are vying for a new contract to be signed
next year.
   One of the big complaints of the system's 850 employees is the
lack of doctors on board. Pursers trained as emergency trauma
technicians have to handle whatever injuries occur until the
ferries can get to port.
   Bill Unkel, the LeConte purser, says his biggest hassle is
calming tourists when a ferry is delayed by loading problems or
weather.
   ``The tourists think they're on a tour boat. They don't
understand our main job is to get from point `A' to point `B',''
Unkel says.
   No. 2 on his headache list are the ferry runs crowded with
children. The ferries sell 10,000 tickets a year to Alaska students
bound for Little League games, swim meets, music competitions and
other activities in their neighboring towns.
   Most passengers say it is the pleasure of a ferry ride that
makes them take the Marine Highway instead of an airplane.
   ``We've seen glaciers and we've seen bald eagles and we've seen
whales and a lot of things we've never seen before,'' says Lynette
Smith, a Texan traveling on the LeConte with her mother. ``It's so
easy.''

   A new survey suggests there may be more giant
pandas in the wilds of China than previously thought, but wildlife
experts say they are becoming increasingly endangered by humans
encroaching on their turf. An international debate is also raging
over China's practice of loaning the animals to American zoos.

<DATELINE>WOLONG, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists and conservationists who rallied
to save the rare giant panda when its favorite food ran out are
sharply divided over what to do next.
   The World Wildlife Fund, a conservation group and China's main
foreign partner in panda research, recently turned to the U.S.
courts to determine if Chinese panda loans to American zoos are
exploitative, as it says, or educational, as China says.
   Some Chinese and Western experts say China should do more to
breed captive pandas, while others say the only solution is to move
humans from panda reserves.
   Even the size of the panda population is under debate. The World
Wildlife Fund is preparing to release survey results that put the
number of pandas in the wild at 1,100 to 1,500, startlingly higher
than previous estimates.
   A 1977 Chinese survey put the figure at 1,000, and the
population is known to have dropped since then due to poaching and
a shortage of the panda's favorite food, bamboo.
   Ken Johnson, a University of Tennessee zoologist who led the
survey, says the earlier count was sloppy and too conservative.
   But Zhou Shoude, the deputy director of China's largest panda
reserve, the 800-square-mile Wolong Nature Reserve near Chengdu in
Southwestern China, discounted Johnson's figures, which were based
largely on a count of panda nesting areas and droppings.
   The experts agree, however, that the panda is steadily
decreasing in number and that five years after an international
alert went out to save it, the outlook is grim.
   ``There are more pandas than we expected,'' Johnson says, ``but
they are more critically endangered than we expected.''
   Pandas, black-and-white bear-like animals that some say are
related to the bear and some say to the raccoon, are native only to
China. Experts believe their ancestors lived 20 million years ago,
contemporaries of the mastodon and other extinct species.
   A few hundred years ago, pandas still roamed the lowlands. But
humans gradually pushed them into the mountains of western China's
Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, the only places they now live
in the wild.
   World attention was drawn to their plight in 1983 when their
dietary staple, arrow bamboo, flowered and died as it does every 40
or more years. The World Wildlife Fund collected more than $4.1
million toward saving the animal, and the Chinese government and
citizens contributed millions more.
   More than 62 animals starved before the bamboo began growing
again a few years later.
   That crisis over, experts are looking more critically at China's
conservation program. They acknowledge China's limited resources,
praise its good intentions and press for more action _ without
agreeing on the best course.
   ``Except for the pandas, there's not a lot that's black and
white about it,'' Ken Cook, a spokesman for the World Wildlife
Fund, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   China is dealing sternly with one obvious problem _ poaching.
Its highest court last year ordered panda killers be given long
prison terms or even the death sentence.
   China has been less decisive, however, in dealing with another
human problem _ ordinary peasants. Their encroachment on the rare
animal's turf, including inside China's 12 panda reserves, advances
steadily.
   More than 4,000 peasants live in Wolong, which became a showcase
for panda conservation in 1980 when the World Wildlife Fund helped
build a breeding center there. The peasants' terraced corn and
potato crops climb high up the slopes of mountains roamed by pandas.
   Johnson believes the peasants must be moved _ if not from
Wolong, then from other reserves.
   ``They've already destroyed Wolong, essentially,'' he says.
Human settlements have marooned the pandas in small groups on
mountain tops, preventing them from mingling in the mating season
and creating the danger of localized inbreeding, he says.
   Johnson's solution is to move humans from critical areas and
plant corridors of trees and bamboo between panda habitats so they
can roam freely and mate naturally _ something he said pandas have
no trouble doing in the wild.

   Chinese officials, while agreeing in theory, show no signs of
acting. Wolong's deputy director, Zhou, says he tries to
``educate'' the peasants in the hope they will leave voluntarily,
but he has no fallback plan if they don't.
   Johnson dismissed breeding centers, artificial reproduction and
Chinese efforts to develop test-tube pandas, saying, ``We don't
have that much time.''
   However, other scientists believe wild pandas cannot be saved in
adequate numbers, and that breeding centers are needed to
re-populate the forests. Here, too, China's program falls short.
   ``You need one person who knows exactly where all the pandas are
and their histories,'' says Devra Kleiman, assistant director of
research at Washington's National Zoo.
   Captive pandas, kept mainly in pairs in zoos, should instead be
kept in large breeding centers where they would have greater
chances of finding compatible mates, she says. At a minimum, she
adds, zoos should cooperate in breeding their pandas.
   William Conway, director of the New York Zoological Society and
designer of the Wolong breeding center, agreed on the need for two
or three national breeding centers where pandas could be carefully
managed in an accelerated propagation program.
   But Chinese zoos cooperate little. The Forestry Ministry, in
charge of conservation, said it does not even keep count of how
many pandas are in captivity in China. Official media reports say
there are more than 80.
   Wolong, with eight captive pandas, puts males and females
together only for the brief spring mating season, as do many zoos.
Then, relative strangers and unable to act out their elaborate
mating rituals of the wild, the pandas are notoriously uninterested
in romance.
   According to Chinese count, captive pandas worldwide have
produced fewer than three dozen surviving cubs.
   ``I don't think anyone is pleased with the progress that has
been made in captive breeding,'' Cook says. He said the fund was
disappointed that the breeding facility it helped build in Wolong
had only produced one panda, born in 1986.
   Wang Menghu of the Forestry Ministry says breeding has suffered
from too little equipment and trained staff.
   But he says China's efforts compared well with other countries,
noting that few Western zoos with pandas have been able to produce
surviving offspring.
   It was breeding and money that dragged the panda into the U.S.
courts.
   In a suit still pending, the World Wildlife Fund and American
Association of Zoological Parks and Museums accused the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service of allowing commercial exploitation of pandas
on loan to U.S. zoos from China.
   Six U.S. zoos have borrowed separate pairs of pandas for short
periods, paying China up to $500,000 and in turn reaping millions
in ticket and concession sales. Dozens of other zoos are hotly
competing for pandas.
   ``Our concern was that the number of loans was increasing
sharply,'' Cook says.
   The lawsuit failed to stop the loan of two Wolong pandas to the
Toledo, Ohio, zoo in May. However, the Fish and Wildlife Service
refused to let another panda pair be shown at the Michigan State
Fair, saying it would disrupt their breeding in China.
   It also suspended consideration of future panda loans, including
one planned for the Atlanta Zoo for September, while it works out a
new policy. Among other things, the service said it wants proof
China uses the fees it gets for conservation.
   China's government has not responded, but its Association of
Zoological Gardens announced a ban on panda loans where foreign
organizations might profit, implying the commercialism was on the
other side.
   Wang, of the Forestry Ministry, said the halt in panda loans was
America's loss. ``It makes no difference to us,'' he says. ``It's
not as if China goes around saying, `Will you take a panda?'''
   But Cook says he hopes the suit will make a difference, by
ending China's loans of breeding-age pandas and requiring U.S. zoos
to use panda revenues for conservation.
   ``We are not optimistic about the species right now,'' he says.

   In a pioneering program begun a year ago at a
Cleveland clinic, doctors are making infertile women pregnant by
taking eggs from a volunteer donor, fertilizing them with the sperm
of the recipient's husband and implanting the eggs in the
recipient's uterus. There have been some successes and some
failures, but the director of the program says, ``We're on the
right track.''

   Two women told repeatedly they were hopelessly
infertile because they lack ovaries have become pregnant through an
anonymous egg donor program.
   To protect their privacy, the Cleveland Clinic has closely
guarded the identities of the two women, describing them only as in
their early 20s, one a housewife and another a farm wife. One lives
in Ohio, the other in another state.
   ``These are women who have been told for years and years they
would never get pregnant,'' says Dr. Martin M. Quigley, who directs
the program at the clinic. ``They were as sterile as you could
get.''
   The two women are the first successes in a program that involves
taking eggs from a volunteer, fertilizing the eggs with the sperm
of the recipient's husband and implanting the fertilized egg in the
recipient's uterus.
   ``As far as we know, we are the only people in the world that
have a voluntary, anonymous egg donor program,'' Quigley says.
   Since the program began a year ago, eight women have undergone
fertilized egg implants. In addition to the two pregnancies, four
women have failed to become pregnant so far and two are awaiting
pregnancy tests.
   ``We're on track,'' Quigley says.
   When the program was announced, the Cleveland Clinic received
500 inquiries in the first week, more than 90 percent of them from
women interested in donating eggs to infertile women.
   Unlike sperm donors for artificial insemination, ``Women's eggs
are a heck of a lot more difficult to come by than men's sperm,''
Quigley says.
   The clinic invited 68 women to go through a rigorous donor
screening program which includes a medical history, psychological
evaluation, detailed briefing on the procedure and the possible
risk and a review by an ethical expert who makes sure the donor
understands everything.
   A key part of the program, Quigley says, involves matching egg
donors and recipients to try to provide women with babies similar
in physical appearance to what they might have expected if they had
become pregnant naturally.
   ``The matching has been incredible,'' Quigley says.
   He recalls that one day one of his aides familiar with one of
the women in the matchup was able to pick out the other woman as
she waited in a cafeteria line because they looked so much alike.
   He says the screening also weeds out donors who might have
sexually or genetically transmitted diseases.
   The clinic and its staff make no promises about the type baby
that might result. A recipient consent document also warns that
``there is no guarantee the recipient will become pregnant.''
   The procedure usually takes about 20 minutes and can be
uncomfortable, Quigley says. Donors are offered a painkiller.
   The eggs are combined with the sperm and up to three of the
fertilized eggs are inserted into the would-be mother. Using more
than three at a time would increase the chances of a multiple
birth, Quigley says.
   Donors are paid $900 to $1,200 for their time involved in the
screening, subsequent blood testing and the actual egg collection.
``We're certainly not paying for eggs,'' Quigley says.
   If the recipients become pregnant, they face up to 12 weeks of
hormone treatments because they lack the ovaries needed to control
the hormonal body changes required to maintain a pregnancy.``We
have to maintain the pregnancy artificially,'' Quigley says.
   Lori Andrews, an expert on reproductive law with the American
Bar Foundation in Chicago, says ``we could see a case'' in which a
woman who donated eggs as part of her own attempt to become
pregnant through in vitro fertilization might sue for visitation
rights with a baby created with her donor eggs.
   But Quigley's program faces less risk of such legal problems,
she says, because donors are volunteers who are paid only for their
time and effort. He said they have no hope themselves of becoming
pregnant through in vitro fertilization.
   The only law in the nation regulating egg donations was enacted
in Louisiana to prohibit payments to a donor, Ms. Andrews says.

   Gary Cole, about to make his TV series debut,
admits he still harbors some of the stage actor's prejudice against
television.
   Cole, who lives in Chicago where he's a member of the
Steppenwolf Theater, stars in NBC's new ``Midnight Caller,'' which
will makes its bow in November. He plays a former San Francisco
police officer who continues to fight crime as host of a late-night
call-in radio show.
   He'll also be seen this fall in the NBC movie tentatively called
``Daddy'' as a new father suddenly faced with raising his newborn
son alone after his wife dies in childbirth.
   Cole is perhaps best known to television viewers for his
performance as Green Beret doctor Jeffrey MacDonald _ who was
convicted of killing his wife and two daughters _ in the 1984
miniseries ``Fatal Vision.''
   ``Sure, I've had prejudices against television,'' he says. ``I
still do.''
   But, he adds, ``There is quality television around.''
   As for his new series, he says, ``I hope that it relies on
character as well as on how it looks. I want it to have quality and
be gripping.''
   So far, Cole's only work on the series has been the pilot.
During the writers' strike he went back to Chcago, but recently
returned here for ``Daddy.'' Work on the movie was completed in
early September and he was off to San Francisco to start ``Midnight
Caller.''
   ``I'm grateful for the opportunity to do a series,'' he says,
``but it's hard to know how to feel until it becomes a reality.''
   Cole was doing ``Landscape of the Body'' at the Goodman Theater
in Chicago when he was signed for ``Midnight Caller.''
   ``The play was winding up a four-week run and I pulled out the
last week,'' he says. ``But I got a few days off from the pilot and
flew back to Chicago to finish the play's run.''
   Cole plays Jack Killian in ``Midnight Caller.'' He is still a
San Francisco plainclothes inspector nicknamed ``The Mouth'' as the
pilot opens.
   ``What happens is that he accidentally kills his partner during
a shoot-out,'' he says. ``By his own choice he decides to stop
being a policeman. Then he's offered this call-in radio show about
crime prevention. It's people calling in about drug-selling in
their neighborhood, battered wives, even a guy I busted as a
policeman who calls in to harass me over the air.
   ``The pilot's about finding a female serial killer. She kills
men. Married blond men. Then she begins to call the station. We try
to trace the call. She winds up contacting me at home and we set up
a meeting.''
   Other regulars in the series are Wendy Kilbourne as the station
owner, Dennis Dun as the producer-engineer and Arthur Taxier as his
former boss and now his conduit to the police.
   Cole can't yet pin down Killian's character. ``But the fact that
he's called `The Mouth' suggests to me he's outspoken and
aggressive,'' he says. ``I think he's a little off-center. He's got
a good sense of humor and he's outrageous on radio. When we filmed
the radio scenes some of the questions were just thrown at me and I
ad-libbed the answers.''
   Cole grew up in the Chicago area, and for as long as he
remembers wanted to be an actor. As an 8-year-old, he lip-synced
Bill Cosby's comedy albums. He studied acting at Illinois State
University, but left after three years to return to Chicago to work
as a bartender, house painter and occasional actor at the
Steppenwolf Theater. He joined the Remains Theater in 1979 and then
became an ensemble player with Steppenwolf in 1986.
   ``Steppenwolf has a company of 21 actors,'' he says. ``Some of
the people have been working together since 1976. I knew most of
them in college.''
   His first film work was as Peter Strauss' younger brother in the
TV movie ``Heart of Steel,'' which told of the effect the closing a
steel mill had on a community.
   The turning point was his appearance in ``Fatal Vision.'' ``I
was doing Sam Shepard's play `True West' in New York and some NBC
people saw it,'' he says. ``NBC talent reps came to Chicago looking
for people for pilots and I talked to them. I talked to them again
when I did `Miami Vice.' About three months later I got the role in
`Fatal Vision.' It turned out well. It got me in places I might not
have gotten into before.''
   Last year he starred in Joseph Wambaugh's ``Echoes in the
Darkness,'' based on a murder case in Pennsylvania. He played a
state police homicide investigator whose dogged work over seven
years helped solve the case.
   He's also appeared on ABC's ``Moonlighting'' and on ``The
Twilight Zone.''

   Julie Harris, who has spent much of the last
seven years in television, has come home to the theater and a
yearlong tour in ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Not that she had deserted the stage completely while toiling on
the CBS nighttime soap opera ``Knots Landing.'' Between seasons as
the vulnerable, often silly and very southern Lilimae Clements on
television, Miss Harris found time for short theater engagements,
particularly in her one-woman shows based on the lives of Emily
Dickinson and Charlotte Bronte.
   But ``Knots Landing'' occupied most of her career until she was
written out of the show last fall. When last seen on the program,
she and Red Buttons were riding off into the sunset in a motor home.
   Now the actress is on the road for real, this time in a tour
that began in Detroit after Labor Day and will end next summer in
Los Angeles. Why submit to the rigors of touring?
   ``It's a perfect play,'' Miss Harris says in describing
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' which chronicles the 25-year relationship
between an elderly Atlanta widow and her black chauffeur.
   ``There's an absolute truth about it,'' she adds. ``It's
well-conceived and well-constructed. It's like when you look in one
of those small boxes and there are colors changing all the time.
That's the way working on something like this is. It's
never-ending: The little feelings that eddy out from all the scenes
go into the next scene.''
   The play, still running off-Broadway at the John Houseman
Theater, was a first effort by Alfred Uhry and won the 1988
Pulitzer Prize for drama. Touring with Miss Harris are Brock Peters
as the chauffeur and Stephen Root as her exasperated son.
   Uhry modeled the woman after his grandmother, an elementary
school teacher. He and Miss Harris talked at length about the woman
who died in 1973 at the age of 95. He relayed bits and pieces of
the woman's life to give the actress a better understanding of her
character.
   ``For instance, he told me that his grandmother's curiosity was
such that when she was reading she always had the dictionary beside
her,'' Miss Harris recalls. ``She would look up words she didn't
know, be carried away by what she was reading in the dictionary and
would end up reading that.''
   Miss Daisy is only the latest in a long parade of characters
that the actress has brought to life on stage. She has won five
Tony awards for her efforts.
   She found small jobs in the theater when she first moved to New
York in the mid-1940s.
   ``I was sort of a young character actress so there was a niche
for me _ the oddball girl,'' she recalls.
   Miss Harris astonished Broadway in 1950 when she played the
lonely 12-year-old tomboy Frankie Addams in Carson McCullers' ``The
Member of the Wedding.'' She was 24 at the time. Her co-star was
Ethel Waters in what many consider her greatest role.
   ``Ethel Waters was a phenomenon of nature,'' Miss Harris
recalls. ``She was like the force of Niagara Falls. I've never
experienced that same power from any other actress.''
   The next year she won her first Tony award as the amoral
hedonist Sally Bowles in ``I Am a Camera,'' adapted from
Christopher Isherwood's ``Berlin Stories.'' Other Tonys arrived for
her portrayals of Joan of Ark in ``The Lark,'' a 40-year-old
divorcee falling for a younger man in ``Forty Carats,'' Mary Todd
Lincoln in ``The Last of Mrs. Lincoln'' and poet Emily Dickinson in
``The Belle of Amherst.''
   Miss Harris carries on in the old tradition of such acting
greats as Katharine Cornell and Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne,
performers who go out on the road with their shows.
   ``I guess nothing could intimidate me anymore because I did `The
Belle of Amherst' for so long in huge barns, in tiny theaters, in
middle-size theaters and on basketball floors,'' she adds.
   ``I even did six weeks of one-night stands,'' Miss Harris says.
``There was no time to adjust. You just slap the makeup on and do
it. Some antenna tells you: `too much voice' or `too little
voice.'''
   That instinct for acting was born early.
   ``I once heard an interview with Laurence Olivier who said both
his parents loved the theater and so he `inherited the wish,''' she
says. ``That was his expression. I think I did, too, because both
my parents adored the theater and took us to the theater and talked
about the theater.''
   By the time she was 14, she knew she wanted to be an actress.
   ``My parents were very tolerant,'' she says. ``I don't think
they took it seriously, although I did.''
   Miss Harris still does, even after more than four decades of
acting.
   ``I try to be adventurous, especially in rehearsal,'' she says.
``I must try it, and something will happen from trying it, even if
what I'm doing doesn't succeed. I've learned the value in saying
`yes' to everything. Eventually, you may have to say `no,' but say
`yes' first.''
   That sense of adventure extends to looking for new works, too.
Today, she spends a lot of time reading scripts.
   ``Now I've taken an idea for a play to the Long Wharf Theater
(in New Haven, Conn.) and they've commissioned it to be written for
Jason Robards and me,'' Miss Harris says. ``The play's about James
Joyce and his wife. Donald Freed will write it, but I won't be able
to do it until late next summer at the very earliest. But then,
part of the excitement of life is to work on something new.''

<HEAD>Story Behind `Diamond Trap' Almost as Intriguing as Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Diamond Trap,'' which leads off the
season for the ``CBS Sunday Movie'' on Sept. 25, has career risks,
corporate intrigue, tragedy and triumph. And a lot of it took place
before the cameras rolled.
   The movie stars Brooke Shields, Twiggy, Howard Hesseman and Ed
Marinaro, but the gold stars for putting it all together go to the
executive producer, Jay Bernstein.
   Bernstein, a former publicist and top Hollywood agent who
boosted the careers of such performers as Linda Evans and Farrah
Fawcett, is not likely to produce ``The Mother Teresa Story.''
   It would be too easy. Big script, big stars, lots of easy
production money.
   Instead, Bernstein took a regulation thriller based on the novel
``The Great Diamond Robbery'' from mystery novelist John Minahan
and insisted on Miss Shields and Twiggy as the female leads for the
script, which had been revised eight times over 2{ years by writer
David Peckinpah.
   Bernstein claims one of the best industry records for television
movies, with the seven he has done so far averaging a 33 share, and
none lower than a 31 share, the term used by A.C. Nielsen to
describe the percentage of the overall TV audience viewing a
particular show.
   He knows how to hit the right audience buttons or, in his words,
``Put the sizzle in the steak.'' But wanting Miss Shields for the
part and getting her were two different things.
   He made a point of going to this year's ``People's Choice''
awards to put the script in her hand. The role for Miss Shields was
that of a gallery employee who is part of a plot to steal $12
million in jewels, but the police, including Twiggy as a Scotland
Yard detective, persuade her to help them foil the crime.
   The part of the sophisticated 30-year-old would be the first
adult role for Shields, a 23-year-old Princeton honors graduate.
She wanted it.
   But not everyone wanted her. She had to read for the role, for
Bernstein, for director Don Taylor, for CBS and for Columbia, an
unusual demand on someone who has already commanded major film
roles.
   ``Certain people involved in the production were so worried
about how to deal with a, quote, `movie star' on a 22-day shooting
schedule that the final compromise was to put part of my salary in
escrow,'' said Bernstein in an interview. ``If there was a problem,
the first money to be lost would be mine.
   ``I told Brooke I was going to do this and she said, `Don't
worry, I won't let you down,''' he said.
   ``Not only did she not let me down, she made me very proud. She
is one of those people ... who everybody waits for to fail. And
she's succeeded,'' said Bernstein. He called Miss Shields ``easy to
work with and able to turn in a fine performance, even with all
this pressure on her.''
   There were other perils. The project came to CBS just as the
network leadership was going through a shakeup, with CBS
Entertainment President Donald Grant leaving the network and Kim
LeMasters replacing him.
   ``It was about to be caught between the switches,'' said
Bernstein. ``There was something CBS wanted from me, and it was
hard to give, but I went in and gave it to them,'' said Bernstein.
He didn't identify the sacrifice, but most likely it was a
different movie or series project.
   ``And then I asked them for a favor afterward. `Please let me do
this and I won't let you down.' And now it's their leadoff movie,''
Bernstein said.
   But even after getting a green light, there was the matter of
financing..
   ``The problem was the picture was too expensive to make,''
Bernstein said. ``This picture was filmed in Los Angeles, New York,
Bristol, Bath, Wales and London, with four major stars, each of
whom could be star of their own TV movie.''
   In the midst of grappling with finances, Bernstein's father,
Jerome, died of complications from a heart condition April 17.
Bernstein has dedicated the movie to his father.
   ``At the time my father died, the picture was falling apart,''
Bernstein recalled. ``On the day of my father's funeral, a person
from CBS said to me, `Don't worry, it's going to work out.' And
another person from Columbia said the same thing. And they did it.
   ``That means there are people functioning in these corporations.
They don't get an opportunity very often to express their emotions,
because everything is the bottom line. But I've seen CBS and
Columbia come through big, twice,'' said Bernstein. He also got the
studio and the network to restore the ``Mike Hammer'' series to the
air after star Stacy Keach was imprisoned in England on cocaine
charges.
   ``The Diamond Trap'' faces the Olympics on NBC and probably a
broadcast of the movie ``Romancing the Stone'' on ABC, so Bernstein
knows he will not match the previous shares he has gained for
television movies.
   ``Whatever I get (in ratings share), I would have gotten only
half of it without these two women,'' Bernstein said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Eight Men Out''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It seems unthinkable today that a major league baseball team
could conspire to throw the World Series. But it happened in 1919.
   ``Say it ain't so, Joe,'' were the words that echoed through
history when the infamous ``Black Sox Scandal'' was mentioned.
   Writer-director John Sayles takes his cue from that line spoken
by a young boy in fashioning ``Eight Men Out,'' a movie that is
incisive, touching and instructive without appearing to be a
history lesson.
   As the tragedy of the scandal unfolds, two young boys who
idolized the players and cadged dimes to buy tickets to games
become symbolic of the baseball fans whose dreams were tied to the
champion Chicago White Sox team that seemed a shoo-in to beat the
Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.
   We meet the players at the height of their success, a team with
the grace of ballet dancers, the naivete of children and the
winning force of a steamroller. Hailed by the media and worshiped
by fans, they are in constant conflict with the team's stingy
owner, Charles Comiskey, a fine bad guy portrayal by Clifton James.
   When sleazy gamblers including the infamous Arnold Rothstein
(Michael Lerner) propose ``fixing'' the World Series, most team
members are vulnerable. David Strathairn is a memorable example as
Eddie Cicotte, the aging pitcher who is denied a bonus and agonizes
over selling out for his family's sake.
   In true ensemble form, all of the performances are top rate.
D.B. Sweeney is touching as the talented country boy Shoeless Joe
Jackson whose inability to read or write makes him prey to
corrupting pressures. It is he who turns away sadly from the
child's plaint, ``Say it ain't so, Joe.''
   As the fix sets in, we see the expert players expertly losing
game after game. In the press box, journalist Ring Lardner, coolly
portrayed by John Sayles himself, and Hugh Fullerton, adeptly
played by Chicago writer Studs Terkel, become sadly aware that the
team, soon to be derisively tagged ``The Black Sox,'' has been
corrupted.
   The case leads to formation of the baseball commission and
appointment of the first commissioner, Judge Kenesaw Mountain
Landis (John Anderson) who punished all involved team members _
even those who didn't actively participate in the scam _ by barring
them from professional baseball forever.
   This is a must-see film for baseball fans and an instructive
entertainment for the rest of us. As writer, director and actor,
Sayles hits three home runs.
   ``Eight Men Out'' is rated PG.

   ``Just Before the Bullets Fly'' (Epic) _ The Gregg Allman Band
   
   Fans of the Allman Brothers won't be disappointed with founding
brother Gregg's latest solo effort, which echoes the patented
Southern sound of the original group and paints a lyrical portrait
of a rocker who has survived.
   Allman's bouts with various chemicals are well-known, and on
``Just Before the Bullets Fly'' he deals with that image right off
the bat. The first cut, ``Demons,'' has him singing, ``But oh, he's
got his demons@And they stay right by his side@Through his everyday
hell, yeah.''
   Later, on ``Oceans Awash the Gunwale,'' he credits the music
itself for saving him: ``Once more we're cheating on the
reaper@With all the gypsy still in our souls@Cause I know there's a
God up there somewhere@Who must love rock and roll.''
   And it's the music, particularly Allman's throaty blues vocals,
that keeps ``Just Before the Bullets Fly'' interesting.
   Guitarist Dan Toler, formerly of Dicky Betts' Great Southern
band, is the other major creative force here. His blues-rock licks
are predictable: lots of long, ringing guitar solos that recall
Gregg's late brother, Duane Allman. But it's become a classic sound
and Toler pays homage well.
   The title song, ``Demons,'' ``Can't Get Over You'' and a new
version of ``Every Hungry Woman'' are vintage Allman-style blues.
And Gregg sings with a power and range you won't find on anything
he's done since ``Eat a Peach.''
   A couple of other songs fail. An attempt at jazz-rock, ``Thorn
and a Wild Rose,'' sinks beneath the weight of its wash of
synthesizers and mushy metaphorical lyrics. And a pop song, ``Night
Games,'' forces Allman to try to sing bouncily _ and that's not his
strength.
   But the rollicking, guitar-piano-and-organ sound that fans of
the original Allmans know by heart, is alive and kicking on ``Just
Before the Bullets Fly.'' And so is a rock 'n' roll warrior, Gregg
Allman.

   ``Big Dreams in a Small Town'' (RCA) _ Restless Heart
   
   The problem with this kind of country-by-committee approach is
that by the time everyone gets through, the result is much like a
modern-day political platform _ it sounds nice enough, and it won't
offend anybody, but it's nothing to inspire the masses.
   With ``Big Dreams in a Small Town,'' Restless Heart gives us an
album with 12 songwriters, seven producers, five vocalists, nine
songs _ and, as a result, no focus.
   These five former Nashville session players have lodged
themselves firmly in the Alabama-Oak Ridge Boys league, with mellow
harmonies and professional musicianship. But while those groups
have managed to meld into a distinctive identity, Restless Heart
too often sounds like that staple of old-style country music shows
_ the band playing a couple of tunes before the star takes the
stage.
   ``The Bluest Eyes in Texas,'' the current hit off this
collection, is as good an example as any. What begins with a nice
piano introduction from the classically trained David Innis soon
enough settles into nice harmonies that eventually pull lead singer
Larry Stewart _ who really can sing _ into a nice vanilla morass.
   The first half has its moments: Innis with some crafty pop piano
on ``Say What's in Your Heart,'' reminiscent of the early Billy
Joel; and a solid group effort on the title cut, a quintessential
example of country pop.
   But things start to get a little adventurous in the second half,
and not to good effect, either: a crowded swamp-Western-Indian
air-of-mystery motif for ``Eldorado,'' and an unfortunate try at
funkiness in ``This Time.''
   With so many talented singers running around, Restless Heart
still needs to find its voice _ or at least a chairman of the board.

   ``The Hits'' (Epic) _ REO Speedwagon
   
   REO Speedwagon has several strikes against it: banal lyrics,
bland musicianship, the lack of a distinctive band personality.
   But they are unpretentious about their abilities _ no concept
albums, no ``save the world'' singles, no 20-minute guitar solos.
They just try to make hit singles and have often succeeded.
   The songs on ``Greatest Hits'' are at worst, uninteresting, and
at best, instantly hummable. REO Speedwagon has lasted 20 years
with only a couple of personnel changes, and the songs on
``Greatest Hits'' date from 1973 to the present.
   The band's limitations and strengths are typified by lead singer
Kevin Cronin. He isn't terribly soulful, but Cronin doesn't pretend
to have a great voice and he handles fast songs and ballads equally
well.
   The three best songs come from 1980's best-selling ``Hi
Infidelity'': ``Keep on Loving You,'' ``Take It on the Run'' and
``Don't Let Him Go.'' All have strong melodies and plenty of
harmonies. They don't hold up under close listening but sound good
on the radio and the beach.
   Also included are the earlier singles, ``Time for Me to Fly''
and ``Roll With the Changes,'' and their most recent hits, ``Can't
Fight This Feeling,'' and ``That Ain't Love.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Another TV Actor Tries the Big Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Oh, he's a television actor,'' is a common
Hollywood put down that Michael J. Fox, Tom Selleck, Bruce Willis
and Ted Danson have managed to overcome. Now Mark Harmon faces the
same sneer.
   The former Dr. Bobby Caldwell of ``St. Elsewhere'' has broken
through with two major films this summer: ``The Presidio,''
co-starring Sean Connery, and ``Stealing Home'' with Jodie Foster.
   ``The Presidio,'' a big-budget production that basically bombed
at the box office, featured Harmon as a San Francisco police
officer investigating a murder on an army base. In the more modest
``Stealing Home,'' he is a minor-league ballplayer on the skids,
returning to his boyhood roots. Much of the film is told in
flashbacks, and Harmon estimates he appears in only 30-35 minutes
of the 93-minute running time.
   ``I'd like to think that being a part of bigger pictures gives
you the opportunity to be a part of ones you feel more passionately
about,'' he said. ``They're the ones that almost didn't get made
for a lot of reasons.
   ```Stealing Home' is a project that has been around for seven or
eight years, long before I heard of it. It's a project that was the
passionate consideration and concern of Steve Kampmann and Will
Aldis, who wrote and ended up directing the piece as first-time
directors.''
   Last summer, Harmon made his movie debut as a star in the
raucous comedy ``Summer School,'' directed by Carl Reiner. He
called it a turning point.
   ``Before `Summer School,' nobody was knocking on my door and
saying, `Hey, we want Mark Harmon to star in a major motion picture
for a film company,''' he said. ``It was Carl Reiner who actually
took that by the horn and said, `This is the guy I want to play the
role.' The fact that Carl Reiner had that belief in me and was
indeed directing this summer fun movie made me willing to throw my
hat in the ring and say, `OK, let's try to make this thing work.'''
   Harmon was born into show business. His father is Tom Harmon,
1940 Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Michigan and a
prominent sportscaster. His mother is Elyse Knox, actress in such
1940s movies as Abbott and Costello's ``Hit the Ice'' and ``A WAVE,
a WAC and a Marine.''
   Still, he resists the notion that he grew up in Hollywood.
   ``It's safe to say that I grew up in California,'' he said.
``Certainly not Hollywood. Hollywood seems to me very mainstream,
something I'm not too attuned to and never have been; my folks sure
weren't. I'm much better staying on the edge of it. I begrudgingly
come into town when I have to. And yet I know this is where I work
right now.
   ``My mother had stopped being an actress by the time I was born.
I didn't even know much about my mom being an actress until I read
about it in film books. I was 7 years old before some kid in the
park told me that my dad was a world-class athlete and a great
football player. I went home and asked him. That's the reality of
how I was raised.''
   Harmon first achieved prominence as star quarterback for the
University of California at Los Angeles football team in 1972 and
1973. He was asked if there is any correlation between playing
football and acting.
   ``There's some,'' he said. ``I know as an athlete I never played
what I conceived as the perfect game, where everything went the way
it was drawn on the chalkboard. That's the reason I played. It
loved it; it was beautiful to watch when it all worked well.
   ``As an actor, I don't see ever doing a role that you can't make
better or change somehow. I like the fact that I can get up in the
morning and hopefully grow and be better than when I started in the
morning.
   ``Those are the same lessons I learned as an athlete. I don't
think it hurts to be competitive in this business. It's best to
work hard at what you do and try not to let the effort show.
Underneath it all I'm pretty tough, and that comes from being an
athlete.''
   Harmon made his acting debut in an episode of ``Ozzie's Girls''
and played 22 other TV roles before breaking into features with the
1979 ``Comes a Horseman.'' His greatest exposure came as the
AIDS-doomed doctor in ``St. Elsewhere'' and in the Coors beer
commercials. A marketeer for the company once claimed that Mark's
credibility ``is right up there with God and Walter Cronkite.''
   Harmon, 37, is unswayed by such comments or his selection by
People magazine as ``the sexiest man alive.'' Of his profession he
remarked:
   ``This is what I do. It's a job, and I respect it as that. It's
also about all I do. I have a family, and I used to be a
carpenter,'' said Harmon, who is building a family home at Big
Bear, a mountain resort about 90 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``If this all disappears tomorrow I know I can still build
houses.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Harlem Comes to Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI TAKETA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harlem street artist Franco the Great
bebops a bit as he daubs the finishing touches on the belt of a
dancing woman gyrating across a construction site fence.
   As he brings his own brand of Harlem to Japan, Franco Gaskin is
completely oblivious to the trucks roaring past, the summer sun and
the sweat beads streaking the lenses of his glasses.
   ``Nothing you do for love or beauty gonna die,'' he says, his
arms spreading wide to take in a 100-foot mural of black men and
women caught in the motions of the samba, the jitterbug and the
bump.
   ``I know the Japanese have a different picture of blacks. I want
them to understand the black people and their world.''
   It's an intoxicating vision for a self-taught artist, a sailor's
son who spent his boyhood in silence after a fall rendered him mute
for 12 years.
   To fill the void, Gaskin turned to art. After he recovered his
speech he moved to Harlem, where a decade ago he decorated his
first storefront riot grate. The depiction of a magnolia _ his
``Japanese blossom tree'' _ was the germination of the kind of
greatness to which a lonely boy aspired.
   The work led to calls from other storekeepers _ more than 150 so
far _ and a sort of international following after foreign travelers
began touring Harlem's avenues. Gaskin has demonstrated his
technique before African art classes and painted murals for French
municipalities.
   In July, he arrived in this Pacific port city, summoned by
Japanese developers who liked his raw style. Le Grand, as his
paint-spattered coveralls proclaim, was charged with injecting
American-style verve into a neglected suburb selected as the site
for an international shopping district.
   ``We chose Franco because he's very good for wall paintings,''
said Tatsuo Nannichi, a publicist for the Honmoku Development
Project. ``He worked in France, Italy, also Africa, and he's a very
international person. I think he's the symbol of New York.''
   The Panamanian-born Gaskin has a theme he calls ``Harmony Among
the Races.'' It has been a dream to paint it in Japan, where he
hopes to find sponsors who will provide a more permanent backdrop.
   ``When we look at racism, in my world I'm dealing with black and
white, but never with yellow, never with brown people, red
people,'' he says.
   ``Black and white is a contrast. But it takes three or more
colors to make harmony. And since Japan is a most powerful nation,
I figure it takes Japan to link a lot of people around the world.''
   The project must wait until his next visit. For now, Gaskin is
happy that he's made a start.
   ``I planted a seed in Harlem and now the seed has grown into a
beautiful tree,'' he said. ``I wanted Japan to share a little bit
of the black culture.''
   After two weeks' work, Gaskin's charcoal outlines were filled
with browns, oranges and magentas set off by a sky-blue backdrop.
His section of corrugated steel canvas runs along a four-lane
thoroughfare, side by side with other temporary murals by Japanese
artists and art students.
   In Gaskin's painted world, everyone is smiling. Silver sparks
fly from tambourines, elbows jut, hands clap, a good bit of thigh
shows as a chubby lady twirls her skirt.
   ``I don't know art well, but I feel this is live New York modern
art. Fantastic,'' said Kazuhiko Kitagawa, a bank clerk and Franco
fan. ``I saw his art in Harlem last year, and I met him. He was
wearing the same clothes.''
   On a recent Sunday, Gaskin presented a Franco Award to one of
the Japanese art students. Standing on a cloth-covered box in his
coveralls, his 6-foot-5 frame crowned by a colorful straw hat from
a nearby festival, Gaskin read the proclamation in stumbling
Japanese to the student, who shook his hand and scurried away.
   ``Japanese artists will get incentive from his art,'' Kitagawa
said. ``If Japanese paint, it becomes imitation. He is real art.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Personal Touch for Musical Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the musical gods were to
prophesize that a black woman who sang heart-tugging folk ballads
would top the charts in 1988, you'd figure it would be a very good
year for Joan Armatrading.
   After all, whoever heard of Tracy Chapman?
   But no one ever said the gods were fair. Armatrading, whose name
frequently comes up when critics talk about Chapman's work, is
still searching for that elusive hit 15 years and 13 albums into
her recording career.
   She quickly brushes off questions about the runaway success of
Chapman's debut record, saying she hasn't heard her music.
   A&M Records doesn't shy away, however. In advertisements for
Armatrading's new album, ``The Shouting Stage,'' the company says
that while hundreds of singers are compared to her, ``hundreds of
thousands of her fans knew she was there first.''
   The company is banking on the current mini-revival of the
singer-songwriter era to give Armatrading a long-sought boost to
stardom.
   ``Personally, I think it's unfair that Joan hasn't had the same
breaks that Tracy had,'' said Tom Corson, executive director of
product development for A&M. ``It's more of a question of timing.
Joan blazed the trails and Tracy's taken advantage of it.''
   Actually, there isn't much to the comparisons between
Armatrading and Chapman beyond the superficial similarities.
Chapman, in her debut album, features quiet, introspective folk
songs about love and society's treatment of the downtrodden.
   Armatrading sticks to personal politics, her emotionally intense
music an often exuberant mixture of rock, reggae, jazz and folk.
   The songs are so achingly personal that people often assume
they're all autobiographical, which would have given Armatrading a
pretty full emotional life over the past decade and a half.
   ``I think of it as a compliment, because the songs are written
to be believed,'' she said before one of the early dates in her
current U.S. tour. ``They're generally from something that's
happened. ... It's just that it's not necessarily from my things.
But I write it as if it's about me.''
   The new album's title cut comes from a magazine article that
theorizes every couple must go through a period of fighting to
achieve true intimacy, she said.
   The song is written in the voice of a woman addressing her lover
in the wake of this ``shouting stage,'' her tone veering between
resignation and vulnerability.
   More controversial is ``The Devil I Know,'' a searing indictment
of a ``wandering'' man from a woman trying to keep him close to
home that's already been taken to heart by many feminists.
   ``One chap said to me that the difference between men and women
is that men can distinguish between lust and love,'' she said. ``A
man can have a one-night stand or an affair that lasts a couple of
years and feel that he's being quite faithful to his real partner
because it's a purely sexual thing.
   ``It's women who have trouble thinking that if you go to bed
with someone you don't love them,'' she said. ``We'd like the two
to go together.''
   The song, she said, is about the age-old double standard that
seems to accept this behavior from men and condemn it from women.
   If someone thinks they've happened upon an album of men-bashing,
``The Devil I Know'' is immediately followed by the cheery ``Living
for You,'' about the happy side of being wrapped up in a
relationship.
   Armatrading's live show is packed with playful energy, almost
mocking the stereotypes of the singer-songwriter genre. She bounces
across the stage and trades some slightly choreographed dance steps
with saxophonist Jim Ross.
   The highlights come when she straps on an acoustic guitar for a
bluesy ``(I Love It When You) Call Me Names'' and a version of Van
Morrison's ``Moondance.''
   Her albums have become progressively harder-edged throughout the
1980s, but ``The Shouting Stage'' quiets things down a bit. It has
a highly produced, jazzy sound, benefitting from such studio stars
as Mark Knopfler and Alan Clark of Dire Straits.
   As much as she liked it at the time, Armatrading said she can't
listen to her 2-year-old album ``Sleight of Hand'' without pulling
the needle from the vinyl. Some of the songs, she admits, she finds
``irritable.''
   ``I was trying to write an album that I hope in a couple of
years' time people can sit and listen to just as much as they do
today,'' she said.
   Her record company will settle for people listening to it now.
Corson said he's encouraged by the company's sales performance in
the first few weeks of its release, though disappointed by radio's
continued reluctance.
   ``I think it's a time of opportunity for us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Turning Best Sellers Into Hot TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the seventh floor of London's Mayfair Hotel,
actress Lindsay Wagner was preparing the climactic scene in the TV
movie ``Voice of the Heart.''
   The one-time ``Bionic Woman'' faced a difficult moment: She must
persuade her on-screen lover, Nick (Neil Dickson), that her past
actions are less hateful than they once seemed.
   ``Do you need holding?'' asked director Tony Wharmby. Wagner
nodded ``yes,'' and Wharmby walked over to bolster her confidence
by hugging her.
   The scene is a buildup to the confession on which hangs the plot
of Barbara Taylor Bradford's 1983 best-selling novel, whose TV
version will be aired in two 2-hour segments this winter over
Britain's Independent Television Network and in the United States
on a network that has not yet been announced.
   The $8 million movie promises all the ingredients of high-class
soap opera: a web of romance and deception, exotic foreign
locations, and an emotionally storm-tossed heroine named Katharine
Tempest, played by Wagner.
   ``Voice of the Heart'' is the third Bradford book to be adapted
for the screen.
   She began writing 40 years ago at the age of 12 when, as a
youngster in an upper middle-class family in Leeds, England, she
sold her first story about a girl and her horse to a children's
magazine.
   ``I think my destiny was sealed,'' she recalled in an interview.
   
   However, her writing was put on hold while she set out to
experience life. ``I don't think you can earn a living at the age
of 16 writing novels.''
   In her eagerness to gain that knowledge, she shunned college and
became a typist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. She was promoted to
cub reporter in six months. A year later, at age 18, she became
women's page editor and by age 20 moved to London's renowned
newspaper row, Fleet Street. She married American film producer
Robert Bradford in 1963 and moved to New York. At the time, she was
writing a syndicated column on interior design that ran in 185 U.S.
newspapers. However, the desire to write fiction began to nudge
her. She started her first novel in 1970, and had started three
others by 1975.
   Then came ``A Woman of Substance,'' which she called the story
of ``a strong woman who makes it in a man's world when women were
not doing that.''
   ``When I started to write those initial pages, I really felt
very excited because I somehow knew in my bones ... this was the
book I was going to finish and the book that would be right,'' she
said.
   The hardcover version has sold more than 11 million copies since
1979, and the paperback topped The New York Times best-seller list
for 43 weeks. It also was made into an acclaimed syndicated TV
miniseries.
   Her second, ``Voice of the Heart,'' sold 2.5 million copies in
the United States. Her third, ``Hold the Dream,'' was also a best
seller.
   ``Voice of the Heart'' co-stars James Brolin as the dashing
actor-director Victor Mason and Victoria Tennant as Francesca
Cunningham Avery, the historical biographer who vies with actress
Katharine for Victor's affections.
   ``There's a whole person in there, and the person's hurting,''
said the 39-year-old Wagner in an interview halfway through the
10-week shooting schedule.
   ``I've got to humanize her, to make her emotionally accessible
to people,'' she said, looking sleeker and more composed than she
would later that afternoon when she donned a bathrobe to play the
frazzled Katharine.
   ``She's a very exaggerated kind of character in the fact that
she's eccentric and neurotic. ... In the story, if we don't
sympathize with her, then there's no pay-off at the end.''
   Victoria Tennant said she was drawn to the premise of the film.
   ``The drama pivots on a white lie that is told that seems
harmless to the liar and yet devastates the lives of everyone
involved,'' said the soft-spoken English actress.
   ``I think it's quite telling,'' she said of the plot idea.
``When you think of all the information that is being thrown at you
and how you deal with it, you think, ``That's not impossible. You
could hear something and it could change your life.'''
   ``Voice of the Heart'' is a contemporary drama, said the
elegantly coiffed Bradford, whose ``A Woman of Substance'' and
``Hold the Dream'' also were made into TV movies. They dealt with
the department store dynasty of Emma Harte, and starred Deborah
Kerr.
   ``It's very up-to-date; it's got a touch of the present,'' she
said. ``Katharine is one of those strange, mixed-up weird women.''
   Like Wagner, Bradford insisted that Katharine arouse sympathy.
``She's not a bitch,'' the writer said. ``She's a complex and
complicated woman and a marvelous actress, who has this frigidity
which all goes back to the time when she was molested as a child.''
   Although her novels have been filmed and a fourth, ``Act of
Will,'' is to follow, Bradford said: ``If I wrote a book with the
ultimate goal of a TV or movie screen, I think I'd be cheating the
reader.
   ``I'm actually competing with TV because I want to hold the
reader. I don't want the reader saying, `Oh, This is just a lot of
dialogue. I can't visualize any of it; I'm going to turn on `War
and Remembrance.'''
   She insists on having her husband as executive producer on all
her TV adaptations.
   ``A lot of Hollywood producers buy a best seller, keep the title
and throw the contents away,'' she said. ``Bob believes you put
on-screen the story that's in between those two covers.''

   Two Russian gospel singers are spreading a
message of Christianity and speaking out against communism, which
they say drove them from the Soviet Union.
   Nikolai Pankratz and his brother Peter are leaders of the
six-member, gospel-rock band Ruscha. The slick, hard-driving group
is on the road doing 150 concerts a year, playing mainly for
youngsters who hear 90 minutes of rousing music and then 15 minutes
of religious and patriotic messages.
   ``We are cruising across America, grabbing people by the neck
and saying, `Wake up. You've got it good but you are taking your
freedom for granted and you shouldn't do that. One day you may wake
up and be under persecution yourself,''' said 31-year-old Nikolai.
   ``People don't believe that will happen,'' he said. ``But we
grew up under communism, and we have a very great fear of it
spreading across the world.''
   The brothers said their family was persecuted in the Soviet
Union for being Christians and attending underground churches. In
1963, they said, the Soviet secret police came to their house and
took their grandfather away.
   ``He was dragged out in the deep snow in his pajamas,'' said
29-year-old Peter. ``He pointed toward heaven, meaning he'd see us
again. That's the last time we saw him. He arrived in a casket two
months later. He had frozen to death in Siberia.''
   The two said their family of eight, after four years of
negotiation, paid $3,000 a person to leave the country in 1974 and
relocate in Bonn, West Germany, where an aunt lived.
   ``There's no way to leave unless you sell everything you have,''
Peter said. ``We sold the only cow we had, the chickens we had, the
pigs we had. We sold our house and other people pitched in and
helped us financially.''
   From Germany, the brothers came to the United States on student
visas, Nikolai in 1978, Peter a year later. Learning English
without formal lessons, they studied at the Word of Life bible
institute in upstate New York for a year. They then enrolled at
Jerry Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., where they
received undergraduate degrees.
   ``He really helped us out,'' Nikolai said about Falwell. ``We
didn't know anything about America. He kind of took us under his
wing. Our whole life in this country started right there. We sang
in his church and on his TV show. He financed an album and got us
into his school.''
   The two have since decided to make their home in Dickson, about
40 miles west of Nashville.
   They first began performing under the name Russia but learned
that the name had a bad connotation in the United States. Because
of the name, their touring bus was vandalized several times.
   ``We got fed up and did something about it,'' Peter said.
``Americans don't realize there could be good Russians.''
   They changed the spelling to Ruscha.
   The two-year-old band now consists of the brothers plus
Americans Andy Denton, Michael Jackson, Billy Williams and Scott
Beck.
   Their debut album, ``Come Alive,'' was released earlier this
year. Their first single is ``Come Home,'' which has been No. 1 on
the gospel-rock charts in many cities.
   Their concerts are mostly in auditoriums and some in churches.
   ``We play some places no one else goes,'' Nikolai said. ``People
are getting to know us. That's pretty good.
   ``We want to get a message across through our music. It's a
vehicle. We try to tell the American people that people don't know
what it's like under communism. Also, we'd like to educate them
that it's a dangerous thing and that there is an answer to life:
God.
   ``What we are trying to do is what a lot of people of America
are failing to do: be able to grab kids' attention and say, `Don't
be a lazy bum. Support your government. Support your country. Stand
up for the rights of America.'
   ``If we're able to change the young people's attitude toward the
country, change their lifestyle away from drugs and alcohol and sex
and homosexuality, then I think we've done a whole lot more good
than 99 percent of the churches in America.''
   The brothers are not U.S. citizens, but this is a goal.
   ``We'd love that more than anything else,'' Peter said.

   Don't expect the Tower of Babel to tumble, but
computer scientists are breaking down language barriers with
machines that can translate languages in seconds and recognize
speech regardless of accent.
   ``Where can it lead to?'' said National Science Foundation
Assistant Director Bill Wulf. ``How big is your imagination?''
   Need to call Tokyo? Hotel switchboards, within a few years, will
be able to connect English-speaking callers to a special computer
that translates their words into Japanese, then responds by machine
in English.
   Stuck in a foreign hospital? Patients and doctors who speak
different languages will be able to communicate via computer in
about a decade.
   Traveling abroad and can't speak the language? Forget a
dictionary. Plan on packing a pocket translator.
   Too busy to type information into the computer? Just dictate.
   The list goes on and on, including eyeglasses for the deaf with
screens that provide transcripts of conversation, and the ability
to order merchandise like plane tickets by talking on the phone to
computers.
   ``One of the most distinguishing characteristics of human beings
is our ability to communicate,'' Wulf said. ``What you're seeing
here are techniques that improve that ability.''
   Companies are beginning to cash in on voice recognition programs
even while experts are trying to make the computers capable of
dealing with the ambiguity of human language, bad grammar and
different accents, among other things.
   ``We need to reduce the costs and increase the size of the
vocabulary and increase the capabilities,'' said Raj Reddy,
director of Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute. ``All of those
are yet to be solved.''
   ``What is there is obviously a very significant improvement over
what we used to know how to do even six months ago.''
   Dragon Systems Inc. of Newton, Mass., developed a program Xerox
Corp. used in 1986 to save nearly $10 million by inventorying all
2.2 million of its parts for the first time, said Dragon assistant
marketing manager Jonathan Robbins.
   The $100,000 system recognized 1,000 words. A 5,000-word program
is out, and a 20,000-word version is expected by early 1989, said
Robbins. Dragon also is working with the federal Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency to develop a voice-controlled jet fighter
cockpit.
   Kurzweil Applied Intelligence Inc. of Waltham, Mass., has
developed voice recognition systems for radiologists and emergency
rooms. Doctors dictate their reports to a computer, and the reports
are printed. The programs originally recognized 1,000 words, but
the vocabulary has been expanded to 5,000.
   More than 100 U.S. hospitals use the radiology system, VoiceRAD,
and about a dozen have VoiceEM for emergency rooms, said spokesman
Martin Schneider.
   Both Dragon and Kurzweil's systems require brief pauses between
words and must be trained to recognize each speaker.
   ``Most of us don't speak properly most of the time,'' said
Reddy, president of the American Association for Artificial
Intelligence. ``If you transcribe anybody's voice ... there are all
types of pauses and repetition, hums and haws, which we know how to
ignore. Computers don't know that yet.''
   ``Either we have to come up with ways to deal with (this) or we
have to teach people to speak right,'' said Kai-Fu Lee, a Carnegie
Mellon researcher who has developed a speech recognition system
known as Sphinx.
   It's a slow, complex task because human language is rife with
ambiguity, unlike mathematical, scientific or computer language.
   Take, for example, this sentence: ``The box is in the pen.''
   ``For humans, it's obvious because we all know that the box
cannot be in the writing pen (through) our unconscious kind of
common sense,'' said Masaru Tomita, associate director of the
Carnegie Mellon University Center for Machine Translation.
   ``If you want computers to do this, it's going to be very
difficult,'' Tomita said. ``The computers have to know the typical
size of a box and the typical size of a pen. One thing we can do
very quickly is that whenever the word `pen' appears, we can assume
it's a writing pen. But on the other hand, then the system will
make mistakes.''
   A classic example of machine misinterpretation involves the
epigram, ``The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.'' Early
translating systems turned that into, ``The vodka is good, but the
meat is rotten.''
   Lee's Sphinx, unlike earlier systems, can identify English words
spoken continuously. It boasts up to 96 percent accuracy
identifying 997 words, people don't have to spend hours training it
to recognize their speech patterns, and minor variations in accent
pose little problem.
   ``It's the first system that has all these capabilities,'' said
Lee, 26, who has been working on Sphinx for 1{ years, funded by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   Sphinx transforms spoken words from changes in air pressure into
changes in voltage. Each 10-millisecond slice of sound is assigned
a string of digits and, through a mathematical process, matched
with other sequences to yield the word with the best possible
meaning. So time isn't wasted searching the entire vocabulary,
Sphinx takes syntax into account.
   Tomita, 30, who plans to work this fall with Lee, has developed
a system capable of recognizing 100 words of doctor-patient
dialogue in Japanese, then translating the Japanese into English
uttered by a computer's speaker.
   The computer transforms the spoken Japanese into its written
equivalent, which is translated into written English and sent to
another part of the computer that generates English speech.
   Tomita also has devised a program that translates written
English or Japanese into written English, Japanese or German. A
hypothetical exchange between a doctor and patient _ ``I have a
headache'' or ``Take two aspirin'' _ is typed into the computer and
the translation appears within seconds.
   Like Sphinx, Tomita's 1,000-word systems consider context.
   He hopes to increase the programs' vocabularies and eventually
expand them to conversation used in making hotel reservations and
registering for conferences. His work is funded, in part, by IBM
Corp. of Tokyo.
   ``We need to pick some domain where it's very, very defined,
always clear what you're talking about,'' he said.
   The need for translating systems is considerable, especially for
those not fluent in English, according to Tomita, who counts
himself in that category.
   There are more than 3,000 world languages and dialects, said
Jaime Carbonell, director of the Center for Machine Translation.
   ``Americans don't seem to be aware of the fact that maybe 90
percent of the world population doesn't speak English at all,''
said Tomita. ``But everywhere you go, there is somebody who can
speak English.''
   Because of that smugness and sense of superiority as well as
insufficient funding, machine translation has received scant
attention in the United States since the 1960s, experts say. Most
work has been in Europe and Japan.
   ``The man on the street may or may not directly benefit from a
machine translation system,'' Wulf said. ``On the other hand, he
may benefit indirectly from American scientists being able to
interact better with the Russian or the Japanese or the French
scientists.''

   Computer scientists have machines talking, but
linguists and philosophers are in demand to help put the words in
their mouths.
   ``The last few decades have really seen a kind of merger of a
technical tradition in the humanities. That merger has created a
lot of opportunities,'' said Clark Glymour, head of Carnegie Mellon
University's philosophy department. ``More people are being drawn
into it, and not for the traditional reasons.''
   In general, ``programmers are a dime a dozen,'' Glymour said.
``What is needed are people who can take vaguely formed problems
and find ways to make them precise enough to be programmed.''
   American colleges and universities conferred 41,889 bachelor's
degrees in computer science and 40,521 in psychology during the
1985-86 academic year, the latest figures available from the
National Center for Education Statistics. That compares to 3,265 in
philosophy and 470 in linguistics.
   To help meet the demand for computer-conscious philosophers and
linguists, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh's
linguistics department have developed a doctorate program in
computational linguistics.
   The goal is to produce people who can do more than merely write
computer programs based on others' ideas, who can, in fact, develop
programs that better understand and emulate how humans talk and
think.
   ``You can't have really robust, healthy technology without a
science behind it, and we don't yet have the science,'' said
Richmond Thomason, professor of linguistics and philosophy at the
University of Pittsburgh. ``So what we have to do is learn enough
about human language and reasoning to understand what it is we're
trying to do once we get these machines to do something.''
   Sixteen students have been accepted into the program, one of
only a few in the world, in its two years of existence. Those
skilled in the area have landed high-paying, high-powered jobs,
unlike many of their more traditional brethren.
   ``There is a certain kind of stereotype about philosophy that's
quite popular,'' Glymour said. ``Think about what would distress a
parent more than to pay a hefty tuition and discover Sammy or
Samantha is going to study philosophy. The stereotype is a
completely impractical and perhaps an even self-indulgent endeavor.
   ``The fact of the matter is ... 20th century philosophy has
created through various pieces of work all kinds of technical
traditions.''

   A 70-foot dinosaur known as ``Happy'' stood
prominently on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History
for nearly 25 years before researchers discovered it was a new
species.
   Four months before it announced that finding in July, the museum
said it had discovered a new dinosaur, Nanotyrannus _ based on a
skull that had been in the basement for decades.
   This spring, a California researcher found the fossil remains of
a marine reptile called a Masasaur, so well-preserved that the 75
million-year-old animal still had scales on its skin and food in
its stomach. It was in a Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County warehouse.
   Paleontologists say the finds aren't surprising. Museum
storerooms have become rich hunting grounds for new species because
a lack of money and staff has delayed the identification of bones
excavated up to 60 years ago.
   ``In general, paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it
can be prepared,'' said Michael E. Williams, who helped identify
``Happy,'' a 140-million-year-old relative of the Brontosaurus.
``There are museums ... which have skeletons still in plaster
jackets going back to the turn of the century.''
   Researchers at the Cleveland museum had determined that
``Happy'' was a Haplocanthosaurus, but didn't realize it
represented a new and larger species _ and named it ``delfsi''
after the researcher who found the bones 30 years ago _ until they
recently had time to study it more closely.
   ``Literally there is so much material to collect and save from
weathering and erosion that we are just decades behind,'' said
Lawrence G. Barnes, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. ``I could walk in to
the Smithsonian or any museum and find 80 or 90 new species of
whales or dolphins, which is my specialty.''
   Barnes estimated that the museum had 300 to 400 plaster jackets
in storage, encasing everything from dinosaurs to mammoths, and
that 75 percent of the museum's collection has not been examined
closely.
   Even at the well-funded Smithsonian Institution, it took half a
century to study and identify fossils excavated by 19th century
dinosaur researcher O.C. Marsh that form the bulk of the museum's
collection, according to research curator Nicholas Hotton.
   ``When Marsh died, we got seven big, big train carloads of
dinosaur bones,'' Hotton said. Researcher C.W. Gilmor worked on
Marsh's fossils for nearly 50 years, and ``there is a bunch of
stuff Gilmor didn't get to.''
   Fossils stored at the Smithsonian have almost all been
identified, he said. ``We don't anticipate any surprises, but
that's silly because we can always get surprised.''
   Field Museum of Natural History researchers in Chicago have
spent 10 years working through the collection of unstudied fossils,
some of them in storage for decades, said John Bolt, chairman of
the geology department.
   ``We've made quite a bit of progress at reducing that backlog,''
Bolt said.
   Mary Dawson, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
in Pittsburgh, said some of the fossils still stored in plaster
jackets at the museum date to 1922. With only five paleontologists
on the staff, many of those blocks will have to remain in storage.
   Four years ago, a National Science Foundation grant let Carnegie
researchers open an old plaster block. They found the only known
complete hind foot of a stegosaurus.
   ``We liken our collection to an iceberg, with one-tenth above
the surface and the rest waiting for study,'' Miss Dawson said.
   Most of the work done at the museum is based on specimens the
researchers collect themselves, so much of the collection in
storage will remain unstudied, she said. ``We know we should stay
home and study the collections we already have, but it's such a
challenge to get out in the field.
   ``We're really putting apples back on the tree when we do this.''

   Doctors may be too quick to prescribe powerful new
cholesterol-reducing drugs with unknown long-term effects when
exercise, change of diet or more proven drugs might do as well,
specialists say.
   ``There is a general suspicion that some of the drugs that
control cholesterol are overprescribed, when diet and weight loss
alone may suffice,'' said Dr. James Willerson, professor of
medicine and chief of cardiology at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical School.
   If exercise and diet don't work in four to six months, drugs
ranging from the proven, like bile acid resins and niacin, to the
new, like gemfibrozil and lovastatin can be useful, said Dr. Wayne
Peters, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School
of Medicine.
   Lovastatin lowers the blood's low-density lipoprotein, which
delivers the cholesterol that builds up in the arteries.
Gemfibrozil increases the levels of high-density lipoprotein, which
carries cholesterol away to be destroyed.
   The two drugs ``are so easy to take, so impressive in their
effects on lowering cholesterol, that many physicians start out
with them first, which is not an NIH recommendation,'' Peters said
recently in Dallas.
   The National Institutes of Health has designated colestipol,
cholestyramine and nicotinic acid, or niacin, as drugs of first
choice. The first two are bile bile acid resins, which have been
been available for more than 20 years.
   ``The two newer drugs can also be considered,'' said Peters, an
assistant professor of medicine and preventative medicine and
biometrics who addresses doctors' groups and consumers on
cholesterol-lowering drugs.
   ``But most cholesterol experts think they should only be
considered after patients are using niacin and bile resins in small
doses.''
   Lovastatin ``is very effective in lowering the LDL component,''
he said. ``It is quite well tolerated, a pill like gemfibrozil. But
the longest it was used in humans is five years. We have really no
idea what the long-term safety record will be.
   ``Practicing physicians are overprescribing that medicine
without giving patients an informed choice... `Do you want a little
inconvenience but we know it's safe, or would you rather choose
convenience and a question mark as far as Lovastatin safety.'''
   Lovastatin was approved in 1987 by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   It can be very effective, Willerson said. ``Lovastatin is a very
important medication, but the newer cholesterol-fighting drugs are
very powerful, and it is important to be aware of what the options
are.''
   ``I think there are some problems in that area,'' said Dr.
Donald Hunninghake, director of the University of Minnesota Heart
Disease Prevention Clinic and author of the National Cholesterol
Education Program's adult drug therapy guidelines. ``These come
from many different areas.
   ``One is patients are not given adequate time or instruction on
diet. That is related to the fact that physicians are not familiar
with dietary therapy yet. The other is that many physicians are not
real familiar with the bile acid resins and nicotinic acid and do
not have a true feel for incidence of side effects and the number
of patients who can tolerate these drugs.''

<HEAD>Human Safety Trials Underway For AIDS Decoy Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first human trials have begun to test
the safety and proper dose of an experimental drug that may act as
a decoy to attract the deadly AIDS virus and prevent it from
invading human blood cells.
   About 50 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or
the less severe AIDS-related complex are participating in the
six-month studies of the drug, called rCD4, that began last month
at San Francisco General Hospital, New England Deaconess Hospital
and the National Cancer Institute.
   Tests of the drug's effectiveness against AIDS will begin only
after the safety and dosage trials are complete, the researchers
said.
   The drug is a manufactured version of CD4, a protein on the
surface of white blood cells, the main targets of the AIDS virus.
The virus infects white blood cells by latching onto the CD4
protein. Scientists hope injected rCD4 molecules might act as
decoys so AIDS virus particles in a patient's blood latch onto the
rCD4 instead of real CD4 on white blood cells.
   In that way, the drug might slow the virus' ability to spread
from cell to cell, thereby slowing or halting the progression of
AIDS in an infected person. It also might prevent white blood cells
from being infected if it is given immediately after a person has
gotten the virus in the bloodstream.

<HEAD>Aerial, Satellite Photos Can Locate Homes For Endangered Birds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Satellite images and aerial
photographs can provide a cheap way of finding South Pacific
islands suitable as new homes for endangered birds, a researcher
says.
   Janet Franklin, a graduate student in geography at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, said by using aerial
photos and computer-processed satellite images of the Cook Islands
she could distinguish tropical forest, swamp, brushland, fern
thickets and cultivated areas.
   Such information can be used to determine which isolated,
uninhabited islands are suitable for reintroduction and successful
reproduction of endangered birds, Franklin said.
   Habitat information is prohibitvely expensive to obtain from
field studies because because islands are spread over millions of
square miles of the western Pacific, she said. Aerial photos of the
Cook Islands can be bought for $2,500.
   Where aerial photos don't exist, satellite images can be bought
for about 10 times that amount, but that's still cheaper than
conducting on-the-ground field studies or new aerial surveys, she
said.
   In the past 2,000 years, Polynesian hunters eliminated or
sharply reduced populations of many land birds from many islands in
the South Pacific.
   ``That is no longer a problem, but the remaining birds are
threatened by habitat destruction as well as introduced predators,
particularly cats, rats and mongeese,'' said Franklin, who hopes to
protect endangered species by reintroducing them on uninhabited
islands where they once thrived.
   Franklin outlined her study Aug. 16 at an American Institute of
Biological Sciences meeting.

<HEAD>Permanent Voice Damage Can Result If Minor Laryngeal Injuries</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Untreated
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experiments on voice boxes removed from
cadavers suggest that minor injuries to the larnyx may cause
permanent damage to the voice if left untreated.
   Car crashes, chokeholds, strangleholds and other blunt-force
injuries often cause minor fractures to the cartilage framework of
the larynx, or voice box, which contains the vocal cords.
   Such fractures usually aren't treated unless they interefere
with breathing, said Dr. Robert Stanley, an assistant professor at
the University of Southern California School of Medicine.
   However, Stanley said his study suggests such fractures can
``cause long-term hoarseness or limit the range of pitch and pitch
control.''
   The fractures, while difficult to diagnose, can be detected by
CAT scans and treated by intricate surgery in which wires are
inserted into the voice box to restore proper alignment of
cartilage, Stanley said.
   In the USC study, voice boxes were removed from five dead people
and mounted on a special apparatus, both in their normal condition
and after minor injuries were simulated. Warm, humid air was passed
through the voice boxes in a manner similar to that in which a
person speaks.
   Analysis showed that even minor fractures reduced the efficiency

<HEAD>Jealousy May Be Positive, If Kept In Check</HEAD>

   Getting in touch with your feelings and
thinking positively about yourself are fine, but the best way to
stave off the pangs of jealousy are to just get on with your life,
two psychologists say.
   A positive attitude about yourself, or self-bolstering, seems to
be the best way to prevent the depression that could follow
jealousy, but doesn't do much to much to keep away envy or jealousy
itself, the researchers say.
   ``We like to think getting in touch with your feelings is a good
thing, that exploring how you feel will make you feel better,''
said Peter Salovey, a Yale University assistant professor of
psychology. ``But we found that strategy actually made you feel
worse in jealousy-producing situations.''
   Those who are jealous of others' success may long to curl up
with a bowl of ice cream while recalling every word of praise ever
uttered by family, friends and acquaintances, but that doesn't
help, said Salovey, who has studied jealousy for five years with
Yale professor Judith Rodin.
   ``Ignoring your feelings and getting on with your daily work and
striving even harder ... for what you want works better,'' Salovey
said.
   A third coping strategy, selective ignoring, works in the short
run by invoking the attitude, ``it's not so important to me
anymore,'' he said. ``But I suppose there is a limit to how many
times you can do that. Nothing is going to be important to you ...
if you employ it all the time.''
   Salovey and Rodin asked 95 Yale undergraduates in 1986-87 to
rate the frequency of jealousy-provoking situations involving
school, family, friends and romance, how jealous they felt and how
they coped. Their research will be published in the fall issue of
the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.
   Jealousy is the worry that something you have will be lost to
someone, and envy is wanting something someone else has. ``To the
extent they do not run your life, they may be healthy and
helpful,'' Salovey said.
   ``They are negative in what people is often a lot of anger,
sadness and occasionally fear. But in the sense they can also help
enrich our lives by letting us now what is important to us, that's
not so negative.''

   Unemployment climbed to 5.6 percent in August
as the number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 and a four-month
hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the

   Analysts said the news announced Friday reflected a softening
job market and was just the ``cold shower'' an overheating economy

   The report that more Americans were out of work
triggered a powerful rally on Wall Street as investors figured a
slowdown meant less inflation and lower interest rates.
   Stock prices leaped Friday and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks rose 52.28 points to 2,054.59, its biggest rise
since a 74.68-point gain on May 31. The bond market enjoyed its

<HEAD>Gold Swindles on Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of jittery investors are jumping
from the frying pan of a volatile stock market into the fire of
gold swindles pushed by high-pressure telephone sales operations,
state regulators said today.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association,
together with the Council of Better Business Bureaus, issued an
``investor alert'' warning of a rash of high-pressure, boiler-room
telephone scams promoting various schemes to buy gold at
below-market prices.
   ``We hope to alert the public to what is clearly the fraud du
jour _ one that has earned the title: the fool's gold rush of
1988,'' said James C. Meyer, president of the regulators' group and
director of the Tennessee Division of Securities.
   Project Goldbrick, a New Mexico-based task force established by
the regulators, began tracking eight scams in the spring of 1987.
Since then, Meyer said, the number of known operations has
mushroomed to 52.
   He estimated ``tens of thousands of Americans in all 50 states
will lose $250 million'' this year.
   ``It seems clear that the success of the new breed of gold
swindle is attributable in large part to the decline in investor
confidence since the Black Monday stock market crash of October
1987,'' Meyer said in a statement.
   ``Thousands of individuals fled the markets,'' he said. ``The
result: a huge pool of potential, cash-rich victims ripe for
exploitation.''
   The typical scheme, known as a ``dirt pile,'' works like this:
   A caller working from a boiler room telephone operation in
another state offers to sell, for instance, 100 tons of dirt for
$5,000. The con artist guarantees the ``aggregate ore'' will yield
at least 20 ounces of gold, an effective price of $250 an ounce vs.
current spot market prices of about $430 an ounce.
   ``The problem is the gold doesn't exist beyond microscopic,
economically unrecoverable levels,'' Meyer said. ``The mine
probably is nothing more than a godforsaken patch of desert
scrubland.''
   The regulators' organization tested the ore in one New Mexico
mine, billed by salesmen as the richest mineral deposit on Earth.
It turned out to have no more gold than is found in sea water,
Meyer said.
   In another case cited by the group, a Wyoming inmate already
jailed on a fraud charge used prison telephones to bilk investors
in Minnesota and Wyoming into paying $6,250 each for worthless dirt
from an inactive Utah mine. When he was caught the second time,
prison authorities moved him to solitary confinement.
   James H. McIlhenny, president of the Council of Better Business
Bureaus, said virtually all of the swindlers operate by telephone.
   ``It's easy to start: just rent a cheap office, install banks of
phones, hire salespeople and start calling from sucker lists. ...
If things get too hot, they simply close up shop, move to another
town ... and start running a new scam,'' he said.
   The two groups offered tips for avoiding a gold swindle:
   _Hang up on high-pressure telephone sales tactics.
   _Beware of vague promises about delayed delivery of gold.
   _Remember that there is no such thing as a ``guaranteed''
investment in gold.
   _Ignore such terms as ``secret,'' ``special'' or
``can't-be-duplicated'' methods for mineral testing.
   _Don't be swayed if a mine is supposedly on federal land. It
costs only a few dollars to establish such a claim.
   _Gold and platinum don't mix, so reject assertions that a mine
has high levels of platinum along with gold or silver.
   _Take time to make your decision and get everything in writing.
   _Official-looking mineral content analyses, known as assays,
mean little. Assayers can be crooked, or they can be duped by a
sample that has been ``salted'' or comes from another mine.
   _Be suspicious of companies insisting on special arrangements
for receipt of investments. Some con artists try to evade mail
fraud penalties by sending a courier to pick up an investment check
or sending a pre-paid envelope from an overnight mail service.
   _Before investing, check out a promoter with your state
securities office or with one of the 174 Better Business Bureaus
around the country.
   ``Why people will commit their life savings over the phone, when
they wouldn't think of buying a car or a house sight-unseen in the
same way, is a continuing and troubling mystery to those of us
whose job it is to promote investor protection,'' Meyer said.
   ``Investors are going to have to learn that when someone offers
to sell them a dollar bill for 60 cents, the correct response is to
just say no,'' he said.

   The stock market rose this morning, further
strengthening gains made last week on a buying surge based on signs
that the economy may be slowing down and easing pressure on
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which ended last week
with a gain of 37.16 points, was up 8.00 to 2,062.59 by 10 a.m.
EDT. The market was closed Monday for Labor Day.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.44 to 150.10. The
American Stock Exchange's market-value index rose 0.60 to 296.22.
   Gaining issues outnumbered declines by more than a 5-to-3 ration
on the NYSE, with 566 up, 332 down and 454 unchanged. Big Board
volume totaled 17.86 million shares after the first half hour of
business.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 52.28 to
2,054.59 for its biggest one-day gain since it rose 74.68 points on
May 31. Much of the advance was attributed to softening interest
rates caused by signs of a slowing economy, notably a rise in the
Labor Department's monthly unemployment figures.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,192 up, 289 down and 427 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 159.84 million shares, up from 144.09
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Societe Generale Names New Board Members After Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian
financier who earlier this year tried to take over Belgium's
largest holding company, was one of 20 new board members elected to
the company's board Tuesday.
   Shareholders of Societe Generale de Belgique SA endorsed the new
board during a special meeting called to set up a new management
structure for the company following its bitter takeover battle
earlier this year.
   In addition to De Benedetti, three of his allies were named to
the board: Peter Cohen, chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of
the United States, Rene Thomas, chairman of Banque Nationale de
Paris, and Alain Minc, the chief of Cerus SA, de Benedetti's French
holding company.
   Societe Generale's Chairman Rene Lamy said he would remain until
the spring shareholders meeting. He will be succeeded by Etienne
Davignon, a former European Economic Community Commissioner, who is
expected to play a major role in the company's restructuring.
   The new board met after the vote to set in motion a major
restructuring of the giant company that has stakes in some 1,300
companies worldwide involved in, among others things, mining,
energy, financial services, chemicals and engineering.
   Analysts have said Societe Generale badly needed to be shaken
up. They said its status as Belgium's largest holding company had
allowed it to retain an antiquated management structure that had
changed little since its founding in 1822.
   The 166-year-old company was the target of a highly public
takeover battle earlier this year between De Benedetti and a
consortium of Belgian and French companies, led by Compagnie
Financiere de Suez. Financiere, a French financial group and the
single largest Societe Generale stockholder, had joined with Groupe
AG, a Belgian insurance group, to oppose De Benedetti's takeover
bid.
   In the end, the two camps struck a compromise power sharing deal
after neither could gain an outright majority stake.
   As part of the deal, de Benedetti was to be named vice chairman
of Societe Generale de Belgique and given control of three other
board seats.
   Shearson had played a major role in De Benedetti's attempt to
take over Societe Generale.
   The 203 shareholders at Tuesday's meeting represented some 40.5
million of Societe Generale's 42.7 million shares. Cohen's Shearson
Lehman became an investor last spring in Europe 1992, a company set
up and controlled by De Benedetti to hold shares in Societe
Generale.
   The new board said 1988 dividend should ``at least'' equal the
1987 payout of 115 Belgian francs per ordinary share ($2.90).
   It said it would raise 1988 dividends on AFV shares, a special
type of share issued under a Belgian tax plan that allows higher
dividends.
   The 1987 payout for Societe Generale AFV stock was 143.65 francs
($3.60) a share, down from 187.55 francs ($4.69) in 1986.
   Societe Generale's net profit fell 22 percent in 1987 to 4.14
billion francs ($103.5 million) from 1986.

   A Nissan Motor official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,

1,000 battery-powered forklifts to the United States, the official
said.
   All of the 180 workers at Barrett Industrial Trucks Inc. will be

   The U.S. company is now owned 20 percent by Nissan Motor, 50
percent by Nissan's wholly owned U.S. Nissan Industrial Equipment

   Crop futures prices opened mostly higher today on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid continuing optimism that exports of
U.S. grain and soybeans are on the rise.
   Wheat futures have been quietly rallying for about two weeks and
opened today near the highs set earlier this summer. The near-month
wheat contract, for September delivery, was above $4 a bushel in
early trading. Near-month wheat reached $4.07 a bushel on July 5.
   Soybean futures were higher in reaction to strong European
markets while corn prices were little changed.
   Although rainfall was in short supply this summer, farmers
increasingly are hoping for dry weather as the corn and soybean
harvests advance, analysts said.
   ``Especially in Iowa and Illinois, where they've got a lot of
weak plants, winds, rains, anything like that probably will knock
those yields down,'' said Steve Freed, grain market analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.03 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1} cents lower with September at $2.90{ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with September at $2.62 a bushel;
soybeans were 5{ cents to 8 cents higher with September at $8.79 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .63 cent lower with October at
71.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .72 cent lower
with September at 81.15 cents a pound; hogs were .87 cent lower to
.60 cent higher with October at 37.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent to 1.80 cents lower with February at 46.85
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures were
lower. The markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.

   The acquisition of American Savings and

the pockets of Bob Bass and his affiliates _ it shows how deep they
are.''
   Bass's personal wealth is estimated at more than $1 billion. The
wealth of the Bass family, including Robert's brothers Sid R., Lee
M. and Edward P., is estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion.
   The family has a history of buying troubled businesses and then
waiting for a turnaround and the profit that follows.
   Their fortune dates back to Texas wildcatter Sid Richardson, who
made a series of successful oil strikes. Richardson never married
and left some of his millions to his partner and nephew, Perry Bass.
   Perry's four sons each inherited $2.8 million, and they combined
assets to form Bass Brothers Enterprises, which built up the family
wealth through shrewd investments. In 1968, Perry, a competitive
sailor, handed over the business to son Sid.
   All educated at Yale University, the Bass brothers have been
described as atypical Texas tycoons with a conservative style and
quiet manner.
   After starting his business career with Wells Fargo Bank, Robert
M. Bass returned to Texas in 1974 to a spot at Bass Brothers
Enterprises.
   Tales of rivalries among the four brothers surfaced in recent
years, and in 1983 Robert broke away and formed Robert M. Bass
Group to pursue deals on his own.
   The savings and loan deal announced Monday is just the latest in
a series for Bass in recent months.
   He bought the Westin Hotel chain from Allegis Corp. for $1.53
billion, then in March sold the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $410
million to developer Donald Trump.
   On May 17, Bass reached an agreement to pay $702 million to
acquire Bell & Howell Co., the publishing and information services
company in Skokie, Ill.
   In a further foray into the publishing field, Bass has been
pursuing a $1.9 billion takeover bid for Macmillan Inc., another
publishing and information company. Macmillan is negotiating a
possible deal with Maxwell Communication Corp. of Britain, which
has made a rival $2.3 billion tender offer.
   Benteman, the analyst, predicts that consistent with past
involvement in acquired companies, the Bass group will not become
heavily involved in managing the newly acquired savings and loan.
   ``He's not a hands-on manager,'' Benteman said. ``He hires the
people to do it, and he gives them the direction.''
   Although this is the first time Bass has acquired a savings and
loan, the move was not unexpected. ``We know they've looked before
at other S&Ls in the Texas area,'' Benteman said.
   ``I think they see a situation where they get a lot of assets
and lot of potential assets at bargain-basement prices,'' he added.
   Aside from their financial coups, Bass and his brothers are
well-known in Fort Worth for civic activities.
   They have provided money for schoolteacher improvement projects,
established a Main Street beautification project, paid for a study
of the needs of a minority neighborhood, renovated buildings,
contributed to hospitals and clinics, financed museums and given to
local high schools and universities.

<TEXT>
   Share prices closed slightly higher Tuesday but
sharply off their peak levels as the market slid in late trading in
the wake of declining New York prices.
   However, volume levels remained low, making it difficult to draw
any firm conclusions about market sentiment, analysts said.
   At the end of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 3.5 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,768.0. The
index opened at 1,766.9 and rose as much as 10.2 points by midday
to its best level of the day.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 5.5 points at
1,426.0. A volume of 326.7 million shares changed hands, compared
with 284.8 million Monday.
   The Financial Times ``500'' share index was 1,003.69, up 3.06
points.
   ``It's difficult to see where the good news is going to come
from, if not from Wall Street,'' said one analyst on London's late
afternoon slide. ``Cash-rich institutions are thinking, `why invest
money now when we're not convinced that good news is on the way.'''
   Other analysts said the U.S. Labor Department report Friday that
U.S. unemployment rose to 5.6 percent in August was seen as a
summer aberration and not indicative of a trend.

<HEAD>Japan To Auction Some Of Its Government Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan liberalized its financial markets Tuesday by
announcing it would sell 40 percent of its 10-year government bonds
by auction and give foreign underwriters a bigger share of the
distribution of the rest of the remaining 60 percent.
   The steps were favorably received by U.S. officials, including
David C. Mulford, the Treasury's assistant secretary for
international affairs, and E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   The auctions will begin in April 1989 and are expected to make
it easier for foreign securities firms, including Americans, to get
a bigger share of the business of selling Japanese government debt.
   Beginning this Oct. 1, the Finance Ministry will increase to
``just under 8 percent'' from 2.5 percent the share held by
foreigner underwriters in the syndicate that distributes bonds that
are not sold by auction.

   The Procter & Gamble Co. said Tuesday it is
forming a joint venture to do business in Venezuela with a
Venezuelan manufacturer of disposable diapers and other infant care
products.
   Procter & Gamble said the joint venture with Industrias Mammi,
C.A., of Caracas, Venezuela, is subject to approval by the
Venezuelan government. P&G, a Cincinnati-based company which makes
and sells food and personal-care products worldwide, declined to
reveal terms of the agreement.
   Mammi makes and markets disposable diapers, other baby care
items and feminine protection products. It employs about 500 people
and owns and operates a manufacturing facility near Caracas.
   Procter & Gamble de Venezuela, C.A., is based in Caracas and has
operated since 1950. It has plants in Caracas and Barquisimeto that
together employ about 1,000 people. P&G's Venezuelan subsidiary
makes and sells detergent, bar soap, toothpaste, dishwashing liquid
and shampoo products.
   Procter & Gamble had worldwide sales of $19.3 billion in fiscal
1987-88. About one-third of that total was overseas sales. The
company sells products in more than 140 countries.

<TEXT>
   3M Co. said it has agreed to buy
Spontex, a French supplier of household and commercial cleaning
products, from Paris-based Chargeurs SA for around 1.1 billion
French francs, or $182 million.
   The cash purchase is expected to be completed in November, 3M
said Tuesday in a prepared statement.
   Spontex manufactures and sells textile, sponge and other
synthetic wiping products used in the household and building
service markets.
   Founded in 1932, Spontex has 1,650 employees in France, Belgium,
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Britain, West Germany, Australia,
Argentina and the United States. Its products are sold in 70 other
countries through distributors.
   Spontex's worldwide sales are around $166 million a year, 3M
said.
   The French company will operate as a separate subsidiary and its
products will continue to be sold under the Spontex brand, said
Marc Adam, group vice president of 3M Consumer Products.
   Alain Limouzineau, chairman and managing director of Spontex,
will continue to head the company's worldwide operations.
   ``This acquisition reflects 3M's commitment to the consumer
market and will enable us to broaden our offerings to consumers
worldwide,'' Adam said. ``We believe we can apply 3M technologies
to Spontex's product lines to produce new generations of products
in the future.''
   3M is a diversified manufacturer serving industrial, commercial
and consumer markets in 51 countries. It has traditionally built
its consumer business mainly through development of new products,
using a number of 3M technologies. 3M had net income of $918
million in 1987 on worldwide sales of $9.4 billion.
   Chargeurs, the parent of Spontex, is a diversified industrial
holding company. Its other subsidiaries are engaged mainly in air
transport, textile manufacturing and communications.

   The stock market strengthened slightly today in
what brokers called post-Labor Day buying interest caused largely
by the big runup of the previous session, but trading remained
light.
   ``All the big boys are back from the beach with lots of cash,
but I think they're still waiting to see what's going on,'' said
Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``This is just a carryover from
Friday's nice rush.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which surged
52.28 points Friday in the biggest one-day gain in three months,
was up another 10.13 to 2,064.72 by 3 p.m. EDT.
   Among broader indicators, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.62 to 150.28. The
American Stock Exchange's market-value index rose 0.56 to 296.18.
   Gaining issues outnumbered declines by about 4-to-3 on the NYSE,
with 790 up, 577 down and 507 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled
103.35 million shares one hour before the closing bell.
   Brokers said stocks attracted some interest because of the rally
Friday, when the government reported rising unemployment in August.
That was interpreted as a sign the economy is slowing down.
   Financial markets tend to respond positively to such news since
it implies eased pressure on interest rates.
   Among the most-active blue-chip issues, IBM fell 1 to 113. There

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed sharply higher at
two-month highs Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on a variety
of signs construed as bullish for export sales. Other grains and
soybeans also gained.
   The Canadian government's estimate that Canada would harvest
15.4 million metric tons of wheat, the smallest crop in 13 years,
helped spur the wheat market, which had been rallying quietly for
about two weeks, analysts said.
   The wheat production estimate issued Friday by Statistics Canada
compares with the U.S. Agriculture Department's latest estimate
that the Canadians would harvest 18 million bushels of wheat this
year. The report prompted concerns that Canada may be forced to
reduce its wheat exports.
   New bids for U.S. wheat from Jordan and Iraq and expectations of
new demand from other countries _ including the Soviet Union _ also
supported wheat futures, said Katharina Zimmer, a grain analyst
with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   ``There is something afoot with the Russians,'' she said.
``Apparently there are some Russian visitors in Washington. We
don't know who they are or what they're doing but the fact is it
was a lot more bullish on the wheat market than the corn market.''
   Wheat futures closed at their highest levels since July 5, when
the year's highs were set.
   At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 10{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.10 a bushel; corn was 3
cents to 5\ cents higher with September at $2.93{ a bushel; oats
were 8 cents to 11{ cents higher with September at $2.71 a bushel;
soybeans were 8{ cents to 17 cents higher with September at $8.89 a

   Wardair Canada will purchase 24 Fokker
100 jet aircraft from the Dutch manufacturer, it was announced
Tuesday.
   Financial details of the deal were not disclosed, Robert Hawk,
spokesman for the Dutch manufacturer's U.S. subsidiary, said.
However, each aircraft sells for between $21 million and $22
million, Hawk said, placing the potential deal at about $500
million.
   Wardair president George D. Curley said the purchase will allow
the company to strengthen its route network and expand medium-haul
flights.
   The aircraft, powered by twin Rolls-Royce engines, seats between
84 and 107 passengers, depending on how the seats are configured,
Hawk said.
   The final eight aircraft in the order may be treated as options,
the Fokker announcement said. Delivery is scheduled to begin in
late 1990.
   The Fokker 100 entered airline service with Swissair in April.
Wardair's purchase brings to 110 the number of Fokker 100s ordered
to date. Several airlines hold options on another 91 aircraft. KLM,
USAir and Braniff also have purchased the aircraft which has an
operating range of 1,750 miles.

   The stock market strengthened slightly today
because of post-Labor Day buying interest in the aftermath of the
big runup during the previous session, although trading remained
slow.
   Brokers said many of the large institutional investors that are
crucial for substantial rallies remained out of the market,
reflecting an underlying caution about committing money to stocks
without more information on the direction of the economy and
interest rates.
   ``A lot of guys are sitting with flat positions, because taking
positions could kill you in this market,'' said Robert O'Toole,
manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
But he said that ``if the institutions come in, this market will
roar on the upside.''
   The market's strong gains on Friday stemmed largely from
increased optimism about stocks and bonds based on evidence that
the economy is slowing down, easing upward pressure on interest
rates. The most potent evidence was a rise in August unemployment
reported by the Labor Department.
   While some stock strategists were disappointed by the market's
weak volume today, others said they were encouraged because prices
didn't retreat on profit-taking, regarded as a sign of increased
confidence.
   ``Despite the fact that volume hasn't accelerated dramatically,
the underlining bias is distinctly positive,'' said Eugene Peroni,
a technical analyst at the Philadelphia investment firm Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. ``Most stocks are behaving well.''

   Entertainer Merv Griffin has extended his
$205 million offer to buy the common stock of Resorts International

   In announcing the extension of the $36-a-share tender offer

   Also extended was Griffco's agreement with New York financier

<HEAD>Pork Futures Plunge On Rising Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures posted steep losses Tuesday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange with frozen pork belly prices plunging their
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound on indications of a sharp
increase in hog supplies.
   On other markets, energy futures fell dramatically; grains and
soybeans were higher; precious metals were lower; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   The weakness in pork was rooted in the cash hog markets, where
larger-than-expected supplies of market-ready hogs pushed prices
down $1.50 to $2 per hundredweight, said Tom O'Hare, livestock
market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``It was just a matter of too many available for what demand was
coming,'' he said.
   Kills also were higher than expected with an estimated 321,000
hogs slaughtered Tuesday compared with 307,000 on the same date a
year ago.
   An unusually large spring pig crop will ensure against supply
problems this fall, and the amount of pork bellies and other pork
products in cold storage remains at near-record levels.
   The bearish sentiment spread to the adjacent cattle pits, where
selling led to a modest deflation of cattle futures prices, O'Hare
said.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent to 1.03 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in October at 70.97 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .62 cent lower with September at 81.07
cents a pound; hogs were 1.27 cents lower to .60 cent higher with
October at 37.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.77 cents
to 2 cents lower with February at 1.98 cents a bushel.
   Crude-oil futures plunged to their lowest levels since October
1986 on signs of continuing discord within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.
   ``There had been hope that the Iran-Iraq peace process would
have ushered in a new period of OPEC cooperation. Instead it
appears that OPEC has dissolved and it looks like we're on the
brink of a price war,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Reports that one OPEC member, the United Arab Emirates, was
openly flaunting OPEC crude-oil production quotas ``makes a
complete mockery'' of the cartel's price-support efforts, Beutel
said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 36 cents to 55 cents
lower with October at $14.24 a barrel; heating oil was 1.17 cents
to 1.39 cents lower with October at 41.71 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.05 cents to 1.45 cents lower with October at 42.53
cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade settled at
their highest levels since July 5 _ when the year's highs were set
_ on a variety of signs construed as bullish for export sales.
Other grains and soybeans also gained.
   A Canadian government estimate that Canada would harvest 15.4
million metric tons of wheat, the smallest crop in 13 years, helped
spur the wheat market, which had been rallying quietly for about
two weeks, analysts said.
   The report Friday from Statistics Canada prompted concerns that

   New bids from Jordan and Iraq for U.S. wheat and expectations of
new demand from other countries _ including the Soviet Union _ also
supported wheat futures, said Katharina Zimmer, a grain analyst
with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   The USDA announced aftr the close that private exporters had
sold 550,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union for the
1988-89 marketing year and that another 252,400 metric tons of corn
had been switched to the Soviet Union from other destinations.
   Wheat settled 6 cents to 10 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 5
cents higher with September at $2.93{ a bushel; oats were 8 cents
to 11{ cents higher with September at $2.71 a bushel; soybeans were
8{ cents to 17\ cents higher with September at $8.88 a bushel.
   The inflation-sensitive precious metals futures declined
modestly on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting the opposing
tugs of lower oil prices, which was bearish, and higher grain
prices and a weaker dollar, which were bullish, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $2.70 lower with October at $429.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.8 cents lower with September at
$6.485 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 266.40.

   The stock market advanced Tuesday because of
increased buying interest from a pre-Labor Day surge, but the
trading level remained slow and signaled cautious behavior by large
influential investors.
   ``I don't see any brand new money rushing in,'' said Robert
O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York. ``All the big boys are back from the beach
with lots of cash, but I think they're still waiting to see what's
going on.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which jumped
52.28 points Friday for the biggest one-day advance in three
months, added another 10.67 to close at 2,065.26. Broader market
indicators also rose.
   But New York Stock Exchange volume totaled only 122.25 million
shares, considerably less than the 159.84 million traded in the
Friday session, when the Labor Department's report that
unemployment rose in August incited some enthusiasm in the markets
because it eased fear of inflation.
   The weaker volume Tuesday disheartened some strategists who had
been hoping for a more substantial boost in buying interest by
large institutional investors following the three-day Labor Day
break.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Gordon Smith, head of institutional
trading at the Baltimore firm of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. On the
other hand, he said, ``People coming back from vacation aren't
going to spend the first day buying and selling stocks. It doesn't
surprise me, the volume as light as it is.''
   Others said they were encouraged because the market didn't
retreat on profit-taking, historically a sign of anxiety about the
short-term direction of stocks.
   ``Despite the fact volume hasn't accelerated dramatically, the
underlining bias is distinctly positive,'' said Eugene Peroni,
technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
``Most stocks are behaving well.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 808 up, 626 down and
505 unchanged.
   Among the most prominent issues, IBM slumped 1[ to 112~ on
reports that a group of smaller computer makers planned to
introduce a rival to the Personal System-2. IBM's decline helped
drag down some other big-name technology stocks, notably Digital,
which fell 2 to 92{, and Compaq, down 1{ to 52|.
   A plunge in oil prices depressed petroleum stocks although it
helped transportation issues. Chevron fell | to 44{, Schlumberger
fell { to 32{ and Occidental fell ] to 25~. AMR rose 1| to 44~,
Delta rose ~ to 47} and UAL rose 1] to 91.
   Waste Management gained 1\ to 38~. The Wall Street Journal's
``Heard on the Street'' column Tuesday said the company could
benefit from tightened state regulations on trash disposal.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 147.26 million shares.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, rose $8.58 billion.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 0.54 to 150.20
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.27 to 304.62, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.11 to 265.59.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.97
to 296.56. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 377.33, up 0.82.

   The dollar declined against most major
currencies Tuesday pushed down by a wave of selling after the U.S.
currency market reopened following the Labor Day weekend.
   Gold prices also fell after a mixed performance overseas.
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $426.60 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $429 late Friday.
   Currency brokers said activity in the foreign-exchange market
slowed with the dollar trading in a narrow range following Friday's
selloff in advance of the holiday weekend. Friday's activity was
sparked by a higher-than-expected unemployment figure that showed
the U.S. economy may be weakening.
   The Labor Department reported unemployment rose 5.6 percent in
August, from 5.4 percent in July.
   Friday's selloff was followed by a further weakening of the
dollar in foreign markets Monday, while U.S. currency markets were
closed.
   Analysts said after last week's activity, investors were turning
their attention to this week's report on the Producer Price Index,
an important measure of inflation, and next Wednesday's U.S. trade
deficit figures.
   ``The dollar market will be a side market until then,'' said
Jack Barbanel, first vice president with Gruntal & Co. Inc. in New
York.
   Traders said the markets are likely to remain cautious in
advance of the fresh data.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell 0.43 yen
to a closing 135.60 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 135.68
yen. At the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar was down
0.85 yen at 134.925 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7035 to buy one pound, almost two cents more than $1.6860 late
Monday. Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.70365, compared
with $1.6850 late Friday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Friday included: 1.84015 West German marks, down from 1.8524;
1.5530 Swiss francs, down from 1.5567; 1.23405 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2355; 6.2695 French francs, down from 6.2915; 1,378.00
Italian lire, down from 1,381.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.8425 West German marks, down from 1.8555; 1.5525 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5625; 6.2715 French francs, down from 6.3124; 2.0820
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0957; 1,377.65 Italian lire, down from
1,380.50; 1.2340 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2338.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $428.10 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $427.50 per ounce. In Zurich, gold
closed at a bid $428.00 an ounce compared with $427.50 late Monday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 23 cents to close at a bid $429.15
an ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed at $426.70 a
troy ounce compared with $429.30 late Friday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.56 a troy ounce, compared
with Monday's $6.50.
   On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery fell to
$6.485 per troy ounce, compared with Friday's $6.518.

<HEAD>Rivals To Launch Alternative To IBM's New PC Line, Analysts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   IBM's top rivals in personal computers have
called a news conference for next Tuesday at which they are
expected to announce an alternative design for the way information
flows inside a personal computer.
   The new design would make it possible for the companies to build
personal computers that rival IBM's 1{-year-old Personal System-2
line without departing so far from the older standard, analysts
said Tuesday.
   Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston is leading the challenge, which
may eventually include as many as 30 companies that make personal
computers or related products, said Jim Weil, an analyst for
Gartner Securities Corp.
   Calling the news conference for Tuesday in New York are Compaq,
Japanese-owned Epson America and NEC Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
NEC Corp., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti, Tandy Corp., Wyse Technology
and Zenith Data Systems.
   The joint project could put additional competitive pressure on
IBM, but it might also help IBM by serving as an acknowledgement
that its new Personal System-2 line has features that are worth
duplicating, Weil said.
   IBM could benefit if the delay in bringing the new computers to
market gives IBM a chance to get its line better established, said
George Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass.
   Colony said he thought creating a new standard was a bad idea
because, ``There would be further confusion on the part of the
users, and that would translate into slower sales.''
   The new standard is for a ``bus,'' something which controls the
way information flows through a computer. The more advanced models
of IBM's Personal System-2 line use a new bus called Micro Channel.
IBM's rivals use the older bus that was used in IBM's PC AT.
   Weil said IBM's rivals will claim that their new bus offers all
the power of IBM's Micro Channel but allows people to continue
using their older add-on equipment, such as circuit cards. IBM's
Micro Channel requires users to buy all new add-on equipment.
   Compaq declined comment on the reports. Weil said that in
addition to the companies calling the news conference, Intel Corp.
and Microsoft Corp. have played a role in developing the new
standard.
   The story was broken by PC Week, a trade newspaper, in this
week's editions.

<HEAD>Cocoa Consumers Ask Producers To Pay Debts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nations that consume cocoa appealed Tuesday to
countries that produce it to pay their debts to the International
Cocoa Organization's fund to stabilize falling world prices.
   The organization, composed of 37 cocoa consuming and producing
nations, faces a shortfall in covering operating costs in the cocoa
year that runs from October 1988 to September 1989, said delegates
to the cartel's two-week conference, which opened Monday.
   Cocoa-producing nations owe almost $70 million to the group's
price-stabilization fund. The biggest debtor is the Ivory Coast,
which owes $48 million. Brazil owes $9 million. Other debtors
include Cameroon, Ghana and Nigeria.
   Brazil on Tuesday paid a separate $146,700 it owed to the
group's administrative fund, said its chief delegate Lindenberg
Sette.
   The shortfall in the price-stabilization fund would also leave
the organization unable to finance a proposed new stockpiling
scheme aimed at supporting prices, now at their lowest for seven
years.
   Operating costs for 1988-89 are estimated at $23 million. The
organization estimates it will have only $10 million to $12 million
on hand when the new cocoa year starts Oct. 1.
   The organization may sell cocoa from its current stockpile of
250,000 metric tons to meet the budget shortfall. The
organization's secretariat has drawn up plans to sell 10,000 tons
in 1989 and 15,000 in 1989-90.

<HEAD>Car and Truck Sales Fall 10.7 Percent, Incentives Why</HEAD>

   Car and truck sales fell 10.7 percent in August,
compared with the same month last year when incentives called for
quicker buying decisions by consumers, the automakers and analysts
said Tuesday.
   Foreign and domestic vehicle makers, except Japan's Toyota Motor
Sales USA Inc. and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co., said they sold
1.25 million cars and trucks last month, compared with 1.35 million
during the same month last year.
   For the 10-day period ending Aug. 31, Chrysler Corp. said its
sales of U.S.-made cars inched up 2.6 percent compared with the
same period last year. Ford Motor Co., meantime, said its car sales
for the period fell 1.4 percent and General Motors Corp. reported a
13.9 percent drop.
   Each of the Big Three reported increases in car sales so far
this calendar year.
   Toyota spokesman Edd Snyder said a dealer incentive program that
stretched through the Labor Day weekend delayed computation of the
company's monthly figures. Hyundai's Ted Kade said Tuesday that
figures for the month hadn't been calculated.
   Both automakers said their sales figures would be announced
Wednesday.
   ``The kinds of incentives that are on this year are normal
run-of-the-mill incentives that have been on the cars for a long
time,'' said auto analyst Donald DeScenza of Nomura Securities Inc.
of New York City.
   ``There's no incentive to buy now to take advantage of current
incentives,'' he said.
   A year ago, car makers offered attractive incentives, including
cut-rate financing as low as 1.9 percent for GM vehicles, to lure
customers into showrooms and shrink inventories with just one month
left in the model year.
   Those incentives frequently involved short-term offers such as
low financing and cash-back deals. This year the incentives are
different.
   ``The incentives are sustainable kinds of things,'' DeScenza
said. ``Incentives have a big impact when it's clear to the car
buyer that they are not going to be around very long.
   ``Everybody knew (last year) they were temporary,'' he added,
``that they wouldn't last forever. Everybody knew that the models
that qualified for them were in limited supply and dwindling
rapidly.''
   Tom O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive Resources Inc.
of Wayne, Pa., agreed, saying last year's incentives colored the
sales figures this year.
   ``Certainly we're going to be down (in sales) from last year,''
he said. ``These are certainly very strong sales.''
   GM and Ford showed declines in late-August and monthly sales
while Chrysler showed increases during the two periods. There were
nine selling days in both late-August periods and 27 sales days in
August of this year, compared with 26 in August of 1987.
   For the Aug. 21-31 period this year, Chrysler said it sold
32,214 cars made in the United States, 2.6 percent higher than the
31,388 it sold during the same period last year. Ford sold 65,600
U.S.-made cars during the period, a 1.4 percent decrease from the
66,515 cars it sold during the same time last year.
   GM's late-August sales fell from 126,629 last year to 108,986
this year, a drop of 13.9 percent.
   For the month, the No. 1 automaker sold 284,056 cars, off 20.7
percent from 345,098 in August 1987. Ford's monthly sales dropped
6.2 percent from 182,824 in August 1987 to 178,023 last month.
   Chrysler showed the only monthly gain among the Big Three,
rising from 75,156 U.S.-made cars in August of last year to 82,366
cars last month _ a 5.5 percent increase.
   ``Chrysler has been more aggressive than the other two in using
incentives to stimulate sales ...'' DeScenza said. ``There's an
implication that they're buying the sales (with incentives).''

<HEAD>Setback For Pernod In Fight For Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar merger battle over the
whiskey giant, Irish Distillers Group PLC, was in the balance
Tuesday night after a watchdog body for London's City financial
district rejected an appeal by European bidders.
   The British Panel on Takeovers and Mergers threw out an appeal
by France's Pernod Ricard SA against a panel decision allowing
British rival hotel and leisure group, Grand Metropolitan PLC, to
sweeten its hostile bid by launching a ``knockout'' bid offer.
   The fight is three-cornered as British brewers, Watney Mann and
Truman Holdings, are also seeking to control the Irish company.
   On Wednesday, the legal battle shifts to Dublin, where Pernod is
trying to stop a key shareholder selling its stake to Grand Met.
   After days of suspense, Pernod formally made a 244 million
pounds sterling ($415 million) bid for Irish Distillers on Monday,
but Grand Met raised its original 180 million pounds ($306 million)
offer to 284 million pounds ($483 million).
   The Grand Met offer amounts to 525 Irish pence a share from an
earlier 400 Irish pence a share. The Pernod bid is worth only 450
Irish pence a share.
   On Sunday, the executive of the takeover panel ruled that was
acceptable for Grand Met because it gave shareholders the
opportunity to decide the best offer. This was despite an earlier
pledge from Grand Met not to change its offer in the absence of a
rival bid.
   The full panel on Tuesday ended a day of deliberation by backing
the executive's decision and rejecting the Pernod appeal.
   Meanwhile, Pernod had said it would not be prepared to act as a
``white knight'' to save Irish Distillers from Grand Met. unless it
was pledged the support of 50 percent of Irish Distillers shares.
   At the weekend it believed it had this support, holding pledges
that included one from fruit and vegetable group FII Fyffes PLC, a
Dublin fruit and vegetable merchant, which holds 20 percent of
Irish Distillers.
   But fears that Fyffes was about to change its mind and go for
the higher English offer led Pernod to seek a temporary injunction
from the Dublin High Court preventing Fyffes from selling to Grand
Met.
   A full hearing of the case will take place Wednesday. Pernod
says it admits the Fyffes promise was not in writing, but believes
it to be legally enforceable.
   Irish Distillers products include Irish whiskey brands Jamesons,
Powers, Paddy and Tullamore.

<HEAD>Litton Executive Loses Appeal on Fraud Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Tuesday rejected the appeal by a former vice president of Litton
Industries Inc. who was convicted of racketeering in a $6.3 million
defense scheme.
   Roland E. Fisher, 58, of Drexel Hill faces a sentence of three
years in prison and a $10,000 fine for his participation in one of
the largest defense fraud cases ever prosecuted by the government.
   He was convicted last December of mail fraud, racketeering,
obstruction of federal agency proceedings and making false
statements to a federal agency.
   Fisher argued in appeal that the evidence against him was
insufficient and some testimony was prejudicial. He also argued
that he had participated unknowingly in the frauds.
   However, the appeals court ruled that prosecutors provided ample
evidence to convict him.
   Fisher's attorney, Daniel F. Ryan III, did not return a call for
comment.
   Fisher is free on $50,000 bail. Assistant District Attorney
Nicholas C. Harbist said he plans to file a motion soon asking the
U.S. District Court to order Fisher to report to prison.
   In 1986, Litton pleaded guilty to more than 300 counts of
submitting false claims to the government and 20 counts of mail
fraud. Litton agreed to pay $15 million in fines and resitution.
   Two other officials, former purchasing manager Joseph DiLiberto
and Michael Millspaugh, a former Litton controller, have pleaded
guilty in the case.
   The men and the company were accused of overcharging the
government $6.3 million by inflating costs on contracts for
military electronics.
