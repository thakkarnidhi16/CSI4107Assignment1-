<HEAD>Final Action on Tax Bill Delayed as Senate Deals With Unrelated

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday beat back a series of
unrelated amendments to a catchall tax bill, including one designed
to benefit 2 million owners of home satellite dishes.
   But consideration of such proposals delayed until next week
final action on the tax bill, which includes a ``bill of rights''
for taxpayers involved in disputes with the Internal Revenue
Service, and special relief worth $2.7 billion over three years for
various groups, including farmers, artists and first-time
homebuyers.
   By nightfall, an angry majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., counted more than 100 proposed amendments still awaiting
action and coaxed the Senate into cutting off any more.
   ``This list is crazy, nuts and getting crazier all the time,''
Byrd said. ``We ought to settle down and get our senses.''
   Within two hours, Byrd announced senators had agreed to drop all
but 29.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas sided with Byrd, noting
amendments dealing with everything but taxes, including sanctions
against Iraq, aid to the Nicaragua rebels and a move to halt
commercial development of the historic Manassas battlefield in
Virginia.
   ``This is the typical tax bill,'' Dole said. ``Everybody cleans
out their desks and their trash cans and says `we'll put it on the
tax bill.' We've reached the point that if somebody doesn't take
the bull by the horns, we'll never finish.''
   On the Manassas battlefield issue, the Senate voted 50-25 to
approve an amendment by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., requiring the
federal government to seize 540 acres of land to prevent further
development on the site about 30 miles west of Washington. The
House has approved the same provision, but the interior secretary
has said he will recommend that President Reagan veto it.
   In siding with Bumpers, the Senate defeated a plan by Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., to authorize the taking of only 80 acres and allow
development of housing on adjacent areas.
   The tax bill's main purpose is to correct errors in the big tax
overhaul enacted in 1986. But since this is the only tax bill with
a chance of becoming law this year, senators view it as the last
opportunity to have their pet amendments considered.
   But there is no assurance it will become law. The version
approved by the House is considerably different and there is some
doubt that the House and Senate can negotiate a compromise before
quitting next week.
   In a long day of debate over the bill, the Senate considered and
rejected amendments calling for:
   _An end to what Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., called
discrimination against owners of home satellite dishes by
television programmers. His amendment was aimed at helping the 2
million dish owners, most of them living in rural areas, whose
television and satellite dish have become prime sources of contact
with the outside world.
   Gore's amendment would have required that programs provided to
cable systems be made available to dish owners, and ordered the
Federal Communications Commission to extend network programming
into isolated areas that cannot receive broadcast signals.
   Opponents, led by Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the
amendment was unnecessary, that ``there are no unfair trade
practices in pricing and distribution of satellite programming.''
Managers of the bill said Gore's amendment had no chances of
becoming law as part of the tax legislation.
   _An 18-month study of whether government workers should get
equal pay for jobs of comparable worth. Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash.,
proposed the study and was opposed vigorously by conservatives, who
said it would lead to new federal requirements for what any worker
could be paid. Evans called the dissent ``blind opposition to
knowledge.''
   _A symbolic endorsement of the right of the District of Columbia
to finance abortions for poor women.
   _Raising from $17 a month to $38 the maximum tax-free
mass-transit benefits that an employer could furnish workers. Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., offered the amendment in the name of
fairness, saying the government already provides a much higher
subsidy for corporate executives to park their limousines. He would
have paid for the change by doubling, to a maximum of $7,700, the
tax imposed on gas-guzzling cars _ most of them luxury imports.

<HEAD>Armani Show Reconfirms Position As Milan Fashion Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giorgio Armani has done it again.
   No matter how much you steel yourself against the charm of the
designer and his staff, or shut your eyes to the sumptuous
surroundings of his dowtown Milan palazzo, and blot out the beauty
of past collections _ it is to no avail. The clothes speak for
themselves and confirm that Giorgio Armani is the leader of the
Milan runway.
   ``Ravishing,'' exclaimed Kal Ruttenstein, fashion director at
Bloomingdale's, after Wednesday night's show which took the fashion
crowd by surprise with evening wear that excelled the daytime
clothes, usually the Armani forte.
   ``Breathtaking'' sighed Elin Saltzman of Saks Fifth Avenue, as
she kissed a satisfied Armani backstage.
   But a comment by Janie Samet, fashion editor of the French daily
Le Figaro, was worth a thousand adjectives. ``Il est le seul.'' (He
is the only one), she pronounced, implying that only he in the
school of Italian ready to wear could pose a threat to French
fashion.
   Usually Armani is a step ahead of the pack, showing the
direction fashion will take the following season. He was the first
to present androgynous women and one of the earliest to send short
skirts and lingerie tops down the runway.
   This season he preferred to flow with the tide, presenting a
quiet, calm Spring-Summer 1989 collection, with delicate ethnic
touches and a romantic maiden air, inspired by the avant-garde
minimal designer Romeo Gigli.
   It is the softness of the fabrics more than the cut of the
clothes that give the collection its ethereal mood. Even Armani's
daytime suits with his new jacket rounded at the shoulder and hem
and curved gently at the waist, worn over a long slim skirt, or
wide pants, are stitched in such airy tweeds they could float down
the runway all on their own.
   The blouse, always a strong point at Armani, becomes so light
that at times it looks like a chiffon scarf tied around the midrift.
   Fabrics are either checked or striped or printed in floral and
geometric patterns. His evening wear is adorned in exquisite gold
and silver embroidery and beading, reminiscent of Indian fabrics.
   To emphasize the softness of his collection, Armani takes the
edge out of the hemline, leaving it unevenly stitched and
un-ironed, as if it had been tucked up in a hurry. This
do-it-yourself look spells grim days ahead for seamstresses and
private maids.
   As the day goes on fabrics get lighter and sheerer. A series of
cocktail suits were in Liberty and China porcelain prints with
matching stockings. Then came the negligee gowns, or elongated
slips in simple navy satin, worn over a chiffon, fringed shawl.
   Embroidery started out slowly as piping on an otherwise simple
gown or Tuxedo suit, to cover increasingly large areas of cloth
until it became the entire dress.
   Thus a youthful strapless gown was made up entirely of chiffon
flowers bunched together to look like an Old English porcelain
bouquet, and long skirts, pants and even shorts with matching tops
were lavished with gold and silver threading and beaded
craftsmanship. The latter was a throw-back to the ornate Indian
embroidery popular in the 1960's as confirmed by the Indian evening
bags which completed the look.
   When they were not dazzling with jewels, his evening gowns were
Ophelia -like in wispy chiffon, with a criss-cross bodice, and long
skirt, with a dainty underskirt peering through.
   Chiffon, in ombre pastel shades and creamy pinks was also used
for pants and skirts alike to go with richly embroidered evening
jackets.
   To make sure the look remained innocent, Armani, the
perfectionist, showed the flatest heels of the week. More slippers
than shoes, closed in the front, but strapped at the back, they
usually were made out of fabric.
   Armani who tried the boudoir look several years ago, but didn't
seem to like it, shied away from the bare-breasted nude look which
has been the shock item on the runway this week _ except for a
single black chiffon gown in which white embroidered piping served
a double purpose: it concealed bare breasts, while at the same time
it framed a bare midrift right down to the navel.
   The Armani price tag for the Spring-Summer 1989 is not
outrageous, just expensive. A jeweled jacket costs approximately
$3,000 to $3,500 depending on how elaborate is the embroidery,
while an entirely embroidered outfit can run as high as $7,OOO. The
dilemma is do you buy a new car, or do you dress Armani and walk.

   A sightseeing plane with 46 aboard crashed into a
hotel and exploded shortly after takeoff from a northern Chinese
city Friday, killing all but four on board, an official daily said
Saturday.
   The China Youth News said the four others on the Soviet-built
Ilyushin Il-14 were injured, and some workers in the hotel also
sustained injuries in the accident in Linfen, Shanxi province,
about 400 miles southwest of Beijing.
   It said the passengers on the piston-engine light transport
plane were all employees of a local knitting factory. They had paid
$4.30 each for a 15-minute air tour of the region.
   The daily said the plane went down one minute after takeoff,
crashing into the roof of the Xinqiao Hotel. Four passengers
managed to escape seconds before the plane exploded. The four
crewmembers were all killed.
   The sightseeing service, operated by a local air company, had
just begun on Oct. 1, China's National Day.
   Wang Shichang, director of the knitting factory and one of the
four on board who escaped, said his group had seen a television
report on the sightseeing flight and decided to take it ``as we
have earned a lot of money recently. We never imagined we would
have this disaster.''
   It was the second major plane accident of the year in China,
following the crash of a Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-18 four-engine
turboprop operated by the national airways CAAC in January that
killed 108 near the southwest China city of Chungking.
   In August another CAAC jetliner skidded off the runway at Hong
Kong airport and plunged into the harbor, killing six crew members
and one passenger.

   It's been 31 years since ``Dem Bums'' became
beach bums, since Walter O'Malley moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los
Angeles.
   The wounds have yet to heal.
   Today, the Dodgers return _ to Shea Stadium, not Ebbets Field _
to play the New York Mets for the National League pennant. But to
many Brooklynites, this homecoming to the borough of Queens will be
happy only if the Dodgers go down in defeat.
   ``The old Brooklyn Dodgers were a very special team, in a very
special time, in a very special place. The Los Angeles Dodgers are
not really the Dodgers,'' said Brooklynite Frances Macrillo.
   ``They don't look like the Dodgers, they don't sound like the
Dodgers,'' she continued. ``It's very easy to root for the Mets.''
   Ms. Macrillo's cheers are echoed by the many Brooklyn fans who
swore off the Dodgers on Oct. 23, 1957, when O'Malley moved the
team of Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider closer to
Catalina than Coney Island.
   Boxing publicist Irving Rudd describes ``Dodgeritis'' as a
borough-wide lethargy brought on by the shift; state Sen. Thomas
Bartosiewicz spent years trying to get support for an ``Ebbets
Dome'' and a new team; New York Post columnist Pete Hamill writes
of his vow to ``never forgive, never forget'' the late O'Malley.
   ``They abandoned us, they left us. I feel no compunction to root
for the Dodgers,'' said Marty Adler, founder of the Brooklyn
Dodgers Hall of Fame. ``When they left us, I was angry. ... When
they left, they took the soul. The soul left Brooklyn.''
   Ebbets Field, home of Brooklyn's beloved Bums, was razed in
1960. As far as many younger fans know, the Dodgers have always
played in California's Chavez Ravine.
   ``I think a lot of this is passe now and over with,'' said New
York Knicks public relations man Dennis D'Agostino, a die-hard Mets
fan who wrote a book about the team's history. ``I don't read as
much into this as other people do.
   ``If you were 15 when the Dodgers left, you're 46 now. What do
you remember about the Dodgers? They've been gone 31 years. The
Mets have been playing for 26 years.''
   Try telling that to Hamill, who welcomed the Dodgers to the
playoffs with a vitriolic column in which O'Malley's name was
preceded each time with an epithet.
   ``Some wounds never heal,'' wrote Hamill, who broke a
three-decade boycott of Dodgers home games this week to root for
the Mets (who, by the way, have eight native Californians on the
roster).
   ``I go to the enemy camp'' _ Dodgers Stadium, that is _ ``as a
hostile witness,'' he wrote. ``And the vow still holds. Never
forgive. Never, ever forget.''

   A tiger escaped from its cage, attacked a boy and
triggered a panic that left 40 people unconscious during a circus
in rural china, a newspaper reported today.
   The Workers Daily reported that the tiger broke out of its cage
after being hit by its trainer for failing to carry out a trick
during a show in northern China's Shanxi province last month.
   It said 40 people were knocked unconscious when hundreds of
spectators surged toward the exit. One primary school student was
attacked by the tiger and required 48 stitches in his face.
   The daily did not say how the tiger was subdued and returned to
its cage. It said a similar accident involving the same circus
troupe had occurred the previous month and called for improved
safety measures.

   Three pesticide-laden helicopters took off on
an aerial spraying mission Thursday night to fight the Medfly
infestation that has set up a base in Beverly Hills and the city's
toney West Side.
   ``They're currently over Beverly Hills,'' said Tom Kenney, a
Federal Aviation Administration controller at Santa Monica Airport
where the choppers departed from shortly after 8 p.m.
   The spraying program is the first step in an all-out attack
against the Mediterranean fruit fly, a pest that destroys about 250
varieties of produce.
   The National Weather Service again forecast coastal fog for the
area Thursday night, but officials moved the starting time up 2{
hours to 8 p.m. hoping to beat the rolling fog bank.
   The spraying was ordered because 47 Medflies were found in yards
since Sept. 26, a serious infestation that if allowed to spread
would threaten fruits and vegetables that are a major part of
California's $15.5 billion-a-year farm economy.
   The Thursday flight was set for a 35-square-mile area of 100,000
residents that includes middle-class stucco homes, mansions, swank
Rodeo Drive shops and luxury car dealerships, all subject to the
honey-like stickiness of the Malathion spray.
   Along with parts of Beverly Hills, officials are spraying
sections of western Los Angeles and the adjacent cities of Culver
City and West Hollywood.
   At Martin Cadillac on the corner of Olympic Boulevard and Bundy
Drive in West Los Angeles, a caravan of about 100 shiny Caddies
left the sales lot Wednesday night for an underground parking lot
at a bank building six blocks away, sales manager Steve Mitchell
said Thursday.
   He said several of the cars were returned to the sales lot
Thursday morning for potential tire-kickers, with the luxury car
exodus to be repeated at nightfall.
   The pesticide poses no health risks, health officials say, but
the sticky corn syrup bait mixed with the Malathion could mess up a
car's paint job. Museums in the area covered their outdoor statues.
   Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said the fight to save the
state's farm industry knows no economic boundaries.
   ``We're encouraging people to cover up their Rolls Royces just
like they would cover up their Pintos,'' he said on Wednesday

<TEXT>
   Mark Twain once said there were three types of
lies: lies, damned lies and statistics. Republicans and Democrats
are arguing about all three in the aftermath of the Dan
Quayle-Lloyd Bentsen debate.
   Each side accused the other vice presidential hopeful of playing
fast and loose with the facts in Wednesday night's encounter.
   A Republican truth squad put out a six-page analysis of
``Bentsen Distortions and Errors'' on Thursday, while Democrats
confined themselves to five pages on ``Dan Quayle's Factual
Mistakes.''
   In less polite parlance, that means lies on such subjects as
Social Security, poverty and just how well Quayle knows European
leaders.
   Here is a look at some of the points in dispute:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle said, ``Poverty hasn't gone up in this administration. It
hasn't gone down much either.'' The Census Bureau says that in
1980, 13 percent of the U.S. population, or 29.3 million people,
were living in poverty. The rate rose to 14 percent, or 31.8
million people, in 1981, Reagan's first year in office, peaked at
15.2 percent or 35.3 million in 1983, then gradually dropped back
to 13.5 percent, or 32.5 million, in 1987, the latest year
available.
   Measured since 1980, the poverty rate is up by one-half
percentage point; measured since 1981, it is down by that much. In
either case the actual number of poor people is up, since the
population has grown.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   When Bentsen charged that Quayle ``voted eight times to cut the
benefits on Social Security,'' the Republican fired back, ``You
know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight
times. What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted for
is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.'' He said Bentsen, too,
had twice voted for freezes, and that Michael Dukakis took a
similar position at a governors' conference.
   Mark Gearan, a Dukakis spokesman, did not dispute those votes,
but said Quayle ``doesn't understand that freezing or delaying the
COLA cuts benefits. ... The bottom line is smaller checks.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PACS and HONORARIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen, asked about being the Senate's biggest recipient of
political action committee money _ $1.5 million for his Senate
re-election campaign, said, ``I don't find it embarrassing at
all.'' He said his $10,000-a-place ``breakfast club'' for lobbyists
was ``a real doozy'' of a mistake, but ``perfectly legal, and you
have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill.''
   But Bentsen's $10,000-a-seat club was considered unusual,
although other congressional leaders do arrange regular briefings
and entrees for favored donors.
   Bentsen, who accepts no speaking fees, charged that Quayle has
``collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now,
speaking to various interest groups.''
   Quayle's camp said he donated almost $20,000 of his honoraria to
charity in 1986 and $14,302 in 1987. Senate rules prohibit senators
from keeping speech fees above 30 percent of their salary.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle apparently mixed up his CFCs and CO2 when he praised
Reagan administration efforts to grapple with the ozone problem.
``For the first time, we are talking about the impact of C02 to the
ozone layer,'' he said.
   But CO2 _ carbon dioxide _ does not deplete the ozone layer;
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, do. Carbon dioxide does add to the
global warming phenomenon known as the ``greenhouse effect'' _
another environmental problem.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BOSTON HARBOR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After Quayle said Dukakis did ``virtually nothing'' to clean up
Boston Harbor, ``the dirtiest waterway in America,'' Bentsen
charged that a Reagan veto of a clean water bill had ``made it
impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor.''
   But Dukakis dragged his feet on the cleanup back in 1978, the
final year of his first term as governor, when he prepared an
application to the Environmental Protection Agency seeking a waiver
from the 1972 Clean Water Act requiring secondary treatment of
sewage being pumped into the harbor.
   His successor completed the application in 1979. By the time the
EPA rejected it in May 1983, Dukakis was governor again. Under
court pressure, Dukakis and the state legislature created a public
authority to undertake the $6 billion cleanup _ without the 75
percent federal funding available in the 1970s.

<HEAD>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle said, ``I've been to Geneva many times to meet with our
negotiators as we are hammering out the INF treaty. I've met with
the Western political leaders _ Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor Kohl.
I know them. They know me.''
   According to a visitor's log kept by U.S. officials in Geneva,
Quayle made only one visit to the Swiss city during the nearly four
years the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty was under
negotiation. That was in February 1987.
   He also visited Geneva last Feb. 7-8 and met again with U.S.
arms control negotiators, but that was two months after the treaty
was signed.
   Jeff Nesbitt, a Quayle spokesman, said he believed the senator
met Helmut Kohl when the West German chancellor stopped by a dinner
Quayle had with Kohl's chief of staff at a conference of NATO
leaders in Munich a year or so ago.
   Nesbitt said he knew of at least one meeting with Thatcher: Last
July when the British prime minister attended a dinner with
senators on a visit to Washington.

<HEAD>House Votes Cabinet Status for VA; Supporters Say Changes Will Be
Minor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elevating the Veterans Administration to full
Cabinet status will involve only changing a few signs outside the
building, proponents said after the House voted overwhelming
support of the change.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., said the cost of the change
approved Thursday by the House will come to less than $1 million in
1989 and will give the nation's 27 million veterans direct access
to the White House.
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that converting
the VA into a Cabinet department would cost $33 million over five
years.
   The House vote sent the compromise bill, making the VA the
government's 14th Cabinet department, to the Senate, which was
expected to add its approval. President Reagan backs the move, and
it was his public announcement of support last summer that gave
impetus to the legislation.
   House approval came on a voice vote, overriding objections from
opponents who called the move an act of election-year pandering
that will result in increased future costs for veterans programs.
   ``This is an act of great hypocrisy,'' said Rep. John Porter,
R-Ill., who said he had heard numerous colleagues complain
privately that the legislation should not be adopted.
   ``Why does Congress do things like that? We do it because of
special interests,'' Porter said. ``Members are in craven fear of
retribution at the polls. I think the American people are looking
to have people of courage to govern them. You can't serve every
special interest in our country without ever adding up the bottom
line.''
   The new Department of Veterans Affairs, which would go into
effect in March, would represent the fifth new Cabinet department
since 1960. Opponents pointed out the irony of it receiving support
from Reagan, who began his presidency promising to eliminate two
Cabinet departments _ Education and Energy _ an idea he later
abandoned.
   The Veterans Administration, according to supporters of the
legislation, already has the fifth-largest budget among federal
agencies and merits being put on par with other Cabinet departments
to ensure that the money is properly administered
   ``This says to the millions of men and women who've worn the
uniform of our armed forces that we care,'' said Rep. Frank Horton,
R-N.Y. He said placing a veterans' advocate at the table with the
president and other Cabinet members will give greater voice to
their needs.
   A primary sponsor of the measure, Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
noted that the VA hospital system is suffering from a $600 million
budget shortfall and that Cabinet status would help it make the
case for full financing.
   ``This will go a long way toward guaranteeing that the veterans
of the future are going to be taken care of,'' Solomon said.
   According to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, the VA
serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors
with a budget of $30 billion. It will dispense $14 billion in
income maintenance and $626 million for education and
rehabilitation assistance this year.
   The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient
beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients
this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000
veterans this year.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Track Medical Waste From Start to Finish</HEAD>

   Congress is moving to slap controls on medical
waste, from the vials of AIDS-infected blood washing up on Atlantic
Coast beaches to the used hypodermic needles picked out of trash
bins by children in the Midwest.
   The vehicle to attack the growing problem of carelessly
discarded medical waste is a bill that would require a so-far
reluctant Environmental Protection Agency to set up a system to
track the waste from creation to disposal.
   The legislation, given impetus by this summer's publicized cases
of infectious materials littering ocean and Great Lakes shorelines,
was passed by the House on Thursday by a 390-28 margin.
   The Senate has approved a more limited control blueprint.
Lawmakers in both chambers say they see no difficulty working out a
joint product that can be sent to President Reagan before Congress
adjourns next week.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, says action is needed because ``the
illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an epidemic
across the country. This waste is not just repulsive, it can
literally kill people.
   ``According to recent federal studies, as many as 18,000 people
each year may contract hepatitis B from accidental contact with
medical waste,'' he told the House. ``Hundreds of those infected
will ultimately die from the infection.''
   The House plan would cover waste produced by hospitals, clinics
and labs in New Jersey, Connecticut and the Great Lakes states of
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
   The program, however, could become national in scope because any
other state could decide to have its waste covered by the plan and
gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting the
tracking system's requirements.
   ``This is a national problem,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
``The medical waste system in this country is broken. It is
overloaded, and in effect it is starting to regurgitate what it
cannot keep down.''
   Expected to form the basis for the final bill, the House plan
would apply to 10 types of medical waste, including blood,
hypodermic needles, scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that
has been in contact with infectious agents.
   The enumerated items would have to be segregated from other
medical waste. The tracking system would have to contain assurances
that a generator knows the waste reached a disposal facility.
   The legislation does not, however, set any standards for actual
disposal, such as burning or using a hazardous waste landfill.
Supporters said there was no time this year to work out these
details. They add, however, that it already is illegal to dump such
waste into waterways.
   Violators of the tracking requirements could be slapped with a
civil fine of up to $25,000 for each day of violation and a maximum
criminal penalty of two years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000
per day of violation.
   Luken said the medical waste problem goes beyond the beach
foulings that closed stretches of oceanfront in New York and New
Jersey the past two summers.
   ``Last year, careless doctors in Youngstown (Ohio) and
Indianapolis put contaminated needles and vials of infected blood
into dumpsters,'' he said. ``Kids found the needles and blood vials
and played `doctor' with them _ splattering blood on each other and
giving each other injections that could have proved fatal.''
   House members said they believe EPA already has the authority to
act against medical trash under various hazardous waste control
laws.
   In 1978, the agency announced plans to regulate medical waste,
but six years later it said lacked evidence those wastes were
causing enough harm to justify regulations.
   Instead, EPA released a package of advice to hospitals on
handling and disposal. Since then, EPA has formed a task force to
rethink the issue.
   ``EPA has dragged its feet on this matter,'' Wyden said. ``EPA
told us that as of this summer, they had budgeted exactly one staff
position to deal with the medical waste issue. That is why we need
this legislation.''

   A new recipe has been developed for fortifying
mother's milk to help premature babies ``barely bigger than a man's
hand'' survive and grow normally, the Agriculture Department said.
   ``The immune properties found in mother's milk are so much more
important to preterm infants because they are subject to many more
infections than full-term infants,'' said Dr. Richard J. Schanler,
physician in charge of the project at the Children's Nutrition
Research Center at Houston.
   But extremely premature babies, some of them weighing less than
two pounds at birth, require more concentrated nutrients than
mother's milk provides, he said.
   Most currently get a preemie formula based on cow's milk until
they reach about three pounds and are growing well. After that,
some may be switched to mother's milk mixed with a commercial
fortifier.
   Concern about the practice of feeding the formulas to the tiny
infants during their first month of life prompted Schanler and a
former colleague, Dr. Cutberto Garza, now at Cornell University, to
look into ways of using breast milk from birth.
   Their research at the center, which is based at Baylor College
of Medicine and is funded by USDA's Agricultural Research Service,
included tests of commercial formulas and new recipe possibilities.
The work was described in a report issued Thursday by the agency.
   Schanler said the new recipe includes mineral salts that are
readily absorbed by the infants, and protein and energy from
powdered skim mother's milk supplied by the center's own human milk
bank.
   Although the recipe is being used for research purposes,
Schanler said he doubts whether it will be feasible to produce a
commercial fortifier made from human milk, noting that there aren't
many human milk banks for this purpose.
   But he said the findings from the recipe research should lead to
better fortifiers so that very low-birth-weight infants can have
the infection fighting factors present in breast milk when they
most need it right after birth.
   The milk would still have to be taken from the mother with a
breast pump, fortified with the forumla and fed to the baby through
a tube.
   The initial concern has been to get enough protein and energy
into the tiny babies, and ``we didn't pay much attention to
minerals,'' Schanler said.
   Calcium and phosphorous were the main problem, a lack of which
could ``compromise growth, impair healing of chronic lung disease
and lead to bone malformations,'' Schanler said.
   The scientists came close to matching the ``in-the-womb
retention levels'' of these minerals by adding calcium lactate and
sodium or potassium phosphate to mother's milk.
   Infants averaging only 2.2 pounds at birth retained 86 percent
of the calcium and 80 percent of the phosphorous they would have
retained if still in their mother's uterus and are ``the best rates
we have seen,'' Schanler said.
   According to Garza, who now directs nutritional sciences at
Cornell, the government's Food and Drug Administration requires
formula companies to add a minimum amount of calcium without
sufficient regard to its form.
   ``That's not enough for these tiny infants,'' Garza said. ``You
need to look at the form as well as the amount.''
   For example, Garza said, the calcium salt added to commercial
formulas is tribasic calcium phosphate, which is not very soluble.
``It's like rock,'' he said. ``Most of it probably doesn't get
absorbed (into the infant's system) but comes out in the stool.
Calcium lactate is much better utilized.''
   Although the scientists recognize that human milk has less
calcium and phosphorous than both regular and preemie formulas,
they say the minerals are in a form more easily absorbed by the
infants. Also human milk may have unknown factors that enhance
infants' absorption and retention.
   Formula companies have not been able to duplicate these
conditions in commercial preparations and compensate by increasing
the concentration of minerals, the report said.
   Another former colleague, Dr. Steven A. Abrams, a physician now
at the National Institutes of Health, said the higher
concentrations of minerals in commercial formulas may benefit the
very low-birth-weight infants after they leave the hospital.
   After discharge, the mothers either chose to continue on
unfortified breast milk or switch to regular infant formula.
Abrams, who tracked the infants for a year, found that the
breast-fed babies had a lower bone mineral content than those who
got commerical formulas.
   But they grew equally well on either, he said. Body weight,
length and head measurements were the same for both groups.
   Abrams recommended that pediatricians regularly evaluate the
mineral status of nursing preemies, but he added that ``the risks
do not outweigh the benefits of breast feeding.''

<HEAD>Psychologists Say Military Needs To Better Understand Stress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychologists who studied the downing of an
Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf say the military
needs to better understand stress and should spend more on
psychological research and improve its crew training.
   The judgment of the Navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down
the Iranian plane July 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by
stress, the psychologists said.
   ``There is much knowledge about how decisions go wrong and how
they can be improved that is not being put to use in military
decision-making,'' Dr. Paul Slovic, a psychology professor from the
University of Oregon, told a House panel Thursday.
   Dr. Steven Zornetzer, representing the Navy's office of naval
research, responded that the service does try to consider stress
and is spending $12 million a year on basic research into
psychological questions. Another $18 million is being spent to
apply the results of that research to Navy programs.
   While progess is being made, he said, ``it must be clearly
recognized that these research problems are among the most
difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum.''
   The hearing by the House Armed Services policy subcommittee was
part of the panel's examination of the destruction of Iran Air
Flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board. It was shot down by
the cruiser Vincennes in the mistaken belief that the commercial
jetliner was a military plane diving toward the Vincennes.
   A Navy investigation attributed the incident to stress-related
mistakes made by the crew of the Aegis-class cruiser, one of the
Navy's most sophisticated warships.
   The Navy said crew members, under battle-caused stress after
just finishing a firefight with Iranian gunboats, misread or
misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the Aegis
computers.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, said,
``Misinterpretations of data provided by the Aegis weapon system
and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up
troubles with man's ability to make fast, accurate decisions in
combat.''
   Dr. Richard Nisbett, a psychology professor at the University of
Michigan, noted that the Vincennes crew was on alert for an attack
by Iranian planes. The crew members interpreted the data to see
what they expected to see, he said.
   ``Expectations can color what people think they see, and what
they remember, to a far greater degree than is recognized by common
sense,'' Nisbett said.
   ``Magicians and card sharks have long made a living on this
principle, and in the last 30 years or so psychologists have
learned a great deal about the scope of the principle in daily life
events,'' he said.
   Nisbett also noted the example of the USS Stark, which was hit
by an Iraqi missile in May 1987, killing 37 seamen. Top officers on
the Stark were disciplined for not firing their weapons against the
Iraqi plane, and Navy ships in the region were on a high state of
alert after that.
   The Vincennes crew wanted to avoid another incident like that
involving the Stark, Nisbett said.
   Dr. Richard Helmreich, a psychology professor at the University
of Texas, said the Vincennes crew members didn't communicate among
themselves well enough.
   ``The communications problems evident in the Vincennes incident
closely parallel those uncovered in analyses of the causes of
crashes in civilian and military air transport,'' he said.
   Dr. Richard W. Pew said another risk arises from the highly
automated, computerized nature of modern warships like the
Vincennes.
   ``Research is badly needed to understand when and just how much
automation to introduce in situations where the ultimate control
and responsibility must rest with the human operators,'' he said.

   A man claiming he had been the subject of
government mind control experiments disrupted an appearance by
President Reagan before a Republican fund-raising dinner Friday
night.
   The man made a long and rambling argument that he had been
mistreated, while guests at the $1,000-a-plate event attempted to
drown him out with applause. The disruption occurred just after
Reagan concluded his address to the crowd.
   Reagan, standing just behind the lectern he'd used for his
speech, seemed puzzled as he strained to hear the man.
   Secret Service agents on the scene made no attempt to approach
the man, who identified himself as William McKnight, 58, of
Inkster, Mich.
   But after several moments of yelling toward Reagan, who was
approximately 150 feet away on the podium, the president
interrupted him.
   Reagan went to the microphone and said that he was having
difficulty hearing the man, although he said the protester seemed
to ``feel strongly'' about what he was saying.
   But the president, showing increasing impatience and anger,
shouted that ``I don't think it's fair to subject the people to all
of this. Why don't you write it in a letter and send it to me.''
   The Secret Service had arrested the same man in 1985 when he
tried to deliver papers about mind control to former President
Jimmy Carter during a Detroit appearance.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked later if Reagan
had felt endangered by the intruder, said, ``No, not at all.''
   ``He just said, `Who was that man and what did he want
anyway?''' Fitzwater said, paraphrasing the president.
   Secret Service Special Agent Bill Corbett said late Friday that
McKnight was interviewed and released. No charges were filed.
   ``He was interviewed. He made no threats against the president.
He meant no harm to him. That's the main thing the Secret Service
was interested in,'' Corbett said.
   Few incidents of this sort have plagued Reagan in recent years
as security surrounding him was tightened substantially following
his shooting on March 30, 1981 by John W. Hinckley Jr. Hinckley
remains confined to a mental hospital in Washington.
   After Reagan told the man to be quiet, the concluding part of
the president's portion of the program proceeded and he left
without incident.
   McKnight did not say how he had gotten into the event, nor
whether he had paid the $1,000 fee. But pressed on that, he said,
``I just walked in.''
   The man stood apart from the dinner tables in an area not far
from the president occupied by a pool of reporters admitted to
cover Reagan's speech.
   It was apparent that Secret Service agents determined the man
was not presenting any physical threat to Reagan, and therefore no
attempt was made to rush him.
   ``I was quiet and let him speak. I was quiet and stood here,''
McKnight told reporters.
   During his tirade, McKnight had asked, ``Why don't you take the
mind control machine off of me, Reagan?''
   ``Why don't you use it on the communists that's here in America,
and why don't you get rid of communism in America?'' he said.
   Several boos emanated from the well-heeled crowd of Republican
donors, many of whom were heard shouting, ``Get out and shut up!''
   McKnight was arrested on April 24, 1985, when he tried to
deliver to Carter a three-page typewritten document saying he was
the victim of a U.S. government mind-control device.
   McKnight, who listed an Inkster, Mich., address on the document,
said the device injured his eyesight and muscles and his ability to
learn and to have sex.
   Two Secret Service agents knelt beside both sides of his chair
after Carter completed his speech. McKnight resisted the agents and
was taken to the rear of the room with his arm behind his back.
   McKnight told reporters Friday night that he was treated for
three weeks at a state psychiatric hospital in Northville, Mich.,
following the Carter incident. He produced a photocopy of what
appeared to be a report from a Northville staffer, who said
McKnight ``rambled'' about the mind-control device.
   A woman who answered the telephone Friday night at the
Northville hospital said state law prevented her from giving any
information about current or former patients. She hung up without
giving her name.
   There were two McKnights listed in the Inkster telephone
directory. Lula Belle McKnight said neither she nor her daughter
were related to William McKnight.

<HEAD>Business Leaders See Strong Growth, Then Slowdown To Stem
Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top business leaders today
offered an optimistic view of economic prospects, predicting growth
will slow enough next year to avoid a severe acceleration of
inflation.
   The Business Council, composed of 62 chief executives of the
country's largest corporations, predicted that the economy, as
measured by the gross national product, will grow 4 percent in
1988, the best in four years.
   ``We are living in a continued strong economy,'' said John S.
Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank. ``We are
very close to full employment, and the inflation numbers ... are
generally felt to be in pretty good shape.''
   The new GNP prediction, reflecting the consensus of the chief
economists of about 20 member corporations, is 1.6 percentage
points better than the prediction last May when the executives last
gathered for their semiannual retreat at this resort town in the
mountains of western Virginia.
   Some economists in the spring still were worried about lingering
aftershocks from the stock market crash of October 1987. Growth
proved to be stronger than nearly anyone anticipated, and now the
concern is that it is too vigorous and likely to fuel inflation.
   But the Business Council's economists are projecting GNP growth
of 2.5 percent next year and less than 2 percent in 1990, in line
with what the Federal Reserve Board considers necessary for a
``soft landing'' of the economy to a sustainable, non-inflationary
expansion. The economists were expecting more inflation, an
increase from a 4.2 percent rate this year to 5.1 percent next
year, but ``no one expected a return to the high inflation rates of
the late 1970s and early 1980s,'' their report said.
   They also foresaw a modest rise in interest rates next year
followed by some easing in 1990. The rate on 30-year Treasury
bonds, which tend to run about 1.5 percentage points below
fixed-rate mortgages, should increase from an average of 9.1
percent this year, peak at 10.2 percent over the next 18 months and
average 9.5 percent in 1990, the council said.
   The business executives were troubled, however, about the
prospects for reducing the federal budget deficit to meet the
targets of the Gramm-Rudman law and for shrinking the trade deficit
without a further decline in the value of the dollar.
   ``The business community generally remains very concerned about
the twin deficits and of what we are afraid and convinced will be
the undesirable price we'll pay for it if we don't solve it,'' said
Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., the health care
company.
   The economic panel saw only negligible improvement through 1990
from the current budget gap of about $150 billion. The Gramm-Rudman
law, however, calls for a deficit of $136 billion in 1989 and $100
billion in 1990.
   The trade deficit is expected to shrink from $170 billion in
1987 to $134 billion this year and to below $100 billion by 1990.
   But the business executives said the dollar, which fell steadily
through 1986 and 1987 before beginning to rebound this year, will
have to start falling again. A cheaper dollar makes U.S. goods more
affordable on overseas markets.
   The economic panel predicted the dollar would be worth 120
Japanese yen and 1.68 German marks, down from 134 yen and 1.88
marks currently.
   ``I think it's unfortunate that the dollar firmed from the first
of the year. I think we were closer to the right range earlier in
the year than we are today,'' said Willard C. Butcher, chairman of
Chase Manhattan Bank.
   The economic forecast was issued at the beginning of a two-day
conference at which the executives will hear from speakers
including Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers; Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board; Secretary of Commerce C. William Verity; Drew Lewis and
Robert S. Strauss, co-chairmen of a blue ribbon commission studying
the budget deficit; and Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., and Rep. Bill
Gray, D-Pa., chairmen of the congressional budget committees.

Bonds</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled Senate is eagerly
lending its support to a plan, already endorsed by Vice President
George Bush, that would help lower- and middle-income families use
U.S. savings bonds to finance higher education.
   The proposal would provide a tax exclusion for interest earned
on a bond that is redeemed to pay for college or vocational
education. Its sponsor, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the
plan is simple and risk-free, giving ``children security in their
future without creating a new bureaucracy or spending program.''
   Even though it was recommended by President Reagan in his
budget, endorsed by Bush in his presidential campaign and passed by
the Senate on Thursday on a 94-0 vote, there is no assurance it
will become law.
   That is because the Senate attached it to a catchall bill whose
main purpose is to correct mistakes and clear up ambiguities in the
far-reaching tax overhaul package enacted in 1986.
   The Senate bill also includes a variety of special tax cuts
costing about $2.7 billion over three years, plus the tax increases
to pay for them. By comparison, the version approved by the House
has about $7.5 billion worth of tax cuts and increases.
   The Reagan administration opposes several parts of the House
bill, and House leaders are reluctant to give in to the Senate on
some of those provisions. With Congress pressing to adjourn next
week for the year, it may be difficult for House and Senate
negotiators to agree on a compromise.
   Senate leaders hoped to wrap up work on the bill today.
   Senators spent most of Thursday debating an amendment that would
have raised taxes on cigarettes, liquor, wine and beer to pay for
part of a big anti-drug bill. The tax increase is likely to be
considered again next week when the Senate considers the drug
legislation.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., was
defeated on a 60-33 vote. A substitute by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
that would have cut a handful of spending programs, including
legal-services aid and low-income energy assistance, to fight drug
abuse, failed 72-22.
   Earlier, the Senate wasted little time approving Kennedy's
amendment to help families pay for education. The provision is not
in the House-passed tax bill.
   Under the proposal, which Kennedy first introduced a year ago, a
family could avoid paying taxes on the interest earned on bonds
that are redeemed to pay for college or vocational schooling. The
full exclusion would be available to families with incomes under
$60,000 and would be reduced gradually as income rises,
disappearing for those whose earnings reach $80,000.
   Present law allows the owner of a savings bond to avoid taxation
on the interest earned until the bond is redeemed; the interest is
exempt from state and local taxes. Kennedy's plan would simply turn
the deferral into an exclusion if the bond is used for education.
   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate, has
proposed a different method of helping finance higher education. He
would create a program under which students could borrow their
tuition and repay it through payroll deductions after they graduate.
   Kennedy said his exclusion would not increase the federal budget
deficit. Included in his amendment is a provision offsetting the
costs of the benefit by eliminating in most cases the personal
exemption now claimed by parents for a dependent who is 24 or older
and a full-time student.
   The Senate bill to which Kennedy's proposal was attached has
dozens of special tax benefits for farmers and other off-road users
of diesel fuel, first-time homebuyers, corporate research efforts
and workers who receive educational or legal assistance from
employers.
   The measure includes a ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved
in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.
   Not voting on the savings bond interest exemption were Sens.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; David Karnes, R-Neb.;
Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Dan Quayle,

<HEAD>20th Century Fox Charged With Contempt In `Block Booking' Movies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. has been
charged with contempt of court for allegedly forcing some theaters
to book unpopular movies in exchange for the right to show popular
films.
   An indictment returned Thursday by a federal grand jury in New
York accuses the company and an employee of violating the terms of
a 1951 antitrust order in booking movies, including the blockbuster
``Aliens,'' from 1984 to 1987. The alleged ``block bookings'' were
made by Leila J. Goldstein, who managed Fox's
Indianapolis-Milwaukee branch office, the grand jury said.
   Fox, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., denied
wrongdoing.
   The action was brought under a consent decree settling a
1930s-era antitrust battle in which the government broke the big
movie studios' control of the nation's theaters. Among the
practices barred by the consent decree is block booking, or
requiring a theater to agree to show one or more movies, often
unpopular films, in exchange for the right to show a successful
movie.
   The grand jury accused Fox of violating a provision against
block booking in a 1951 consent decree the company signed that
stemmed from the antitrust case, according to an announcement by
the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan that was released in Los
Angeles.
   The indictment alleged that Fox and Ms. Goldstein improperly
entered into distribution agreements with theater companies for
several hit movies. The announcement did not name the theater
companies involved.
   The indictment alleged that from January to July 1985,
exhibition of ``The Flamingo Kid'' was conditioned upon theaters
also taking the less popular ``Johnny Dangerously''; from July 1984
to January 1985, ``Cocoon'' was ``block booked'' with ``Prizzi's

<HEAD>Congresswomen Push for Medicare Payments for Mammography
Screenings</HEAD>

   Two congresswomen say they will push for
legislation next year to allow full Medicare coverage for elderly
women seeking mammography screenings, the X-ray technique used to
detect early signs of breast cancer.
   ``We need to promote preventive medicine, not just pay for care
once an illness has set in,'' Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, a member of
the House Ways and Means Committee, said Thursday.
   Mrs. Kennelly said the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act,
enacted into law earlier this year, included a $50 reimbursement
provision for the mammograms.
   ``A $50 mammogram is not readily available in the United
States,'' the congresswoman said. ``The average cost for a
mammogram ranges from $80 to $200.''
   Mrs. Kennelly said the only place a woman can receive a
mammogram for $50 is mobile van clinics.
   ``Most women, especially older women, simply will not submit to
being examined by a stranger in a van in the parking lot of a
shopping mall,'' she said.
   ``Not only is a woman more likely to undergo the test when under
the care of someone she knows and with whom she is comfortable, but
doctors are more able to identify changes over time, and are able
to provide the analysis, counseling and follow-up that are
necessary to effectively care for patients,'' she said.
   A bill introduced by Mrs. Kennelly would remove the $50 cap,
making Medicare coverage for mammogram screenings the same as for
mammograms for women already diagnosed with breast cancer.
   The Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that screening
women over 65 could reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by 50
percent after five years, according to Mrs. Kennelly.
   ``Breast cancer took the lives of 45,000 women in 1987, of which
28,000 were over age 65. Many of those lives could have been saved
if mammograms were readily available and affordable to those
women,'' she told a Capitol news conference.
   The American Cancer Society recommends that women over 40
undergo mammography screenings annually.

<TEXT>
   Editors of the Guinness Book of Records are
debating whether to list Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson as the
world-record holder for his 9.79-second 100-meter run at the
Olympic Games in South Korea.
   Johnson, 26, was stripped of the gold medal he won in the race
Oct. 24 after testing positive for performance-enhancing anabolic
steroids, banned by the International Olympic Committee. The
committee erased his time from the books.
   The International Amateur Athletic Federation banned Johnson
from competition for two years, while the Olympic committee awarded
the first-place prize to Johnson's U.S. rival, Carl Lewis, who had
finished second with a time of 9.92 seconds.
   ``It would be ridiculous to say he (Johnson) didn't run the 100
meters in 9.79, because he clearly did,'' Stewart Newport, deputy
sports editor of the Guinness records book, said Thursday.
   The annual publication lists world records for everything from
sporting events to the heaviest human to the longest mustache.
   ``There's no denying he did the time,'' Newport said. ``That
cannot be taken away from him. We have to consider him for
inclusion, although it has put us in a difficult position because
of the drugs.''
   Editors of the Guinness Book of Records will hold a series of
meetings to consider the issue, Newport said, but he could not
predict a date for their decision. Events from the Seoul games are
too late for the book's 1989 edition, due on bookshelves Oct. 14.
   The Jamaican-born Johnson already appears in an appendix to the
1988 edition of the Guinness book for his previous 100-meter record
run of 9.83 seconds, set Aug. 30, 1987 in Rome.

   Farm lawmakers are turning political heat on
Agriculture Department officials over a tobacco export program
marked by abuses that have become the focus of a Justice Department
investigation.
   ``I think this is the worst disaster for an agriculture program
that I have seen in my eight years in the Congress,'' Rep. Charles
Rose, D-N.C., said Thursday at a hearing of his House tobacco and
peanuts subcommittee.
   At the heart of the controversy is a program providing exporters
with credit guarantees assuring they will get their money for
American agricultural products they send overseas even if the
foreign buyers fail to pay.
   More than $30 million in such guarantees have been provided for
tobacco shipments alone this year by USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service. But farm lawmakers are upset by an array of abuses and
other problems besetting the program.
   The Justice Department is investigating allegations that 14
companies obtained guarantees for exports by saying their shipments
consisted entirely of American tobacco when they actually were a
foreign and domestic blend.
   Lawmakers are irked by a Foreign Agriculture Service policy that
provides guarantees for exports of blended foreign and domestic
tobacco, although only for the American portion. They say the
program is supposed to help farmers by spurring exports and thus
should be limited to 100 percent American shipments.
   The Foreign Agricultural Service also stands accused by
lawmakers and congressional investigators of not finding fraud even
when the service was warned specifically about it two years ago.
   And Rose on Thursday clashed with service Administrator Thomas
O. Kay, saying his claim that guarantees always were provided for
the American portion of blended shipments was the opposite of what
he told the panel four months ago and at variance with
investigative findings.
   The question is a sore point with tobacco-state lawmakers who
contend that a policy revision from Kay last month opens the door
to credit guarantees for blended shipments for the first time.
   ``This is a coverup, Mr. Kay,'' Rose said.
   ``I resent that,'' Kay replied.
   ``I don't care if you resent it or not,'' Rose said. ``You were
covering up a fraudulent practice in the Foreign Agricultural
Service.''
   Initial reports of blended shipments covered by guarantees
emerged from Iraq in 1986, bringing congressional demands for an
investigation.
   At the time, the service dismissed the concern as unfounded.
Followup by the inspector general, however, determined that tobacco
exports consisting of blended foreign and domestic products had
been covered by guarantees as if they were 100 percent American.
   ``It makes my blood boil,'' Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said.
   Kay said he was ``infuriated'' by the disclosures, but added
that he had seen no reason to question the assurances of exporters.
He said the Iraqi report was put down to a rumor started by a rival
exporter.
   The chairman then called on witnesses from the inspector
general's office and the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, who had testified earlier and were
still among the spectators.
   Officials of the inspector general's office of the congressional
General Accounting Office told the hearing that their investigation
indicated guarantees were provided only for exports that were 100
percent American. They said they were told that the only exception
was for a type of baby food that contained a small amount of oil
not produced in the United States.
   Kay told the panel the baby food example indicated that ``the
possibility existed'' that blended exports could receive credit
guarantees.

   Even in its final day, the famed Schwab's
Pharmacy drew celebrities such as Charlton Heston and Meryl Streep
before demolition crews began to make way for a $50 million
theater, shopping and dining complex.
   Hollywood stars, studio chiefs and even President Reagan bid a
nostalgic farewell Thursday to their old haunt.
   Legend, but not fact, has it that actress Lana Turner was
discovered as a high school ingenue sipping a soda at Schwab's in
1933. But it is known that Charlie Chaplin used to walk behind the
counter and make his own sodas, and that Marilyn Monroe was a
frequent customer.
   Ronald Reagan, one of the Schwab's regulars who found work
outside of show business, sent a telegram to its owner, Leon Schwab.
   ``Dear Leon, Do you remember when the only thing I was running
for was a casting call?'' read the White House telegram. ``I wish
you the best, sorry it's gone.'' The message was signed ``Nancy and
The Gipper.''
   Schwab, 78, closed the store in 1983 after 52 years in business
to make way for the development that will replace it at the corner
of Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards.

   Actress Barbara Eden says she's
hoping to land a truly wicked role to dispel her image as a
goody-goody genie.
   Miss Eden portrays a supermarket checker suddenly thrust into
high society in tonight's NBC movie ``The Secret Life of Kathy

   ``Of course she's nice,'' Miss Eden said in an interview. ``What
else would I play?''
   And that's the problem.
   ``I make my living acting and nice roles are what people buy,''
she said. ``I haven't been playing nice people my whole life by
choice, but this is a business after all.''
   The buxom genie in the old television series ``I Dream of
Jeannie,'' Miss Eden, 54, has played a couple of not-so-nice roles,
but she still dreams that someday someone will give her a small but
really nasty role in a big movie.
   ``Then the real Barbara Eden will step forward,'' she said.

   Lee Iacocca is trying to get consumers to go in
for an oil change. For their salads, that is, not for their
LeBarons.
   The Chrysler Corp. chairman dropped by Macy's on Thursday to
promote Villa Nicola olive oil, vinegar and wine, products of the
Tuscany region of Italy where Iacocca bought an estate in 1984.
   ``You can't get this many people out when you're showing a new
car,'' Iacocca said as about 200 shoppers crowded around the
gourmet foods section for a taste and an autograph.
   Iacocca said his family used to bring olive oil and wine from
his estate to American friends, who eventually said, ``Why don't
you put a label on it and sell some of it?'' he recalled.
   Now, Villa Nicola Ltd. markets extra virgin olive oil, balsamic
and Chianti vinegars and red table wine, all of it produced in the
area around the estate, which is named after his father.
   If the company _ run by his daughter, Lia Nagy, and son-in-law,
Ned Hentz _ ever turns a profit, the money will go to the Iacocca
Foundation, which funds diabetes research.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell plans a retirement
village on his Liberty Mountain that will offer senior citizens
everything but a graveyard.
   ``No plans for a cemetery,'' Falwell quipped Thursday as he
unveiled blueprints for the $210 million Liberty Village, which he
hopes will house some 3,000 residents on a site overlooking Liberty
University, the Christian school he founded.
   Falwell said he has already had numerous inquiries from people
interested in paying ``entrance fees'' ranging from $59,000 for a
ground-floor studio apartment to $176,000 for a three-bedroom
penthouse. The residents also would pay an additional $850 to
$1,600 per month as a service fee.
   When they die, or if they otherwise leave the apartments, at
least half of the entrance fee will go to their estate.
   Falwell said residents will probably be the same sort of elderly
Christians who watch his ``Old-Time Gospel Hour'' program and make
donations to his ministry, although the development will be open to
anyone over age 60 who can pay the entrance fee.
   The venture, which includes restaurants and stores, will be
funded and built by Freedom Liberty Group Inc. of Belleair Bluffs,
Fla., a private developer.
   The project will need city approval, and Falwell was careful
Thursday to indicate he was not planning to stage a repeat of any
of his past feuding with Lynchburg over taxes he refused to pay.

   Yugoslavia's complex, cumbersome government structure and
diversity of nationalities are major factors in its worsening
ethnic and economic problems. Here is some background in
question-and-answer form:
   Q: How does the government work?
   A: Yugoslavia is a federation of six republics and two
autonomous provinces that are administrative parts of the largest
republic, Serbia.
   Power rests in the League of Communists, or Communist Party.
Each republic and province has its own party hierarchy for
political leadership and its own government for administration.
   Each republic and autonomous province sends representatives to
the federal party leadership, headed by a 23-member Politburo, and
the nine-man federal presidency.
   Leadership of those two bodies rotates annually. Only the
premier of the federal government, which is primarily responsible
for overseeing the economy and national defense, holds office for
four years. The premier can be removed by a majority vote of
Parliament.
   Q: Why is the system so complex?
   A: The 23 million Yugoslavs include about 30 nationalities. In
an apparent attempt to prevent ethnic strife after his death,
President Tito approved a 1974 constitution giving broad powers to
each republic and province.
   He decreed that all decisions on major political questions must
be approved by the leaderships of all republics and provinces, and
national leadership posts would rotate annually to keep any
republic from dominating.
   Q: What happened after Tito's death in 1980?
   A: Unanimity is so hard to achieve that federal decision are
weak compromises, and the largely state-run economy has
deteriorated as a result. The foreign debt is $21 billion,
unemployment 15 percent and the annual inflation rate 217 percent.
More than 1,500 strikes were reported in 1987.
   Economic and political differences have grown between the rich
northern region, which looks to the West, and the poorer, more
backward south.
   Q: What is causing the current unrest?
   A: A mixture of ethnic strife, economic crisis and an
ineffective political system.
   One fundamental element is the ethnic dispute in Kosovo, a
backward autonomous province in south that was the heart of
medieval Serbia's great empire.
   Kosovo now is dominated by predominantly Moslem ethnic
Albanians, who have the highest birthrate in Europe and are 90
percent of the province's 2 million people. Minority Serbs, most of
whom are Christian, say they are being harassed and began holding
rallies in July.
   Serbs in Kosovo found a supporter in the Serbian Communist party
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, who is trying to impose more Serbian
control on Kosovo and the other autonomous province, Vojvodina.
   Milosevic's opponents accuse him of using the street protests to
seek greater national power for himself and Serbia.

Independent</HEAD>

   President Miguel de la Madrid says the United
States is a difficult neighbor, but living next to such a powerful
country has made Mexico more independent.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, de la Madrid said
that during his six-year term the two countries have improved
understanding on the thorny issue of illegal drug trafficking.
Industrialized countries in general, he said, have begun to
understand that developing nations' foreign debt problems affect
the entire world economy.
   De la Madrid, 54, turns the government over to his successor,
former Budget Secretary Carlos Salinas de Gortari, on Dec. 1, after
presiding over some of the country's most difficult years. Both men
are from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has not lost
a major office since it was founded in 1929.
   ``Relations between Mexico and the United States have always
been very difficult, so difficult that we lost half our territory
in the last century,'' de la Madrid said in the interview Wednesday.
   But the challenge of living next to such a wealthy and
complicated country, he said, has made Mexicans more nationalistic.
   ``Perhaps that is one of the great advantages of being a
neighbor of the United States: our desire to continue being an
independent and sovereign nation that rules its own destiny,'' he
said.
   ``I believe the basis of the problems is a lack of knowledge of
each other,'' de la Madrid said.
   Two-thirds of Mexico's trade, tourism and investment are from
the United States and there is a constant flow of citizens back and
forth across the border. The result is continuous problems of
immigration, trade, drug trafficking and foreign policy
differences, particularly on Central America.
   The United States backs rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government and supports the Salvadoran government's war against
leftist rebels there. It has failed to win the support it would
like from Mexico, which opposes the U.S. intervention and has been
more sympathetic to Nicaragua's government and the Salvadoran
rebels.
   ``There are some in the United States who think that because
Mexico is an independent country with its own foreign policy that
it is not a friend of the United States,'' he said. ``I do not
believe that is true. We are friends of the United States but in
some things we do not think alike.''
   Illegal narcotics trafficking through Mexico has been one of the
biggest sources of conflict between the two countries during de la
Madrid's term.
   President Reagan, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other
top U.S. officials have recognized Mexico's efforts to fight drug
trafficking, de la Madrid said.
   However, he added, ``there are lower-level officials who, to
avoid responsibility, put the blame on Mexico. It seems to me an
infantile attitude.''
   He said he believed U.S. officials have recognized the
importance of demand for illegal drugs in the problem of drug
trafficking.
   ``That is a great advance, since you have to accept the reality
that the United States is the biggest consumer of drugs in the
world and that constitutes an enormous motive to promote production
or transportation from other parts of the world,'' he said.
   He said there were ``slight and tenuous signs'' of understanding
that the developing countries' huge foreign debts have worldwide
implications.
   Mexico's $104 billion foreign debt is the second highest in the
Third World, after Brazil's.
   De la Madrid said both U.S. presidential candidates, Vice
President George Bush and Michael Dukakis, along with European
leaders, have recognized that ways must be found to overcome the
problem.
   ``What is needed now is for that recognition to be converted
into political will and specific formulas,'' he said.
   ``Mexico insists on joint responsibility of debtor and creditor
for the debt,'' he said.
   ``It is not possible that, in the case of the Latin American
countries, we resign ourselves to the economic stagnation of a
growing population with so many needs.''
   He said debtor nations must ``set our house in order
internally'' while demanding ``a fair and realistic deal from
creditors.''
   De la Madrid has maintained Mexico's commitment to keep up with
debt service payments, establishing unpopular austerity measures.
   Subsidies were eliminated, prices went up and workers' salaries
lost more than half their buying power. ``But my concern was to
protect the majorities and to do that we had to defend the
productive sectors and employment,'' he said.

   Drawings and cash prizes may sound like
``Let's Make A Deal,'' but the gimmicks have found their way into a
pair of election races this year.
   A Pennsylvania congressional candidate said Tuesday he is
raffling away $10,000 to ``a lucky taxpayer,'' and a New Yorker is
offering $100 to reporters who can get Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to answer a question about taxes.
   The Pennsylvania ploy was hatched by Republican Ed Howard, a
former state senator who is challenging Democratic Rep. Peter
Kostmayer in the 8th Congressional District of suburban
Philadelphia.
   Howard said he is buying full-page newspaper ads asking voters
to reply to 20 questions comparing Kostmayer's and Howard's
records. The ads attack Kostmayer's voting record on crime,
education, taxes and other issues.
   ``Simply give us your opinion on twenty questions ... send your
answers to us .. and we'll enter your name in a drawing,'' the ad
says. ``If your name is chosen, we'll send you the $10,000.''
   The ads will cost Howard about $20,000, he said.
   Only registered voters can participate in the raffle, and they
have until Oct. 28 to clip out and mail their coupons to the Howard
campaign.
   A Kostmayer statement suggested Howard was running for ``a
Hollywood game show host,'' but Howard countered that the raffle
was meant to counter the free mailing privileges and other
advantages that stack the election odds in favor of an incumbent.
   The raffle does not run afoul of state lottery-sweepstakes law
because the contest does not require participants to make a
contribution to qualify, Howard campaign manager Ann Brackbill said.
   Added Federal Election Commission spokesman Fred Eiland, ``In
general, there is nothing in the law that would deal with this type
of thing.''
   The New York campaign stunt is focused more on the media than
the public.
   Republican Bob McMillan first offered $100 to any New York
reporter who ``successfuly reached Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
himself, by telephone and asked him about any issues of the
campaign and received coherent answers.''
   When a reporter claimed the prize, McMillan offered a new $100
reward to a reporter who could get Moynihan to explain a series of
votes that McMillan claimed raised New Yorkers' tax burden.

   The executive director of a gay rights group
says the Justice Department is ``finally catching up with legal
reality'' by declaring that anti-discrimination laws extend to
federal employees with the AIDS virus.
   An opinion issued Thursday by the Office of Legal Counsel
concludes that the federal Rehabilitation Act _ which protects the
handicapped in the federal workforce or in programs receiving
federal aid _ also applies to employees with the AIDS virus.
   The opinion is in line with a Supreme Court ruling last year and
the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 passed by Congress.
   The Justice Department is ``finally catching up with legal
reality,'' said Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force. Many state handicapped laws have already
been changed to protect people infected with AIDS.
   In view of the Supreme Court opinion and other court rulings,
the Justice Department's revised position is ``a little late in
coming; in fact it's a lot late in coming,'' said David Barr, staff
attorney for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   The opinion says that those with the AIDS virus in whom the
disease has progressed can be excluded from the workplace if they
pose a threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to do
their job.
   Since the available medical information shows that the risk of
infection being transmitted in the normal course of the workplace
is very low, an AIDS-infected employee ``by and large ... should be
treated like any other employee,'' Assistant Attorney General
Douglas Kmiec, head of the Office of Legal Counsel, told a news
conference.
   Kmiec said an AIDS-infected employee ``should be assessed for
his ability to do the job like anyone else.''
   The legal opinion differs sharply from an opinion his
predecessor, Charles Cooper, issued in June 1986, that employers
may discriminate against victims of contagious diseases such as
AIDS based on an irrational fear of contagion.
   The Supreme Court rejected that argument last year, extending
the protection of the federal Rehabilitation Act to people
handicapped by contagious disease, including AIDS.
   The legal opinion adheres to President Reagan's statement of
last August in which he said that federal employers should treat
those infected with the AIDS virus like any other employees, as
long as they don't pose health and safety dangers or performance
problems.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh issued a statement with Kmiec's
opinion saying there are legitimate questions as to whether
existing laws to protect the handicapped can adequately serve AIDS
victims. He noted that the Rehabilitation Act was passed in 1973,
well before the advent of AIDS.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that
affects the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of
resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is
spread through contact with blood, blood products or semen. As of
Monday, 74,809 people had been reported as having AIDS since 1981,
of whom 42,142 have died. No one is known to have recovered from
AIDS.
   Sixty-two percent of those with AIDS are homosexual or bisexual
males, according to the National Centers for Disease Control. As
many as 1.5 million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus, the
CDC estimates.

   Although Connie Mack III had a major
league name, the Republican congressman was still viewed as a minor
player in Florida politics when he began his challenge one year ago
for three-term, Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles' seat.
   Today, a well-funded Mack is heading into the final stretch
against the survivor of a bruising Democratic primary, U.S. Rep.
Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay.
   Since the day Mack formally announced his plans _ Oct. 19, 1987
_ the U.S. congressman has watched his fortunes rise with the
decision of each potential opponent.
   The 58-year-old Chiles, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
stunned his party in December by deciding not to seek re-election.
Then Democratic front-runner Reubin Askew, the former two-term
governor, abruptly withdrew May 7, citing weariness with the amount
of time spent raising funds.
   The decisions by Chiles and Askew triggered a six-way Democratic
race in which MacKay made a late comeback to finish second in the
Sept. 6 primary, then overtook Bill Gunter, the state's Insurance
Commissioner since 1976, in a runoff on Tuesday.
   Polling by the Mack campaign showed MacKay gaining momentum
prior to the runoff so the Republican candidate went after his
likely opponent with an ad campaign titled, ``Hey Buddy, You're
Liberal.''
   Mack describes his rival as a tax-loving, wild-spending liberal
while portraying himself as a conservative Republican cut from the
same cloth as President Reagan.
   ``I think that Florida is a conservative state and I represent a
conservative viewpoint,'' said Mack, a former bank president and
grandson of his namesake, the famous Philadelphia Athletics and
Hall of Fame baseball manager.
   Mack, who was elected to the House in 1982, has one of the most
conservative records in Congress, scoring 90-plus percent on the
scorecards of conservative rating groups and sometimes zero in
marks from liberal rating organizations.
   Mack has criticized his rival for opposing military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels, the MX missile and the B-1 bomber, and for
voting for congressional pay hikes.
   ``There is a clear choice between conservative Connie Mack and
liberal Buddy MacKay,'' said Mack, who has stuck to a theme of
``less taxes, less spending, less government, more freedom.''
   MacKay, an attorney from a wealthy central Florida family,
generally shunned big-spending programs, according to his
congressional record, but is more open to government involvement
than Mack.
   While serving in Congress since 1982, MacKay has been active in
deficit-reduction. During his tenure in the Florida Legislature, he
was a leader in civil rights and open government.
   ``We need to talk about each of our records, what we have
done,'' said MacKay. ``The issues remain the same, who can do the
best job for the state of Florida. I intend to talk specifics
during the general election, I don't intend to allow Mr. Mack to
continue talking generalities and philosophies.''
   MacKay, who has said he would consider new taxes to deal with
the escalating national deficit, also plans to make Mack's
environmental record an issue.
   ``The people of Florida are concerned about the environment and
Connie Mack's record on the environment is one of the worst ... not
just in the Florida delegation where it's the worst, but in all of
America,'' said MacKay. ``That's not a Republican issue or a
Democratic issue. Republicans care about the environment as much as
Democrats.''
   While the negative Democratic campaign between Gunter and MacKay
led to predictions of a divided party, Gunter quickly promised to
work for MacKay. MacKay had attacked Gunter's integrity, while
Gunter had charged that MacKay betrayed Israel, senior citizens and
the anti-drug effort with votes in Congress.
   Mack rode the support of his party's hierarchy and a $2 million
campaign warchest to a primary victory over former U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle.
   Although Merkle entered the GOP primary just 10 weeks before the
Sept. 6 election and without any money, he was able to attract
nearly 40 percent of the vote against the telegenic Mack.
   MacKay, meanwhile, was building momentum. After polls in the
final month before the primary showed him running third, he slipped
past Rep. Dan Mica to make the runoff against Gunter.
   The Republicans have targeted Florida in their hopes of
regaining a majority in the Senate. A strong showing by Republican
presidential nominee George Bush, who is expected to win the state,
could also hurt MacKay.
   And then there is the money factor.
   Mack's campaign has raised more than $4 million, including
$860,000 from the GOP's national Senate campaign committee, and
spent about $3.5 million to maintain his media effort.
   MacKay raised and spent $1.5 million he needed to reach the
general election. The national Democratic Senate Committee is
expected to give MacKay $700,000.

<HEAD>Questions Linger on Quayle's Fitness for No. 2 Job, Analysts Say</HEAD>

   Dan Quayle missed a once-in-a-campaign
opportunity to bury doubts about his competence to serve as
president if need be, several political analysts say.
   Quayle's halting and at times unresponsive answers at the vice
presidential debate to repeated questions about his readiness to
lead the country left some Republicans shaking their heads.
   ``As a Republican, I sat there trying to pull words out of his
mouth,'' said GOP consultant Tom Edmonds. ``Frankly, I think there
are a lot of family dogs that could have answered the question
better.''
   ``I think he was so afraid of striking out that he never swung
the bat,'' Edmonds said.
   During Wednesday's debate in Omaha, Neb., with Senate colleague
Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle repeatedly cited his 12 years' service in
Congress as his principal qualification for the vice presidency.
   When asked what he would do in the event of a presidential
death, the Indiana senator said he would pray for himself and the
country and then call a meeting of Cabinet members and top
presidential advisers. He said little more, though pressed by
questioners.
   Among those dissatisfied with the response was conservative
direct-mail fund-raiser Richard Viguerie, who said Quayle did all
right on all the questions but those concerning his qualification
and fitness for the vice presidency.
   ``I'm sympathetic to the guy because he was too coached ... and
told, `Whatever you do, don't do this and don't do that,'''
Viguerie said.
   George Bush's campaign chairman, James A. Baker III, denied on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that Quayle was overprogrammed
for the face-off. He said he believed there was ``a lot more
spontaneity'' than in the debate between Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   ``I think he did make some headway, but I think that public
opinion was so critical of him beforehand that he had nowhere to go
but up,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia.
   Patrick Buchanan, a conservative columnist who served for a time
as White House communications director for President Reagan, said
``this whole debate was about Dan Quayle and I think, under
pressure, he did quite well. And I don't think anybody ... is going
to say, ``Well, gee, this fellow's not even qualified to be vice
president of the United States.''
   But Vic Fingerhut, a Democratic pollster, said ``I don't think
he (Quayle) did resolve the question'' regarding his qualifications
for the office.
   ``For the hard-core Democrats and Republicans. this thing meant
nothing,'' he said. ``It was just a reaffirmation of views they
already held. I just think that ... people who are in the middle
(undecided) are as interested as the media are in the question
about his fitness.''
   ``Actually, the people who think Quayle's a jerk will still vote
the ticket if they like George Bush,'' he said.

   Dead quail have been placed at several
downtown locations in an effort to attract and identify an
endangered peregrine falcon that has been spotted flying among
office buildings.
   ``We're not sure when it showed up,'' said Joe Werner, an urban
biologist for the Missouri Conservation Department. ``We had two
last year, December through March.''
   The falcon has an identification band on its leg, but
conservationists will need a closer look to determine where it came
from. One of the birds spotted last year was discovered to be from
the Yukon; the other was hatched at a conservation site in
Rochester, Minn.
   To attract the bird and determine its origin, the Conservation
Department is putting dead quail on a ledge on the 18th floor of
the Commerce Bank Building and in a nesting box atop another
building, Werner said.
   Conservationists think the bird may have come from a falcon
release site in Omaha, Neb., the nearest such site to Kansas City.
Six falcons recently were released there, Werner said.
   If the new falcon was hatched in captivity, it should be
attracted to the quail, the main meal at the release sites.
   Wild falcons generally don't eat killed prey, feeding instead on
live birds they snare as they swoop down at up to 200 mph from
their perches, Werner said.
   Werner said this is the migration season for the birds, which
fly each year to South America.
   Workers downtown hope the birds will stick around awhile.
   ``It's really been the highlight of the fall season,'' said Tom
Noack, a lawyer on the 18th floor of the Commerce Bank Building.

<TEXT>
   To invoke the name of John F. Kennedy is to
enter a political realm in which the fine print of history doesn't
count.
   The Kennedy lore and legend are recalled by politicians of both
parties now, 25 years after the assassination in Dallas. But it is
best done carefully, especially by Republicans.
   By the numbers, Sen. Dan Quayle got his history just about right
when he compared his experience and Kennedy's. But he left himself
open to the sharpest rebuff of his Wednesday night debate with Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   It was as though Bentsen had been waiting for the Kennedy
comparison, one Quayle has made before when questions of experience
confront him in his Republican vice presidential campaign.
   He hit the trigger as soon as Quayle said that he'd had as much
experience in Congress as had Kennedy when he sought the presidency.
   ``Senator,'' said Bentsen, ``I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew
Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no
Jack Kennedy.''
   Actually, Quayle hadn't claimed that he was, only that he'd been
in Congress as long. He was off by two years. Kennedy served 14
years in Congress; Quayle has been there for 12.
   But the broader interpretation of Quayle's statement was more
effective ammunition for the Democratic vice presidential nominee.
It has ignited a barrage of Democratic criticism, and ridicule, of
Quayle on grounds that he claimed to be an incipient JFK.
   For the record, Kennedy was elected to the House from
Massachusetts in 1946, served three terms, was elected to the
Senate in 1952 and re-elected in 1958. Quayle was elected to the
House in 1976, beat Democrat Birch Bayh to win his Senate seat in
1980, and won a second term in 1986.
   Bentsen served three terms in the House, two while Kennedy was
there. He returned to Congress in 1971, this time as a senator,
defeating George Bush to win the seat.
   While Quayle may have walked into a new campaign problem with
the Kennedy comparison there are some parallels. Quayle is 41;
Kennedy was 43 when he ran for president, 39 when he made a losing
bid for a Democratic vice presidential nomination.
   Quayle has been under attack for what his critics call a sub-par
congressional record. Kennedy faced the same kind of attacks when
he began his presidential campaign in 1960. His opponents said he'd
accomplished little or nothing in the Senate, and was too often
absent.
   Even after Kennedy had proven himself in presidential primary
elections, detractors questioned his credentials, and complained
that his family fortune was buying his way to the nomination.
   Republican Rep. William E. Miller, the party chairman who later
ran for vice president, said Kennedy was trying to ``turn the White
House into the house that Jack bought.''
   With Kennedy on the threshold of the presidential nomination,
Harry S. Truman quit as a delegate, saying the national convention
was rigged for JFK and suggested that the senator step aside in
favor of ``someone with the greatest possible maturity and
experience.''
   ``Are you certain you are quite ready for the country, or that
the country is ready for you in the role of president?'' Truman
asked in a televised address.
   Kennedy said yes, that it was time for a young man, for vigor,
for a new generation.
   While some of those accusations echo now, so do the distinctions
between the Kennedy of 1960 and the Quayle of 1988.
   Kennedy was a World War II hero. Quayle's candidacy got off to a
shaky start because of controversy over his Vietnam-era hometown
service in the National Guard.
   Quayle's academic credentials have been questioned; Kennedy's
were not. Kennedy had published two books; he'd won a Pulitzer
Prize for ``Profiles in Courage.''
   Richard Goodwin, a Kennedy speechwriter, said the people who
questioned his experience in 1960 were on sound ground. ``They were
right,'' Goodwin said. ``He'd been in Congress a couple of terms
and he'd just started serving his second term in the Senate.''
   ``But people perceived in him qualities of intelligence and
sympathy or understanding, whatever the voters were looking for.''
   The experience argument was replayed in Massachusetts when Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy sought the Democratic nomination to succeed his
brother in 1962. Edward J. McCormack, the state attorney general,
ran against him.
   ``If his name was Edward Moore, with his qualifications, with
your qualifications, Teddy, if it was Edward Moore, your candidacy
would be a joke,'' McCormack told Kennedy in a televised debate.
The observation was accurate, but the backlash was fierce, and the
primary was no contest.
   The name was Kennedy.

<HEAD>Smithsonian Collection To Acquire AIDS Panels</HEAD>

   The Smithsonian Institution said it will
include several panels of the 750-by-500-foot AIDS quilt in its
collection documenting the history of the disease.
   The quilt panels will be added to the Museum of American
History's Division of Medical Sciences.
   The 3-by-6-foot panels were made by individuals to commemorate
the deaths of infants, brothers, sisters, parents and their
children, friends and assorted celebrities, including entertainers
Rock Hudson and Liberace. More than one-fifth of the approximately
42,000 Americans who died of AIDS since June 1981 are represented
on the quilt.
   The panels will join other objects, graphics and educational
materials in the collection documenting the medical and social
history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Cleve Jones, executive director of the NAMES project that
produced the quilt, said Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, had agreed to participate in
ceremonies marking display of the quilt this Saturday and Sunday in
the capital.
   Some 8,288 panels will be laid out on the Ellipse, an open area
behind the White House, and the remainder will be on display at
other points in the capital.
   Once on display, the quilt will measure 375,000 square feet
interspersed with five miles of walkway and 11 miles of trimming.
   Invitations had been extended to the major presidential
candidates and their wives but ``the (George) Bush campaign said
they were busy,'' Jones said.
   The quilt, which began in 1986 when Jones made the first panel
for a friend of his who died of AIDS, has quadrupled in size _ from
1,920 to 8,800 panels _ since its first display in the capital last
year.
   A national tour of the quilt in 20 cities raised $500,000 for
AIDS charities and resulted in quilt-making workshops.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., said he hoped publicity about the
quilt would move members of Congress to complete action on
legislation currently in conference committee in Congress designed
to aid research and AIDS victims.

   When it comes to the marriage
business, the Rev. Ben Jansen will tie the knot in just about any
fashion, just as long as the fashion includes clothes.
   ``A couple called and asked if I would marry them in the buff,''
Jansen said. ``I thought she said `on the bus' and I said sure. ...
I did the wedding, but we all had clothes on.''
   What started as a way to supplement his income as pastor of the
70-member Christ Community Congregational Church seven years ago
has become a passion for Jansen, and, he says, a very important
part of his ministry.
   It wasn't long before Jansen, 42, began getting requests from
people who were turned down by other pastors in town because they
didn't want a church ceremony.
   Though Jansen takes the institution of marriage seriously, he
has no reservations about performing weddings in some
not-so-serious settings.
   ``The Bible talks about commitment _ that's the heart of
marriage. It's not where you get married that matters,'' said
Jansen, who also does marriage counseling.
   Jansen estimates about 80 percent of the weddings he performs
are at homes.
   The rest have been in such offbeat places as the top level of a
downtown parking ramp, on a 400-foot sand dune with both bride and
groom sitting on a motorcycle, on a city skateboard ramp, and at a
construction site where a couple planned to build their home.
   His biggest wedding was performed two years ago on the ice
before 5,000 people at L.C. Walker Arena in Muskegon, just before
the start of an International Hockey League game.
   Jansen said he doesn't pry too much into the reasons a couple
has for wanting to get married in an unusual place.
   ``I learned a long time ago that you can't explain love,'' he
said.

   The birth of Elizabeth Piechocki's first
child was a real labor of love after she won a long battle with
immigration officials to be reunited with her Polish husband just
hours before the baby's birth.
   Mrs. Piechocki, already in labor, traveled to Kennedy
International Airport in New York on Wednesday against the advice
of her doctors to greet her husband, Andrzej.
   She was admitted to Griffin Hospital's maternity ward back in
Derby on Thursday morning and gave birth to her son, 8-pound,
6-ounce Andrew, at 5:26 p.m., said Marian Schmitz, a hospital
spokeswoman.
   ``Everyone's doing fine,'' Ms. Schmitz said.
   The couple met almost eight years ago when both were working in
the village of Ruda-Slaska, Poland. They were engaged to be married
before Mrs. Piechocki emigrated to the United States with her
family in May 1986.
   She visited Piechocki twice in Poland _ first to marry him and
the second time for a six-month stay. She discovered she was
pregnant after she returned from the second visit.
   When she immigrated, U.S. Embassy officials in Warsaw assured
her that her fiancee would be allowed to join her within 15 months.
But a backup in paperwork at the Embassy delayed their reunion,
said Steven Snider, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker,
R-Conn.
   Weicker's office got involved after Mrs. Piechocki called for
help in August, Snider said.
   Piechocki's visa didn't come through until Monday, Mrs.
Piechocki's due date.
   ``Fortunately, she was late,'' Snider said.
   Piechocki's visa allows him to remain in the United States
indefinitely, and he'll be eligible to apply for citizenship in
five years, Snider said.

   Shifts in Soviet ideology are following the
shake-up in the Soviet power structure as Mikhail Gorbachev
solidifies his rule and pursues radical change both in the economy
and in relations with the West.
   The Soviet leader is stepping up momentum, defying the judgment
of some analysts in the CIA and prestigious Washington think tanks
that he is running out of gas and that his colleagues in the
Kremlin are losing patience with him.
   For the next U.S. president the changes are less frightening
than intellectually challenging. The Soviets' new chief ideologist,
Vadim A. Medvedev, suggested in a speech published Wednesday in
Pravda that conflict with the West was no longer considered
inevitable by Moscow.
   ``Present-day realities,'' he said, ``mean that `universal
values' such as avoiding war and ecological catastrophe must
outweigh the idea of a struggle between the classes. Peaceful
coexistence, as we see it today, is a lengthy, long-term process
whose historic limits are difficult to determine.''
   The implication is that the Soviets under Gorbachev want to
reduce the risks of conflict with the United States and concentrate
on economic improvements such as expanding current experiments with
cooperative ownership and renting property to farmers and merchants.
   This could make the current U.S. presidential debate over which
American weapons to develop and which to scrap a little beside the
point. In dealing with the Soviets beginning next January the focus
may be on devising a strategy for dealing not with a potential
aggressor but with a thoughtful adversary who is likely to generate
a steady stream of proposals for arms control and an easing of
regional tensions.
   Joint commitments are being developed even now to outlaw
chemical weapons, halt the proliferation of ballistic missiles
among less advanced countries and revamp the World Court.
   And yet, George Bush, Michael Dukakis and their running mates
have spent little time on foreign policy and even less on how they
would cope with Gorbachev as the Soviet system evolves into
something new and unprecedented.
   When the candidates venture beyond domestic issues, Bush
generally hammers at Dukakis for not supporting development of all
the weapons the Reagan administration is backing. Dukakis, in turn,
tries to be reassuring about his commitment to U.S. defenses. But
how would they deal with Gorbachev?
   Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, are sounding the
traditional conservative themes of a powerful military structure
and keeping a wary eye on the Russians.
   Dukakis and his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, are playing down
ideology and playing up ``competence.''
   In 1960, when Richard Nixon was pondering a running mate for his
first race for the presidency, he assembled 36 party elders at a
midnight meeting in Chicago. The governor of Illinois, William
Stratton, offered this advice: ``You can say all you want about
foreign affairs, but what is really important is the price of hogs
in Chicago.''
   Maybe Stratton was right. And then again, maybe events in Moscow
in 1988 call for a little more attention to foreign policy.

   A Pennsylvania congressman nabbed a startled
intruder who hid out in the powder room of the lawmaker's Capitol
Hill row house while police dusted for fingerprints and completed
their investigation without searching the home.
   Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., said his wife, Susan, called
police early Wednesday after the family dog began ``kicking up a
fuss'' and he discovered that someone apparently had pried open the
front window.
   The police discovered that Mrs. Coughlin's purse was missing,
``dusted the window for fingerprints and got a list of the contents
of my wife's pocketbook,'' Coughlin said.
   ``As they were going out the door, I walked into the powder room
and put on the light and found the gentleman with my wife's
pocketbook on his shoulder,'' he continued.
   ``I don't know who was more startled,'' said Coughlin, 59. ``I
remember lunging at him and the next thing I knew I was on top of
him. I was so angry.''
   Police said they found Coughlin wrestling with the young man.
   ``I guess it was my Marine Corps training,'' the congressman
said.
   Recco D. Bouknight, 22, was arrested and charged with burglary,
city police said Thursday.
   ``Oddly enough, police did not search the house,'' Coughlin
said. ``On reflection now, I think that would be an automatic thing
to do, I guess.''

<HEAD>NRC Attacked Over Proposed Substance Abuse Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed federal regulation to require
regular drug testing of atomic plant workers is under attack on
Capitol Hill for lacking similar standards to curb alcohol abuse.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced a proposed ``fitness
for duty'' rule last month that would require reactor owners to
conduct random drug tests, test employees based on cause, report
drug use to the NRC and mandate personnel sanctions.
   The proposal also would require utilities to submit their own
alcohol programs providing ``reasonable assurance'' that plant
operators are sober, but ``leaves to the discretion of each
licensee the specific measures to be used,'' NRC Chairman Lando W.
Zech Jr. said Thursday.
   ``It is as if the NRC is saying that it is less concerned with
someone being drunk in the control room than it is with someone
being high on drugs,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman
of the House Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee on oversight
and investigations.
   Gejdenson and other lawmakers have long urged the NRC to impose
strict drug and alcohol standards instead of leaving it up
individual utilities.
   Zech, under heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans
on the subcommittee, stressed that the ``fitness for duty'' rule
was simply a proposal and could be changed to include specific
alcohol standards before it is issued next year.
   But he defended the commission's decision to remove strict
alcohol provisions that were in earlier drafts of the regulation.
   Zech said it was more difficult to develop a consensus on
alcohol standards than drug restrictions, noting the different
blood alcohol levels used by various states and federal agencies to
determine inebriation.
   Trying to include specific alcohol requirements in the rule
could have delayed the final regulation ``another few months or
maybe longer,'' Zech said.
   But lawmakers were befuddled and angered by that explanation.
   ``You're sitting around and waiting for (utility companies) to
tell you how to do it,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``Don't
you have some idea what the minimum standard ought to be? This is
not a new subject.''
   Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon, a Republican who is often at odds
with the Democrats' criticism, agreed with Miller and Gejdenson.
   ``I think your judgment needs to be questioned,'' he told the
commissioners. ``It just doesn't make sense'' not to include the
alcohol provision, he said.
   Gejdenson pointed to an NRC document that concluded that alcohol
abuse and drinking-related problems ``are judged to present a
vastly more pervasive work place problem than does drug abuse.''
   Zech said he agreed with that statement, but another
commissioner said drug abuse presented a bigger problem than
alcohol because he believes drug use is more difficult to notice.
   Commissioner Kenneth Carr, a former submarine commander, said he
``threw people out of the submarine force for a first (drug)
offense when everybody else said that was the wrong thing to do. I
didn't ever throw anybody out for being drunk because I could tell
when a guy was drunk and I didn't put him in a sensitive position.''
   ``That may be the problem,'' Gejdenson said. ``We're very
tolerant of being intoxicated as a society.''

<HEAD>Government Seeks Talks with Guerrillas After Rocket Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, faced with relentless
rocket attacks in the heart of the capital, has scheduled an
emergency meeting to discuss ways to make peace with the
U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   Government spokesmen said the Central Committee of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan would meet Monday to discuss
``important matters,'' including efforts to bring the guerrillas
into talks with the government.
   Vice President Abdul Rahim Hatif, in an interview Thursday
during a flight from New Delhi to Kabul, said ``a concerted effort
of all mentalities and from all walks of life is urgently needed.''
   However, he called the guerrillas ``irresponsible people with
complicated weapons'' and accused Pakistan and the United States of
continuing to the guerrillas, who are seeking to topple the
Soviet-backed Marxist government.
   On Thursday, Kabul police escorted three Western reporters to
homes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day. A
total of 42 rockets hit Kabul in less than three hours Wednesday
morning, killing 13 people and wounding 34, according to Qurban
Shayrzad, the city's deputy police chief.
   One home shown to reporters was occupied by a soldier, Mohammad
Shah, who said four women and one boy in his family were killed
when a rocket hit the wall around their home on the north edge of
Kabul.
   At another nearby house, four girls between the ages of 2 and 9
were killed by a rocket, according to their uncle, Mohammad Karim.
   On Sept. 28, at least 33 people were killed and more than 130
wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on Kabul in recent
memory.
   In other attacks around the country, anti-government guerrillas
fired rockets at the southern city of Kandagar, hitting a hospital
and killing dozens of people, Tass reported Thursday.
   The Soviet news agency, quoting its Afghan counterpart Bakhtar,
said three patients and a nurse were among those killed in
Wednesday's attack.
   On Thursday, a rocket attack killed a woman and her four
children in their house in the city of Charinkara in Parvan
province.
   A mine planted by terrorists tore apart a bus Wednesday in
Nangarhar province. Twenty-three passengers were killed and 13
seriously injured, Tass said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters
at a Moscow news briefing that Soviet troops had broken a guerrilla
blockade of the city of Paghman in Kabul province. He said the
siege was ended after several days of fighting.
   Despite government assertions, several Kabul civilians, speaking
on condition of anonymity, expressed belief that some of the
rockets have been fired by Soviet or Afghan troops, who then blamed
the guerrillas in an effort to alienate their supporters.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves Mujahedeen or Islamic Holy
Warriors, have steadfastly refused to deal with the government of
President Najib.
   Hatif, who said he does not belong to the Marxist People's
Democratic Party, is one of four vice presidents named by Najib
four months ago in a show of broadening the base of his government.
   However, key positions in the Soviet-backed government _
including the presidency _ are held by the party or by politicians
closely associated with it.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to replace
one Marxist government with another and fight the nationwide
insurgency.
   The Soviets agreed April 14 in Geneva to withdraw their more
than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan but said last week they
suspended the pullout because of U.S. and Pakistani violations of
the pact. Pakistan also supports the guerrillas.
   Hatif, a 63-year-old businessman, said Thursday that any
government should have both public support and the means to defend
itself.

<TEXT>
   At Massachusetts fire stations, they're talking
about smoking, not smoke.
   A new state law, the first of its kind in the nation, forbids
all newly hired police officers and firefighters from smoking
cigars or cigarettes, on or off the job.
   The statute, enacted last year, took effect Thursday and met
with huffs and puffs of resentment across the state.
   ``This is going to get jammed up in the courts, probably the
very first time they try to enforce it,'' said Lt. Edward M.
Merrick Jr., a lobbyist for the 15,000-member Massachusetts Police
Association.
   The association and other unions contend the law _ intended to
cut disability pension costs _ infringes on their members' private
lives and may be unconstitutional.
   State legislators agree that the law is virtually certain to be
challenged, but they maintain it can withstand constitutional
scrutiny because it affects only new recruits.
   All of the 21,300 policemen and 23,500 firefighters in
Massachusetts are exempt. They can go on smoking as long as they
like.
   But new state and municipal officers will be told that
abstaining from smoking is a condition of their employment. If they
violate the ban at any time in their careers, they could be fired.
   Rank-and-file officers in several communities said they did not
object to the purpose of the law, but felt it went too far.
   ``It's like the seat belt thing,'' said Patrolman Paul Goyette
of the Lowell Police Department, referring to the state's mandatory
seat belt law, which was repealed by voters two years ago. ``It's
good for you, but I believe in free choice. I think you should be
free to kill yourself if you want.''
   The answer from legislators, in effect, was that killing
yourself is one thing, but asking the taxpayers to pay for it is
another.
   The law's primary author, Rep. Kevin P. Blanchette, D-Lawrence,
defended it as a compromise with unions to help shore up the
Massachusetts' pension system.
   Under the state's so-called heart law, any heart ailment a
policeman or firefighter develops automatically is presumed to have
resulted from job-related stress.
   Firefighters enjoy an additional presumption for lung disease
because they frequently inhale smoke and dangerous fumes.
   The presumption makes it relatively easy for a policeman or
firefighter to obtain a disability pension, which provides 72
percent of the officer's final salary, plus an annuity and an
allowance for dependents, all tax-free.
   Other public employees who retire with heart or lung ailments
receive far smaller pensions, unless they can prove that the
ailments are job-related.
   Blanchette said he supports the heart and lung presumptions,
because ``our public safety officers are our first line of defense,
and they do have hazardous occupations.''
   But, he said, the law needed to take the risks of tobacco use
into account.
   ``If a firefighter comes down with emphysema, it's presumed to
be job-related, even if he has been smoking two packs a day for 20
years,'' Blanchette said. ``That doesn't make a lot of sense.''
   Only a few hundred officers will be affected by the law this
year. But starting in 1989, about 1,100 police recruits and 600 new
firefighters are expected to come under the law each year,
according to the state Department of Personnel Administration.
   Robert B. McCarthy, president of the 12,000-member Professional
Firefighters of Massachusetts, said his union is unhappy with the
smoking ban, but predicted the issue will fade.
   ``The generation coming on now is pretty much non-smokers
anyway,'' he said. ``They want to be healthy.''

   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead
says that in meetings next week with East European leaders he will
offer improved economic relations with the United States in
exchange for greater respect for human rights.
   ``Eastern Europe is at an important crossroads,'' Whitehead told
reporters Thursday.
   ``Fundamentally, what these (Soviet bloc) regimes want from us
are economic support, trade ties and political recognition,'' he
said. ``We have stated our willingness to be helpful, provided we
see real progress in political and economic reform, and greater
tangible respect for the human rights of the citizens in each of
these countries.''
   He said he had made this point in previous meetings with East
European officials.
   The United States and its European allies ``must work together
to use this historic opportunity to advance peaceful, positive
change in Eastern Europe for the good of all the peoples of Europe,
and of the United States,'' he said.
   Whitehead said he would re-emphasize to the East European
leaders the U.S. policy of ``treating the Eastern European
countries not as a bloc, but as individual states, each with their
own history and culture.''
   Whitehead said his sixth trip to Eastern Europe starting Sunday
would take him to the capital of each of the Soviet allies in the
region _ East Germany, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Bulgaria.
   He plans to brief officials of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in Brussels on the trip before he returns to
Washington Oct. 21.
   He said he would meet with ``a wide range of people from all
sectors of society,'' not just government officials. State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said his meetings would
include religious leaders.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Way To Change Whooping Cough Bacteria Genetically</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have discovered a way to alter the
whooping cough bacteria genetically in order to produce a safer
vaccine to combat the dangerous childhood disease.
   Dr. Jerry Keith, a National Institutes of Health scientist, said
Thursday that his research team discovered that by merely
substituting one amino acid for another in a single subunit of the
whooping cough bacteria gene, they could cause the bacteria to lose
a toxic reaction that has caused troublesome side effects.
   Despite the development of a vaccine more than 40 years ago,
whooping cough, or pertussis, strikes about 60 million children a
year worldwide. About 1 million die.
   Most children in the United States are vaccinated against
whooping cough during their first three years of life. Thus the
disease is rarely contracted in the United States.
   But pediatricians report about 70 infants a year suffer some
side effect from the pertussis vaccine. This is thought to be
caused by a toxin that is included in the vaccine now used.
   Side effects can include swelling and redness around the
injection, persistent crying among infants and, in severe cases,
brain damage.
   Keith said the goal of his research was to use genetic
engineering to eliminate the toxic effects from the vaccine while
retaining the portion of the bacteria that causes the patient to
develop immunity.
   The pertussis gene was cloned in 1986 by Keith and his team at
the NIH's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont. Since
then, Keith said, the group has been attempting to find the genetic
source of the toxin that causes side effects in pertussis vaccine.
   ``The idea was to go in and change the bacteria genetically so
it is no longer toxic, but still causes a very positive
immunological response,'' said Keith. ``It turns out that if a
single amino acid change is made, that's enough.''
   Keith said the researchers removed the gene from the pertussis
bacteria and placed it inside a laboratory bacteria. They then
experimented until finding which subunit of the gene was
responsible for the toxin. When that unit was found, the scientist
removed one of 234 amino acids in the subunit and implanted a new
amino acid.
   Keith said it will take months of testing in test tubes and
animals before a new whooping cough vaccine would be ready to test
on humans.
   In addition to Keith, other scientists conducting the research
were W. Neal Burnette and Vernon L. Mar of Amgen Co. in Thousands
Oaks, Calif.; Witold Cieplak and Kaarel T. Kaljot of NIH, and
Hiroko Sato of the National Institute of Health in Japan.
   A report on the research is published in today's issue of
Science, the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   Lt. Gen. Louis H. Buehl III, the Marine Corps'
chief of staff, died at Bethesda Naval Medical Center after
suffering a stroke, the Pentagon said. He was 56.
   Buehl, who died late Wednesday, had held the No. 3 spot in the
Marine hierarchy since October 1987, behind the commandant and the
assistant commandant.
   He was a combat veteran of the Vietnam war and previously had
served as commanding general of the Camp Lejeune, N.C., Marine
Corps Base, as a deputy chief of staff for reserve affairs and as
the senior military assistant to the deputy secretary of defense.
   A Pittsburgh native, Buehl was a graduate of Miami University in
Ohio and received a master's degree in Asian studies from the
University of Michigan. He won his first of three stars in April
1982 when he assumed command of the 1st Marine Brigade at Kaneohe
Bay, Hawaii.
   Buehl's decorations included the Defense Distinguished Service
Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with
Combat ``V,'' the Bronze Star with Combat ``V'' and the Navy
Commendation Medal with Combat ``V.''
   He is survived by his wife, the former Georgia Warwick of
Oxford, Ohio; four daughters and one granddaughter. Funeral
services will be held at Fort Myer, Va., next Tuesday, with burial
at Arlington National Cemetery.

<HEAD>Rowan Accuses Mayor Of Trying To Influence Gun Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan says the
District of Columbia mayor and other city officials tried to
``extort'' favorable newspaper columns by suggesting weapons
charges against Rowan could be dropped.
   Rowan claimed Thursday that Mayor Marion Barry and other senior
city officials had suggested they could influence the
highly-publicized weapons case against him if he stopped denouncing
corruption in city government.
   Barry denied the charge.
   ``Unfortunately Mr. Rowan made some extreme charges. ...
However, I am too disciplined emotionally and have too much dignity
to get into a debate with Mr. Rowan,'' Barry said.
   On Wednesday the city announced it would not seek to retry
Rowan, who has called in his column for tougher gun control, on
charges of illegal possession of a handgun and ammunition. A
two-day trial on the charges last week ended in a hung jury.
   During a poolside press conference at his home _ where he had
used the gun last June to wound a teenage intruder _ Rowan said he
was pleased that the city had decided not to try the case again.
   He claimed, however, that the entire episode was ``a malicious,
political prosecution from day one.''
   But Barry countered: ``The fact of the matter is, we have a very
strong gun control law in Washington. If you possess an
unregistered handgun, as Mr. Rowan did, it is a case that should be
discussed between the Corporation Counsel, judges and juries, which
is the way this case was handled.''
   The columnist alleged Thursday that Herbert O. Reid, one of
Barry's closest advisers, had contacted Rowan's son, Carl Jr.,
after the shooting.
   ``My son reported to me immediately that Reid had told him that
the mayor's public posture on the gun issue would improve if I
would `lower my voice' about corruption in the city,'' Rowan said.
   Reid flatly denied the charge Thursday, calling it a ``baldfaced
lie.''
   Rowan also alleged that Barry _ who had criticized Rowan
publicly for the shooting _ called his son June 28 to say that
Corporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke, the city's top attorney,
could not make a decision to prosecute the case without his input.
Cooke refused to comment on the matter.
   In addition, Rowan claimed that on July 29, after the charges
had been filed against him, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., called his
wife at Barry's request and left her a number where Rowan could
``call Barry and perhaps get him to drop the charges.''
   ``I never called Barry because I feared that he would claim that
I telephoned him trying to `cut a deal,''' Rowan said.
   Conyers confirmed making the call, but Julian Epstein, Conyers'
spokesman, said the congressman was unaware of any possible
ulterior motives by Barry.
   Rowan frequently criticizes the district government in his
columns.
   ``None of us can be proud to live in a city that wallows in
incompetence,'' Rowan said. ``You deserve a mayor and other city
officials whom your children can regard as inspirations to great
achievement. What you have now is venality, ignorance, lack of
couth, and an absence of conscience at the top.''

<HEAD>Government Says Emperor's Illness Won't Spur Rightists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is dismissing worries that the flood
of sympathy for ailing Emperor Hirohito will trigger new demands
that Japan revive its military might.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said Thursday the
illness of the world's longest-reigning monarch will not create
pressure to change the post-war constitution, which forbids use of
military force.
   ``There will be no such general voices coming up towards that
direction or to think about the constitution or a change of
course,'' he said.
   The official sought in particular to discredit what he called
the ``strange opinions'' of conservative author Hideaki Kase. The
writer's remarks to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan last
week were reported by some journalists as portending a surge of
nationalism during a post-Hirohito transition.
   Rightists, including some members of Parliament from the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, would like to change the
constitution to restore some of the emperor's traditional status
and allow Japan to be more of a military power.
   The 87-year-old emperor, who took power in 1926, has been
bedridden since internal hemorrhaging caused him to cough up blood
Sept. 19. He is being fed intravenously and has received daily
blood transfusions.
   Hirohito remained in stable condition today.
   Rightists have worked quietly behind the scenes to increase
public sympathy for Hirohito since he fell ill. The effort has been
led by Shizuka Kamei, a member of Parliament and leader of the
Liberal Democratic Party's Fellow Thinkers Council on Fundamental
National Issues.
   Kamei spearheaded the drive to set up nationwide registries for
people to sign and wish Hirohito a speedy recovery.
   ``It's not nationalism or revisionism,'' Kamei has said. ``The
emperor is like our father, and he is sick.''
   Kamei is in favor of revising the constitution. Earlier this
year, he and his group supported a Cabinet minister who was forced
to resign for saying Japan was not an aggressor in World War II but
was simply fighting to protect itself ``at a time when the white
race had turned Asian into a colony.''
   Leftists have criticized both Kamei and the government, saying
they are creating an unwarranted mood of mourning with such things
as the registries and the many cancellations of trips by Cabinet
members.
   Mainstream newspapers and some governing party members also have
criticized the government for overreacting to Hirohito's illness.
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has said government business should
go on normally as much as possible.
   Asked at Thursday's weekly briefing for foreign journalists if
rightists would be able to open debate on revising the constitition
in view of the outpouring of sympathy for the emperor, Matsuda
replied, ``Absolutely not.''
   Matsuda said the correspondents' club made a ``very great
mistake'' by inviting Kase, who he said represented ``just a
handful of people in Japan.''
   Japan's postwar constitution, largely imposed by U.S. occupation
authorities, not only forbids use of military force but also ends
the emperor's role as living god and source of all political
authority. The constitution now defines the emperor as ``the symbol
of the state and of the unity of the people'' and gives him only
ceremonial duties.
   The militarists who ran the country before and during World War
II invoked Hirohito as inspiration for attacks that put most of
East Asia under Japanese rule.
   But opinion polls consistently show the public is largely
content with the emperor's symbolic role and the low level of
military spending in today's Japan.

<HEAD>Jury Says S&L Officials Liable For Damages In Thrift Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Montgomery County Circuit Court jury has
ruled that six former officials of the defunct Community Savings
and Loan of Bethesda are liable for $112 million in damages
stemming from the thrift's demise.
   The jury returned the verdict Thursday after five days of
deliberation, ruling that the officers misused deposits that
financed an ultimately disastrous real estate venture known as
Equity Programs Investment Corp., or EPIC.
   The $112 million was sought in compensatory damages by the
state-run Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund, which took control of
Community when its financial mismanagement contributed to the
state's 1985 savings and loan crisis.
   The defendants in the longest trial in the court's history
included Tom Billman, who founded EPIC in 1975 and later acquired
Community.
   Attorneys for the state deposit insurance fund, which filed the
lawsuit two years ago, alleged that Billman and others drove
Community into insolvency by misusing its deposits to enrich
themselves and to ``feed the EPIC machine.''
   Prosecutors said that Billman and associates ``lived like kings
in palatial homes, paid for from the profit of their personal
companies which continued to grow even after Community began to
fail in 1985.''
   The jury held Billman and his codefendants liable on six counts
each of breaching their fiduciary duties _ partly in connection
with more than $82 million in improper, unsecured loans from
Community to EPIC in the early 1980s.
   The defendants also violated their trust by engaging in numerous
insider deals and allowing themselves lavish salaries, bonuses and
perquisites, the jury found.
   Other defendants were James Deerin Jr. of Chevy Chase and Joseph
Cunningham of Rockville, both members of Community's board of
directors and officers of various holding companies.
   Also named as defendants were Clayton McCuistion of McLean, Va.,
Barbara McKinney of Fairfax, Va., and Leonard Meltz of Atlanta, Ga.
   Billman, a former FBI fingerprint clerk from rural southern
Ohio, worked for real estate firms until he founded EPIC in 1975,
and eventually built it into a $1.5 billion real estate empire. The
brainchild of Billman and his former college roommate, Clayton
McCuistion, EPIC acquired single-family homes and packaged them
into sophisticated tax shelters for investors.

   The state attorney general is asking
for ethics probes of the lawyers who advised Tawana Brawley after a
grand jury concluded the black teen-ager concocted her story of
abduction and rape by a gang of white men.
   The girl's advisers _ lawyers Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason
and the Rev. Al Sharpton _ told her not to cooperate with the
investigation on the grounds it was part of a racist criminal
justice system. They also accused some public officials of
participating in the alleged rape and others of covering up what
happened.
   With Thursday's release of the 170-page grand jury report,
Attorney General Robert Abrams asked a judicial grievance committee
and a judicial disciplinary panel to investigate Mason and Maddox
for possible disciplinary action, which could include suspension or
disbarment.
   ``Their outrageous, irresponsible actions have increased the
atmosphere of tensions between the races, not only in New York, not
only in Dutchess County, but throughout the nation because of the
celebrated nature of this case,'' Abrams said.``Mr. Maddox and Mr.
Mason have made every effort to prevent the criminal justice system
from uncovering the truth of what happened to Tawana Brawley.''
   In a 10-page letter, Abrams detailed 19 statements he said Mason
and Maddox made knowing they were false.
   ``Is there anyone left in America who believes them?'' Gov.
Mario Cuomo asked Thursday evening.
   Although Abrams did not formally recommend action against
Sharpton, he said his actions were ``deplorable, disgraceful,
reprehensible, irresponsible,'' and said the activist is under
investigation by his office and possibly that of U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani of Manhattan.
   The report summarized a seven-month investigation that cost the
state at least $620,000, Abrams said.
   ``We have the facts. We have solved the case. The allegations
she had made are false,'' Abrams said.
   The grand jury provided no reason for Miss Brawley to lie, but
its report noted that she was beaten by her mother after spending a
weekend away from home in May 1986 and punished by her mother's
live-in boyfriend, Ralph King, for coming home from a party at 5
a.m. shortly before her disappearance.
   There was ``no evidence that any sexual assault occurred,'' the
report said. Microscopic examination of physical evidence,
including fibers from her jeans, boots and blouse, suggested that
she had been in her family's former Wappingers Falls apartment the
four days she claimed she was held captive.
   The report said Miss Brawley apparently burned a hole in her own
pants, scrawled the word ``nigger'' on her shoe, smeared dog feces
on her body and clothing, and stepped into a plastic garbage bag in
front of the vacant apartment in the town 75 miles north of New
York City.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28 in the plastic bag, covered with
dog feces and with ``KKK'' and ``nigger'' written on her body. She
told police she was abducted and raped by six white men, one of
whom showed a badge.
   Two officials whom the advisers accused of taking part in the
attack _ Assistant District Attorney Stephen Pagones and former
Fishkill Police Officer Harry Crist Jr. _ were exonerated in the
report.
   ``I've been saying right along that I have nothing to do with
Tawana Brawley,'' said Pagones, who has threatened to sue the
advisers.
   Crist killed himself shortly after Miss Brawley was found, but
the report said there was no evidence that the suicide had any
connection with the case.
   The advisers stuck by their version of events.
   ``What should we expect from 21 whites from Dutchess County?''
said Mason, referring to 21 whites on the panel of 23. ``It is
clear they never intended to arrest and prosecute those people who
did this to Tawana Brawley.''
   Sharpton told a rally of about 200 people outside The New York
Times on Thursday night that the report contained contradictions
and that Miss Brawley would give her reaction at a press conference
Saturday in Chicago. The Times had reported on the grand jury's
findings last week.
   Miss Brawley refused to talk to reporters Thursday as she left
her new Virginia Beach, Va., home for school.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National lawmakers have passed a bill
barring Nicaraguans from accepting any assistance from the U.S.
government, including humanitarian aid.
   Meanwhile, opposition leaders assailed a new emergency law that
gives President Daniel Ortega sweeping powers to curb civil
liberties.
   ``The new law consolidates the dictatorial and totalitarian
state, and just as in the Chile of (President Gen. Augusto)
Pinochet, the Nicaraguan people should say `No' to the
Sandinistas,'' said Erick Ramirez, president of the Social
Christian Party. Chileans voted Wednesday against letting Pinochet
extend his 15-year rule.
   Ortega's leftist Sandinista party controls the Assembly and the
government of Nicaragua.
   The anti-assistance bill, approved Thursday by the National
Assembly, prohibits all aid approved by the U.S. Congress and
destined for opposition groups, the Roman Catholic Church, labor
unions and individuals. Violators face between four and 12 years
imprisonment under the law.
   A week ago, President Reagan signed a $27 million, 6-month
humanitarian aid package for Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras agreed March 21 to suspend
offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to the
7-year-old war stand at an impasse. They have repeatedly accused
each other of truce violations.
   The National Endowment for Democracy, an arm of the U.S.
Congress, has provided more than $600,000 for civic opposition
groups in Nicaragua.
   They include La Prensa, the nation's only opposition newspaper;
two anti-government labor unions; the Superior Private Enterprise
Council; the Nicaraguan Conservative Party; and the Nicaraguan
Democratic Coordinate.
   ``This leaves opposition parties at a disadvantage, including
those that cannot prepare for future elections,'' said Clemente
Guido, leader of the Democratic Conservative Party, speaking of the
aid ban.
   The emergency powers law, approved Wednesday by the Assembly,
gives the president authority to declare a state of emergency for
reasons of war, economic crisis or national disaster.
   It allows him to close news media, block mail, take over private
vehicles and businesses, make preventive arrests, and close the
nation's borders to individuals.

   Four Americans entered Laos today
and began floating dollar bills down the Mekong River to advertise
a $2.4 million reward for missing U.S. servicemen, but the Thai
navy scooped up most of the money.
   The Americans dumped the money, stamped with the reward offer
and sealed in plastic envelopes, into the river after their two
boats moved about 220 yards into Laotian waters.
   They stuffed other bills into a toy boat guided by remote
control towards the Laotian shore.
   However, a Thai naval patrol boat waved the Americans back to
the Thai side of the river and retrieved 62 of about 100 packets
tossed into the river, then returned the money.
   ``It won't work. It's incredibly stupid,'' said one Thai navy
officer.
   Two members of the American team were arrested earlier this week
after entering Laos. They are believed still held by Laotian
authorities.
   The Americans are offering $2.4 million to any Laotian,
Cambodian or Vietnamese who brings an American out of these nations.
   The Americans, members of a group called National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, say the reward money has been
pledged by 21 U.S. congressmen and others in the United States.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
from fighting in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three governments
deny holding live Americans, and Laos and Vietnam are helping
Washington resolve the issue.
   The four Americans are Ted Sampley, a former Green Beret from
Kingston, N.C.; William Sullivan, of Jacksonville, N.C., a Marine
Corps veteran of the Vietnam War; Lynn Hampton, of Winter Haven,
Fla., a nurse during the war; and Bruce Adams, a dentist from
Laramie, Wyo.
   Thai navy officials said their entry into Laotian waters could
jeopardize Thai-Laotian relations.
   ``We don't want this to become a problem between Thailand and
Laos,'' said one official at the naval station in Khong Chiam.
``Entering Laotian waters will give our neighbors the impression
that we endorse this activity.''
   The Mekong forms a boundary between Laos and Thailand and flows
to Cambodia and Vietnam. Although Thai-Laotian relations are
improving, a number of clashes have occurred between the two
countries since the 1975 communist victory in Laos.
   The 62 packets of money were given back to the Americans, who
distributed some to local children and dropped others into the
Mekong from the Thai shore. About two dozen children leaped in to
retrieve as many as they could.
   The mood turned festive as Ms. Hampton handed out ballons and
reward stickers to excited youngsters.
   The Americans last saw their toy boat near the Laotian side of
the river, which is about a half-mile wide at the spot.
   Two members of their group were captured by Laotian authorities
Sunday when they hired a fishing boat, dropped bills into the
Mekong, and then went on to a Laotian village.
   Thai police say Donna Long, of Jacksonville, N.C., and James
Copp, of Hampstead, N.C., have been moved from the river village to
Pakse City and possibly the Laotian capital of Vientiane.
   The U.S. Embassy in Laos said it has not been informed of their
whereabouts or status.

   A federal judge sharply criticized Iran-Contra
prosecutors for filing charges in the nation's capital against a
former CIA station chief for crimes who allegedly committed across
the Potomac River in Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. questioned a proposal
by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to dismiss all the charges
against Joseph F. Fernandez so prosecutors could seek a new
indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby Alexandria, Va.
   ``I don't think it's a simple matter of I'll dismiss it and let
you go to Virginia and re-indict it,'' Robinson told Laurence
Shtasel, an associate independent counsel, on Thursday.
   The judge did not indicate how he would rule on Walsh's request,
which was made in a response to a defense motion to dismiss four of
the indictment's five counts on the ground those alleged offenses
occurred at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. instead of in
Washington.

   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said on Thursday,
however, that ``it's our view that issues involving the use of
force and national security do not belong in the International

   Mrs. Oakley said the possibility of using the court more in
resolving international disputes did not involve a change in the

<TEXT>
   The leader of the political arm
of the leftist rebel movement plans to run for president during
national elections in March, a leftist coalition says.
   Also Thursday, several hundred guerrillas attacked a southern
civil defense post, killing one soldier and wounding three, the
army said. A rocket grenade struck the National Assembly building
but caused no injuries.
   The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three small leftist
parties, said Guillermo Ungo, a lawyer, would run for president and
Reni Roldan, a physician, would be its vice presidential candidate.
   Ungo is president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, which
is allied with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
umbrella organization of four guerrilla groups fighting the
U.S.-backed government.
   The Democratic Convergence represents the left's first
participation in elections since 1977. The left previously
contended the civil war made fair elections impossible.
   Up to 400 guerrillas participated in the pre-dawn attack on the
civil defense post in Zaragoza, 10 miles south of San Salvador, an
army sergeant said. His face was bandaged and his clothes were
still covered with blood from a shrapnel wound.
   ``They hit us hard, but they also have dead,'' said the
sergeant, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They attacked us
on all sides but we managed to fight them off.''
   He said 12 men were on duty at the time of the attack, which
lasted three hours. He did not elaborate on the guerrilla dead.
   Rebels also destroyed the local office of ANTEL, the state-owned
telecommunications enterprise, and blew up two utility poles with
transformers, causing a blackout of the surrounding area, the
sergeant said.
   At the National Assembly, a rocket-propelled grenade struck the
wall of a stairway leading to the main assembly chamber, National
Police Col. Jose Rodriguez said. Spectators were going up the
stairs to view the morning session when the projectile struck, but
no one was hurt, Rodriguez said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which knocked
some stones loose and left a small hole in the wall.

<HEAD>Shultz Irate Over Hostage Deal Reports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has
sharply denied reports that Washington is secretly negotiating with
Iran for release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   Shultz said that anyone who claims to be a U.S. envoy to such
negotiations is lying. ``Anyone who tries to cut across our
policies should butt out,'' he added.
   His remarks were reinforced by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, who denied categorically at a separate news
conference Thursday that the United States and Iran had opened
talks on hostages or any other subjects.
   Shultz made his remarks Thursday at a news conference during his
visit to New York for the fall session of the 43rd U.N. General
Assembly. He was reacting to a spate of recent reports that the
United States is involved in secret negotiations for the release of
hostages.
   He gave no specifics about individuals who ``nominate
themselves'' as government representatives but suggested the
practice is widespread.
   ``What's wrong is that these people forever seem to have it in
their minds that some kind of deal can be struck, and they want to
be negotiators.
   ``And we keep driving it home: There is not going to be any
deal. The hostages should be released.''
   Shultz responded to questions about statements in Paris by
former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr of Iran. Bani-Sadr said an
agent of Vice President George Bush, Richard Lawless, negotiated
the release from Lebanon on Monday of Mithileshwar Singh, a U.S.
resident who is a citizen of India.
   Other reports said the United States offered money or weapons to
Iran in exchange for the release of nine Americans missing in
Lebanon. Most of them are believed held hostage by pro-Iranian
kidnappers.
   Shultz said the United States is prepared for talks with Iran on
the Iran-Iraq war, hostages, and terrorism.
   But he said no direct talks have taken place. He said messages
are exchanged with Iran through governments in contact with both
countries.

<HEAD>Four Senators Seeking Safety Review Of Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four U.S. senators are seeking an independent
safety review of the Savannah River Plant after disclosures that up
to 30 major mishaps over three decades went unreported and in the
wake of an equipment failure that released radioactive gas into the
air.
   The escape Thursday of less than 0.01 millirems of tritium gas
into the atmosphere posed no health threat, said plant spokeswoman
Becky Craft. A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest
X-ray totals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft.
   Workers at the U.S. government-owned plant, the nation's sole
producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were not evacuated.
   In Washington, Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., James McClure,
R-Idaho, Bennett Johnston, D-La., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., called
Thursday for an investigation by the Advisory Committee on Nuclear
Facilities Safety, which was established by Energy Secretary John
Herrington to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear
facilities.
   At the state Capitol in Columbia, 60 miles to the northeast, a
dozen people held a two-hour vigil to demonstrate their concern.
   But in downtown Aiken, most of the customers at Jeff Scott's
beauty and barber shop said Thursday they were unconcerned about
problems at the nearby plant.
   ``Everybody's nonchalant who comes in the shop. They're more
concerned about jobs than danger,'' he said. ``But I'm concerned. I
want to know if there's any danger to the environment, what kind of
danger there'd be to our health.''
   ``It's been there for 30 years and nobody's died yet,'' said
Aiken Mayor H. Odell Weeks.
   Disclosures about problems at the sprawling plant began last
week, when two congressional committees were told that a number of
serious reactor accidents were kept secret for 31 years.
   An internal Energy Department report released Wednesday
concluded that the plant's management undermines safety and
deviates from ``practices common to well-run nuclear plants.'' The
report also cited the undisclosed accidents.
   The draft report criticized the Energy Department and Du Pont,
which operates the plant under contract, for poor staff training,
poor communications and sloppy operating procedures that it said
have undermined safety.
   The 50-page report made a host of recommendations, including
stepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they become
serious.
   A spokesman for Du Pont said company officials had not seen the
report, but already moved to correct some of the deficiencies it
cited.
   Weeks, who has been mayor of the town of 15,000 people for half
of his 80 years, said: ``We've felt we're living in as safe a place
as we can. I'm not at all concerned about the townspeople's
safety.''
   When Aiken residents talk of the plant, which they call ``SRP,''
they speak of jobs and the economic prosperity the prime employer
has meant to the community of tree-lined streets and the
surrounding area near Georgia.
   Anne Smith, owner of the Four Generations gift and antique shop
on the town's main plaza, said: ``The opponents to SRP are raising
questions that need to be made, but there are some people who
become very negative when you go against what's already there.
   ``They have a secure job with great benefits. People don't
question that after a while.''

   The thigh-baring mini skirt is gone, but the
sexy look survives on the Milan runway with bare midriffs and more
during this week's spring-summer 1989 Italian ready-to-wear
presentations.
   It is true that the overall impression of the five-day showings,
which ended Thursday, is calm and relaxed, with long skirts and
loose pants replacing the hip-hugging, supershort items which shook
the fashion world last fall.
   But it is also true that some of the more candid above-the-waist
shots, favored by the almost all-male crew of fashion
photographers, could never appear in a U.S. paper.
   The boldest of these, a full-front of the tiny-breasted
Icelandic model, Brynja, at the Gianni Versace show wearing a sheer
chiffon blouse with nothing underneath, was widely published in the
Italian press, including the prestigious Milan daily, Corriere
della Sera.
   But bare breasts are everyday fare in this country, where
topless sunbathers lie side-by-side with picnicking families on
beaches, television puts few veils on its dancers in variety shows,
and family magazines display nudity on the cover.
   Most torsos were not as boldly bared as Brynja's, but the nude
look of the 1960s is certainly making a come back.
   Many designers _ including Gianfranco Ferre; Keith Varty for
Byblos; Moschino; and of course hot-blooded Versace, champion of
the tightest version of last year's miniskirt _ bared the flesh.
   Some presented bolero jackets over a nude midriff, others cut
their tops so short that they did not cover the essential, and
others still dipped below the waist to bare the navel, while they
covered the bosom in bandeau bras.
   At times, the nude look passed for ethnic, as in the many
outfits which drew inspiration from the tropics. At others, it was
less innocent, as in the Ferre and Versace evening wear, where it
was very definitely intended for disco drama.
   The bared midriff is sure to offer consolation to the male
population, which judging from the comments heard off the Milan
runway, are bemoaning the demise of short skirts for next year's
warmer weather. However, whether women will be as easily seduced by
the new look remains to be seen.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the grand jury report on the Tawana
Brawley case:
   _``Based upon all the evidence that has been presented to the
grand jury, we conclude that Tawana Brawley was not the victim of a
forcible sexual assault by multiple assailants over a four-day
period. There is no evidence that any sexual assault occurred.''
   _``The grand jury further concludes there is nothing in regard
to Tawana Brawley's appearance on Nov. 28 that is inconsistent with
this condition having been self-inflicted.''
   _``There is no evidence that a cover-up occurred or was
attempted in this case.''
   _``Based upon our investigation, the grand jury has found no
legally sufficient evidence to charge any person with a crime or to
establish that a crime occurred.''
   _``There may be questions that some think should be answered
that are not dealt with by this report. The grand jury, however,
may not go beyond the limitations imposed upon it by law. We
believe that we have answered all those questions that we were
lawfully permitted to address.''
   _``At some point between Tuesday evening, Nov. 24, and the time
she was found on Saturday, Nov. 28, Tawana Brawley had significant
contact with and spent a period of undetermined duration in
Apartment 19A (the former Brawley family apartment in Wappingers
Falls, N.Y., outside of which she was found).
   _``All the items and instrumentalities necessary to create the
condition in which Tawana Brawley appeared on Saturday, Nov. 28,
were present inside of or in the immediate vicinity of Apartment
19A. ... The razor blade found inside Apartment 19A is consistent
with the instrument used to cut the word ``NIGGER'' into the side
of Ms. Brawley's pink shoe and to cut open the white boots. There
was no blood found inside the shoe and we conclude that the shoe
could not have been worn when cut. ... The feces found on the pink
blouse and shoe Ms. Brawley was wearing when found, (and) on the
gloves found in the bag in which she was discovered ... contained
dog hairs which were consistent with the hairs from a dog owned by
the occupant of Apartment 21A.''
   _``There is no medical or forensic evidence that a sexual
assault was committed on Tawana Brawley. If a 15-year-old girl has
been forcibly raped or sodomized by multiple assailants over a
four-day period, there is a high probability that medical or
forensic evidence would have been found.''
   _``When discovered, Tawana Brawley was not suffering from
exposure. If an individual had been outdoors continuously from
Tuesday evening, Nov. 24, to Saturday afternoon, Nov. 28, when the
temperature several times dropped to the freezing point, there is a
high probability the individual would have suffered from exposure.
... When discovered, Tawana Brawley was not malnourished. ...''

   The company, CRA, said the wreckage was discovered two months
ago in rugged terrain near Wau, where the company is prospecting
for gold. Wau is about 185 miles north of Port Moresby, the capital.
   Word of the find was delayed while the geologist who stumbled
upon the wreck researched the plane's history, the company said.
   Papua New Guinea, just north of Australia, was the scene of
bitter fighting during the Pacific war.
   In his report, made available to The Associated Press in Sydney,
Australia, geologist Grant Malensek identified the aircraft as
number 1-38658 of the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron of the 374 Troop
Carrier Group, U.S. 5th Air Force.
   The crew reported missing were: Pilot 1st Lt. Robert H.
Schwensen, co-pilot 1st Lt. Henry Sherman, engineer Cpl. Emil
Errickson, radio operator Pvt. Clifford Fawn and trainee gunner
Edward Piekutowski. Their hometowns were not available. Malensek
said only Errickson's dog tag was clearly identifiable.
   CRA's report could not be immediately confirmed independently.
   A U.S. recovery team arrived at the crash site Wednesday and
will remain there until all the remains are recovered, Malensk said.
   ``There's not much left,'' a CRA official said. ``It obviously
nose-dived into the side of a hill. Only the tail is sticking out
of the ground. In all probability the rest was covered by later
landslides.''
   Malensek said in his report that the plane was probably shot
down by Japanese Zero fighters on Feb. 7, 1943.
   He said it was one of three U.S. transport planes that had taken
off from Jackson's Field in Port Moresby and was probably carrying
foodstuffs and supplies. The other two planes survived and reported
the crash.
   The National Museum in Port Moresby confirmed that the plane had
been shot down while the Battle of Wau was in its last stages with
the Japanese being pushed back over the mountains to Salamaua.
   He said the file on the plane was closed in 1949 with the five
men classified as missing, presumed dead.
   Other wreckages found in the area include another DC-3 and a
B-17 Flying Fortress, according to CRA, a major gold explorer in
Papua New Guinea.

   Share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today while the U.S. dollar inched up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 133.50 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's
close of 133.30 yen. Opening slightly higher at 133.62 yen, the
currency moved in a tight range of 133.45-133.63 yen, with spot
trading reaching $2.73 billion.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finally rebounded by
regaining 85.93 points or 0.32 percent to finish trading at
27,258.27. It was the first time the index rose since Oct. 1, after
falling for five straight days.
   Although share prices lost 22.79 points to move to 27,149.55
shortly after the market opened and fell lower afterwards, the
market reversed the trend in the middle of the afternoon session.
   ``The morning session opened majorly affected by the pessimistic
mood following Thursday's loss,'' said a dealer with Daiwa
Securities in Tokyo, adding, ``but the trend changed as high-tech
issues recovered.''
   When the index hit the 26,000 level, investors began buying in
order to make profits, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``But trading was thin in a wait-and-see mood ahead of the U.S.
unemployment figure later tonight and a three-day holiday,'' the
dealer added. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at
500 million shares.
   On the foreign exchange, ``the dollar-yen rate was hardly
moving,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who also spoke
anonymously.
   ``Trading was thin, and the spot trading was almost half of what
the market normally trades,'' he said.
   ``It might have happened regardless of the U.S. unemployment
rate and the three-day holiday, but somehow the rate has been
fluctuating,'' he added.
   Oct. 10 is a national holiday for both Japan and the United
States. For Japan it is Health-Sports Day, while the United States
celebrates Columbus Day.
   Both stock and foreign exchange markets in Tokyo are closed on
the second Saturday every month.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ About 800 street cleaners and
garbage collectors demonstrated in front of City Hall to protest
their firings by newly-appointed Mayor Carmen Christophe, Radio
Haiti-Inter reported.
   Other municipal employees joined the demonstrators Thursday and
went on strike, saying the mayor had no right to fire poor people
and was incompetent, the radio said.
   Ms. Christophe accused the garbage-truck drivers of being
followers of ousted Mayor Franck Romain, who is reputed to be a
leader of the dreaded Tonton Macoutes, the feared henchmen of the
Duvalier regime.
   Romain is suspected of being a mastermind of the Sept. 11 attack
on the St. Jean Bosco church that left 12 dead and more than 70
wounded.
   Rank-and-file soldiers named the massacre at St. Jean Bosco as
one of the reasons for the Sept. 17 revolt in which they overthrew
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. Namphy, now in exile, was replaced by Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The flamboyant Ms. Christophe, a money-lender and owner of a
chain of lottery shops, was named to replace Romain by the
rank-and-file soldiers who engineered the coup.
   She accused the garbage collectors Thursday of having stolen
6,000 gallons of gasoline and 50 of the city's 56 garbage trucks,
and of switching old tires for new ones and selling them.
   In another incident Thursday, several hundred demonstrators
briefly blocked traffic on the highway between the capital and the
International Airport. The demonstrators were protesting their
expulsion Tuesday from what they claim to be state-owned lands
abandoned by dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier when he was ousted in
February 1986.
   One person was killed and three wounded when soldiers from the
Presidential Guard expelled the squatters.
   Radio Soleil said five soldiers were seen among the
demonstrators, apparently expressing solidarity with the protest.
   Also Thursday, troops dispersed several dozen people in
Port-de-Daix, a northern port town, who demonstrated against
allegedly incompetent government officials, Haiti-Inter said.

   President Roh Tae-woo will meet with
President Reagan in Washington to discuss trade policies between
the two nations and other issues, a government official said today.
   The talks will take place Oct. 20 after Roh addresses the U.N.
General Assembly on Oct. 18, the official said.
   The official, who asked not be identified, said Roh will discuss
ways to improve relations with North Korea and other communist
countries, including the Soviet Union.
   The official said the Reagan and Roh also will discuss trade
between the two nations. U.S. officials have demanded that South
Korea relax restrictions on U.S. imports in South Korea.
   Roh and Reagan last met in September 1987 when the Roh visited
Washington as the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic
Justice Party.
   Roh won the country's first direct presidential relections in 16
years in December and was inaugurated in February.
   Roh is to leave Seoul on Oct. 12 to address the U.N. General
Assembly for the first time as a chief executive of South Korea. He
will be accompanied on the trip by Foreign Minister Choi Kwang-soo.
   South and North Korea are not U.N. members but the world body
has decided to hear speeches from the two Koreas. It was not known
who would speak for North Korea.

   Communist party leaders in a
troubled province were ousted after thousands of protesters stormed
their headquarters in the worst violence in three months of ethnic
unrest. The shake-up boosted Serbia's drive for greater control
over two provinces.
   At lest 100 people were injured Thursday when an estimated
30,000 people in Novi Sad, capital of Vojvodina province, surged
toward riot police guarding party headquarters, state-run media
said.
   The demonstrators threw rocks and broke about 20 windows during
the 30-hour siege. The state news agency Tanjug said two
firecrackers caused a fire that was quickly extinguished.
   Fourteen policemen were among the injured, two seriously, it
said. Six people were hospitalized and four were reported arrested
before the crowds were dispersed.
   The 15 members of the Communist party's Politburo in Vojvodina
province pledged to step down after the demonstration.
   Tanjug reported later Thursday that the party's Central
Committee in the province voted 87-10 to dismiss the Politburo, the
region's highest political body.
   The mass resignation in Vojvodina is a major victory for Serbian
Communist party leader Slobodan Milosevic, who has led his
republic's Serbian drive for more control over Vojvodina and a
second province, ethnically troubled Kosovo.
   The Communist party leaderships in both provinces had resisted
the Serbian drive for more control. The Kosovo leadership is now
expected to come under pressure to step down.
   The shake-up came two days after national Communist party chief
Stipe Suvar, faced with the mounting unrest, promised sweeping
personnel changes in the ruling national Politburo and
policy-setting Central Committee at or before a Central Committee
meeting scheduled for Oct. 17.
   Vojvodina provincial leaders had promised to resign after
meeting with Serbian party leaders in Belgrade, the nation's
capital 40 miles to the south.
   Tanjug quoted the Serbian party as saying: ``The Vojvodina
leadership has been deaf to the demands of the working class and
other citizens. A serious split has occurred between the Vojvodina
leadership and the people.''
   Provincial party leader Milovan Sogorov said a 10-member
provisional group would be established while new leaders were
chosen for Vojvodina, a flat region that produces most of the
nation's grain.
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have rallied almost daily for three
months in support of Milosevic's effort to assert more authority in
the provinces.
   Most demonstrations have supported the cause of Serbs in Kosovo.
A largely Christian minority, they claim harassment by
predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million people. The southern province borders on Albania.
   The latest protesters sang Serbian nationalist songs but also
shouted complaints about low wages and declining standards of
living. State television said an informal poll it conducted of
demonstrators in Novi Sad showed that most cited the bad economic
situation as the main reason for demanding change.
   Milosevic rejected a call Thursday from former Defense Minister
Nikola Ljubicic, who is a member of the nation's collective
presidency, for unspecified emergency measures to quell the street
protests.
   The Serbian leader's opponents suspect he is using the mass
rallies to gain more national power for himself and for Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Many Serbs see Milosevic as political heir to the late President
Josip Broz Tito, who died in 1980 and left the nation with a
complex system of annual rotation in the occupants of top political
offices.
   The arrangement has prevented any one republic from gaining
dominance, but it has not provided the strong leadership needed to
deal effectively with ethnic and economic problems. Strikes and
worker protests have become commonplace because of 217 percent
annual inflation, 15 percent unemployment and austerity plans
imposed to try to repay a $21 billion foreign debt.
   The failure of the federal Communist government, led by Premier
Branko Mikulic, to cope with the economic crisis triggered an
attempt to unseat him in May with a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence. Mikulic staved off the effort with support from
Serbian deputies.

   Two suburban Minneapolis children were killed
by automatic garage doors in separate accidents the same day, and
authorities say the devices probably did not meet current safety
standards due to their age.
   ``We're interested in finding out who manufactured those
devices, who installed them and how they were maintained,'' said
Dennis Donath, an investigator for the U.S. Consumer Products
Safety Commission.
   Both victims, Daniel Louis Tracy, 10, and Abigael J. Henry, 9,
were asphyxiated by pressure of the doors against their chests,
according to autopsy reports. Both died Wednesday before relatives
discovered them.
   Officials believe the children were operating the devices by
themselves when they were caught by the closing doors. Both devices
were at least 10 years old, officials said.
   Daniel apparently was knocked off his bicycle by the door on his
parents' garage and pinned to the ground. The door caught him on
his chin, said Sgt. Bill Lunzer of the Roseville Police Department.
   Abigael was probably running out to meet her 5-year-old sister,
Molly, at a bus stop, authorities said. Molly found her sister
pinned under the garage door of their Eden Prairie home.
   Federal authorities have documented 32 garage-door deaths of
children under age 12 since voluntary safety standards for the
automatic openers were last upgraded in 1982, Donath said. The last
known garage-door death occurred in 1980.
   ``A lot of the early (models) with the reversible feature never
did work properly,'' said Brian Beckman, owner of Northern Door Co.
in Maplewood.
   He recommended that homeowners test their automatic garage doors
simply by trying to stop them by hand. If one does not stop or
reverse, he recommended installing a new unit.

<TEXT>
   A new state law requiring unmarried
minors to obtain parental consent for abortions was put on hold by
a federal judge who ruled that the measure fell ``woefully short''
of constitutional requirements.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore said the preliminary
injunction he issued Thursday would stand until ``further order of
the court.''
   It prevents Gov. Bob Martinez, Attorney General Bob Butterworth
and state attorneys from enforcing the law, which requires
unmarried teens under 18 to seek the consent of a parent, custodian
or legal guardian before obtaining an abortion.
   If parents refused to give consent, a pregnant teen-ager could
appeal to a judge, who would decide if the girl was mature enough
to make the decision and whether an abortion was in her best
interest.
   Moore's ruling ``means that the young women of Florida can do
what they want with their bodies and exercise their constitutional
right to have an abortion,'' said attorney William J. Sheppard, who
represented a women's clinic and three physicians who challenged
the law.
   Penny Gardner, president of the Dade County chapter of the
National Organization for Women, called the ruling ``a wonderful
victory.''
   ``The state Legislature was particularly thoughtless in passing
that bill, and they responded to the anti-choice people without
really considering what it really meant to the women of this
state,'' she said.
   But Carole Griffin, a Tallahassee anti-abortion lobbyist, said,
``Even parents who are adamantly pro-abortion want to be involved
with their minor daughter's decision.'' She said she expects the
injunction to be overturned. The order followed arguments in a
90-minute hearing Wednesday that the law unconstitutionally
restricts access to abortion for pregnant girls under 18.
   Sheppard argued that ``the statute unduly burdens a minor's
right to abortion by failing to adequately prescribe procedures for
ensuring the confidentiality and anonymity of minors, and that it
fails to establish sufficient guidelines for an expeditious appeal
of a Circuit Court decision.''
   Assistant Attorney General George Waas argued the law is
constitutional and said legislation is not required to address
``all variables in the vast expanse of human experience.''
   Moore pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a
woman's constitutional right to an abortion and that the right had
been extended to minors.
   Moore said said the law, ``when measured against Supreme Court
precedent ... falls woefully short of constitutional requirements.''

Infestation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Overnight aerial spraying to kill a
Mediterranean fruit fly infestation left much of the city's West
Side looking like Christo artwork, as residents wrapped cars,
playground equipment and other belongings in plastic.
   Pesticide-laden helicopters criss-crossed a 35-square-mile area
until early today in the first step of an all-out attack against
the Medfly, an agricultural pest that destroys about 250 varieties
of produce.
   The insecticide Malathion poses no health risk, agriculture
officials said, but they warned residents that the sticky corn
syrup in which it was mixed to attract the flies could damage a
car's paint.
   The alert prompted a run on tarpaulins and plastic wrap at
stores throughout the area.
   ``People say a lot of chain stores are out of the stuff,'' said
Allan Goldman of Culver City Hardware.
   The effect of the protective measures was especially striking at
the Los Angeles County Art Museum, where outdoor sculptures swathed
in black plastic and tape recalled fences and bridges transformed
into artworks through similar wrapping by Christo, the
Bulgarian-born artist.
   The spraying was ordered because 47 Medflies were found in the
Palms area since Sept. 26, agricultural officials said.
   But aerial spraying was only the first step in the three-part
attack against the pest, said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the
California Department of Food and Agriculture.
   A quarantine against transporting fruit and vegetables from the
area is expected to go into effect today or Monday, she said.
   The final step will be the release of millions of sterile
Medflies later this month so that the wild Medflies that survived
the spraying will, in effect, breed themselves out of existence.
   Although agricultural production in the urbanized area is
slight, officials termed the infestation serious, saying it would
threaten the state's $15.5 billion-a-year farm economy if allowed
to spread.
   Along with parts of Beverly Hills, the helicopters sprayed
sections of west Los Angeles and the adjacent municipalities of
Culver City and West Hollywood.
   About 100,000 people live in the sprayed area, which includes
middle-class homes and apartments, multimillion-dollar mansions,
swank shops and luxury car dealerships.
   For much of the day, Ms. Curry said, worried residents flooded
hot lines set up by agriculture officials with questions about the
spraying.
   At Paulee Body Shop, president Ken Fleiner assigned four
employees to cover more than 180 mostly high-priced automobiles
parked outdoors. Fleiner said he spent about $500 on plastic and
$200 on masking tape for the job, which took hours.
   At Martin Cadillac in West Los Angeles, a caravan of about 100
shiny Caddies left the sales lot Wednesday night for an underground
parking lot at a bank building six blocks away, sales manager Steve
Mitchell said Thursday.

New England and upstate New York.
   Temperatures remained in the 70s and lower 80s this morning in
the Gulf Coast region and the deserts of the Southwest.
   Rain developed in the central United States and continued from
Arkansas to northwest Texas today.
   In the Southwest, thunderstorms developed, and one of them
spawned a tornado near Tonopah, Nev., Thursday afternoon, but the
thunderstorms dissipated during the evening. By this morning only
widely scattered light showers remained.
   A few showers and thunderstorms continued in southern Florida,
and widely scattered showers and thunderstorms lingered along the
southern Atlantic Coast and in the lower Great Lakes region.
   Fair skies prevailed across the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Two American human rights groups
claimed today that Filipino soldiers may be linked to the killings
of five human rights lawyers and the harassment of a dozen others
since last year.
   A report by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and Asia
Watch, both New York-based groups, claimed President Corazon
Aquino's government ``has failed to respond adequately'' to attacks
on human rights lawyers and that victims of abuses were afraid to
seek legal redress.
   The 28-page report cited the unsolved killings of five human
rights lawyers, who were slain in separate incidents from October
1987 until last June.
   It said evidence existed that the military or military-backed
anti-Communist vigilante groups may have been involved in the
killings.
   The report by the two groups said more than a dozen other
lawyers have been subjected to threats, harassment and surveillance
since 1987.
   It urged the Aquino government to ``publicly and unambiguously
express its commitment to the protection of human rights lawyers
and its condemnation of the killings, threats and harassment.''
   ``Victims of abuses are often afraid to pursue legal redress,''
said the report, written by Norman Dorsen, professor of law at New
York University, and Nadine Strossen, visiting professor of law at
New York Law School.
   ``Those who do, often discover that those responsible are
shielded from prosecution by the local military detachment,'' the
report said.
   There was no comment from the government on the charges.
   Mrs. Aquino has vowed to curb human rights abuses. But last
month, she said it was unfair to blame the entire military
establishment for abuses by a few of its members.
   The report was released two days after the London-based Amnesty
International human rights organization claimed more than 100
leftists, trade unionists and social activists were slain in the
Philippines last year because of alleged links to Communist rebels.
   Human rights groups here claim such abuses are continuing
despite Mrs. Aquino's pledge to protect civil liberties after the
1986 ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos.
   During a human rights seminar here Thursday, military officials
and civil rights workers clashed over the government's plans to
deploy a new civilian militia, the Citizens' Armed Forces
Geographical Unit, to help battle the rebels.
   Undersecretary of Defense Eduardo Ermita said the 160,000-member
armed forces alone could not contend with the 25,000-strong New
People's Army, Moslem insurgents and right-wing extremists. He said
members of the new force would be carefully screened and would face
court-martial for any human rights abuses.
   But Mariss Diokno, a prominent human rights activist, said the
new force was ``anti-democratic'' and a step toward militarization
that social activists hoped would be reversed following Marcos'
ouster.

   Foreign nations are shunning Burma's
three-week-old military government that has cracked down on a
popular uprising for democracy, diplomats said today.
   The main official contacts have involved notes from several
foreign embassies decrying the bloodshed since Gen. Saw Maung
seized power in a coup.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no
nation has sent the standard message of congratulations to the new
leader, which would signify recognition of his government.
Diplomats also said Saw Maung, who also serves as the new foreign
minister, has met no heads of foreign missions.
   Ambassadors of the European Community and Japan last month
presented protest notes citing the killing of unarmed civilians by
troops. Other countries, including the United States, have
expressed concern from their capitals.
   Meanwhile, state radio reported Thursday that two more
opposition groups have registered with the government, bringing to
seven the number of opposition parties that have surfaced since Saw
Maung seized power.
   The newest parties to register with the election commission were
the Unity and Development Party, led by former communist rebel
Thakin Soe, and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, headed by
onetime member of parliament Bo Kya Nyunt.
   Thakin Soe, 80, once led the Red Flag communist rebels who
followed a radical, Trotskyite program but were defeated by the
Burmese military in the 1960s. The People's Democratic Party, which
registered earlier, also is headed by a former communist figure.
   The new military government, which seized power in Sept. 18,
crushed pro-democracy demonstrations but announced that multi-party
elections would be held in about three months.
   Although seven parties have registered with the commission, none
have stated clearly whether they would take part in the elections,
which also will be contested by the government's National Unity
Party.
   Diplomats and other analysts are skeptical that fair elections
can be held given a hardline government that has been willing to
shoot thousands of unarmed demonstrators to stay in power.
   By official count, about 440 people have been killed since the
military coup. Western diplomats here believe the death toll is
much higher.
   Other anti-government groups are the Democracy Party, the
People's Youth Federation, the All Burma United Youths Organization
and the National League for Democracy.
   The patron of an eighth anti-government group _ the League for
Democracy _ is Nu, the former prime minister overthrown by
strongman Ne Win in 1962.
   Western diplomats say they are convinced the National Unity
Party is fully supported by Saw Maung and his military government,
but that the new leaders want their actions to appear legal so as
to subdue strong anti-government feelings among the public.
   Since last fall, Burma has been wracked by bloody protests and a
deteriorating economy. Demonstrators have called for the end of
authoritarian rule and a liberalized economy to pull one of Asia's
most resource-rich nations out of poverty.
   Japan, West Germany and the United States have temporarily
frozen aid to Burma but have refrained from direct interference in
the domestic turmoil.
   In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry announced today Japan would
provide Burma with $450,000 in emergency food aid through UNICEF
because of serious shortages.
   But Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno stressed at a news conference
that ``This doesn't mean we approve of Saw Maung's military
government.''

   Radical students calling for the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo hurled hundreds of firebombs and
rocks at riot police today during a violent demonstration at a
Seoul college.
   In another demonstration in the southern city of Kwangju, about
300 students clashed with riot troopers and 12 troopers were
injured, the Yonhap news agency reported.
   Police reported no arrests or serious injuries during the
90-minute clash in Seoul, the largest in the capital in recent
weeks.
   Some 2,000 students from about 30 colleges took part in the
rally on the outskirts of southern Seoul to denounce the Roh
administration and call for the expulsion of U.S. forces based in
South Korea.
   ``Down with the fascist regime which suppresses the masses,''
the students chanted. ``Yankee go home.''
   The leaders charged that the Roh administration was a front for
military rule and insisted there had been no democratic reforms in
South Korea.
   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections in
December, has helped introduce broad democratic reforms since
taking power. He has pledged to end authoritarian rule and make
South Korea a full democracy.
   The students marched out of the school and clashed on the
highway outside with hundreds of riot police. Police armored vans
with multiple tear gas launchers fired barrages of tear gas
canisters.
   The two-hour riot in Kwangju took place at the Chonam
University, Yonhap reported. The South Korean agency said the 12
troopers were injured by firebombs and rocks.
   The radicals have virtually no public support and their
following on campuses has dwindled sharply in recent months. They
staged a few protests during the Olympic Games which ended Sunday,
but generally were quiet.

   Five nuns remained barricaded today
in their monastery, fighting a church relocation order prompted by
their objection to the introduction of such modern amenities as
television and music systems.
   Fearing they would be evicted from the monastery because their
conservative views clashed with the new wave of liberalization,
four nuns locked themselves in the infirmary of the Monastery of
the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt. Carmel on Tuesday. A fifth nun
joined them Wednesday.
   The nuns are members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites. They
say the first intrusion began just over a year ago when a new
prioress brought in a television set.
   Other trappings of the outside world slowly found their way
behind the white walls of the monastery: music systems, sweets and
a modern lighting system in the chapel.
   ``It just became a gradual breakdown (of traditions),'' said
Sister John of the Cross.
   ``These sisters are keeping a vigil, they are not protesting,''
Doreen Ercolano, the sibling of one of the nuns, Sister Maria, said
Thursday.
   ``They are fearful that if they leave the infirmary they'll be
physically forced from the monastery.''
   Sister Eliane, who has been at the monastery the longest time
among the 13 nuns, said the dispute is a ``conservative-liberal
issue.''
   ``They do not agree with some changes made here,'' she said.
``They are scared to death.''
   Tim Manning, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Paterson, said there are no plans to physically evict the nuns, but
the church will try to talk them into ending the protest.
   The conservative nuns say the diocese threatened to evict them
from the monastery because of their adherence to their religious
order.
   ``We were told we are too strict,'' Sister John said Thursday in
a telephone interview from the monastery's locked infirmary. ``We
were always encouraged to be conservative. But in the last year
every aspect of our lives has changed.''
   The Carmelite order was founded in 1562 by St. Teresa Avila of
Spain. Its followers try to remove all intrusions of modern life
and dedicate themselves to contemplation and prayer. Although there
is no vow of silence, the order is expected to keep speech to a
minimum.
   The Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt. Carmel was
built in 1926 when this community 30 miles west of New York City
was remote and rural. Today, the Spanish architecture stands in
contrast to a suburban backdrop of gleaming office buildings and
service stations.
   The dispute began with the arrival of a new prioress, Mother
Teresa Hewitt, who brought television, music and other modern
conveniences to the monastery, angering the more conservative nuns
who complained to the Vatican.
   Mother Hewitt refused comment Thursday. Vatican officials in
Washington did not return telephone calls.
   The church had tried to settle the matter by offering to move
the more conservative Carmelite nuns to another monastery. But the
conservative nuns refused to move.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino visited one
of the country's most historic shrines today to decide whether to
allow an American firm continue a controversial treasure hunt there.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she was ``very pleased'' with the
restoration of chambers unearthed by nearly a year of digging at
Fort Santiago, a 16th Century Spanish fortress used by Japanese
troops as a concentration camp for American and Filipino prisoners
during World War II.
   She added that she and her staff need more time to determine
whether to renew for a third time the digging permit given the firm
International Precious Metals, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nev.
   The firm's head, Charles McDougal, and Emanuel Soriano, Mrs.
Aquino's chief security adviser, insist that tons of gold bullion
are buried beneath the fort. They claim core drillings have yielded
gold particles.
   The digging has been dogged by controversy since shortly after
it began secretly in November. The treasure hunt became public in
February when two Filipino workers were killed in a cave-in.
   Last month, the government's anti-graft prosecutor accused
Soriano of accepting payments from the company. Soriano admitted he
deposited a total $110,000 of company funds in his personal bank
account but claimed it was simply entrusted to him pending a
company reorganization.
   Soriano said the funds included $40,000 as a guarantee against
damages to the fort, built by Spanish colonialists at the mouth of
the Pasig River to defend the city.
   Fort Santiago served as prison to Jose Rizal, the Philippines's
national hero who was executed in 1896, and was converted into a
concentration camp and torture center by Japanese soldiers during
World War II.
   Soriano and McDougal told Mrs. Aquino they had maps and at least
two witnesses who have showed them the places where the Japanese
imperial army officers buried tons of gold, silver, diamonds and
other treasures plundered by the Japanese from all over Southeast
Asia.
   Asked by reporters if she was going to renew the permit to dig,
which expired on Sept. 1, Mrs. Aquino replied she was more
interested in the restoration work on the newly unearthed portions
of the fort.
   ``We have not given any extension of the permit yet,'' she
added. ``We are still evaluating all of the different reports that
we have been getting ... so that we can evaluate later on whether
we will grant an extension or not.''

   A Japanese cargo ship sank after it collided with a
South Korean container vessel during a typhoon today, killing the
captain of the cargo vessel, a coast guard official said. Another
person was reported missing.
   Three crew members of the 199-ton Japanese Kannon-maru were
thrown into the sea when their ship collided with the 4,252-ton
South Korean Aurora in Ise Bay about 170 miles southwest of Tokyo,
the official said on condition of anonymity.
   Two of the crewmen were pulled from the sea, but Capt. Tatsuo
Nishibe died in a hospital after he was rescued. Patrol boats and a
helicopter were looking for a missing Japanese crewman, Itaru Chaya.
   Hiromi Hamada, vice captain of the Japanese ship, was injured in
the collision, the official added. No injuries were reported among
the 20 Aurora crew members.
   The Kannon-maru, carrying scrap iron, was heading west and the
Aurora was moving south when they collided in rough seas, the coast
guard official said. But he said visibility was mostly clear at the
time.
   The South Korean cargo vessel, which was damaged on the right
bow, was escorted into Toba port.

<HEAD>Editorial Reactions on Bentsen-Quayle Debate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Following is a roundup of editorial reaction to the vice
presidential debate from newspapers around the country:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Sen. Lloyd Bentsen accomplished three tasks with the most
memorable line of Wednesday night's vice-presidential debate, when
he told J. Danforth Quayle, `Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.' With
that remark, he helped establish himself as by far the better of
the two candidates _ and in a close presidential election, he may
have given many Reagan Democrats as good a reason as they need to
come back to the fold next month.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``If (Quayle) had only one decent answer to the question he
faced at least three times _ the one about what he would do if a
tragedy thrust him into the presidency _ we would have been more
reassured. But obviously he either hadn't anticipated the question
or didn't want to answer it. ...
   ``He would say a prayer for himself and the country. Good. He
would call together the Cabinet. Good. But then what? Sen. Quayle
prefered to talk about his qualifications rather than give us a
clue that he had a thoughtful plan in mind.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Star Tribune (Minneapolis)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The `debate' seemed to confirm the awfulness of George Bush's
decision to choose Dan Quayle as running mate. Michael Dukakis'
choice looked better; (Lloyd) Bentsen was more polished, more
experienced, more adept at ripostes like his now-famous slashing of
Quayle's self-comparison with John Kennedy. But the erratic
proceedings Wednesday night offered little basis for solid
comparison. It was an opportunity wasted.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Atlanta Constitution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Nothing in Mr. Quayle's performance provided reassurance that
he is ready to stand on the verge of the presidency or that Mr.
Bush acted with then-unrecognized wisdom in selecting him. ...
   ``Mr. Bentsen _ no surprise _ was the cooler, cannier head, in
part simply because of his greater experience.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Arkansas Gazette (Little Rock)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Quayle, in our view, was mechanical in his responses to the
panel's questions, reverting on several occasions to the same
phraseology about his qualifications regardless of the question
asked _ a reflection of briefings and rehearsals. ...
   ``Bentsen presented a mature and thoughtful figure, drawing a
sharp contrast with Quayle on relative leadership qualities and
experience. Relative ages may have been a factor, perhaps depending
upon the viewer's generation, but Bentsen's broader experience
clearly testified to his benefit.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Wednesday's vice presidential debate won't be remembered for
exchanges about Social Security, farm subsidies or foreign policy.
   ``The debate turned on one question: is J. Danforth Quayle III
qualified to be president should anything happen to George Bush?
Three times, Indiana's junior senator was asked how he would handle
such a crisis. Three times, he faltered.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dallas Times Herald:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Sen. Quayle stood up fairly well to some tough, maybe even
unfair questioning. He did not fall on his face, as some pundits
had expected, but he never gave a satisfactory answer to three
questions about what he would do first if he became president. But
at the same time, Sen. Bentsen proved that he not only is a
knowledgeable, articulate officeholder who has a solid record of
achievement, but that he can be awfully tough in the clutch.''

   The widow of acting teacher Lee Strasberg
threatened to sue if a love letter from Marilyn Monroe to Monroe's
one-time husband Joe DiMaggio is sold at auction.
   The letter, written a few weeks before Monroe's death, surfaced
last week and is now at the Swann Gallery here, where it is
scheduled to be auctioned on Oct. 25.
   But Anna Strasberg claims she is entitled to the letter, arguing
that all personal items Monroe left were willed to her husband,
Lee, of whose estate she is executor, the Daily News reported in
today's editions.
   The letter, originally discovered by a housekeeper in a desk in
Monroe's home the day after she was found dead on Aug. 5, 1962,
reads:
   ``Dear Joe, If I can succeed in making you happy, I will have
succeeded in the biggest and most difficult thing there is, that is
to make one person completely happy. Your happiness means my
happiness.''
   George Lowery of the Swann Gallery said the letter, which is
signed NJ for Norma Jean _ Monroe's real name, carries a minimum
asking price of $10,000.
   Strasberg, an Austrian-born theatrical director, established the
Lee Strasberg Institute of Theater in New York and Los Angeles. He
died in 1982.

   Here are the latest developments involving foreign hostages held
in Lebanon.
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanese kidnappers warned that two American
hostages may be in danger if proposals to send U.N. troops into
Lebanon to oversee presidential elections are carried out.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization made the threat in a
statement issued Thursday. The group claims to hold Joseph James
Cicippio of Norristown, Pa. and Edward Austin Tracy, of Burlington,
Vt.
   The statement, typewritten in Arabic and delivered to the
independent newspaper An-Nahar, was accompanied by a Polaroid
photograph of Cicippio.
   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University of
Beirut when he was kidnapped on the school's campus on Sept. 12,
1986. Tracy, 57, an author, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986 in Moslem
west Beirut.

<TEXT>
   JERUSALEM _ An Israeli newspaper reported today that the United
States struck a deal with Iran to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon,
including the supply of arms and spare parts to Tehran through
South Korea.
   The unattributed report in The Nation, a new English-language
weekly, said the U.S. government agreed to pay $7 million in ransom
to the Lebanese Shiite Moslem extremists holding the hostages but
refused the group's demands for immunity from prosecution.
   The report said the U.S. refusal to guarantee immunity angered
the kidnappers and prompted them to release Mithileshwar Singh, an
Indian, instead of Alann Steen, a U.S. citizen whose release had
been expected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State George P. Shultz sharply
denied reports that Washington is secretly negotiating with Iran
for release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   Shultz told reporters Thursday that anyone who claims to be a
U.S. envoy to such negotiations is lying. He gave no specifics
about individuals who ``nominate themselves'' as government
representatives but suggested the practice is widespread.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati denied categorically
at a separate news conference that the United States and Iran had
opened talks on hostages or any other subjects.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ A Beirut newspaper reported today that
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, missing in Lebanon for more than
20 months, will be freed in 72 hours.
   The conservative daily Al-Anwar, based in Christian east Beirut,
cited unidentified sources. The newspaper has no record of
authoritative reports on the hostage issue, and there was no way to
confirm the report.
   It said one of its sources reported that Waite was moved from
the eastern Bekaa Valley to Beirut's southern suburbs. But another
source, it said, claimed Waite, 48, will be freed after resumption
of British-Syrian relations.

   WIESBADEN, West Germany _ A team of U.S. experts interviewing
freed hostage Mithileshwar Singh has gleaned information about the
conditions of other Americans still held in Lebanon, a U.S.
official said.
   Singh asked not to meet with the news media, officials said
today. Singh has undergone medical checks and debriefings at the
U.S. Air Force hospital in Weisbaden. He was freed Monday after 20
months in captivity.
   Singh was held with Jesse Turner, 41, a native of Boise, Idaho;
Alann Steen, 49, of Boston; and Robert Polhill, 54, of New York
City. All four taught at Beirut University College.

   Saying it might improve discipline in the city's
public schools, Mayor Edward I. Koch has arranged for a clothing
manufacturer to donate student uniforms as a tryout.
   Koch said he wants to try putting public school students in
uniforms ``comparable to the dress codes in parochial or private
schools with the thought that it might help in the learning process
to have that kind of discipline.''
   The mayor said Thursday that he has asked schools Chancellor
Richard R. Green to pick a school of about 400 students and send
their measurements to the manufacturer, who was not identified.
   An aide to Green said the chancellor would try to locate an
elementary school where the principal and parents would be willing
to participate.
   Robert Wagner Jr., president of the Board of Education,
expressed skepticism at the suggestion, but said he was willing to
give it a try.
   The mayor disclosed the plan at a park restoration project in
Queens.
   ``I don't tell you that just jackets and skirts and pants that
match the jackets is a solution to our education problem, but I
believe that there are lots of things that have to be done,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Officials Say Radon Levels In Clinton Home Are Highest Ever Found</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tests on a home that had radon
levels about 800 times higher than the federal safety standard have
failed to convince some neighbors that the colorless, odorless gas
could kill them, officials said.
   The test last week on an unidentified home may be the highest
radon levels ever measured in a structure.
   ``We believe it's the highest that anyone's ever found,'' said
Christopher Daggett, acting commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Protection.
   Officials said that 59 of the 74 other nearby homes in the rural
community about 40 miles west of New York City also showed unsafe
radon levels.
   Many homes that have registered high radon readings sit above
the Reading Prong, a belt of uranium that stretches from
Pennsylvania across northeastern New Jersey into New York.
   The federal standard for structures is 4 picocuries, a unit of
measurement for radioactivity.
   Federal officials say exposure to high levels of the naturally
occurring gas may cause up to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year _
essentially all those not caused from smoking.
   John Van Nuys, an investigator for the Hunterdon County Health
Department, spent the weekend knocking on doors in the sprawling
development, urging residents to place charcoal-filled canisters in
their basements for testing.
   He said he met with some distrustful and suspicious residents _
and several slammed doors.
   Some were only convinced of the urgency because it was important
enough to get a government employee working on a Saturday.
   When a sampling of residents were told Thursday of the state's
findings, some said they didn't know much about radon, some said
they didn't care much, and some said they didn't care to talk about
the levels found in their homes.
   Others said they have had their homes tested or are awaiting
test results.
   Officials said that although a radon test only costs about $10,
and a high level is easily cured with a ventilation system for
about $1,200, apathy is the biggest challenge in fighting the
health problem.
   They also say that many residents may ignore warnings because
they have grown immune to the constant stream of warnings about
environmental problems.
   The announcement about the Clinton Township home comes about two
years after state officials discovered 105 houses with elevated
radon levels in a nearby development.
   Daggett said the barrage of testing here began after a homeowner
did a routine radon test and found a reading of about 200
picocuries. The department confirmed the results and began testing
other homes.
   Daggett said the home with the highest reading registered more
than 3,000 picocuries.
   The federal safety standard of 4 picocuries is the equivalent of
smoking one-half pack of cigarettes a day, or having 200 to 300
chest X-rays per year. It also is the concentration that would
increase the chance of getting lung cancer by 1 percent for a
lifetime resident.

   Federal health officials have reported the first
case of AIDS acquired from a transplant operation, but researchers
stressed that the operation was four years ago _ before the advent
of AIDS testing.
   Transplant patients have previously been infected with the virus
that causes AIDS, but Thursday's report from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control marked the first time AIDS virus has been
associated with a bone transplant, and the first case ever reported
in which any kind of transplant has resulted in AIDS itself.
   ``This is consistent with how we have found the virus to be
transmitted previously _ in blood, bodily fluids and body parts
from another individual. ... It's an expected mode of
transmission,'' said Dr. John Ward, an AIDS specialist with the
Atlanta-based CDC.
   Ward noted that the surgery in question took place before the
advent of antibody testing for AIDS; the donor was an intravenous
drug user infected with AIDS.
   ``It's important for the lay public to understand that this case
occurred in 1984. ... The donor could not be screened,'' he said.
   Since then, AIDS tests have become available, and the Public
Health Service has recommended that all donors of tissue or organs
be tested for AIDS infection.
   This first AIDS-transplant case occurred in a woman with
progressive spinal disease who, in November 1984, underwent a
spinal fusion using bone from her hospital's bone bank. In February
1988, she was diagnosed with AIDS. She was a health care worker,
but there were no indications she had contracted an AIDS infection
on the job, the CDC reported.
   The donor from whom the bone came, a 52-year-old man who had
undergone a partial hip bone removal, turned out to be an
intravenous drug user, and thus at high risk for AIDS. He was
diagnosed with AIDS less than two years after the woman's surgery
and died in 1987.
   The Public Health Service, the CDC's parent agency, recommended
Thursday that living donors of bone be tested for AIDS at the time
the bone is removed, and then again 90 days later to ensure that
any AIDS infection is detected.
   More than 74,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States, with more than 42,000 deaths so far, according to the CDC.
   Some 24 cases of AIDS virus transmission through transplants
have been reported worldwide, in cases such as kidney, liver and
heart transplants, Ward said. None of those patients has been
diagnosed with AIDS itself, but ``undoubtedly, some will develop
AIDS in the future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Robin Williams Files Suit Against Ex-Lover</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Robin Williams says an ex-lover
who claims he gave her herpes has used ``duress, coercion and
fraud'' since 1985 in an effort to extort money from him.
   Williams filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court
Thursday against Michelle Tish Carter of Los Angeles.
   In 1986, Carter filed a $6 million suit against Williams in
Stanislaus County that has since been moved to San Francisco.
   The comedian's suit contends that in November 1985 Carter told
Williams she had contracted herpes, a sexually transmitted disease.
Two medical tests proved negative, the suit said.
   Williams tried to break off the relationship but Carter
``claimed she was pregnant by Williams and demanded $20,000 and a
new car,'' the complaint charged.
   The suit charged Carter with extortion, conspiracy and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. It seeks an
unspecified amount in damages.
   ``Carter intentionally and with extraordinary malice, made these
representations to Williams, threatening damage to his public
persona and damage to his family life in order to extort money and
property from him,'' the suit said.
   Carter's attorney, Adolph B. Canelo, was out of the country and
could not be reached for comment.

   President Reagan, campaigning for George Bush in
a key campaign battleground state, told Michigan high school
students today that this year's election is ``a referendum on
liberalism in America.''
   In a speech prepared for students and citizens of suburban
Sterling Heights, Reagan urged every eligible voter to take part in
the Nov. 8 election.
   ``Michigan has voted twice for what we stand for,'' he said.
``But the liberals are now saying that, come January, they will
wipe away all that we have beeen working for.''
   ``From top to bottom, the election this year is a referendum on
liberalism,'' said Reagan, who is Republican presidential candidate
George Bush's best-known campaign surrogate.
   ``Will not only the White House but the Congress and the state
legislatures be filled with people whose only Pledge of Allegiance
is to more government spending?'' he asked.
   Reagan flew to Detroit to hammer away at the GOP theme of
``peace and prosperity'' at a school named for the late Adlai
Stevenson, a prominent Democrat and two-time presidential campaign
loser.
   The trip was part of a series Reagan is making as he seeks to
lure ``Reagan Democrats'' and independent voters to Bush's side in
the vice president's race against Massachusetts Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   It also was a homecoming of sorts, since it was in Detroit's Joe
Louis Arena that Reagan in July 1980 accepted his party's
nomination for the first time to be its presidential candidate _
and chose Bush to be his running mate.
   Most experts rate Michigan a tossup between Bush and Dukakis.
Reagan felt so strongly about carrying the state during his
re-election campaign in 1984 that he appeared twice in the last
week of the campaign. The president's last appearance in Michigan
was in September 1986, when he campaigned for Bill Lucas, a
Republican who failed in his bid to become governor of Michigan.
   Reagan also was speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Michigan
State Chamber of Commerce and the Michigan chapter of the National
Federation of Independent Business in the northeastern Detroit
suburb of Macomb County.
   His appearance there comes just a week after Bush's visit to
Macomb Community College. Political experts in Michigan say both
stops are part of an organized effort to win over that area's
blue-collar Democrats who crossed party lines to support the
president in 1980 and 1984.
   Reagan in recent weeks has been fond of telling campaign
audiences that Democrats abandoned the so-called ``misery index''
when that party found that inflation and interest rates had
declined during his administration.
   While Reagan seeks to help Bush broaden his electoral appeal to
conservative Democrats and people who do not describe themselves as
either Democrats or Republicans, the president has been raising
millions of dollars for state GOP campaign coffers.
   Reagan was sure to repeat this act with tonight's appearance at
a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser for the state party and in honor of
Max Fisher, a prominent Detroit-area GOP supporter.

   Two public opinion polls published today showed
a tie between the dovish Labor Party and the hard-line Likud bloc,
and the two rivals swapped accusations in a series of television
advertisements.
   Results of those questioned in the two polls showed Labor and
Likud would win 42 seats each in the 120-member parliament if the
Nov. 1 election were held today. The results were published in the
Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
   The 1984 elections ended in a stalemate with neither of the
major political blocs able to form a coalition. The result was
shared rule in a national unity government with Labor leader Shimon
Peres and Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir each serving two years as
premier.
   The Likud-sponsored Dahaf poll predicted Likud and its
right-wing allies would win 60 seats in the Knesset, while Labor
and the left secured an equal number.
   The Labor-sponsored Decima poll said Labor and the leftist lists
would gain a narrow majority of 61 seats.
   The Dahaf poll questioned 662 voters, and the Decima poll
encompassed 1,000 voters. The paper did not disclose the margin of
error given, and the offices of both pollsters were closed for the
Jewish Sabbath.
   Also today, American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane appealed to Israel's
Supreme Court requesting it overturn a Central Elections Committee
decision to disqualify his anti-Arab party from running in the
elections.
   The parliamentary committee barred Kahane's Kach Party from
participating in the elections, saying its platform calling for all
Arabs to be expelled from Israel is racist. A new law bars racist
parties from running for government.
   In a third day of televised ads that will continue nightly until
the Nov. 1 vote, the barbed repartee between Labor and Likud came
as close to a televised debate as the campaign has seen so far.
   ``No one in this country is against peace,'' said Benyamin
Netanyahu, the former U.N. ambassador and a rising star in Likud.
``But what Labor wants is peace through retreat (from the occupied
territories).''
   He was referring to Peres' willingness to talk peace with the
Palestinians, even though Labor refuses to negotiate with the
banned Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Immediately after the Likud segment ended, Labor's Nissim Zvili
appeared on the screen.
   ``So, you're scared, huh? They scared the heck out of us, didn't
they,'' Zvili said. ``That's the Likud system: frightening people,
making personal attacks, and frightening again.''
   Labor has outlined the ``generals' peace plan'' it is pushing,
so-called because it was developed with the help of high-ranking
officers in Israel's reserve army.
   The plan calls for withdrawing from certain undefined areas of
the occupied territories, but demanding those territories remain
demilitarized in order to guarantee safe borders.
   Israel expanded its borders in the 1967 Middle East war when it
captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
   Shamir has pledged never to return to the pre-1967 borders.
   The nearly 10-month-old Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule
is the top issue in the tight election campaign.
   More than 280 Arabs and six Israelis have been killed in the
violence, which erupted Dec. 8.
   Both parties oppose creation of an independent Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Planned Oliver North Lecture Sparks Controversy at Boston College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Boston College students are
circulating a petition opposing a student government decision to
pay retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North $25,000 to lecture there,
saying he isn't worth it.
   Those behind the petition say the fee is too high and North will
not trigger discussion worth the price.
   David McAuley, executive vice president of the student
government board, defended the selection, calling North one of the
most popular figures of the decade. He said the 90-minute lecture
Nov. 2 will attract a broad range of students.
   ``Overall, this is a great opportunity to listen to a man
responsible for one of the great shake-ups in our government's
history,'' McAuley told The Boston Globe.
   Jean Graham, editor-in-chief of The Heights, the independent
student weekly newspaper at the university, said, ``It doesn't seem
like they (the student board) took the opposition to heart. I think
they brought him because he would be controversial and would draw a
lot of people. But they may lose more people than they draw.''
   She wrote an editorial against the choice and said a group of
students is gathering signatures to try to block North's appearance.
   ``For $18,000, I was told, we could have had Jimmy Carter, and
he's a former president,'' she said. ``I don't think we can learn
that much from Oliver North.''
   North faces trial on 16 charges of conspiracy to defraud the
government in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages plan. He has given
more than 25 speeches in the past year to raise money for his
defense.
   Last year, former Democratic Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado and
former U.S. Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork lectured at the
college for a combined charge of less than $30,000, said Douglas J.
Whiting, director of communications for the college.
   The money for the appearance comes from a student activities
fund created through a mandatory student assessment fee, Whiting
said. He said that in the past the fund had been used for several
lectures, but this year the board voted to spend most of it for
North's appearance.

<HEAD>Lithuania Agrees to Activists' Demands on Flag, Language</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of public protests, the Lithuanian
legislature has agreed to make Lithuanian the Baltic republic's
official language and to permit display of religious symbols, an
activist reported today.
   The decision prompted an estimated 100,000 Lithuanians, mostly
Roman Catholics, to gather in their capital, Vilnius, this morning
to celebrate with nationalist songs, flag-waving and dancing, said
activist Vytautas Bogusis.
   Also today, Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that
the legislature of Latvia, another Baltic republic, was drafting a
bill to make Latvian the republic's official language.
   Similar measures were adopted earlier in the third Baltic
republic, Estonia, in response to a campaign by nationalists.
   Bogusis, a member of the Lithuanian Freedom League, a group
demanding an end to Soviet control over their republic, said local
newspapers today reprinted decrees of the Presidium, or executive
committee of the legislature. One measure allows display of
religious symbols, and another designates Lithuanian the republic's
official language.
   Many Baltic activists complain that top officials in their
republics do not know the indigenous languages and that Russian and
other tongues are contaminating their language.
   Tass also reported adoption of Lithuanian as the official
language and said Lithuanian flags could now be displayed at
gatherings, sporting events, song and dance festivals.
   The dispatch did not say whether the flag was the one that flew
in Lithuania before it was incorporated into the Soviet Union, or
whether it was the flag of Soviet Lithuania.
   Lithuanians in Moscow said they believed the order applies to
the independence flag, which had been banned.
   The Soviet Union took over Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia in 1940
under a secret pact with Germany. Activists are demanding that the
Soviet Union renounce the pact.
   Bogusis said activists raised the yellow, green and red
independence flag today atop Gediminas Tower on the square where
the demonstration took place.
   Many people singing the nationalist songs and dancing also
carried the flag, he said. Police, who earlier would have torn down
the flag and arrested nationalist demonstrators, did not interfere,
Bogusis said.

   The release of an Indian hostage prompted
a flurry of reports today about a secret U.S.-Iran deal to free
more captives and about the imminent release of a British hostage.
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz has denied reports that
Washington is negotiating with Iran to release hostages and said
that ``anyone who tries to cut across our policies should butt
out.''
   Lebanese kidnappers warned on Thursday that two American
hostages may be in danger if U.N. troops are sent to Lebanon to
oversee presidential elections.
   Sixteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon. Most are believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists backed
by Iran.
   On Monday, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine
freed Indian hostage Mithileshwar Singh after 20 months of
captivity. Singh, a professor of finance at Beirut University
College, is a legal resident of the United States.
   In Jerusalem, the new English-language weekly The Nation
reported today the United States struck a deal with Iran to free
U.S. hostages in Lebanon, including the supply of arms and spare
parts to Tehran through South Korea.
   The unattributed report said the U.S. government agreed to pay
$7 million in ransom to the militants holding the hostages but
refused the group's demands for immunity from prosecution.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the report was ``not
true.''
   The report said the U.S. refusal to guarantee immunity angered
the kidnappers and prompted them to release Singh instead of Alann
Steen, a U.S. citizen whose release had been expected.
   In addition to Steen, 49, of Boston, the group holds Jesse
Turner, 41, a native of Boise, Idaho; and Robert Polhill, 54, of
New York City. All four taught at Beirut University College.
   Shultz said at the United Nations on Thursday that anyone who
claims to be a U.S. envoy to secret U.S-Iran negotiations is lying.
   ``There is not going to be any deal,'' Shultz said. ``The
hostages should be released.''
   Shultz responded to questions about statements in Paris by
former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr of Iran. Bani-Sadr said an
agent of Vice President George Bush, Richard Lawless, negotiated
Singh's release.
   Two Beirut publications reported today that Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite, missing in Lebanon for more than 20 months, will
be freed in 72 hours.
   One report was carried by the conservative daily Al-Anwar, based
in Christian east Beirut. It has no record of authoritative reports
on the hostage issue, and there was no way to confirm the report.
   Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west Beirut, said Waite and two
other British hostages will be released ``very soon.'' Both
publications cited unidentified informed sources for their reports.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame when it broke the story of
secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in November, 1986. But its recent
reports on the hostages have not been accurate.
   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, which holds
American hostages Terry Anderson, 40, and Thomas Sutherland, 56.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, is the longest-held captive. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   On Thursday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which
claims to hold Joseph James Cicippio of Norristown, Pa. and Edward
Austin Tracy, of Burlington, Vt., said the hostages may be in
danger if U.N. troops are sent to Lebanon.
   ``We shall use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies,
including the card of the safety of the hostages,'' said a
statement typewritten in Arabic and delivered to the independent
newspaper An-Nahar.
   In an accompanying photo, the 58-year-old Cicippio was sitting
on a blanket-covered bed with his hands clasped in his lap, dressed
in a navy blue track suit with red stripes. He was smiling as he
faced the camera, but looked considerably thinner than in previous
pictures released by his captors.
   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University of
Beirut when he was kidnapped on the school's campus on Sept. 12,
1986. Tracy, 57, an author, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986 in Moslem
west Beirut.
   France this week proposed dispatching a U.N. peacekeeping force
to Beirut to oversee election of a new president in Lebanon, a
former French colony.

   Leaders of this week's ``Siege of Atlanta''
begged for more people to attend today's demonstrations during the
final day of anti-abortion protests after a dramatic drop in
attendance.
   The pleas apparently paid off, because about 50 people were
arrested today in two waves of protests at the Midtown Hospital.
   The Rev. Joseph Foreman, regional director of the New York-based
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, told about 40 people at a
rally Thursday night to gather early today for a private strategy
session.
   ``We've gotten predictable,'' Foreman said earlier at a rally at
St. Jude the Apostle Roman Catholic Church.
   Atlanta police first arrested 33 demonstrators early today for
blocking clinic entrances, as some patients had to be taken over
police barricades to get inside, according to witnesses. Later,
about 20 more demonstrators were taken into custody.
   Police did not show the force this morning that they have used
this week, instead asking the protesters to walk to police buses
``like gentlemen and ladies.'' When the demonstrators refused, they
were carried _ but not dragged _ off the clinic property and into
the buses.
   Several dozen supporters stood on the sidelines singing hymns.
   The demonstrations, part of a week of protests dubbed ``The
Siege of Atlanta,'' began Tuesday, when 343 of an estimated 800
protesters were arrested. Since then, participation both in the
daytime demonstrations outside the clinics and nighttime rallies
has fallen steadily.
   Only 14 people were arrested Wednesday and 11 Thursday. The
rallies have dwindled from 1,000 people Monday to fewer than 250
Thursday.
   Speakers at Thursday's rally repeatedly begged for more people
to attend the demonstrations, either to risk arrest or provide
``prayer support.''
   ``I'm pleading with you before the Lord to come with us tomorrow
whether you plan to `rescue' or not,'' Operation Rescue head
Randall Terry said Thursday. Terry and other leaders say they are
not demonstrating, but are ``rescuing'' fetuses from being killed
before they are born.
   Despite the shrinking numbers, protest leaders maintain they are
shutting down clinics temporarily and preventing abortions from
being performed. Clinic operators deny that claim, saying the only
disruption has been in some rescheduled abortions.
   Protest leaders also have complained about police brutality,
mainly during Tuesday's arrests, and charge that police are
deliberately preventing protesters from from getting out of jail.
   But many of those arrested have refused to give their real
names, calling themselves instead Baby Jane Doe or Baby John Doe,
officials said.
   That identification tactic was used in earlier protests, with
demonstrators saying they were expressing solidarity with what they
called the anonymous victims of abortion. Authorities have refused
to release protesters who don't give their real names.
   Of the 368 arrested during the first three days, police said
Thursday that 30 had made bond, which was set at $650.
   To combat the demonstrations, Atlanta's seven clinics that
perform abortions have cooperated by shifting patients from one
clinic to another, or helping provide escorts through the
demonstrators.
   Members of Operation Rescue first appeared in Atlanta during the
Democratic National Convention in July, and stayed in town for much
of the summer. Since the protests began, more than 1,100
anti-abortion protesters have been jailed, mostly on trespassing
charges.
   The Most Rev. Eugene Marino, archbishop of Atlanta, has endorsed
the group's efforts.
   In San Francisco, a federal appeals court Thursday refused to
overturn an injunction prohibiting anti-abortion activists in
Portland from physically intimidating patrons of a health clinic or
yelling loud enough to disrupt business inside.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the injunction
by a U.S. District Court magistrate in Portland does not abridge
First Amendment rights of free speech and is not too vague.
   Advocates for Life, a non-profit corporation that engages in
abortion protests, appealed the ruling.

   Four gunmen burst into the office of
Chile's honorary consul today, hit him on the head with a pistol
butt and fired a shot into the floor, officials said.
   Istanbul Governor Cahit Bayar said the consul, Mordo Dinar, was
slightly injured.
   Bayar said no group claimed responsibility for the attack at
Dinar's law office, which also serves as the Chilean hononary
consulate.
   But the intruders left banners protesting the government of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the governor said. Pinochet lost a referendum
this week he hoped would extend his 15-year-rule until 1997, but he
rejected demands that he step down as president before his term
expires in 1990.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted witnesses as
saying the gunmen spoke Turkish and the banners were in Turkish and
English.
   Bayar said police were searching for the gunmen.

<TEXT>
   Terry Waite, the Anglican church envoy
who has been missing in Lebanon for more than 20 months, will be
freed soon, two Beirut publications reported today.
   One of the publications, the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa, also
said American hostages will be released before the U.S.
presidential election on Nov. 8.
   Both Ash-Shiraa and the conservative daily Al-Anwar cited
unidentified informed sources for its report. There was no way to
confirm that Waite's release was imminent.
   Al-Anwar said one of its sources reported that Waite ``has been
moved from the Bekaa (valley) to Beirut's southern suburbs and
predicted he will be released in 72 hours.''
   But the newspaper said another source claimed Waite, 48, will be
freed after resumption of British-Syrian relations.
   Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west Beirut, said Waite and two
other British hostages will be released ``very soon.''
   The magazine said a recent decision for the restoration of full
diplomatic relations between Britain and Iran ``provided a strong
impetus to efforts currently underway for the release of Waite and
his countrymen.''
   Ash-Shiraa also quoted an unidentified informed security source
as saying Monday's release of hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian
national and legal resident alien of the United States, marked
``the beginning of the release of ... American hostages.''
   ``The source said American hostages would be released before the
U.S. presidential election,'' the report added, without further
elaboration.
   Ash-Shiraa gained fame when it broke the story of secret U.S.
arms sales to Iran in November 1986. But its recent reports on the
hostages have not been accurate. Al-Anwar also has no record of
authoritative reports on the hostages.
   Singh was held by a pro-Iranian underground group calling itself
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. He was kidnapped
Jan. 24, 1987 from the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College
along with American educators Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner.
   London severed diplomatic relations with Damascus in November
1986, after accusing the Syrian government of involvement in a plot
to blow up an Israeli airliner at Heathrow airport. Syria denied
the charge.
   Syria, a strong ally of Iran, has said it was working for the
release of all hostages in Lebanon. Most of captives are held by
Shiite Moslem followers of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Syria also is the main powerbroker in Lebanon. It has an
estimated 40,000 troops in eastern and norther provinces as well as
west and south Beirut.
   The fundamentalists who are believed to hold the foreign
captives are entrenched in areas under Syrian control.
   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, which holds
American hostages Terry Anderson, 40, and Thomas Sutherland, 56.
   Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, is the longest-held captive. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   In all 16 foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Waite, journalist John
McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual British
and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the Irish
government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors have
claimed they killed him. His body was never found.

   Gen. Augusto Pinochet rejected demands
that he resign as president before his term expires in 1990 and
said the military will continue to play a key role in Chile's
future.
   The 72-year-old ruler spoke to the nation after police armed
with clubs fired water cannons and tear gas at crowds who swarmed
the streets Thursday to celebrate Pinochet's defeat in a national
referendum.
   Police said today that two people were killed in the
demonstrations, including a 14-year-old boy shot by unidentified
attackers and a 31-year-old robber shot by police.
   Unknown assailants shot two other people, who were in serious
condition today, police said. Eight officers were injured, one
seriously, and 58 demonstrators were detained and later released,
police said.
   The capital was calm this morning after street scuffles between
roving bands of youths and police in jeeps and water trucks lasted
until midnight.
   In his first public statement since the Wednesday ballot, which
he lost by a margin of more than 11 percent, Pinochet declared
Thursday night: ``I recognize and accept the majority verdict
expressed yesterday by the citizenry.''
   According to the terms of an 8-year-old constitution, Pinochet
remains in power until March 1990, when he will be succeeded by the
winner of open elections planned for late next year.
   Pinohet is not barred from running in the election. He has not
indicated whether he plans to run.
   Reading from a text, the 72-year-old Pinochet warned the
opposition that its plans to amend the existing constitution to
speed up his departure would be in vain.
   ``No one can feel they have the mandate of the people to twist
what the people decided,'' he said, in reference to the
constitution, which was approved by voters in 1980 in a loosely
staged vote that critics complain was rife with fraud.
   Wednesday's vote was well-organized, massively attended and free
of charges of fraud or violence. Pinochet expressed ``the deep
pride I feel at the civic maturity with which each one of you faced
this act of singular importance.''
   Pinochet was dressed in his white dress general's uniform for
the taped speech, broadcast nationwide on all television and radio
stations.
   Triumphant opposition leaders Thursday vowed to press their
demands for Pinochet to allow quick elections and step down soon.
Pinochet seized power in the 1973 coup that toppled elected
President Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   ``An authoritarian system has been overthrown,'' said Socialist
Ricardo Lagos, a director of a 16-party coalition that led the
campaign for Pinochet's defeat. ``It is indispensable now to elect,
within a short period of time, a president and a congress with
powers to modify the constitution.''
   But the opposition faces the challenge of maintaining its unity.
Potentially divisive issues such as human rights trials and the
future of the Communist Party could sow dissent while opposition
leaders negotiate with the armed forces to speed the transition to
full democracy.
   Political maneuvering by top opposition figures for nomination
to the presidency also is expected to influence relations among the
parties in the coalition.
   The constitution, drawn up by the Pinochet administration, calls
for electing a congress in a year. But its provisions leave the
legislature virtually powerless to pass amendments. It also gives
the armed forces autonomy and an influential role in national
policy-making.
   Pinochet, leader of the army, said the military ``will be the
guide in building the future Chile.''
   Early Thursday, small groups of government opponents descended
on downtown to celebrate the referendum result. They were quickly
joined by tens of thousands of others, mostly youths, who virtually
took control of many streets and some avenues in the city's center,
marching and chanting ``Pinochet, go away'' and ``He has fallen.''
   Police only occasionally broke up the early demonstrations, but
the protesters later became more strident and police began using
more force. When the demonstrators began throwing rocks, bottles
and sticks at officers, riot-control squads responded with water
cannons and tear gas in running street battles.

   An Israeli newspaper reported today that the
United States struck a deal with Iran to free U.S. hostages in
Lebanon, including the supply of arms and spare parts to Tehran
through South Korea.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the
report ``not true.''
   The unattributed report in The Nation, an English-language
weekly that began publishing last month, said the U.S. government
agreed to pay $7 million in ransom to the Lebanese Shiite Moslem
extremists holding most of the hostages but refused the group's
demands for immunity from prosecution.
   The United States has denied reports it is involved in
negotiations with Iran over the release of hostages.
   Fitzwater today said he consulted with the national security
adviser, Colin Powell, about the story, and Powell said there were
no such weapons transfers.
   ``There are a lot of free-lancers, independent operators in the
region,'' the spokesman said. But he reiterated administration
statements that none of these independent parties is authorized to
speak for the U.S. government.
   The report in The Nation said the U.S. refusal to guarantee
immunity from prosecution angered the kidnappers and prompted them
to release Indian hostage Mithileshwar Singh on Monday instead of
Alann Steen, a U.S. citizen whose release had been expected.
   According to The Nation, among the steps taken to secure the
release of a foreign hostage was an agreement by South Korea to
sell millions of dollars in spare parts for U.S.-made weapons.
   The newspaper said that two weeks before the release of Singh,
who is a permanent U.S. resident, South Korean Oil Minister Lee
Bong signed an agreement in Tehran to sell the spare parts,
including those needed for the U.S.-made F-5 aircraft used in the
Iranian air force.
   The Reagan administration would have had to approve such a sale
under the standard agreement signed by countries licensed to
manufacture U.S-designed weapons, the newspaper said.
   Today's report also said U.S. citizens who hold Iranian and
Lebanese passports visited two of the hostages in January,
including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. Anderson, the longest held hostage, was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Reporter Giora Shamis told The Associated Press the report in
The Nation was based on interviews with three of about 15 dual
passport holders involved in the contacts as well as South Korean
sources who confirmed an Iranian report about the spare parts deal.
   Shamis is an owner of the London-based news service, Depth,
which sold the story to The Nation.
   According to the report, Iran agreed to put up the $7 million
ransom for the hostages because the United States did not want to
appear to be directly purchasing their freedom.
   The newspaper said the money would be paid indirectly to the
kidnappers by Iran in the form of commissions for Iranian purchases
in the United States. These are to be channeled through Lebanese
and Iranian businessmen to Hezbollah, the radical Shiite group
believed to be holding hostages.
   Sixteen foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon, including
nine Americans.

   Two frugal sisters who never took part in
municipal affairs and never let on how much money they had saved
have surprised the city by leaving it a $1 million trust fund.
   Frances and Elsie Hathaway had no immediate relatives to inherit
the money and wanted to do something special for the town, said
their cousin, Sidney Hathaway.
   Frances, 93, died in March, and Elsie, 94, died in February 1986.
   Hathaway described the women as a quiet, frugal, hard-working
pair who generally kept to themselves. Frances earned her money as
a stenographer and Elsie was a sales manager and worked in the
pharmaceutical industry for more than 50 years.
   ``They never left town, never got involved in local affairs,
never learned how to drive and never married,'' he said. ``They
would get off the Fall River streetcar just before the fare went up
and walk the last quarter-mile home to save a nickel.
   ``That nickel could buy a loaf of bread, they'd say.''
   The $1 million will be invested to provide income for local
educational and charitable pursuits. Roger Lamonde, vice president
of Durfee Attleboro Bank, said it could generate $75,000 a year in
interest.
   A three-member advisory board will recommend to the bank how the
interest should be spent, Lamonde said.

   A Soviet military team said today it was generally
satisfied with its unprecedented snap inspection of a British
military exercise in southern England.
   The four Soviet inspectors scrutinized the 4,400-troop Drum's
Drake exercise for two hours today before departing for Moscow from
London's Heathrow Airport. The team leader, Col. Vladimir
Greshnikov, thanked the British army for its hospitality during
their two-day tour.
   ``The results of the inspection will have to be examined in more
detail, but I am sure they can be considered positive,'' Greshnikov
told a news conference at Heathrow, speaking through an interpreter.
   Greshnikov said his team _ including Anatoli Makhov, Yuri Leonov
and Vladimir Trofimov _ were ``generally satisfied'' with the tour,
adding that ``this kind of inspection will help to build confidence
measures in Europe.''
   The inspectors arrived Wednesday after giving Britain the
36-hour minimum notice for an inspection as required under the 1986
Stockholm Agreement for relaxing East-West tensions.
   They sought to assess the ``character and scale'' of Drake's
Drum, which Britain described as a defensive eight-day exercise to
test protection of airfields, ports and other installations.
   British army Brig. Gen. Mike Tennant, who joined Greshnikov at
the news conference, said the Soviets had seen ``a lot of nothing.''
   The Soviets spent a hectic two days in helicopters and Land
Rovers touring the 5,500-square-mile exercise area near Salisbury,
80 miles southwest of London.
   It was the first time the Soviet Union had called a snap
inspection in Britain under the 35-nation verification treaty,
though British inspectors have dropped in on Soviet maneuvers,
Royal Air Force Vice Marshal Mike Stear said.
   ``I am pleased that the inspection of each other's military
activities is becoming more commonplace, for familiarity does build
confidence and trust,'' Stear said.
   Under the Stockholm Agreement, each nation must tell the others
about major land maneuvers.

Romania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hungary's foreign minister accused Warsaw
Pact ally Romania of violating the human rights of its Hungarian
minority and said Moscow was not taking sides in the dispute.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Peter Varkonyi
leveled the accusation against Romania by name, but in a speech
Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly he decried ``cultural
oppression'' of minorities in ``neighboring countries.''
   ``It is clear that our problem in this regard is with Romania,''
Varkonyi told the AP Thursday.
   Hungary says Romania's Hungarian minority is being
systematically mistreated. Romania denies the accusation.
   Although both sides have publicly criticized each other numerous
times in recent months, Varkonyi's comments were unusually candid
criticism on a senior level of an ally within the Soviet bloc.
   The most recent tensions involve Romanian plans to raze up to
7,000 villages, including about 800 ethnic Hungarian communities.
   The Romanian leadership says it needs the land for development
and plans to resettle the villagers in agro-industrial centers.
Hungarian officials say, however, that the project will destroy
deep-seated traditions of the ethnic Hungarians, who became
Romanian citizens after World War II when Hungary was forced to
cede the territory to Romania.
   In the interview, Varkonyi acknowledged that the conflict was
figuring in Hungarian-Soviet discussions. But he said the Soviet
leadership would ``like us to solve the question'' directly with
Romania.
   A diplomat from a Soviet bloc country, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, suggested that Moscow was particularly reluctant to get
involved in the dispute because of its own problems with ethnic
unrest in Armenia and the Baltic republics.
   Romania denies its 1.7 million Hungarians are being mistreated
and accuses Budapest of interfering in its internal affairs.
   Attempts late Thursday for Romanian comment were unsucessful. No
one answered the telephone at Romania's U.N. mission.
   The resettlement plan touched off mass protests in Hungary,
including a demonstration in front of the Romanian Embassy in
Budapest. Police did not intervene in the protests.
   ``We are all concerned about a situation where an ethnic
minority is about to be stripped of its roots,'' said Varkonyi,
referring to the resettlement project.
   The foreign minister, who was interviewed in Hungarian, denied
that the criticism constituted interference in Romanian matters,
saying, ``We believe that the question of minority rights is not
strictly an internal affair.''
   Hungary has begun to accept refugees from Romania, the only
Soviet bloc country to give asylum to those fleeing from an allied
nation. Varkonyi said about 10,000 Romanian citizens have fled to
Hungary, most of them ethnic Hungarians.
   While there are no official figures on the number of ethnic
Romanians among the refugees, Hungarian officials estimate they
constitute between 10 percent to 15 percent of the total, most of
them fleeing economic hardships and political repression.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, whose
predecessor was under criminal investigation for 14 months, called
on Justice Department officials under him today to develop
proposals that will ``aid our employees in maintaining the highest
ethical standards.''
   In his first major speech to department employees since taking
over from Edwin Meese III in August, Thornburgh said he had asked
Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen to gather the views of
all department managers on ethical standards.
   Thornburgh said that among the questions that should be
addressed are ``How to avoid any appearance of personal and
financial conflict of interest? How to deal with lapses in
behavior, whether job-related or not? How should we properly
regulate interaction between employees and outside groups? What
`perks' are proper and which are out of bounds?''
   ``Top leadership must give forth clear and explicit signals,
lest any confusion or uncertainty exist over what is and is not
permissible conduct,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``To do otherwise allows informal and potentially subversive
`codes of conduct' to be transmitted with a wink and a nod, and
encourages an inferior ethical system based on `going along to get
along' or on the notion that `everybody's doing it,''' he added.
   He said he had asked Christensen ``to gather the views of all
senior management to help in developing proposals that will aid our
employees in maintaining the highest ethical standards.''
   Thornburgh did not mention Meese by name and the new attorney
general brought up the issue of ethics in the context of a new
Associated Press-Media General poll showing that seven out of 10
Americans think illegal payoffs are common in the federal
government. Half of those polled said the federal government is not
honest overall.
   Meese came under criminal investigation in May 1987 because of
his dealings with longtime friend E. Robert Wallach in connection
with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a South Bronx, N.Y., defense
contractor whose top executives admitted making payoffs to numerous
public officials in exchange for assistance in obtaining federal
contracts.
   The investigation of the attorney general eventually spread to
his actions on behalf of the regional Bell telephone companies at a
time when he held stock in them, as well as other matters.
   The probe culminated in July with independent counsel James
McKay deciding not to seek an indictment, but declaring publicly
that Meese had probably broken conflict-of-interest laws and tax
laws.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of parents lined up at clinics
to immunize their babies against polio today in the first stage of
Israel's nationwide campaign to vaccinate all residents under the
age of 40.
   The Health Ministry announced the campaign following an outbreak
of the disease that has affected at least nine people.
   About 3.2 million people will be vaccinated over the next four
weeks, according to ministry spokesman Shmuel Algrabli.
   The campaign does not include the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Algrabli said this is because Gaza residents have been
immunized with a highly effective combined Sabin-Salk vaccine. In
the West Bank, he said, officials are testing sewage to determine
whether to extend the campaign there.
   The first stage of the campaign will encompass the towns of
Rehovot near Tel Aviv and Acre in the north, where the polio virus
has been found in sewage.
   In Rehovot, large yellow posters plastered on the walls informed
residents when various age groups should report to clinics for
vaccinations.
   Meanwhile, the Tourism Ministry expressed concern that reports
of the outbreak would keep visitors away from Israel.
   Israel has already suffered a sharp drop in tourism this year as
a result of the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.
   The immunization campaign was undertaken after health officials
received the recommendations of a team of international health
experts called to Israel after the first polio cases were
diagnosed, Algrabli said.
   No cases of polio were reported in Israel last year and only one
case was reported in 1986. The recent cases have been blamed on
overflowing sewage.
   Polio is an infectious disease that causes muscular paralysis.

   A transient drove a stolen church bus
to a public elementary school and tried to pick up a load of

said.
   Lee Villarreal, 36, was charged with auto theft after Clay
County Sheriff's deputies arrested him Wednesday at Middleburg
Elementary School.
   Villarreal arrived at the school and tried to get in line with
other buses as children were preparing to board, Assistant

   A bus-duty teacher notified Clarkson when she became suspicious
because she didn't recognize the bus, said Twila Shrewsbury, the
school's principal.
   ``The assistant principal thought the driver was at the wrong
school and asked the man to come inside so he Clarkson could find
out where he the driver should be,'' Ms. Shrewsbury said.
   They called Calvary Baptist Church, which owns the bus, and
learned that the bus had been stolen. Police were called and
Villarreal was arrested.
   Authorities had no motive in the case. Villarreal was in the
county jail today on $35,002 bond.

   Republican George Bush today cited crime as
the issue on which he is most at odds with Michael Dukakis, saying
his Democratic rival has ``an astounding lack of sensitivity'' to
crime victims.
   Bush said Dukakis had presided over a criminal justice system in
Massachusetts that is ``completely out of whack: a `Twilight Zone'
world where prisoners' right to privacy had more weight than the
citizen's right to safety.''
   Bush, in remarks prepared for delivery to law enforcement
officials, said Dukakis ``still clings to a discredited liberal
idology that blinds him to the true causes of crime.''
   Bush said Dukakis only amended his state's prison furlough law
this year ``under the bright spotlight of the national presidential
campaign.'' Last spring, Dukakis ended furloughs for convicted
murderers serving life without parole.
   Bush said Dukakis should have apologized to a Maryland couple
savagely attacked by convicted murderer Willie Horton, who had been
granted a weekend Massachusetts furlough in 1986. The couple, Cliff
and Angi Barnes, have agreed to tape radio ads on behalf of Bush's
campaign.
   ``As far as I know ... he has never apologized,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm not faulting the governor of Massachusetts for one error
in judgment. But it concerns me deeply that in all this time, as
far as I know, the governor has never acknowledged that his
furlough program was a mistake,'' Bush said.
   ``While the governor has shown great compassion for the
difficulties of prisoners and their families _ and no doubt their
hardships are severe _ when it comes to the plight of the victims
and their families, there is what one can only describe as an
astounding lack of sensitivity, a lack of human compassion.''
   The Bush campaign is seizing on the law and order issue as the
tight race with Dukakis nears Election Day. Another crime-oriented
speech is set for Monday in New Jersey.
   The GOP ticket was eager to move beyond reverberations from the
vice presidential debate. Though Bush praised running mate Dan
Quayle, campaign manager Lee Atwater on Thursday focused on
comparing Bush and Dukakis.
   ``You're going to see this debate won't make a difference,''
Atwater told reporters traveling with the campaign. ``The focus of
the race is going to be between two gladiators'' _ Bush and Dukakis.
   While a CBS News poll found that 50 percent of the likely voters
surveyed thought Bentsen won the debate to 27 percent for Quayle,
Atwater was claiming that Bush has solidified an Electoral College
base of 210 to 220 of the 270 votes needed to win.
   ``That gives us an opportunity to really concentrate on three or
four states in the waning days of the campaign,'' he said.
   Asked to name the states, Atwater declined, giving only a list
of what he said are competitive states, including California,
Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Missouri, New Mexico, and Arkansas.
   While Bush praised his running mate immediately after the
debate, he did not mention Quayle at all in his first speech
Thursday morning in Fort Worth, Texas.
   After reporters asked his aides about the omission, Bush opened
two later rallies hailing Quayle's performance.
   At the Permian Basin Oil Museum in Midland, Bush prefaced his
energy policy speech with a lengthy ode to Texas, reciting
anecdotes about his move there from New England as a young man and
his start in the oil business painting rigs similar to the one
behind him.
   He said he was the only candidate ``who shares the values of the
people of Texas ... My values have not changed since the 1950s.''
   Bush strategists professed to be unconcerned about Bentsen's
heavy campaigning in Texas, the state he represents in the U.S.
Senate.
   ``The problem is he can't sell Michael Dukakis,'' said Bush
regional political director Jim Shearer. ``Lloyd Bentsen is a
popular Texan, there's no doubt about it. But he's selling the
wrong soap down here.''
   The Bush campaign has been using an anti-crime TV commercial in
Texas and will begin an ad focusing on defense, which as an
industry is responsible for a hefty number of jobs in Texas,
Shearer said.
   The anti-crime theme apparently will be a central one for Bush
in the waning days of the campaign, with another law-and-order
speech slated for Monday in New Jersey.
   In his Fort Worth speech, Bush proposed doubling the nation's
spending on new prison construction, with the addition of $250
million annually over the next four years. He also said he would
set up a Justice Department anti-gang unit to work with local
jurisdictions.
   He said money seized from drug busts should be used to help fund
the new prisons.
   ``I say that our society can simply not afford any more liberal
experimentation with crime. It's time to get serious about serious
crime,'' he said in a speech where he repeatedly used the word
``liberal'' to criticize failed anti-crime policies and linked them
to Dukakis.

   Bic is recalling its new, regular size
fixed-flame cigarette lighters because some of them may fail to
extinguish, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced
today.
   About 6.5 million of the lighters have been distributed since
they were introduced in July, the agency said.
   No incidents or injuries have been reported involving the
lighters. But the company decided on the recall after determining
that the fire may not go out on 0.04 percent of the lighters, the
commission reported. The problem has been corrected on lighters now
being made, officials said.
   The lighters in question are sold in a plastic pouch or tray and
are labeled ``with fixed flame.'' They can be identified because
they do not have the small wheel used on some lighters to adjust
the flame size.
   Bic Mini fixed flame lighters and Bic regular sized adjustable
lighters, which represent 98 percent of Bic lighters on the market,
are not involved in the recall, the commission said.
   Consumers should stop use of the regular size fixed flame
lighters and return them to the store where purchased for a refund.
Those needing more information can contact the commission at
1-800-638-2772.

   Republican vice presidential nominee
Dan Quayle said today he was not worried about new television ads
aimed at him by the Dukakis campaign because ``they obviously don't
have anything bad to say about George Bush.''
   Quayle was asked by reporters as he toured a technical school
whether he had become the key issue in the campaign.
   ``We can stand the attention. We can stand the heat. We're going
to stay in the kitchen,'' Quayle said. ``George Bush is going to be
the next president of the United States. The voters will vote for
him.''
   Quayle was greeted by a group of about 75 protesters as he
toured Chattanooga State Technical Community College. Some carried
signs reading, ``We will all pray if Dan becomes president.''
   During a tour of the school's robotics lab, Quayle was asked by
reporters about ads the Dukakis campaign unveiled Thursday aimed at
driving home the idea that Bush had picked an unqualified man as
his running mate.
   ``I haven't seen them. I've heard about them. They obviously
don't have anything bad to say about George Bush and that's fine
with me,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle has shrugged off polls indicating voters believe he lost
the vice presidential debate and doubt his qualifications.
   Despite that rhetoric, Quayle acknowledged to reporters Thursday
that he could have answered more fully questions from debate
panelists about what he would do if he became president.
   But the Indiana senator focused his efforts Thursday on
attacking Democratic counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, saying he
``waffled, shuffled, ducked and dived'' questions about his
differences with ticketmate Michael Dukakis.
   Quayle was campaigning today in Chattanooga, Atlanta and
Raleigh, N.C., before returning to Washington.
   ``We're on the march toward victory,'' Quayle told reporters who
asked him upon arrival here how he felt a day after the debate. He
said he had had ``a great day.''
   ``I think you can tell the real enthusiasm that the crowds have
generated,'' Quayle said at a Pensacola, Fla., stop.
   He spent Thursday refining his answer to questions he was
repeatedly asked in Wednesday night's debate about how he would
handle the presidency.
   Polls all along have shown substantial skepticism among the
voters about Quayle's qualifications. A new CBS poll done after the
debate found 47 percent of the likely voters surveyed felt he was
qualified, compared with 78 percent for Bentsen. And both CBS and
ABC polls said a resounding majority of those who viewed the debate
thought Bentsen had won.
   Quayle said he was ``not at all worried'' about the polls,
adding ``we're still ahead.''
   ``As far as we're concerned, the important polls are those from
the key electoral states,'' said Quayle spokesman David Prosperi.
``The only poll we're interest in is on Nov. 8.''
   But the campaign was clearly concerned about the fallout from
Quayle's response to questions about what he would do if he had to
step into the presidency. He had answered that he would first pray
and then convene a Cabinet session but did not go further, electing
to talk mostly about his congressional experience and
qualifications.
   ``When I was asked that question, I made a judgment that the
people of America deserved to hear me outline the level of my
qualifications and the depth of my experience to assume the
presidency,'' Quayle said in speeches in Missouri and Florida.
   ``I responded to that point and the core of my thinking is this:
There is no question that I would maintain and build on the
excellent policies of a president George Bush.''
   Asked by reporters on his plane why he had not made that
response during the debate, Quayle said: ``It was a very narrow
hypothetical ... I hadn't had that question before.
   ``By convening a Cabinet session, that certainly implies that
you're going to continue the policies of George Bush. I did not say
that, but that's certainly implied. I think I did just fine last
night.''
   One of Quayle's defenders was former President Gerald Ford, who
told a Springfield, Mo., fund-raiser, ``I think Dan Quayle is an
outstanding young man and he will do a superb job as the next vice
president.''
   Ford, himself a former Michigan congressman, said that on the
issue of qualifications, Quayle's 12 years in Congress were more
than enough.
   ``I happen to think that people who come from the Congress are
better trained to serve in the executive branch ... than some
inexperienced governor with a wild-eyed, left-wing liberal
philosophy like the Democratic candidate's,'' Ford said.
   Quayle attacked Bentsen in strong terms, saying that he had been
unable to defend Dukakis' positions.
   ``I am proud of the man at the top of my ticket,'' Quayle said.
``I am happy to support his positions, and I won't run away from
them like Senator Bentsen did last night.''

   The United States has proposed to the Soviet
Union that it accept decisions of the World Court in
interpretations of a host of international treaties, a U.S.
official said today.
   Some of the decision deal with such technical subjects as
patents and others with diplomatic privileges. The United States is
a party to must of the treaties but the Soviets over the years have
registered ``reservations'' that exempt them from the effects of
many of the treaties, said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The U.S. proposals, which also involve greater use of the court,
were conveyed to Moscow during the summer in response to hints from
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials in
United Nations speeches that they were prepared to consider changes.
   The United States is coordinating its approach with a number of
Western allies, the official said. He declined to provide further
details, saying it was ``a sensitive subject.''
   But the official said ``a host of multilateral treaties'' were
involved.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley stressed Thursday
that ``it's our view that issues involving the use of force and
national security do not belong in the International Court of
Justice.''
   She said further discussions would be held with the Soviets and
that she had no details of possible suggested changes in the
court's operations.
   Two years ago, in an unprecedented move, the Reagan
administration rejected the court's jurisdiction in a dispute with
Nicaragua.
   The Marxist government in Managua had sued the United States
before the court for mining its harbors and aiding Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Mrs. Oakley's statement indicated the administration held to the
view, which was developed by Abraham D. Sofaer, a former federal
judge who is the State Department chief legal counsel.
   The New York Times quoted Sofaer on Thursday as saying the
United States had responded ``in a constructive way'' to
Gorbachev's initiative.
   Sofaer said the United States had suggested the court be
permitted to arbitrate a list of specific disputes between
Washington and Moscow and agree in advance to accept its verdict,
the Times reported.
   If accepted by Moscow and the U.S. Senate, the article said, the
U.S. proposals would bind both nations to World Court verdicts in
disputes over certain treaties.
   Mrs. Oakley said ``the U.S. has made a proposal on the issue of
greater use of the ICJ (International Court of Justice) to the
Soviets this summer, which is wholly consistent with this
administration's view of the appropriate role of the Court in
resolve international disputes.''
   She said this did not involve a change in the stand the
administration took in the dispute with Nicaragua.
   Sofaer did not respond to efforts to reach him by telephone for
details.

   A woman who said she shot her husband 14
times because he had beaten and abused her for years was acquitted
of murder.
   Cynthia Iandola, 36, was charged with first-degree murder after
she shot her husband, Jack, in the kitchen of their home Jan. 11.
   A McHenry County jury deliberated nine hours before reaching the
verdict, which was greeted by cheers in the courtroom when it was
announced Thursday.
   Mrs. Iandola contended the killing was in self-defense because
her husband had threatened to kill her and their two children.
   She testified that in one incident a few days before the
shooting, her husband sexually abused her with the barrel of a gun
and indicated that he might try to rape their 13-year-old daughter.
   Much of her testimony was corroborated by witnesses at her trial.
   Judge Roland Herrmann refused to allow defense attorneys to
present expert testimony indicating that Mrs. Iandola was a victim
of ``battered woman's syndrome,'' a phenomenon in which the wife
submits passively to abuse from a bullying husband.
   During the trial, State's Attorney Thomas F. Baker conceded that
Iandola was a ``bully'' who brutalized his family but said Mrs.
Iandola should have deserted him or sought protection from the
police or social agencies.

   Israeli troops shot and killed three
Palestinians and wounded 14 in the West Bank city of Nablus today,
Arab reporters and hospital officials said.
   Army officials confirmed one Palestinian was killed but said
soldiers were not involved. The other two deaths were being
checked, a spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The three deaths raised the number of Palestinians killed in the
10-month-old uprising to 287. Six Israelis have also died.
   Arab reporters claimed Samir Bahloul, 26, was shot to death
standing in the doorway of his house in Nablus, a city of 120,000.
   They said Nidal Ali Najar, 20, was fatally wounded after dozens
of youths gathered outside the central market to throw stones at
soldiers in protest of the killing of Bahloul.
   A third victim, Ali Sayeh, 20, was dead on arrival at St. John's
Hospital in Nablus after being shot in the chest during a clash in
the Ras Al Ain neighborhood, Arab reporters and hospital officials
said.
   All victims died from Israeli army gunfire, the Arab reports
said.
   Earlier today, hundreds of Palestinians marched in a funeral
procession for Adnan Hanfa, 31, who was shot to death in a clash
with soldiers Thursday. The mourners carried outlawed PLO flags and
chanted pro-Palestine Liberation Organization slogans, a witness
said.
   Israeli authorities, in an attempt to calm the city, announced
from mosque loudspeakers that prayers would take place as scheduled
today and the army would not intefere.
   An Arab reporter in Gaza City said shops were closed for the
second consecutive day today in a separate strike.
   In Jerusalem, city officials said the opening of 32 Arab junior
high and high schools went smoothly Thursday when 6,000 students
returned to classes.
   Authorities delayed the opening of the academic year because
they feared classrooms would be used as focal points for organizing
demonstrations.
   On Thursday, Moslem fundamentalists said they have ended their
rift with leaders of a PLO-linked group in the occupied lands. The
reconciliation was announced in a leaflet saying the groups would
focus on a common enemy: Israel.
   ``The competition should be in how we fight the enemy,'' the
statement said. ``The most dangerous weapon that the enemy is using
is the policy of splitting our people.''
   Army officials played down the rapprochement between the
fundamentalist group Hamas and the PLO-linked Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising.
   ``I'm not sure it means they are going to stop fighting,'' one
official said on condition of anonymity.
   Hamas advocates the destruction of Israel and is at odds with
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, which has advocated more
moderate policies and is considering recognition of the Jewish
state.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen today made light of Republican assertions that Dan Quayle
held his own during their vice presidential debate.
   ``I was reading the paper this morning where George Bush said he
thought Dan Quayle won that, and yet every ... I'm sorry,'' Bentsen
said, breaking into laughter and drawing a roar from a crowd at a
Democratic breakfast.
   ``And yet every poll showed we won, and I'd say `George, as
President Reagan would say, facts are very troubling things,''
Bentsen said.
   The Texas senator said the Democrats were better on key issues
to his home state, including a realistic defense policy, a strong
trade policy, and help for the domestic oil industry. And he said
his debate might later be seen as ``a turning point'' in this
year's campaign.
   Bentsen ridiculed Quayle for trying to compare himself in the
debate to President Kennedy. It was an ``incredible misfit,'' he
said, ticking off Kennedy's accomplishments.
   Despite Bentsen's presence on the ticket, Bush leads Michael
Dukakis in the Lone Star state by up to 10 points, according to
recent polls. The Democrats contend the gap isn't that big, and
Bentsen is campaigning heavily in Texas during the next few days in
hopes of tightening th race for the state's 29 electoral votes.
   ``The next couple of days I think will be significant,'' said
Joe O'Neill, Bentsen's campaign chief of staff. ``We can move these
numbers in the next couple of weeks.''
   Bentsen planned to continue stumping across Texas today, with
events in Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. After a stop in New
Mexico, he planned to hit El Paso on Saturday and then return to
the state for part of his campaign trip next week.
   Bentsen studied for the debate in Texas, and he returned to the
state Thursday. He met up with Dukakis at a rally in Lone Star, in
East Texas.
   ``Last night, the eyes of Texas and the whole nation were on
you, and they liked what they saw,'' Dukakis told his running mate.
   Normally, Bentsen introduces Dukakis but their roles were
reversed as Dukakis sought to show off his running mate as a
conquering hero.
   Bentsen declined to praise himself, but he picked up on his
pre-debate pattern of criticizing Quayle.
   ``After listening to Dan Quayle last night, I can understand why
he kept talking about job training,'' he said at the rally.
   ``The polls show that those that were concerned about his
qualifications for the presidency had that buttressed by the debate
last night,'' he told reporters.
   A new CBS News poll done after the debate found 78 percent of
the 412 debate watchers surveyed felt Bentsen was qualified to be
president, if that became necessary, to 47 percent for Quayle.
   Asked who won the debate, 50 percent in the survey chose Bentsen
and 27 percent said Quayle. The result was almost precisely the
same as the 51-27 percent split in the ABC News poll done
immediately after the debate ended Wednesday night.
   The campaign hopes to take advantage of the momentum from the
perceived debate victory with the help of its new national
television ads and phone banks assembled for the final weeks of the
campaign.
   In Texas, Republicans have been hitting Dukakis hard on the
issues of crime and gun control, and the Democratic campaign was
considering running some Texas-specific ads to start fighting back,
a campaign aide said.
   President Reagan and other Republicans contended Thursday that
Bentsen's admonishing of Quayle during the debate that he was ``no
Jack Kennedy'' was a ``cheap shot'' and a planned response. Bentsen
denied both.
   ``What happened there was Quayle kept comparing himself with
Kennedy, just overreaching himself, and I got fed up with it,''
Bentsen said. ``I deeply resented him trying to put Kennedy's
mantle over himself when he didn't have a record that compared with
Kennedy.''
   Bentsen and Kennedy were elected to Congress together in 1948.
Bentsen served three terms in the House before dropping out of
politics for 16 years to pursue a business career.

   An explosion today damaged a
bookstore in a white suburb of Durban and injured two people,
police said. Shortly afterward, a bomb was found in a downtown
branch of the store.
   The blast occurred around 2 p.m. at the Central News Agency
bookstore in suburban Pinetown, police said.
   About an hour later, police said they found a bomb at a Central
News Agency branch in downtown Durban. Police evacuated thousands
of people from surrounding office buildings and cordoned off the
area, witnesses said.
   On Thursday, six people were hurt, including one seriously, when
a bomb exploded outside the municipal offices of a mixed-race
township near Johannesburg, police said.
   A limpet mine placed in a trash bin also damaged windows and
walls of the municipal building in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg,
police added.
   The victims included three men and three women, police said. The
government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said one of the
women was in serious condition.
   There have been almost daily bombings in recent weeks in South
Africa. The 29 bombings in September were the most ever in the
country in a single month.
   Police have blamed virtually all of the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress, the main black guerrilla group
attempting to overthrow the white-led government.
   Police say the ANC has intensified its bombing campaign in a bid
to disrupt the nationwide municipal elections set for Oct. 26.
   There have been about 150 bombings in South Africa since the
government declared a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986.

   Two men who admitted setting fire to a house
suspected of being used to deal cocaine have been acquitted by a
jury, leading city officials to warn against vigilante action.
   Jury foreman Anthony Allen said Thursday's verdict was a way of
telling city officials more has to be done to fight drugs.
   ``I imagine the verdict does send out a message in two
directions _ to the mayor and to the Police Department that more
has to be done about crack houses,'' Allen said.
   Angelo Parisi and Perry Kent were found innocent after a two-day
trial. They admitted setting the fire, saying they feared for the
safety of children in their neighborhood.
   ``I hope this verdict sends no message,'' Presiding Judge Craig
Strong told the jurors. ``It applies to the facts only in this
case.''
   But some jurors said they cleared Parisi and Kent because
Detroit's drug problem could cause people to take extreme measures.
   ``(I) would have probably done the same thing. No. I would have
been more violent,'' juror Raymond Bandemer said.
   The charges stemmed from fires in October and November 1987 at
an abandoned house allegedly occupied by drug dealers who the
defendants testified had turned their quiet, working-class
neighborhood into a place of fear.
   ``They were laughing at the neighborhood,'' Kent testified.
   Defense attorney David Steingold said residents of the
neighborhood were continually frightened by the sound of gunfire.
   Parisi and Kent said they started the fires after police failed
to investigate complaints filed by them and other residents.
   Law enforcement authorities said they don't condone vigilantism
and will take all possible measures to prevent such activity.
   Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hair said he ``will not permit
law-abiding citizens to break the law on the theory that they're
frustrated ... Vigilantism simply will not be tolerated.''

<HEAD>Studies Find High Rates Of Smokeless Tobacco Use Among American
Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young American Indians are using smokeless
tobacco at an alarming rate, say health researchers who have found
children as young kindergarteners chewing tobacco or taking snuff.
   New studies reported Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control
found that use of smokeless tobacco among Indian teen-agers on
reservations is higher than among rural non-Indian adolescents;
that Indians start using it at a younger age; and that boys and
girls alike show frequent use of it on Indian reservations.
   As many as 21 percent of kindergarten children on reservations
use smokeless tobacco, the researchers said, and by the time they
reach high school age, 37 percent already show related signs of
mouth disease.
   Smokeless tobacco _ such as snuff and chewing tobacco _ causes
mouth cancer and other oral disease, and can produce nicotine
addiction similar to that of cigarette smoking, according to
federal health officials.
   The CDC did not speculate on reasons for the increased use of
smokeless tobacco by reservation youths, but said more research is
needed.
   In a 1986 survey on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in
rural South Dakota, 37 percent of the students in grades 7-12 and
18 percent of those in grades kindergarten-6 said they regularly
used smokeless tobacco _ including 21 percent of the kindergarten
pupils.
   In grades K-6, boys used smokeless tobacco more often than girls
by a margin of 21 percent to 15 percent. But by grades 7-12, the
margin was only 39 percent to 35 percent.
   By contrast, the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health estimates
that 2 percent of U.S. adult men and 0.5 percent of adult women use
smokeless tobacco. An estimated 22 million Americans have used it.
   Another survey, comparing non-Indian children in rural Minnesota
with their Indian counterparts on four rural South Dakota
reservations, found the Indian youth 10 times more likely to use
smokeless tobacco _ 34 percent to 3.4 percent. That was despite the
fact that ``both groups lived outside urban areas and would be
expected to share certain characteristics,'' the CDC said.
   That same survey suggested ``that this behavior is not
necessarily learned from parents,'' the CDC said. Indian
adolescents reported that only 14 percent of their fathers and 3
percent of their mothers had ever used smokeless tobacco.
   Smokeless tobacco use, however, was much lower among urban
Indians than their counterparts on reservations. A survey of
Indians on Montana's Blackfeet Reservation and in the city of Great
Falls, Mont., found that while 19 percent of the males 15-24 in the
city used smokeless tobacco, on the reservation, the percentage was
57. A similar difference was reported among young women, 3 percent
to 12 percent.
   That same survey found sharp differences in use among young
Indians and their parents. Twenty percent of the Blackfeet men over
34 and 3 percent of the women over 34 used smokeless tobacco,
compared again to 57 percent and 12 percent among the 15-24 age
groups.

   Just how much heat do 100
candles generate?
   Apparently enough to set off fire alarms at Richmond Memorial
Hospital, bringing four fire trucks and 16 firefighters to
interrupt a patient's birthday party.
   About 115 family members, friends and fellow patients had
gathered Thursday in this Vancouver suburb to celebrate Katome
Koboyashi's 100th birthday.
   ``They had arranged to wheel her out into the main room at the
same time the family was to wheel in the cake from the other
side,'' said party organizer Anne De Silva.
   Just as Kobayashi and her cake were to meet, the crowd was
startled by the alarms.
   ``It was more confused than anything else,'' De Silva said. ``In
the end, we even forgot to have her blow out the candles.''
   ``We just got there, canceled the alarm and got the heck out,''
said district fire chief Harry Beetstra. ``We didn't want to
disturb the party.''

   A lawmaker says the Army will review records
of black World War I heroes to determine whether any were denied
high honors because of their race.
   The study was initiated after Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci acknowledged that racism could have played a role in the
awarding of combat medals in both world wars, Rep. Joseph DioGuardi
disclosed in releasing letters from Carlucci and one of his aides.

   Here is a sampling of commentary in foreign newspapers on the
vice-presidential debate between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle in Omaha, Neb., Wednesday night:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Jan Krauze, writing from Washington in Le Monde (independent)
of Paris: ``Mastering his nerves right to the end (Quayle) avoided
the gaffe, the catastrophic error that would have sealed his fate,
but one sensed too much, during the last part of the debate, that
he was making a considerable effort to try to show he was up to the
challenge. The tension, too strong, lasted too long and, deep in
the eyes of the `handsome kid,' one perceived clearly the shadow of
a wounded, insulted pride.
   ``The essential ... was to put to the test a man whose presence
on the Republican `ticket' poses, by all the evidence, a problem.
Dan Quayle was neither brilliant nor ridiculous and, if the problem
remains, it is not necessarily as serious as the Democrats hoped.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Guardian (liberal) of London: ``Mr. Quayle managed to avoid
any gaffe which would significantly alter the course of the
election campaign. ... But his presumptuous comparison of his
congressional record with President Kennedy's, so magisterially
squashed by Mr. Bentsen, serves to reinforce existing doubts about
his maturity, intelligence and judgment. Mr. Quayle was
unconvincing, if not pathetic, when asked three times what he would
do first if he became president. His initial response _ that he
would pray _ was doubtless fervently echoed around the country. By
contrast, the suave and courtly Bentsen, seen by some as the most
convincing potential president around, remained firmly in control.
...
   ``In their television debate, it was the Democratic candidate
who showed the cool intelligence and articulacy which Europeans
find reassuring. ... His (Quayle's) view that Mikhail Gorbachev is
different only in style from Leonid Brezhnev, and that perestroika
is nothing more than refined Stalinism, suggests a shaky grasp of
international affairs. ...
   ``If the Republicans lose on 8 November, unlikely though this
may now seem, the Quayle factor will rightly be high among likely
causes.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRAZIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Folha de S. Paulo (independent) of Sao Paulo: ``Quayle came off
much better than expected, but he has two serious problems: he's 41
but looks 21. Would the majority of voters accept such a young
president, if a tragedy struck George Bush? The second problem is
that the American media has indelibly hammered into the public
consciousness Quayle's evasion of military service in the Vietnam
War and the `string-pullers' he used to get his precarious law
degree. ...
   ``Bensten was a disappointment. He's 67 but looks older. He
began with a hoarse voice that suggested physical frailty. And he
made the same mistake that has beleaguered Michael Dukakis'
campiagn: an excess of explanations about complex subjects and an
excess of statistics, that the majority of the public doesn't
follow or understand.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANADA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Globe and Mail (independent) of Toronto: ``In Wednesday
night's televised debate, U.S. Senator Dan Quayle proved himself to
be everything that most people who know him say he isn't. He isn't
very bright. He isn't very thoughtful. And he isn't well informed.
   Mr. Quayle is not qualified to be Vice-President of the United
States. The problem is not his age (41) or even his caricatured
conservative posturings. The problem is his intellect, which,
combined with a poor education and narrow work experience outside
politics, deprives him of the basic tools to do the job. Part of
the job, is, of course, assuming the presidency in the event of a
mid-term vacancy. Mr. Quayle will have the whole world fervently
drinking to George Bush's health if the Republicans win the White
House on Nov. 8.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ITALY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Correspondent Rodolfo Brancoli, writing in Corriere della Sera
(moderate) of Milan: ``What a mistake the young Quayle made!
Blond-tufted and arrogant, he compared himself to John Kennedy and
received one of those responses that go down in the annals of
politics. He never did recover and finished the television debate
stammering.
   ``... (Quayle's comparison) was the only memorable moment of the
1988 campaign. Until that moment, he had been able to get out of
the worst, firing off responses that were clearly preconcocted but
at any rate avoiding any trouble.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Il Tempo (conservative) of Milan: ``All in all during the
debate, Quayle carried himself well and responded blow for blow to
Bentsen's statements. On the countrary, often he gave the
impression that he knew how to show off his youth and dynamic
visual appeal.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _L'Unita (Communist) of Rome: ``For some it was the slap that
Quayle deserved for his conceit. ... For others it was a low blow
that risks backfiring on the one who delivered it.''
   ``For the rest, the two duellers ... made their audience wish
for the greyness of the Dukakis-Bush debate. Both of them gave the
impression of reciting a lesson learned by heart, more even than
their respective number ones.''

<HEAD>Downed Contra Flyer Sues Secord, Hakim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent three months in a Nicaraguan prison
after his Contra supply plane was shot down has filed a $135
million damage suit against two men and two companies linked to the
Iran-Contra arms deals.
   Eugene Hasenfus' federal suit accuses Richard Secord, Albert
Hakim and CIA-linked Southern Air Transport and Corporate Air
Sevices of misrepresenting the rebel supply mission as a patriotic
effort when in fact they were making profits off the deal.
   ``Secord and Hakim had a history of profiteering in arms
transactions and undertook participation in the Contra assistance
effort with the intent of deriving substantial profits for
themselves,'' the suit charges.
   The suit was belittled by Secord's Washington attorney Thomas C.
Green, who said Thursday that Hasenfus knew the risks of the
flights.
   ``Nobody put a gun to Hasenfus and told him to step on the
airplane,'' Green said. ``This is a clasic case of a mercenary who
knew about the risks, and yet chose in his adult mind to go ahead
with it.''
   Hasenfus said that when he was hired in May 1986 he was told the
operation would be a first-class operation like Air America during
the Vietnam war.
   But he said the defendants failed to give the plane adequate
defense systems, such as a way to avoid heat-seeking missiles.
   ``In fact, defendants intentionally refused to supply parachutes
to Hasenfus and others, apparently so that there would be no
survivors in the event of a crash,'' charges the suit, filed
Tuesday.
   Three fellow crewmen aboard the plane died in the crash.
   He also said his employers had promised his wife they would take
care of his defense after he was shot down in October 1986, but
failed to do so.
   As a result of the defendants' promises of help, Hasenfus' wife
Sally, also a plaintiff in the suit filed Tuesday, never set up a
defense committee, the suit says.
   Although convicted of aiding the Contra rebels fighting
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, Hasenfus was released
three months later.
   Hakim and Secord, a retired Air Force major general, are accused
with former National Security Council figures Oliver North and John
Poindexter of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting
proceeds from the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran to the Contras
at a time when Congress banned U.S. military aid to the rebels.

<TEXT>
   A message the opposition says was sent by
the office of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to Communist Party leaders
in factories restates the authorities' public stance against
legalizing Solidarity.
   But the telexed message left open the possibility of changing
the trade union law after talks this month between Solidarity
leaders and the government. The message was dated Sept. 26.
   A Solidarity spokesman today said he was not concerned about the
message and Solidarity would enter the talks anyway. He said it was
significant that it was addressed to party cells and not to factory
managers.
   ``We are not running away from a discussion about the shape of
the union movement, but we think that it must take into account the
fact that the union question is an element of a broader problem of
the functioning of the political system,'' the message said.
   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said today he could not
confirm or deny the authenticity of the text, read over the
telephone to Western news agencies by Solidarity activists late
Thursday.
   But the official PAP news service later ran a one-sentence
report saying the ``secret document'' quoted by Western news
agencies ``does not exist.''
   The text contained nothing new on the government's position
regarding Solidarity, but it underlined the degree of concern over
Solidarity chapters springing up openly in many factories on the
eve of the promised talks.
   It urged party leaders to draw pro-Solidarity activists into
officially sanctioned unions, giving them proportional
representation in official union leaderships and making the
official unions reflect workers' demands.
   At the same time, the message warned against allowing the
opposition to make gains of its own on the factory floors.
   ``The main real danger ... is the rebirth of Solidarity
structures as they existed in 1981, that is, as a party of strikes
and confrontation. This is what we must all focus our attention
on,'' the message said.
   The government and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa agreed to the
talks on Poland's future during a wave of strikes in August. The
talks are expected to begin around Oct. 17.
   The opposition has stressed that the talks must result in
recognition of Solidarity, suppressed by authorities since a Dec.
13, 1981, martial-law crackdown.
   The government has said repeatedly that it will not agree to any
arrangement that would bring divisions on the factory floor and
that it supports the principle of one union in one workplace.
   According to the text read by Solidarity, the telex was from
Stanislaw Domagala, the head of the chancellory of the party
Central Committee secretariat, and was addressed to first
secretaries of party committees at the nation's factories.
   Solidarity spokesmen did not disclose how they received the
document.

   The Oil Barrel Special, a four-course meal that
costs the same as the day's price of a barrel of crude, is back on
the menu at La Colombe d'Or.
   The restaurant began the lunch promotion two years ago but
stopped when oil prices began inching upward.
   ``As soon as the oil price drop hit the papers this week, we had
people calling us up and asking whether we still had the Oil Barrel
Special,'' proprietor Steve Zimmerman said Thursday. ``I said, `Why
not?'''
   ``So today we decided to offer it again. We sold 23 lunches at
the price of a barrel of oil _ $12.60. That included soup, salad,
chicken and dessert.''
   The special was a hit two years ago, with people making
reservations because they thought they were getting a better price
for lunch, he said.
   Zimmerman said he loses money on the special but brought it back
to generate business.

   A teen-ager who required 110 stitches
after a shark attack in southeastern Australia said Friday that his
surfing days are over.
   Murray Taylor, 15, said the ``huge shark'' dragged him from his
surfboard and bit him repeatedly.
   Murray said he escaped by punching the shark on the nose and
trying to gouge its eyes. The attack occurred Thursday at Moana
Beach, 30 miles south of Adelaide.
   ``When he reached the shore he actually walked up the beach on
his own,'' said Murray's mother, Wendy Richardson. ``Murray said he
wasn't sure how big the shark was, but he said its head was at
least a foot wide.''
   The teen-ager was recuperating at Flinders Medical Center in
Adelaide.

   A woman who defied a court order to
stop feeding pigeons has been fined $234, the national news agency
TT reported Friday.
   The woman and a friend were accused of attracting the messy
birds to the small town of Matfors, 240 miles north of Stockholm.
The news agency did not give their names.
   The women were fined $78 each in February for feeding pigeons in
a residential area, the report said. One woman disregarded the
order to stop, angering residents who complained the pigeons were
polluting buildings and playgrounds. She was hauled back to court
and fined another $156 dollars, TT said.
   ``We inspected the area several times since 1985 and concluded
there was a clear nuisance,'' the local environment and health
official Peter Gavelin said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newsweek magazine is offering early retirement
to 100 employees, or 10 percent of its work force, because of
higher costs and a shrinking advertisement base, a spokesman said
today.
   ``The program is entirely voluntary,'' said spokesman Gary
Gerard. ``It's not draconian in any way.''
   Gerard said 100 fulltime employees _ those with 25 years or more
of service or those age 55 and older with 10 years at the magazine
_ received letters detailing the offer.
   He said it includes pension enhancement and continuation of some
insurance benefits. The size of the package will vary depending on
the employees' age and length of service.
   The weekly magazine's revenues were up 1 percent during the
first half of 1988 and Gerard said domestic circulation was at an
``all time high of 3.3 million.''
   However, the number of domestic ad pages has dropped 6 percent
from a year ago.
   ``Obviously, our costs have gone up substantially, primarily
postage and paper, and the advertising environment has become
increasingly competitive,'' said Diana Pearson, a magazine
spokeswoman. ``It forces us to operate in as lean and smart a way
as we can.''
   Gerard said 60 percent of those offered early retirement were on
the business side of the magazine and the rest were editorial
employees.

   Three railway employees were killed and
at least six people were seriously injured when an express train
ran off the track, the official BTA news agency said Friday.
   BTA said seven cars and the engine of the train, running between
the capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Varna, derailed as
the train entered a local station about 50 miles northeast of Sofia.
   The accident Thursday night was due to a ``wrongly prepared
route,'' BTA said without further explanation.
   Six people were hospitalized in serious condition in the city of
Pleven, BTA said. It did not say how many people were in the train
that derailed.
   The accident came a week after a government commission blamed
negligence and gross violations of discipline for summer plane and
train crashes in which 39 people died.
   Four top transportation officials were fired last week.
   On Aug. 2, a plane crash at Sofia's airport killed 29 people. A
train crash just outside Sofia on Sept. 14 killed 10 people.

<HEAD>Seaga Lowers Hurricane Damage Estimate to $1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LLOYD WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert caused $818 million
to $1 billion damage to Jamaica, less than previously estimated,
Prime Minister Edward Seaga said.
   The prime minister originally estimated Gilbert caused $8
billion in damage when it slammed into the Caribbean island with
130 mph winds Sept. 12.
   In a report to Parliament on Thursday, Seaga said Jamaica
already has raised enough money from other countries to finance
immediate emergency needs.
   He said about $515 million was received or pledged by other
countries and international financial institutions for rebuilding
the ravaged economy, including a $125 million pledge from the
United States.
   The government's latest reports said 45 people were killed when
the hurricane ripped the length of the island, severely damaging or
destroying half of its 500,000 homes and wiping out hundreds of
acres of banana, coconut and citrus crops.
   Seaga noted that $1 billion is almost 80 percent of what the
country gets in foreign-exchange earnings annually.
   ``To find up to $1 billion for hurricane emergency relief is in
effect to embark on a program to almost double the value of
foreign-exchange earnings in one year,'' which would normally be a
seven or 10-year goal, Seaga said.
   ``This target, however, is required not in seven to 10 years,
but in seven to 10 days,'' he said.
   Later, on radio and television, Seaga told Jamaicans he had set
a Christmas deadline ``to break the back of the rebuilding
program.''
   ``By no means all the work will be completed by then,'' he said.
``But hopefully comfort will be restored to those who are
shelterless, farmers will be in the field and the lights will shine
again.''
   He said the pledges from other countries and institutions such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will finance
the government's emergency spending, but more money will be needed
for the private sector.
   ``The financial picture, therefore, is one of good order, with
the necessary funding in place to finance the emergency and normal
operations of the country for the entire fiscal year,'' Seaga said.
   Relief organizations say tons of donated food and other relief
supplies are being distributed and consumed almost as soon as they
arrive from abroad, but much more is needed to feed and shelter
tens of thousands of people.

   Forty percent of China's policemen have had less
than 10 years of schooling, and police must be better educated, the
nation's top public security official said.
   Public Security Minister Wang Fang said on Thursday that many
police have no professional training, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. Wang spoke at the Chinese People's Univesity of
Police Officers, which has an enrollment of 1,500.
   Wang said 100,000 public security employees are taking classes
at correspondence schools and night schools or studying on their
own. About 90,000 more were trained at special colleges and
vocational schools in the past decade, he said.
   Officials blame low educational levels for police problems such
as taking bribes, extorting money and gaining confession by torture.
   In the first half of 1988 more than 2,100 policemen were
punished for abuse of power.

   Two bombs, one apparently aimed
at Jewish people and the other at leftists, exploded and caused
damage but no injuries, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday's
bombings.
   The first bomb exploded in the street in front of an exchange
house in the financial district, shattering windows and plaster.
   Exchange house owner Miguel Salcido said pamphlets reading
``Jews Stop Exploiting the Country'' and ``More Jews, Fewer
Australs'' were found nearby. The austral is the Argentine unit of
currency.
   The second explosion, in the working class suburb of William
Morris, destroyed a small concrete monument to two Montonero
leftist guerrillas killed in a shootout with police in 1970.
   The Montoneros, who kidnapped and killed former President Gen.
Pedro Aramburu in 1970, were virtually wiped out by security forces
by the mid-1970s.

<HEAD>Bush Attacks Dukakis on Crime; Democrats Still Crowing Over Debate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis comment in top 3 grafs, picking up in
2nd graf pvs, Quayle himself</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush renewed his attack today on
Massachusetts' prisoner-furlough program, saying Gov. Michael
Dukakis lacks compassion for crime victims. Dukakis said he would
keep up his criticism of Dan Quayle as a potential president and of
Bush for choosing him as running mate.
   Dukakis, commenting today as he campaigned in Missouri, said
there are two issues: whether GOP vice presidential nominee Quayle
is qualified to be president and whether Bush has good judgment.
   ``I'm going to hit it and hit it hard,'' he said.
   Quayle himself said today he was not worried about new
television ads questioning his worthiness for high office. He said
the Democrats' ads focusing on him mean ``they obviously don't have
anything bad to say about George Bush.''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, still
energized by what is widely seen as his debate victory over Quayle
Wednesday night, made fun of Bush's comments that Quayle had done
well.
   ``And yet every poll showed we won, and I'd say `George ...
facts are very troubling things,''' Bentsen said.
   Dukakis was campaigning in Missouri and North Carolina today,
after telling a Memphis, Tenn., audience Thursday night, ``There
are, as we know, going to be major changes in the Supreme Court. Do
you want the man who selected Dan Quayle to be making those
appointments?''
   When the 41st president takes office in January, three of the
justices will be over 80 _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and Harry A. Blackmun. Bush has said the next president ``will very
possibly appoint two or three justices to the Supreme Court, where
they'll sit well into the next century.''
   Bush was in Xenia, Ohio, concentrating on crime and declaring
that ``on no other issue is my opponent's philosophy so completely
at odds with mine, and I would say with the common sense attitudes
of the American people.''
   ``While the governor has shown great compassion for the
difficulties of prisoners and their families _ and no doubt their
hardships are severe _ when it comes to the plight of the victims
and their families, there is what one can only describe as an
astounding lack of sensitivity, a lack of human compassion,'' Bush
said in remarks prepared for delivery to law enforcement officials.
   He said Dukakis should have apologized to a Maryland couple who
were attacked by convicted murderer Willie Horton who had been
granted a weekend Massachusetts furlough in 1986. Dukakis has
called the incident ``a tragic occurrence.''
   Quayle, in Chattanooga, Tenn., was asked by reporters as he
toured a technical school whether he had become the key issue in
the campaign.
   ``We can stand the attention. We can stand the heat,'' he said.
``George Bush is going to be the next president of the United
States. The voters will vote for him.''
   In Dallas, Texas Sen. Bentsen said his debate with Quayle might
eventually be seen as ``a turning point'' in the campaign.
   Bentsen renewed his criticism of Quayle for trying to compare
his experience to that of John F. Kennedy in 1960. Bentsen listed
Kennedy's pre-presidency accomplishments, including his war record
and his winning of a Pulitzer Prize, and said a comparison of
Quayle and Kennedy was an ``incredible misfit.''
   Dukakis pressed his direct attack on Quayle _ and indirect
criticism of Bush's decision-making ability _ with new television
commercials portraying the Indiana senator as unfit for the vice
presidency.
   Bush, who barely mentioned Quayle during campaign appearance
earlier in the day Thursday, told an evening rally in Little Rock,
Ark., that Quayle proved himself in his Wednesday night debate.
   ``He did an outstanding job and he has been unfairly pounded by
my opponents,'' Bush said. ``And last night, last night, the
country saw what I have seen all along _ a young, knowledgeable,
experienced American and I am proud to have put my trust in a whole
generation of young people.''
   Bush's best known surrogate _ President Reagan _ said, ``I
really think that Quayle actually, just by the whole nature of the
event, headed off, or should have headed off, all this picking on
him that has been going on.''
   A second poll released Thursday supported the Democrats'
contention that Bentsen outshone Quayle in their debate. An CBS
News survey of 412 debate watchers found 50 percent believe Bentsen
won the debate to 27 percent for Quayle.
   The result was almost precisely the 51-27 percent split in an
ABC News poll taken immediately after the debate ended.
   The CBS poll also found that half the voters still doubt
Quayle's qualifications to serve as president, if the need arose.
Quayle was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent while
Bentsen was rated as qualified by 78 percent.
   In his first appearance in Fort Worth, Texas, Bush failed to
mention Quayle's debate performance. Instead, the Republican
nominee proposed doubling the nation's spending on new prison
construction and instituting a Justice Department anti-gang unit to
work with local jurisdictions.
   The Democratic nominee described Quayle's performance as
``programmed beyond belief,'' and said the Indiana senator seemed
``extremely insecure.'' Dukakis told Bentsen, ``Great work, again.''
   The Dukakis campaign, meanwhile, released a pair of television
ads belittling Quayle. One commercial notes that one in five vice
presidents have been thrust into the presidency while an announcers
says, ``After five months of reflection, George Bush made his
personal choice _ J. Danforth Quayle. Hopefully, we will never know
how great a lapse of judgment that really was.''
   In the second ad, part of the ``Packaging of George Bush''
series, so-called Bush campaign advisers discuss the selection of
Quayle. ``We've got a disaster on our hands,'' says one adviser.
Another wonders if the ticket can still dump Quayle and ``bring in
Bob Dole.''

   The four-party governing coalition
Friday survived its fourth motion of no-confidence since taking
office 17 months ago.
   Conservative Prime Minister Harri Holkeri's government, which
includes the Social Democrats, the Rural Party and the Swedish
People's Party, won the vote 123-64, with 12 members absent.
   The motion criticized the government's tax reform plans and the
1989 budget proposals, which the opposition said favored the rich.
   The main opposition Center Party, which has been gaining support
in opinion polls since the last election, charges the government
has not done enough for students and the poor.
   A survey published last month indicated growing disillusionment
with the government.
   The survey showed that the Conservatives and the Social
Democrats had only 40 percent support, down from 47 percent in the
March 1987 election.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today he would
continue to slam Republican Dan Quayle as unfit for the vice
presidency and depict rival George Bush as weak for selecting the
Indiana senator. ``I'm going to hit it and hit it hard,'' he said.
   Dukakis said the Quayle issue is double-edged: Is Quayle
qualified to be president and does Bush have any judgment?
   ``Strong presidents look for strong vice presidents,'' Dukakis
said Thursday, showering praise on Lloyd Bentsen and offering
ridicule for Quayle.
   ``Weak candidates look for something else.''
   Dukakis took the attack a step further in Memphis, telling a
rally in a renovated theater: ``There are as we know, going to be
major changes in the Supreme Court. Do you want the man who
selected Dan Quayle to be making those appointments?''
   The Massachusetts governor was campaigning today in Missouri and
North Carlina, both regarded as closely contested states, before
returning home to Boston for the evening.
   Dukakis belittled Republican Quayle in Tennessee after flying in
from tiny Lone Star in East Texas where he joined Bentsen for their
first appearance following the vice presidential debate in Omaha.
   After earlier describing Quayle as seeming ``extremely
insecure'' and ``programmed beyond belief'' in his televised
confrontation, Dukakis said the comparison with Bentsen was hving
an immediate effect on the Democratic ticket.
   ``I think it's one of the reasons why people are switching, why
this campaign of ours is starting to win,'' he told reporters after
arriving in Memphis.
   In Texas, before heading off on their separate ways on the
campaign trail, Dukakis looked ahead to his final remaining debate
with Bush next week in Los Angeles as he said goodbye to Bentsen on
an airport tarmac.
   ``Great work, again,'' Dukakis told the Texas senator. ``I'll
see if I can approach it.''
   The Dukakis campaign moved swiftly to begin airing a pair of
television commercials belittling Quayle. The ads were produced
before the debate and contain no reference to Bentsen's stinging
retort to Quayle _ ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.'' But the
campaign did not air the ads until after the debate, confident of
the wide perception Bentsen had done well and that Quayle had not
put to rest questions about himself.
   One ad, the latest in a series of mock depictions of Bush
campaign advisers, has one voice saying of Quayle, ``We've got a
disaster on our hands.'' Another suggests that Bush dump Quayle
from the ticket and ``bring in Bob Dole.''
   A second ad hits even harder. It shows photographs of Harry
Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford being sworn in as accidental
presidents while an announcer says one in five vice presidents have
been thrust into the presidency.
   ``After five months of reflection, George Bush made his personal
choice _ J. Danforth Quayle,'' an announcer says. ``Hopefully we
will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.''
   Dukakis senior adviser Francis O'Brien said both were airing on
networks nationally and would run for four or five days.
   Dukakis's assault on Quayle reflects Democratic hopes that
reservations about the 41-year-old Indiana senator's
qualifications, depth and fitness for the job are so great they
will overcome historical indicators that suggest a candidate's
running mate has little effect on voters' decisions.
   In Memphis, Dukakis southern coordinator Larry Harrington said
the ads and the Quayle issue could be important in states where
Dukakis and Bentsen are running extremely close with Bush.
Campaigning with Dukakis, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore _ a former
presidential candidate himself _ described Tennessee as just such a
``neck-and-neck'' state.
   ``It's never going to be a killer issue, but as long as it's
something they've got to deal with, in a state that's within one or
two (percentage) points, it can make a difference,'' Harrington
said.

   A weeping James L. Harvey pleaded guilty
today to six counts of kidnapping in the Feb. 2 takeover of a
private school and was sentenced to one life term, plus five
20-year terms.
   Harvey clutched a red-bound Bible as Circuit Judge John M. Karrh
of Tuscaloosa asked him how he pleaded to each count. Harvey nodded
and said softly, ``Guilty.''
   The pleas came in the third day of Harvey's trial on 110 counts
of kidnapping. The other counts were dropped in exchange for his
guilty pleas. He could have faced up to 10,000 years in prison.
   Karrh told Harvey his sentences would run concurrently and that
he would recommend Harvey get psychiatric treatment in the prison
system.
   ``I think you need treatment,'' the judge told Harvey, who sat
in a chair during the sentencing.
   Harvey had been charged with kidnapping 110 people at gunpoint
at the West End Christian School in Tuscaloosa. Harvey had been
defending himself in state court here as a crusader for people's
constitutional rights.
   A second man, described by police as an unwilling accomplice,
testified Thursday he was duped by Harvey into helping take over
the school and later was threatened with his life if he tried to
back out.
   Two of Harvey's sisters, Doris Elliott and Martha Gray, both of
Tuscaloosa, had met with him last night and today to try to talk
him into pleading guilty.
   ``I begged him to go to prison,'' Mrs. Gray said. ``At least he
will have part of his life.''
   She said her brother was mentally and physically exhausted. She
said he was suffering from a cold and had lost 20 pounds in the
eight months since the school takeover.
   Sheriff Joe Patterson of Tuscaloosa County, who with five of his
deputies guarded Harvey during the sentencing, said Harvey would be
returned to Tuscaloosa by Tuscaloosa County authorities for
transfer to prison.

   Beneath the surface of the northern
Russian landscape, a few miles from ancient churches and grazing
cattle, lies the blunt white tip of nuclear destruction.
   The SS-11 intercontinental missile has not intruded on the
outside world in the 15 years or more since it was placed in its
silo 150 miles northeast of Moscow.
   But it retains the power to destroy New York, Los Angeles or any
other American city in minutes.
   ``This missile is on full military standby. It's fully armed,''
Major Gen. Ivan Vershkov said Thursday on a trip sponsored by the
Soviet Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. The Soviet decision
to show the missile to foreign reporters was unprecedented.
   ``Your presence here is indeed a step toward trust,'' he said.
``If someone five years ago told me a group of correspondents,
including foreign correspondents, would meet me by a missile silo,
I wouldn't have believed it.'' The single-warhead SS-11 is among
the oldest of the Soviet strategic forces. Western military
references list three types of SS-11s and estimate the Soviets have
deployed about 440.
   The U.S. Defense Department says their range is 6,600 to 8,000
miles, putting any intercontinental target within their reach.
   The missile is based at what Western analysts call the Teykovo
missile range, surrounded by the historic towns of Suzdal, Rostov,
Yaroslavl, whose ancient churches remind one of life centuries
before nuclear weapons.
   Vershkov said residents know only that a military installation
is in the area.
   Soviet military officers said the decision to show the missile
was made by the general staff of Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the
Soviet military chief, within days of a reporter's query. The
officers said they learned of the visit six days before it began.
   Akhromeyev was shown a U.S. Minuteman II missile in the United
States this summer. Vershkov, a 49-year-old veteran of Soviet
rocket forces, said reporters were shown an SS-11 because it is
analogous to the Minuteman II.
   U.S. officials have visited more than 100 missile sites while
monitoring Soviet compliance with the treaty eliminating medium-and
shorter-range missiles, which was ratified in May.
   ``I wouldn't have thought we would have gone through 115
inspections, poking into sensitive areas, without some kind of
minor tension,'' Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of the U.S. Arms
Control Inspection Agency, said Tuesday. ``I find the Soviets
uncommonly flexible and supportive.''
   But Vershkov made clear that many questions about the SS-11
missile, the command center, and the soldiers who man it were
forbidden.
   Reporters were taken to the top of one silo, whose dark green
lid about 20 feet square was rolled to one side to uncover the
white SS-11 inside, and to an empty silo about nine miles away.
   They saw the top of the 60-foot missile, but not the command
center, which Vershkov said was several miles away. They saw no
soldiers except for a small group of top officers.
   Even officers in the control center don't know where the
missiles are targeted, he said.
   Vershkov, a Communist Party member who lavished praise on Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foreign policy, refused to detail his
responsibilities except to say he was a representative of the
military command.
   When a television reporter asked how close a nuclear missile
would have to land to destroy the site, he responded, ``Why do your
viewers need such details?''
   Western references say the first SS-11s were deployed in 1966
and that only about 20 remain. The rest are two later variations,
one with a single warhead and one with three warheads, deployed
betweeen 1973 and 1975.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are making slow progress in
negotiations to halve their arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons.
   The general said he and his soldiers would not be upset if the
SS-11s were destroyed under a new treaty.
   ``I'll find work. I have an engineering degree, and the country
needs working hands,'' he said.
   ``We don't intend to attack or threaten anyone,'' he said. ``I
am sure the remaining missiles would ensure defense sufficiency _
but the fewer of them, the better.''

<HEAD>Business Leaders Expect Slowdown In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's business leaders, enjoying
high profits from the strongest economic growth in four years, said
Friday they expect a slowdown in 1989.
   Executives ranging from Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed to
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith said their industries
are generating very strong earnings.
   Nevertheless, members of the Business Council, composed of 62
chief executives of large U.S. corporations, say they would prefer
less robust growth and a ``soft landing'' next year to the
alternative: higher inflation, rising interest rates and finally a
recession, or a ``hard landing.''
   Reed, delivering a consensus report of about 20 economists from
member corporations, told executives gathered for their
twice-a-year retreat at this mountain resort town to expect growth,
as measured by the gross national product, of 4 percent this year,
the best since 1984.
   The panel expects the current economic expansion, now in its
70th month, to continue well into next year, but at a slower rate.
   It predicted GNP growth of 2.5 percent in 1989 and less than 2
percent in 1990, about in line with what the Federal Reserve
considers non-inflationary.
   ``I think probably the general consensus would be 2.5 to 3 in
the longer term may be more healthy and more sustainable,'' Reed
said.
   Too much growth, according to economists, leads to shortages of
both labor and factory capacity, which in turn leads to higher
wages and prices.
   The sector of the economy expected to slow the most is consumer
spending. Increasing sales of U.S. goods abroad and more spending
on new machinery by manufacturers striving to meet the export boom
should replace consumption as the ``engine'' of the economy.
   Even executives who depend most heavily on consumer spending,
such as Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores
Inc., a major department store chain, welcome the shift because it
means fewer foreign imports.
   ``Retailers have as large a stake in the long-term health of the
economy as the manufacturing side,'' Hawley said. Soaring personal
consumption earlier in the 1980s ``clearly had long-range
implications for the economy that were not good.''
   Retail management simply needs to plan for slower growth, he
said.
   The executives, however, continue to be troubled about the
prospects for reducing the trade and budget deficits.
   Their economic advisers expect almost no progress through 1990
in shrinking the budget deficit from the 1987 level and expected a
1988 mark of about $150 billion.
   They forsee the trade gap declining from $170 billion last year,
to $134 billion this year and to below $100 billion in 1990. But
they say that will happen only with further declines in the value
of the dollar from the current level of 133 Japanese yen to 120 yen
over the next two years.
   Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., a health care
company, said only the continuing confidence of foreigners in the
United States, based on the past rather than the present, has kept
the value of the dollar artificially high.
   ``I'm persuaded ... that our trading partners and our creditors
will not tolerate forever the financial situation we're in. ...
Other countries wouldn't have gotten away this long without their
currency weakening a lot more than ours has,'' he said.
   In other predictions, the Business Council's economists saw:
   _Unemployment staying at 6 percent or below through 1990. The
rate was 5.4 percent last month, nearly the lowest in 14 years.
   _Consumer prices rising 4.2 percent this year and 5.1 percent
next year, but no return to the double-digit inflation of the late
1970s and early 1980s.
   _Average interest rates rising by a bit more than 1 percentage
point next year and then easing in 1990.
   The Business Council, formed in 1933 as an advisory panel to the
Department of Commerce, selected Smith of General Motors to serve
as its chairman in 1989 and 1990. He replaces S.D. Bechtel Jr.,
chairman of Bechtel Group Inc., a worldwide construction firm.

   Sudan said Friday it has stopped trying
to control a locust plague along the Ethiopian border because of
military attacks.
   The defense minister says no one has been hurt in the assaults
on villages and spray planes, but he said vehicles were burned in
an air attack on a convoy near Kassala, 260 miles east of Khartoum.
He said the government has asked the Ethiopian government to stop
the attacks.
   The episode appeared to be a major setback to Khartoum's efforts
to deal with one of Sudan's worst locust infestations in years.
   In Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, officials refused comment
on the situation.
   Relations between Sudan and Ethiopia have been strained for
several years, especially since a rebellion broke out in southern
Sudan in 1983.
   Sudan accuses Ethiopia of arming, financing and harboring the
rebels. Addis Ababa alleges that Khartoum allows several
anti-Ethiopian guerrilla groups to maintain official, open presence
in the Sudanese capital.
   The official Sudan News Agency said Syd Ali Mohamed Ali,
director of the Agriculture Ministry's Plant Protection Department
in eastern Sudan, announced the decision to abandon the frontier
spraying operation.
   ``All locust control operations along the Sudanese-Ethiopian
borders were completely halted due to the shelling of the pest
control areas by the Ethiopian air force,'' the news agency said.
   It quoted Ali as saying that sprayers and others involved with
the program already were withdrawn.
   Swarms of the crop-devouring insects appeared in several African
countries in recent weeks after heavy rains created perfect
breeding conditions.
   In Sudan, swarms have occurred mainly in the eastern and western
regions, but one massive swarm hit crops in the Khartoum area and
others are expected. The government committed 22 planes to the
spraying operation, but officials say three won't fly and one
crashed in the western sector.
   Ahmed Mahmoud Issa, minister of state at the Agriculture
Ministry, told the newspaper Al-Ayam that two Ethiopian MiG jet
fighters attacked vehicles assigned to the crop-dusting operation
in villages along the border. He said spray planes had come under
fire from within Ethiopia.
   The armed forces newspaper Al-Guwat Al-Musalaha confirmed the
reports on Thursday.
   ``The Ethiopian air force intercepted a locust spray convoy last
week in the eastern region ... and hit some cars working in the
spray operation,'' the newspaper said. ``No one was hurt.''
   Defense Minister Abdel-Meguid Hamid Khalil told Al-Guwat
Al-Musalaha the Foreign Ministry had relayed Sudan's demand that
Ethiopia ``stop violating Sudanese air space'' so that ``we work
together ... to eradicate locusts, which affect all the countries
in the region including Ethiopia.''

   Several thousand demonstrators chanted
Islamic slogans after Moslem prayer services today, and authorities
reported 900 arrests and an unspecified number of deaths in three
days of rioting.
   Police and troops were blocking the demonstrators, estimated by
reporters to number at least 6,000, in the Belcourt district in
eastern Algiers.
   They chanted ``God is Great'' and other slogans and called for
establishment of an Islamic republic.
   Earlier today, Algerians formed long lines for bread after an
overnight curfew that was almost universally obeyed. On Thursday,
the government declared a national state of emergency and put all
police and administrative authorities under the military.
   Occasional gunshots broke the early morning silence. It was not
clear whether the shots were fired at protesters or were warnings
to chase away the few people in the streets.
   Protesters this week have included youths protesting an
austerity program that has sharply increased prices, Islamic
fundamentalists who oppose the government's secular orientation and
rioters whose political stance was not known.
   The military command said 900 people were arrested in the three
previous days and were caught ``red-handed in pillage and
vandalism.'' In a separate statement, the command said street
battles caused ``losses of human life among the demonstrators as
well as in the ranks of the forces of order.''
   It said the deaths occurred Thursday during the day and night.
It did not say where in Algiers they happened.
   More than 30 people seriously injured in the clashes were
admitted to Mustapha Hospital in Algiers, medical sources said
today on condition of anonymity. They said the worst injuries
occurred Wednesday night.
   President Chadli Bendjadid proclaimed a state of emergency on
Thursday and ordered a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m.
   The army was given responsibility for public order for the first
time since Algeria won independence from France 26 years ago.
   Bakeries were among the few shops open today, as other food
stores remained closed either for lack of supplies or for fear of
renewed violence. While prices of meats and other goods have
soared, bread remains heavily subsidized by the government.
   Army convoys escorted trucks carrying flour to bakeries early in
the morning to assure supplies.
   ``Getting provisions to the citizens is one of our main
concerns, along with security,'' an army officer on one of the
escorts told The Associated Press. He declined to give his name.
   The national airline Air Algerie announced today it was
canceling all its flights, but international airlines continued to
operate flights in and out of Algiers' Houari Boumediene airport.
   Government offices and other businesses were closed as usual
today, the Moslem day of prayer.
   Former President Ahmed Ben Bella, who lives in exile in Geneva,
was quoted in the Paris daily Le Figaro as saying some people were
killed in the disturbances, without specifying how many or
providing details.
   ``It was predictable that young people would rise up against the
corruption, the bad management and the total lack of freedom,'' Ben
Bella, who was president from independence in 1962 until he was
overthrown in a military coup in 1965, was quoted as saying.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported that two
brothers, aged 14 and 23, were killed in the El-Biar neighborhood
and quoted a relative as saying she saw their bodies at the
Birtraria hospital.
   A hospital official, refusing to identify himself, denied the
report today.
   The protests began last week with a series of strikes in
industries _ which are nearly all government-controlled _ as well
as the postal and telephone service and Air Algerie.
   By unofficial estimates, unemployment is above 40 percent in the
capital.
   Under the government's economic reform program, prices for basic
food staples other than bread have risen sharply. Slightly more
than two pounds of beef sell for $25 or more.

   Nine prison inmates who grew marijuana
while on work details in a forest were caught trying to smuggle 31
pounds of pot into a state prison work camp, Oregon State Police
said today.
   The inmates had been cultivating the marijuana in an area where
they were supposed to be planting trees, state police Sgt. Michael
D. Stephenson said. A state prison work vehicle carrying the
inmates was returning from a work area near Jewell when it was
stopped late Tuesday outside the South Fork Prison Camp by state
police and Tillamook County sheriff's deputies acting on a tip.
Inside the vehicle they found two duffle bags containing 31 pounds
of marijuana.
   The inmates offered no resistance but one prisoner tried to
swallow ``his stash'' and had to be taken to Tillamook County
General Hospital for removal of marijuana that had lodged in his
throat, Stephenson said.
   The inmates were charged with manufacturing a controlled
substance, possession of more than one ounce of marijuana and
supplying contraband, he said.

   John Denver says he has until Nov. 1 to
accept a ``very serious'' invitation to fly aboard a Soviet
spacecraft.
   ``This is not a stunt to me. ... I think that it's the best
thing that I can do right now for my country, for NASA, for our
space effort, for our people and for the planet,'' the ``Rocky
Mountain High'' singer said Thursday.
   However, Denver said the Soviets' insistence that he pay $10
million for the flight would likely prompt him to drop the project.
   ``I've told them that I'm opposed to paying $10 million, that I
think it's inappropriate, that I think it's negative and that it's
not the way I want to pursue this endeavor,'' he said.
   Among the Soviet requirements that Denver said he has fulfilled
is obtaining permission from the U.S. government and passing a
physical for space flight with NASA.
   ``At this point they have a slot open for me, December of next
year,'' he said.

   Retiring Sen. William Proxmire says he's had
some discussions with the National Taxpayers Union about continuing
his trademark Golden Fleece awards, but that their future is still
up in the air.
   The monthly awards publicize what the feisty Wisconsin Democrat
considers a waste of government money.
   ``I've talked with the National Taxpayers Union but nothing has
been decided,'' Proxmire said Thursday. ``No individual could do it
without staff help unless he spent full time on it, and I don't
want to spend all my time on Golden Fleeces.''
   Proxmire, 71, who did not seek re-election this year, said when
it comes time to clear out his office in January, he'll move over
to the Library of Congress. The library offers office space to all
retiring senators but requires that they spend at least 16 hours a
week there.
   ``I'll have a desk and a typewriter _ and access to the best
research facilities on the face of the Earth,'' said Proxmire, who
plans to write on topics such as the national debt and employment.
   The senator also noted the new space will probably be ``a
quarter of the size of my office in the Senate.''

   A proud Prince Andrew calls his 2-month-old
daughter, Beatrice, ``quite extraordinary.''
   ``She is really very alert and does not make much noise,'' the
Duke of York said of his first child, born Aug. 8 to him and his
wife, the former Sarah Ferguson. ``She has Sarah's eyes and I am
convinced she is going to be prettier than both of us.''
   He said Beatrice's hair continually changed color, some days red
like her mother's, some days not.
   ``I don't think she is going to be as red as people think,'' he
told Press Association, the British domestic press agency, in an
interview published Thursday.
   Andrew brushed aside criticism from the Australian and British
media that he and his wife should have brought the infant on a
recent tour of Australia.
   ``If they bothered to think about it for one second, Beatrice is
much better off at home where things are stable,'' he said.

   James F. Neal, who successfully
prosecuted Watergate figures H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and
John Mitchell, said his first encounter with cameras in the
courtroom left him with stage fright.
   ``I was terrified,'' said Neal, but added that it took him only
a day to get comfortable with the medium.
   The attorney told the American Society of Newspaper Editors on
Thursday that his first experience with cameras in the courtroom
came in 1986, when he successfully defended film director John
Landis and four other men charged with involuntary manslaughter.
   The charges stemmed from the 1982 deaths of actor Vic Morrow and
two children who were killed on the set of ``Twilight Zone: The
Movie'' when a helicopter crashed onto them.
   ``I now have no hesitation in having a camera in the courtroom
at any time, and if you're the kind of lawyer that you should be, I
think you ignore it,'' Neal said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Quentin Burdick used to offer a
karate chop for anyone saying the 80-year-old senator was too old
to run for re-election. The karate line is gone, but Burdick still
argues he's fit despite his advancing age and a recent cancer
operation.
   The 28-year Democratic Senate veteran maintains a comfortable
lead over Republican opponent Earl Strinden, who argues that the
issue is Burdick's ``ability to be a vigorous U.S. senator for the
next six years.''
   ``I'm in good shape,'' counters Burdick. ``I'm surprising
myself.''
   A University of North Dakota poll taken in late September gave
Burdick a 57 percent to 32 percent lead over Strinden but indicated
that 35 percent of eligible voters were concerned about his mental
and physical fitness.
   Part of Strinden's problem appears to be his personality. Even
people who like the 56-year-old House majority leader say he's
abrasive. Some 37 percent of North Dakotans view Strinden
unfavorably, according to an earlier poll.
   ``I've taken many stands over the years that have at that moment
in time been unpopular,'' said Strinden. ``I'm a fighter. I've
always been a fighter.''
   A series of television commercials intended to soften Strinden's
image as an overbearing leader made little difference, and now
Burdick has started a series of attacks on the Republican's record
on farm and social service issues.
   Strinden accuses Burdick of dodging face-to-face meetings with
him and says a pair of debates later this month, when the senator
must speak extemporaneously, will demonstrate whether he has the
stamina for another six-year term.
   So far, though, Burdick has kept his distance, saying his work
in the Senate, where he is chairman of the Environment and Public
Works Committee, is taking up his time.
   ``I've got to finish my job down there,'' Burdick said in a
recent interview at the Bismarck airport. ``I can't leave.''
   Burdick has limited his campaigning primarily to television and
has turned down numerous invitations for joint appearances with his
challenger.
   When the two candidates were asked to speak at a meeting of the
state's broadcasters, Strinden showed up, but Burdick sent his
press secretary and a video-taped speech.
   Burdick has been hospitalized twice in the last year, once for a
concussion when he slipped on ice last winter and hit his head, and
again last summer when doctors removed 18 inches of his intestine
after a cancerous polyp was discovered.
   Several leading Democrats first raised the age issue last year
in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to retire, and Republicans
have picked up where Burdick's Democratic critics left off.
   Strinden is pinning his hopes on winning over Democrats and
independents who have doubts about Burdick's fitness. ``There's a
sizable number of people out there supporting him who really don't
think he should run again,'' said Strinden.
   Some 26 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of independents
polled in late September were concerned about his age.
   ``It still could be an issue, but not the kind of issue that the
Strinden campaign hoped that people would hook onto,'' said Phil
Harmeson, who conducts the UND surveys. After all, this is a state
that re-elected 77-year-old Milton Young in 1974; Young finally
retired, at 83.
   To highlight his own good health, Strinden once held a news
conference with his doctor, who told reporters that the Republican
candidate has gained a little weight and drinks too much coffee.
   Strinden has just $120,000 left in the bank after wasting, he
says, a similar amount on pre-October commercials, including an
$8,000 anti-drunken driving campaign.
   With so little money left, Strinden cannot afford to counter the
blitz of Burdick ads for which he is bracing, he said.
   Burdick has raised more than $1 million for his campaign and
still has about $400,000 left, says Carolyn Nelson, his campaign
treasurer.
   Strinden maintains that his campaign was right on track until
Burdick's surgery. The operation, from which Burdick appeared to
recover quickly, won the sympathy of voters and gave him a boost in
the polls, Strinden said.
   Burdick, who has challenged political opponents to spar with him
in a karate match if they doubt his health, started running a
vigorous media campaign soon after the 1986 election gave Democrats
control of the Senate and elevated him to the committee
chairmanship.
   Burdick says he will convince voters of his vigor when he gets
back to North Dakota. Congress was scheduled to adjourn this
weekend.
   ``They'll see me on TV, they'll see me in person. ... They can
see for themselves what shape I'm in,'' he said.

   Hundreds of unused needles in
protective plastic sheaths washed up along six`lles of beach, and

   The disposable needles were found Thursday from Riviera Beach to

   ``We don't think the needles are any kind of public health

Departgeit's environmental health division. No beaches were closed
because of the needles.
   The one-liter bags of a type used to hold blood taken for
transfusions had no hospital markings, authorities said. The
needles were sent to a state laboratory in Jacksonville to be
analyzed for clues to their manufacturer.
   ``We can only guess the needles were dumped from a passing

   Negotiators concluded another round of
talks on U.S. military bases in Greece without discussing a Greek
demand for the closure of an Air Force base at Athens Airport, a
government spokesman said Friday.
   The negotiators will meet again next month in Washington, he
said.
   The spokesman, Sotiris Kostopoulos, said American defense aid to
Greece was among issues discussed but that Greece's demand to close
the Air Force base ``wasn't especially touched upon.''
   Greece is insisting that Hellenikon base, where 1,400 Americans
are stationed, must be shut after the current bases agreement
expires in December.
   ``Different aspects were discussed, such as defense aid, ...and
the issue of principles to be included in the preamble to the
expected agreement,'' Kostopoulos said.
   Greece gets more than $430 million in U.S. military credits as a
form of rent for the bases.
   The government also is eager to maintain a longstanding
agreement under which Greece receives $7 in U.S. aid for every $10
that goes to Turkey.
   The ``issues of principle'' mentioned by Kostopoulos are
understood to involve a Greek request for the agreement to include
backing for Greek positions in disputes with fellow NATO-member
Turkey over control of the Aegean Sea.
   The United States operates four bases in Greece and about 20
smaller communications facilities around the country.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Tough New Ads: Better Late Than Never</HEAD>

   The new television-ad offensive by Democrat
Michael Dukakis against an already aggressive George Bush is weeks
late, campaign watchers say.
   Still, ``in a campaign as in life, better late than never,''
said Larry Sabato, an author and campaign specialist at the
University of Virginia.
   Dukakis, running slightly behind Republican Bush in most polls,
started a clutch of negative ads this week, including two that
question both the qualifications of GOP vice presidential nominee
Dan Quayle and Bush's judgment in choosing him.
   Each campaign is reported to be spending more than $1 million a
week on national network television time and more than twice that
much for ads on local stations and cable television. Bush is
planning a half-hour program on election eve; Dukakis is still
weighing options.
   Sabato and other analysts say Dukakis should have been on the
attack coming out of the Democratic convention last July, when Bush
first started airing ads criticizing the Massachusetts governor's
crime and environmental records.
   ``It's always easier to shape attitudes than to reshape them,''
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Texas professor and
author of three books on presidential campaigns in the TV age.
``These ads would have been much more effective if they had gone on
the air six weeks ago.''
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said Dukakis ``wanted to keep this
campaign on a positive note talking about the issues. Regrettably,
because of the nasty campaign they've been running, we've had to''
go negative.
   Sig Rogich, Bush's ad director, countered that the Dukakis team
is ``groping for ideas. ... Their ad team probably could be equated
with the same group given the task of selling the Edsel. The
American people just aren't going to buy it.''
   Jamieson and others have compared the Dukakis ad effort
unfavorably to the hard-hitting Bush strategy devised by Roger
Ailes. The Bush campaign has recently introduced tough ads
attacking Dukakis' prison furlough program, tax policies and other
aspects of his record as governor.
   Gearan indicated the Dukakis camp's remaining advertising would
build on the new get-tough attitude. ``There is definitely a
unified ad campaign that is planned,'' he said. ``So fasten your
seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy ride.''
   The new approach apparently bears the stamp of the candidate.
Asked in St. Louis if he had seen the new anti-Quayle ads his
campaign is running, Dukakis replied, ``Are you kidding me? Nothing
goes on around here without me knowing.''
   The Dukakis team kicked into high gear early this week with a
nationally aired ``Packaging of George Bush'' series in which
actors playing cynical Bush handlers moan about how to disguise
their candidate's alleged weaknesses on the environment, drugs,
crime and health matters.
   The ``packaging'' series was joined several days later by a set
of four ads hitting the vice president's record on drugs, the
environment, Social Security and education. A narrator derides
Bush's record on each issue and asks viewers if they really believe
he has converted to the cause.
   One of the Quayle ads shows scenes of vice presidents Harry
Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford taking their presidential
oaths as a narrator says one in five vice presidents has risen
directly to the presidency.
   ``For this job, after five months of reflection, George Bush
made his personal choice _ J. Danforth Quayle,'' the ad says.
``Hopefully, we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that
really was.''
   The other ad, part of the ``packaging'' series, shows the
actor-handlers depressed about the Indiana senator's debate showing
against the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen.
   ``We've got a disaster on our hands,'' one handler says.
   ``Suddenly the words `President Quayle' even make me nervous,''
says another.
   ``Is it too late to drop him?'' asks a third. ``Bring in Bob
Dole?''
   Bush went on national television this week with an ad
reiterating his soft-on-criminals charge against Dukakis. The spot
says Dukakis vetoed the death penalty and mandatory sentences for
drug dealers, and charges a ``revolving door'' prison furlough
program let out murderers who are still at large.
   Another, in spot markets around the country, accuses Dukakis of
imposing ``the largest tax increase in Massachusetts history'' and
spending ``at a greater per capita rate than any other governor in
America.''
   Both spots end, ``And now he wants to do for America what he's
done for Massachusetts. America can't afford that risk.''
   Another spot ad features complaints about Dukakis from
Massachusetts residents, according to Bush advertising aide Janet
Mullins. ``We got them off the street, literally,'' she said.
   ``Michael Dukakis should be called Michael Taxakakis,'' a man
says. ``I'm a Democrat. I've never voted Republican before, but
this time I'm voting for George Bush,'' says a woman.
   The Bush campaign won't discuss its TV spending, but the
opposition reports that Bush has bought or plans to spend $1.2
million to $1.5 million on national network time for each week up
to the election, and spent $2.5 million on local and cable outlets
this week. The Dukakis campaign says its spending is comparable to
the GOP outlay.

<TEXT>
   The nation's groundwater will appear more
contaminated in coming years simply because more people are looking
for contamination, the U.S. Geological Survey said Friday.
   Although evidence is insufficient to show whether contamination
is getting worse, groundwater quality is generally good, the agency
said.
   Groundwater provides drinking water for 53 percent of the U.S.
population _ 97 percent in rural areas _ and accounts for 40
percent of the flow in the nation's streams.
   Contamination has attracted increasing concern in recent years,
and the survey devoted its annual water report for 1986, released
only Friday, to groundwater quality. Survey spokesman Don Finley
said ``printing problems'' had delayed the report.
   All states reported contamination from both natural and human
sources.
   In its report for 1984, the survey reported worrisome
contamination of groundwater by nitrate compounds, with nearly 20
percent of sampled wells showing evidence of nitrate additions from
human activity and 6 percent exceeding recommended maximum
concentrations.
   The data came not from a statistical sample, but rather a search
of files for the previous 25 years, and the percentages would not
necessarily apply to the nation's groundwater supply as a whole.
   A special study ofencies, the extent of groundwater
contamination is likely to appear to increase over the next few
years because more agencies will be searching for evidence of
contamination, and they will be using increasingly sensitive
analytical procedures.'''
   Groundwater moves slowly, only a few feet per year at most, so
contamination can take years to show up in wells near a pollution
site.
   In some instances, officials said, remedial measures may be
cleaning the shallower parts of an aquifer even while contamination
is still penetrating to the deeper parts.

<HEAD>AIDS Not `Exploding' among Heterosexuals, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AIDS is not ``exploding'' among the nation's
heterosexuals, public health experts said in a report Friday, but
one researcher warned it's going to be a bigger problem for the
general public than many think.
   The report in the Journal of the American Medical Association
said the number of reported heterosexual AIDS cases is doubling
every 14 to 16 months, keeping pace with infection rates among
homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers.
   ``Although AIDS is not `exploding' into the heterosexual
population relative to other risk groups, the increase in the
number of heterosexual cases is proportional to increases in other
risk groups,'' the report said.
   Heterosexual spread of the deadly disease appears to be more of
a problem among blacks than whites, the researchers noted.
   About 4 percent of the 59,287 cases of AIDS reported in the
United States between June 1981 and April 11, 1988, are listed as
heterosexually transmitted, according to the report.
   Blacks accounted for 69 percent of the 2,392 AIDS cases
attributed to heterosexual contact, whites accounted for 17 percent
and Hispanics 14 percent, the report said.
   A co-author, Dr. Harry W. Haverkos of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md., said a higher rate of drug abuse among
blacks might be a major factor in the increased frequency of
heterosexually transmitted AIDS among blacks.
   The report said intravenous drug abuse is ``an important link''
in the heterosexual spread of AIDS, with 61 percent of U.S.-born
heterosexual AIDS patients reporting sexual contact with an IV drug
abuser.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which cripples the immune
system, is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.
   ``Heterosexual spread of AIDS is going to be a bigger problem
than many people in this country up until now have suggested,''
Haverkos cautioned. ``The medical community and the public should
be aware of this and start developing ways to minimize
transmission.''
   The report reiterated that condoms offer the best protection
outside of abstinence to prevent the spread of AIDS, and it
recommended counseling for people infected with the virus to keep
them from spreading it to sex partners.
   Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield, director of the Sexually Transmitted
Disease Control Program for the Seattle-King County Department of
Public Health in Washington, said he basically agreed with the
report's findings, but felt the authors somewhat overstated the
potential problem of heterosexual AIDS cases.
   ``We clearly should prepare for the worst, but at the same time
the average heterosexual who is not being sexually active in an
environment of drug abuse is currently at a very low risk'' of
becoming infected, Handsfield said.
   A letter from three doctors at the Wisconsin Division of Health
in Madison appearing in the JAMA issue criticized a method used in
Illinois to control heterosexual transmission _ mandatory
premarital testing for the AIDS, or HIV, virus _ as ineffective.
   The mandatory Illinois testing program spotted only five
HIV-positive people after testing nearly 45,000 marriage license
applicants during the first four months of 1988, according to Dr.
Edward Belongia and his colleagues.

   Nine inmates who were supposed to be
planting trees on a work detail had been cultivating marijuana and
were arrested trying to smuggle 31 pounds of their crop into
prison, State Police said Friday.
   The drugs were stuffed into two duffle bags that were found
Tuesday in a vehicle returning the inmates from a forest near
Jewell, said Sgt. Michael D. Stephenson.
   One prisoner tried to swallow ``his stash'' and was taken to
Tillamook County General Hospital for removal of marijuana lodged
in his throat, Stephenson said.
   Stephenson said police will consider closer supervision of the
inmates.
   ``The inmates are out in the woods, often going up hills with a
45-degree grade and I'm sure that they have the opportunity to
plant marijuana right along with the trees,'' he said.

   The Wildlife Ministry has fired 10 game
wardens and rangers and suspended 33 others in a campaign to stop
elephant poaching, newspapers reported Friday.
   Wild game hunting is banned in Kenya, but poachers kill
elephants for their valuable ivory tusks and are decimating Kenya's
elephant herds.
   Ivory tusks sell for $82 a pound. Much of the ivory smuggled
from Kenya ends up in the Far East, where it is carved into jewelry
and figurines.
   ``If they have broken the law, they will be prosecLeakey, assistant
minister for tourism and wildlife, told
Parliament on Thursday. Leakey's comments were reportuted,'' Philip

   He said the 10 rangers and game wardens dismissed had been
working in Tsavo, Masai Mara and Amboseli national parks.
Twenty-nine game wardens and four rangers also have been
interdicted pending further investigations, said Leakey.
   ``We have sacked them and investigations are ongoing,'' he said.
``Every effort will be made to bring these people to justice.''
   It was unclear whether the 43 rangers and game wardens affected
by the move included the 33 officers of different ranks the
ministry suspended in September.
   Leakey said the ministry planned to intensify training programs
for wildlife officers in K come home, to bring his wife and two children
back to their own country, but his professional achievements and
aspirations had reached too high. So he set out to fulfill a new
dream: a world-class heart hospital in India. Now it has become a

<HEAD>Clock Runs Out on Child Care, Family Leave Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A package of family bills offering child care
assistance and parental job leaves died Friday in the Senate, a
casualty of political pressures and the ticking clock of the 100th
Congress.
   With adjournment expected next week and at least two major bills
still pending, sponsors of the legislation failed to get the 60
votes they needed to restrict debate and get on with their bill.
The vote was 50-46.
   The triple-pronged package _ which also included a crackdown on
child pornographers _ was on the Senate floor for the better part
of two weeks amid intense political and parliamentary maneuvering.
   Democrats repeatedly termed the package an opportunity to back
up election campaign rhetoric with a solid commitment. Republicans
said there were more pressing matters to deal with, such as drug
and tax bills, and they refused to offer amendments or strike a
compromise on the family measures.
   ``Their filibuster was successful. They have won today and
America's families have lost,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., said after the vote.
   Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the Senate had acted
prudently. ``What we've done in effect is say slow down,'' he said.
``This isn't an urgent measure that needs to be passed in the
waning days of the 100th Congress.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who led the drive for the
package, accused Republicans of waging ``a filibuster by silence;
nine days of stalling; nine days of total inertia.''
   ``Never in the history of American politics has there been a
constituency so popular but with so little political clout as the
American family,'' said Dodd, chairman of the Senate subcommittee
on children, family, drugs and alcoholism. He said he would
re-introduce the parental leave and child care bills on the first
day of the 101st Congress in January.
   The three elements of the family package included:
   _Dodd's original bill requiring employers of over 50 people to
offer workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave when
they have newborn, newly adopted or sick children, or have serious
medical problems themselves.
   _An anti-pornography measure sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., making it a federal crime to possess, sell or distribute
child pornography or obscene materials. It was added to the
parental leave bill on a unanimous vote.
   _The $2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care Services, also
sponsored by Dodd, aimed at helping low-income parents pay for
child care at centers or homes. It was presented as a compromise
between Dodd and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and was to have included
a tax credit for poor families in its final form.
   There remains considerable controversy over the bill's treatment
of religious groups providing day care, and over a requirement that
day care providers receiving federal money meet minimum federal
standards of health and safety, staff training and
staff-to-children ratios.
   The parental-leave section was fought vigorously by business and
conservative groups.
   ``The (Senate) debate focused on whether the private sector
rather than Congress is best equipped to decide and manage benefit
policy. It wasn't a debate on whether or not parental or medical
leave is a good benefit,'' said Mary Tavenner, founder of a group
called the Concerned Alliance of Responsible Employers.
   Groups that back the Dodd bills, representing unions, churches,
women, children and medical personnel, vowed to press ahead next
year.
   ``We're going to be back early so we're first on the agenda
instead of last in the next Congress,'' said Judith Lichtman,
executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund.
   ``People are going to be angry that there's been such a high
level of rhetoric and so little produced,'' said Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., sponsor of the parental leave bill in the
House. ``We'll be back stronger. It's not the end. It's the
beginning.''

   Oakland Community College has declared
a band of masked suspects innocent in the failure of a computer
system.
   Raccoons on the Highland Lakes campus initially were accused of
damaging the system Aug. 31 by entering tunnels and vandalizing a
computer cable.
   ``The preliminary diagnosis was that animals chewed through the
cable because it had happened before,'' college spokesman George
Cartsonis said. ``We knew from the droppings and chew marks they
had been there.''
   But an investigation found that maintenance workers had allowed
the cable to slip against hot-water pipes that melted part of the
cable, Cartsonis said.
   ``Just because raccoons wear masks doesn't mean they are always
the bad guys,'' he said. ``They got blamed for something they
didn't do.''

   Thomas Schaffner thinks the solution to voter
apathy is to follow the Chicago's maxim, ``Vote early and vote
often.''
   To promote his idea _ and sign up subscribers to his newsletter
about Chicago _ he is selling a Campaign '88 button that reads:
``Two ballots please ... I'm from Chicago.''
   With current and former Chicago residents picking up the slack
from apathetic voters, turnout could exceed 100 percent on Nov. 8,
said Schaffner, publisher of Chicago File, a newsletter for former
Windy City residents.
   He devoted the October issue to Chicago's history of unorthodox
get-out-the-vote techniques and its residents' commitment to
democracy.
   ``Many carry the `right to vote' all the way to their graves,
often unknowingly. Once there, they continue to faithfully cast
ballots for a good many years,'' wrote Schaffner.
   On Election Day, Schaffner advised: ``Proclaim yourself precinct
captain. ... Wear something official-looking and walk around your
neighborhood telling people who they should vote for. Don't forget
to invent some ugly rumors about your candidate's opponent.''
   ``Elections are Chicago's Mardi Gras,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 homeowners with leaky pipes have been
awarded up to $7 million in damages from the four companies that
made and installed the plumbing, ending a marathon trial that
produced a 4,465-page verdict.
   The state jury Thursday sided with 94 La Porte homeowners who
had sued General Homes Corp, which built the houses, Shell Oil Co.,
U.S. Brass Corp. and Hoechst-Celanese Corp., which produced and
marketed the plumbing materials.
   Ending a trial that began in June, the jury found that the four
companies were negligent and misrepresented the quality of the
plumbing.
   The plumbing apparently failed in many of the Fairmount Park
subdivision homes after about four years because of contact with
chemicals, primarily chlorine, found in water, said James R.
Moriarty, an attorney for the homeowners.
   Moriarty said the verdict, which addressed each claim on a
separate sheet of paper, was the first against the companies
responsible for the polybutylene plumbing system. Six similar suits
are pending in Harris County courts, he said.
   Moriarty said the jury awarded each homeowner about $40,000 to
$70,000 in damages, interest and fees, but the final amount depends
on whether Judge Alice Oliver Trevathan affirms the panel's finding
of deceptive trade practices.
   He said the plumbing system was taken off the market in 1986.

<DATELINE>REHOVOT, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of children were vaccinated
against polio Friday in the first stage of a nationwide campaign to
immunize all Israelis up to the age of 40 against the disease.
   The Health Ministry ordered the campaign after nine Israelis
were infected by polio, which causes muscular paralysis.
   In the next four weeks, about 3.2 million people will be
vaccinated, said ministry spokesman Shmuel Algrabli.
   Israelis are immunized as children, and the current vaccination
is a booster.
   The first stage of the campaign centered on the Tel Aviv suburb
of Rehovot and the northern coastal town of Acco. Polio viruses
were found in the sewage systems of both areas.
   In Rehovot, hundreds of parents lined up at clinics with their
infants. Large yellow wall posters informed residents when
different age groups should report for vaccinations.
   The Tourism Ministry expressed concern that reports of the
disease would keep visitors away from Israel.
   Tourism has dropped dramatically since the Palestinian uprising
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began Dec. 8.
   But Health Ministry officials have stressed visitors do not need
extra vaccinations before visiting the country because the outbreak
is limited.
   No cases of polio were reported in Israel last year, and the
recent cases have been blamed on overflowing sewage.
   The government initially decided to give booster vaccinations
only to residents of affected areas, but changed its policy
Thursday following recommendations by a team of international
health experts.
   Military officials said they would decide Sunday whether to
administer booster shots to Palestinians in the West Bank. No such
program is considered in the Gaza Strip.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands have routinely received the
combined Sabin-Salk vaccine, which is more effective than the
single vaccination administered in Israel.
   The stronger vaccine was given to counter often substandard
sanitary conditions in the occupied territories, such as open
sewage systems.
   ``The general situation in the West Bank is very good, but since
the vaccinations are being done in Israel we may administer
boosters,'' said Olivier Rafowicz, a spokesman for the West Bank
military government.

   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis, will join celebrities Saturday reading
the names of AIDS victims memorialized in a 750-by-500-foot quilt
to be laid out on the Elipse behind the White House.
   Chris Minor, an Atlanta native who made 20 of the quilts 8,288
panels in memory of friends who died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, said Mrs. Dukakis has helped the anti-AIDS movement in
San Francisco where the quilt project is based and participated in
a program to take meals to AIDS victims.
   Others among the 495 people scheduled to read names of victims
are actresses Shirley McClaine, Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth
McGovern and Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.
   The framework for the display, complete with 16 miles of canvas
walkway to allow an expected 250,000 spectators a closer view of
the quilt's panels, was laid out Friday. Each panel is 3-feet by
6-feet.
   Saturday's program, scheduled to begin at sunrise with the
reading of the first set of 32 names as the panels are being laid
out, is expected to last 11 hours, according to NAMES Project
spokesman Danny Sauro.
   Many of the volunteers became involved with the project after a
friend died of the disease. One group from Boston is selling
``travel kits'' of aspirin, condoms, safe sex pamphlets and combs.
   The travel kits, t-shirts, posters and a book about the life
stories behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the
costs of bringing the massive display to the capital.
   Panels not on the Elipse will be on display around the city at
various AIDS support group centers. American Red Cross
headquarters, across the street from the quilt, has an exhibit of
photographs of AIDS victims.
   Debra Resnik, who managed a 20-city tour for the quilt, expected
the reaction to the display, which is now the size of four football
fields, to be similar to what it received on the tour.
   ``It was incredible,'' she said. ``There was such an outpouring
of relief, of pain. Especially when we went to cities like Kansas
City, New Orleans, Baltimore, the really sheltered places where
(friends and relatives of AIDS victims) are so alone. You have a
place to go, to carry your grief.''
   Former actor Barry Singer, who has AIDS, agreed that the quilt
offers a chance to humanize the statistics. But he said it provokes
a number of emotions, including anger.
   ``There wouldn't have to be a quilt if there would have been
government intervention,'' he said. ``It is now up to the people to
realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the a
gay community dying from AIDS.''

   The nation's unemployment rate in September
fell back to July's level of 5.4 percent, but with the loss of
37,000 factory jobs in the meantime, the government said Friday.

14-year-low 5.3 percent.
   But more than 100,000 of the new jobs were an unusually high
number of teachers returning to the classroom. Payroll growth in
the private sector has averaged only 120,000 new jobs in each of
the past two months, compared with average monthly gains of 300,000
in the first half of 1988.
   The 0.2 percentage point drop in the September jobless rate
directly offset an increase of the same size, to 5.6 percent, in
August.
   Analysts said the figures indicate a continuing trend of slower
economic growth _ just what financial markets nervous about an
overheating economy and inflation wanted _ going into next month's
presidential election.
   ``If you were (Republican nominee) George Bush, I don't think
you could have written a better set of numbers,'' said David Wyss,
chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass.
   Wyss called the loss of 18,000 factory jobs last month following
a similar drop of 19,000 in August a concern but added: ``If you're
a Republican, you avoid the details and look at the big picture.''
   That's just what President Reagan did, citing the figures in a
campaign rally for Bush in Michigan as evidence that ``America's
economy is a Grand Prix racer.''
   However, there was other evidence in Friday's report that the
job picture is not as rosey as it appears at first glance.
   Construction employment was flat and oil and gas industry
rosters fell for the second month in a row. Together with
assembly-line employment growth, they had been providing an average
65,000 new jobs a month from January through July.
   Employment growth in business services such as data processing
that has provided a large chunk of the job gains in the 6-year-long
economic recovery also has slowed to a trickle the past two months,
the government said.
   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, told the
congressional Joint Economic Committee that as many industries lost
jobs last month as gained them, the first time that has occurred in
more than two years.
   Citing an unusual monthly drop of 107,000 people in the labor
force, Larry Mishel, an economist of the Economic Policy Institute,
a liberal think tank financed largely by labor unions, said Reagan
and Bush ``are getting lucky on the demographics.''
   ``The whole reason why Reagan has been able to achieve low
unemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a third
in the 1980s,'' Mishel said. ``President Carter had the Baby Boom
coming into the labor market and had to create a lot more jobs.
Reagan has enjoyed the effects of the Baby Bust.''
   Economists said they did not expect government economic reports
due to be released before the Nov. 8 election to help Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group, a consulting
firm based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., predicted that the employment,
inflation and trade figures all will paint a rosy economy.
   ``He's not going to get any help from the raw employment
figures,'' Chimerine said of Dukakis. ``If he's going to win on
economics, it's going to have to come from convincing people
there's a problem ahead of us.''
   Bush repeatedly has focused on the creation of some 15 million
new jobs under the Reagan administration since the end of the
1981-82 recession, which had sent the jobless rate into double
digits.
   Dukakis has countered that the issue is not the number of new
jobs being created, but the quality of those jobs. He has
emphasized that hourly wages after adjustments for inflation have
fallen since Reagan assumed office in 1981.
   August figures on inflation and average wages bolstered that
argument. The Labor Department reported that real hourly earnings
in terms of purchasing power dropped 1.3 percent during the month,
the worst decline since the government began collecting such
figures in 1964.
   The department said average hourly wages rose one-half
percentage point, or five cents, in September to $9.37 after
remaining flat in July and August.
   Over the past year, nominal hourly wages have risen at an annual
rate of 3.3 percent, compared with an inflation rate of 4 percent
as measured by consumer prices.

   The U.S. Postal Service said Friday that it
has suspended Recognition Equipment Inc. from bidding on contracts,
pending outcome of a criminal case against the company and two of
its top executives.
   REI, Chairman William G. Moore Jr. and vice president Robert W.
Reedy were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in connection
with an unsuccessful plot to rig bids on $400 million worth of
postal automation contracts.
   Assistant Postmaster General Jack Davin, in charge of
procurement, announced the suspension, which bans the company and
its subsidiaries from bidding on postal contracts for 120 days, and
can be extended pending resolution of the charges against the
company.
   Several relatively small contracts the company and its
subsidiaries currently have with the postal service will not be
affected, but cannot be expanded or renewed.
   According to the indictment, the Texas company's unsuccessful
effort was allegedly engineered in 1986 with the help of Peter E.
Voss, vice-chairman of the Postal Service's Board of Governors.
   The indictment charged that Voss, an unindicted co-conspirator,
manipulated a Postal Service decision over procuring sophisticated
optical-character scanning equipment for sorting mail.
   After the procurement scheme came to light in 1986 with Voss'
guilty plea to kickback and embezzlement charges, the Postal
Service suspended the competition and ultimately gave the contract
to another company.
   If REI had won that contract, it would have been in a position
to obtain contracts worth $4.6 billion over five years.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will use the pulpit of
three international institutions to advance his view of Western
Europe at a time when the region is divided about its future
political identity.
   On a four-day trip to France that starts Saturday, the pope will
speak to the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights
and the European Parliament, all in Strasbourg.
   The agreement by Common Market countries to fully integrate
their economies in 1992 has touched off widespread debate about
whether Western Europe should move toward becoming a single
political unit.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain raised a storm of
protest last month when she declared that a U.S.-style European
union would be ``highly damaging'' to the individual states.
   Several European countries and Common Market organs charged that
her comments were a roadblock to a long-desired goal of unity.
   Against the backdrop of this debate, the Polish-born pope is
expected to elaborate on his own vision of Europe _ one united by
Christianity and stretching ``from the Atlantic to the Urals.''
   A Vatican official said the pope wanted to address the three
international institutions because they pondered the direction of
Europe.
   ``I think he (the pope) feels very strongly that in the process
of reflection on the future of Europe, the church's voice should be
there,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   John Paul has expounded on the theme several times.
   In Spain in 1982, John Paul called on Europe to return to the
Christian principles that tied it together as in medieval days.
``You can still be the beacon of civilization and stimulate
progress throughout the world,'' he said.
   In Austria the next year, he said Christianity had formed the
basis for political systems built on respect for human rights.
   The pope felt so strongly about a common European heritage that
he released an encyclical in 1985 honoring two ninth century saints
who brought Christianity to the Slavs. In John Paul's view, Saints
Cyril and Methodius forged a link between the Eastern Orthodox and
Western Roman Catholic traditions.
   ``Part of his reflection on the Christian roots of Europe is to
encourage a revival of Christianity,'' the Vatican official said.
   The pope has expressed particular concern about the church in
France. Although over 80 percent of French citizens are Roman
Catholics, less than 20 percent attend Mass, according to French
public opinion polls.
   This trip, the pope's fourth to France, will include visits to
the dioceses of Metz, Nancy and Mulhouse in the northeast near West
Germany.
   In addition, John Paul will salute Strasbourg on its 2,000th
birthday.
   The city, which changed hands between France and Germany for
centuries, has a blend of cultures that has attracted groups
promoting European unity.
   The Council of Europe, composed of 21 parliamentary democracies,
aims to coordinate European legislation through accords. The
European Court of Human Rights hears alleged violations of the
Council of Europe's main treaty, the European Convention of Human
Rights.
   The European Parliament is the parliamentary assembly of the
European Economic Community.

   Seventy-five years ago Friday, in a small
factory in Highland Park, Henry Ford put in motion an industrial
revolution. On that day, the first Model T moved through an
assembly line, towed by a rope.
   Although the technology has been updated, the assembly line
lives on.
   ``Indeed, what happened in Detroit transformed the entire nature
of the 20th century, perhaps more than any other development except
the atomic bomb,'' said David Hounshell, a history professor at the
University of Delaware.
   ``The revolution was the installation and elaboration of the
moving assembly line,'' he said Friday at a ceremony at Ford's
Wayne assembly plant, 20 miles from the factory where Henry Ford
made _ and history.
   Actually, use of an assembly line began a few months before Oct.
7, 1913, Hounshell said. Someone in Ford's flywheel-magneto
assembly area decided to keep workers stationary and the product
moving. The technique spread to other component operations.
   ``This was the granddaddy of all assembly lines, the line one
imagines when one hears the words `assembly line,''' Hounshell
said. ``Its success _ raising the productivity of final assembly _
was overwhelming.
   ``By the early 1920s, many household appliances such as vacuum
cleaners and even radios were assembled on an assembly line.''
   On Friday, another Model T rolled off an assembly line, this one
with Ford's great-grandson, Edsel Ford II, at the wheel.
   ``At Ford Motor Co., many of our goals today are the same as
they were in my great-grandfather's time _ to meet consumers' needs
by producing affordable, high-quality vehicles that represent good
value for the money,'' Ford said.
   Not all workers were enamored with the assembly line in late
1913. There was high employee turnover and talk of work stoppages _
until Henry Ford in 1914 announced he would pay workers the
then-incredible sum of $5 per day.
   Within a year, the winch-and-rope system that drew the first
Model T through the plant was replaced by a chain. With other
manufacturing improvements, production time continued to drop, as
did the cost of the vehicle.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Strikes Down EPA Policy on Labeling of Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday struck down
an Environmental Protection Agency policy not to list used oil
collected for recyling as hazardous waste.
   At issue was EPA's decision in 1986 that a hazardous-waste
designation would only create a stigma and discourage many
locations such as gasoline stations from collecting used oil for
recycling.
   But a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here said that factor cannot be taken into account, particularly
when EPA had already concluded that a broad category of used oils
were hazardous wastes.
   ``The EPA erroneously based its decision not to list recycled
oils as hazardous wastes on the stigmatic effects of such a
listing, a factor not permitted by the statute,'' the court said.
   It ordered EPA to determine if recycled oils ``meet the
technical criteria for listing'' as hazardous wastes.
   ``I would consider this a major victory'' to clean up ``billions
of gallons of used oil,'' said Jane L. Bloom, an attorney for the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   She predicted that the court's decision will force EPA to
declare broad categories of used oil hazardous wastes because the
agency's own studies have documented that it contains many toxic
chemicals.
   ``The court's action should force EPA to stop the dumping of
waste oil into municipal landfills and lead to better treatment an
reclamation of the oil,'' said David R. Case, general counsel of
the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council.
   The decision ``means EPA should be more concerned about the
stigma of harm to the environment than the stigma of calling
recycled oil a hazardous waste,'' said Case, whose organization
represents large waste-disposal companies.
   Lisa Friedman, an EPA attorney, said the court ruling ``arguably
leaves a lot of discretion to the agency to determine whether
certain oils are hazardous.'' She said the agency was studying the
ruling and had not decided how to proceed.
   In 1985, EPA proposed to list a broad category of used
automotive and industrial oils as hazardous wastes. But it backed
off in 1986, after receiving nearly 800 comments from gasoline
dealers and other recyclers.
   The agency deferred any decision on used oil generally but
decided not to list oil collected for recycling as hazardous waste.
   ``The effect of listing would create such a stigma in the used
oil recycling industry that many recycling sources woudl simply
refuse to take used oil,'' Friedman said.
   EPA decided that ``the used oil might then be diverted to less
environmentally sound management options such as throwing it down
the sewer,'' she said.
   The appeals court said ``EPA's concern over the possible adverse
environmental consequences of listing used oil may well be
warranted,'' but such views ``cannot override the intent of
Congress clearly expressed in the language and structure of the
statute.''
   ``It is the agency's obligation to comply with the dictates of
Congress and ours to enforce them,'' a three-judge panel said in an
opinion by Circuit Judge James L. Buckley that was joined by Judges
Stephen Williams and Edward D. Re.
   Congress ``carefully separated the listing decision from the
resultant regulatory decisions,'' Buckley wrote, and a 1985 law
enacted to prod EPA to take action ``simply requires the agency to
determine whether to list used oil as hazardous.''
   ``Only after the EPA decides to list does the statute permit it
to consider the effect of its regulations on recycling,'' he wrote.
   The EPA estimates that 1.2 billion gallons of used oil is
produced annually, but only half is recycled, said Jacqueline
Warren, another attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``The laundry list of substances that have been found in used
oil is alarming,'' she said. These include benzene, PCB and heavy
metals such as lead, cadmium and chromium.
   In a separate opinion issued Friday, the appeals court panel
upheld EPA's rules governing the burning of hazardous waste and
used oil.

   Mickey Mouse wore a lab coat and
glasses Friday as Disney World dedicated the first working
plant-biotechnology lab open to the public.
   The laboratory will research and produce plants through genetic
engineering and tissue culture.
   Tourists on the boat ride through Epcot Center's Land Pavilion
will be able to observe technicians working to develop new plant
varieties and improve food crops to speed growth, increase yields
and become pest- and drought-resistant.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture donated the equipment used in
the lab, which was financed by Kraft Inc., sponsor of the Land
Pavilion.
   ``It's a splendid educational effort,'' said Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng, who participated in dedication ceremonies.
   ``This is a small lab, an exhibit. ... We don't want to
overemphasize its importance, but it is on the cutting edge of
biotechnology and the value is in people getting a chance to see''
work carried out in this important field, Lyng said.
   Up to 25,000 people a day go through the Land Pavilion and most
take the ride that circles the lab.
   Others, such as students or workers in the field, can request a
more specialized tour through it, said Henry Robitaille,
agricultural systems manager for the pavilion.

   In an area of Arlington National Cemetery
dotted with monuments, a small group of journalists and retired
journalists gathered Friday to remember colleagues who were killed
covering wars.
   ``The names are too many to mention, and to mention one without
the others wouldn't be fair,'' said Keyes Beech, who covered World
War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam war for the Chicago Daily
News. ``We all knew who they were and what they stood for.''
   The ceremony was sponsored by four organizations, No Greater
Love, the National Press Club, the Overseas Press Club and the
Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, and was held
at an oak tree planted by these organizations two years ago.
   The audience of about 50 also was addressed by Don Mell, a
photographer who was with Terry Anderson when the Associated Press'
chief Middle East correspondent was kidnapped in Beirut. Friday was
the 1,302nd day of his captivity.
   Mell said one man put a gun to his head while two others grabbed
Anderson. ``I wanted to recue Terry, but I couldn't,'' Mell said.
``At that moment Terry's eyes met mine as if to say, `Don, do
something.'''
   Peter Arnett, a Cable News Network correspondent who covered the
Vietnam war for the Associated Press, was master of ceremonies. ``I
prefer to believe,'' he said, ``that the hard-won traditions of the
war correspondents and the scarifice of those we honor today are
beacons for all journalists of today and tomorrow.'' he said.
   The tree is in a cluster of memorials, one honoring Korean War
veterans, another for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action,
another for the seven Challenger astronauts and one for the
soldiers and airmen who died in the attempt to free the American
hostages in Lebanon.
   Next to the tree is a memorial stone in the form of an open
book. It honors 268 reporters and cameramen around the world killed
while covering conflicts.
   ``One who finds a truth lights a torch,'' is inscribed on the
stone.

   Veteran politicians who rose to
prominence before Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power 15 years ago
dominate the field of potential candidates for a presidential
election next year.
   In the opposition, which includes parties from the left to the
center-right, a few younger leaders who made important
contributions to the fight against the authoritarian president also
are among possible nominees.
   Pinochet, 72, would be the top contender on the right if he
decides to run. The constitution allows him to be a candidate, but
he has not announced his plans.
   On Wednesday, Chileans voted in a referendum to reject
Pinochet's bid to extend his rule until 1997, clearing the way for
an election in December 1989.
   Patricio Aylwin and Ricardo Lagos, moderate politicians who led
the opposition campaign for the referendum, are the strongest
contenders in the opposition.
   Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic party,
the country's largest, is a seasoned politican and former senator
who played a key role in the tumultuous days before the 1973 coup
in which Pinochet toppled the elected government of Salvador
Allende.
   Aylwin was the main spokesman for the 16-party coalition that
campaigned against Pinochet in the referendum, and he received more
publicity than most of his peers. In a massively attended final
campaign rally, he delivered a forceful and eloquent speech that
showed his oratory skills.
   Aylwin, a 67-year-old law professor, is more widely accepted by
conservative sectors than Lagos and other prominent opposition
leaders.
   Lagos, 50, a moderate socialist economist and lawyer, is a
relative newcomer to politics. He was catapulted to national
prominence by his dramatic performance in a campaign television
debate.
   In the debate, the charismatic, tough-talking Lagos challenged
Pinochet personally, staring into the camera and shaking his
finger. Never before during Pinochet's rule had television shown
such a scene.
   But many consider Lagos' socialist ideas and his connections
with the Allende government offensive to center-right groups in the
opposition. Lagos was a middle-ranking official for the Allende
administration.
   Aylwin and Lagos have denied any presidential ambitions and said
the opposition needs an all-out effort to agree on a single
candidate to lead a ``government of national unity'' after Pinochet.
   ``It's too early to talk about candidates,'' Aylwin said
Thursday in his first news conference after the opposition victory.
   Lagos, asked Friday about his possible presidential candidacy,
replied: ``Is there going to be an election now? As far as I know,
Augusto Pinochet is still pretty much alive and well.''
   Many observers think Aylwin would have a better chance at
nomination, especially if the opposition succeeds with plans to
create a four-year transition government. Lagos' comparative youth
gives him the option of waiting until a later election.
   Other dissident figures mentioned as potential candidates
include Christian Democrats Gabriel Valdes, 66, and Andres
Zaldivar, 52. Both held Cabinet posts in the government of former
president Eduardo Frei in the 1960s, but they gained additional
prominence in the years of opposition to Pinochet.
   The only civilian with prominence anywhere near Pinochet's is
Sergio Onofre Jarpa, a 67-year-old landowner and former senator
with a reputation of being as fiercily anti-communist as Pinochet.
   Few doubt that Pinochet himself could be nominated. Despite his
defeat in the referendum, he still won 43 percent of the vote.
   ``He is the most important political figure in the country,''
said Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez. ``Few leaders in the world
would be able to get such an extrordinary vote after 15 years in
power.''

   About 10,000 people chanting ``You
betrayed the people!'' demanded the resignation of local Communist
Party leaders Friday in a march on a Yugoslav republic's
parliament, Belgrade radio reported.
   In Belgrade, the ruling Politburo issued a statement promising
high-level personnel changes and the introduction of radical
market-oriented economic reform in an effort to stem three months
of unrest over economic and ethnic issues.
   The street rally in Titograd, in the republic of Montenegro,
began after 1,000 construction workers stopped work to protest low
wages and falling living standards, the radio report said. About
10,000 protesters then marched to the legislature, the radio said.
   Demonstrations also broke out in Belgrade and in the city of
Krusevac, the radio said.
   The protests came a day after an estimated 30,000 protesters
stormed a Communist Party headquarters and forced the resignation
of party leaders in the autonomous province of Vojvodina, in the
Serbian republic.
   Serbian nationalists have led most recent protests, but the
rallies are driven also by an economic crisis that has inflation at
217 percent, the foreign debt at $21 billion and unemployment at 15
percent.
   Friday's statement by the Politburo promised ``to make necessary
personnel changes'' in an Oct. 17 meeting of the policy-setting
Central Committee ``which should contribute to the more efficient
work of that organ.''
   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, also
called for the introduction of a radical market-oriented economic
reform next year.
   In a recent interview, Premier Branko Mikulic mentioned a major
reform of Yugoslavia's mixed economy. The reform, scheduled to be
adopted Nov. 29 in Parliament, will introduce more private
businesses, allow majority foreign ownership of businesses and
close or sell off money-losing state companies.
   The statement also promised a major reduction in government but
did not elaborate.
   In Krusevac, 90 miles south of Belgrade, several thousand
workers demonstrated to demand higher wages and the ouster of
Communist leaders, the radio said.
   In Belgrade, 400 high school students from Kosovo marched on the
national Parliament, chanting that the mainly Christian Serbs will
never give up power in Kosovo, an autonomous province bordering
Albania.
   Mainly Moslem ethnic Albanians now make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
   The teen-agers, joined by Belgrade students, protested alleged
harassment by Albanians. They were met at Parliament by Vice
President Spasoje Medenica, who listened to their grievances before
they dispersed, Tanjug said.
   Several dozen Communist party leaders have been attacked by name
in recent rallies by Serbs.
   After the resignation of Vojvodina province's 15 Politburo
members, the largely Albanian Communist party leadership in Kosovo
is expected to come under pressure to make sweeping changes at a
meeting it holds Oct. 13.
   The resignations in Vojvodina were a major victory for Serbian
Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic, who wants more control
over the two provinces.
   The Serbian leader's opponents suspect he is using the mass
rallies to gain more national power for himself and for Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Many Serbs see Milosevic as political heir to the late President
Josip Broz Tito, who died in 1980 and left the nation with a
complex system of annual rotation in the occupants of top political
offices.
   Milosevic's advance alarms many politicians in Yugoslavia's
other republics.

   A mercenary shot down in Nicaragua flying supplies
to the Contras is suing Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and
Albert Hakim for $135 million, saying they misled the crew and
abandoned him during three months of captivity.
   Eugene Hasenfus of Marinette, Wis., also sued Southern Air
Transport, a shadowy, CIA-linked cargo airline, and Corporate Air
Services, which he identified as a shell company owned by Southern
Air and controlled by Secord and Hakim.
   Southern Air spokesman Jack Thale denied Friday any connection
with Hasenfus. The suit claimed the company paid his expenses.
   Hasenfus filed a similar suit in Washington federal court in
May, but jurisdiction questions are pending there because the
planes allegedly flew out of Miami, where Southern Air and
Corporate Air are based.
   Hasenfus' plane was shot down over Nicaragua in 1986. He
parachuted to safety, but three crewmen died. Hasenfus was tried by
the Sandinistas and sentenced to 30 years in prison, then sent back
to the United States after three months.
   Hasenfus and his wife, Sally, said they were told the supply
operation was a patriotic mission, but later found out Secord and
Hakim were profiting from the deal.
   He also said Secord, Hakim and the State Department promised
help when he was captured, but never delivered.
   ``This guy was captured by the Sandinistas,'' said Secord's
attorney, Thomas C. Green. ``What did he expect, that the U.S.
military would step in and save him?''
   The suit, filed Tuesday in federal court, says that Hasenfus was
recruited in 1986 through Corporate Air and William Cooper, a
Southern Air pilot.
   Cooper, who later died in the crash, led Hasenfus to believe
``the Contra resupply operation was being run `right out of the
back door of the White House''' by Oliver North, Secord, Hakim and
Southern Air, the suit said.
   Hakim and Secord, a retired Air Force major general, are accused
with former National Security Council figures Oliver North and John
Poindexter of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting
proceeds from Iran arms sales to the Contras at a time when
Congress banned U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   Thale denied any relationship between Southern Air and Corporate
Air, although Federal Aviation Administration records in 1986
listed them at the same address.

   The director general of UNESCO pledged Friday to
revamp the organization's communications programs so the United
States and Britain will return to the world body they accused of
being anti-Western.
   Federico Mayor said UNESCO's role as a forum for attitudes such
as restrictions on press freedom prompted the two countries to
resign from the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
   The United States left at the end of 1984 and Britain left in
1985. They accused Mayor's predecessor, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of
Senegal, of an anti-Western bias.
   ``Frankly, I consider that the problem ... was not mismanagement
and the other reasons given but was mainly related to programs,
particularly the communications program,'' Mayor said.
   The Spanish biochemist, who took over as head of UNESCO 11
months ago, told a news conference that a new communications
program he was preparing would try to overcome controversies that
have dogged the organization for more than a decade.
   ``This is a house of freedom, and we can never go against our
constitution which says we guarantee a free flow of information,''
Mayor said. He said he rejected the concept of a ``new world
information order'' promoted by Third World and Soviet bloc nations.
   Mayor also said he could not accept proposals made in the past
at UNESCO that critics said could lead to licensing of journalists.
   Asked whether he was retreating from UNESCO resolutions that
call for a better balance in the flow of information between
industrialized nations and the Third World, Mayor said providing
equipment and training for people in communications, and not just
journalists, was the best way to arrive at a more balanced
situation.
   He has proposed that UNESCO establish a satellite network for
education, report on the state of the environment annually and
educate youths on the dangers of using drugs to improve athletic
performance.
   Third World countries have long complained that the
industralized nations dominate the flow of information. Under M'Bow
they joined up with the Soviet bloc to seek ways to control the
press by establishing the new information order.
   Mayor said the new communications program will be submitted to
the governing Executive Board, which meets next week to plan for
the 1990s.
   Mayor said he was working hard to get the United States and
Britain to rejoin because without them the organization was
``mutilated.'' Singapore also has withdrawn from UNESCO.
   Both the United States and Britain have said it will be at least
1990 before they will consider returning to UNESCO. Between them
they provided 30 percent of the budget for the 158-nation body.
   Mayor was in Britain earlier in the week lobbying for its return
and plans a similar trip to the United States in December.

   A group of 501 Kurdish refugees returned
to Iraq voluntarily on Friday, two months after they fled and
claimed that Iraqi forces dropped chemical bombs on their
settlements.
   Regional Gov. Hayri Kozakcioglu said in a telephone interview
that the Kurdish refugees, the second group to return, were
transferred to Iraq from a southeastern border post in Habur.
   A group of 969 Kurdish refugees returned to Iraq on Wednesday.
   The two groups were among 60,000 Kurds who were settled in five
tent cities in southeastern Turkey in August after they left Iraq.
   At the urging of Turkey, Iraq proclaimed an amnesty for the
Kurds. Before the first group returned, only two Kurds had taken
advantage of the amnesty.
   The second group of Kurds was granted special status because the
amnesty expired Thursday night, a Turkish government official said
on condition of anonymity.
   Kozakcioglu said some of the refugees at Diyarbakir tent city
threw stones at the returnees Friday and tried to keep them from
leaving. He said they called the returnees traitors and ``spies of
the Iraqi regime.''
   Police fired in the air and firefighters shot water to disperse
the crowd. Kozakcioglu said two policemen and four Kurds were
slightly injured.
   The Kurds traveled for 20 hours on buses and open trucks to the
border. The government said Iraq gave assurances that the refugees
would be safely settled in their villages.
   Turkey initially asked the International Red Cross to supervise
the return, but the Red Cross declined after Iraq refused to grant
its request for further guarantees on behalf of the refugees.
   The Kurds, 20 million people living in a region where borders of
Turkey, Iran and Iraq converge, have been fighting for independence
for the past century.
   Iraq stepped up attacks on the Kurds soon after Iran agreed to a
cease-fire in their eight-year war on Aug. 20.
   Security forces in the southeastern township of Uludere killed
two Kurdish guerrillas in a clash, the regional governor's office
said.
   The statement, carried by the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency, said authorities told rebels to surrender and the
guerrillas opened fire on Thursday. It said one guerrilla was
captured.
   The suspects were responsible for killing a policeman and a
village guard and wounding three soldiers in three different
attacks.
   The guerrillas were believed to be members of the outlawed
Kurdish Labor Party, which wants to set up a Marxist state in parts
of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   More than 900 civilians and security personnel and an equal
number of insurgents have been killed since the rebels started
hit-and-run attacks in 1984, official reports say.
   Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of 52
million.

<TEXT>
   The judge accused in a scheme by former Miss
America Bess Myerson to fix her lover's divorce took an unusual
personal interest in the case, even after it moved to a higher
court, a witness said Friday.
   In testimony at the trial of Miss Myerson; her lover, Carl
``Andy'' Capasso, and state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel,
Mrs. Gabel's former law secretary detailed how the judge deviated
from her routine in handling Capasso's divorce. Supreme Court is
New York State's trial-level court.
   But under cross examination, the former law secretary, Howard
Leventhal, conceded that while he disagreed with his boss's
handling of the Capasso case, determining support payments is ``an
art not a science.''
   Mrs. Gabel is accused of cutting Capasso's support payments to
his estranged wife, Nancy, in 1983, in exchange for Miss Myerson
giving a city job to the judge's daughter. Miss Myerson at the time
was city cultural affairs commissioner.
   When Mrs. Capasso appealed Mrs. Gabel's ruling, Leventhal said
the judge asked him to obtain copies of the appeal documents some
time before the higher court ruled. The appeals court restored the
higher payments.
   Leventhal testified that it was the first time Mrs. Gabel made
such a request even though hundreds of her decisions were appealed
during the six years he worked for her.
   Previously, Leventhal testified that in June 1983 Mrs. Gabel
ordered Capasso to pay his wife $1,850 a week but reduced that to
$680 a week in September.
   During that summer, said Leventhal, Miss Myerson _ often using
an alias _ called Mrs. Gabel many times on a private line in the
judge's chambers.
   He also said Mrs. Gabel personally drafted her ruling in the
Capasso case, one of the few times she did so in 3,700 court
motions.

   Leftist rebels claimed
responsibility Friday for a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the
national legislature, which they called ``the lair of the corrupt.''
   Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas' clandestine station, said the
Thursday attack, which damaged a wall but caused no injuries, was
an operation dubbed ``Armed with bazookas, the people will
triumph.''
   A projectile fired from a Chinese-made RPG-2 slammed into a wall
of the unicameral National Assembly shortly before the day's
session began. The impact startled spectators entering the building
only a few yards from where the grenade struck.
   ``This audacious guerrilla action demonstrates the inability of
the puppet armed forces, a useless army that is not even capable of
guarding utility poles, nor highways, nor its own barracks, nor the
National Assembly,'' said the Radio Venceremos broadcast.
   The broadcast characterized the Assembly as ``the lair of the
corrupt and death-squad members.''
   A congressional commission and several judges are investigating
cases of alleged misuse of public funds by government officials.
There have also been allegations right-wing death squads operated
out of the Assembly building during the early 1980s, when thousands
of suspected leftists were abducted and murdered.
   A 9-year-old civil war pits the rebels against forces of the
U.S.-backed Christian Democratic administration. In 1982, the
Assembly was the target of a similar rocket-propelled grenade
attack, which also caused no injuries.
   About 65,000 people have been killed in the war, the majority of
them civilians.

<HEAD>Jewish Businessman Willing to Talk to Bakkers About Heritage
Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen J. Mernick, the Orthodox Jewish
businessman who wants to purchase the assets of the PTL Christian
ministry, said Friday he is keeping all options open about their
future use.
   He said he is willing to talk to Jim and Tammy Bakker about
their possible activities at Heritage USA, a Christian retreat and
theme park in York County, S.C., and the other assets to be
purchased for $115 million.
   ``I have made no decision whatsoever as to the utilization of
the Heritage assets,'' Mernick, 34, said at a news conference at
his lawyer's office in the Toronto suburb of North York.
   ``Over the next several weeks I will be engaged in an intensive
analysis of the property in order to determine their best possible
use from a business and financial standpoint,'' he said.
   Mernick said he was interested primarily in the assets for their
real estate potential _ especially the 1,700 undeveloped acres
adjacent to the 500-acre Heritage park.
   He did not rule out negotiating with the Bakkers about their
lease of any of the properties or the satellite television
facilities.
   ``I'm a very open-minded person. I'm prepared to speak to them
and anyone,'' Mernick said.
   Bakker stepped down as leader of PTL after admitting to a sexual
encounter in March 1987 but has since been trying to regain control
of the ministry.
   Mernick clarified in an opening statement that he was purchasing
only the fixed assets from the trustee in bankruptcy and not the
Heritage church itself.
   ``It is my understanding that the Heritage Church has been set
up as a separate and distinct organization which leases certain of
the facilities at Heritage USA on a month-to-month basis,'' he said.
   Mernick said he believed the 1,700 undeveloped acres have
excellent potential for condominiums, retail and office development.
   He also said a motion was filed Friday morning with the
bankruptcy court seeking approval of the purchase contract and all
deposits have been paid to the escrow agent as outlined.
   Mernick's family has roots in Toronto real estate that go back
40 years, but he was little known outside the area's Orthodox
Jewish community until March when he purchased the old Firestone
Canada Inc. tire plant in Hamilton, Ont.
   Mernick released a summary saying that in addition to the
Firestone property he owns 270 acres for mixed use development in
New York's Westchester County and about 900 acres in Ontario.
   Among his other interests are a landfill site in the Toronto
area, a 50 percent interest in a local waste disposal and recycling
company and wholesale and retail travel agencies.
   PTL stands for ``Praise The Lord,'' or ``People That Love.''

<HEAD>Pilot Bails Out Safely As Chase Jet Crashes During NASA Research

<TEXT>
   An experimental NASA jet crashed in the
Mojave Desert while serving as a chase plane for a research flight
Friday, but the pilot ejected safely, a spokeswoman said.
   Stephen Ishmael, 39, ``was out waving before the helicopter
picked him up'' from the crash site near here, said Nancy Lovato, a
NASA spokeswoman at Edwards Air Force Base. ``He's been checked by
a flight surgeon and he's fine.''
   Cheryl Sorensen, a dispatcher for Kern County Fire Department,
said her agency provided some type of medical aid and extinguished
a grass fire caused by the crash.
   Lovato said Ishmael was piloting a modified F-A-18 chase plane
as a safety measure. He was following another F-A-18 conducting a
research flight when he ``experienced problems with the airplane's
control system'' and bailed out, she said.
   The Navy uses similar F-18 jets as fighter-attack aircraft, but
NASA is using the modified F-A-18s in a ``high angle of attack''
program aimed at designing highly maneuverable jets, she said.
   Lovato said the F-A-18, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., wasn't
being flown at a high angle of attack, a measurement of wing angle
relative to air flow, when Ishmael encountered trouble.
   Ishmael is chief pilot for NASA's research program on the X-29,
a jet that has its wings swept forward instead of backward as on
conventional aircraft.
   Both F-A-18s had taken off from Edwards Air Force Base. Boron is
about 10 miles east of the base and about 125 miles northeast of
Los Angeles.
   NASA spokesman Ralph Jackson said Navy F-18s cost roughly $20
million to $25 million, but the prototype F-A-18 that crashed was
worth about $5 million.

   Clutching a Bible and wiping his eyes, a
distraught James L. Harvey was sentenced Friday to life in prison
plus 20 years for taking hostage 110 children and adults at a
church school in Tuscaloosa.
   Harvey, at the encouragement of his sisters, pleaded guilty to
six counts of kidnapping in the Feb. 2 takeover of West End
Christian School.
   Circuit Judge John M. Karrh, who moved the trial to Huntsville
because of publicity in Tuscaloosa, also recommended Harvey get
psychiatric help.
   Harvey, whose guilty plea cut short his trial after three days,
had maintained during the 12-hour siege that he was exercising his
right to bear arms and was making a statement for the nation's
homeless, poor and illiterate.
   The 43-year-old man, who had defended himself during the trial,
sat at the defense table and cried as he signed a form that said he
understood his rights.
   Gov. Guy Hunt was scheduled to testify Friday. Harvey had
summoned him as a defense witness because the governor's videotape
of a bogus pardon had persuaded Harvey to put aside his three guns
and end the takeover.
   Harvey had been charged with 110 counts of kidnapping, which
carried a maximum sentence of up to 10,000 years. The charges were
combined into six counts.
   ``He is mentally and physically exhausted,'' said an older
sister, Martha Gray. ``I've thought all along that he needed mental
help. I love him and I want him well. He's a very frightened boy.''
   Another man, John Rhodes Jr., also was charged in the takeover
but was freed after authorities determined that Harvey had tricked
him into helping.

   Jim and Tammy Bakker are moving their
ministry into new leased quarters on a millionaire's estate, across
the state line from their former PTL complex, but say they'll
continue trying to regain control of PTL.
   Volunteers on Friday moved furniture into the new headquarters
of Jim and Tammy Ministries, a brick colonial house on a 300-acre
estate owned by Amway tycoon Dexter Yager.
   ``As you can see, we're not set up for company just yet,''
Bakker's secretary, Sue Hartman, said in the front hall moments
after Bakker, clad in a blue sweat suit, ducked into a back room.
   On Monday, Jim and Tammy Ministries began moving from their
storefront office near PTL's Christian theme park, Heritage USA, in
Fort Mill, S.C.
   The Bakkers had set up shop at a Fort Mill shopping plaza, but
their space was leased to someone else, said Bakker spokesman Hal
Sweigart.
   Bakker had made a bid to buy back PTL last month for $172
million, but the deal fell through when he could not prove he had
the financial backing.
   Earlier this week, PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
announced he had accepted a $115 million offer for PTL's assets
from Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick.
   However, Bakker has not given up trying to regain control of the
ministry he built, aides said.
   ``We consider the new office an interim step on the way back to
Heritage USA,'' said Lin Robertson, a volunteer at Jim and Tammy
Ministries.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in 1987 after admitting a sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn seven years earlier in
a Florida motel room.

   Israeli troops killed four Palestinians and
wounded 21 Friday during street battles in Nablus sparked by the
mysterious death of a man reportedly found manacled with army rope,
Arab reports said.
   The violence also was fed by rumors, denied by the army, that
soldiers fired into a mosque.
   It was the highest one-day death toll in six months.
   Sixteen Palestinians were reported wounded elsewhere in the
occupied territories.
   An army official confirmed one death in Nablus, largest city in
the West Bank, but said soldiers were not involved. He said the
army was checking the other fatalities.
   Mohammed Shaar, a 32-year-old Palestinian suspected of
collaborating with Israel, was found stabbed to death in a cave
near Burka village in the West Bank, Israel radio and Arab reports
said. The army said it was checking.
   At least 289 Palestinians have been killed since the uprising
against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war. Six Israelis also have died.
   Military authorities put a curfew on Nablus and adjoining
refugee camps, confining more than 120,000 Palestinians to their
homes. The violence was fed by rumors that soldiers chasing
stone-throwers fired into the Salah Edin Mosque during evening
prayers Thursday. The army said the rumors were untrue.
   Tension grew in Nablus after the death of Adnan Hanfa, 31, whose
body was found near the mosque Thursday night, his hands bound
together with army-issue plastic rope. Hospital officials said he
had been shot several times.
   Army officials said soldiers killed a Palestinian in clashes
near the mosque Thursday night, but it was not clear whether they
meant Hanfa.
   ``As a result of the death and the rumors about entering the
mosque, tension was created in the city,'' an officer said on
Israel television.
   Hundreds of Palestinians chanting pro-PLO slogans carried
Hanfa's coffin through the city Friday morning.
   After the funeral and Moslem noon prayers, stone-throwing Arab
youths and soldiers fought throughout Nablus and the adjacent
Balata and Askar refugee camps.
   Arab reporters claimed Samir Bahloul, 26, was in the doorway of
his house when soldiers breaking up a nearby protest fatally shot
him in the head and stomach. The army confirmed the death but said
troops were not involved.
   Nidal Ali Najar, 20, was fatally shot in the head after dozens
of Arab youths gathered outside the central market to throw stones
at soldiers to protest Bahloul's death, hospital officials said.
   Ali Sayeh, 20, was dead on arrival at St. John's Hospital in
Nablus after being shot in the chest during a clash in the Ras al
Ain neighborhood, Arab reporters and hospital officials said.
   A fourth Palestinian, 17-year-old Ahmed Mashtaraweh, was shot in
the head during a clash and died en route to Jerusalem's Mukassed
Hospital, hospital officials reported.
   Of the 21 wounded in Nablus, two were in critical condition,
including a 9-year-old boy with a bullet in the chest, hospital
officials said. Also among the casualties was a 5-year-old boy from
the Askar camp who suffered a thigh wound.
   The army said a soldier was hit in the head by a stone in Nablus
and hospitalized.
   Of the other Palestinians reported wounded, five were in the
West Bank and 11 in the Gaza Strip.
   Soldiers demolished the home of a Gaza City resident who
allegedly threw a hand grenade at an Israeli's car last week, the
army said.

<HEAD>Cuba, Angola, South Africa Meet To Discuss Namibia, Cuban
Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuba, Angola and South Africa held
informal talks Friday on plans for South Africa to end its rule
over neighboring South-West Africa and for Cuba to withdraw about
50,000 troopers from Angola.
   Chester Crocker, U.S. undersecretary of state for African
affairs, mediated the talks, continuing the role he played in
meetings earlier this year in Brazzaville, the Congo, according to
American and South African officials.
   Aubry Dwyer, a spokesman for South Africa's U.N. Mission,
confirmed the talks were being held. He said the South African
delegation was led by Neil van Heerden, director-general of
political affairs.
   No announcement was expected at the conclusion of the talks and
officials did not say where the negotiations were being held, other
than they were in New York.
   Dwyer said the talks dealt with a timetable for the withdrawal
of the Cuban military personnel in line with the Nov. 1 deadline
South Africa accepted for beginning a plan for independence for
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   South Africa insists the Cubans should be removed from
Marxist-ruled Angola in about a year.
   In earlier rounds of talks, Cuba and Angola first said the
withdrawal would take four years, then lowered that to three and
last month reportedly accepted a proposal for a two-year phased
withdrawal.
   Officials involved in the talks have expressed confidence a
mutually acceptable timetable will be worked out during the next
formal meeting of the four parties in Brazzaville.
   No date has been set for those talks, but they presumably would
be held before the Nov. 1 date for South Africa to begin
implementing U.N. Resolution 435, passed 10 years ago, calling for
independence for Namibia.
   The United Nations plans to send a peacekeeping force of 7,500
military personnel and 2,000 members of a civilian support staff to
oversee elections for a national assembly in Namibia.
   A U.N. advance team is now in Namibia checking on housing,
airports and other facilities the peacekeepers will need. U.N.
officials have estimated the peacekeeping force, to be called the
U.N. Transition Assistance Group, will cost $600 million to $700
million.
   South Africa has administered Namibia under a mandate from the
defunct League of Nations since the end of World War I.
   The U.N. General Assembly and Security Council have revoked the
mandate and declared South Africa's administration illegal.
   Namibia is located between South Africa and Angola, which
received independence from Portugal in 1975. Marxist forces
defeated pro-Western groups in a civil war following independence.

supported by South Africa and the United States, have waged
guerrilla warfare against the government and Cuba sent troops into
Angola to help battle the rebels.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh moved Friday
to develop programs that maintain ``the highest ethical standards''
in a department previously run by Edwin Meese III who was for 14
months under criminal investigation.
   ``Subordinates cannot be left to speculate as to the values of
the organization,'' Thornburgh said in his first major speech to
Justice Department employees as attorney general.
   ``Top leadership must give forth clear and explicit signals,
lest any confusion or uncertainty exist over what is and is not
permissible conduct,'' Thornburgh added.
   He said that ``to do otherwise allows informal and potentially
subversive `codes of conduct' to be transmitted with a wink and a
nod, and encourages an inferior ethical system based on `going
along to get along' or on the notion that `everybody's doing it.'''
   The attorney general in his remarks made no reference to Meese,
who left the department in August. Thornburgh introduced the
subject of ethics by quoting the results of a newly released
Associated Press-Media General poll showing that seven out of 10
Americans think illegal payoffs are common in the federal
government.
   Thornburgh also raised the issue of how close the relationship
should be between an attorney general and the president, saying
that how their relationship ``can be both as close as it should be
and as correct as it ought to be is a difficult question'' and one
that is worthy of study. Thornburgh said there is a ``need to look
analytically'' at the relationship.
   A Thornburgh assistant, David Runkel, later said Thornburgh
wasn't referring to any specific relationship, such as the
particularly close one between President Reagan and Meese. Runkel
said that Thornburgh was expressing a general feeling that the
matter should be examined, as a subject of scholarly study outside
the Justice Department, and that the comment wasn't meant as ``a
criticism of anyone.''
   The criminal investigation of Meese stemmed from his ties to
longtime friend E. Robert Wallach and culminated in July with no
indictment but a finding by independent counsel James McKay that
Meese had probably twice broken conflict-of-interest laws and tax
laws.
   Thornburgh said he has requested Deputy Attorney General Harold
Christensen ``to gather the views of all senior management to help
in developing proposals that will aid our employees in maintaining
the highest ethical standards.''
   He said the questions that should be addressed include how to
avoid any appearance of personal and financial conflict of
interest, how to deal with lapses in behavior, how to properly
regulate interaction between employees and outside groups and what
`perks' are proper and which are out of bounds.
   ``The overall goal is not to put shackles on a department whose
honesty and integrity are beyond any serious dispute,'' said
Thornburgh. ``The goal .. is to put our ideals and our principles
on the record, and to say to the public, `These are our standards
and we mean to live up to them. Watch us do it.'''
   A section of the code of federal regulations sets out standards
of conduct for Justice Department employees, dealing with such
questions as potential conflicts of interest.
   But ``what the attorney general asked Christensen to do is to
review that code in light of current concerns and current issues,''
Runkel said after the speech. He said ethics are a subject of
increasing concern in business, politics and the religious
community as well.
   ``Because something was written 10 years ago doesn't mean it
applies to all situatons today,'' said Runkel, who said the result
of the Justice Department effort may mean ``some clarifications,
not a massive re-write'' of the Justice Department portion of the
code of federal regulations pertaining to ethics.
   The new attorney general also said that department employees
should ``close ranks'' following internal debate so that the
Justice Department speaks ``with one voice.'' To do otherwise, he
said, would only give ``aid and comfort to our adversaries.''
   In addition, Thornburgh said that his management style is ``no
surprises,'' that he wants to hear bad news directly from employees
and that ``I don't want to find out about it first by the backdoor
or from our friends in the news media.''

<HEAD>Reagan Calls Rowan To Congratulate Him on Dropping of Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan telephoned syndicated
columnist Carl T. Rowan on Friday to offer congratulations on the
District of Columbia's decision to drop its weapons-possession case
against him, Rowan said.
   ``The president said it was an outrage that they prosecuted
me,'' said Rowan, who had lashed out on Thursday at city officials,
calling their case against him a ``malicious, political
prosecution.''
   Reagan made the call because he considers Rowan a friend and was
concerned about him, according to a White House official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The 63-year-old columnist had been charged with using an
unregistered weapon and ammunition to wound a teen-ager who
intruded in his back yard in June. If he had been convicted on the
misdemeanor charges, he would have faced a maximum penalty of two
years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   When a jury hearing the case remained deadlocked after more than
eight hours, District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Arthur L.
Burnett Sr. declared a mistrial. The city decided Wednesday not to
retry the case.
   Rowan, who has advocated strict handgun control in columns and
speeches, has stressed that he also had the right to take whatever
means necessary to protect himself and his family. The columnist
said Reagan agreed.
   ``He (Reagan) reiterated his stance that he's in favor of a
waiting period so that criminals and nuts cannot buy guns,'' Rowan
said. ``But he does not favor a situation where robbers and rapists
can sit assured that they can have a gun.''
   Rowan, who has dined privately with the Reagans, said he and the
president talked about his legal ordeal and other matters for four
or five minutes.
   Rowan and Nancy Reagan were guests of Washington Redskins owner
Jack Kent Cooke for last Sunday's contest against the New York
Giants, where Mrs. Reagan delivered an anti-drug message.
   When Rowan mentioned that he had seen Mrs. Reagan at the
football contest, the president responded, ``You know, that lady
had a lot to do with my calling,'' according to Rowan.
   More than 200 other well-wishers have telephoned him in the last
two days, Rowan said.
   ``I don't think it will quiet down for another 200 calls,'' he
said.

   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board
vacated on Friday another Nuclear Regulatory Commission panel's
decision to go forward with a full-power license for the Shoreham
nuclear power plant on Long Island, N.Y.
   The appeal board found that the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board did not have the authority to remove state and local
governments as intevenors in a case before a different panel, said
NRC spokesman John Kopeck.
   Friday's ruling ``reverses that and at the same time, says all
outstanding emergency planning issues have not been resolved,''
Kopeck said.
   ``Thus, the full-power license authorization does not exist and
that authorization must be vacated,'' he said.
   In a 20-page decision, the three-judge appeals panel agreed with
Shoreham's owners that the state and local governments had
``obstructed the discovery process and failed to obey certain
(licensing) board orders ... and that the only appropriate sanction
is dismissal ....''
   However, the licensing board only had authority to dismiss the
governments in the case it was hearing, according to the appeals
board.
   Jim Lois, a spokesman for the Long Island Lighting Co., which
owns the embattled $5.3 billion plant, said the company will fight
Friday's ruling.
   ``Today's decision by the appeals board did not overrule the ...
licensing board decision on the merits of emergency planning, nor
did the appeals court overrule the findings that the intervening
New York governments had indeed acted willfully and in bad faith by
obstructing the judicial process,'' Lois said. ``We will appeal
today's decision directly to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.''
   Francis Sheehan, a spokesman for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said
the governor was studying the decision and would have no immediate
comment.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, in a ruling Sept. 23,
elimiminated New York state, Suffolk County and the Town of
Southampton as intervenors in a case involving an emergency
evacuation drill conducted earlier this year. The panel also found
that there was reasonable assurance that the public's safety could
be protected in the event of an accident at the reactor.
   By a 2-1 decision, the panel agreed with Long Island Lighting's
argument that ``realism'' dictated that in case of an actual
accident, state and local authorities would, in fact, cooperate
with emergency measures planned by the company even if they didn't
have their own plan.
   Current federal regulation prevents the NRC from issuing a
full-power license to a nuclear plant unless there is an emergency
plan that gives reasonable assurance the public will be safe if an
accident occurs.

   The second debate between presidential
candidates Michael Dukakis and George Bush will take place next
week in Los Angeles, a spokesman for the Commission on Presidential
Debates said Friday.
   Robert Neuman, director of media arrangements for the
commission, said the 90-minute debate will take place in Pauley
Pavilion on the campus of UCLA.
   The status of the second and final debate between Democrat
Dukakis and Republican Bush was thrown into question last week when
the original sponsor, the League of Women Voters, abruptly
withdrew, complaining that the two candidates' campaigns were
insisting on making all important decisions.
   The commission, which sponsored the first debate, took over
sponsorship, but could not reach agreement with the League to
obtain use of Shrine Auditorium which was to have been the site.
   Neuman said final arrangements still were being made between the
commission, the university and the city.
   The debate will be Thursday or Friday, depending on whether the
American League baseball play-offs go to a seventh game.
   Neuman said the debate would begin at 9 p.m. EDT and would
follow the format of the first debate in which the candidates
responded to questions from a panel of four reporters.
   The first debate was Sept. 25, in Winston-Salem, N.C., on the
campus of Wake Forest University.
   Vice presidential nominees Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle debated
Oct. 5, in Omaha, Neb.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fair weather settled over the middle of the nation Friday, and
cooler air was expected overnight in the middle Atlantic states and
the Ohio Valley, with frost warnings in the Carolinas.
   Temperatures were in the 50s and 60s over much of the Plains
states, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi and Ohio valleys and the
Atlantic coast. The pleasant temperatures were a result of an area
of high pressure that stretched from the middle Mississippi Valley
to New England.
   Readings were in the 70s over the southern half of Texas, the
Gulf Coast, the northern third of Florida and inland valleys of
California.
   In south central Texas, the southern two-thirds of Florida and
the desert Southwest, temperatures were in the 80s.
   In Arkansas, minor flooding of agricultural lowlands continued
along the Cache and St. Francis rivers.
   Rainshowers and fog continued over Oklahoma and western
Arkansas. Rainfall was generally light.
   Unstable air and an upper air disturbance were producing
rainshowers over the lower Great Lakes. The rain-cooled air was
holding temperatures in the 40s. Showers were also scattered over
eastern Virginia and eastern North Carolina.
   The northern Pacific Coast had temperatures in the 50s and was
shrouded by fog and drizzle.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were widely scattered over
northern New Mexico.
   Cool air was expected overnight in the mid-Atlantic states and
the Ohio Valley. A frost warning was posted for middle and
northwest South Carolina. Frost and freeze warnings were in effect
for the mountain regions of North Carolina.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 93 degrees at Phoenix; Yuma, Ariz.;
and Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, Ariz.
   The low in the nation Friday was 21 degrees at Houlton, Maine,
and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The National Weather Service forecast for Saturday called for
rainshowers over New England and New York state. Showers were to be
scattered over southern parts of Oklahoma. An upper air disturbance
was to produce cloudy skies over the upper Great Lakes and the
upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were to be in the 40s over the eastern half of
New England. A dome of high pressure was expected to keep
temperatures in the 50s over the middle Atlantic Coast, the central
and northern Appalachians, the upper Ohio Valley and the Great
Lakes.
   Readings were to reach the 80s over the south half of the
Florida peninsula, south central and southwest Texas, southern
parts of the Southern Plateau, the Great Basin, southern Idaho,
most of inland California and Oregon. Highs were expected between
90 and 105 degrees over the desert Southwest and the inland desert
valleys of California. The remainder of the nation was to have
highs in the 60s and 70s.

   Michael Dukakis attacked the Republicans
Friday for standing by while foreigners are ``buying up America,''
but he mistakenly told workers at a plant owned by Italians that
they were ``survivors'' in the international trade battles.
   The Democratic presidential nominee used the Moog Automotive Co.
plant as the backdrop for a speech blasting GOP vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle's statement Wednesday that he welcomed foreign
investment in U.S. factories, business and real estate.
   ``If anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just
remind them of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when Sen.
Quayle said he's happy that foreign owners are buying up America,''
Dukakis said.
   ``Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for
foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to
foreign owners _ but that's not the kind of future Lloyd Bentsen
and I and (Missouri Rep.) Dick Gephardt want for America,'' he
continued.
   Dukakis' comments caused one executive at the plant to ask
another whether the Democratic presidential candidate realized who
the plant's owners were.
   The Moog family sold the company more than 10 years ago to IFINT
USA, the American subsidiary of IFI of Turin, Italy. IFI is owned
by the Agnelli family, which also owns the automaker Fiat.
   Dukakis adviser Kirk O'Donnell said that officials at the
campaign headquarters were aware of the ownership prior to the
event. Another adviser, Thomas Herman, said that Dukakis himself
was not aware of the company's Italian owners.
   The Bush campaign took delight in what spokesman Mark Goodin
called Dukakis' gaffe.
   ``It occurs to me that that tank ride he took a few weeks ago
may have done more damage than I first suspected, even with his
protective head gear,'' Goodin said, referring to Dukakis' ride in
an army tank during a campaign visit to a defense plant.
   ``The bottom line is America is competing better overseas, we
are opening access to foreign markets, we are better controlling
the foreign trade deficit while the U.S. economy continues to
expand. As usual, the governor is out in left field somewhere,''
Goodin said.
   O'Donnell, Herman and other Dukakis aides moved quickly in an
effort to convince reporters that Dukakis was not criticizing Moog
or its owners but was opposed to the growing ``trend'' of foreign
investment in the United States.
   ``If you're going to talk about foreign invesment, that's the
kind of place to do it,'' O'Donnell said.
   But in his speech, Dukakis referred to the company as one of the
``few survivors'' of the auto parts industry's battle with foreign
competitors.
   ``Here at Moog Automotive, you know as well as anyone that
American businesses and American products and American jobs are
fighting for survival in the world marketplace,'' Dukakis said in
the speech. ``Whether or not we win that battle will determine
whether our children and grandchildren and generations to come
continue to enjoy an American standard of living.''
   Dukakis then departed from the text of his speech to tell the
workers he realized that they understood that message, telling the
workers, ``You are one of the few survivors.''
   O'Donnell said that Dukakis was not outrightly opposed to
foreign investment in the United States and noted that the company
had American management and was an exporter.
   In the speech, Dukakis told the union workers that Quayle is
``happy to hand a `For Sale' sign on America'' and that Bush ``has
spent the last eight years with a `Do Not Disturb' sign on his
office door.''
   In constrast, Dukakis said he and running mate Lloyd Bentsen
work aggressively to win access for U.S. products to foreign
markets and would offer protection to certain American industries
provided those companies agreed to modernize their plants and
retrain their workers to become more competitive.
   Dukakis denounced Reagan administration officials he said had
sought foreign help in fighting the recently passed trade bill and
also chided a former Reagan administration official who was seeking
a loobying job with Japanese auto parts manufactuers at the same
time he was representing the United States in trade negotiations
with Japanese auto parts makers.
   ``While (Bush has) been a summer soldier in the battle for
America's economic future, some of his colleagues in this
adminstration have been trying to enlist on the other side,''
Dukakis said. ``In a Dukakis White House, my friends, we're going
to fight for America's economic future. And we'll pledge allegiance
to only one flag _ Old Glory.''
   From Missouri, Dukakis was headed to North Carolina, another key
swing state where the Democratic ticket believes it has a good
chance to defeat Bush and Quayle. On Saturday the Massachusetts
governor was campaigning in Maine.

   A felony court acquitted a Greek
businessman of espionage Friday, although he admitted giving
details of the U.S.-built Stinger anti-aircraft missile to the
Soviet Union.
   The three-member court said Michalis Megaloconomou was innocent
on the ground the material handed over was not secret.
   ``Megaloconomou took unclassified materials for a well-known
weapons system. The Soviet Union wasn't going to build anything
from material it already had obtained from other people,''
Prosecutor Constantinos Androulikakis said in his summing up.
   The 40-year-old businessman told the court he gave 400
microfiche cards to a Soviet intelligence agent in April 1984 but
didn't know they contained information on the shoulder-fired
Stinger's trigger system.
   ``I thought they contained information on a telephone system,''
he said.
   Megaloconomou also told the court he traveled to the Soviet
Union in 1984 on a false passport and was given a miniature camera,
decoding pads and a radio receiver by a Soviet agent.
   The case was linked with the May 1985 defection in Athens of
Soviet agent Sergei Bokhane, whose revelations cast doubts on
Greece's capacity to safeguard NATO secrets and delayed the sale of
40 U.S.-made jet fighters to Greece.
   Brig. Ioannis Alexakis, a former head of counter-intelligence
for the Greek Central Intelligence Service, told the court
Wednesday Megaloconomou had been a Soviet spy for 10 years when he
was arrested in September 1985.
   But the prosecutor, addressing only the Stinger case, said, ``We
can't say he gave secrets to a foreign power and endangered the
security of Greece or its allies. Espionage is taking state secrets
with the intent of harming the nation.''
   Megaloconomou is a former deputy director at Standard Electric
Hellas, or SEH, a Greek company affiliated with the American
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., ITT.
   Also acquitted were two SEH employees, commercial director
Constantinos Libousakis and secretary Artmenis Tzirozidou, who were
tried on misdemeanor charges in the same court for violating state
secrets through negligence.
   SEH was among firms in six Western European countries that
manufactured Stinger components under license.
   Megaloconomou was arrested on the basis of information given to
the American CIA by Bokhane, who served as deputy head of the
Soviet Military Intelligence Agency, GRU, in Athens.
   Bokhane said Megaloconomou was recruited by the GRU in 1975 and
began selling them information in 1977, according to Alexakis.
   In a 1986 trial, a Greek navy officer and a Greek businessman
accused of selling information and telecommunications equipment to
Moscow were acquitted on the ground that Greek intelligence
services couldn't confirm Bokhane's allegations.
   The United States delayed approving the sale of the F-16
jetfighters to Greece until Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist
government signed an agreement in 1986 pledging to prevent advanced
Western technology from reaching the Soviet Union.

   South Korea on Friday urged North
Korea to begin trade and said it would drop trade barriers to
promote ties with its communist rival.
   If North Korea agrees, the trade will be treated as domestic
commerce with no tariffs, Rha Woong-bae, the deputy prime minister
and economic planning minister, told a news conference. He said the
trade will not include military products.
   Rha, South Korea's top economic official, called for a quick
start to trade both directly and through third nations. He also
called for talks on working out details of the commerce, which he
said would benefit both sides.
   South Korea, a U.S. ally, has improved its trade and other
relations with other communist nations, such as China.
   Rha listed coal, iron ore and corn as probable import items from
North Korea, and steel and textiles as likely South Korean exports
to the North.
   Any trade, either direct or through third nations, would depend
on North Korean consent. There are no indications the North would
accept trade with the South, and past efforts at improving
relations have had little success.
   The countries do not have any contacts or ties beyond a single
hotline. The border is sealed and both nations have been locked in
a bitter confrontation for 40 years.
   President Roh Tae-woo this week called for a major effort to end
the confrontation and work toward reunifying the Korean Peninsula.
Radical students have held violent demonstrations to press demands
for reunification.
   The countries were split at the end of World War II. North Korea
invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended with
an armistice in 1953. Talks on improving relations are to resume
Oct. 13 after deadlocking in August.
   The sides held five rounds of talks on economic cooperation in
1985, but the North stopped contacts in January 1986 to protest
U.S.-South Korean military training exercises.

   Four Turkish-speaking gunmen entered the
office of Chile's hononary consul Friday, hit him with a pistol
butt and fired a shot into the floor, officials reported.
   Mordo Dinar, Chile's honorary consul in Istanbul since 1953,
suffered a minor head injury in the attack at his law office,
according to Istanbul Gov. Cahit Bayar.Bayar said no group claimed
responsibility.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted witnesses as
saying the gunmen left behind banners saying, ``Down with
Pinochet!'' referring to Chilean President Augusto Pinochet and his
military government.
   Anatolia also reported Dinar expressed support for the results
of the Chilean referendum Wednesday when the voters rejected a
proposal that Pinochet, who also is commander of the army, serve as
president until 1997.
   The agency quoted Dinar as saying, ``I hoisted the Chilean flag
at the building today for the first time in 15 years to join the
Chilean people celebrating the results of the referendum, and will
keep it there.''
   Pinochet led the military coup in September 1973 that ousted the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.

   A Beirut magazine said Friday the captors
of Anglican church envoy Terry Waite will free him ``very soon''
and American hostages will be released before the U.S. presidential
election Nov. 8.
   Ash-Shiraa said two other British hostages will be freed with
Waite, who has been missing since January 1987. Al-Anwar, a
conservative daily newspaper based in Christian east Beirut, said
Waite would be freed within 72 hours.
   An Israeli newpaper said the United States made a deal with Iran
to free American hostages in exchange for delivery of arms and
spare parts through South Korea. U.S. officials denied the report.
   Lebanese police said two unidentified foreigners kidnapped in
Moslem west Beirut 21 months ago were Czechoslovak businessmen held
only a few days.
   That leaves 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans.
   The Anglican church and British government said they had no
information about Waite.
   Both Beirut publications have been inaccurate in recent reports
about hostages. But Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west Beirut,
correctly revealed in November 1986 that the United States had
secretly delivered arms to Iran.
   The report about arms in The Nation, a new English-language
Israeli weekly, was not attributed. It said the U.S. government
also agreed to pay $7 million ransom to Shiite Moslem extremists
holding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity from
prosecution.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied the report but
said there were ``a lot of free-lancers, independent operators in
the region.'' On Thursday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Washington was not dealing with Iran and that ``Anyone who tries to
cut across our policies should butt out.''
   President Reagan refused questions about the reports as he left
for a speaking engagement in Detroit. Fitzwater, traveling with
him, said there was ``nothing new'' on any hostages.
   The British Foreign Office said of the Waite story: ``We have
nothing that would indicate this is anything different from all the
hundreds of previous reports.''
   Lambeth Palace, London headquarters of the archbishop of
Canterbury, said: ``We have not heard anything here and in view of
the sort of relationships we have established, we would be likely
to hear something.''
   Waite, personal emissary of Archbishop Robert Runcie,
disappeared after leaving his west Beirut hotel to meet with a
group holding hostages, including American Terry Anderson.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the foreigner held
longest.
   Britain's recent decision to restore full diplomatic relations
with Iran ``provided efforts currently under way to release Waite
and his countrymen with a strong impetus,'' Ash-Shiraa reported.
   The other British hostages are journalist Alec Collett,
kidnapped March 25, 1985, and television news producer John
McCarthy, seized April 17, 1986. Hostage Brian Keenan, held since
April 11, 1986, is Irish but also holds a British passport.
   On April 23, 1986, a group calling itself the Revolutionary
Organization of Socialist Moslems said it had killed Collett. A
videotape purporting to show him hanged was made public, but no
body was found.
   Ash-Shiraa quoted a security source it did not name as saying
the release Monday of Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian who is a
resident U.S. alien, marked ``the beginning of the release of more
American hostages.''
   ``The source said American hostages would be released before the
U.S. presidential elections,'' it said without further elaboration.
   Fitzwater, asked whether the U.S. government was involved in
negotiations or deals for Singh's release, replied: ``That's not
true.''
   Singh was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, by a pro-Iranian group
calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. Taken
with him from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University
College were American teachers Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and
Jesse Turner.
   
   The Nation report said that two weeks before Singh's release,
South Korean Oil Minister Lee Bong signed an agreement in Tehran to
sell to Iran millions of dollars in spare parts for Iran's
U.S.-made armaments.
   It also said Iran agreed to provide the $7 million ransom
demanded by the kidnappers because the United States did not want
to appear to be purchasing their freedom.
   The money would be paid indirectly to the kidnappers by Iran in
the form of commissions for Iranian purchases in the United States,
according to The Nation.
   It said the deal was struck after a group of U.S. citizens who
hold Iranian and Lebanese passports were permitted to visit
Anderson and one other American hostage in January.
   Giora Shamis, owner of the news service that sold the story to
The Nation, told The Associated Press the report was based on
interviews with three of about 15 dual-passport holders involved in
the contacts as well as South Korean sources. Shamis's news
service, Depth, is based in London.
   Al-Anwar quoted two sources it did not identify in the report on
Waite.
   It said one reported Waite ``has been moved from the Bekaa
valley to Beirut's southern suburbs and predicted he will be
released in 72 hours,'' but the other said he would be freed when
Britain restores diplomatic relations with Syria.
   Britain severed relations in November 1986, accusing Syria of
involvement in a plot to blow up an Israeli airliner.
   Syria is an ally of Iran and has said it was working for release
of all hostages held in Lebanon. Most are in the hands of Shiite
Moslems loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iran's
fundamentalist revolution.
   Syria has an estimated 40,000 soldiers stationed in Moslem
sectors of Beirut and northern and eastern Lebanon, including the
Bekaa valley.
   Police said the freed Czechoslovaks were taken to Damascus in a
convoy of evacuees from Beirut a week after their abduction Jan.
26, 1987.
   ``The kidnappers must have mistaken the blond pair for
Westerners and released them after discovering the error,'' a
spokesman said privately.

   The government has denied Amnesty
International's reports of political assassinations and political
prisoners in Mexico, saying they ``deform reality.''
   The London-based human rights organization said Wednesday in its
annual report that it continued to receive complaints from Mexico
of arbitrary arrests and assassinations of members of groups
frequently related to land disputes.
   ``Many assassinations were attributed to civilian gunmen linked
to landowners but seemed to have the consent of the authorities,''
the report said.
   The Interior Ministry released a communique Thursday saying the
government expressed its ``absolute rejection'' of the allegations.
   ``Amnesty International's mention of the existence of political
prisoners in Mexico is unfounded,'' it said.
   It also said the government made a detailed check of cases
mentioned by Amnesty and found the cases were properly described by
Mexican police and judicial authorities as involving common crimes
``without the influence of any kind of political situation.''
   The ministry said Amnesty ``distributes reports without checking
the facts and without an opportune presentation to the government
of our country.''
   Amnesty International said it was in communication with the
government by letter and visits by government representatives to
the organization.
   Its annual report said at least 23 people adopted as ``prisoners
of conscience'' by the organization remain in jail. Some of the
prisoners have been sentenced for crimes such as robbery, assault
and homicide the report said but it added ``it seems these charges
were imposed for political motives, for legal, peaceful activities
as campesino or community leaders.''

   Four Americans sailed into Laotian
waters Friday and floated dollar bills stamped with a $2.4 million
reward offer for missing U.S. servicemen.
   Thai navy boats waved the group back to shore and retrieved the
money, but the Americans said they threw it back into the Mekong
River.
   The Americans tossed sealed plastic envelopes containing a total
of about $1,000 into the river after their two rented fishing boats
moved about 220 yards into Laotian waters. The Mekong forms a
boundary between Laos and Thailand and flows to Cambodia and
Vietnam.
   They also stuffed U.S. and Soviet currency into a toy boat
guided by remote control toward Laos.
   ``We are really encouraged. We had a great day,'' said Bruce
Adams, of Laramie, Wyo.
   Adams and the other three belong to a private lobbying group
called the National Steering Committee for American War Veterans.
They believe Americans taken prisoner during the Indochina war are
still held in communist Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
   Those three governments deny holding any Americans.
   Adams is convinced his brother Stephen remains captive in Laos
since he was reported missing 22 years ago.
   Laotian authorities captured two other members of the group
Sunday after they sailed into the same general area, tossed the
same reward offers into the river, then apparently landed at a
Laotian village.
   The U.S. Embassy in Vientiene said it has received no response
to its inquiry about the Americans _ Donna Long of Jacksonville,
N.C., and James Copp of Hampstead, N.C.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., was quoted by The Linton (Ind.)
Daily Citizen newspaper as saying Friday the State Department told
him the two are held in a compound in Vientiene, capital of Laos.
   ``The State Department is confident they will be out in a short
time,'' McCloskey was quoted as saying. ``I'm very optimistic they
will be released in a short time.''
   The Thai navy boat asked the Americans to stop tossing the
packets, waved them back to Thai shores, then began retrieving the
money.
   ``It won't work. It's incredibly stupid,'' one Thai officer told
reporters.
   The navy boat then escorted Ted Sampley, the group leader, to a
navy station where he was told the group's actions were not
allowed. An officer returned 90 packets of dollar bills to Sampley,
and the former Green Beret from Kingston, N.C., said he would have
to toss them back into the river.
   ``So we tossed them into the river from the Thai side and all
the kids enjoyed plunging into the Mekong to get them,'' said
Sampley.
   Lynn Hampton of Winter Haven, Fla., handed out balloons and
reward stickers to youngsters. Ms. Hampton was a nurse during the
Vietnam War.
   The other member of the group, William Sullivan of Jacksonville,
N.C., was in the Marine Corps during the war.
   The $2.4 million is being offered to any Laotian, Cambodian or
Vietnamese who brings out an American war prisoner. The money was
pledged by 21 U.S. congressmen and citizens.
   About 58,000 Americans died before U.S. forces withdrew from the
Vietnam War in 1973, and the U.S. government still lists 2,393
Americans as missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   Thai navy officials said the group's entry into Laotian waters
could jeopardize Thai-Laotian relations.
   The U.S. government also has criticized the reward offer as an
impediment to official contacts with the Indochinese governments to
account for the missing servicemen.

   Friday was the last day on the air for radio
station WNBC, for 62 years the flagship of the NBC radio network
that was home to Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Fred Allen and the NBC
Symphony conducted by Arturo Toscanini.
   Its spot at 660 on the AM dial, a clear-channel signal that
could be picked up in as many as 35 states at night, is going to an
all-sports station.
   WNBC was descended from the station that was the first to
broadcast a World Series, the first to run a commercial, the first
with a coast-to-coast hookup and the first to broadcast a national
political convention.
   At the end of the show, everyone in the studio counted down from
10, but the power was turned off before NBC's distinctive
three-gong chime could sound for the last time. The switch was
thrown at 5:30 p.m.
   The end of an era came as a result of the $6 billion deal in
1985 in which General Electric Co. bought RCA Corp., the NBC's
parent company.
   A Federal Communications Commission regulation prevents a new
owner from keeping both a TV and radio station in the same market,
so GE decided to sell its new radio properties and keep the more
profitable WNBC-TV.
   The NBC radio network went to Westwood One for $55 million, and
five stations, including WNBC, were sold to Emmis Broadcasting
Corp. for $121.5 million. GE has one station left, KNBR in San
Francisco, which is for sale.
   Emmis decided to ditch WNBC's call letters and format and move
in its WFAN, a local all-sports station that held the less
desirable frequency of 1050.
   The new station signed on from its studios in Queens at 5:30
p.m., with the words, ``Sports radio 66 W-F-A-N.''
   About 50 WNBC employees, including its on-air personalities,
have known since February they would be out of jobs, but none
jumped ship ahead of time, said general manager Peg Kelly.
   ``People sort of want to be here for the end,'' she said. ``No
one's thrilled about it; no one even likes it. But it's kind of a
piece of history, and people want to be here for it.''
   WNBC said goodbye with a 90-minute retrospective program Friday
featuring clips from programs with Benny, Hope, Allen and Fibber
McGee and Molly.
   NBC also had such classic shows as ``Amos 'n' Andy,'' ``Your Hit
Parade'' and ``Information, Please.'' There were also the original
soap operas, like ``Ma Perkins'' and ``Mary Noble, Backstage Wife.''
   The station, then owned by AT&T, went on the air in April 1922
as W2XY. It became WBAY in July that year and was changed to WEAF
the next month.
   RCA bought the station from AT&T for $1 million in 1926 when it
formed NBC to help sell the radios it was making, but it didn't
change the call letters to WNBC until 1946.
   The first radio commercial was broadcast on WEAF on Aug. 28,
1922, when a real estate developer paid $100 for a 10-minute
announcement to advertise apartments.
   ``Up to that point radio was for experimenters and people were
still thinking of ways to make money with it,'' said WNBC program
director Dale Parsons, one of those losing a job.
   WEAF's other firsts included the first World Series broadcast,
Yankees vs. Giants, in 1923; the first coast-to-coast hookup, in
1924, and the first broadcast of the national political
conventions, in 1924. In 1925, it broadcast a presidential
inaugural address _ Calvin Coolidge's _ for the first time.

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   DAN QUAYLE, shrugging off new Democratic campaign commercials
aimed at raising doubts about his fitness for high office: ``We can
stand the heat. We're going to stay in the kitchen. George Bush is
going to be the next president of the United States. The voters
will vote for him.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, breaking down into laughter while scoffing at
Republican assertions that Quayle did well in the vice presidential
debate: ``I was reading the paper this morning where George Bush
said he thought won that, and yet every ... I'm sorry.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, unaware he is speaking at an auto parts plant
that is foreign-owned, blasting Quayle's debate-night assertion
that he welcomed foreign investment in the United States: ``If
anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just remind them
of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when Sen. Quayle said
he's happy that foriegn owners are buying up America.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, accusing Dukakis of taking a soft approach to crime
and calling the Massachusetts criminal justice system out of whack:
``(It is) a `Twilight Zone' world where prisoners' right to privacy
had more weight than the citizens' right to safety.''

   President Reagan came to Dan Quayle's defense on
Friday, portraying the embattled vice presidential candidate as a
man who shares Reagan's conservative beliefs and should help carry
on his policies.
   In a series of speeches designed to win support for Vice
President George Bush and his running mate among middle-class and
blue-collar voters, Reagan mentioned Quayle more than he usually
does on campaign trips.
   He praised Quayle's performance in his face-off against the
Democratic vice presidential candidate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   ``One thing's even clearer to me after watching the debate
Wednesday night _ the Bush-Quayle ticket will continue the policies
of peace and prosperity that have, as Dan said, made this great
nation `the envy of the world,''' Reagan told a cheering group of
several hundred business leaders.
   To a screaming, flag-waving crowd of 10,000 students and
residents in nearby Sterling Heights earlier in the day, Reagan
said with a grin, ``America's economy is a Grand Prix racer, and
the way to keep it on track is to give George Bush and Dan Quayle a
checkered flag in their race in November.''
   Late Friday, the president spoke at a $1,000-per-plate GOP
fund-raiser and attempted to counter the idea that Quayle's
performance had cost votes.
   ``The other night ... the Washington establishment was betting
against him,'' Reagan said. ``But I tell you, the smart money was
riding on a great senator, by the name of Dan Quayle. He got my
vote. How about yours?''
   Reagan then predicted that in November, ``the American people
will be investing in a new option for the American engine _ I call
it the George Bush turbocharger. And when that happens, all I can
say is, Put the pedal to the metal and watch America go.''
   Reagan's references to Quayle came amid an apparent Republican
damage-control effort to blunt criticism of Quayle's performance in
the Omaha, Neb., debate. Instant polls conducted after the event
showed the public, by a wide margin, believed Bentsen had handily
beaten Quayle in the debate.
   The president said, ``The liberals are saying they want to help
the American middle class. And what they're planning to do ... is
to tax them and tax them and tax them some more. If you ask me, the
liberals are selling the middle class short.''
   He said the nation had enjoyed economic good times during his
eight years in office and suggested that the economic hardship the
state endured as the auto industry suffered might return under a
Democratic administration.
   ``And you may have heard that I kind of like what George Bush
said about this election _ `when you have to change horses in
midstream, doesn't it make sense to switch to one who's going the
same way,''' he said.
   After Reagan ended his speech, a man claiming he had been the
subject of government mind control experiments disrupted the event,
making a long and rambling argument that he had been mistreated.
   Secret Service agents, apparently determining that he was not a
physical threat to Reagan, made no attempt to approach the man, who
identified himself as William McKnight, 58. He gave no address or
hometown.
   Reagan, angered by what he called an ``unfair'' disruption of
the dinner guests, finally shouted into the microphone that if the
man had a complaint, he should ``put it in a letter and send it to
me.''
   Reagan's visit was a homecoming of sorts, since it was in
Detroit's Joe Louis Arena in July 1980 that the former California
governor accepted his party's nomination for the first time _ and
chose Bush to be his running mate.
   Reagan recalled the time as ``a magical moment'' and ``one of
the proudest moments of my life.''
   Most experts rate Michigan a tossup, though Bush campaign
adviser Lee Atwater said earlier this week that Bush campaign
figures showed the vice president ahead in the state by seven to
eight points. The state went to Reagan, 59 percent to 40 percent,
in 1984.

   An outboard-motor manufacturer has agreed to pay
for a $20 million cleanup of toxic PCBs in Lake Michigan's Waukegan
Harbor, ending years of bitter haggling over the Superfund site,
officials announced Friday.
   Under a consent decree signed by Outboard Marine Corp. and
federal and state officials, thousands of pounds of toxic
polychlorinated biphenyls will be removed, treated and safely
stored, state Attorney General Neil Hartigan said.
   ``This is a major environmental victory,'' Hartigan said, noting
that no taxpayer dollars will be used in the cleanup.
   Waukegan Harbor, an important Great Lakes port at Waukegan, 25
miles north of Chicago, has been listed on the federal Superfund
list of environmental hazards and at one time was considered
Illinois' worst pollution problem.
   Contamination of the harbor began in 1961, when hydraulic fluid
containing PCBs leaked from the hydraulic systems at the company's
Waukegan plant into waste waters, which were dumped into Lake
Michigan and onto plant property.
   Public health officials have advised against eating fish from
the harbor. PCBs have been shown to cause tumors in laboratory
animals and are suspected to cause cancer in humans.
   ``We obviously believe that it's time to get this matter
resolved,'' said company spokesman Laurin Baker in a telephone
interview from Outboard Marine's Waukegan headquarters.
   While saying it is ``hard to be happy over spending $20 million
in company assets,'' Baker called the decree ``the best settlement
possible.''
   The case became entangled in the legal system as company
officials first argued PCBs posed no threat to humans, then barred
from their facilities federal environmental officials seeking to
determine the extent of the pollution, said U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency spokesman John Perrecone.
   After changes in the federal Superfund law in 1986 allowed the
EPA such access, the company agreed to negotiate with state and
federal authorities, Perrecone said.
   Under terms of Friday's consent decree, Outboard Marine will
begin cleaning up the PCBs next spring and should complete the task
by 1992. The company will remove and treat contaminated material
from both the harbor and its property.
   ``The agreement called for us to remove and treat sediments and
soils that have the highest levels of contamination and encapsulate
the remaining low-level soils and sediments in three areas,'' Baker
said.
   Outboard Marine is a $1.3 billion manufacturer of recreational
marine products and other recreational materials.

   Republican George Bush accused Democratic
rival Michael Dukakis on Friday of being soft on criminals while
displaying ``an astounding lack of insensitivity, a lack of human
compassion'' for the victims of crime.
   He assailed the prisoner-furlough program in Massachusetts as a
``stupid law'' and charged that Dukakis, as governor, had presided
over a criminal-justice system ``completely out of whack and
certainly out of touch with, I'd say, what are the grass-roots
values of the American people, a `Twilight Zone' world where
prisoners' right of privacy has more weight than citizens' right to
safety.''
   Bush said Dukakis, in his first year as governor, vetoed a bill
to repeal furloughs for first-degree murderers. Moreover, he said
Dukakis ``has never apologized'' to a Maryland couple that was
terrorized in 1987 by a Massachusetts prisoner, a convicted
murderer, who was released on a weekend leave.
   Lending weight to Bush's attack, the Maryland man who was
assaulted, Cliff Barnes, was in California on Friday taping radio
ads for Bush's campaign.
   With three dozen uniformed police officers on stage with him,
Bush made his charge in a speech before a supportive audience of
nearly 1,000 people. A large spillover crowd waited outside and
cheered Bush as he departed.
   The attack was part of a determined strategy to win the support
of undecided, swing voters _ mostly blue-collar, Catholic,
Democrats _ by accentuating issues such as crime, the death
penalty, abortion and taxes, while portraying Dukakis as a liberal
who is out of step with mainstream America. Bush's advisers believe
the swing voters could tilt the balance in a close election.
   Campaigning in a key battleground state where 23 electoral votes
are at stake, Bush spoke first in Xenia and then flew to Cleveland
for a courthouse rally in nearby Medina, where he got a tumultuous
welcome from a crowd of thousands.
   Bush didn't mention his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, in any of
his three speeches, but in answer to a question from a reporter
expressed renewed confidence in Quayle.
   Closing out a week of appearances, Bush spoke at a rally in
Lee's Summit, Mo., and then went to Kansas City, Mo., where he
received the endorsement of former FBI chief Clarence Kelley, a
fellow Republican.
   While saying he did not know Dukakis, Kelley told reporters
``I'm tired of reading accounts of the inadequacies or derogatory
statements made about George Bush.''
   Kelley said Bush had served as chief of the CIA while he was
head of the FBI and that ``on many occasions he took a very firm
stand, regardless of what the consequences might be to him
personally.''
   While sharpening his assault on Dukakis, Bush defended himself
against charges he is waging a negative campaign. ``I don't believe
it is negative to try to clarify honestly and hopefully fairly the
distinctions with one's opponents. That is the business of
political campaigns.''
   In great detail, Bush recounted the story of Willie Horton, a
convicted murderer who went on a crime spree in Maryland after he
escaped during a weekend prison furlough from Massachusetts. Bush
has talked about Horton before, but never before in as much depth.
   Bush said Horton, ``a cold-blooded killer, broke into the home
of a Maryland couple, Cliff and Angi Barnes, sadistically torturing
the man, raping and torturing his fiancee and repeatedly
threatening to kill them both.
   In Boston, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach responded to Bush. He
said, ``Michael Dukakis is not going to play politics with the
victims of crime. He said it was a tragedy and the law has been
changed.''
   Bush said that when people tried to look into the furlough
program ``the governor's administration stonewalled, citing _ and
this is no joke _ the prisoner's right to privacy.''
   Moreover, Bush said about Dukakis, ``though he had met with the
families of prisoners, he now refused to meet the victims and their
families.''
   Families of crime victims collected more than 52,000 signatures
in a petition drive to put a repeal referendum on the ballot. Bush
said that ``under the bright spotlight of the presidential
campaign, the governor finally relented'' and signed the repeal.
   Bush said, ``in all this time, as far as I know, the governor
has never acknowledged that his furlough program was a tragic
mistake.''
   He said, ``while the governor has shown great compassion for the
difficulties of prisoners and their families _ and no doubt their
hardships are severe _ when it comes to the plights of the victims
and their families, there is what one can only describe as an
astounding lack of sensitivity, a lack of human compassion.Bush
said, ``I hope I'm wrong about this but I don't think so, in the
year since it happened, the governor of Massachusetts has never
aplogized to the Barnes for their ordeal.''
   In Medina, Bush said the federal government does not furlough
murderers who have not served enough time to be eligible for a
parole.
   Even so, Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the vice
president feels the federal furlough program ``should be reviewed''
for possible changes. Fuller said Bush was satisfied it was
``fundamentally different'' than the former Massachussetts program.

<HEAD>Oliver North Lecture Draws Criticism at Boston College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Boston College students say
Oliver North isn't worth the $25,000 the student government is
paying him to speak at the school and stepped up a petition drive
Friday to get the invitation withdrawn.
   The disgruntled students, who gathered 550 signatures by Friday
afternoon, say North's fee for the Nov. 2 appearance is too steep
and the retired Marine lieutenant colonel won't inspire discussion
worth the price.
   ``It's a mistake that brings profound embarrassment to the
entire Boston College community,'' said Carter Wilkie, 22, a senior
English major from Wilmington, Del., who helped organize the
petition drive. ``This whole episode shows that crime kind of does
pay.''
   But David McAuley, executive vice president of the student
government board, called North one of the most popular figures of
the decade and said the 90-minute lecture will attract a broad
range of students.
   ``Overall, this is a great opportunity to listen to a man
responsible for one of the great shake-ups in our government's
history,'' McAuley said.
   North faces trial on 16 charges of conspiracy to defraud the
government in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scheme. He has
given more than 25 speeches in the last year to raise money for his
defense.
   Jean Graham, editor-in-chief of The Heights, an independent
student weekly newspaper at the school, said many students were
dissatified about not being included in the decision.
   The decision ``without the approval of anyone else other than
the cabinet members is unfair,'' she said.
   She wrote an editorial against the choice of North.
   The money for the lecture would come from a student activities
fund for the school's 8,500 undergraduates through a mandatory $41
student assessment, said Douglas J. Whiting, the college's director
of communications. The money can be spent at the discretion of the
student government board.
   Whiting said that in the past, the fund had been used for
several lectures, but this year, the board voted to spend most of
it for North's appearance.
   Last year, former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado and former U.S.
Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork lectured at at the school for a
combined charge of less than $30,000, Whiting said.

<TEXT>
   An underground coal fire discovered by
children when sticks they poked into the ground caught fire has
been extinguished by firefighters with water and synthetic foam
into holes bored into the earth.
   No houses in the southeast Ohio city of 5,000 people were
damaged by the fire, which had covered a 40-by-40-foot area, but it
had threatened as many as 30 homes.
   ``We were lucky to get to it in its infancy,'' Fire Chief Tim
Baden said Friday.
   The burning material, waste coal believed to have come from an
unmapped mine abandoned in the 1920s, was 4 feet deep. It was
discovered Sept. 30.
   On Wednesday and Thursday, firefighters drilled holes about the
size of fire extinguishers into the ground to determine the area of
the fire, Baden said. Once isolated, additional holes were dug
throughout the area and water was poured into them.
   ``That is a quenching effect. The quenching essentially would
take away the heat,'' the chief said.
   After another dousing of water, firefighters capped the holes
with a synthetic material, which Baden described as a type of
firefighting foam used to fight oil fires by smothering them.
   ``What that essentially does is knock out the oxygen. That way
we keep all the oxygen out of it,'' Baden said.
   Officials determined after additional core samples taken Friday
that the fire died out.
   Baden said the fire entered a coal seam and could have burned
indefinitely had it not been extinguished immediately.

   Ambassador Maung Maung Gyi of Burma said
Friday the military government has imposed ``a reasonable measure
of stability'' and is preparing for free elections to establish
democracy.
   He defended the military government's crackdown on political
unrest and protest after the Sept. 18 coup. Burma has been ruled by
repressive military governments since Gen. Ne Win seized power in
1962.
   Maung Maung Gyi told the General Assembly his country has has
gone through ``a crisis ... turmoil and unrest when unavoidable
incidents occur.''
   Authorities ``are making arrangements for holding general
elections that will be free and fair, in which all political
parties can participate, so that the multiparty democratic system .
.. may be fully established,'' he said.
   ``When there is a need to establish law and order and when ...
the nation is threatened, it is the duty and obligation of the
authorities of state to assume their responsibilities to overcome
such difficulties.''
   ``The prevailing situation today is that our nation is
overcoming the period of disruption and has achieved a reasonable
measure of stability.''
   In Rangoon, two more political parties registered on Friday,
bringing to nine the number that have gained official recognition
and the right to run candidates.
   Rangoon radio said one person was killed when soldiers opened
fire on about 100 people removing corrugated iron roofing from an
already looted cigarette factory in a northern Rangoon suburb.
   The government has said about 440 people have been killed since
Gen. Saw Maung's coup three weeks ago.
   Japan, West Germany and the United States have suspended aid to
Burma, although Washington has said it would continue humanitarian
assistance and Japan said Friday it will provide $450,000 in
emergency food aid through the U.N. Children's Fund.
   ``This doesn't mean we approve of Saw Maung's military
government,'' Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said in Tokyo.

<HEAD>City's West Side Takes Off The Wraps After Aerial Pesticide
Spraying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents removed wraps of plastic Friday
from their cars but found little goo from an overnight aerial
spraying of pesticide, the first step in an attack against the
crop-threatening Mediterranean fruit fly.
   Three helicopters dropped 1,400 gallons of the pesticide
Malathion over a 35-square-mile area where about 100,000 people
live, brightening the night sky with floodlights and causing
commotion as they buzzed over houses.
   ``It was like Rambo,'' said resident Bill Kerwin. ``It was fun.
I took pictures.''
   William Edwards, chief deputy to the county agriculture
commissioner, said the spraying was critical in eradicting the
destructive Medfly. Officials also plan a quarantine of fruits and
vegetables from leaving the area and the release of 40 million
sterile Medflies to mate with the surviving Medflies to forestall
breeding.
   The fly threatens 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables and is
considered a serious threat to California's $15.5 billion farm
economy.
   Residents worried about the effect of the gooey spray on their
health and cars had jammed a county spraying hot line with hundreds
of calls, but police and county health officials reported no
complaints Friday.
   Citizens kept pets inside and covered cars or parked them inside
garages and shopping malls to prepare for the five-hour attack,
which ended 1:30 a.m. Friday.
   The area sprayed included the cities of Beverly Hills and West
Hollywood and two of the area's most popular shopping districts,
posh Rodeo Drive and trendy Melrose Avenue.
   ``There's no smell. The bags looked clean,'' said Rick Aronson,
manager of Paulee Auto Shop, which spent $500 on plastic bags to
cover up its fleet of 180 high-priced autos.
   Business tripled at the Beverly Hills Car Wash on La Cienega
Boulevard and the Santa Palma ``Car Wash of the Stars'' on Santa
Monica Boulevard.
   County and state agricultural officials ordered the spraying
after 48 Medflies were found in traps in the Palms area since Sept.
26. But the plan to spray the pesticide and corn syrup mixture
worried residents.
   Agriculture officials insisted the pesticide is harmless to
humans, and said it should immediately begin killing Medflies who
will feed on the sweetened potion that clings to produce, trees and
bushes.

   Firebombs exploded at
bookstores in downtown Durban and a white suburb Friday afternoon,
slightly injuring two people and causing minor damage, police
reported.
   The first blast occurred at about 2 p.m. in the Central News
Agency bookstore in suburban Pinetown, police said, and two people
suffered minor cuts. They said another about two hours later
damaged a Central News Agency branch in the city.
   Police initially said they had found a bomb at the downtown
store and did not mention an explosion until hours later.
   Six people were hurt Thursday, one seriously, when a bomb
exploded outside municipal offices of a mixed-race township near
Johannesburg, police reported. They said the bomb, placed in a
trash bin, damaged windows and walls of the municipal building in
Tembisa township.
   Three men and three women were wounded, police said. The
government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said one woman was
in serious condition.
   Bombings have occurred almost daily in recent weeks and the 29
in September were the most ever in a single month.
   Police blame virtually all of them on the African National
Congress, the main black guerrilla group fighting to bring down the
white-minority government.
   They say the ANC has intensified bombing in an attempt to
disrupt nationwide municipal elections scheduled for Oct. 26.
   About 150 bombings have been reported since President P.W.
Botha's government declared a state of emergency June 12, 1986.

<HEAD>Italian Fashions Have a Relaxed Style for Summer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The curtain has come down on Milan's fashion
runways with audiences confident that spring-summer 1989 will be a
good year for Italy's designers.
   After the shock treatment of last year's miniskirts, intended to
revive exports that slipped about 2 percent from 1986 to 1987, it
appeared time to relax.
   For the moment, Paris fashion seems to have the lead on
creativity, riding in the wake of Christian LaCroix's vivid
imagination, but buyers still look to Italy for well-tailored
clothes.
   ``These collections are very saleable,'' said Elin Saltzman,
fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue, of the five-day Italian
ready-to-wear showings that ended Thursday.
   The look for next summer is soft and serene. Gone is the
aggressiveness of a bold hemline, a hugged hip or a bulky padded
shoulder.
   Instead the accent is on a rounded silhouette with small
shoulders, tapered waistline and long loose hemlines. There is
frequent use of rose and cream-colored shades.
   Pants, out during the miniskirt craze but reinstated in March as
the dominant winter look, continued their popularity. Mainly they
are ample and often cropped at the calf. Another favorite is the
high-waisted sailor pant.
   Nautical themes pop up throughout the collections from the
profuse use of navy blue and blue and white striping to sailor-suit
collars on white blouses and jackets.
   The lore of the exotic influenced the collections with
low-waisted sarong skirts and pants, bolero jackets, Chinese prints
and Indian embroidery.
   Laura Biagiotti brought 20 Chinese models to Milan from Beijing
for her collection.
   Following in alphabetical order are glimpses of who offers what
for spring and summer:
   Armani _ Soft daytime suits in silk tweeds and evening wear in
diaphanous chiffon and embroidered silk.
   Basile _ Feminine blazers and long pants or skirts by day,
strapless chiffon gowns by night.
   Byblos _ Carioca skirts, calypso pants and tropical wrap around
skirts.
   Fendi _ A schoolgirl look in pleated linen carried into the
night by demure touches such as lace collars and floral embroidery.
   Ferre _ Nautical in an almost exclusive preference for navy blue
or blue and white stripes.
   Genny _ Tightest and shortest look on the runway with toreador
pants and short-skirted black suits.
   Gigli _ Waif-like with knotted hemlines and long sleeves.
   Krizia _ Sporty jackets and jumpers for daytime and Milan's
prettiest evening gown in tea rose silk organza.
   Missoni _ Back to his artistry in Murano glass and Gustav Klimt
designs for sumptuous knitwear.
   Mario Valentino _ Leather patchworked or embroidered to look
like fabric in bright citrus shades or muted tones.
   Versace _ High waists on pants and skirts with a preference for
black and white, a night-look in transparent chiffon tops.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Report To Continue Controversial Dam Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament adopted a government report
Friday recommending continuation of a controversial dam project on
the Danube River, following a heated eight-hour debate broadcast
live on Hungarian television.
   The vote to adopt was 317 for, 19 against, with 31 abstaining.
   Hungary is building the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power
plant and dam jointly with Czechoslovakia, with Austria financing
part of the Hungarian side of the project in return for electric
power.
   The project has run into heavy opposition in Hungary. Dozens of
independent environmental interest groups and others are demanding
construction be halted, claiming it will cause irreparable
ecological damage to wetland and wildlife along the Danube and
pollute large drinking water reserves.
   Environment Minister Laszlo Marothy argued Thursday that halting
the project would put a burden of $140 million to $200 milliion a
year on the economy until the mid-1990s. He said that would include
investing in substitute energy sources, restoring the landscape,
and compensation payments to Austria and Czechoslovakia.
   Officials estimated this year that the cost of completing the
dam would be about $1.08 billion while stopping construction would
cost about $1.1 billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will
push costs to $2.6 billion.
   Janos Szentagothai, former president of the Academy of Sciences,
on Friday told Parliament the academy adopted a unanimous decision
in 1983 proposing the government halt work on the project but this
was never made public.
   The deputies argued at length over conflicting motions _ one for
a roll-call vote and the other for a vote behind closed doors.
   Istvan Avar, a prominent actor and member of Parliament, broke
the deadlock finally by proposing that both groups withdraw their
motions and that the vote be taken by standing up.
   A roll-call vote is rare in Communist Hungary's legislature,
traditionally accustomed to giving rubber-stamp approval to
government decisions by a show of hands. The public wrangle was
another indication of the increasing openness in Hungary.

<TEXT>
   Author Tadeusz Konwicki wants Poland's
tallest building, named in honor of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin,
to be turned into a symbol to honor the victims of Stalinism, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   The Kurier Polski said Konwicki made the suggestion in an
interview after the paper asked people how Poland might best honor
victims of Stalinist repression.
   ``I think the best (symbolic) mausoleum for the victims would be
our Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science, which in fact was built
by Stalin and his supporters,'' Konwicki was quoted as saying.
   The wedding-cake style building that towers above Warsaw was a
gift to communist Poland from Stalin. Completed in 1955, it is
officially named the Josef Stalin Palace of Culture and Science.
   Konwicki said a neon sign that partially obstructs the name of
Stalin etched into the facade of the 772-foot-tall building should
be taken down so Stalin's name can be seen clearly.
   ``That would be a symbol of the whole matter,'' Konwicki said.
   A Konwicki novel, ``A Minor Apocalypse,'' published in 1979,
used the image of the building deteriorating to symbolize corrosion
of the communist system.
   Other Poles interviewed suggested erecting monuments to
Stalinist victims.
   A history teacher said publishing a history book ``with no blank
spots'' would be a fitting tribute.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle, reacting to television ads aimed at him by the Dukakis
campaign, said Friday his new role was to ``take all the heat and
the criticism'' from the Democrats and he would do it ``very
energetically.''
   ``We're delighted to be the lightning rod for the campaign,''
Quayle said, ``instead of have the heat and the target be George
Bush.''
   ``I've taken heat before and I'll stay in the kitchen, as they
say,'' Quayle said.
   The Indiana senator spoke with reporters as he left fund-raisers
in Atlanta and a rally at a high school in Woodstock, Ga. He then
traveled to Raleigh, N.C. for a rally.
   Since his debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen, Quayle has shrugged off polls suggesting many voters still
doubt his qualifications and think he lost the confrontation with
the Texas senator.
   At one point Friday, Quayle was asked to justify his post-debate
assertions this week that Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee, ``looks down on America.''
   ``He does look down on America; he's got an idea that America
somehow is not a growth-oriented country,'' Quayle said. ``The
governor himself looks down and takes a very liberal viewpoint
towards America and that is looking down on America.''
   Quayle earlier said he was not concerned about the new Dukakis
ads, one of which notes that Bush had chosen Quayle to replace him
should tragedy occur and says, ``Hopefully we will never know how
great a lapse of judgment that really was.''
   ``I haven't seen them. I've heard about them. They obviously
don't have anything bad to say about George Bush and that's fine
with me,'' Quayle told reporters as he toured a Chattanooga, Tenn.,
technical school.
   When he was asked at the Atlanta appearance to elaborate, Quayle
said, ``I think that is the new role _ that I'm going to take all
the heat and the criticism.''
   ``That is my new assignment and I am willing to take it on very
energetically,'' Quayle said.
   Later, Quayle told reporters on his campaign plane that it was
his decision to take on the role of ``lightning rod.''
   ``I assigned the role to myself. ... I'm going to be taking all
the heat and that's just fine. We'll let George Bush have a free
ride,'' he said.
   Quayle asserted that Dukakis was pulling much of his
organization out of the South because ``they've lost the South.''
Dukakis campaign officials have denied any such pullout.
   At Etowah High School in Woodstock, Quayle was greeted by
students waving small U.S. flags and cheering. The school presented
him with a ceramic quail.
   He took questions from the students, who wanted to know how he
would safeguard women's rights, Social Security and care for the
elderly.
   Jan Lee, a Spanish teacher, said Quayle was ``a real charismatic
type of person.'' However, his comments, all from his stump
campaign speeches, didn't satisfy everybody.
   ``He avoided the questions, all of them,'' said Carrie Amerson,
17. Another student, Kelly Helms, 15, also thought he went ``around
the questions.''
   At the tour of the Chattanooga technical school, Quayle helped
demonstrate a computer-controlled robot paint sprayer. The sprayer
doused a blackboard with water and then Quayle aimed it in the
direction of the press corps.
   ``That's for all those articles you've written about me,'' he
said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Officials in a small town clashed
with citizens demanding their ouster and a soldier guarding the
officials shot and killed one of the demonstrators, an independent
radio station reported Friday.
   Some Haitians said Thursday's confrontation in Desdunes, 150
miles north of the capital, was one of several indicating the
military government is clamping down on the reform movement
launched by a Sept. 17 soldiers' rebellion.
   In unrelated fighting about 50 miles south of Desdunes, two
people were killed Friday in a feud between members of two families
over land and hundreds of people fled their homes fearing a
massacre, according to Radio Haiti-Inter.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said the fight in Desdunes began after groups
representing youths, peasants and planters met to formulate demands
for disarming members of the Tonton Macoutes and repressive
government officials.
   The Tonton Macoutes were the private militia that supported the
29-year dictatorship of the Duvalier family.
   The demonstrators took to the streets intending to shut down
government offices, the broadcast said. Before they got to the
courthouse they were blocked by ``The Steamroller,'' a group of
henchmen and city officials led by Mayor Anthenor Mercius, the
radio said.
   The mayor's group, guarded by soldiers, threw rocks at the
protesters, and four soldiers protecting the demonstrators withdrew
to their barracks, the broadcast said.
   It said a soldier in the mayor's group, Sgt. Detroit Valco,
killed a youth identified as Evarol Racine and wounded another man
in the foot. Four other demonstrators were injured by rocks, the
radio said.
   Paul Latortue, an economist who ran for the region's Senate seat
in November's violently aborted national elections, said the town
is a stronghold of the Tonton Macoutes.
   Latortue noted that on Sunday, the government said it was
temporarily suspending the search for Tonton Macoutes. On
Wednesday, soldiers killed a squatter in the capital, and on
Thursday they dispersed a demonstration in the town of
Port-de-Paix, he said.
   The government believes ``the social potential of the soldiers'
reform movement is too high, it must be reduced and checked,''
Latortue said.
   The enlisted men of the Presidential Guard overthrew the
military government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a bloodless coup on
Sept. 17 and named Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to replace him.
   The soldiers demanded an improvement in living conditions for
themselves, the ouster of unpopular military and government
officials, and a return to the 1987 Constitution, which Namphy
suspended.
   In the initial reaction to the coup, people across the country
chased down, killed and burned several Tonton Macoutes.
   Latortue said Avril has consolidated his power and promoted
non-commissioned officers to bring them into line.
   ``Avril is successfully bringing off a vast seduction campaign
on behalf of American aid,'' Latortue said. ``But the fist in the
velvet glove is iron.''
   Radio-Metropole reported Friday that Haitian employees of the
U.S. Agency for International Development petitioned for immediate
resumption of U.S. assistance to Haiti.
   Two-thirds of the $90 million U.S. aid package was cut off last
year when November's elections were canceled. Thugs supported by
the army attacked and killed 34 people at the polls.
   Namphy took over after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
exile in France in February 1986. Duvalier ruled after the 1971
death of his father, Francois Duvalier, who took over in 1957.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said its reporter in Estere, 100 miles north
of Port-au-Prince, said one person was was shot to death, another
was killed by machete blows and ``many people'' were clubbed or
stoned in fighting Friday in the fertile Artibonite Valley.
   It said the feud involves members of the Hatier and Bercourt
families who have had violent disputes for years over land
ownership.
   The report said that after a fatal shooting, Hatier property
near Estere was invaded by members of the Desdunes-based Bercourt
and in the fighting, hundreds of residents fled the area in panic.
   It said police made one arrest and called for reinforcements to
help restore calm.
   In July 1987, more than 250 people were killed near the town of
Jean Rabel in Artibonite province in battles involving a dispute
between an association of landless peasants and a coalition of
landowners and sharecroppers.

   Anti-abortion demonstrators besieging women's
clinics here called in reinforcements to continue their week of
protests, saying Friday's 53 arrests had nearly exhausted their
pool of people willing to go to jail.
   More than 400 people have been arrested since Tuesday for trying
to block clinics as part of a campaign by Operation Rescue, the
group that organized protests during the Democratic National
Convention in July.
   About 500 people attended Operation Rescue's nightly rally
Friday night at a suburban Atlanta church. Rally leaders said that
in addition to the usual activity at abortion clinics, a
demonstration would be held Saturday outside the city jail where
the arrested protesters are being held.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Nolte predicted Saturday could be
the biggest day of the ``Siege of Atlanta.''
   Those arrested Friday had blocked two driveway entrances to the
Midtown Clinic. Police appeared to treat them more gently than
those arrested earlier this week.
   On previous days, police roughly dragged demonstrators who
refused to walk to waiting vans and buses bound for jail. They also
dragged those arrested Friday, but more carefully, with only the
demonstrators' feet touching the ground.
   ``I believe the public would rather see us take more time and be
more gentle,'' said Maj. Kenneth Burnette.
   During the arrests of one group, Burnette asked demonstrators
leaning against a clinic gate in the early morning chill if they
would walk to the buses ``like gentlemen and ladies.'' Few did.
   The picketing followed what demonstrators called an ``end run''
by clinic operators the day before, in which patients were whisked
inside before demonstrators arrived.
   Midtown administrator Ignatius deBlasi said about 80 percent of
the patients with appointments Friday showed up; the clinic usually
handles 25-30 women daily.
   As one woman was escorted through protesters trying to block the
back gate, they said to her, ``Have mercy on your son or daughter.''
   After the arrests, small groups held hands during Bible readings
or sang hymns on the sidewalk outside the clinic.
   Pro-choice advocates, who say the decision on abortion should be
the mother's, not the state's, have escorted patients to clinics
but decided against counterdemonstrations to avoid making the
situation more difficult, they said.
   Some pro-choice supporters were on hand at Midtown, one carrying
a sign denouncing ``coat-hanger therapy,'' a reference to
often-fatal ``back-alley'' abortions that they say women would be
forced into if abortion were outlawed.
   ``It's like this rail here,'' said an abortion opponent to a
pro-choice advocate. ``You are on one side or the other.''
   As of Friday afternoon, 38 of the 421 people arrested this week
had been released on bail, usually set at $650.
   Operation Rescue officials complained that their sympathizers
were being denied release on bail.
   ``There's no truth to it at all,'' said Sgt. Willie Cotton at
the jail where many of the protesters are being held. ``They may
have requested bond, but they haven't finished the processing.''

<HEAD>`Old Black Magic' Singer Dies At 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big band singer Billy Daniels, who hit the
big time with the 1946 song ``Old Black Magic'' from the movie
``Star Spangled Rhythm,'' died Friday of stomach cancer. He was 73.
   Daniels, who had been diagnosed with cancer in August, died at
the Norris Cancer Hospital and Research Institute at the University
of Southern California.
   Born the son of a railroad mail clerk, Daniels started in show
business as a Depression-era singing waiter in a New York City
speak-easy.
   He first sang ``Old Black Magic'' at the Harlem Club in Atlantic
City as a last-minute addition to his act, pulling the tune out of
stack of sheet music just before he went on stage.
   For more than 40 years, the song remained a staple of his shows,
including his performances in July at the Del Webb's Claridge
Casino Hotel in Atlantic City.
   Daniels went back to singing this summer after quadruple heart
bypass surgery last year.
   ``He was a superstar to me and he was a superstar to millions of
others,'' said Perry Daniels, his wife of 33 years.
   Daniels also won the London Critics Award in 1978 for best
musical performance in ``Bubblin' Brown Sugar.''
   A funeral service was set for Tuesday at Church of the Good
Shepherd in Beverly Hills.

   A fire at a rural gun factory Friday killed
four people, destroyed the building and forced firefighters to
retreat as bullets whizzed by them, authorities said.
   The bodies of four people were recovered from the rubble of the
Buffalo Rock Shooters Supply, which makes ammunition and machine
guns for police departments around the country, authorities said.
   ``It was a big ball of fire with a couple of explosions. There
were a lot of bullets flying,'' said Vince Dettore, fire chief of
Naplate, a town about four miles east of the factory.
   Dettore said workers were believed to have been making bullets
when the first explosion hit about 11:30 a.m. in the main building,
which also housed the company's general offices and gun shop.
   The official cause was unknown, but fire investigators suspect a
spark may have ignited gunpowder used to make bullets, he said.
Ottawa is about 70 miles southwest of Chicago.
   ``It started in the main bulding where they make ammunition and
sell guns,'' Dettore said. ``A place like that with all that black
powder _ just the dust, if you get a spark in there that's all it's
going to take. They had cases and cases and cases of all kinds of
ammunition, all kinds of guns.''
   The victims had not been positively identified Friday night and
La Salle County Coroner Marion Osborne said through a spokesman
that the process wouldn't be finished until Saturday.
   Jody Bernard, the coroner's secretary, said a forensic dentist
was summoned to help identify the bodies.
   When firefighters arrived at the company's complex, they began
battling the blaze as bullets whizzed through the air, Dettore said.
   ``It's not as dangerous as if it was shot out of a gun itself,''
the fire chief said. ``It gets a little scary when you get a big
explosion.''
   But Dettore said that when he found out the buildings contained
substantial amounts of gunpowder, he ordered the 40 firefighters to
retreat about a half mile.
   They stayed away for about 45 minutes and resumed fighting the
fire about 1 p.m., Dettore said. They had most of the fire put out
in about an hour, though small fires still flared.
   More than 120 firefighters battled the blaze.

   The number of AIDS cases registered by the World
Health Organization increased 7 percent to 120,000 during September
with Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya accounting for much of the rise, a
WHO report said Friday.
   The actual total is estimated by the WHO to be double the
officially reported number. Jonathan Mann, head of the Global
Program on AIDS, estimates up to 10 million people may be infected
with the deadly virus that causes AIDS. Mann expects at least 1
million new cases of the disease by 1993.
   Malawi had a 400 percent rise in cases since its last report of
Oct. 31, with 2,586 cases reported. Tanzania reported 3,055 cases,
or almost twice the total it gave lact Oct. 17.
   The aggregate AIDS total for the 45 African countries rose from
14,818 to 19,034, with Kenya's 2,732 cases up more than 33 percent
since March 31.
   Among other countries also reporting an increase in victims was
the United States, up 3 percent to 73,394; Brazil, up 24 percent to
3,687; and Mexico, up 16 percent to 1,502.

<HEAD>Electric Boat Strike Negotiations End Without Contract Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days of marathon contract negotiations
ended Friday night without a resolution to the 3-month-old strike
at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Conn., a manufacturer of
Navy nuclear submarines.
   Labor and company negotiators met with federal mediators in
Washington for about 30 hours since Wednesday, but could not reach
an accord to end the wage dispute. Friday was day 99 of the strike.
   Officials at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service said
they would be in contact with both parties, but no further
negotiating sessions were set.
   Representatives from the sub-building division of General
Dynamics Corp. said they reoffered their previous proposal, a
four-year contract with bonuses and a one-time 3 percent wage
increase.
   The Metal Trades Council, an umbrella group representing all the
striking unions, had said it wanted a three-year contract with 4
percent raises in at least the second and third years.
   In a prepared statement, the company said, ``It appears that
this unnecessary and illegal strike will continue indefinitely as
will the hiring of permanent replacements.''
   The bargaining sessions with the mediation service were the
first major negotiations since another round of federally mediated
talks broke off in August without an agreement.
   Hopes were high that the strike would be settled this week as
pressure mounted on the union.
   More than 1,500 of the original 10,000 striking workers have
crossed picket lines and returned to work.
   And a key union, the Boilermakers International, told the Metal
Trades Council that it wanted the strike settled immediately,
fearing the job action may be declared illegal. Electric Boat could
fire striking workers if the strike is found to be illegal.
   A National Labor Relations Board official has questioned the
strike's legality because it did not receive a strike notification
30 days in advance from the Metal Trades Council as required by
law. The union sent the notification to the wrong address.
   MTC officials have said they believe the strike is legal because
they notified federal officials orally of the strike plan.
   Electric Boat is the Navy's sole producer of the giant Trident
nuclear submarines and competes annually with the Newport News
(Va.) Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. for contracts to build the
smaller, SSN-688 fast attack subs.
   The company said it needs to hold down labor costs to remain
competitive for Navy submarine contracts.
   Electric Boat, one of New England's largest employers, normally
has 18,000 workers at the Groton plant and another 6,000 at its
North Kingstown, R.I., facility. The Rhode Island workers did not
strike.

   Florida's Supreme Court, for only the
second time in its history, publicly reprimanded a judge Friday,
rebuking him for 14 judicial indiscretions that included waving a
gun from the bench.
   Circuit Judge Wallace E. Sturgis Jr. of Marion County was
summoned before the court and accused by Chief Justice Raymond
Ehrlich of sullying his reputation and his family name.
   ``This is probably one of the most distateful chores that I have
had to perform,'' Ehrlich told Sturgis and a courtroom audience of
about 50 people.
   The Judicial Qualifications Commission found Sturgis guilty of
the 14 counts of misconduct.
   The commission said that besides waving a handgun twice in
hearings, Sturgis failed for 19 years to keep adequate records of a
$20,000 estate he managed for a blind and incompetent family friend.
   It said he should have transferred the account when he became a
judge in 1973.
   Sturgis, whose father, Wallace Edwin Sturgis, was Senate
president in 1951-53 and an appeals judge, listened with downcast
eyes to the reprimand.
   ``For more than 15 years you in the exercise of your judicial
duties have stood in judgment of others. Today, you are the one
being judged,'' said Ehrlich, adding that it was a ``lack of
corrupt motives and the absence of moral turpitude'' that kept the
commission from recommending Sturgis' removal.
   Sturgis said nothing to the court and left without comment.
   In earlier hearings, an attorney for Sturgis said he pulled the
gun because of a ``startle reflex.'' He said the judge had been the
victim of an attack and was nervous about courthouse security.
   The last judge ordered to appear before the court for reprimand
was Circuit Judge Jack Block of Miami, who was rebuked two years
ago for violating legal ethics before he joined the bench, said Sid
White, clerk of the court.
   Usually, the court issues reprimands in writing.

   A New Jersey couple, caught in the 1985
terrorist hijacking of the Mediteranean cruise ship Achille Lauro,
sued the Palestine Liberation Organization on Friday for more than
$11 million.
   The lawsuit, filed at U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accused
the PLO of false imprisonment, assault and battery and
intentionally inflicting emotional distress on Frank R. Hodes and
his wife, Mildred, both of Springfield, N.J.
   The Achille Lauro, a 24,000-ton Italian liner, was seized Oct.
7, 1983, off Egypt by terrorists identifying themselves as members
of a PLO splinter group, the Palestine Liberation Front.
   The terrorists demanded the release of 50 Palestinians held in
Israel.
   One wheelchair-bound American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, 69,
of New York, was killed by the terrorists before they left the
vessel Oct. 9.
   The lawsuit described the Hodeses as ``long-standing friends''
of Klinghoffer and his wife, Marilyn.
   After the hijackers left the ship, the lawsuit said, Mrs. Hodes
learned ``from the captain that she was to be the next victim,'' if
the ordeal had continued.
   According to the lawsuit, the acts of terrorism on the Achille
Lauro were directed by the PLO ``to terrorize American citizens,
especially those such as the Hodeses of Jewish faith.''
   According to the lawsuit, Hodes was off the vessel with 600
other passengers for a one-day excursion to see the Egyptian
pyramids when the terrorists seized the ship, and the remaining
passengers _ including his wife and 11 other Americans.

   A prisoner carrying the AIDS virus received
a 15-year prison sentence Friday for biting a guard who later
tested negative for the deadly disease.
   Circuit Judge Henry W. Blizzard also sentenced Adam Brock to 10
years for assaulting guards with a padlock.
   The additional sentences were added to Brock's 13-year sentence
for robbery. He had served all but two years of the robbery
sentence.
   Limestone County District Attorney Jimmy Fry said he will pursue
attempted murder charges against any other AIDS inmate who attacks
a guard by biting. He said Brock ``used his mouth as a deadly

   Inmates with acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been

   Opposition leaders said Friday that they
want President Augusto Pinochet out of office before 1990, despite
his vow to complete his term after losing a referendum. Hundreds of
thousands celebrated the ``no'' vote.
   Ten people were wounded, two seriously, when soldiers fired on
celebrants in passing cars, a radio station reported.
   Six journalists in Chile to cover the referendum also were
slightly injured when they were caught between riot police and
demonstrators Friday night near the national palace. Four of the
injured required treatment at Santa Maria Clinic for head wounds.
   Ricardo Lagos, a moderate Socialist prominent in the 16-party
opposition alliance, said the president, who is also army
commander, has ``too great an ambition for power'' and should heed
the message this week by voters ``who said `No more.' ''
   Hundreds of thousands of Chileans swayed and sang along with
some of the country's most popular music groups in a park Friday in
an opposition celebration. No politicians spoke and the music was
pointedly non-political, but people chanted on their own: ``Chi Chi
Chi, Le Le Le, Get Out Pinochet!'' and ``He's Going to Fall!''
   People bound for the park in buses and packed automobiles
chanted anti-government slogans and waved anti-Pinochet banners.
Police estimated the crowd at up to 350,000.
   A free presidential election is to be held late next year
because of Pinochet's loss in the yes-or-no referendum Wednesday on
whether he should remain in office until 1997. He can run in that
election if he chooses.
   The winner takes office in March 1990 and Pinochet said Thursday
night he will not permit changes in the election schedule and he
vowed not to leave office early. Pinochet took power in a September
1973 coup that ousted Marxist President Salvador Allende.
   While there was a peaceful gathering in the capital's biggest
park on a warm hazy afternoon, there was violence elsewhere later.
   Radio Cooperativa, an independent news station, reported
soldiers outside an army barracks near the park fired buckshot and
pellets at people in passing cars who flashed the V sign for
victory.
   It said two people were seriously wounded and eight were treated
at Santiago Central Emergency Hospital. A hospital spokesman told
The Associated Press nine people were treated for gunshot wounds
and a 10th was taken to a neurological hospital.
   Several hundred youths leaving the rally behind the national
palace tried to stage a demonstration. Police, anticipating
trouble, blocked the street off to traffic, then scattered the
youths with water cannon and tear gas.
   The demonstrators regrouped, however. During the charge, riot
police kicked and lashed with nightsticks at newsmen.
   ``We were crouched behind a fruit stand _ not in the way and
trying to get out of the way,'' Associated Press photographer John
Hopper said. ``It happened so quick, nobody flashed (photographed)
them. We did nothing to draw attention to us.''
   Opposition leaders have requested talks with the government on
amending the constitution and speeding Pinochet's departure. Lagos
said the administration might become more flexible later.
   ``You have to give the defeated a couple of days to recover from
the shock,'' he said. ``Let's talk more seriously about it next
week.''
   He said the opposition should unify in its bid for an earlier
election, declaring: ``If we join together with more force, I think
the situation will change.''
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez said the government would
negotiate with the opposition only ``if it was necessary.''
   Alfonso Marquez de la Plata, the labor minister, said: ``These
people participated in the referendum and have to abide by the
rules of the game.''
   Lagos spoke to reporters outside a federal prison where he
visited a more radical Socialist, Clodomiro Aylmeda, who is serving
a 541-day term on charges of promoting political violence through
public anti-government statements.
   Whether Pinochet can resist opposition pressure is expected to
depend on support from his army, and no splits in the ranks were
evident Friday.
   Gen. Eduardo Ibanez, governor of the southern Eighth Region, was
quoted Friday by La Epoca, a moderate Santiago daily, as saying:
``We have lost a battle, but not the war. This is an electoral
defeat for the governent, but from the military point of view it's
no more than a battle.''
   He accused voters of ``ingratitude,'' the report said.
   The navy, air force and national police are generally seen as
more willing to negotiate with the opposition but lack the army's
size and political clout.
   Pinochet's 1980 constitution gives the military autonomy and an
influential role in national policy under a democratic government.

<TEXT>
   Actress Robin Givens filed for divorce Friday
from heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson after a turbulent
eight-month marriage she called ``a continuous horror story'' of
destruction, drinking and domestic violence.
   In filing for the divorce, the actress also won a court order to
keep him away from her and the Burbank Studios set where her ABC
series, ``Head of the Class'' is taped.
   The divorce petition filed in Superior Court cited
irreconcilable differences as Miss Givens' reason to end the
marriage to Tyson, 22, whose wealth is estimated at $40 million.
   In an attached declaration, Miss Givens, 23, recounts an alleged
attack last Sunday in the couple's mansion in Bernardsville, N.J.
   ``I was awakened by Michael's hitting about my body and my head
with his closed fist and open hand.
   ``Michael appeared, by his actions and by his breath, to be
intoxicated and I discovered that he had been drinking champagne
early in the morning,'' the declaration continued. ``I was
frightened for my life and terrorized.''
   Tyson retained high-powered local attorney Howard Weitzman for
the divorce battle. Weitzman successfully defended automaker John
DeLorean against cocaine trafficking charges.
   ``I think Michael is disappointed, given the circumstances, that
the relationship has resolved itself in the manner it has. In a
sense he is relieved that he could put his life back in order and
could go on with his life,'' Weitzman said.
   He declined comment on the divorce action until he and Tyson see
it.
   ``I think there has been a lot of press about Mike and his
relationship with Robin. I think Mike would just like to go back to
being the champion of the world,'' Weitzman said.
   Miss Givens, who is in town working on the TV series, didn't
appear at a courthouse news conference at which Marvin Michelson,
the celebrity divorce lawyer, announced the divorce action.
   Mitchelson, who filed the petition for Miss Givens, said
Superior Court Judge Hugh E. MacBeth Jr. issued a restraining order
barring the fighter from approaching the actress.
   Other orders require him to move from Miss Givens' Hollywood
Hills home without removing any possessions, and to to stay at
least 1,000 feet from the actress, her home and her work place.
   Mitchelson said he wasn't ready to say how much of Tyson's
fortune the actress would seek. California's community property law
entitles a spouse to 50 percent of a couple's earnings during their
marriage.
   Referring to the alleged attack Sunday, Miss Givens said in her
declaration: ``The above described incident was the latest in a
continuous horror story for me. Michael has repeatedly hit me,
threw things at me, threatened to kill me'' and also threatened to
kill her mother, her sister, Stephanie Givens, and an employee.
   Mitchelson said Miss Givens still cared about her husband,
despite the alleged violence, which the actress has previously
described in a televised interview.
   ``She loves Mike Tyson. She tried to protect Mike Tyson and
nurture him. She wishes him every good thing in life,'' Mitchelson
said. ``(But) there's continued violence and she fears for her
safety.''
   Mitchelson has also represented actress Joan Collins and was the
lawyer in a landmark ``palimony'' decision against the late actor
Lee Marvin.
   In an interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20-20'' a week
ago, Miss Givens said her husband has an ``extremely volatile
temper'' and that life with him was ``torture ... pure hell.'' She
said she's become very afraid of him, but gave no indication she
wanted to end the marriage.
   Tyson, the youngest heavyweight champion ever, told Miss Walters
that he loves his wife and would not stand in her way if she chose
to leave.
   ``My wife would just have to ask for it and she has every penny
I have,'' said Tyson.
   Miss Givens told Miss Walters that Tyson is a manic-depressive,
but a doctor who examined the heavyweight champ said this week he
is not.
   Friends of Tyson have accused Miss Givens and her mother, Ruth
Roper, of manipulating Tyson in order to gain control of his $40
million fortune.
   Days after the interview, police went to the couple's New Jersey
mansion to try to calm Tyson, at the request of Miss Givens and her
mother, because the champ reportedly had flown into a rage and
hurled furniture through the windows.
   It was another incident in a stormy year for Tyson.
   He gave away a $100,000 automobile after a minor accident,
cracked a bone in his hand in a late-night fight on a Harlem street
and was reported to have threatened suicide before slamming his car
into a tree last month in New York.
   A newspaper report also said Tyson had several violent episodes
and chased Miss Givens and her mother in a Moscow hotel when the
actress was there filming an episode of the series last month.
   The couple was married Feb. 7 in Chicago after the National
Basketball Association All-Star game, which Tyson attended. But
because the couple did not have an Illinois license, they were
remarried two days later in New York.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose brother's killer escaped from
Massachusetts' prison furlough program and attacked a couple in
Maryland took her criticism of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
to California on Friday in a trip financed by George Bush
supporters.
   ``I think it's at a point in this country where the prisoners'
rights have superseded and taken over,'' said Donna Fournier Cuomo
of Lawrence, Mass., whose 17-year-old brother, Joey Fournier, was
murdered in 1974 by Willie Horton.
   ``The victims are not heard,'' she added, saying, ``Gov.
Dukakis, I don't feel, would address this issue.''
   Mrs. Cuomo endorsed Republican Vice President Bush for the
presidency, but the Maryland man who was attacked by Horton after
his escape, refused to endorse anyone at the news conference.
   ``This isn't political to my wife and I,'' said Cliff Barnes, a
former resident of Oxon Hill, Md., explaining his non-partisan
position.
   Both Barnes and Mrs. Cuomo said their expenses for their trip to
Los Angeles and Sacramento on Friday and to Texas next week were
being paid by the Committee for the Presidency, a group formed to
support Bush's candidacy.
   But Barnes said he wanted to address only the Massachusetts'
furlough program, saying, ``It's not a successful program.''
   Horton had been serving a life sentence without parole in
Massachusetts for Fournier's murder when he walked away from his
10th release on weekend furlough.
   He broke into the Barnes' home in April 1987. Cliff Barnes was
slashed 22 times and then tied up by Horton. His then-fiancee and
now wife, Angi, was beaten and raped twice.
   The Democrats' response to Republican attacks on the program
have consisted of ``a bunch of misleading statistics that hide the
faces and the lives of the real victims,'' said Barnes.
   ``I will never understand it,'' Mrs. Cuomo said of a program
allowing the weekend furlough of a first-degree murderer. ``To me,
it does not make sense.''
   Barnes and Mrs. Cuomo also said that as governor, Dukakis has
refused to meet with them about crimes committed by Massachusetts
convicts while on weekend furloughs or work-release programs.
   They also asserted that Dukakis resisted efforts to prohibit
first-degree murderers from participating in the state furlough
program.
   In April, Dukakis signed legislation to enact just such a change
in the Massachusetts program.
   When Bush began pressing the furlough issue, the Dukakis
campaign fired back with statistics showing that the furlough
escape rate in Massachusetts has been below the national average.
   Dukakis officials also contend that more than 40 states have
furlough programs for convicted felons, and at least 23 states make
first-degree murderers eligible for furloughs.
   The Democrats also invoked the record of Ronald Reagan, who
supported the furlough program in California _ even after two
convicts killed people while on furlough in late 1971 and early
1972.
   At the time of the murders in California, former Los Angeles
Police Chief Ed Davis, now a Republican state senator, complained
to then-Gov. Reagan that ``about 40 percent of our serious and
violent offenders are on active parole from your Department of
Corrections.''
   Both Reagan and Dukakis inherited their respective state
furlough programs, and both defended the programs from political
attacks that arose following crimes committed by convicts on
furlough.

   Samuel K. Royal, 19, pleaded guilty Wednesday to theft charges,

   He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and $5,000 fine, but
prosecutors recommended a 5-year deferred sentence, 30 days in
jail, 100 hours of public service, and rehabilitation classes.
   Royal was arrested in April when police found the handwritten
page of mathematical notes in his bedroom closet. The manuscript
had been missing about six days from a locked case in the
university's Flawn Academic Center, police said.
   Darrell Royal, his grandfather, was UT football coach from 1957

<HEAD>Cypriot President Calls For Demilitarization Of Island Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus on
Thursday called for demilitarization of his Mediterranean island
nation, where a U.N. peacekeeping force separates the hostile
Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities.
   ``We propose to dismantle the military forces of the Republic
(of Cyprus) if all Turkish troops and settlers withdraw and if the
armed elements they have fostered are disbanded,'' Vassiliou told
delegates to the 43rd General Assembly.
   In 1974, Greece's military junta sponsored a coup on Cyprus that
failed. Turkey invaded to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, and
still occupies about 40 percent of the northern part of Cyprus.
   The northern part of Cyprus declared itself to be the ``Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus'' in 1975, a breakaway state recognized
only by Turkey. About 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled the northern
section during the invasion and tens of thousands of Turks have
since come to Cyprus to settle there.
   ``We undertake to use the funds which will be saved through
demilitarization for the development of areas of Cyprus which have
fallen behind economically and primarily for projects which will
benefit mainly the Turkish Cypriots,'' Vassiliou proposed.
   ``Part of the savings could also be used for financing the
international peace force to be established,'' he added. The
current 2,300-member U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus is funded by
voluntary contributions of U.N. members.
   Vassiliou first suggested this plan in June at the General
Assembly's Special Session on Disarmament.
   He said the solution of the Cyprus problem is defined in U.N.
resolutions that call for all foreign troops and settlers to leave
the island; that call for respect for human rights; and that say no
other nation has a right to intervene in Cypriot internal affairs.
   ``We believe that in the future federal Republic of Cyprus that
we envision all Cypriots, whether Greek or Turkish, should enjoy
equality of opportunity and fundamental freedoms including the
right to develop their distinctive cultural heritages,'' he said.
   Vassiliou has met with Rauf Denktash, president of the breakaway
Turkish republic on northen Cyprus, to discuss reunification of the
island. The talks were held at the invitation of Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``The target is to achieve a just and lasting solution of the
Cyprus problem by June 1989,'' Vassiliou said.
   In his speech to the General Asssembly, Vassiliou also called
for worldwide military cutbacks, with the major lending nations
using the savings to establish national funds to buy at the present
discounted market rates the outstanding loans owed to their
commercial banks by developing nations.
   ``The cost of these national debt relief programs would be
minimal if they are coupled with an imaginative use of tax
credits,'' he said.

<HEAD>Official Admits Errors But Still Backs Dam Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environment minister said Thursday
that government failure to consult the public about a planned dam
project generated opposition to the project, but he still backed
construction of the dam.
   ``We can now see clearly that the absence of openness ... has
done a lot of damage,'' Laszlo Marothy said in Parliament of a
government report on the dam and hydroelectric power plant
communist Hungary and Czechoslovakia are building on the Danube.
   ``Leaving out of consideration indications of public opinion has
produced mistrust and in fact raised antipathy.''
   Dozens of parliamentarians have asked to speak on the report and
several are likely to vote against it. However, government
officials and parliamentarians say it will probably be adopted
Friday.
   The joint Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project has met considerable
opposition in Hungary and dozens of independent environmental and
other interest groups have publicly called for a halt in
construction.
   The groups claim it will cause irreparable ecological damage to
wetland and wildlife along the Danube and pollute large drinking
water reserves.
   Marothy, however, told Parliament the barrage system ``must be
built in keeping with the original concept.''
   ``The government must take responsibility for society as a
whole, even if the price of this is that it must act against the
opinions of some groups,'' Marothy said.
   Marothy argued the issue has become largely symbolic in Hungary
for other social problems.
   ``What has become superimposed on these disputes is the sum of
tensions, social problems and contradictions emerging, ...
including claims for remedying grievances that have nothing to do
with the dam,'' he said.
   On Sept. 12, about 20,000 people gathered in front of Parliament
to protest the project, calling for democracy, a multiparty system
and a referendum.
   Marothy rejected the conclusions of an ad hoc committee of the
Academy of Sciences which presented its findings to the government
Oct. 1, charging they were ``inaccurate.''
   The Academy report, as quoted by Marothy, said stopping or
delaying construction posed a ``realistic alternative'' and
postponing work could reduce economic burdens and entail fewer
environmental risks.
   He said a total cost to Hungary of finishing the project would
amount to about $700 million. Net revenue from the project by the
year 2015 would amount to the same, Marothy said.
   Austria is financing part of the Hungarian side of the project
in return for electric power.
   In another development, Hungary's foreign minister said at the
United Nations on Thursday that Romania, its Warsaw Pact ally, is
guilty of human rights violations, but said Moscow was not taking
sides in the Hungarian-Romanian dispute.
   The conflict revolves around Romania's ethnic Hungarian
minority, which Hungary says is being systematically mistreated in
a resettlement program.
   Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi avoided naming Romania in a
speech Tuesday to the General Assembly, limiting himself to
decrying ``cultural oppression'' of minorities in ``neighboring
countries.''
   But in an interview Thursday, he said: ``It is clear that our
problem in this regard is with Romania.''

   The nation's top business leaders today
offered an optimistic view of economic prospects, predicting growth
will slow enough next year to avoid a severe acceleration of
inflation.
   The Business Council, composed of 62 chief executives of the
country's largest corporations, predicted that the economy, as
measured by the gross national product, will grow 4 percent in
1988, the best in four years.
   ``We are living in a continued strong economy,'' said John S.
Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank. ``We are
very close to full employment, and the inflation numbers ... are
generally felt to be in pretty good shape.''
   The new GNP prediction, reflecting the consensus of the chief
economists of about 20 member corporations, is 1.6 percentage
points better than the prediction last May when the executives last
gathered for their semiannual retreat at this resort town in the
mountains of western Virginia.

   Elevating the Veterans Administration to full
Cabinet status will involve only changing a few signs outside the
building, proponents said after the House voted overwhelming
support of the change.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., said the cost of the change
approved Thursday by the House will come to less than $1 million in
1989 and will give the nation's 27 million veterans direct access
to the White House. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that converting the VA into a Cabinet department would cost $33
million over five years.
   The House vote sent the compromise bill, making the VA the
government's 14th Cabinet department, to the Senate, which was
expected to add its approval. President Reagan backs the move, and
it was his public announcement of support last summer that gave
impetus to the legislation.

   A new recipe has been developed for fortifying
mother's milk to help premature babies ``barely bigger than a man's
hand'' survive and grow normally, the Agriculture Department said.
   ``The immune properties found in mother's milk are so much more
important to preterm infants because they are subject to many more
nfections than full-term infants,'' said Dr. Richard J. Schanler,
physician in charge of the project at the Children's Nutrition
Research Center at Houston.
   But extremely premature babies, some of them weighing less than
two pounds at birth, require more concentrated nutrients than
mother's milk provides, he said. Most currently get a preemie
formula based on cow's milk until they reach about three pounds and
are growing well. After that, some may be switched to mother's milk
mixed with a commercial fortifier.

   AIDS is not sweeping through the heterosexual

   The number of reported heterosexual AIDS cases is doubling every
14 to 16 months, according to the report in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. ``Although AIDS is not `exploding'
into the heterosexual population relative to other risk groups, the
increase in the number of heterosexual cases is proportional to
increases in other risk groups,'' the report said.
   But ``heterosexual spread of AIDS is going to be a bigger
problem than many people in this country up until now have

   ``The Mind,'' an ambitious and emotionally
charged PBS series starting Wednesday, is in many ways the ultimate
``behind-the-scenes'' television program.
   Aided by computers and X-ray scanners, the nine-part series goes
inside the brain to see the formation of thoughts and feelings that
surge behind human acts, whether mundane or deeply disturbing.
   The shows popularize theories that have emerged in the brain and
mind sciences in two decades when the cost of direct treatment of
severe mental illness is estimated to have reached $25 billion a
year.
   The most eloquent moments come in vivid interviews with people
who try to explain, sometimes in tears, anger, or bewilderment,
what was happening in their mind when mental disease devasted their
lives and families.
   These case studies go a long way toward helping the series
achieve one of its goals: to erase the stigma of mental illness.
   Lurking in the back of ``The Mind'' are controversial questions
which the series implies but does not answer: Should brain and mind
be probed chemically or by computer to find out how people will
act? When and how much should chemicals, cells or genes in humans
be altered to change the functions of the mind? And who should make
those decisions?
   But the shows, six years in the making at the cost of $8
million, do not shirk controversy.
   ``The series starts with a controversial statement: The mind is
what the brain does. A lot of people don't necessarily think that.
Even today there are still dualists who think that the mind and the
brain may be separate,'' said Richard Hutton, who created the
series and is executive editor.
   ``In our `aging' show, I'm very optimistic about the newest work
that indicates that aging is less of a deterioration than was
thought. I think there is controversy also in our `addiction' show
which really debunks the notion `Just say no;' and in our `pain and
healing' show which I think is a responsible report on where we
stand in looking at how the mind heals the body,'' Hutton said in
an interview.
   Other one-hour segments examine consciousness, development,
depression, language, and thought; 90 minutes is devoted to the
violent mind. Each has interviews with about a dozen specialists
mostly from medical schools in the United States and abroad. The
program follows the 1984 series ``The Brain'' and has an advisory
board of 10 experts.
   One of the more dramatic ``behind-the-scenes'' techniques
displays how groups of brain cells are activated while a volunteer
with a mild radioactive injection is strapped in a scanner and
speaks or reads. Such experiments help researchers understand
language development and offer hope for the treatment of complex
mental diseases.
   The shows use computer-generated visual effects to detail
mechanisms behind the spark of an idea or the shift of a mood.
PacMan-like graphics which trace chemical paths that transmit pain
or pleasure also illustrate theories on how the mind can be
derailed by drugs, chemicals in the workplace, stress or illness.
   The series also asks why one person becomes a genius musician,
another a psychopathic murderer. Are states of mind influenced more
by environment, biochemicals or genes? Is the brain ``hard-wired''
to sway moods or patterns of thought?
   Narrator George Page, exuding rational optimism, points to some
answers that hint at possible profound changes in the treatment of
mental disease and the handling of criminals. Some changes, he
cautions, may be decades away.
   While ``The Mind'' is encyclopedic, it has shortcomings. Chief
among these is its avoidance of some darker implications of
research: mind control, brainwashing or mass media manipulation.
And although one show has an interview with a survivor of a Soviet
prison camp, the series does not examine abuses of psychiatric
treatment on political dissidents.
   ``We didn't go into brainwashing. It's something I'm kind of
interested in, and it didn't happen,'' Hutton said. ``We thought
about it a lot. We decided for a lot of reasons not to do it, but
we certainly considered that notion.''
   The TV version also suffers from some historical
absent-mindedness.
   There's a brief clip of Hitler and cheering masses, but the only
identification of one of history's most brutal madmen is in a
caption in the companion book by Richard M. Restak.
   Hiroshima comes up in radiation studies on fetal brain cells.
But the only explanation that it was the U.S. bombing that hastened
the end of World War II is in the series' educational supplement
produced with funding from Control Data Corp. and distributed to
7,000 high schools.

   Producer Nicolas Noxon acknowledges that
telling the story of 100 years of the National Geographic Society
presented a few sticky problems.
   First of all, how do you get a century of exploration around the
world, and in recent years out of this world, into a 90-minute
documentary?
   ``We adopted a pretty pragmatic attitude,'' said Noxon, whose
production of ``The Explorers: A Century of Discovery'' is his
latest for National Geographic. ``The formula I worked out was that
we would put in film on all the important things from the past 100
years and leave everything else out.
   ``Once I resigned myself to the coffee-table concept, once we
got comfortable with that, it worked out pretty well. If we applied
too rigid a test we'd leave out things we wanted in. We came up
with `The Explorers' for the title. If we strayed too far from that
we weren't true to the theme.''
   Noxon also faced the problem of keeping it from becoming just a
cut-and-paste job.
   ``One of our dilemmas was that after all the musts we didn't
have much time for electives,'' he said. ``Certain things just had
to go in. We wanted to add some new film, but it was very
limiting.''
   New film for the 100th anniversary documentary includes a
sequence on mapping the sky at Mount Palomar and a look at the Nova
Scotia home of Geographic founder Alexander Graham Bell.
   Appropriately, ``The Explorers'' will be telecast on Columbus
Day, Wednesday, on PBS.
   The show is largely told with archival photographs and film,
much of it never before seen on television. Associate editor Terry
Koenig, an Emmy winner for ``Secrets of the Titanic,'' worked
closely with Noxon in putting the film together. Among the
highlights:
   _Conquest of the North Pole by Robert Peary, and Richard Byrd's
flight over the South Pole;
   _Exploration of Alaska's Valley of 10,000 Smokes in 1917, the
first Geographic expedition to be documented in motion pictures;
   _William Beebe's descent a half-mile into the ocean depths in a
bathysphere;
   _Harrowing exploration of the stratosphere in a hydrogen-filled
balloon by Army Air Corps officers in 1934; and
   _A 1931 French motor expedition from Beirut to Peking, including
an attempt to drive across the Himalayas.
   ``I came here in 1960 after doing some educational and
institutional films in Washington,'' Noxon said. ``I went to work
for David Wolper in 1965, when he was doing documentaries. I
fancied myself a documentarian, and Wolper was like a rocket then.
I started doing the Geographic specials with Wolper. The first one
I did was `Voyage of the Brigantine Yankee.' The next one I did was
`Dr. Leakey and the Dawn of Man.'''
   Noxon left Wolper after six years, but then returned to do more
Geographic specials. In later years, he produced the specials for
WQED-TV in Pittsburgh. Noxon recently joined ABC-Kane Productions,
founded by Dennis Kane, former head of television for the National
Geographic Society, in association with ABC.
   He has made documentaries on wildlife, early Hollywood, diving
for Spanish treasure, transatlantic liners and many other subjects.
   ``It's amazing what television's been willing to deal with,'' he
said. ``Those of us in the West have rarely succeeded in placing
news-oriented shows with the networks. We were able to get in with
the wildlife shows. In 1966, I was able to talk about ecology,
which was certainly an unknown word then, in a show about the
grizzly bear. We were able to offer the hard idea that the
grizzlies were disappearing and were worth saving.
   ``I got thrown out of Kenya for a show on the vanishing
elephant. That was another unpopular idea. Elephants eat the same
food as people, and people kill the elephants. What can we do? I
don't think we've answered that yet.
   ``But I think by protecting their monopoly on documentaries the
networks have missed a lot. Dennis' company is the first
semiautonomous documentary production group started by a network in
many years.''

<HEAD>The Best Investment of All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whenever homeowners feel frustrated by tales of
huge profits in the stock market they should remind themselves that
they have the best investment of all.
   Securities prices collapse every now and then, but housing
prices generally hold their own. You store stocks in a safe-deposit
box but you can live in a house. You pay big taxes on securities
gains; on houses, you can defer them.
   The advantages don't end there. You may pay for your house in
easy monthly installments, but payments for stocks are up front.
You can fix up your house and increase the value, but you have
little say in a corporate investment.
   But perhaps the greatest security of a housing investment _
after providing shelter for a family _ is the stability of the
investment. Year in and year out, houses generally appreciate, even
when you think they're not.
   In 1981, the median sale price of existing single-family homes,
measured by the National Association of Realtors, was $66,400. In
1987, the figure was $85,400, and through August of this year it
had risen to $91,300.
   National figures can hide regional discrepancies, of course, but
all four sections of the country participated in the the
housing-price advance.
   From 1981 through August, prices in the Northeast jumped from
$63,700 to $144,800. In spite of a manufacturing recession and
various farm problems, they rose in the Midwest from $54,300 to
$70,500; in the South from $64,400 to $84,300, and in the West,
from $96,200 to $122,000.
   In no year since 1981 has the median price failed to gain in the
Midwest and South. The price did fall in the Northeast from 1981 to
1982, but by only $200. In the West it declined in both 1982 and
1985 _ but quickly recovered.
   Such stability is unknown in most other markets. True, the stock
market may have risen at a sharper rate, but the comparison isn't
entirely valid. You can have 50 percent margin in stocks _ but in
housing you might have 90 percent.
   In effect, a homeowner who puts up 10 percent of a home's price
_ the rest coming from the bank _ participates in any price
increase as if he or she owned 100 percent. It is a degree of
leverage almost unknown in securities.
   Leverage and compounding produce financial miracles. An owner
who makes a $10,000 downpayment on a $100,000 house earns 50
percent if that house rises 5 percent to $105,000 in one year.
   As with the purchase of anything, there may be drawbacks in
owning a house. Generally, housing is less liquid than stocks.
While prices might not collapse, markets become inactive every few
years. Selling means legal expenses too.
   But if you do sell and buy a more expensive dwelling you
generally can defer capital gains taxes. Your entire housing equity
can be protected from any taxes so long as the more recently
acquired house remains your property.
   If you attempt to do that with your stock profits you'll invite
the Internal Revenue Service into your affairs. When you sell
stocks you pay taxes on the profits; even if you reinvest in other
stocks there is no deferment.
   Whenever you have the feeling that your pals are making a
killing in the securities markets, therefore, you should sit back
and count your blessings.
   And dwell on the very real probability that their latest winning
effort in the market didn't even offset their losses.

<HEAD>Mixed Reviews for Market `Circuit Breakers' Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   If all goes as expected, the nation's stock
markets will soon embark on an experiment they hope never gets put
to the test.
   The plan, now awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, calls for ``circuit breakers'' that would halt all
trading for set periods of time if stock prices fall by specified
amounts on any given day.
   For example, the New York Stock Exchange would stop trading for
one hour if the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 250 points.
   After that, if the Dow fell 150 points more in the same session,
trading would be halted for two hours.
   The system, developed by the NYSE and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, would also provide that the prices of stock index futures
traded on the Merc would be effectively frozen for 30 minutes if
they declined by an amount roughly equivalent to 100 Dow points.
   The proposal was made ``contingent on adoption by all domestic
markets.'' NYSE officials have said the plan might hit a snag
because of opposition from the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which operates the over-the-counter market.
   The NASD does indeed regard the plan as ``a bad solution'' to
the issues raised by the market crash last October, Joseph
Hardiman, the organization's president, said in an interview.
   But he indicated his group would go along with whatever the SEC
decides, and said he would be surprised if the commission did not
approve the circuit-breaker plan in some form soon.
   The circuit breakers, along with a series of other measures
proposed by the NYSE and the Merc, are designed to supersede the
``collar'' adopted by the Big Board early this year.
   The collar closed the exchange's main computer trading
facilities to orders from professionals engaged in multiple
transactions known as index arbitrage whenever the Dow rose or fell
50 points in a day.
   Other trading, including ``manual'' index arbitrage, was not
affected by the collar.
   In its brief existence, the collar has drawn mixed reviews. And
the circuit breaker system has attracted divergent comments as well.
   To its proponents, it provides a system for everyone involved in
the trading process to stop and evaluate the situation if a selling
panic hits.
   Also, they say, it helps answer the call from the presidential
commission headed by Nicholas Brady, now secretary of the Treasury,
for a recognition that activity in stocks and stock-index options
and futures be recognized as ``one market.''
   Of course, the hope is that the system will help restore
investor confidence to the extent that the circuit breakers never
actually have to be activated.
   On the other side of the debate, Hardiman says: ``Circuit
breakers are likely to increase market volatility rather than curb
it. The closer a market gets to a circuit breaker level, the more
likely it is to reach it as sellers rush to execute orders under
the wire.''
   A similar contention, that the limit would tend to become a
magnet, was made when the collar was adopted. Experience with the
collar has neither proved nor refuted that point.
   Hardiman also cites academic studies that show markets as most
volatile when a security is opening or reopening after a trading
halt.
   Industry organizations ``should be striving to keep the markets
open,'' he maintains.
   If the circuit breakers as proposed by the Big Board had been in
effect for 50 years, they never would have been activated until
last fall.
   So the statistical chances are not great that the system will be
tested during the one-year ``pilot program'' the exchange is
calling for.
   Presumably, the plan's workability would be demonstrated by a
healthier performance by stock prices and increases in measures of
investor confidence such as price-earnings ratios.
   But some Wall Streeters do not buy that idea. ``The proposed
circuit breakers are no protection at all,'' says Raymond F. DeVoe
Jr., an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   ``Stopping trading for an hour when the Dow industrials are down
250 points means you've done nothing until the market's plunged 12
percent. Thanks a lot.''

<HEAD>Is $3 Million `Chicken Feed'? All's Relative as Lotto Jackpots
Grow</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DWIGHT WOODWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the past few months, the Ohio Lottery has
been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of Cleveland Stadium
reminding fans that a $3 million lottery jackpot isn't ``chicken
feed'' or ``chopped liver.''
   During an era when jackpots around the country are regularly
topping $20 million, the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir
up interest in ``Super Lotto'' prizes that a decade ago would have
made newspaper front pages.
   ``We are looking for an expanded base of players,'' said Anne
Bloomberg, Ohio Lottery spokeswoman. ``We want the players to
understand that $3 million is a lot of money. While the giant
jackpots get a lot of focus, $150,000 (annual earnings for 20 years
in a $3 million prize) is a lot of money.''
   The explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play
around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by
dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars, said Paul
Dworin, publisher of Gaming and Wagering Business magazine in New
York.
   ``Florida awards a $55 million jackpot, and a lot of people are
not going to get excited by lower numbers,'' Dworin said. ``Why
play when it's $10 million if it could be $50 million?''
   Florida's $55 million prize, awarded after a Sept. 3 drawing, is
the nation's largest lottery jackpot to date. Six of the 10 largest
jackpots have been awarded this year, records show.
   Many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to
trigger ``lotto mania,'' described as the point when sales increase
dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize. In
most ``lotto'' contests, participants try to guess a series of
numbers to be drawn, and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct
match.
   In Illinois, the attitude of players has changed since the state
started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a high-payoff lotto game
in 1983, said Kathy Rem, lottery communication director.
   ``After a lottery has been around a number of years, people get
used to it. Our players have gotten more sophisticated,'' Ms. Rem
said.
   Asked when ``lotto mania'' begins, she added, ``If you wanted a
number, I'd say $20 million.''
   New York recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to
attract upscale, casual players, said Russell Gladieux, acting
director of the New York State Lottery.
   ``We've completely restructured our advertising to get the
person who wouldn't play for $4 million but would play for $20
million,'' Gladieux said. ``We've begun featuring well-dressed,
well-educated, real people who share their dream of winning, on
television.''
   New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine operate a tri-state lotto, but
with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot
of $9.6 million, the contest may never generate ``lotto mania,''
said Rick Wisler, games manager for the New Hampshire Sweepstakes
Commission.
   Blaine Lewis Jr., president of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said newspaper coverage illustrates
how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars.
   ``In 1983, with a $1.4 million winner in Connecticut, we got a
front page story in The Hartford Courant,'' said Lewis, who tracks
lotteries in 28 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands and five Canadian provinces. He said the same
lottery story in 1988 probably wouldn't make the front section of
the newspaper.
   ``People and the press are getting jaded, but most people still
realize a million dollars is a lot of money,'' he said.
   Dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for
lotteries to increase the odds of winning.
   ``If you increase the (choice of numbers), the odds are much
longer and therefore even if more people play, there's a higher
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots,'' Dworin
said.
   In Ohio, where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44, the
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been
$32 million. Ms. Bloomberg said there are several points when sales
increase.
   ``Ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some
casual players come in,'' said Ms. Bloomberg. ``At $13 million to
$15 million, about 80 percent come in.''
   She said once the jackpot exceeds $15 billion, just about
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who
can't by law.
   ``When we get the big jackpots, the attention heightens
visibility, which heightens sales, which heightens the jackpot and
it just keeps going,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   During 11 years as vice president to Jomo
Kenyatta, Daniel arap Moi says, his job was to ``sing the tune'' of
Kenya's first president.
   A decade after Kenyatta's death and Moi's emergence from an
understudy to the ``Mzee'' (Old Man) to the starring role in Kenyan
politics, the schoolteacher-turned-president has taught all
would-be challengers to dance to his drums.
   Through shrewd political maneuvering, the church-going,
teetotaling Moi, a member of the minority Kalengin tribe, has
amassed power that rivals even the lionized Kenyatta's.
   Kenya is by law a one-party state and Moi is boss of the ruling
Kenyan African National Union, a body he says is supreme to the
government.
   Parliament is essentially a rubber stamp to the president's
wishes, and recent constitutional changes have brought the
judiciary more under the executive's control.
   Kenyatta, too, ran Kenya with a tight rein and tolerated no
dissent. So pervasive was his rule that many doomsayers predicted
Kenya would be torn apart by tribal warfare after the death of
Kenyatta, who was a member of the predominant Kikuyu tribe.
   But when the Mzee died on Aug. 22, 1978, Moi, the third and
longest-serving of Kenyatta's vice presidents, peacefully succeeded
him. Within 90 days, as specified by the constitution, Moi called a
presidential election. He won it unopposed and was sworn in as
Kenya's second president Oct. 14, 1978, the date he observes as the
beginning of his presidency.
   In the following months, government officials released details
of what they said had been a plot during Kenyatta's waning days to
kill Moi rather than allow the presidency to fall into the hands of
a non-Kikuyu.
   Though there were no arrests, officials privately linked the
plot to unidentified Kenyatta aides and relatives who months before
had tried unsuccessfully to thwart the constitutional transfer of
power to Moi.
   Moi retained many of Kenyatta's political allies, although some
were his political enemies. It was only in September that he
succeeded in ridding the party of the last vestiges of Kenyatta's
power clique.
   In a week of party elections _ beginning with grassroots
balloting and ending with selection of national officers _ Moi
retained the party presidency, Kenya's supreme political job, but
the eight officers under him changed, cementing Moi's power base.
   During his 15 years of rule after independence from Britain,
Kenyatta would wave a flywisk, his symbol of office, and lead
cheering crowds in Kiswahili chants of ``Harambee'' (Let's pull
together).
   Moi, saying he and the nation would be guided by the course
Kenyatta had charted, adopted as his symbol of office and Poer a
gold and ivory baton and proclaimed a new slogan: ``Nayo''
(FootstEp).
   In his first days in office, Moi emptied the jails of political
detainees, but began his own detentions after junior officers of
the air force unsuccessfully tried to overthrow him on Aug. 1, 1982.
   Five people are now detained under a security law that allows
the government to jail people indefinitely without trial. About 100
other people _ including journalists, lawyers, academics and civil
servants _ have been jailed in the past 30 months after confessing
links with several groups accused of plotting to overthrow Moi.
   The campaign against purported dissidents brought unaccustomed
criticism of Moi and Kenya from human rights groups and others who
charged confessions were coerced and that civil liberties were
being trampled.
   ``President Moi has presided over a steady deteroriation of the
rule of law,'' Rose Styron, chairwoman of the judge's panel of the
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, said in September when
announcing that the Kenyan lawyer and former political detainee
Gibson Kamau Kuria was the 1988 winner.
   ``Kenya today is a land where only the animals are truly free,''
she said.
   Moi is popular with Kenya's masses and enjoys the reputaton with
Western governments as a moderate. He has cordial ties with most of
his African peers, but is cool to military rulers.
   He has made Kenya the West's best friend in Africa. Western
governments, in turn, hold Kenya up to other African nations as an
example, citing its robust capitalist economy and cooperation among
the races.
   Moi's Kenya remains a mecca for tourists. It's able to feed
itself, a rarity in Africa, and is one of the few countries in the
region not troubled with civil war.
   Kenya's economy is one of Africa's success stories, but has
started to stagger under the burden of the world's fastest-growning
population _ a nearly 4 percent pace that is expected to double the
22 million population by the beginning of the century.
   The population includes 300,000 non-blacks, most of them
``Asians,'' the collective name for people from the Indian
subcontinent. There are about 60,000 ``Europeans,'' the name
Africans assign to all whites.
   On the eve of Kenya's independence in 1963 and despite his armed
Mau-Mau revolt in 1952-56 against British rule, Kenyatta appealed
to whites and other non-Africans to stay put and to help build
black-led Kenya. Most did and many continue to prosper under Moi.
   Minorities, especially the Asians, still control a
disproportionate amount of Kenya's economy _ from groceries and
clothing stores to major factories.
   But whites have no political clout.
   Philip Leakey, son of anthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey, is
the only non-black member of Parliament and serves as an assistant
minister of tourism and wildlife. His brother, Richard, is director
of Kenya's museums.
   Moi, 64 years old and divorced, is a private person. He does not
give interviews. Most of his comments are gleaned from his frequent
appearances at public rallies where he staunchly defends Kenya and
his government.
   ``We are a sovereign state and can stand on our feet,'' he said
recently in at attack on foreign critics. ``We are not under
anyone's feet.''
   The Kenyan press, one of the most sophisticated in Africa, is
assailed by a chorus of protests, often led by Moi, when it
publishes stories that are not to the government's liking. A
church-run magazine, Beyond, was banned earlier this year after
publishing an article alleging fraud during primary elections.
   Nowadays, clergymen and the Law Society of Kenya are the only
public critics of government and even their protests are presented
so as not to offend or even mention the head of state.
   ``We are conscious of a certain inadequacy of dialogue in the
country,'' the Roman Catholic bishops of Kenya said in a letter to
Moi in November 1986.
   ``At present, discussion is precluded by allegation of powerful
party officials that any questioning of the system is tantamout to
disloyalty,'' the bishops added. ``Already the party is assuming a
totalitarian role.''

   Watching the new movie, ``Imagine: John
Lennon,'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, Yoko Ono.
   ``The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm
responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,'' she said.
Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie
were collected by Ono.
   She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon, which were
edited in such a way that he narrates the picture. Andrew Solt
(``This Is Elvis'') directed, Solt and David L. Wolper produced and
Solt and Sam Egan wrote it.
   ``I think this is really the definitive documentary of John
Lennon's life,'' Ono said in an interview. ``What John was really
about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without
whitewashing.
   ``I did view it. I didn't have them take any footage out.
   ``I wanted the truth. In the sense you had to put a 40-year life
into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration. I
think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so.''
   There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments
primarily by Lennon, tied in with the film and using the same title.

   ``Imagine'' is more than a Lennon elegy. Though it fails to
delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles
(drug use, abusive tempers, manager Brian Epstein's death), it does
capture the music and the times in which Lennon lived.
   One intriguing episode in ``Imagine'' shows cartoonist Al Capp
(``L'il Abner'') being antagonistic toward the Lennons during their
bed-in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their
concern for peace.
   ``We were naive,'' Ono said. ``A lot of things happened because
we were naive. Maybe that was our strength. To us, Al Capp was just
a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal, with
a sense of humor. We didn't expect hostility.
   ``Al Capp is one incident that was filmed. In those days we did
numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace. ... There
were some very rough interviews. The hostility that was shown to us
bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible. Each time, I
think we were hurt.''
   Ono said Lennon wrote the song ``Imagine'' in 1969 or '70. ``We
did the bed-in, the Toronto Peace Festival, the `War's Over'
billboard. He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept
of world peace. I think it's one of the songs that will really go
on forever in people's minds.''

   Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940. He was shot and killed outside his
Manhattan apartment on Dec. 8, 1980.
   Ono was a painter when Lennon met her. She later joined him in
music and in public demonstrations for peace.
   ``I think that for somebody like me, because I feel that I'm an
artist and a creative artist, that it is a very strange turn of
events that I'm known as a widow,'' she said.
   ``But it is stranger to me that I'm not that disturbed by it. I
think that John promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow
it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a
context of a partnership with him. ... I think it is my turn to
promote him. He promoted me.''
   When Albert Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon'' was published
in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices,
faults and neuroses, Ono called it ``totally fiction.''
   Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from
friends and fans. ``I was very touched and thankful that people
sent letters to me and extended hands at this time, very warmly. I
really appreciate that. I was also surprised that so many people
stood up against it (the Goldman book). I didn't expect that,'' Ono
said.
   Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird, also has written a new book,
``John Lennon, My Brother.'' She has no idea how many books have
been written about Lennon; she's been sent some of them but hasn't
read them. ``I know the life and it is too painful to read somebody
else's version.''
   There's still enough footage, Ono said, for another movie _
perhaps a music or political or art film. And there's another big
John Lennon project on her horizon.
   ``It's from unpublished songs which were written for a Broadway
musical. I don't know if it would have gotten to Broadway. You aim
for the stars, you know. The songs might be strung together. They
might become a record, might eventually become a musical. There are
enough finished songs. They were never recorded in the studio.
They're on cassettes.''
   Their son Sean, 13, like his older half-brother, Julian, has
become interested in music and started playing guitar.
   ``I had reservations about Sean going into the music field. I
still do. But I kind of gave up on it,'' Ono said.
   ``He is into guitar now. A session musician, a very good one,
was teaching him. According to this teacher, it seems like he is
very good. He is just totally involved in it, listening to Eric
Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, his dad's songs _ only for guitar playing, I
think.
   ``He is into it so much, good luck to him.''

   Building products giant Manville Corp., nearly
brought to ruin in 1982 by billions of dollars in asbestos-related
lawsuits, is a changed company on the verge of shedding its Chapter
11 protection.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's rejection this past week of the last
challenge to Manville's reorganization plan virtually assures its
emergence from ``the wind tunnel,'' as Tom Stephens, chief
executive officer, describes the company's six-year Chapter 11
odyssey.
   Without explanation, the Supreme Court turned down the challenge
by MacArthur Co., a Minneapolis company that for years distributed
Manville asbestos products.
   MacArthur has 25 days to seek a second Supreme Court review, but
has not indicated whether it will. If the company waives a second
review, Manville would have just 30 days of legal requirements
before it could emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization.
   ``It's a day we've worked for for a long, long time,'' said
Stephens, who has guided Manville through the last two years of
reorganization.
   When Manville filed for Chapter 11 protection on Aug. 26, 1982,
it was being deluged with asbestos injury and property-damage
lawsuits at a rate of 400 a month. By 1986, property damage claims
alone had come to a staggering $85 billion, or about 40 times the
company's total assets. The company also faced more than 17,000
personal injury claims in the billions of dollars.
   The Chapter 11 filing allowed Manville to operate in an
interest-free environment safe from the mounting injury and damage
claims and to draft a more than $2.5 billion trust-fund plan to pay
asbestos victims.
   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved Manville's reorganization
claims payment plan in December 1986, but challenges have delayed
its implementation.
   Now, with the last hurdle nearly behind it, a refitted Manville
is poised to begin operation free of court protection and
supervision.
   The reorganization plan has been praised and pilloried.
   Phillip Schaeffer, a bankruptcy specialist with the investment
firm Cowen & Co., described it as ``a work of art, a stunningly
magnificent document.''
   Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst with Martin Simpson & Co., a
New York investment research firm, said Manville shareholders will
be big losers. They will see their stake diluted, winding up with
one share of new Manville stock for every eight shares they hold
today.
   ``Basically, they wiped out their shareholders,'' said Crary.
``I'm disgusted with the way Manville conducted itself. It's been
guilty of a gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility to
shareholders.''
   Stephens, however, said the plan protects shareholders while at
the same time addressing the asbestos claims problem.
   ``To all those who said the filing was inappropriate, I think
the $2.6 billion is testimony to the fact that Manville has dealt
effectively with the problem,'' he said following the Supreme Court
ruling.
   Schaeffer said the plan will help Manville remain a financially
and operationally healthy company.
   ``Even assuming a mild recession, the recent cost-cutting
measures that Manville has undertaken _ the elimination of
low-profit or no-profit businesses and the acquisition of
high-profit businesses _ will allow Manville significant cash flow
and profitability in the future,'' he said.
   The reorganization plan calls for establishment of a Personal
Injury Settlement Trust, to settle claims of asbestos health
victims for the next 25 years. Manville already has paid $150
million into the trust, and its insurers will pay another $615
million immediately. Beginning in 1991, Manville will make annual
payments to the trust of $75 million until 2012.
   A second trust, called the Property Damage Settlement Trust,
would settle asbestos-related property claims. Manville is
obligated to pay $100 million cash immediately to this trust, and
the company's insurance carriers also will contribute millions of
dollars.
   In addition, Manville faces immediate cash obligations of $247.5
million to commercial creditors once it emerges from bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The Supreme Court's ruling brings the plan closer to
implementation for thousands of asbestos victims around the nation.
   ``I am praying that this is the end of the road for us,'' said
Heather Maurer, executive director of Asbestos Victims of America,
based in Soquel, Calif. The group has more than 13,000 members
across the country.
   While some analysts question whether the trust payments will
drain the company's cash flow and profits over the next quarter
century, others say the payments are arranged so that Manville may
juggle its trust-payment obligations while continuing to expand.
   Manville, which made a $164 million profit on $2.06 billion in
sales last year, today consists of three parts: a Fiber Glass
Group, which produces insulation products and glass fibers; a
Forest Products Group, producing wood and paper products, and a
Specialty Products Group, making diverse goods ranging from
commercial-industrial lighting to filter materials for the beer and
wine industries.
   ``The fascinating part of the bankruptcy is that we've designed
a $2 billion company from scratch,'' said Stephens.
   He said the reorganized Manville is a blend of mature
businesses, such as fiberglass and forest products, and growth
businesses, in its Specialty Products Group.
   ``To optimize the value for shareholders, what you like to do is
have growth and maturity,'' he said. ``If you just have growth with
no cash flow, then you tend to leverage. And then when things go
bad, negative leverage will kill you.
   ``So, it's like a sonata. It's a carefully orchestrated
balance.''

   No matter how good the statistics on the economy
get these days, they don't seem to be good enough to quell fears on
Wall Street of an approaching recession.
   By most standards, the figures on the pace of business activity
and growth have been very upbeat of late.
   The latest case in point: The Labor Department's report Friday
of a drop in the unemployment rate from 5.6 percent in August to
5.4 percent in September.
   While job growth continued, it occurred at a relatively subdued
rate, which suggested that the economy was neither getting too hot
nor catching a chill.
   Analysts said the Federal Reserve Board probably would like the
figures enough to decide against any further credit-tightening in
its battle against inflation.
   Meanwhile, the passage of time has made it increasingly apparent
that last year's stock market crash was not the immediate precursor
of a corresponding plunge for the economy.
   The stock market has been holding its ground lately because of
``a total absence of any sign of a recession,'' in the words of
Henry Gailliot, president of Federated Investment Counseling, a
Pittsburgh-based money management firm.
   Yet Gailliot, like a good many other observers, believes the
gains recorded by stock prices this year have represented nothing
more than a ``bear market rally,'' and argues that a recession is
likely by next year.
   ``If this business cycle is to move toward recession in the
standard sequence, which involves capacity strains in finance,
industrial output and employment, the recession will occur in
1989,'' he maintains.
   ``The overextended consumer will stop in a not very different
fashion from the overextended stock market, which stopped in August
of 1987.''
   Not everyone shares this view, of course. For the nearly six
years since the current period expansion began, the optimists have
been right and the frequent warnings from the pessimists have
proved wrong.
   ``We do not anticipate a recession soon,'' said Jim McCamant,
editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter, in the latest issue
of that investment advisory publication.
   ``It is important to look at the economy sector by sector,
rather than always concentrating on the aggregate numbers.
   ``During this long period of prosperity, we have had some
serious recessions in a number of different industries. The oil
supply industry is still in its recession.
   ``The `Rust Belt' companies are now in the early stages of an
economic recovery, helped by strong exports. In this sector the
recovery is still very young and is far short of previous cyclical
peaks.''
   The optimistic camp got a lift late in the past week when the
stock and bond markets responded enthusiastically to the employment
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed Friday at
2,150.25, up 37.34 points from the week before and not far from the
post-crash closing high of 2,158.61 it reached on July 5.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.24 to 156.81,
and the American Stock Exchange market value index gained 2.19 to
303.82. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market,
weighed down by selling in high-technology issues, dropped 2.04 to
385.67.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 166.65 million shares a day,
against 134.94 million the week before.
   Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, argues
that forecasting a recession based on traditional economic-cycle
reasoning is misguided because economic circumstances have changed.
   He says ``market capitalism'' and intense global competition now
exert forces of discipline on the economy that, in effect, regulate
activity much more effectively than government policymakers used to.
   ``Severe busts will no longer be necessary to unwind the
excesses caused by booms,'' he contends. ``Excesses won't be
allowed to build in the first place.''

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Calls For FAA Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration
should be freed of bureaucratic red tape and made an independent
government corporation, similar to Amtrak, U.S. Secretary of
Transportation James Burnley said Thursday.
   Burnley said regulation of aviation safety should remain in the
Transportation Department. But he told the Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association the FAA needs independence to ``do a much better
job of modernizing air traffic control and keeping pace with
growth.''
   The AOPA represents private aircraft owners and pilots.
   ``The FAA is a unique federal agency because it combines three
distinct and somewhat contradictory missions,'' Burnley said. He
said the FAA is charged with establishing and enforcing aviation
safety regulations, providing air traffic control service and
encouraging development of civil aeronautics and air commerce.
   Burnley said he wanted to retain control of aircraft safety
because ``aviation will do much better in the annual budget battles
with the Office of Management and Budget and Congress with a
cabinet secretary as its spokesman.''
   Burnley also called on Congress to act on a ``tort liability
crisis in general aviation manufacturing'' that has resulted in
insurance costs rising fivefold since 1981, while sales have
dropped from 17,000 planes in 1979 to 1,500 in 1986.
   ``While Congress procrastinates on the resolution of this urgent
issue, general aviation manufacturers in Europe are poised to
invade U.S. markets,'' Burnley said.
   Burnley also said:
   _He was concerned by alcohol and drug abuse among pilots, noting
that indictments were handed down in Tampa, Fla., last week
``against some two dozen pilots for failing to disclose convictions
for drug and alcohol related offenses on the Airman Medical
Certificates they provided to the FAA.''
   _Nationally, there is ``a dire need for airport expansion and
improvement. A major airport has not been constructed in the United
States since Dallas-Fort Worth opened in the mid-70s,'' although he
noted that Adams County, Colo., residents voted in May to permit
Denver to annex land for a new hub airport.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Unable To Sustain Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices have wilted following a
technical rally that failed to shake off market concerns about
Saudi Arabia's threats to overproduce crude.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate rose 6 cents to settle at $12.66 a barrel
on Thursday, but other contract months settled as much as 15 cents
lower. The near-term contract had been up as much as 30 cents
during the session.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .06 cent to settle at
39.50 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.52 cent to
37.24 cents a gallon. Other contract months finished lower.
   Traders said a technical rally gripped the market, pushing
prices higher by midday, but broke down shortly thereafter on a
dearth of encouraging news.
   ``The market still looks sick,'' said Chris McCormack, a trader
at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He said participants were continuing
to focus on Saudi Arabia's production levels.
   Earlier this week Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter, threatened not to restrain its own production if other
members of the 13-nation OPEC cartel continued to pump beyond their
quotas.
   ``That's old news, but it's still the focus of the market, and
there's a feeling that Saudi Arabia has not yet achieved its goals
and will continue to pressure prices,'' McCormack said.
   The Saudis have indicated they want to punish other members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for overproducing
and driving down the price of oil.
   Traders also remained concerned about a report that surfaced
Wednesday that said Exxon Corp. chartered a number of tankers to
transport a substantial amount of oil out of the Persian Gulf,
presumably from Saudi Arabia.
   The market interpreted the report as further ``confirmation that
Saudi Arabia has increased production,'' said Andrew Lebow, a
trader at E.D.& F. Man International Inc.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Improve From August, But Sluggish Trend Remains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   September reports from the nation's largest general retailers
have given no indication that the companies' 19-month-old sales
slump will end soon, but industry analysts say storeowners have
taken steps to protect their profits.
   ``Sales for the early part of the month through mid-month
recorded a nice uptick,'' but retailers were unable to sustain that
improvement the rest of September, Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said after reviewing Thursday's
reports.
   Retailers hoped September would end the sluggish sales trend
that began a year and a half ago, but last month's numbers
``weren't quite as good as expected,'' said Karen Sack, an analyst
with Standard & Poor's Corp.
   ``It doesn't look like the turnaround that people expected will
be here,'' Ms. Sack said, predicting retailers would see only
modest sales increases for the rest of 1988.
   But retailers have kept inventories lean and pared expenses,
steps that should help their third-quarter earnings, said Jeffrey
Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co.
   Ms. Sack agreed, saying, ``We're not going to see the kind of
pressure on their margins,'' as in recent quarters.
   ``I think it's safe to say the worst is over for retailers,''
she said.
   The analysts said softness in retail sales was not necessarily a
sign of weakness in consumer spending, which is watched closely as
an economic indicator because it accounts for two-thirds of the
gross national product.
   ``Consumers are spending at a very high rate _ they've just been
moving to other areas like durables,'' said Monroe H. Greenstein,
an analyst with the investment firm Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.
   Ms. Sack noted consumers also have been spending more for
services _ such as utilities and medical care _ leaving them less
money for general merchandise and apparel.
   Apparel sales, which have been in a year-long slump of their
own, improved slightly last month, but analysts still described
them as weak.
   Several retailers recorded sales increases of 3 percent or less
_ meaning they continued to lose ground to inflation, which has run
at an annual rate of 4.6 percent so far this year.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall sales rose 6.6 percent in September and 5.7 percent for the
first 35 weeks of the fiscal year. Sales from Sears stores open at
least a year _ known in the trade as same-store or comparable sales
_ were up 1.6 percent last month and 2 percent for the year to date.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures
which include sales from new stores. But not all retailers report
both overall and same-store results.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 7.1 percent last month
and 5.6 percent for the cumulative 35-week period. Same-store sales
were up 3 percent for September and 2 percent for the year to date.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its sales were up 25 percent overall
last month, while climbing 30 percent so far this year. Same-store
sales, meanwhile, were up 10 percent in September and 11 percent
for the year to date.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales rose 1.3 percent in
September, and 1.7 percent for the year to date. Penney's
same-store sales were up 0.7 percent for the month and 0.6 percent
so far this year.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales rose 15.1 percent
last month, and 16.9 percent for the year to date. Same-store sales
picked up 2.9 percent in September and 1.7 percent so far this year.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 21 percent
in September while picking up 14.6 percent so far this year.
Same-store sales were up 3 percent for the month and 1.6 percent
for the year to date.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its September sales rose 13.7 percent,
while year-to-date sales rose 12.2 percent. Same-store sales rose
7.2 percent for the month and 5.9 percent for the first 35 weeks.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its sales were up 3.5 percent in
September and 3.1 percent so far this year.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
said its overall sales rose 11 percent last month and 6 percent for
the year to date. Limited's same-store sales were up 7 percent in
September _ an improvement over the company's performance in recent
months _ while falling 1 percent over the cumulative 35-week period.
   Apparel sales began slumping in August 1987, when many women
turned away from shorter skirts and fashions they considered boring.
   The results reported Thursday were from general merchandise and
apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by
the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers,
supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>Digital and Tandy Announce Joint Venture To Develop and Market PCs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. struck out the first time
it tried to manufacture personal computers, so in its second
venture into the market it is relying on a specialist.
   Tandy Corp. will make personal computers to Digital's
specifications, which Digital will market and sell under its brand,
Geoffrey Burr, a Digital group manager for strategic relations,
said Thursday.
   ``The personal computer market has moved more and more into a
commodity orientation. Digital doesn't feel that we (should be)
using our resources to try and compete in manufacturing that kind
of product,'' Burr said. ``So we cut out and made an agreement with
a company which is.''
   The agreement comes two days after Digital announced its first
licensing agreement ever to allow an outside firm to manufacture
its computers. On Tuesday, Digital and Allen-Bradley Co. of
Cleveland announced an alliance designed to strengthen Digital's
hold in the manufacturing automation market.
   ``It's desirable for DEC to be able to provide the complete
computing needs to any major customer from the personal level to
the super-minicomputer level,'' said Bruce Watts, an analyst and
managing director of Needham & Co.
   ``Most analysts would agree that DEC is making the right
decision in augmenting their product line through outside
suppliers,'' Watts said.
   Watts said Digital missed the boat with its first attempt at a
personal computer line five or six years ago.
   ``DEC had a major false start in personal computers when they
introduced a number of products, including a product called Rainbow
(and) ... they didn't meet with a great deal of success,'' Watts
said. ``For one reason or another the personal computer was not
their focus at that time.''
   Burr said the arrangement with Tandy was in response to customer
demand.
   ``Digital has been asked to provide support for a range of
different vendors and we have concluded agreements with several of
those companies to provide full service and support,'' he said.
   Digital agreed to service and certify certain Tandy personal
computers to operate in Digital networks. Company officials refused
to describe the computers in detail.
   Dean Burran, the marketing manager for Digital's personal
computer group, said the new machines would differ from Tandy's own
line in extra features that will make them fit easily into
Digital's networking system.
   Tandy spokesman Mark Yamagata said he was not able to reveal a
product line. ``We're their manufacturing source. We will work to
develop the computers to their specifications,'' he said.
   Sonny Monosson, an independent analyst who has followed Digital
for 20 years, said Digital has created systems in the past to
interface with software from other companies. But he said this was
Digital's first marketing agreement with another company.
   ``I wonder how Apple, Compaq, Olivetti are going to feel about
this new arrangement,'' Monosson said. ``This is the first product
that they are offering to distribute through their sales
operation.''

<HEAD>Renew Steel Import Quotas, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study provides ammunition for companies
that want the United States to extend soon-to-expire steel import
quotas with the European Community, Japan and other nations,
according to one steel-state senator.
   The study, released Thursday by three Washington attorneys and
economist William Noellert, says conditions that led to negotiation
of steel import barriers by the Reagan administration in 1984 _
namely, intervention by foreign governments to help their
steelmakers compete in world markets _ have not changed.
   The study will help steel makers convince the public the
five-year quotas, which expire in the fall of 1989, should be
continued, said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   ``The American public will have the facts about the extent to
which foreign governments have rigged the world's steel supply, and
about the failure of the U.S. government to do anything about it
until the eleventh hour,'' Heinz said.
   Noellert and attorneys Thomas Howell, Jesse Krier and Alan Wm.
Wolff all work for the Washington firm of Dewey, Ballantine,
Bushby, Palmer and Wood. Their research was financed partly by six
American steel companies that are on record as favoring
continuation of the quotas.
   In conjunction with the release of the study, those six
companies released their own statement on import ceilings during a
press conference Thursday.
   ``The United States should not dismantle this system until the
international distortions which give rise to the policy in the
first place have been eliminated,'' said the statement by Armco
Inc., Bethlehem Steel Corp., Inland Steel Industries Inc., LTV
Steel Co., National Steel Corp., and USX Corp.
   Congressional pressure and a finding by the U.S. International
Trade Commission that the steel industry was being harmed by
imports led the Reagan administration to negotiate five-year import
agreements with Japan, South Korea, the European Community and
other leading steel exporters in 1984. The agreements placed
product-by-product caps on the amount of steel than can be imported
into the United States each year.
   Since the quotas took effect, the foreign share of the American
steel market has dropped from 26.4 percent in 1984 to 21.3 percent
in 1987, according to Thursday's study, called ``Steel and the
State.''
   The steel industry, which cut its workforce from 500,000 in 1973
to 163,000 in 1987, was profitable last year for the first time
since 1981.
   Given continuing government subsidies of foreign steel
operations, the study said it would be ``imprudent, if not
foolhardy, to permit completely open access to the U.S. market...''
   The study said that even with the quotas, the United States has
permitted a much higher level of steel imports than Japan or Europe
would consider acceptable.

<HEAD>Kroger Axes 300 Workers In Anti-Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co. has announced a round of layoffs
under a $4.6 billion restructuring aimed at thwarting an unwanted
takeover, with 300 corporate headquarters workers from vice
presidents to secretaries getting their walking papers.
   Kroger officials said Thursday that the firings of 300 of its
800 corporate employees would enable it to save $13 million a year
and defend the company from takeover attempts.
   The workers were told only hours earlier that they would be let
go, although rumors of mass layoffs had circulated all week. All
were covered by severance packages that provided up to nine months'
pay, plus insurance and other benefits, Kroger said.
   ``They're not finished yet,'' said Scott Hatch, who still has
his job in the management information systems department. ``It's
like watching a horror film and knowing it's coming, but you don't
know when.''
   ``Seeing your friends go is the hardest part. There are a lot of
depressed people right now,'' said Sharon Hillenbrand, who was
fired from her job in the transportation department. ``It was not a
surprise.''
   As part of the restructuring, Kroger also plans to pay
shareholders a special $48 a share dividend _ $40 in cash and a
bond it values at $8.
   The supermarket company also has plans to sell certain
businesses in order to help cut costs and streamline operations.
   Kroger last month proposed the restructuring to fend off
unwanted takeover offers from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a New
York investment firm, and the Haft family, which controls retailer
Dart Group Inc.
   Kohlbeg Kravis on Tuesday raised its offer to $5.03 billion, or
$64 a share in cash and securities, and proposed to buy Kroger
whether or not it restructured. Kroger had not responded publicly
to Kohlberg's offer by late Thursday.
   Dart Group, which last month began the bidding competition for
Kroger, stated Wednesday it was interested in working with Kroger
to enhance the restructuring by providing more equity _ a statement
some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance to help Kroger
fend off Kohlberg Kravis.
   The Hafts, of Landover, Md., opened the Kroger bidding Sept. 19
with an unsolicited offer of $55 per share, or $4.32 billion. The
Hafts have not increased their offer.

   Stock prices rose slightly at midday Friday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 2
points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,840.9 around 1 p.m. local time.
   Volume totaled 373.1 million shares, compared with 356.1 million
at the same time Thursday.
   Traders said much of the market's attention focused on RTZ
Corp.'s sale of its 28 percent holding in London and Scottish
Marine Oil, also known as Lasmo.
   Trading volume in Lasmo amounted to 100 million shares by
midday, or more than one-quarter of the total shares traded on
London's Stock Exchange.
   Otherwise, traders said, the market was generally quiet in
anticipation of the release of U.S. unemployment figures for
September.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community will
not oppose Japan's request for a special international trade panel
to resolve their dispute over the EEC anti-dumping policy, an EEC
spokeswoman said Friday.
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the spokeswoman said the
EEC was confident its policy conformed with international trade
rules. ``We are utterly serene'' about the formation of the panel,
said the official.
   Japan has contended that the EEC's imposition of anti-dumping
duties on locally-assembled Japanese electronic typewriters and
other products violates international trade rules.
   Specifically, the Japanese government believes that the EEC is
violating a rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that
requires locally based foreign manufacturers to be treated in the
same manner as their domestic counterparts.
   A decision to form the panel likely will be made at a meeting on
Oct. 19 of the GATT council, the international trade body, the
spokeswoman said.
   Earlier this week, the European Court of Justice rejected a
complaint by a number of Japanese companies that the Commission
used faulty accounting methods in anti-dumping cases.

   Toyota Motor Corp. and state officially
embraced each other during a dedication ceremony of the Japanese
automaker's $800 million plant in rural Kentucky.
   Nearly 1,700 Toyota employees, government officials and
community leaders attended the 1{-hour ceremony Thursday inside the
mammoth Scott County facility that has been in production of
four-door Camry sedans since mid-July.
   The Lexington Philharmonic provided an assortment of classical
pieces and a composition dedicated to Toyota. The ceremony's theme,
``Toyota ... Moving Forward With America'' was placed in white
two-foot letters on the blue curtain behind the podium.
   ``The world has watched while Kentucky and Toyota have worked to
make this plant a reality,'' Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said.
   Several speakers repeated the theme of cooperation between the
United States and Japan.
   ``(Thursday's) ceremony represents a new spirit, one of
pioneering new economic, cultural and manufacturing ideals,'' said
Shoichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. ``A spirit of
successfully merging the manufacturing ideals and practices of two
nations in order to bring a new tradition of success.''
   ``This is a historic moment for Kentucky, for America, for Japan
and for Toyota,'' said Kaneyoshi Kusunoki, president of Toyota
Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A., Inc. ``This event will represent a
small step that will continue to advance growing U.S.-Japan
relations.''
   The plant is Toyota's first wholly owned automobile
manufacturing complex in the United States. By the end of 1989, it
is expected to be producing 200,000 Camrys annually.

   About 406,000 hourly General Motors Corp. workers
soon will receive performance bonus payments that average $900 to

   Distribution of the checks, which total about $307 million,

her earnings from the previous year, based on the rate of pay and
the number of hours worked.
   The payments are part of the three-year GM-United Auto Workers

   ``These special payments recognize the relationship between an
improved standard of living, technological progress and the
cooperative spirit and teamwork attitude of all employees in
achieving that program,'' said Alfred Warren Jr., GM's vice

   The stock market rallied today on news of
smaller-than-expected employment growth last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.27 to 2,120.02
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 682 up, 234 down and
452 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.91 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6
percent the month before.
   But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment
grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on
Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised
downward.
   Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely
discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking
place, leaving the Federal Reserve in a position to hold off on any
further tightening of credit.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds rose by nearly $10 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields as low as 8.85 percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1[ to 115[; General Motors { to 74|; RJR Nabisco } to
56{, and Philip Morris 1\ to 98[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .67 to 154.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .57 at 301.71.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.24 to
2,107.75, posting a single-digit change for the fifth consecutive
session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 771 up, 605 down and 531 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 153.57 million shares, against 175.13
million in the previous session.

Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Justice Department attorney, siding
with the Soviet Union, told a federal appeals court that
U.S.-Soviet relations will suffer unless an American businessman's
unusual lawsuit is dismissed.
   Douglas Letter said Thursday that the government takes no
position on whether Raphael Gregorian is right or wrong in his
contention that the Soviets libeled him. But he joined an attorney
for the Soviets in arguing that the case should not be tried in
U.S. courts.
   Gregorian, a Palo Alto, Calif., businessman, sued the Soviets
after they revoked his license to do business in Moscow, where he
had been selling medical equipment for 14 years. He was expelled
and branded a spy in an article in the official Soviet newspaper
Izvestia.
   His attorney, Gerald Kroll, told a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in the one-day hearing that Gregorian deserves a
trial.
   However, Letter argued: ``We have been working very closely with
the Soviets and we have made wonderful progress. It's important
that this progress not be set back.
   ``It is our position that under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act, you cannot sue a foreign entity for libel,'' Letter said.
``And even if you can, you can't do it on the facts of this case.''
   Kroll ridiculed Letter's contention that the fate of U.S.-Soviet
relations depends on Gregorian.
   ``I personally think they have bigger people to fry than my
client,'' he told the court.
   Reached by telephone, Gregorian expressed amazement at the
statements about his role in international affairs.
   ``If being fair to me affects our relations with the Soviet
Union, then we don't have any relations,'' he said. ``The question
is why have they (the U.S. government) turned against me? I'm
really too small a guy. ... We're talking about two superpowers.
This is infantile, sophomoric and unfair.''
   One of the appellate judges, Stephen Reinhardt, bristled at the
mention of foreign relations, saying, ``Isn't that something we're
supposed to ignore _ the political considerations _ in reaching our
decision?''
   John Mage, a New York attorney representing the Soviets,
insisted that U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction because the
incidents in question did not occur in the United States. He also
said the Soviet Union is immune from a lawsuit as a foreign
sovereign.
   Kroll argued that the Soviets libeled Gregorian in connection
with a commercial enterprise and that such an action is exempt from
the immunities act.
   Gregorian's problems date back to 1984 when the Soviets said he
could no longer sell medical equipment such as kidney dialysis and
heart-lung machines. The Soviet newspaper then printed a story
denouncing Gregorian as a ``duplicitous negotiator,'' accusing him
of bribery and smuggling and intimating that he was a U.S. spy.
   Gregorian, adamant about his innocence, sued for libel and
demanded payment for medical equipment still in Moscow. The Soviets
dispute his contention that he still has equipment there.
   The Soviet defendants ignored the suit until 1985, when U.S.
District Judge David Kenyon entered a default judgment against
them, awarding Gregorian total damages of $413,000. Of that amount,
$250,000 was for libel.
   The Soviets refused to pay. Kroll said he would seize Soviet
assets and even took custody of a typewriter at an Izvestia
correspondent's Washington, D.C. home as partial payment.
   The Soviets and the U.S. State Department went to court and
asserted immunity from suit under the immunities act.
   Last year Kenyon reversed his own libel judgment, ruling that he
did not have jurisdiction because of immunity considerations. But
he let stand his ruling the Soviets should pay for the medical
supplies.
   Kroll appealed the libel ruling to the 9th Circuit. The Soviets
appealed the contractual award as well as disputing the libel claim.

   Civilian unemployment fell 0.2 percentage
point to 5.4 percent last month as payrolls grew by 255,000 jobs,
100,000 of them in education with the opening of the fall school
term, the government said today.
   The decline erased an August gain and returned joblessness to
July's level.
   With only one more jobless rate to come before the Nov. 8
election, economists said they did not expect the reports for
September and October to help Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis. The October jobless figures will be reported only
four days before the election.
   Across private industry, the job gain was just 142,000. It was
the second straight month of little expansion after average monthly
increases of 300,000 over the first seven months of 1988, the Labor
Department said.
   Assembly-line manufacturing jobs fell by 19,000 atop a loss of
18,000 jobs in August. That reversed an upward trend that had
persisted for 1{ years. Oil and gas industry employment also fell
for the second month in a row after edging up gradually across the
previous 12 months.
   Together, those industries had averaged a monthly job gain of
65,000 from January through July.
   Adult men accounted for nearly all of the decline in the overall
rate last month, with joblessness falling from 4.9 percent in
August to 4.5 percent last month.
   Except for Hispanics, whose rate fell from 8.4 percent to 7.4
percent, there was little change among the various population
groups tracked.
   The September figures show that the number of unemployed
Americans fell by 255,000 to 6.6 million.
   The number of ``discouraged workers,'' those who have given up
the hunt for a job in the belief that they could not find one, rose
from 910,000 to 930,000 in the third quarter of 1988. More than
half of the discouraged workers were women and one-third were
blacks.
   ``Monthly increases in total payroll employment have slowed in
the third quarter, averaging only a little more than 200,000 per
month compared with 340,000 in the first half of the year,'' said
Janet L. Norwood, the commissioner of labor statistics, in
congressional testimony.
   Excluding teachers and other government workers, health services
was the biggest source of new jobs last month, with such payrolls
growing by 62,000. In contrast, the government said, business
services, one of the strongest job sources across the six-year
expansion, showed little growth.
   Wholesale trade added 25,000 jobs in September, continuing a
pattern of consistent growth brought about largely through rising
exports caused by the fallen value of the dollar.
   On the eve of today's report, economists said they had expected
the rate to decline last month.
   ``Even if the unemployment rate went up, Dukakis would not get
any help because the financial markets would react positively,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., a private
consulting house.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group, a consulting
firm based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., predicted that employment,
inflation and trade figures between now and the election all will
paint a rosy economy.
   ``He's not going to get any help from the raw employment
figures,'' Chimerine said of Dukakis. ``If he's going to win on
economics, it's going to have to come from convincing people
there's a problem ahead of us.''
   Vice President and Republican presidential nominee George Bush
has repeatedly focused on the creation of some 15 million new jobs
under the Reagan administration since the end of the 1981-82
recession, which had sent the jobless rate into double digits.
   Making much the same point, President Reagan told reporters this
morning:
   ``We talk about the record 70 months of economic expansion but
these figures tell the real story that people can understand. They
mean paychecks, school clothes and families that can plan a
brighter future.
   ``That's what George Bush and Dan Quayle stand for and that's
what the administration has worked for in the last eight years.''
   Dukakis has countered that the issue is not the number of new
jobs being created, but the quality of those jobs, saying hourly
wages after adjustments for inflation have fallen since President
Reagan assumed office in 1981.
   August figures on inflation and average wages bolstered that
argument. The Labor Department reported that real hourly earnings
in terms of purchasing power dropped 1.3 percent during the month,
the worst decline since the government began collecting figures on
them in 1964.
   The Labor Department said today that average hourly wages rose
0.5 percentage point last month to $9.37 after declining by two
cents an hour from May through August.
   Chimerine said private surveys show wages beginning to
accelerate, ``but very, very slowly'' at an annual rate of between
3.5 percent to 4 percent.
   ``There have be some large increases for entry-level jobs, but
they have not spread throughout the society,'' he said. ``Large
companies, in particular, have been successful in resisting them.''
   An alternate jobless rate, including the 1.7 million members of
the armed forces stationed in the United States, also fell 0.2
percentage point last month _ to 5.3 percent.

<NOTE>EDS: ADDS new 5th graf to UPDATE with report on talks between
Icahn and Trump; picks up 5th graf pvs bg'ng, Lorenzo ``wants ...</NOTE>

   Talks about Texas Air Corp.'s possible sale of
its Eastern Airlines subsidiary to rival Trans World Airlines Inc.
bring together two former bitter adversaries.
   Texas Air apparently has put Eastern on the auction block, just
a few months after Chairman Frank Lorenzo vowed to shareholders
that the ailing unit was not for sale.
   Sources said Thursday that takeover strategist Carl Icahn, TWA's
chairman, was talking with Lorenzo about acquiring Miami-based
Eastern.
   That report came a day after New York developer Donald Trump
confirmed he was negotiating with Texas Air about a possible
purchase of Eastern's air shuttle operation and said a contract
could be signed by next week.
   Icahn was in contact Thursday with Trump, exploring ways in
which the two might buy separate pieces of Eastern, according to a
report in today's editions of the Wall Street Journal.
   Lorenzo ``wants to divest himself of Eastern Airlines one way or
another,'' said Robert Decker, an airline analyst for Duff & Phelps
Inc. in Chicago.
   Trump reportedly would pay more than $300 million cash for the
shuttle, which serves New York, Boston and Washington and is
Eastern's most profitable operation. Some analysts said Trump might
use the shuttle to help draw people to his hotel and casino
properties in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Airline analysts suggested Icahn might be willing to acquire all
of Eastern except the shuttle.
   Icahn and Lorenzo are wily and tenacious executives who dueled
over control of TWA three years ago. A lot has changed since then,
for both men and for the deregulated airline business.
   Lorenzo, whose Texas Air empire went on to acquire Eastern for
$676 million after his TWA bid failed, apparently has decided that
running an unwieldy and fractious airline company is too much
trouble.
   Eastern has been fraught with labor agitation and staggering
financial losses before and since Lorenzo took over. Eastern lost
$120 million in the first half of the year and recently laid off
about 3,000 union employees.
   Texas Air also owns Houston-based Continental Airlines, a
non-union carrier that recently has started to stem its losses.
   For Icahn, who has chased giant companies ranging from USX Corp.
to Texaco Inc. in recent years, the acquisition of Eastern would
make TWA the largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger
miles, an industry measurement of capacity.
   Icahn is said to be interested in Eastern's north-south routes,
especially between New York and Miami, as possible feeders into
TWA's trans-Atlantic routes. Eastern's Latin American and Caribbean
routes also reportedly piqued Icahn's interest.
   Eastern's militant workers, who characterize Lorenzo as a union
buster, have been included in talks with Icahn on the possible sale
of the airline to him, sources familiar with the situation said.
   Such a situation recalls the move by TWA's workers in 1985 to
talk with Icahn about possibly buying that airline, which Lorenzo
was seeking in order to strengthen the operations of his other
carrier, Continental.
   At that time, TWA's pilots and machinists promised Icahn
hundreds of millions of dollars in labor concessions if he took
control, largely because they feared Lorenzo would gut TWA and
replace them with lower-paid workers, a strategy Lorenzo had used
earlier at Continental.
   Now, the Eastern unions favor a sale of the entire airline as a
going concern to a friendly acquirer, while they are opposed to the
sale of individual assets such as the shuttle.
   At a Texas Air shareholders meeting in early June, Lorenzo said
``Eastern Airlines is not for sale.'' He said a study estimated
Eastern's net-asset value at more than $2 billion, or nearly $50
for each Texas Air share.
   But financial analysts have put Eastern's value at closer to
$500 million.
   Icahn might be willing to pay more if Eastern's unions agreed to
labor concessions as part of the deal, analysts and union sources
said.
   Since the TWA takeover, Icahn has faced his own labor problems,
beginning with a bitter strike by flight attendants in 1986.
   The strike failed, but the flight attendants union has continued
challenging Icahn. It petitioned the Department of Transportion to
review his fitness to run the airline earlier this year.
   Icahn also has incurred the wrath of TWA's pilots, who claim he
broke promises to them when he initially acquired control of the
airline. The pilots have sued him on grounds he is borrowing
against the airline's properties without making crucial long-term
investments in equipment.
   Icahn has denied the charges of both unions.

   The stock market gained ground today on news of
smaller-than-expected employment growth last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.38 to 2,119.13
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 756 up, 406 down and
521 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.79 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6
percent the month before.
   But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment
grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on
Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised
downward.
   Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely
discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking
place, leaving the Federal Reserve in a position to hold off on any
further tightening of credit.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds rose by nearly $10 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields as low as 8.85 percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business

   While Pillsbury Co. has not rejected Grand
Metropolitan PLC's $5.2 billion takeover offer, it has become
increasingly hostile toward the British company, warning
shareholders not to be fooled by its ``blitz campaign.''
   In his first major public response to the unsolicited
$60-a-share bid launched Tuesday, Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith
Grand Met was trying to ``stampede'' shareholders and others into
believing the offer was ``good for all our constituents.''
   ``We should not accept Grand Met's words at face value,'' he
said Thursday.
   Smith also told Pillsbury employees to treat the British food
and liquor conglomerate with skepticism when it claims that a
successful takeover would not result in major job cuts.
   Separately, Pillsbury said late Thursday that a Michigan state
judge had upheld a restraining order barring Grand Metropolitan
from buying any Pillsbury stock because of questions over whether a
buyout would violate liquor laws in a number of states.
   Smith and two other Pillsbury officials met privately late in
the day with Gov. Rudy Perpich at the Capitol to brief the governor
on the takeover ``in terms of Pillsbury's perspective,'' Ray Bohn,
Perpich's communications director, confirmed today.
   Bohn said the Pillsbury officials requested the meeting and
spent between 30 and 45 minutes with the governor.
   ``They know that, in terms of legislative prerogatives, there's
not much that can be done because they're a Delaware corporation,''
Bohn said.
   He said the Pillsbury officials asked the governor to check
whether Grand Metropolitan may be violating an old state law
prohibiting companies which produce or distill liquor from owning
retail liquor outlets such as Pillsbury's Steak and Ale restaurants.
   Bohn said Perpich agreed to check with the attorney general's
office and with state Public Safety Commissioner Paul Tschida and
expects to have a response within a few days.
   The Chicago Tribune, in its editions today, quoted Smith as
saying Thursday, ``We're not going to be taken over'' by Grand
Metropolitan. The newspaper said Smith made the comment to the
Tribune ``after a hastily arranged meeting'' with Perpich.
   Smith made his remarks in a letter to employees of the
Minneapolis-based food and restaurant business. The letter also was
distributed to the news media.
   Pillsbury's board of directors is studying the $5.23 billion
buyout offer to shareholders and will make a recommendation ``in
due course,'' Smith said.
   Larry Haeg, a Pillsbury spokesman, said Pillsbury has not
discussed the takeover bid with Grand Met, a major wine and spirits
maker which also owns hotels, betting offices in England and
Ireland, Alpo pet food and Pearle vision centers.
   Grand Met officials have indicated they would not engage in
wholesale job reductions at Pillsbury, but ``Grand Met's history is
filled with just the opposite kind of corporate behavior,'' Smith
said in his letter, which did not cite examples.
   Walter Montgomery, a spokesman for Grand Met in New York,
disputed Smith's remark about job reductions.
   ``The letter is what it is,'' Montgomery said. ``It has a
purpose. You figure it out.''
   Smith also disputed assertions by security analysts, Grand Met
and some newspapers that Pillsbury has few choices in dealing with
the takeover bid.
   ``... They have no idea what programs I've been working on to
add value to this company,'' Smith said. ``But I think there are
significant opportunities to improve the value.''
   Some analysts have said Pillsbury shareholders might have a hard
time rejecting the all-cash offer. Before Grand Met offered $60 a
share, the stock was trading in the range of $39.
   Pillsbury's stock closed down 25 cents to $57.87{ Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Michigan court ruling stemmed from Pillsbury's attempt to
block Grand met by suing the company in 14 states on the grounds a
takeover would violate ``tied-house'' statutes prohibiting liquor
manufacturers from owning retail liquor outlets.
   The decision by Judge Frederick Zeim in Oakland County Circuit
Court marked the second time that such a restraining order has
withstood a challenge by Grand Met, said Johnny Thompson, a
Pillsbury spokesman.
   Of the 14 lawsuits filed, seven have resulted in restraining
orders against Grand Met, Thompson said.
   Grand Met wants an exemption from the statutes, saying it would
sell the Pillsbury's retail liquor outlets if it bought the company.
   Grand Met also announced Thursday that it had lined up an
additional $2.25 billion in financing for the proposed buyout.
   Combined with $3.75 billion in financing already in place, the
revolving line of credit supplied by six European banks gives Grand
Met $6 billion in available funds, Montgomery said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices dipped in early
trading today at the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by
expectations of bearish crop production reports and good harvesting
weather.
   Updated estimates on grain and soybean harvest yields to be
released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture next Wednesday are
expected to show larger amounts than previous figures, and that led
traders to sell, analysts said.
   Dry weather forecast for much of the Midwest over the weekend
was expected to allow active harvesting in both corn and soybeans,
which helped keep the lid on prices.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2} cents lower, with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.30 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1} cents lower, with December at $2.96\ a bushel; oats
were 3\ cents lower to { cent higher, with December at $2.44 a
bushel; and soybeans were 4} cents lower to 2\ cents higher, with
November at $8.08 a bushel.
   Cattle and hog futures prices opened mixed at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .12 cent to .32 cent lower,
with the contract for delivery in October at 72.15 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were unchanged to .32 cent higher, with October at
81.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to .20 cent
higher, with October at 40.05 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .0 cent to .65 cent lower, with February at 8.60 cents
a pound.
   Cattle prices were mostly higher, hog prices were mostly lower
and pork bellies declined in trading Thursday.

<HEAD>Chinese Government to Clamp Down on Capital Investment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese officials have announced tough new
measures to halt construction projects targeted in an upcoming
nationwide crackdown on what the government considers excessive
capital investment, which officials blame for high inflation.
   After Dec. 1, authorities will withhold bank loans, energy and
building supplies and construction licenses from targeted projects
to force them to close down, the official People's Daily reported
Friday.
   The newspaper quoted senior official Chen Guangjian, newly
appointed by Premier Li Peng to spearhead efforts to curb capital
construction.
   He said projects slated for cancellation include those that rely
on imported or scarce domestic raw materials, are underfinanced,
will produce high-energy-consuming goods or goods that are already
made in excess.
   Aside from a handful of projects already approved by the State
Planning Commission, construction will be halted on all office
buildings, auditoriums and hotels begun this year. No new building
will be allowed for two to three years, he said.
   According to a China Daily report, Chen said projects which use
imported technology and foreign funding are expected to escape
cutting.
   Capital investment has grown at a rate of 18.8 percent over the
past three years, far outstripping the 16.4 percent rate of
increase in national income during the same period. The too-rapid
rate of investment has helped fuel an inflation rate currently
about 20 percent.
   Chen said blind emphasis on short-term profits in enterprises as
well as the failure of local banks to abide by state loan quotas
and policies were responsible for ``investment inflation.''
   The Central Committee of the Communist Party launched an attack
on inflation and confusion in the economy in its plenary session
last week, criticizing party members and local officials for lax
discipline in carrying out its economic policies.
   The central government has led repeated drives with little
success against excessive capital investment, including a partial
halt on hotel and theater construction earlier this year.
   Leaders intend the current campaign to be all-inclusive in
scope, subjecting all capital investment nationwide to close
scrutiny.

higher Friday in active trading.
   Mining giant RTZ Corp.'s 260 million-pound ($442 million) sale
of its 28 percent holding in London and Scottish Marine Oil was the
main feature of the day.
   However, interest later dried up as the market paused to catch
its breath and consolidate after advancing sharply over the course
of the week, dealers said.
   Trading volume in Lasmo amounted to 113 million shares Friday,
or about 20 percent of the total shares traded on London's Stock
Exchange, as RTZ's 52 million shares were placed with various
institutions by brokers Cazenove and Co. at 500 pence each ($8.50).
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 5.8
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,844.7.
   The index dropped to a session low of 6.1 points soon after the
market's official 9 a.m. opening.
   Lasmo shares ended 20 pence (34 cents) lower at 531 pence
($9.03).
   Trading volume amounted to 583 million shares, up slightly from
Thursday's volume of 577 million shares.
   Traders said London players also derived some support from a
healthy start on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average was
up 22.23 points at 2,129.98 during the London afternoon.

   Delbert W. Yocam, a 10-year veteran of
Apple Computer Inc., said Friday he will leave the firm in November
1989.
   Yocam will continue to serve as president of Apple's Pacific
division until his departure, but the education division that he
has headed will be moved into the Apple USA division, Apple said.
   Yocam is one of the industry's ``finest executives,'' said John
Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive.
   Apple also announced a variety of other organizational changes,
including the creation of a separate Apple USA marketing group,
encompassing three separate U.S. marketing organizations and the
Marketing Communications group.

<HEAD>Corn, Hog Markets Keep Watchful Eye On Aflatoxin Spread</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers across the Midwest are examining their corn while
traders keep a watchful eye on the market as the discovery of a
cancer-causing toxic mold _ a by-product of this summer's drought _
threatens to curb an already reduced crop.
   Early indications are that aflatoxin, though found already in
several states, will not pose a serious problem, experts say. But
concerns that the progressing harvest will reveal the mold is
widespread have lent support to corn prices at the Chicago Board of
Trade, analysts say.
   And aflatoxin is in the back of the minds of traders at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where prices of hogs _ a major corn
consumer and especially vulnerable to the toxin _ would feel the
effects of an outbreak.
   ``One thought is that it's going to reduce the corn supply,''
said Thomas Morgan, a livestock analyst and president of Sterling
Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``The other concern is that if the contamination becomes too
widespread it will hurt our exports _ countries would not want to
buy'' U.S. corn out of fear of contamination. ``So it could have a
bullish or bearish impact,'' Morgan said.
   But with only about one-third of the nation's corn crop in the
bin, it's too soon to tell, he said.
   The toxin is a metabolic by-product of the fungus Aspergillus
flavus, which primarily affects corn and peanut crops, said Walker
Kirby, a plant pathologist at the University of Illinois.
   The fungus appears on corn kernels in hot, dry weather and
thrives in conditions like this past summer's drought, followed by
the wet fall.
   Ordinarily, the fungus can only be detected through a series of
tests. But on a severely affected ear of corn, it shows up as an
olive-green colored mold, visible to the naked eye, he said.
   After tainted corn is harvested, the fungus will spread in
storage unless the crop is kept cool and dry, Kirby said. Neither
heat treatment nor fungicides destroy the toxin.
   Animals generally begin showing symptoms such as loss of
appetite and weight if fed corn tainted with about 200 to 300 parts
per billion for a period of two months or more, Kirby said.
   In extremely large doses, the toxin can cause liver cancer in
humans. But it is ``highly unlikely'' that humans will be affected
by the outbreak, said Dan Faulkner, an animal sciences professor at
the University of Illinois.
   This year _ like the last aflatoxin outbreak in 1983, another
drought year _ the toxin has been discovered in corn crops
throughout the Midwest.
   A statewide survey in Illinois of 327 corn samples has found
35.8 percent contained toxin levels of above 20 parts per billion,
the state agriculture department said.
   Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, corn
destined for humans or dairy cattle must contain less than 20 parts
per billion of the toxin. Corn for breeding cattle or swine must
contain below 100 parts per billion.
   The FDA this past week revised its standards for corn shipped
interstate, allowing up to 100 parts per billion if the feed is
given only to mature animals.
   The Board of Trade recently announced that ``no corn could be
delivered on our contracts that contained more than the 20
parts-per-billion limit from the FDA guidelines,'' said spokesman
Mark Prout.
   Despite the FDA revision, ``Our limit stays the same, to assure
the users of our markets of the quality of the grain being
traded,'' Prout said.
   Indiana officials estimate that 10 percent to 14 percent of
Indiana corn contains some amounts of the toxin.
   Milk containing unacceptable levels of aflatoxin has been traced
to several Texas dairies.
   The toxin has appeared in Iowa and South Dakota, and testing is
being done in those states as well as in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   ``If we find out that a lot of the corn is affected and is toxic
... it will affect our costs of production down the road,'' said
livestock analyst Chuck Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago.
   ``We're not feeding a lot of the new crop corn yet, we're still
feeding a lot of the old crop corn. But if it really cuts into the
availabilty of corn supplies next year ... it could stimulate some
liquidation of hogs,'' Levitt said. The near-term effect would
likely be a decline in hog futures prices, but the long-term impact
of a diminished corn supply would be bullish.
   ``Tight corn supplies will eventually lead to tighter meat
supplies, you can bet your bottom dollar,'' Levitt said.
   Since the 1983 drought, rapid screening tests have been devised
that can detect the toxin in minutes, Kirby said. At grain
elevators, inspectors first put corn samples under an ultra-violet
light. If kernels glow, the fungus is present, and a rapid
antibody-antigen test is then performed to determine presence and
amount of toxin.
   ``The elevators tell me they're turning away about 5 to 10
percent average corn for having more than 20 parts per billion,''
Kirby said.
   ``If I were a farmer,'' he said, ``I would be sampling my grain,
purchasing a rapid-screening test kit ... I would screen my grain
and I would also be sure that I was storing my grain at a
low-moisture level'' at lower than 70 degrees.
   ``I would definitely be concerned,'' Kirby said, ``but not be
overly concerned. It's a management problem that can be dealt
with.''

   The stock market put together a brisk rally
today on news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 31.47 to 2,139.22
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 998 up, 407 down and
487 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6
percent the month before.
   But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment
grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on
Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised
downward.
   Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely
discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking
place, leaving the Federal Reserve in a position to hold off on any
further tightening of credit.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds rose by about $10 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields as low as 8.85 percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1{ to 115{; Eastman Kodak 1 to 47\; Dow Chemical 1\
to 90}, and General Electric } to 43|.
   Intel dropped 2 to 24| in heavy over-the-counter trading,
registering disappointment among investors over the size of the
third-quarter earnings gain reported by the company.
   Also, Intel said it was anticipating a slight decline in profits
for the fourth quarter from the July-September period.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.92 to 155.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.33 at 302.47.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 145.61 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Chinese Delegation Learns Management At Geneva Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OREM, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 43-member Chinese delegation came away from
its tour of Geneva Steel of Utah this week so impressed that
members said they intend to borrow some of the management ideas
they found at the central Utah plant.
   ``I think we have already learned valuable management
practices,'' said Cai Zhe Shi, deputy director of the Liaoning
Provincial Department of Metallurgical Industry. ``There are some
steel factories in China whose production is not good. We are very
interested in how to effectively manage factories.''
   The delegation, made up of steel industry and government
officials from the People's Republic of China, were in Utah for
management and operational training at Geneva Steel.
   The group plans to spend two months in the United States to take
a closer look at American steel operations. On Saturday, the
delegation was scheduled to fly to New York City.
   Geneva spokesman Barry Bartlett said Geneva _ originally built
during World War II to supplement military steel production _ was
of special interest to the Chinese.
   ``Geneva Steel has a unique distinction of being an older
integrated steel mill that is continually upgraded with new
technology,'' Bartlett said. ``The Chinese have a similar situation
with older steel plants and older manufacturing that they need to
upgrade rather than replace.
   Bartlett said the Chinese are interested in learning how to stay
competitive without investing in brand new technology.
   Chen Shihuan, senior engineer and vice chief of the works at
Chengdu Iron and Steel Works in Sichuan, China, said the Utah plant
is similar to those in China.
   ``We have learned more here about how to use modernization in
the controls of a plant, which allows a plant that is relatively
old with out-of-date equipment to be very productive,'' he
explained.
   Chen operates a steel plant in the southwest region of China
with 7,000 employees who produce 300,000 tons of steel a year. All
steel plants in China are government-owned.
   Bartlett said Utah stands to benefit from the visit as well.
   ``Exporting to China is certainly another possible outcome in
this interaction. In some regions there is a deficit of the steel
industry,'' Bartlett said.
   China Hua-Yang Technology and Trade Corp. is the delegation's
sponsoring agency host from China.

<TEXT>
   WNBC, NBC's radio flagship for 62 years and once
home to Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Fred Allen and the NBC Symphony
conducted by Arturo Toscanini, goes off the air today as a result
of a corporate takeover.
   The new owner is changing the talk and music station, a
clear-channel spot on the dial at 660 that can be heard in 35
states at night, to an all-sports format.
   The station's forerunner was a pioneer with a string of firsts
including such things as the first broadcast of a World Series and
the first broadcast of the national political conventions. It also
had the first broadcast commercial.
   WNBC's signoff, announced Feb. 18, is the result of a $6 billion
deal in 1985 in which General Electric Co. bought RCA Corp., the
parent company of NBC.
   A Federal Communications Commission regulation prevents a new
owner from keeping both a television and a radio station in the
same market. GE decided to sell its new radio properties and keep
the more profitable WNBC-TV.
   GE sold the NBC radio network to Westwood One for $55 million
and sold five stations to Emmis Broadcasting Corp. for $121.5
million. One station is still up for sale, KNBR in San Francisco.
   WNBC signs off at 5:30 p.m. today and turns into WFAN, Emmis'
sports format station, previously heard at 1050 on the dial. WNBC's
frequency, 660, is more desirable from an engineering standpoint.
   The change means about 50 WNBC employees are out of jobs.
   The station went on the air in April 1922 as W2XY, then owned by
AT&T. It became WBAY in July that year and changed to WEAF in
August. RCA bought the station from AT&T for $1 million in 1926
when it formed NBC to help sell the radios it was building. But the
call letters weren't changed to WNBC until 1946.
   ``The format has changed, the personalities have changed, the
call letters have changed, change is inevitable,'' said WNBC
program director Dale Parsons, one of those losing a job.
   WEAF had the first World Series broadcast, Yankees vs. Giants,
in 1923; the first coast-to-coast hookup in 1924; and the first
broadcast of the national political conventions in 1924. In 1925,
it broadcast a presidential inaugural address _ by Calvin Coolidge
_ for the first time.
   The first radio commercial was aired on WEAF on Aug. 28, 1922,
when a real estate developer from across the East River in Queens
paid $100 for a 10-minute announcement to advertise apartments.
   ``Up to that point radio was for experimenters and people were
still thinking of ways to make money with it,'' Parsons said.

<HEAD>Irving Board Authorizes Bank of NY Merger</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: will be led with closing stock price.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp.'s board of directors approved
Friday a management-backed $1.48 billion merger with hostile suitor
Bank of New York Co., ending one of the nation's lengthiest and
most bitter takeover battles.
   The merger will nearly double Bank of New York's size, vaulting
it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies.
The two had a combined $47.8 billion in assets as of June 30.
   The board vote Friday came two days after Irving Chairman Joseph
A. Rice announced he would abandon his year-long resistance to the
proposed acquisition and drop all pending lawsuits and
anti-takeover defenses aimed at stopping Bank of New York.
   Rice also promised to move up his retirement plans and leave
after the deal was completed.
   In return, Bank of New York sweetened its previous hostile offer
by about $200 million by slightly increasing the stock portion of
the bid and adding stock warrants.
   Bank of New York has a tender offer, scheduled to expire Oct.
21, under way for Irving shares. As of Sept. 30, nearly 10.46
million of Irving's 18.9 million outstanding shares had been
tendered to Bank of New York, said Owen Brady, a Bank of New York
spokesman.
   Neither side has commented publicly on the turn of events
leading to the tentative pact. But banking analysts agreed Irving
was forced to negotiate in the absence of any ``white knight''
takeover partner and after an appeals court invalidated Irving's
anti-takeover ``poison pill'' defense.
   The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court on
Tuesday struck down a provision allowing all Irving shareholders _
except a hostile suitor _ to buy $400 worth of Irving shares for
$200 if any suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock
without Irving management support. Such devices are intended to
make unsolicited takeover bids prohibitively expensive.
   Irving had vowed to appeal the ruling to the state's highest
court, the Court of Appeals. But some legal experts questioned
whether that court would have considered the case since the
Appellate Division's decision was unanimous.
   Last spring, Milan-based Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, offered
to merge with Irving as part of a major restructuring of the New
York bank. But it recently withdrew the bid after the Federal
Reserve Board ruled the Italian government agency that owned most
of Banca Commerciale had to supply separate financial imformation.
   The Fed already has given conditional approval for an
Irving-Bank of New York merger.
   Under its revised bid, Bank of New York, which owns 4.9 percent
of Irving, would pay $15 in cash and 1.675 shares of its own stock
for each of Irving's common shares outstanding. It also included
warrants valued at $5 toward the purchase of Bank of New York stock.
   The entire deal was worth about $78.42 a share, or about $1.48
billion, according to Bank of New York figures.
   Irving stock was trading at $74.75 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday afternoon, up $1.12{ from late Thursday.
   All present directors of Irving would be invited to join Bank of
New York's board of directors under the proposed plan, and all key
personnel decisions would be made by a committee of directors made
up of three directors of the Bank of New York and two current
Irving directors.
   When Bank of New York first made its bid on Sept. 25, 1987, it
had the distinction of being the first-ever hostile takeover fight
between two big American banks. It then became the lengthiest such
battle among major U.S. corporations.

   Soybean futures prices plunged Friday at the
Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by a lack of export business and
expections of higher government crop estimates.
   The negative sentiment spilled over into the corn pit, sparking
a selling wave that kept prices down, analysts said. Wheat prices
rallied on ongoing expectations that China and the Soviet Union
plan big purchases, said analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department
Inc.
   Anticipation that updated U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates to be released next Wednesday will show higher soybean
harvest yields helped trigger the sell-off in beans, he said.
   Good harvesting weather forecast for the weekend also added a
negative tone to corn and soybean prices, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December $4.35; corn was 1 cent to 3}
cents lower, with December at $2.94\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
to 3 cents lower, with December at $2.43{ a bushel; and soybeans
were 1 cent to 23} cents lower, with November at $7.89 a bushel.

   Jay Grandy is busy dodging swarms of
forklifts around Snokist Growers' apple warehouses.
   The company president is trying to stay out of the way of 1,400
employees who clean, sort, pack and ship up to 1 million apples per
day as the nation's largest apple crop moves into peak harvest.
   ``The receiving crews are working from 6 in the morning to 9 at
night,'' Grandy said this week. ``We had 50,000 cartons packed last
week.''
   The forklifts are moving 700-pound bins of Red Delicious apples
from trucks to sorting lines, or stacking them 11 high in
refrigerated warehouses.
   And so it will go at 300 warehouses across central Washington
for the next month as crews move 5.7 billion apples, handpicked by
over 40,000 farmworkers, from a crop the industry hopes is a major
improvement over 1987.
   Plagued by a record production, poor quality, weather damage,
falling prices, and a European Economic Community boycott, the 1987
apple crop was a major disaster for the state's 4,500 growers.
   Although the 68 million boxes of supermarket apples were 13
million above the previous state record, prices remained below the
cost of production nearly the entire year.
   As a result, the $312.4 million growers received for apples was
$177 million less than the year before.
   Things were so bad that Snokist, a cooperative with 380 member
growers, failed to pay a dividend for only the second time in its
80-year history, Grandy said. The first time was in 1985 when frost
wiped out 60 percent of the crop.
   This year's harvest is projected at only 57.2 million boxes, and
quality is looking much better, growers say.
   ``This crop is a vintage crop,'' said Charles St. John,
spokesman for the Washington Apple Commission, an industry trade
group. ``It's remarkably good in color, size and inner quality.''
   ``There is awfully high confidence this year,'' he said.
   Part of that optimism is based on national estimates of a crop
of just 111 million boxes, 22 million boxes less than last year.
   That should keep prices up for apples, which trail only potatoes
and lettuce in national produce sales.
   Early market prices of $14 to $16 per 42-pound box are well
above the $9.50 per box growers need to break even. Last year,
prices dropped as low as $5 per box.
   Although 35 states grow apples commercially, Washington produces
about half the nation's supermarket apples each year, and accounts
for over 80 percent of apple exports.
   Michigan ranked second last year with 9.2 million boxes,
followed by New York with 9 million and California with 5.4 million
boxes, the commission said.
   Exports were one of the few bright spots for the 1987 crop,
setting a record despite the spring boycott by the EEC. Washington
growers blamed the boycott on the desire of the European
governments to protect their local growers from competition. The
boycott has been lifted now.
   This year the industry is taking steps to ensure that consumers
will get a crisper apple.
   For the first time, the industry has instituted a firmness
standard that is designed to ensure that top grade apples stay
crisp at least two weeks after they are shipped to supermarkets.
Apples too soft to meet that requirement will be diverted to juice
and applesauce processors.
   St. John said the firmness standard, adopted this summer by the
state Department of Agriculture, cannot guarantee proper handling
by supermarkets, but is designed to ensure a better shelf life for
the fruit.
   ``We lose control once we slam the door on the trucks,'' he said.

<HEAD>IC Files with SEC to Spin Off Illinois Central Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IC Industries Inc. on Friday filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission required for
the spinoff of the Illinois Central Railroad.
   The parent company said it expects to distribute approximately
21 million shares of Illinois Central common stock to shareholders
by the end of the year, after a favorable ruling by the Interstate
Commerce Commission last week.
   Under the proposed plan, IC Industries shareholders willl
receive one share of Illinois Central common stock for each five
shares of IC Industries common stock they hold.
   Application is being made to have the new Illinois Central
common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange, IC said in a
statement.
   IC Industries had earlier obtained a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service that the stock dividend will be tax-free to its
shareholders.
   Before the distribution, IC Industries will contribute to the
railroad $180 million in cash and forgiveness of net advances, plus
$25 million in real estate.
   The parent company has been in the process of spinning off the
railroad to its shareholders since early this year.
   With the spinoff of the railroad, IC Industries will change its
name to Whitman Corp., as previously announced, effective Dec. 1.
Its primary operating companies will then be Pet Inc., a specialty
foods company; Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers; muffler specialist
Midas International Inc.; and Hussman Corp., a manufacturer of
food-service equipment.

<HEAD>From Queens and With King-Sized Egos, Trio Tries To Negotiate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They all hail from Queens, and their egos are
king-sized.
   Corporate raider Carl Icahn, airline cost-slasher Frank Lorenzo
and glitzy real estate mogul Donald Trump speak the language of the
working-class New York borough.
   They have made millions from their brash mega-deals. They live
in luxury. Now each is keenly interested in Eastern Airlines.
   The similarities are startling, but their unyielding tycoon
styles raise the question of whether this ego trio ultimately can
agree on a way to divvy up financially troubled Eastern, part of
Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp.
   Lorenzo is believed to be looking to sell parts or all of
Miami-based Eastern, which has been fraught with labor conflict and
staggering losses before and since he took over.
   ``The question is whether there's a (negotiating) table big
enough to get all three around,'' chuckled one Wall Street
investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's very
difficult to do any three-party deal, and when you have the likes
of those three, it increases the degree of difficulty
exponentially.''
   Icahn, who heads Trans World Airlines Inc., has met with Lorenzo
in the past to discuss the possibility of buying some Eastern
assets. But he re-emerged this week, reportedly interested in
acquiring all of Eastern except for its lucrative shuttle service.
   Enter Trump, of Atlantic City, N.J., hotel and casino fame. He
has his eye on the shuttle, which serves New York, Boston and
Washington.
   Despite the trading floor jokes, one Wall Street source noted
that ``what you've got is three very sharp deal people, and there's
a feeling they can probably come up with something very creative if
they want to achieve the end result.''
   Icahn has retained the quick reflexes of his trader days. In
typical raider fashion, Icahn buys into companies whose assets are
worth more than their stock price, and then makes money selling the
companies later _ whole or in pieces _ unless the companies offer
to buy him out at a premium.
   His target list ranges from USX Corp. to Texaco Inc. The only
deterrent, Icahn has said, is a company's stock price, a most
telling ``report card.''
   A Princeton University graduate and medical school dropout,
Icahn resides in a verdant New York suburb and has designed the
gardens that skirt his mansion. But he is said to be more intensely
interested in business than in indulging in the pleasures of wealth.
   Posing beside him in a photograph that appeared in Business Week
magazine recently was a majestic German shepherd. But his interest
in animals doesn't stop there. Within his business empire are
partnerships that bear the names Gnu Corp., Buffalo Investors
Corp., Wolf Investors and Stork Associates.
   Francisco Lorenzo is a Harvard man. His parents emigrated from
Spain and ran a hairdressing salon in midtown Manhattan, but their
business, he once said, was hit hard by the advent of the
do-it-at-home permanent wave.
   His goal has been to run businesses that are as lean as his
distance-runner's frame. He shocked the industry in 1983 by filing
to reorganize Continental Airlines under federal bankruptcy laws,
firing all 12,000 employees in the process. He hired back only
4,000 at tremendous wage cuts.
   Often projecting a cold, tough-guy persona, Lorenzo threatened
several times to have beefy security guards eject shareholders from
the Texas Air annual meeting in June because they continued their
questioning after he had asked them to refrain.
   Beaming proudly this week when Lorenzo announced a $50 million
deal with Scandinavian Airlines System was his neatly coiffed
mother, who often attends his business functions.
   Trump, a product of military school and the Wharton School,
followed in his father's footsteps when he embarked upon a career
as a developer. But he made his bailiwick Manhattan, rather than
the less tony outer boroughs.
   Success came before he was even 30, and Trump was eager to
accumulate the riches his money could provide. He seems driven to
have his name emblazoned on high-profile properties like
skyscrapers, million-dollar condos, casinos and helicopters.
   In the 1970s he offered to build a $170 million convention
center for the city of New York if his father's name could appear
on it. The city declined.
   Among his recent purchases is the Plaza Hotel, a French
Renaissance landmark adjacent to Central Park, which he purchased
for about $400 million. The 808-room hotel is being run by his
Czech-born wife, Ivana, for ``$1 a year and all the dresses she can
buy.'' Under her tutelage, employees have been instructed to
regularly stamp the sand in the hotel's ashtrays with the Plaza
logo.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia, seeking to restore order
to OPEC's pricing system, is increasing pressure on overproducing
cartel members by stepping up its own oil output _ and industry
analysts predict the tactic will work.
   The strategy _ which has forced the price of oil dramatically
lower _ will enable the Saudis and other members of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stake out
positions prior to key meetings expected to be held this month and
next, the analysts said.
   ``The lower prices get, the better it is,'' said Lucy Mullins,
an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. ``It will force
(the OPEC nations) to realize they have to take some kind of
definite action.''
   Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publication
Petrostrategies, agreed.
   ``The way things are being done is excellent,'' he said.
``Unless there is enough pressure on ... the market, the cheaters
in OPEC will never learn their lesson.''
   World oil prices have plunged recently amid reports of
burgeoning supplies and persistent discord in OPEC. Prices have
been running more than $5 a barrel below the cartel's benchmark of
$18 for a 42-gallon barrel.
   In New York trading Friday, the benchmark U.S. crude, West Texas
Intermediate, closed at $12.94 a 42-gallon barrel, up 28 cents from
Thursday.
   Oil prices took a steep dive early in the week after Saudi
Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, warned it will continue
producing more than its OPEC-set limit unless other cartel members
stick to their quotas.
   Analysts estimated Saudi Arabia has recently pumped some 5.7
million barrels a day, topping its 4.3 million-barrel quota.
   ``It's an attempt by Saudi Arabia to crack the whip,'' said Nick
Antill, an oil analyst with the London brokerage County NatWest.
   Added Terzian, ``If the Saudis continue the pressure on the
market, that's the only way an agreement can be reached.''
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto warned recently prices could
plummet to $5 a barrel if the Saudis exploited their production
capacity to force other cartel members to observe their quotas.
   The bickering in the cartel precedes a joint meeting of two OPEC
committees. OPEC has not yet announced the date or place, but
analysts say Oct. 20 is likely, possibly in Madrid.
   The talks will bring officials of Iran and Iraq to their first
OPEC meeting since an August cease-fire in their nearly 8-year-old
war.
   With the former enemies at the bargaining table, the officials
will likely discuss ways to shape a pact on production limits that
will bring Iraq back into the quota system and discourage cheating
among other members.
   Both Iran and Iraq want to export more oil to pay for enormous
projects needed to rebuild their war-damaged economies.
   Iraq refused to go along with its quota of 1.5 million barrels a
day during the war and demanded a share equal to Iran's 2.4 million.
   But analysts said Iraq has been pumping well above that level,
averaging about 2.7 million barrels a day, and could reach 3.7
million by mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi
Arabia to the Red Sea.
   Iran's output has been estimated at less than 2 million barrels
a day.
   The United Arab Emirates also has exceeded its ceiling of
948,000 barrels. Oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba has set the limit
at 1.5 million barrels.
   Analysts said the upcoming discussions will lay the groundwork
for a meeting of all 13 oil ministers scheduled to begin Nov. 21 in
Vienna, Austria.
   Antill suggested the oil producers might settle on a production
package that would set a cartel ceiling of about 18.5 million
barrels a day. The current level is a bit more than 15 million
barrels, without Iraq.
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that OPEC production, including Iraq, soared to 20
million barrels a day in September, up from 19.8 million in August.
   Under Antill's scenario, Iran and Iraq each would be assigned a
quota of 2.7 million barrels a day and the United Arab Emirates
would be given several hundred thousand barrels a day more.
   Ms. Mullins said the ministers also may consider lowering their
benchmark price from $18 a barrel to $15. The current target, she
said, ``is completely impossible.''
   But Terzian noted the desire of both Iran and Iraq for more
money and argued that keeping a fairly high target would help OPEC
write a new production accord.
   The price evolution committee, one of the two panels meeting
later this month, is made up of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,
Indonesia and Venezuela.
   The other panel, the long-term strategy committee, includes
Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Venezuela.
   The other members of OPEC are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.

<TEXT>
   First Fridays are proving to be full of mostly
pleasant surprises for the bond market. But some analysts see
turbulence ahead.
   For the past two months, the first Friday has meant reassurance
for bondholders worried that the economy may be growing so fast
that inflation will accelerate and take a heavy toll on the value
of their fixed-income securities.
   The first Friday of each month is when the government reports on
the employment situation in the previous month, providing the most
current official glimpse of the state of the economy.
   The reports for August and September have indicated to many
analysts that the economy is growing at a moderate yet still
healthy pace.
   More important, each of the reports was viewed as reducing
chances that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to encourage
higher interest rates.
   This past Friday, the government reported that the September
unemployment rate slipped to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent the
previous month. Most bond traders focused on payroll employment
growth, though, and the September increase of 255,000 jobs fell
45,000 short of expectations.
   The reaction was immediate. Prices jumped and trading volume
swelled after slowing to a trickle in the past few days in
anticipation of the report.
   By midafternoon, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up
more than $15 for every $1,000 in face value and its yield was at
8.80 percent, its lowest level since mid-April.
   The rally was not quite as strong as the one that followed the
release of the August unemployment figures, which saw the
unemployment rate rise to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July and
payroll growth of 219,000.
   Bonds staged one of their biggest advances of the year that day,
with some 30-year Treasury issues rising more than $25 for every
$1,000 in face value.
   Some analysts said the latest report confirmed the conclusion
suggested by the unemployment report a month ago that the economy
was moderating.
   ``It belied the notion that the August figures were an
aberration,'' said Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director
for the investment firm Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp. ``It appears they were the beginning of a new moderate growth
trend for the economy.''
   But other analysts said economy continues to grow at a fairly
strong pace and warned that higher interest rates may lie ahead.
   Leonard Santow, managing director for Griggs & Santow Inc., a
financial consulting firm, said, ``The market was so fearful of
huge increases that the number was greeted with a sigh of relief.''
   He said the market's sharp rise Friday may also have reflected a
delayed response to sharp declines in oil prices earlier in the
week.
   Crude oil prices plunged below $13 a barrel to two-year lows at
midweek, a plus for the inflation outlook, but the bond market
barely moved as traders refused to budge before the unemployment
report.
   On the other hand, some economists said the market may have
ignored in its euphoria the wage data released with the
unemployment report.
   It said, for instance, that real hourly earnings dropped 1.3
percent during the month while average hourly wages rose 0.5
percentage point.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the wage measurements ``provide a
modest hint that there could be some pickup in wage inflation.''
   Can the bond market extend Friday's advance?
   Steven A. Wood, money market economist for BankAmerica Capital
Markets Group in San Francisco, noted that the big rally following
the August unemployment report lasted only a day.
   ``It wouldn't surprise me to see the same kind of reaction this
go around,'' he said, noting that the market runs into some
important producer price and trade balance reports due to be
released in the coming week.

   The stock market rose sharply today, inspired by
news of smaller-than-expected employment growth last month.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6
percent the month before.
   But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment
grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on
Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised
downward.
   Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely
discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking
place, leaving the Federal Reserve in a position to hold off on any
further tightening of credit.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds rose by about $15 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields as low as 8.8 percent.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reinstates USA Antitrust Suit Against ARCO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USA Petroleum can sue the Atlantic
Richfield Co. for allegedly conspiring with retail service stations
to fix prices at below-market levels, a federal court ruled Friday.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court
ruling that dismissed USA's lawsuit because the independent
gasoline marketer failed to prove ``antitrust injury.''
   In its lawsuit, USA said more than a dozen large independent
gasoline companies have sold out, liquidated or drastically
curtailed operations and many independent retail stations have
closed as a result of Arco price-fixing that involved discontinuing
credit cards and offering lower gas prices.
   USA, a direct competitor of Arco at the retail level, also said
that it has suffered financial losses because of the price-fixing
and is being driven out of the market as a result.
   Arco contended USA's alleged harm was not an antitrust injury
because it resulted only from non-predatory, verticle price
competition.
   But the appeals court disagreed.
   ``In the present case, plaintiff's injuries result directly from
pricing practices that defendants admit (for the purpose of this
appeal) are forbidden by the antitrust laws and are therefore
illegal,'' the circuit court said in its 2-1 decision.
   The court rejected Arco's argument that USA's injuries resulted
from increased rather than decreased competition.
   ``The removal of some elements of price competition distorts the
markets and harms all the participants: those retailers which have
lost their ability to set prices, the other retailers in the same
market who are harmed by the distorted market, and the consumers,''
said the decision written by Judge Stephen Reinhardt.
   ``Even if we were to analyze the question at the more specific
level of maximum resale price fixing, given the longterm
consequences of that practice we would reach the same result for
similar reasons,'' the opinion said.
   Judge Arthur Alarcon dissented and said USA failed to show it
was hurt by antitrust practices.
   He said the essence of USA's claim is that ``one of the major
oil companies, Arco, intruded upon the independent retailers'
market niche by under-pricing the independent retailers. The result
is lower prices to consumers, but less profit for USA.''
   Alarcon concluded that the majority decision ``ignores the fact
that consumers are not injured by maximum vertical price-fixing,
and retail competitors are not injured and cannot complain about
minimum verticle price fixing.''

<HEAD>Chemical May Vanish From Dow Company Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical may be its middle name, but Dow
Chemical Co. is thinking of dropping the word to reflect the
increasing breadth of its business, a company official said Friday.
   A consultant and a small study group at Dow are reviewing the
idea, but have reached no conclusions, said Tom Henderson, manager
of public communications.
   Henderson said if there is a change, it will be to show that
Dow's business has expanded beyond basic chemicals to include
products as diverse as insulation and household goods, such as food
wrap and bathroom cleaner.
   The move would follow a trend of several years at Dow, said Mary
O'Neill, chemical industry analyst at Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Their strategy over the last seven years has been focused on
diversifying out of commodity chemicals,'' to help lure investors
wary of the cyclical nature of the basic chemical industry, O'Neill
said.
   ``They want to show that they are not cyclical, they're
diversified,'' she said.
   Dow sales comprise about 55 percent basic chemicals and 45
percent specialty goods such as its Styrofoam building insulation
and its household products, O'Neill said.
   Chemical is part of the name, but to describe the business,
Henderson said, ``The word doesn't do anybody much good these days.
We are trying to tell the public that we are more than just a
chemical company.''
   Henderson said no recommendations have been made to top
management. ``If we make a change it's going to be months and
months away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sears Fights Loss Of Market Share With Post Offices, `McKids'
Clothing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is fighting back from its
losses in the retail market with innovations ranging from in-store
post offices to ``McKids'' clothing, in hopes of catching up with
nimble specialty merchandisers.
   ``There are all sorts of things that are being offered to Middle
America that are exciting and fun and desirable, and so Sears is
trying to get in that ball game,'' Louis W. Stern, of Northwestern
University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management, said
Friday.
   ``I certainly see them trying to climb away from the
all-things-to-all-people retailing situation they've been in for a
long time,'' the marketing professor said.
   But Stern said he believes ``Sears is coming in too little, too
late. I do feel that they are in reasonably serious trouble.''
   ``As someone once said, it's very very difficult to turn a
battleship around in a stream,'' Stern said.
   Sears on Friday launched a test of post offices within stores at
10 Chicago-area sites and one in Wisconsin in a cooperative project
with the U.S. Postal Service.
   Sears also for the first time in its history has opened a
handful of in-store appliance and home electronics outlets known as
Brand Central, which offer brand-name goods along with Sears'
privshare,
from $81 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue increased to $785 million from $501
million.
   ``We have been growing at an extraordinary pace over the past
two years, due in large part to the widespread use of our
microprocessors in the personal computer market,'' Intel President
Andrew S. Grove said.
   In the first nine months of the year, net income jumped 141
percent _ to $367 million, or $2.05 a share, from $153 million, or
84 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the nine-month period rose to $2.1 billion from $1.3
billion.

<HEAD>Kroger Rejects KKR's Buyout Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kroger Co. on Friday rejected two buyout
proposals by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and reaffirmed its
intent to go ahead with a $4.6 billion corporate restructuring plan.
   The realignment prompted the firing of 300 headquarters
employees announced Thursday.
   The supermarket giant said its board of directors unanimously
rejected both of the latest unsolicited proposals made by the New
York City-based Kohlberg Kravis in an Oct. 4 letter to Kroger.
   In New York, spokeswoman Ruth Pachman said Kohlberg Kravis had
no comment on Kroger's response.
   Kohlberg's more lucrative buyout offer of $5.03 billion, or
$64-per-share, represented a sweetened offer from a
$58.50-per-share pitch KKR made after entering the bidding last
month.
   Dart Group Inc., of Landover, Md., started the bidding Sept. 19
with a $4.32 billion, $55-per-share offer. Dart has not made
another buyout offer.
   Kroger chairman Lyle Everingham said the board again decided
that Kroger's restructuring is preferable to selling the company
because it gives shareholders immediate cash dividends along with
equity in a continuing company, although it would be smaller and
more highly leveraged. As envisioned, the restructuring would leave
Kroger independent and publicly owned.
   ``Our program will permit shareholders to realize substantial
immediate values on their common stock, while retaining the
controlling equity interest in a company with a bright future,''
Everingham said.
   Kroger shareholders have filed at least four lawsuits
challenging management's decision not to sell Kroger.
   Kohlberg Kravis' latest proposals included the $5.03 billion
buyout offer and a separate proposal to buy Kroger even after it
completes the restructuring. Kroger has said its restructuring
would require the layoffs announced Thursday and selling some real
estate, supermarkets and convenience stores, as well as
distribution and food-processing centers.
   ``Kroger's board concluded that both these latest KKR proposals
were inadequate and not in the best interests of the company, its
shareholders and other constituents,'' Kroger said in a statement.
``In making its determination, Kroger's board considered various
factors, including the opinion of the company's financial adviser,
Goldman Sachs & Co., that both KKR proposals are inadequate.''
   The Kroger board said it also was concerned about possible
regulatory antitrust problems and whether Kohlberg Kravis could
obtain the necessary financing. Kohlberg Kravis owns other food
retailing companies, including Stop & Shop Cos., Safeway Stores and
Beatrice Cos.
   Kroger said Thursday's mass firing, which gives employees up to
nine months' salary and other benefits for up to a year, will save
the company at least $13 million annually. The firing does not
affect supermarket employees.
   Some analysts say Kroger's staff reductions which leave 500
employees at it headquarters, still isn't likely to discourage
takeover-minded outsiders.
   ``This is throwing bleeding hunks of meat over the bow of the
boat, hoping the shark will slow down,'' said Ryan Mathews, senior
associate editor of Grocery Marketing, a trade publication. ``The
shark wants a whole dinner, not just an appetizer.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Price Plunge Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged for the second consecutive day
Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by a lack of export
business, expectations of higher government crop estimates and good
harvesting weather.
   In other markets, wheat prices rallied, corn prices dipped,
cocoa prices surged, oil prices advanced, gold declined, silver
prices were higher, cattle and hog prices were mixed, and frozen
pork bellies were sharply lower,
   Anticipation that updated U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates to be released next Wednesday will show higher soybean
harvest yields helped trigger the sell-off in beans, said analyst
Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   The November contract fell 22} cents and settled at $7.90 a
bushel, the lowest level since late July.
   The negative sentiment spilled over into the corn pit, sparking
a selling wave that kept prices down, analysts said. Wheat prices
rallied on ongoing expectations that China and the Soviet Union
plan big purchases,
   Good harvesting weather forecast for the weekend also added a
negative tone to corn and soybean prices, analysts said.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 1} cents higher, with December at
$4.34{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 cents lower, with December at
$2.94\ a bushel; oats were { cent to 3{ cents lower, with December
at $2.44\ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cents to 22} cents lower,
with November at $7.90 a bushel.
   Cocoa prices advanced at the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in
New York on the Ivory Coast's announcement that it will not cut the
price it pays cocoa farmers.
   The news Thursday from the world's largest cocoa producer
indicates that the Ivory Coast likely will try to ``keep prices
very highly valued into the season,'' said analyst Sandra Kaul of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Cocoa prices settled $18 to $39 higher, with the contract for
delivery in December at $1,278 a ton.
   The rally in oil prices after a week-long slide was due mostly
to technical factors, as traders squared their positions before the
weekend, analysts said.
   But overproduction, which has sparked strong declines in recent
days, remained the underlying influence on the market, they said.
   Crude oil was 25 cents to 28 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in November at $12.94 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent
to .57 cent higher, with November at 37.46 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .21 cent to .80 cent higher, with November at 40.13
cents a gallon.
   Trading was quiet in the gold and silver pits at the New York
Commodity Exchange, where stronger oil prices and a softer U.S.
dollar encouraged some buying. But gains were offset by strong
treasury bond prices, analysts said.
   Gold prices settled 60 cents to $1.80 lower, with the October
contract at $403.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 3.7 cents
higher, with October at $6.325 a troy ounce.
   Light boxed-beef sales kept the lid on live cattle prices at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cheaper corn prices buoyed
feeder cattle prices, said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Pork belly prices were down on mostly technical factors, and the
negative sentiment spilled over into the hog pit, he said.
   Live cattled settled .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in October at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .20 cent to .55 cent higher, with October at 82.30
cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent lower to .43 cent higher,
with October at 40.45 cents a pound; and pork bellies were 1.35
cents to 1.70 cents lower, with February at 47.52 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls On U.S. Unemployment Report; Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed narrowly lower Friday after it
skidded and then regained some ground in response to the Labor
Department's release of September unemployment figures.
   Gold prices were little changed. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a late bid of $403.30 for a troy ounce of gold, down 20
cents from late Thursday's $403.50.
   Analysts said the dollar fell after the government report, which
included news that the nation's non-farm payroll grew by 255,000
jobs last month. The Labor Department said the unemployment rate
fell 0.2 percent to 5.4 percent.
   Foreign exchange traders had expected a payroll increase of
about 300,000, so the Labor Department's numbers came as a
disappointment.
   Investors interpreted the payroll figures as a sign of weakness
in the economy. But after further consideration, they ``realized
the economy is growing steadily,'' said Peter Frick, foreign
exchange economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
   In addition, dollar traders seeing the stock and bond markets
improve on the unemployment data were heartened by the demand for
U.S. investments, said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with Harris
Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   As a result, the dollar regained some of the ground it lost
earlier.
   Dealers expected Monday's Columbus Day bank holiday in New York
and a holiday in Japan to produce quiet trading early next week.
The dollar faces another test next Thursday, when the Commerce
Department issues its report on the nation's trade deficit for
August.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended before the unemployment report
came out, the dollar edged up to 133.50 Japanese yen Friday from
133.30 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at
133.55 yen, and in New York, it slipped to 133.37 yen from late
Thursday's 133.645 yen.
   In London, the dollar slipped against the British pound. It cost
$1.6985 to buy one pound, more costly than $1.6935 late Thursday.
Sterling also gained in New York, where it was quoted at $1.69795,
compared with late Thursday's $1.6927.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.86285 West German marks, down from
1.86585; 1.58115 Swiss francs, down from 1.5847; 6.3460 French
francs, down from 6.3570; 1,388.50 Italian lire, down from
1,391.75; and 1.20845 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20995.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8608 West German marks, down from 1.8641; 1.5795
Swiss francs, down from 1.5830; 6.3420 French francs, down from
6.3475; 2.0988 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1000; 1,387.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,388.75; and 1.2116 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold prices went nowhere in what a Zurich bullion dealer termed
a ``non-day and a non-event.'' Investor demand for gold remains
low, with fund and portfolio managers spurning it, dealers said.
   Gold edged lower in London to a late bid price of $403.05 a troy
ounce, compared with late Thursday's $403.35.
   In Zurich, gold inched higher, closing at a bid $404.25 compared
with $403.90 late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 49
cents to close at a bid $406.22.
   Gold also marked time in New York trading, where it slipped to
$403.20 on the Commodity Exchange from late Thursday's $403.80.
   Silver bullion prices dipped on the London market where the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.33 a troy ounce,
compared with Thursday's $6.34. However, silver rose on the
Commodity Exchange in New York to $6.325 from late Thursday's
$6.888.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Up Sharply in August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out consumer credit at an
annual rate of 10.1 percent in August, up substantially from the
July borrowing pace, the government reported Friday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumers took out $5.44 billion more
in credit than they paid off in August, as auto loans and credit
card debt grew more rapidly.
   Consumer debt had risen $3.62 billion in July, a 6.7 percent
annual rate, as the pace of borrowing slowed momentarily following
several months of rapid gains.
   In August, auto loans grew by $2.29 billion, a 9.7 percent rate
of increase, following a 4.7 percent pace in July.
   Michael Penzer, an economist with Bank of America in San
Francisco, said the August increase was somewhat higher than many
economists had been looking for and in part represented a reaction
to the sluggish July increase.
   Penzer noted that consumer debt has risen by 9 percent in the
last 12 months while personal incomes have gone up by 7.5 percent
annual rate, indicating that Americans were still willing to take
debt at a faster pace than their incomes were rising.
   ``Even though a lot of private economists are looking for
consumers to moderate their spending, this report doesn't suggest
they are doing that,'' he said. ``Anybody looking for a slowdown in
the economy in the second half of the year won't find it in these
numbers.''
   The Federal Reserve began a series of credit-tightening steps in
late March in an effort to dampen demand and cool off inflationary
pressures. Many analysts believe the central bank will resume
pushing interest rates higher after the Nov. 8 election.
   The category that includes credit card debt rose by $2.62
billion in August, a hefty 18 percent annual rate of gain,
following a sizable $2.12 billion rise in July.
   Together, the gains in auto and credit card debt accounted for
90 percent of the overall rise in consumer borrowing.
   The category that includes bank and credit union loans not
secured by real estate rose by $498 million, a 3.6 percent rate of
increase, while loans for mobile homes rose $30 million, a 1.4
percent annual rate.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at $653.43 billion,
up 9.2 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise on Job Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices surged Friday, bolstered by a
government report showing a smaller-than-expected rise in payroll
employment in September.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped about 1 11-16
points, or $16.87 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from price and is an indicator of
interest rate trends, tumbled to 8.79 percent from 8.94 percent
late Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported that the September unemployment
rate fell 0.2 percentage point to 5.4 percent. But the bond market
was more intent on a companion report that said payrolls grew by
255,000 jobs, slightly below the 300,000 that many analysts had
expected.
   The figures were considered fresh evidence of moderation in the
economy.
   ``Basically, they were good for the market,'' said Kevin
Flanagan, a money-market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He said the report touched off a buying wave that was ``sort of
like a snowball effect.''
   Steven A. Wood, money-market economist for BankAmerica Capital
Markets Group, said the data provided ``further evidence that the
economy is slowing down from the robust pace of expansion in the
first half of the year.''
   Payroll employment had been growing at a pace of about 340,000 a
month in the first six months of the year, but that has slowed to
an average of just over 200,000 in each of the past three months.
   A slower economy means credit demands may abate somewhat, easing
upward pressure on interest rates. It also would reduce
inflationary pressures, which erode bond values.
   In the secondary market, prices of short-term Treasury issues
rose to between 9-32 point and 9-16 point, intermediate maturities
advanced between 11-16 point and a full point, and 20-year issues
gained 1 3-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton composite Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, jumped 7.92 to 1,155.53.
   In corporate trading, prices also advanced. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 2.28
to 295.54.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, declined to
7.51 percent and the discount slipped 3 basis points to 7.28
percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.83 percent and the
discount fell 8 basis points to 7.44 percent. Yields on one-year
bills dropped to 8.00 percent and the discount tumbled 12 basis
points to 7.46 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8
5-16 percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   An outboard-motor manufacturer has agreed to
finance a $20 million cleanup of PCBs in Lake Michigan's Waukegan
Harbor, effectively ending years of bitter haggling over the
Superfund site, state and federal officials announced Friday.
   Under a consent decree signed by Outboard Marine Corp. and
federal and state officials, thousands of pounds of toxic
polychlorinated biphenyls will be removed, treated and safely
stored, Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan said.
   ``This is a major environmental victory,'' Hartigan said, noting
that no taxpayer dollars will be used in the clean-up. ``I think
it's a sensational day.''
   Waukegan Harbor, an important Great Lakes port at Waukegan, 25
miles north of Chicago, has been listed on the federal Superfund
list of environmental hazards and at one time was considered
Illinois' worst pollution problem.
   Public health officials have advised against eating fish from
the harbor. PCBs have been shown to cause tumors in laboratory
animals and are suspected to cause cancer in humans.
   ``We obviously believe that it's time to get this matter
resolved,'' said company spokesman Laurin Baker in a telephone
interview from OMC's Waukegan headquarters.
   While acknowledging it is ``hard to be happy over spending $20
million in company assets,'' he said the decree ``is the best
settlement possible.''
   Contamination of the harbor began in 1961, when hydraulic fluid
containing PCBs leaked from the hydraulic systems at the company's
Waukegan plant into waste waters, which were dumped into Lake
Michigan and onto Outboard Marine property.
   The case became entangled in the legal system as company
officials first argued PCBs posed no threat to humans, then barred
from their facilities federal environmental officials seeking to
determine how bad the pollution was, said U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency spokesman John Perrecone.
   After 1986 changes in federal Superfund law allowed the EPA such
access, the company agreed to negotiate with state and federal
authorities, Perrecone said.
   Under terms of Friday's consent decree, Outboard Marine will
begin cleaning up the PCBs next spring and should complete the task
by 1992. The company will remove and treat contaminated material
from both the harbor and its property.
   ``The agreement called for us to remove and treat sediments and
soils that have the highest levels of contamination and encapsulate
the remaining low-level soils and sediments in three areas,'' Baker
said.
   Outboard Marine is a $1.3 billion manufacturer of recreational
marine products and other recreational materials.

   A European consortium of 10 airlines said Friday
it had given International Business Machines Corp. one of the
company's biggest European orders ever, involving four new
mainframe computers and upgrades of two others.
   The value of the order was not given, but was believed to be in
the tens of millions of dollars. A single one of the 3090 Model
280S mainframe computers included in the order has a list price of
$5.4 million.
   The Galileo Data Centre in Swindon, England, will be one of the
largest in Europe and will handle transactions such as ticket and
car rental reservations.
   Galileo said IBM would supply four of its 3090 Model 280S
mainframe computers and upgrade two other machines to the same
power. It will also supply a ``large number'' of workstations based
on IBM's Personal System-2 personal computer.

<HEAD>Arco, State Settle Bulk of Issues in Tax Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arco paid the state nearly $172.3 million
Friday to settle most of the legal battle over the amount the oil
company owes in state income taxes for 1978 through 1981, the state
Revenue Department announced.
   Los Angeles-based Arco and the department resolved 14 major
issues in the case, department spokesman Royce Weller said in a
news release.
   The issues involve the amount of taxable income from the
production of oil and natural gas from Prudhoe Bay and Cook Inlet,
allowable tax deductions for exploration, development and operation
of the oil and gas fields, and disagreement over the company's
pipeline income, Weller said.
   Arco and the state agreed to pursue litigation of two remaining
issues involving a potential tax liability of $57.3 million, Weller
said.
   Those issues involve the amount of interest the company can
deduct in computing taxable income as an owner of the TransAlaska
Pipeline System, and a dispute over how federal entitlement
regulations are to be applied under the state's oil and gas
corporate income tax, Weller said.
   Arco's 1988 profits will not be affected by the settlement
because the company's financial reserves are sufficient to cover
the issues in dispute, the news release said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper was briefed on terms of the settlement and
approved it, Weller said.
   William E. Wade Jr., president of Arco Alaska Inc., said the
settlement avoided a costly and protracted legal fight.
   ``The agreement reached with the state of Alaska is a reasonable
resolution of complex and difficult issues,'' Wade said.
   Alaska Attorney General Grace Berg Schaible said the state
decided to pursue litigation on the other issues because they
involve legal precedents that will affect the entire petroleum
industry.
   ``To the extent the remaining litigation falls in the test-case
category, this settlement today marks the end of a long tax
dispute,'' she said. ``This settlement reflects a reasonble
assessment of what we would have recovered and serves the best
interests of the state.''
   State Revenue Commissioner Hugh Malone termed the settlement
``just and fair.''

   Stock prices rose sharply Friday to some of
their highest levels since last year's crash, inspired by news of
smaller-than-expected employment growth last month.
   The pace of trading picked up as the market climbed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 42.50 points to
2,150.25, falling just short of the 1988 closing high of 2,158.61
it reached on July 5.
   For the week, the average rose 37.34 points.
   Some other, broader measures of market trends surpassed their
July peaks _ for example, the New York Stock Exchange's composite
index of all its listed common stocks, which was up 2.88 at 156.81.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,140 up, 399 down and 420 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 216.35 million
shares, against 153.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 248.31 million shares.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent in September from 5.6
percent the month before.
   But at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment
grew by 255,000 jobs, a bit less than the consensus estimate on
Wall Street. The employment growth figure for August was revised
downward.
   Wall Street took the news as an indication that a widely
discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking

further tightening of credit.
   ``These data are not unambiguously strong or weak, and do not

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar, who
was told by the Justice Department he illegally sentenced a
Pepsi-Cola bottling company to prison for price fixing, refused
Friday to reconsider his sentence.
   In a six-page opinion, Doumar said he derived his sentence
against Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. ``from the basic
principle that, to the extent possible, the law treats all persons
_ whether natural or corporate _ equally.
   ``Any other treatment would belie that basic principle and
create a special class of persons which this Court is unwilling to
foster,'' he wrote.
   In a Sept. 30 letter, the Justice Department asked Doumar to
reconsider his novel sentence because prosecutors would be unable
to defend the sentence on appeal.
   Last month, Doumar sentenced Allegheny to three years in prison
and fined the company $1 million for fixing its soft drink prices
in collusion with Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co. The scheme
cost customers in Norfolk, Richmond and Baltimore more than $10
million.
   Doumar warned attorneys and executives of the Pepsi bottler that
the corporation was treated as an individual under the law, and he
would not hesitate to have federal marshals shut down the plant.
   He then suspended the sentence and $50,000 of the fine on the
condition that the company provide four high-ranking executives to
perform one year each of full-time, free community service in each
of the three cities victimized.
   Doumar said a $1 million fine, the maximum penalty for antitrust
violations, was no deterrent since the scheme netted the company
more than $10 million. ``It's just considered a cost of doing
business,'' he said.
   David C. Jordan, a Justice Department attorney who prosecuted
the case, agreed with Doumar's reasoning, but said in his letter
the Sherman antitrust law allows only the imprisonment of
executives, not corporations.
   ``We are not persuaded that Congress intended to authorize
courts to imprison corporations,'' Jordan wrote. ``Indeed,
imprisoning a corporation by having a marshal seize its assets or
otherwise limit its operations could adversely affect competition
and further injure consumers.''
   In response, Doumar said, ``this Court cannot ascribe to
Congress an intent to incur the costs asociated with effectively
enforcing the Sherman Act when violated by individuals but not when
violated by corporations.''
   When told of Doumar's opinion, James H. Walsh, defense attorney
for Alleghany, said he would proceed with his appeal to the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and use the Justice Department letter
to bolster his case.
   ``I certainly would hope that the letter is beneficial,'' he
said.
   Mid-Atlantic and Allegheny conspired to set prices from 1982 to
1984. Wholesale prices were inflated 25 percent and the cost was
passed on to consumers, according to court records.
   Mid-Atlantic pleaded guilty to the charge and paid fines of $1
million in both Richmond and Washington, D.C. Six top officials of
the two companies received fines and prison terms.
   The Justice Department has said 14 grand juries in 12 states are
continuing their investigation of price fixing in the soft drink
industry.

<HEAD>Shippers Say Drought Pulled Plug On Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KOLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freight companies hauling iron ore, coal and
other heavy cargo through the Great Lakes say the summer drought
pulled the plug on their shipping season by lowering water levels.
   But a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official said Friday the
firms shouldn't blame the hot weather for failing to keep up with
heavy demands.
   The Cleveland-based Lake Carriers' Association will ask the
corps to give them an extra month to haul cargo through locks at
Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   The four locks _ which link Lake Superior to Lake Michigan and
the industry-lined St. Lawrence Seaway _ normally close from Dec.
15 until April 1, when ice clogs the lakes.
   Shipping giants such as American Steamship Co. say evaporation
from the drought lowered water levels, forcing ships to lighten
their cargoes. They want to use the Sault Ste. Marie locks until at
least Jan. 15, Lake Carriers' Association spokesman Glen Nekvasil
said Friday.
   The extension would give American Steamship and the group's 13
other shipping firms time to make extra trips and catch up with an
increasing demand for raw materials, Nekvasil said.
   ``Fleets have been hard pressed to meet current demand,'' he
said, adding that increased steel production has boosted 1988
shipments by more than 13 percent.
   Freight companies may need more time to keep pace with
shipments, but they shouldn't blame the drought for their problems,
corps spokesman Donald Billmaier said.
   ``I don't think they hurt much from the drought. I just think
they've got more business,'' said Billmaier, chief of operations
and maintenance for the corps' Detroit district.
   Billmaier confirmed that water levels have dropped over the past
year, but said shipping companies compensated earlier by hauling
heavier loads when the water was deeper.
   ``They can't haul loads as big as they could two years ago,
that's true,'' he said. ``Maybe they can't make as much money. But
they can still work the lakes.''
   Billmaier said the corps, which controls the Upper Peninsula
locks, also restricts winter shipping in an effort to minimize
environmental damage.
   Ships maneuvering through ice jams cause extra water turbulence
that kills fish, damages docks and shoreline and disturbs the
bottom of the Great Lakes, he said.
   Billmaier said the corps' Chicago bureau probably will agree to
extend the shipping season by at least two weeks if carriers can
prove they need the extra time. He could not predict when a final
ruling will be made.

   MCorp, Texas' second-largest bank-holding company
and the last of the state's major banks to avoid seeking outside
help, said Friday it is seeking a federal bailout in its proposed
recapitalization.
   The bank said it could not predict when or how much aid it would
request.
   ``At this time it is not possible to determine the ultimate
likelihood, amount, nature or timing of any FDIC (Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.) assistance for any recapitalization, nor is it
possible to predict the impact of the transaction on MCorp's
stockholders and creditors,'' the bank said in a statement
attributed to Gene H. Bishop, chairman and chief executive officer,
and John T. Cater, president and chief operating officer.
   Steve Katsanos, a spokesman for the FDIC in Washington, said the
agency would not have any comment on the matter.
   ``Our standard practice is that we don't comment on requests for
assistance,'' he said.
   The bank's third-quarter results, due out by Tuesday, are
expected to show a bigger jump in non-performing assets than the
$158 million increase posted in the second quarter, according to a
report in the Wall Street Journal.
   MCorp also said it expects to have a net loss of $525 million
for the third period, compared with a net loss of $73.7 million in
the year-ago quarter. The company said it expects to record a
provision for possible loan losses of about $370 million, making
its allowance for bad loans approximately $690 million.
   MCorp's stock had dropped a half dollar to hit a new low of 75
cents a share Tuesday, but bounced back to $1.12{ on Wednesday and
Thursday. Friday's announcement pushed it down to 87{ cents.
   The request to be filed with the FDIC will suggest that MCorp
raise new capital from private investors, including current
stockholders, to accompany the FDIC assistance, the statement said.
   ``MCorp continues to maintain adequate funding to meet the needs
of its customers even though the recent economic challenges in our
region have put enormous pressures on our situation,'' Bishop said.
``We believe that an early resolution by the FDIC of our assistance
proposal will be the most cost-effective alternative for the FDIC.''
   MCorp has 26 banks and 86 banking offices throughout the state.
The company had assets of $20.1 billion as of June 30. Total
deposits were $16.1 billion and total loans were $12.2 billion _ 36
percent of that in real estate loans.
   It was the only major Texas bank not to have resorted to a
federal bailout or purchase by an out-of-state banking company.
   Earlier this year, Dallas-based First RepublicBank Corp., the
state's largest bank-holding company, sought federal assistance and
ultimately was acquired by NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
Houston-based First City Bancorporation of Texas was rescued by the
FDIC and Chicago banker A. Robert Abboud.
   A federal review of MCorp's loan portfolio is expected to be
made public soon. Observers have been saying the review by U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency examiners will force MCorp to
significantly increase reserves for loan losses in the third
quarter.
   J. Michael Shepherd, a senior deputy comptroller, said the
report is complete, but he has declined to elaborate on its
findings.
   The Journal reported that the government's examination
discovered worse-than-expected weakness in MCorp's loan portfolio.
   Quoting unidentified regulators and officials close to the
company, the Journal said the review apparently had turned up more
shaky real estate and commercial loans.
   MCorp's third-quarter financial results are expected to show a
bigger jump in non-performing assets than the $158 million increase
it posted in the second quarter, the newspaper said.
   MCorp was formed in October 1984 by the merger of Mercantile
Texas Corp. of Dallas and Southwest Bancshares Inc. of Houston.
MCorp had 69 member banks and total assets of $20 billion.
   Since its formation, it raised $247 million of private capital
in 1985, has raised $653 million in cash and securities through the
sale of its MNet and MTech subsidiaries, and has cut costs.
   MCorp ranked 35th among the nation's largest banking
organizations in terms of total assets on June 30.

   Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it
earned $7.1 million in the third quarter in contrast to a loss of
$70 million in the same period a year earlier.
   However, results were not as strong as in this year's second
quarter, when the company made $26.1 million.
   Revenue in the third quarter was $285.5 million, up from $261
million a year earlier but down from $308 million in this year's
second quarter.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer W.J. Sanders III blamed the
decline from the spring figures on a drop in orders for
microprocessors from personal computer manufacturers. He predicted
a continued slump.
   ``We believe that a period of digestion of component inventories
on the part of our customers will keep a lid on new orders and
hence our sales growth for the next several quarters,'' Sanders
continued.
   AMD announced it will continue with plans to close its oldest
operating silicon wafer factory in December and reduce its
workforce in Malaysia and the Philippines by 1,400. The company
said it plans to take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings as a
result of those plans.
   Sanders said he remains ``very positive'' on the longer-term
prospects of AMD's future.

   Technical market problems incited the panic last
October on Wall Street, not nervousness about the economy, the head
of the New York Stock Exchange said in defending proposed trading
halts to escape another crisis.
   In a Friday interview with reporters to assess what has happened
since the crisis nearly a year ago, John Phelan conceded the
``circuit breakers'' proposal for coordinated trading halts with
other exchanges is an artificial restraint on the free-trading
system, which he dislikes in theory.
   ``I think all of us in general don't like to shut markets down
because it ruins liquidity,'' the chairman of the biggest U.S.
securities market said. ``But there are a few points in time when
you need to shut it down.''
   The NYSE and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange jointly proposed
the circuit breaker plan in July. The proposal, under review by
federal regulatory agencies and contingent on approval by other
exchanges, calls for a one-year test in which predetermined price
drops would trigger temporary trading halts.
   NYSE trading would stop for an hour if the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 250 points, and for two hours if the average fell an
additional 150 points the same day.
   At the Chicago exchange, the nation's largest futures market,
trading would stop for an hour if the Standard & Poor's 500 stock
index futures contract fell 30 points and for two hours if it fell
a further 20 points the same day. The New York and Chicago markets
would coordinate the exact timing of the halts.
   It was frantic selling of large amounts of stock in New York,
coupled with plunging stock-index futures in Chicago, that were
scrutinized as important catalysts in the Oct. 19-20 panic.
   Lack of coordination between the two trading centers increased
the panic because investors had no idea what prices should be. This
market alienation was singled out as an important weakness by
government investigations.
   In the months since, Phelan said, it has become clear that the
crash was caused by ``technical reasons within the market, and not
because of fundamental shifts in the economy.''
   While he said the chances of a similar rout seemed more remote
now, ``at some point in time we'll go off through a fundamental
shift in the economy and so then, if it (the Dow average) does go
down 250 points, there's no guarantee that it's not going to go
down another 500 points.''
   Under the circuit-breaker remedy, he said, ``if you take it down
in steps, so that everybody knows what it's doing, you're probably
better socially and politically to do it that way than to just let
it go through its extremes and then find its equilibrium.''
   Critics of the circuit-breaker strategy say it could drive
investors overseas to less restrictive markets. Moreover, they say,
it could hasten a market panic if investors decide to sell their
stocks at the same time, hoping to get out of the market before a
trading halt takes effect.
   Phelan and other defenders of the proposal argue that such halts
can have a calming effect on the market, giving everybody an
opportunity to think rationally rather than sell in a blind panic.
   ``Anyway I think it's worth a try,'' Phelan said. ``Hopefully
you don't have to use it very much.''

   The latest government report on the unemployment picture has
drawn raves on Wall Street.
   The nation's jobless rate fell to 5.4 percent in September,
nearing its lowest point since the early 1970s. But that wasn't the
good news for investors.
   Rather, stockholders and bondholders were encouraged that
details of th report indicated the economy and employment are
growing more slowly than expected. Too-strong growth raises fears
of inflation.
   The jobless rate's decline from 5.6 percent in August left it at
the same level as July and only one tick above the 14-year-low of
5.3 percent in June, when many people feared the economy was
growing too quickly.
   However, there were other signs that the economy's growth was
not so fast. The total number of factory jobs was down by 37,000.
Out of the total of 255,000 new jobs overall, more than 100,000
were teachers returning to the classroom.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 42.50 points to
2,150.25 on Friday, falling only a few points short of the 1988
closing high of 2,158.61 it reached on July 5.
   ``If you were (Republican nominee) George Bush, I don't think
you could have written a better set of numbers,'' said David Wyss,
chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass.
   The jobless report also helped the bond market Friday, which is
highly sensitive to inflation. The Treasury's closely watched
30-year bond jumped about 1 11-16 points, or $16.87 for every
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from price and is an indicator of interest rate trends,
tumbled to 8.79 percent from 8.94 percent late Thursday.
   The dollar finished the day slightly lower.
   Steven A. Wood, money-market economist for BankAmerica Capital
Markets Group, said the data provided ``further evidence that the
economy is slowing down from the robust pace of expansion in the
first half of the year.''
   In another report Friday, the nation's business leaders,
enjoying high profits from the strongest economic growth in four
years, predicted a slowdown in 1989.
   Executives ranging from Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed to
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith said their industries
are generating very strong earnings.
   Nevertheless, members of the Business Council, composed of 62
chief executives of large U.S. corporations, said they would prefer
less robust growth and a ``soft landing'' next year to the
alternative: higher inflation, rising interest rates and finally a
recession, or a ``hard landing.''
   One reason for the drop in the jobless rate is that there were
fewer people in the labor force, said Mishel, an economist of the
Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank financed largely by
labor unions.
   ``The whole reason why Reagan has been able to achieve low
unemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a third
in the 1980s,'' Mishel said.
   ``President Carter had the Baby Boom coming into the labor
market and had to create a lot more jobs. Reagan has enjoyed the
effects of the Baby Bust.''

   Oil futures prices have risen in what analysts
said was a technical rally inspired by the expiration of November
options and efforts to square trading positions before the weekend.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate rose 28 cents Friday to settle at $12.94 a
barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.63 cent to settle
at 40.13 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.22 cent to
37.46 cents a gallon.
   Prices moved erratically in a narrow range during the day, said
William Byers of the oil futures research department at Bear,
Stearns & Co.
   But he said short-covering, in which traders who have sold
borrowed contracts buy contracts to square their positions, drove
prices higher.
   Richard Redoglia, vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said there was also some buying connected with the
expiration of November options.
   ``The pressure on the market is still there. Overproduction is
still there,'' he said.
   Earlier in the week, crude oil prices tumbled below $13 a barrel
to their lowest level in two years as Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest oil exporter, threatened to produce more than its quota if
other members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries continued to pump beyond their quotas.
   The Saudis have indicated they want to punish other OPEC members
for overproducing and driving down the price of oil.
