   Police warned Wednesday that jail sentences
may await opportunists who made off with more than $700,000 after
an armored car accidentally dumped a crateful of cash in the
street, sparking a mad scramble for the loot.
   Three to five people who were driving or walking by when the
truck dropped a reported $771,000 in an industrial area Tuesday
scooped up clear plastic bags full of cash and sped off. Only
$40,100 was recovered, police said.
   ``We've only had one honest man so far,'' said Lt. Barry
Johnson. A TV repairman picked up two bags containing $20,050 each
and took them straight to the nearby offices of Loomis Armored Inc.
   Late Wednesday, a woman identified only as a 30-year-old postal
worker turned gave police two clear plastic bags containing a total
of $28,000.
   ``She said she picked up the money and then got kind of scared,
so she decided to turn it in,'' said Sgt. William Herndon.
   Investigators were tracing license plate numbers and vehicle
descriptions reported by witnesses and trying to compile a list of
the lost bills' serial numbers.
   ``If they turn it in, the company is considering a reward,''
said Johnson. ``The alternative is we trace them down and they go
to jail. It's their choice.''
   The opportunistic motorists or pedestrians could face felony
charges of grand theft if they took $500 or more, police said.
   A spokesman for Oakland-based Loomis declined to comment on the
accident, which occurred at 3:40 p.m. on a busy thoroughfare in the
Potrero District, adjacent to the low-income Hunter's Point
neighborhood that has been plagued by rock-throwing and violence
against city buses this year.
   The armored truck, filled with more than $1.7 million collected
from 20 banks in the San Francisco Bay area, was headed for Loomis'
offices from downtown.
   Johnson said the driver claimed the rear door had been locked,
but the dolly containing a crate of bills slammed against it and
somehow forced it open.
   The driver, whose name was not disclosed, did not learn of the
mishap until a honking motorist pointed it out 2{ blocks away.
   Before the driver could return, a crowd gathered around the
fallen bags. Some people put the money back into the crate and
others hung onto it, including one man who tossed numerous bags
into his pickup truck and drove off despite the urgings of
bystanders.
   ``It was a free-for-all,'' police Officer Harry Soulette, who
was at the scene, told the San Francisco Examiner. ``People were
throwing bags of bills into their cars and taking off. It was
wild.''
   Police declined to be specific Wednesday about the amount
involved, saying only that it was more than $500,000. The Examiner
reported that $771,000 in $10, $20 and $50 bills fell out of the
truck while close to $1 million remained inside.
   The money is ``potentially traceable,'' Johnson said.
   Police said the driver was not a suspect.
   ``We're looking at every possibility, but there doesn't appear
to have been any collusion at this point,'' Johnson said.
   Repairman Luis Lopez who had spent the day working on TV
monitors at Loomis' offices, told police he tried to recover more
money for the company but was was told by the loot-grabbers to mind
his own business.
   The 29-year-old Lopez, who lives in Daly City, does not have a
listed telephone number and could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
   Soulette was impressed with his honesty.
   ``He was one of a few people who tried to do what was right,''
the officer said. ``While everyone else was busy grabbing what they
could get, he was thinking of getting the money back to its
rightful owner.''

<HEAD>Panel To Ask Supreme Court to Find Former Assistant Judge in
Contempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judicial conduct board said it will seek a
contempt citation against a former judge for refusing to answer
questions Wednesday at a hearing on misconduct charges against a
former state Supreme Court justice.
   Jane Wheel, a former Chittenden County assistant judge, cited
her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to
answer questions during the Judicial Conduct Board hearing on
former Justice William Hill.
   Hill was one of three Supreme Court members charged with
misconduct in January 1987. One of the three died; the case against
the third was dropped.
   Hill, who has since retired from the high court, is accused of
improperly using his judicial clout to assist Wheel, 55.
   Wheel's refusal to answer questions prompted the hearing panel
to direct its lawyer to petition the Supreme Court to find Wheel in
contempt. She could face jail.
   ``I don't think we're risking contempt,'' said Wheel's lawyer
Richard Davis. ``If asserting one's right to refuse to testify
under the Fifth Amendment presents a risk in this country then we
better start with a new system.''
   Wheel was found guilty in state court last month on charges of
lying under oath during an inquiry into allegations she submitted
false pay vouchers. The case is under appeal.
   The board had ruled that Wheel may invoke the Fifth Amendment on
questions relating directly to the criminal charges. But panel
chairman Harvey Otterman said that protection does not extend to
questions that are merely embarrassing.
   Wheel gave her name, address and length of service but balked
when prosecutor William Donahue asked about her relationship with
Hill.
   Prosecutors allege Hill allowed his friendship with Wheel to
interfere with his judicial duties. Assistant judges are commonly
lay people; they handle civil cases. Hill was a teacher before she
was elected.
   Hill has said his relationship with Wheel was a proper
professional one. But Margaret Maskell, a courthouse employee,
testified Tuesday that she once found Wheel with her arms around
Hill's neck in his chambers.
   The hearing panel is composed of three of seven members of the
Judicial Conduct Board; the three hearing the case will make
recommendations to the full board.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega canceled truce
talks with rebels Tuesday after the insurgents said they would not
attend a planned meeting in southern Nicaragua.
   Ortega accused both President Reagan and the rebels, known as
Contras, of sabotaging the talks.
   ``This signifies the killing of the possibility of a meeting,''
he said on Voice of Nicaragua radio, but suggested new talks no
later than the third week in March.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said earlier Tuesday the
U.S.-supported rebels would not attend the meeting scheduled by the
leftist Sandinistas.
   ``The Sandinista government spoke with the Nicaraguan Resistance
at the last minute (Monday), informing us that they were ready for
the meeting in Sapoa,'' Calero said in a telephone interview from
Miami. ``We are not willing to take part in a unilateral meeting
mounted by the Sandinistas.''
   Ortega said Reagan ``made a virulent speech against Nicaragua
yesterday. He said `No' to the meeting.
   ``So if there is anyone responsible for the meeting not being
held tomorrow and for the the blood that continues being shed ...
it is the president of the United States.''
   Reagan said in Washington Monday that congressional opponents of
further aid to the Contras lacked the courage to fight communism
and the defeat of the rebels would be a ``grave strategic defeat
for the United States.''
   Three days of talks had been scheduled at Sapoa, 90 miles south
of Managua on the border with Costa Rica.
   They would have been the first talks held on Nicaraguan
territory and without a mediator. Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo mediated previous talks.
   A Contra statement issued in Miami said the rebels wanted
preliminary discussions in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   ``We accept to go to Sapoa but we are asking a previous meeting
to clear up the details,'' said Aristides Sanchez, one of five
Contra directors. ``We have to discuss dates, an agenda, security.
It must all be established beforehand, since there is no longer a
mediator.''
   He said it would be impossible for Contra negotiators to get
together in time to reach Sapoa by Wednesday.
   Ortega publicly called for the talks last week and said Obando y
Bravo no longer would be needed because negotiators would meet
face-to-face.
   The Contras insisted on the presence of Obando y Bravo, a
frequent critic of the government who leads the Catholic church in
Nicaragua, as ``witness, moderator, and guarantor of the talks.''
   On Monday, Ortega asked the cardinal and Joao Baena Soares,
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, to
witness the talks.
   Baena Soares arrived in Managua on Tuesday, and Ortega announced
cancellation of the talks after meeting with him.
   Contra spokesmen also insisted Ortega's government agree to
discuss political points outlined by Obando y Bravo during the last
round Feb. 18 in Guatemala.
   His plan would require the Sandinistas to grant amnesty to
political prisoners, restore full press freedom, reopen talks with
internal political opposition parties and review the military draft
law.
   Sandinista and opposition sources said Obando y Bravo's
proposals caused his ouster as mediator.
   The Sandinistas have refused to discuss internal political
issues with the Contras. They say the only purpose of talks is to
work out a cease-fire in accordance with the regional peace plan
signed Aug. 7 by the five Central American presidents.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns Injunction; Would Allow IRS To Revoke PTL
Tax-Exempt Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has cleared the way for
the Internal Revenue Service to revoke PTL's tax exemption, which
could affect income for the Fort Mill television ministry.
   U.S. District Judge Karen Henderson on Monday overturned a
preliminary injunction against the IRS that Bankruptcy Judge Rufus
Reynolds issued in December.
   ``This puts the ball back in our court,'' IRS spokesman Les
Witmer of Atlanta said Tuesday. The IRS may revoke PTL's tax
exemption soon, he said.
   The IRS informed PTL Trustee David Clark in December that it
would revoke the exemption, retroactive to May 31, 1981. But Clark
got the injunction, and Reynolds ordered the IRS not to revoke
before May 1, 1988.
   ``The order of the bankruptcy court enjoining revocation of
PTL's tax exempt status was issued outside its jurisdiction and is
therefore reversed,'' Henderson ruled.
   Clark and PTL attorney Bradford Leggett of Winston-Salem, N.C.,
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
   The IRS granted PTL its tax exemption in 1973.
   Although the IRS can't collect back taxes while PTL is protected
by Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws, the impending revocation may affect
PTL contributors. The IRS calculates the back taxes at between $62
million and $82 million, while PTL's current leaders calculate the
amount owed at about $5 million.
   The ministry is engaged in a March telethon to raise $4 million.
   Henderson ruled that revoking the tax exempt status would cause
taxes to be assessed only against taxpayers who contribute to PTL _
contributors who are not debtors in bankruptcy.
   The IRS said that PTL's former leader, Jim Bakker, his wife,
Tammy, and top aides received excessive compensation that was not
consistent with the ministry's tax-exempt status. The IRS said the
couple received $11 million during their last seven years with the
ministry.
   Bakker resigned a year ago, admitting he had had a tryst with a
church secretary.

   The sheriff's office ended its witch
hunt, dropping efforts to obtain a list of library patrons who
check out books on the occult.
   Assistant District Attorney Dexter Ryland said Tuesday he had
advised the library against releasing the list, and the sheriff's
office withdrew its subpoena for the information.
   The Rapides Parish sheriff's office wanted the list to get
information on serious followers of satanic cults because such
beliefs often are connected with narcotics trafficking, said Chief
Deputy Tommy Hollingsworth.
   Library director Stephen Rogge said about 20 of the 150,000
books at the library deal with the occult.
   ``Most of it is pretty silly stuff actually, but they are
entertaining and people are curious,'' Rogge said.
   ``I've read some myself,'' he said. ``But I haven't sacrificed
any animals.''

   A 70-year-old kept a shotgun under his
pillow because of repeated break-ins, but the latest burglar got
the weapon without waking the man and shot the sleeper's cousin
with it, authorities said.
   Wally Newton woke up when he heard the blast and Simpson Brown
yelling after being shot in the leg early Monday.
   Brown, 70, and Newton share a home in Mead Valley, an
unincorporated area about 65 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   Brown told deputies he was sleeping when he saw a shadow pass
his bedroom.
   He called out, thinking it was Newton, but got no answer, said
Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. John Horton. Brown got up, and
found the burglar holding Newton's shotgun, according to Horton.
   ``He (Brown) grabbed the barrel,'' Horton said. The gun went
off. Brown yelled. Newton woke up.
   Brown was hospitalized in good condition. The burglar escaped
with the gun, Horton said.

   Police took a bite out of crime by

   ``He denies it, but we've got the teeth, and he doesn't,'' Sgt.

   Joseph Bennett, 62, was charged with strong-arm robbery, Hudson

   Bennett's dentures fell out Saturday when he tried to bite

   ``He was choking me, and then he tried to bite me on the arm,
but it was just gums,'' Ms. McCloud said Monday.
   Although her eyesight and hearing are failing, Ms. McCloud said
she had no trouble identifying Bennett as the robber.
   When police brought Bennett back to her house, Ms. McCloud said,
they had him try on the teeth left at her house.
   ``They fit right in his mouth,'' she said.

<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hearing-impaired theatergoers are calling for
a boycott of a stage production of ``Children of a Lesser God''
because only actors who can hear were cast, says an interpreter for
the deaf.
   ``A hearing person who pretends to be deaf is not going to look
right, and it's not going to be presented properly,'' Kellie
Perkins, who also has a hearing problem, said Tuesday.
   Director Mark Bacus disagreed, and said he tried unsuccessfully
to cast hearing-impaired actors for the Piasaw Players' amateur
production.
   The play, about the relationship between a deaf woman and a man
who can hear, won Tony awards in 1980. Marlee Matlin, who is deaf,
won an Oscar for her portrayal of the woman in the 1986 film
version.
   The drama was written specifically for deaf people, to show
their concerns to society, said Ms. Perkins, an interpreter at
Impact Inc., a center that helps the handicapped in this southern
Illinois community.
   ``What bothers me is that a hearing person cannot understand
what a deaf person feels,'' she said.
   The lead actress will be unable to learn all the required sign
language by showtime, Ms. Perkins said.
   Bacus said the actors will learn enough signing to handle their
parts well.
   ``All theater has to exaggerate to provide illusion,'' he said.
``If I do a show that has a French character, must I find somebody
that knows all French and the French culture?
   ``I don't want to fight. I'd rather carry on with the play,''
Bacus said.
   He said he tried to cast deaf or hearing-impaired actors, but
auditions last month, announced in the local newspaper and through
the theater group, drew just one hearing-impaired player.
   Rita Campbell of Alton, who is deaf, was unsuited for the lead,
Bacus said.
   Ms. Campbell, speaking through Ms. Perkins, said she'd received
up to 100 telephone calls from people with hearing problems urging
her to stop the play.
   ``Suppose someone pretended to be like you,'' she said. ``And
you saw it and said, `That's not how I act.' You'd be insulted.When
you use hearing people to portray deaf people, it makes us look
awkward and dumb.''
   Ms. Perkins said Ms. Campbell would meet this week with groups
of deaf and hearing-impaired people to make plans for a boycott if
there are no casting changes.
   ``It's sad and it's ridiculous,'' said Bacus, who received a few
letters protesting the casting.
   ``The play is going to go on,'' he said. ``It must. If I decide
to fold, then what's next? What other theater group will knuckle
under to special interest groups?''

<HEAD>Park Service Targets Removal of Controversial Tower at Gettysburg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Park Service officials are
pursuing a plan to buy and remove a 370-foot-high observation tower
that has overlooked the Civil War battlefield here for 15 years.
   ``My opinion is that the tower dominates the skyline at
Gettysburg and it's totally out of keeping with what we're trying
to accomplish here in preserving the battlefield,'' John Earnst,
Gettysburg National Military Park superintendent, said Tuesday.
   The preliminary proposal is part of a study ordered by Congress
to determine permanent boundaries for the park, site of the 1863
Union victory and President Abraham Lincoln's legendary address.
   The proposal, outlined at a meeting Monday night, has yet to be
reviewed by Park Service officials in Washington and would require
congressional approval, Earnst said.
   The steel tower, built in 1973 on private land separating parts
of the park, was the focus of controversy over preserving the park
area's historical integrity.
   When the tower was built, then-Gov. Milton Shapp brought an
unsuccessful lawsuit against attorney Thomas Ottenstein of
Bethesda, Md., who came up with the idea for the tower and is a
co-owner.
   Ottenstein, reached in Delray Beach, Fla., said he could not
comment about Monday's meeting because he was unaware of it. The
tower's manager, Gertrude Paris, also declined to comment.
   ``I didn't know a thing until I read the paper,'' she said.
   Congress ordered the study last year while passing legislation
to allow a group's donation of 30 acres to the park.
   The study has identified about 1,800 acres that should be added
to the 3,874-acre park, said planner Jonathan Doherty of the Park
Service's regional office in Philadelphia.

   Vice President George Bush humbled Bob Dole
with a Republican primary win in the Kansas senator's backyard,
while Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore triumphed convincingly in
Oklahoma's Democratic contest Tuesday.
   With 2,272 of 2,439 precincts or 93 percent reporting, Bush
edged Dole from with 69,813 votes or 37 percent to Dole's 66,147
votes or 35 percent. Pat Robertson was next with 40,039 votes or 21
percent and New York Rep. Jack Kemp was a distant fourth with
10,170 votes or 5 percent.
   In the Democratic race, with 2,317 of 2,439 precincts or 95
percent reporting, Gore had 154,217 votes or 41 percent, Gephardt
had 78,834 votes or 21 percent and Dukakis had 62,958 votes or 17
percent.
   Jesse Jackson was next with 48,556 votes or 13 percent; former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 13,897 votes or 4 percent; and Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon had 6,460 votes or 2 percent.
   The Democrats were competing for 46 delegates; the Republicans
for 36.
   A poll broadcast by two television stations last week showed
Gephardt, Gore and Dukakis each getting 18 percent of the
Democratic vote. But 27 percent of those surveyed between Feb. 26
and March 1 were still undecided.
   Dole crisscrossed the state in the closing days and stepped up
his advertising campaign in an effort to overtake Bush, the
perceived front-runner who was endorsed by Gov. Henry Bellmon and
most prominent state political leaders.
   Ads for Dole touted his positions on agriculture and reducing
the federal deficit. Dole was supported by U.S. Sen. Don Nickles.
   Matt Seward, Bush campaign director in Oklahoma, said Oklahoma
was ``a special prize'' since it was listed by Dole operatives as
one of the states Dole was counting on to win.
   ``If he can't win in Oklahoma, where can he win?'' Seward asked.

   Mississippi Democrats picked a young congressman as their
candidate to replace John C. Stennis in the U.S. Senate, while
Democratic Sens. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas easily overcame little-known primary opponents Tuesday.
   As the first state primaries coincided with Super Tuesday, Rep.
Wayne Dowdy defeated Secretary of State Dick Molpus for the
Democratic Senate nomination in Mississippi. He is expected to face
a hard fight from Rep. Trent Lott, the House minority whip who was
unopposed in the Republican primary.
   With 90 percent of the vote counted, Dowdy had 167,640 votes or
54 percent to Molpus' 133,547 votes or 43 percent. A third
candidate, pipefitter Gilbert Fountain, had 11,454 or 4 percent.
   Molpus saluted the winner as ``a decent and likable man. He has
conveyed those characteristics to the people of this state and we
pay him tribute.''
   Texas Republicans will need a runoff to choose Bentsen's
opponent, while Republican Jim McCrery advanced to a runoff against
Democratic state Sen. Foster Campbell to fill the U.S. House seat
being vacated by governor-elect Buddy Roemer.
   Sarbanes easily won renomination for a third term and will face
Thomas Blair, a millionaire political newcomer who beat eight other
candidates for the Republican nomination. With 78 percent of the
vote counted, Blair had 54,408 votes or 47 percent while none of
his eight opponents had more than 13 percent.
   In Arkansas, Rep. William Alexander swamped political consultant
Darrell Glascock in the Democratic primary, and won re-election
because there is no Republican opposition. With 56 percent of the
vote counted, Alexander had 54,079 or 66 percent to Glascock's
27,570 or 34 percent.
   Rep. Jamie Whitten, seeking his 25th term, and Rep. Mike Espy,
Mississippi's first black congressman since Reconstruction, were
overwhelming winners in Democratic primaries. There were tight,
crowded races in both parties for the nominations to succeed Dowdy
and Lott..
   In a rematch of the 1982 primary, Bentsen defeated professor Joe
Sullivan of San Antonio by better than 5-1. With 48 percent of the
vote counted, Bentsen had 587,121 votes or 84 percent to 114,946 or
16 percent for Sullivan.
   Houston millionaire Wes Gilbreath and U.S. Rep. Beau Boulter of
Amarillo were headed for a runoff for the GOP nomination to oppose
Bentsen.
   With 39 percent of the vote counted, Gilbreath had 101,292 or 35
percent and Boulter had 96,212 or 33 percent. Former state Rep.
Milton Fox of Austin had 53,481 or 18 percent and businessman Ned
Snead of Georgetown had 41,564 or 14 percent.
   With returns 91 percent complete in Louisiana's 4th District,
McCrery had 30,859 or 30 percent while Campbell nailed down the
other spot in the April 16 runoff with 21,278 or 21 percent.
   Stan Tiner, the former editor of the Shreveport Journal who had
Roemer's support, was third with 15,600 or 15 percent, followed by
June Phillips, the only black in the race, with 13,479 or 13
percent and state Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach with 12,254 or 12
percent.
   Roemer will resign on Monday to become governor.

   Roemer said he would vote for Tiner, and even gave his campaign
a check, but insisted he had not formally endorsed anyone.
   Dowdy, 44, stressed his seven years experience as a member of
Congress, while the 38-year-old Molpus pointed to his record as
director of federal-state programs under former Gov. William Winter
and as secretary of state since 1984.
   Mississippi is one of the states where the GOP hopes to reduce
or even reverse the Democrats' 54-46 advantage in the Senate.
Eighteen of the 33 seats at stake this year are held by Democrats.
   Stennis, 86, retiring after 41 years in the Senate, did not
choose sides in the Democratic primary.
   Bentsen, who is seeking a fourth term has said he is prepared to
spend $10 million in November, and didn't care who the Republican
nominee was.
   Gilbreath was the big spender in the Texas GOP race, investing
about $500,000 of his own money.
   In addition to the Mississippi race, Republican hopes in the
Senate this year were spurred by the retirement of Democratic Sen.
William Proxmire of Wisconsin and Sen. Lawton Chiles of Florida.
   However, the GOP is losing Sens. Paul Trible of Virginia, Daniel
Evans of Washington and Robert T. Stafford of Vermont.
   In New Jersey, Republican businessmen Pete Dawkins _ a West
Point football star, Rhodes scholar, decorated combat veteran and
former Army general _ is challenging Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
who is seeking a second term.
   In New York, Republicans had hoped to mount a strong challenge
to incumbent Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but were disappointed
when high-profile federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani ruled himself
out.

<HEAD>Prosector Says Gangster Accused Of Journalist's Slaying Acted On
Orders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese gangster accused of
fatally shooting a Chinese-American journalist was acting on orders
from the head of Taiwan's intelligence agency, a prosecutor charged
Tuesday.
   In his opening statements, Assistant District Attorney Bob
Bishop told the jury that Taiwanese Adm. Wang Hsi-ling hired Tung
Kuei-sen to assassinate Henry Liu, whose writings were highly
critical of the Taiwanese government.
   Liu's wife, Helen, also testified before the jury in San Mateo
County Superior Court. Tung, an acknowledged member of the
Taiwanese crime syndicate known as the Bamboo Gang and one of two
alleged triggermen in the slaying, entered a plea of innocent last
June.
   Tung, 35, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for herion
smuggling.
   The 52-year-old Liu was gunned down at his Daly City home on
Oct. 15, 1984. He was a columnist for Chinese-language newspapers
in San Francisco and had just published an unflattering biography
of Taiwan President Chiang Chung-kuo when he was slain.
   Bishop said that Liu was making it known that he was about to
publish memoirs of a former high-ranking Taiwanese official,
something that Hsi-ling feared would be embarrassing and damaging
to President Chiang. Chiang died in January.
   Wang, the admiral, wanted Liu killed before the memoirs were
published, Bishop said. Wang hired Bamboo Gang leader Chen Chi-li,
who surrounded himself with a group of men, including defendant
Tung, to help carry out the assassination plot, the prosecutor said.
   The memoirs contained nothing that would shock U.S. citizens,
Bishop said. But in Taiwan, anything dealing with the personal
lives of the president or his father, Chiang Kai-shek, were
considered treasonous, he said.
   Mrs. Liu testified Tuesday afternoon, tearfully describing her
husband's murder.
   She said that the day before the slaying, she noticed two people
on bicycles surveying their neighborhood. However, their faces were
covered with hooded sweatshirts and she did not think anything of
it until following day, when she noticed they had returned on the
bikes.
   Less than an hour later, she said she sent her husband down into
the garage to load boxes into their car and heard a loud noise. She
went downstairs and found her husband dying on the garage floor.
   She also said that before her husband's slaying, the Taiwan
government had started sending over former friends of her husband's
to try and persuade him to quit his critical writings.
   The suspects in the slaying fled and eventually resurfaced in
Taiwan, believing they had acted on the orders of the Taiwanese
government, Bishop said. The suspects thought they were immune from
prosecution, he said.
   However, the slaying had strained U.S.-Taiwan relations, and the
United States began putting so much pressure on Chiang's regime
that ``something had to be done,'' Bishop said.
   Chen and another Bamboo Gang member were convicted of the murder
in Taiwan in 1985 and given life sentences, and three top Taiwanese
intelligence officers were also separately convicted by a military
court in the alleged murder plot.
   But Tung fled Taiwan and eventually became the only one of Liu's
suspected killers to be brought to trial in the United States.

   Jesse Jackson repeated his 1984 Democratic
primary victory here Tuesday, staving off Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s
bid for an upset, while George Bush swamped the GOP field.
   In a special election, a Republican former aide to Democratic
Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer led the 10-candidate field to succeed
Roemer in Congress, but was forced into an April 16 runoff with a
state senator.
   In the Democratic race, with 2,903 of 3,272 precincts or 89
percent reporting, Jackson had 194,118 or 34 percent; Tennessee's
Gore had 168,500 votes or 30 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis had 83,117 votes or 15 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt had 61,375 votes or 11 percent.
   In Republican voting, Bush left Sen. Bob Dole battling for
second place with Pat Robertson. With 2,857 of 3,272 precincts or
87 percent reporting, Bush had 76,155 votes or 58 percent;
Robertson had 24,052 votes or 18 percent; Dole had 23,354 votes or
18 percent; New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 6,665 votes or 5 percent.
   The Democrats were deciding 63 convention delegates; the
Republicans 41.
   In the closing days of the Democratic presidential primary,
Roemer endorsed Gore, who said he felt his campaign was gaining
steam in the state, but the same claim was made by Kitty Dukakis,
the wife of the Massachusetts governor.
   Backers of former television evangelist Robertson claimed their
work was responsible for most of the 19,000 voters who switched
their registrations from Democratic to Republican. The Rev. Billy
McCormack, Robertson's state campaign director, predicted the
former TV evangelist would carry Louisiana.
   In the 4th Congressional District, Roemer's former congressional
aide Jim McCrery, the sole Republican in the race, was forced into
a runoff with state Sen. Foster Campbell to succeed Roemer in the
U.S. House.
   With 91 percent of the vote in, McCrery had 30,859 votes, or 30
percent, to 21,278 or 21 percent for Campbell; former Shreveport
newsman Stan Tiner was third with 15,600 votes, or 15 percent. June
Phillips, the only black in the race, gather 13,479 votes, or 13
percent and state Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, who held the seat
for one term until he was defeated by Roemer in 1980, had 12,254
votes, or 12 percent.
   Roemer resigns on Monday to become governor.

<HEAD>US Contributed To Settlements With Challenger Families Who
Couldn't Sue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government contributed 40 percent to
settlements for two Challenger astronauts who worked for the
government even though federal law protects the government against
claims like theirs.
   A key legal reason: The government was concerned that Morton
Thiokol would end up passing claims against it along to the federal
government. Thiokol made the defective rockets that were blamed for
the Challenger explosion, but government officials had also spurned
warnings by Thiokol engineers that a launch on Jan. 28, 1986, might
be unsafe because of cold temperatures at Cape Canaveral.
   Relatives of all seven astronauts were free to sue Morton
Thiokol for damages, but only the families of the two
non-government employees _ high school teacher Christa McAuliffe
and Hughes Aircraft employee Gregory Jarvis _ were allowed to sue
the federal government.
   Documents released by the government this week to settle a
lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act by The
Associated Press and six other news organizations show that the
government and Morton Thiokol paid $7,735,000 in cash and annuities
to settle with the four spouses and six children of Dick Scobee,
Ellison Onizuka, Jarvis and McAuliffe.
   Scobee was a civilian astronaut with the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Onizuka was an Air Force lieutenant
colonel.
   The government has refused to contribute to settlements reached
by Morton Thiokol with the survivors of civilian NASA astronauts
Ronald McNair and Judith Resnik.
   And last month, government lawyers opposing a lawsuit filed by
the family of the other military officer aboard, Navy Cmdr. Michael
Smith, got the government dropped as a defendant because he was a
military officer.
   The government documents showed that Morton Thiokol paid 60
percent and the government 40 percent of the settlement with the
four families.
   In a letter to the news organizations that sued, Justice
Department lawyer Joanne S. Marchetta stipulated that the ``single
percentage split ... is applicable to all four settlements in the
aggregate.''
   The government did not require Morton Thiokol to bear a larger
share of the settlement with the Scobee and Onizuka relatives, even
though those families could sue only the company.
   In a brief filed in the FOI case, the government suggested why
it contributed at all to the Scobee and Onizuka settlements.
   ``It was entirely possible under the facts presented by the
Challenger accident that the government would be brought in as a
third party to any claims by the families brought against
government contractors like MTI,'' the brief said.
   That reference was to the objections by Morton Thiokol engineers
to launching the shuttle in extreme cold _ objections that were
withdrawn under government pressure.
   Ronald Krist, a Houston lawyer who represented the McNairs,
Jarvis' father and Resnik's mother, noted that a 1983 Supreme Court
decision allows a contractor who pays damages to a federal
employee's survivors to try to recover part of those damages from
the government if federal employees shared the blame. So far,
however, Morton Thiokol has made no move to do this.
   ``That law is on the books and that would give the government
the theoretical incentive to settle'' with the families of
government workers, Krist said.
   Thus, by entering into joint settlements with Thiokol and the
families, the government extinguished the potential third-party
claim of Thiokol against the government in these four cases and
avoided trials that would have replayed the painful government
errors that led to the fateful decision to launch in cold weather.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis parlayed
a strong statewide organization into a decisive victory in Idaho's
Democratic presidential caucuses on Tuesday.
   With 34 of 45 precincts or 76 percent reporting, Dukakis had 727
votes or 43 percent; uncommitted received 470 votes or 28 percent;
Jesse Jackson had 269 votes or 16 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. had 107 votes or 6 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had
65 votes or 4 percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 41
votes or 2 percent.
   State party Chairman Mel Morgan and Gov. Cecil Andrus led a
campaign to have as many of Tuesday's caucus participants as
possible remain uncommitted. Idaho has only 18 delegates at stake.
   ``This thing is looking more and more like a brokered
convention,'' Morgan said, ``so we might as well get some power
while we can.''

<HEAD>IRS Losing Less to Tax Cheats, Commissioner Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is preparing to
report that Americans are cheating less on their federal tax
returns even though the government is still losing as much as $90
billion a year to scofflaws.
   That figure for the 1987 ``tax gap'' doesn't even include untold
billions that are lost because illegal income is never reported to
the IRS.
   Nevertheless, says IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs, ``the
amount of the tax gap has diminished since the last time we did a
study.'' That was in 1983, when the IRS estimated an $81.5-billion
tax gap that would rise to more than $100 billion by 1987.
   Gibbs, defending the IRS's proposed budget before a House
Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, said the new tax-gap study
could be released within a week. The new figure will be between $80
billion and $90 billion, he said.
   He attributed the decline in cheating to several actions by
Congress and the IRS to force better compliance with the tax laws,
including enhanced ability to match virtually every tax return with
supporting income statements filed by employers, banks and other
payers. Gibbs also suggested the massive tax revision enacted in
1986 contributed to better compliance.
   In other developments:
   _Gibbs said the IRS is temporarily suspending efforts to collect
back taxes from many students whose colleges paid them stipends for
research or teaching assignments in 1984, 1985 or 1986. The
colleges reported those stipends to the IRS as income but many
students failed to report them on their tax returns.
   ``We've put the word out (to IRS offices) to hold up on any''
such cases until the agency can develop a uniform policy on how to
treat stipends paid in those years, he said. The 1986 tax revision
cleared up any ambiguity for subsequent years; all stipends are
taxable.
   Some IRS field offices are following a 1975 IRS ruling that set
guidelines for taxing some stipends; others follow different court
interpretations.
   Several colleges have reported numerous graduate students
receiving tax-due notices from the IRS because of their stipends.
The Washington Post cited one unofficial estimate that up to 17,000
students might be involved and that several have already filed suit
in Tax Court to contest the assessments.
   Gibbs said the IRS has no campaign to crack down on these
students, but blamed their problems on the fact their tax returns
did not square with their W-2 earnings statements. He said he hopes
the agency can have a clear-cut policy within a month.
   _More than one-third of taxpayers have filed their 1987 returns,
and, despite the sweeping nature of the 1986 tax overhaul, the IRS
is finding only about 2{ percent more errors this year than last,
Gibbs said. ``I'm delighted,'' he said.
   _The IRS issued a reminder that a new tax on certain vaccines is
now in effect. Although it is imposed on producers, it is likely to
be passed on to patients. The tax, which was enacted last December,
will finance compensation for patients who die or are injured
because of vaccinations.
   The tax is $4.56 for a dose of DPT (diphtheria, whopping cough
and tetanus) vaccine; 6 cents for diphtheria and tetanus; $4.44 for
measles, mumps and rubella, and 28 cents for polio.
   The last IRS study of the tax gap, published in 1983, estimated
that individuals and corporations dodged $81.5 billion in taxes on
legal income in 1981 by understating income and overstating
deductions.
   The agency estimated that another $9 billion in taxes was lost
on three types of illegal income: drugs, prostitution and gambling.
The new report will not even attempt to estimate the tax loss from
illegal income that is never reported.
   Since the last tax gap study was published, IRS researchers have
found evidence that taxpayers may be cheating less. In May 1986,
the agency released a preliminary report indicating that a 20-year
trend of declining compliance with the tax laws might have been
reversed.
   That study estimated that voluntary compliance rose to 91.8
percent in 1982, from 91.0 percent in 1979. Compliance had declined
steadily from 94.3 percent in 1965.

   An episode of NBC's new series ``Day by Day''
placed second to perennial favorite ``The Cosby Show'' and helped
the network climb back to the top of the ratings after ABC's two
weeks as No. 1.
   NBC won the ratings for the week that ended Sunday with an
average prime-time A.C. Nielsen Co. rating of 16.3. CBS had a 15.0
rating and ABC, whose 16 days of Winter Olympics coverage
catapulted it to the top the previous two weeks, fell back to
third, with a 12.8.
   For the season, NBC continues in the lead with a 16.3 overall
rating to ABC's 14.1 and CBS's 13.6.
   A rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households
with televisions.
   The episode of ``Day By Day'' that ranked second was shown at
8:30 p.m. Thursday, after No. 1-rated ``The Cosby Show.''
   ``Day By Day,'' a comedy about a young couple operating a home
daycare center, also was shown by NBC on Sunday night after
``Family Ties'' and on Monday night after ``ALF.''
   The Sunday night show placed 20th in the Nielsen ratings and the
Monday night show 14th. The show's regular slot will be Sunday
night, where it received its lowest rating.
   The three-hour Grammy Awards show on CBS, which featured a rare
television performance by Michael Jackson, finished eighth.
   ``The Cosby Show'' on NBC was rated No. 1 for the week with a
31.4 rating.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was No. 3 with a 25.9, followed by NBC's
``Night Court'' with a 24.5.
   ABC's ``Growing Pains'' was No. 5 with a 24.5 rating, and its
``Who's The Boss?'' was next with a 22.0.
   CBS' ``The Golden Girls'' held seventh place with a 21.5 rating,
followed by a tie between the Grammys and CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' at
21.0.
   No. 10 was NBC's ``ALF,'' with a 20.5 rating.
   In the news category, ``The CBS Evening News'' was No. 1, with
an 11.3 rating. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 11.2 rating, and
the ``NBC Nightly News'' 9.6.

<HEAD>US Sanctions Possible Against Panama This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's military regime could find itself
subject to ``a whole panoply'' of economic sanctions by the end of
this week, including the withholding of $6.5 million this month for
use of the Panama Canal, U.S. officials say.
   Final decisions on the sanctions are expected at an inter-agency
meeting scheduled Thursday, said the officials, who insisted on
anonymity. A formal announcement is likely either Thursday or
Friday, they added.
   The economic punishment is intended to aggravate an already
acute cash shortage in that country and pressure military strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega out of office.
   The officials spoke late Tuesday, the same day that the House
Foreign Affairs Committee urged president Reagan to consider
economic sanctions against Panama's military regime.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in response to the
House committee vote that the administration would not take such
action lightly.
   ``The threat's still out there,'' Fitzwater said. ``The
situation is changing rapidly and we're still monitoring it. But we
don't want to act precipitously.''
   The administration has called for Noriega's ouster since he was
indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in Florida last month
and for a return to civilian rule under President Eric Arturo
Delvalle.
   Another sanction being considered is the withdrawal of
Panamanian participation in a system of trade preferences accorded
to most Third World countries, the officials said. This would make
Panamanian products more expensive in U.S. markets.
   Another possibility, they said, is Panama's exclusion from the
Caribbean Basin Initiative under which some Panamanian products can
be exported to the United States without duties.
   Also being considered is suspension of Alaskan oil shipments
through a trans-Panamanian pipeline, from which oil is delivered to
U.S. markets on the East Coast.
   On March 15, the United States is due to pay the $6.5 million
monthly installment to the Panama Canal Commission on the $75
million to $80 million paid out each year under the canal treaties.
   ``The sanctions are not something that we want to do, but
something that we feel would be responsive and would be helpful,
but it's not an action we take lightly,'' Fitzwater said.
   Delvalle has been in hiding for more than a week after
attempting to fire Noriega and being, in turn, dismissed by him.
   In statement issued at both the White House and State Department
on Tuesday, the administration said it recognizes Delvalle ``as he
who now exercises the office of president.''
   The statement welcomed declarations by Delvalle and Panamanian
opposition parties on Monday that called for the establishment of a
``government of national reconciliation.''
   ``This is a blueprint for progress for democracy in Panama,''
the U.S. statement said. ``We support their goal of restoring
democratic government and civilian constitutional order. Once this
goal has been achieved, we will work cooperatively with the
government of Panama toward the recovery of Panama's financial and
economic health.''
   Fitzwater said the decision on possible sanctions depends upon
``a very complicated set of criteria.''
   Among them, he said, are the status of the Noriega government
and the impact that sanctions might have on U.S. interests in
Panama. He mentioned the canal and U.S. investments.
   In its unanimous vote, the Foreign Affairs Committee endorsed
Reagan's course of action against the military regime as well as
urging him to consider sanctions.
   The resolution will be voted on by the House this week. It
reaffirms congressional support for the full implementation of the
Panama Canal treaties, which require the United States to hand the
canal over to Panama at the end of the century.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has adopted a resolution
calling for a total trade embargo against Panama, but several
members of the House panel said they thought that approach was
premature.

<HEAD>NBC Gave North Carolina to Jackson, Then Gore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the networks' race to call Super Tuesday
contests, NBC News incorrectly predicted that Jesse Jackson would
win the North Carolina Democratic primary, then switched its pick
to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. about an hour later.
   NBC declared Jackson the winner shortly after the state's polls
closed at 7:30 p.m. EST, said spokeswoman Mary Lou O'Callaghan.
``We made a mistake,'' she said. ``We retracted the projection and
shortly afterward, we called Gore.''
   Gore won with 35 percent, to Jackson's 33 percent.
   O'Callaghan said the projections are based on totals from the
News Election Service, sample precincts and exit polling. ``We used
the same criteria we use in making all our calls, and this one was
just wrong,'' she said.

   Mary Fishbyrne, a 101-year-old politicial
activist who hasn't missed voting since women were given that
right, fumed because she couldn't vote for the man of her choice.
   ``Why can't I vote for Bush?'' a snippish voice said from behind
the voting machine curtain on Super Tuesday.
   ``Because you're registered as a Democrat, Miss Mary,'' precinct
commissioner Betty Shelton said apologetically. ``Crossover voting
isn't allowed in presidential primaries.''
   ``I'm just miserable,'' came back the curtained voice. ``I'll
vote for Bush in November.''
   ``She's kind of independent,'' Shelton explained.
   If anything, Mary Fishbyrne is independent, brought up that way
by her father on a South Dakota farm before that state was admitted
to the union.
   ``He raised us that way,'' she said. ``He had six daughters and
was mad because we couldn't vote. He named my youngest sister after
Susan B. Anthony _ you know she gave us the vote.''
   Miss Fishbyrne's first vote came in 1921 near the Virginia farm
her father purchased when she was 12.
   ``I remember I didn't vote for Hoover. He was the worst. He told
us to mix our corn meal with flour to make it last. I never did
know what he wanted to last the longest _ the corn meal or the
flour. I'd rather have just a little of both.''
   Her favorite president was Franklin Roosevelt. ``He must have
been, he had the most terms.''
   Miss Fishbyrne, who was born Aug. 18, 1886, was a seamstress and
tailor for most of her adult life. Since reaching age 65, she has
been living with various relatives throughout the United States.
   She moved to Shreveport in 1961 to live with a niece and they
mostly vote Republican, she said.
   ``We voted for Reagan. I think Bush will be pretty good.''
   She said she can't understand why people don't get out and vote.
   ``I was 35 before I was allowed to vote and I know what it's
like when you can't. It's a privilege some people don't
appreciate.''
   She never married because her fiance died shortly after her
father was killed in a fall from a wagon.
   ``Dad was so proud when my sisters and I went to vote. I'm the
only one left. I'll vote as long as I have legs to walk.''
   ``Well, you've never missed an election here and we're going to
have another one in April before the November election,'' Shelton
told her favorite voter.
   ``I'll be here,'' Miss Mary promised.

   Lofti Mansouri, head of the Canadian Opera
in Toronto, has been offered the job of general director of the San
Francisco Opera.
   Mansouri has been a leading candidate for the position since
Terence A. McEwen announced on Feb. 9 that he would retire.
   ``They have offered it and I am considering it very seriously,''
Mansouri said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Toronto. He
said he would make a decision by Friday.
   The San Francisco Opera Association's board of directors on
Tuesday accepted the recomendation of a subcommittee and authorized
that the job be offered to Mansouri.
   Mansouri, 58, a native of Iran, has directed 31 productions for
the San Francisco opera on a visiting basis since 1963.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street investor jitters eased enough to
allow the closely watched Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
to rise to its highest level since the October market crash.
   The Dow on Tuesday finished up 24.70, to 2,081.07, the best
post-crash close since 2,071.62 on Feb. 29.
   Analysts said the rally partly reflected a desire by managers of
institutional investment funds to put unused money to work before
they present their portfolios when the first quarter ends in three
weeks.
   ``We're coming into show-and-tell time, the window-dressing
period,'' said Lawrence Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. ``These guys can't sit there with piles of cash in
a boiling market and not get called down by the people who pay them
to manage money.''
   Takeover speculation and increased demand for high-yield and
blue chip stocks also powered the rally.
   Two stocks advanced for every one that fell on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 237.68 million shares,
compared with 152.98 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Bush Edges Dole In GOP Primary, Gephardt's Home State His Sole
Victory</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush rocked Bob
Dole's presidential hopes with a narrow primary victory in the GOP
senator's back yard, steamrolling to a Super Tuesday sweep.
   And Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt, an overwhelming winner in
his home state's first presidential primary, found it was his only
victory of the night.
   In Republican voting, with 3,851 of 3,954 precincts or 97
percent reporting, Bush had 169,427 votes or 42 percent; Kansas'
Dole had 164,646 votes or 41 percent; Pat Robertson had 44,379
votes or 11 percent; New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 14,178 votes or 4
percent.
   In the Democratic race, with 3,900 of 3,954 precincts or 99
percent reporting, Gephardt had 290,289 votes or 60 percent; Jesse
Jackson had 83,749 votes or 17 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis had 59,132 votes or 12 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
had 20,095 votes or 4 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had
14,284 votes or 3 percent.
   ``This has been absolutely wild,'' Bush's Missouri campaign
director, Randy Enwright, said of the GOP race. ``No matter what,
we don't lose here.''
   Enwright and Missouri Bush supporter Bill Macon said Dole needed
to win big in Missouri rather than just edge Bush slightly in his
neighbor state.
   ``Sure, if it's close, that's good, but I really wanted to break
Dole's political back here,'' Macon said.
   Dole accused Bush of trying to deliver a ``knockout punch'' in
Missouri by canceling stops in other states while Bush said Dole
probably thought he ``could dust me off'' in Missouri since it was
next to Dole's homestate of Kansas.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's national campaign manager, said Dole would
be in trouble if he lost Missouri.
   ``Bob Dole has repeatedly said Missouri is his most important
state. He's been here more than anyone else and spent more money.
He's practically campaigned as a favorite son candidate. He's sure
going to be rocking and reeling if he loses here,'' Atwater said.
   While Bush and Dole fought for the lion's share of the 47 GOP
delegates at stake, Gephardt, a congressman from the St. Louis
area, overwhelmed the 11 other Democrats listed on the ballot,
competing for 77 convention delegates.
   ``It's been a one-man show from the beginning,'' said Missouri
Democratic Party Chairman Betty Hearnes. ``We just haven't seen
anybody else.''

   An overwhelming black vote carried Jesse Jackson
to victory over Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore in Georgia's Democratic
presidential primary, while Vice President George Bush crushed
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   With 2,461 of 2,571 precincts or 96 percent reporting early
today, Jackson had 235,088 votes or 39 percent; Gore had 194,824
votes or 33 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 93,442
votes or 16 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 40,658
votes or 7 percent, and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 15,384
votes or 3 percent.
   In the Republican race, with 2,398 of 2,571 precincts or 93
percent reporting, Bush had 188,512 votes or 53 percent; Dole had
81,647 votes or 23 percent; former television evangelist Pat
Robertson had 57,901 votes or 16 percent, and New York Rep. Jack
Kemp had 21,662 votes or 6 percent.
   Gore had won the backing of Sen. Sam Nunn, Gov. Joe Frank Harris
and state House Speaker Tom Murphy.
   But Jackson scored big in Georgia's 5th Congressional District,
composed largely of Atlanta, where he beat both Gore and Dukakis by
better than 8-to-1.
   According to ABC News exit polls, Jackson won 95 percent of
Georgia's black Democratic vote, and added 10 percent of the
state's white Democratic votes. He even picked up 117 votes in
Forsyth County, the virtually all-white site of racial violence and
civil rights marches in 1987.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, like Jackson a veteran of the civil
rights movement, said the strong showings by Jackson and Gore ``are
probably good for the South. Both Jesse and Al Gore represent where
the South is.''
   The Republicans had 48 delegates up for grabs. The Democrats
offered 77 delegates to their convention in Atlanta in July.
   Robertson, who watched the returns in Atlanta, vowed that he is
still a contender.
   ``This is not the end,'' he told supporters. ``This is just the
beginning. We're going to New Orleans. ... I'm in all the way. I'm
in to see a Republican conservative Congress in 1990, and we're in
for the presidential race in 1992.''

<HEAD>Committee Democrats Say Attorney General Should Step Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is rejecting
a request by 11 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee that he
temporarily step down until pending federal investigations into his
conduct have been completed.
   ``This is an old idea, a politically partisan idea and a
thoroughly bad idea,'' Meese's chief spokesman, Terry Eastland,
said Tuesday after being informed of the request. ``No one should
be urged to step down from a government position simply because
that person is under investigation.''
   The Democrats said in their letter, ``We strongly believe that
your increasing inability to spend time on the day-to-day demands
of your job, the deteriorating morale at the Department of Justice,
and the continuing cloud over your office are undermining your
ability to act effectively as the nation's chief law enforcement
officer.''
   Meese has been under criminal investigation by independent
counsel James McKay since last May 11. McKay has been examining
Meese's involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., and with a
$1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. McKay also has been
examining the attorney general's involvement with the regional Bell
telephone companies at a time when he owned $14,000 in phone stock.
   In addition, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, investigating
the Iran-Contra affair, has called Meese before a grand jury
numerous times.
   Eastland said Meese ``has every intention of serving to the end
of this term.''
   ``He has spent some time with his lawyers on the investigation,
but there has been no serious subtraction of his time or effort
from leadership of the Department of Justice,'' Eastland said.
   The letter said the pending investigations ``detract from the
time required to properly administer the Department of Justice.''
   ``The pervasive perception that you have allowed personal
considerations to encroach on your constitutional responsibilities
threatens to breed contempt for your office, your administration
and the rule of law itself,'' the lawmakers said.
   The letter was signed by Reps. Dan Glickman, Kan.; Edward
Feighan, Ohio; Howard Berman, Calif.; Barney Frank, Mass.; Bruce
Morrison, Conn.; Lawrence Smith, Fla.; Harley Staggers Jr., W. Va.;
John Conyers, Mich.; George Crockett Jr., Mich.; Mike Synar, Okla.;
and Patricia Schroeder, Colo.

   Thousands of mourners attended the
funerals of three Israelis killed in a Palestinian terrorist
attack, many sobbing uncontrollably as relatives threw themselves
on the coffins of their beloved.
   ``Such killings ... only strengthen our lust for and link to
this land, to this country,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
the 5,000 Israelis who attended the services Tuesday.
   Services were held for the three residents of this southern
Negev desert town who were killed Monday, when three Palestinian
guerrillas hijacked a commuter bus. Nine Israelis were wounded.
   Anti-terrorist police stormed the bus three hours after the
hijacking and 15 minutes after the guerrilla leader shot to death
Victor Ran, 39, a widower and father of three children.
   The guerrillas, from Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah branch of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, were killed during the
30-second rescue operation.
   Two Israelis, Rina Shiratzky, 31, a mother of two, and Miriam
Ben Yair, 46, mother of four, were fatally wounded in the rescue.
   The guerrillas were demanding freedom for hundreds of
Palestinians held in Israeli jails on rioting charges.
   ``We have to hold responsible all the countries in the region,
the Arab states from where the murderers came and where you read
and hear today in the media praises for this murder,'' Shamir said.
   ``The war of the Jewish people for their land, the land of
Israel, is not over .... Despite our tremendous longing for peace,
there are still people _ if they might be called human beings _ who
are after our blood,'' he said.
   Family members of the dead threw themselves on the coffins,
screaming in grief and clutching the lids. Many in the crowd sobbed
as they gazed at the coffins, which had been placed on a sunlit
podium.
   Maj. Gen Yitzhak Mordechai, chief of the army's central command
who headed the rescue operation, also spoke at the funerals.
   ``We promise today near their coffins not to rest in continuing
the holy enterprise of mantaining security along the borders of
Israel and within the country,'' Mordechai said.
   ``The murderers have found their death yesterday. Some day we
will reach those who sent them.''

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Siting Plan For Black Revolutionary War Patriots
Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A measure that would let a memorial to the
black veterans of the Revolutionary War be built in the
most-traveled tourist area of Washington has won subcommittee
approval, but the House has just four weeks to act.
   A vote by the House Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee on
national parks and public lands followed pleas Tuesday by
historians, black activists and the Reagan administration.
   ``The Patriots Memorial is not a war memorial; it is not an
ethnic memorial,'' said Maurice A. Barboza, a Virginia lawyer who
has been the driving force behind the project. ``As a memorial to
the struggle for freedom, it will stand as a universal symbol to
define for generations to come our American nationality, which is
based on principles rather than on pigmentation.''
   The subcommittee also approved, without discussion, locating a
planned Korean War memorial in the city's prime tourist area.
   Last year, President Reagan signed into law a measure pushed by
Barboza that authorizes a black patriots memorial in Washington.
   But Barboza, formerly of Plainville, Conn., and Rep. Nancy L.
Johnson, R-Conn., whom he enlisted to carry on the fight in
Congress, want the memorial in a prominent place, a move that
requires another layer of administrative and legislative approvals.
   Last November, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel declared that
Barboza's proposal had ``pre-eminent historical and lasting
significance to the nation.'' That finding is needed to place a
memorial in the city's monument-filled Area I, which includes the
Mall, the Ellipse, Lafayette Park and West Potomac Park.
   The Senate has approved the siting resolution, but the House
only has until April 7 to take action. Without congressional
approval, the memorial cannot be placed in Area I.
   Robert K. Wright, an Army historian, said most history books
ignored the role of the estimated 5,000 blacks who served in the
Continental Army.
   Even if the Area I legislation is accepted, proponents still
would have to go back to the Interior Department, Commission of
Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission to get
specific siting and design approval.
   Barboza, who quit his job as a lobbyist for the American Bar
Association to work on the memorial project full time, envisions a
``modest'' memorial nestled in Constitution Gardens, a grassy area
near both the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument.

<HEAD>Firefighters Angry Over Commercial Licensing Requirement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's firefighters are incensed by a
federal law that could require them to obtain commercial licenses
if they want to continue to drive their equipment.
   The Commercial Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, which is being phased
in starting this year, will require commercial licenses of anyone
who operates a vehicle that weighs 26,000 pounds or more, carries
15 or more people or transports hazardous materials.
   But associations representing many of the nation's 225,000 paid
and 900,000 volunteer firefighters say the law was meant to foster
safety in the commercial trucking business, not impose costly new
rules on their members.
   Tim Butters, a spokesman for the International Association of
Fire Chiefs, said Tuesday, ``The burden on the fire service is
going to be very significant when this law goes through because of
the road test that they're going to have to go through, the
(written) examination, and I think there's going to be a lot of
cost factors.''
   Stanley Hamilton of the Federal Highway Administration said the
licensing regulations won't be ready until July 15, and they will
be phased in through 1992. The law also will affect farmers who
drive heavy equipment, and Hamilton said his agency has been
inundated with protest mail from farm communities.
   Under the law, the secretary of transportation may issue waivers
``with respect to class of persons or class of vehicles,'' but
Hamilton said requests for exemptions would not be considered until
the regulations are written.
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., wrote to Transportation
Secretary James Burnley last week to ask that firefighters be
exempted from the commercial license requirement.
   ``Let's solve the problem with truckers, not create new ones for
firefighters,'' Boehlert said Tuesday. ``Volunteer fire companies
are people who are farmers, lawyers, they work in the factory and
they volunteer their time and services to the fire department. Now
this regulation, if it's enforced, would require these people to
spend about $400 to get a commercial license ... when there's no
evidence whatsoever that firefighters are creating any safety
problems on our nation's highways.''
   Federal legislation introduced last week in the House by Rep.
Jim Slattery, D-Kan., and the Senate by Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb.,
would exempt the drivers of fire trucks and farm vehicles that are
driven less than 15,000 miles a year.
   Francis A. McGarry, New York state fire administrator, estimated
that it would cost $58 million to commercially license 95,000 of
the state's 165,000 firefighters.
   He put test fees at $350, a physical exam at about $150, ``and
that's without even including the time a volunteer has to take off
from work to go and do this.''

   A 40-year-old bomb exploded and killed a boy and
two other people in central Henan province when the boy tried to
open it, thinking the explosives inside had medicinal value, the
official China Daily said today.
   It said Wei Shuangxi, a farmer living near Sanmenxia city, found
the bomb while digging for medicinal herbs last year.
   On Feb. 19, a boy playing at Wei's home tried to chop the end
off the bomb, thinking the explosives inside could cure diseases,
and the bomb went off, killing the boy, Wei and one other person,
the newspaper said.
   The report gave no details of the bomb. Forty years ago, the
Communist Red Army and the Nationalists were waging a civil war
that ended in 1949 with the Communist forces gaining control of the
mainland.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, buoyed by a big turnout in
the heavily black Delta, sailed to a decisive victory in
Mississippi's presidential primary, while Vice President George
Bush blew away other GOP challengers like a gulf hurricane.
   Voters on Tuesday also set up a November matchup of two popular
congressmen for the seat of retiring Sen. John C. Stennis.
   With 2,268 of 2,340 precincts or 97 percent reporting, Jackson
had 162,431 or 45 percent and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had
120,708 or 33 percent. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had
31,188 or 9 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 19,811
votes or 5 percent; and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 12,748
votes or 4 percent.
   In the Republican race, with 2,249 of 2,340 precincts or 96
percent reporting, Bush had 103,094 votes or 66 percent to Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole's 26,287 or 17 percent. Former TV evangelist Pat
Robertson had 21,017 or 13 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had
5,782 or 4 percent.
   Based on those returns, Jackson would get 23 delegates to 16 for
Gore and one for Dukakis. Bush would secure 27 GOP delegates, with
two each for Dole and Robertson.
   ``We knew we were going to do well ... but we didn't think we'd
do this well overall, or in Mississippi,'' said Eric Kimbrough,
executive director of the state's Bush campaign. ``We believe this
is a resounding victory for us.''
   U.S. Rep. Wayne Dowdy, a Democrat who jumped in the U.S. Senate
race the day after Stennis, 86, retired in October, defeated
Secretary of State Dick Molpus, 38, by a comfortable margin.
Stennis is retiring after 41 years in the Senate.
   Polls rate a contest between liberal Dowdy and conservative
Republican Trent Lott a toss-up.
   ``It will take a united Democratic Party to beat him,'' Dowdy
said. ``It can be won, and things are ripe for the Democrats to win
in November. Mississippi should have at least one Democrat in the
U.S. Senate.''
   Early polls had shown Dowdy, 44, trailing Molpus, who recently
won re-election to a new four-year statehouse term. The two tussled
over Dowdy's voting record, which Molpus said was among the five
poorest based on attendance in the House.
   ``I think that hurt me a little, and it hurt him a little, too,
but going into the final days we felt very confident,'' Dowdy said.
``We said we would get about 55 percent, and that's the way it
turned out.''
   In lightly contested Democratic primaries, 24-term Rep. Jamie
Whitten and Mike Espy, the state's first black congressman since
reconstruction, were overwhelming winners.
   Runoffs appeared certain in both parties for the 4th and 5th
District seats given up by Dowdy and Lott, respectively. They will
be held March 29.

   Five self-proclaimed lesbians were arrested for
chaining themselves to Buckingham Palace's gates to protest the
government's plan to stop giving public funds to homosexual groups.
   Police cut the women free from the gates after a half-hour and
took them into custody.
   The demonstrators said their action Tuesday coincided with the
70th anniversary of suffragettes doing the same in the campaign to
win votes for women. Twelve female supporters, some in Victorian
clothing, paraded on the sidewalk.
   The demonstration was against a government bill that would make
local councils stop funding homosexual groups or promoting
homosexuality as a legitimate lifestyle.
   ``We chose the palace because the bill will have to gain royal
assent next month before it becomes law,'' said one of the women,
who refused to give her name.

   Vice President George Bush's lopsided
victory in Kentucky's GOP primary surprised even his staunchest
supporters, while Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. also won big in
his neighbor state.
   Bush captured 71,912 votes, or 59 percent of the GOP total
Tuesday, according to unofficial returns with 3,235 of 3,237
precincts, or 99 percent, reporting. The vote apparently won 27 of
the 38 delegates up for grabs.
   ``I think Bush is unstoppable after this. I think he clinched
the presidency today,'' said U.S. Rep. Harold Rogers, Bush's state
campaign chairman, who said he had predicted Bush would win 48
percent of the vote.
   Kansas Sen. Robert Dole finished second with 27,844 votes, 23
percent of the total. He apparently won 11 delegates.
   No other Republican crossed the 15 percent threshold to win any
delegates.
   With 3,241 of 3,243 Democratic precincts reporting, Gore
received 150,286 votes, or 46 percent. Because of the way delegates
are apportioned, though, he apparently won 37 of the 55 available
Democratic delegates, or 67 percent.
   ``Al Gore is right for Kentucky; he's right for America. We're
just now starting the momentum in this campaign,'' said Gov.
Wallace Wilkinson, Gore's leading supporter in the state.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ran second in Kentucky with
59,457 votes, or 18 percent, and was slated for 12 delegates.
   Only the Jesse Jackson among other Democrats was able to make
the threshold and win delegates. Jackson received 49,655 votes, or
15 percent, to earn six delegates.
   Among other Republicans, former TV evangelist Pat Robertson
received 13,538 votes, or 11 percent. No other Republican broke 2
percent.
   Missouri Congressman Richard Gephardt received 29,048 votes, or
9 percent. No other Democrat received more than 4 percent.

<HEAD>Near Sweep Of Black Voters For Jesse Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson built his triumphs in the
South's Super Tuesday primaries by piling a 10 percent share of the
white vote on top of a near sweep of black votes.
   It was Jackson's finest hour in two runs for the presidency and
he said it gave him ``a sense of joy ... and a sense of victory.''
   ``We're now in a dead-heat contest running for the nomination of
our party,'' he told ABC News from Houston Tuesday night. ``It
shows that America is getting stronger and better, but also that in
the South, my message began to break through: stop drugs, save jobs
and invest in our children.''
   Jackson demonstrated anew what he had shown earlier in such
states as Iowa, Maine and Vermont, where only a tiny share of the
population is black: he is now able to attract a significant share
of white votes.
   He has also benefited from changes in the party delegate
selection rules he complained so bitterly about in 1984, when he
won 18 percent of the popular vote but wound up with only 12
percent of the delegates.
   And this time out, Jackson didn't have to share the black vote
with Walter Mondale.
   Blacks made up nearly 25 percent of the electorate in the South,
and exit polls by ABC News indicated Jackson got 95 percent or more
of their votes.
   ABC polls said Jackson had about 10 percent of the white vote in
the South, while the CBS News-New York Times poll said he had 8
percent. NBC figures ranged from 4 percent in Tennessee to 15
percent in Virginia and 19 percent in Massachusetts.
   At a virtually all-black precinct in Mobile County, Ala.,
Jackson got 1,837 votes to second-place Albert Gore Jr.'s 31. In
Macon County, about 90 percent black, Jackson led with 2,540 to
Gore's 43.
   Overall, according to ABC's polls, Jackson got 6 percent of the
white Alabama vote and 96 percent of the black vote. By comparison,
four years earlier, Jackson got 1 percent of the white vote and 55
percent of the black vote in Alabama.
   Likewise, in Florida, where Jackson managed 1 percent of the
white vote and 58 percent of the black vote in 1984, he pulled in 7
percent of the white vote and 82 percent of the black vote Tuesday,
said ABC. Its exit polls had a 5-point margin of error in either
direction.
   Frank Dexter Brown, associate director of communications for the
Joint Center for Political Studies, a black-oriented think tank
based in Washington, said Tuesday Jackson has been defying
expectations all along this year with his showings in New England,
Minnesota and Iowa.
   Jackson got 28 percent of the vote in Maine compared to 1
percent four years earlier. He also got 28 percent in Vermont, 20
percent in a second-place finish in Minnesota, 11 percent in the
Iowa caucuses and 8 percent in New Hampshire.
   Most national polls have given Jackson 4 percent to 5 percent of
the white vote.
   A survey last August by the Joint Center for Political Studies
found 80 percent of blacks and 10 percent of whites supported
Jackson.
   Blacks comprise about 11 percent of all Americans of voting age.
   Since delegates are awarded by congressional district, not
statewide, it is still possible for a candidate to wind up with a
smaller share of delegates in some states than his popular vote.
   But Jackson stood to profit from the lower threshold of votes
needed in each congressional district to gain delegates. It was 20
percent in 1984; now it is 15 percent.
   Voters polled by ABC gave Jackson high marks for his ability to
handle foreign affairs, protect the poor and elderly and hold down
unemployment.
   Among those who voted in Democratic primaries, 29 percent said
they definitely would not vote for Jackson for president; 45
percent nixed Republican Pat Robertson; 37 percent ruled out George
Bush and 36 percent said no to Democrat Gary Hart. His three main
Democratic rivals, Michael Dukakis, Gore and Richard Gephardt, were
ruled out by 12 percent to 14 percent.

   Vice President George Bush declared Tuesday, ``I'm going to be
the next president of the United States,'' as he overwhelmed Sen.
Bob Dole in lopsided Republican voting. Dole sought to deflect the
shock while the presidential aspirations of Jack Kemp and Pat
Robertson were dealt shattering blows.
   Robertson kept Bush from a Super Tuesday shutout, winning the
Washington caucuses.
   But it was a small loss for Bush, who was triumphant in the 16
remaining states that held GOP primaries Tuesday.
   Bush was leading for 571 of the 712 delegates up for grabs.
   ``This is a unique political happening,'' an elated Bush told
cheering campaign workers in Houston. ``It exceeded my fondest
expectations.''
   A more subdued Dole told his supporters in Chicago: ``Tomorrow
we will be on the road to recovery.''
   Dole, shutout in the South, turned his sights north, to the
Illinois primary next Tuesday, where he hoped to stage a comeback.
``I want to congratulate the vice president ... He'll probably
sleep better tonight than I will,'' he said. ``We'll take turns.''
   Dole's campaign chairman, William Brock, acknowledged that the
campaign had suffered a serious defeat. ``The psychological hit is
very heavy,'' he said.
   Tuesday's voting appeared to put the other two GOP candidates,
Kemp and Robertson, well out of contention for the party nomination.
   Robertson continued to show strength in state caucuses with his
win in Washington. He vowed to fight on.
   ``It isn't too bad for an amateur, but it's not near what I
expected,'' Robertson said. He suggested he might win the Illinois
primary and asserted, ``I do have resources left. We have the
largest donor base of any candidate and I can carry all the way to
New Orleans.''
   Robertson offered his congratulations to Bush and said, ``He ran
a superb campaign.''
   Bush won decisive victories all over, capturing more than 50
percent of the vote in many states, including delegate-rich Florida
and Texas.
   The vice president also scored big wins in Tennessee, Kentucky,
Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, North
Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In Oklahoma and
Missouri, the margin was much closer, but Bush hung on to win..
   Dole had pinned his Southern hopes on North Carolina, the home
state of his wife, Elizabeth.
   At stake Tuesday were 712 delegates to the Republican National
Convention. Virginia was alone among the 17 GOP contests holding a
``beauty contest'' that awards no delegates. It takes 1,139 votes
for the nomination.
   Bush led for 571, giving him 698 when combined with the
delegates he won in earlier contests. Dole led for 100, a total of
165. Robertson was getting 10 for a total 18. Kemp led for 4 for a
total 39.
   Bush's national campaign chairman, Lee Atwater, predicted that
Bush would pick up more than 600 delegates _ a gain that would give
him a near-unassailable lead toward winning the GOP presidential
nomination.
   ``I would certainly hate to be in Sen. Dole's shoes after
tonight and especially if he loses in Illinois,'' Atwater said.
   The Dole campaign had sought to keep Bush from picking up more
than 500 delegates.
   Dole hoped to wage a come-from-behind effort in Midwestern and
Western states. He said earlier in Springfield, Ill., ``If we take
a little bath today, I am going to start my road to recovery in
Illinois just like I did 40 years ago.''
   He was referring to his recuperation in an Illinois hospital
from wounds suffered during World War II.
   Kemp and Robertson were far outdistanced by Bush and Dole. Kemp
trailed Robertson in most Southern states, and was expected to drop
out by week's end. For Robertson, the voting throughout the South
was a replay of his third place finish in Saturday's South Carolina
primary, when he could muster no more than about 20 percent of the
vote.
   Bush voted in Houston, and then told reporters, ``If we exceed
our expectations or live up to them, I think we'll be in good
shape.''
   ``It's going to be a little tougher as we go along, but I've
been in tough fights before,'' Dole acknowledged at a morning news
conference in Kansas City, Mo.
   He then traveled to Illinois and immediately challenged Bush to
a series of debates _ ``one-on-one, without moderator'' _ in that
state, which holds its primary next Tuesday.
   ``If Bob Dole was so serious about debating, he would have shown
up for the (Feb. 19) Dallas Morning News debate,'' Bush spokesman
Pete Teeley said. ``We have a strategy which has been highly
successful and we plan to pursue it, and that doesn't include
having one-on-one debates with Bob Dole.''
   The Senate minority leader, a 1980 presidential contender and
GOP vice presidential candidate in 1976, was reportedly spending
$500,000 on television advertising in Illinois.
   A defeat there could all but end Dole's presidential efforts and
a strong showing for the Kanasan was by no means assured. Bush is
backed by Illinois Gov. James Thompson and 93 of the state's 102
Republican county chairmen.
   Kemp, dead last in the South Carolina primary last weekend, had
not been expected to see that flagging effort revived in Tuesday's
voting. Aides said the New York lawmaker and former pro-football
star would reassess his race later in the week. He was expected to
pull out.
   Robertson's chances as a serious contender seemed likely to be
all but ended if his losses in Super Tuesday states were as
decisive as his third-place finish in South Carolina, where he won
only 19 percent of the vote.
   Robertson's candidacy came to life with his strong second-place
finish the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8. But in the primaries that
followed, his strength ebbed.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police fired birdshot and tear
gas to disperse demonstrators who blocked streets with hundreds of
trash fires to protest the country's military rule and its
tottering economy.
   The demonstrations Tuesday were the largest since President Eric
Arturo Delvalle was deposed Feb. 26, just hours after he tried to
fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, chief of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces, is
considered the real power behind the country's civilian government.
   Reporters saw at least eight protesters captured, beaten with
rubber truncheons and fists and driven away in military vehicles.
   A photographer for the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior was
slightly injured by birdshot fired by police.
   The National Civic Crusade, which has organized demonstrations
calling for Noriega's ouster since last June, said at least 23
people were detained. By late Tuesday, all but two had been
released.
   ``It was another black day for Panama,'' said Aurelio Barria,
president of the Panama Chamber of Commerce, Industry and
Agriculture. ``When the people of Panama go into the streets, they
get repressed,'' he told reporters Tuesday night.
   ``We are in the hands of armed terrorists,'' Barria added,
referring to the Noriega regime.
   Barria is a director of the Crusade, a broad coalition of
business, professional, labor, student and political organizations
opposed to Noriega.
   Small groups of protesters erected barricades across hundreds of
streets in the central and eastern parts of the city Tuesday
afternoon, snarling traffic and forcing many businesses to shut
down early.
   Riot police were out in force, but they could not keep up with
the hundreds of demonstrators, many of whom stepped out of their
homes and shops to hurl plastic bags of garbage into the streets
then quickly ran back inside.
   Other protesters, mostly roving bands of youths, set fire to
piles of debris and built barricades of burning tires, dry palm
fronds, wooden signs, boulders and anything else they could lug
into the streets.
   Some tried to throw rocks at police but could not reach their
targets. When police appeared, groups ran a few blocks then set up
another barricade.
   The stench of burning garbage and the acrid smell of tear gas
wafted over large parts of the city as the demonstrations, and the
government's attempts to halt them, continued into the evening.
   Smouldering rubbish still littered the streets of this tropical
capital late Tuesday night, but demonstrators had dispersed.
   The protests came on the seventh day of a bank shutdown that has
crippled commerce. Most businesses were not accepting checks or
credit cards, only cash.
   Depositors began a run on Panamanian-owned and -operated banks
the day Delvalle was dismissed.
   The 12 locally owned banks closed March 1 during a nationwide
general strike called by Noriega's opponents. The banks opened
briefly but the government ordered them shut again last Thursday
because of a lack of cash.
   In Miami, a U.S. district judge froze Panamanian assets in banks
there after a suit was filed Tuesday to prevent Noriega's
government from withdrawing official monies. A similar order was
issued last week in New York City and another suit was filed
Tuesday in Boston.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle as Panama's
president. It has been calling for Noriega's removal since his
indictment in Florida in February on federal drug trafficking
charges.
   Delvalle has been in hiding in Panama since Noriega orchestrated
his ouster by the Legislative Assembly.
   Jorge Abadia, Panama's foreign minister, on Tuesday accused the
United States of conducting ``the prelude of an armed invasion'' by
staging military exercises along the Panama Canal.
   But the U.S. Southern Command said the exercises, involving
nearly 700 soldiers from U.S. military installations in Panama and
U.S. National Guard troops from Florida and Puerto Rico, were
scheduled a year ago. The command said the exercises, which began
last weekend, are ``routine training.''
   Dennis McAuliffe, administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,
said on Tuesday that the waterway was operating normally despite
the strain that the tension between the United States and Panama
has created for canal workers.

   Support from key Democratic figures pushed
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. past Jesse Jackson in North
Carolina's presidential primary, while victorious Vice President
George Bush stressed his ties to President Reagan.
   Gore's victory Tuesday showed voters ``trusted him on defense,
believed he was committed to jobs and economic growth, and they
trusted him to be fiscally responsible,'' said former Gov. Jim
Hunt, who with Sen. Terry Sanford endorsed Gore in January.
   With 2,373 of 2,387 precincts or 99 percent reporting, Gore had
234,595 votes or 35 percent; Jackson had 222,494 votes or 33
percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 136,459 votes or 20
percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 37,854 votes or 6
percent, and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 16,506 votes or 2
percent.
   In the Republican race, with 2,374 of 2,387 precincts or 99
percent reporting: Bush had 123,781 votes or 45 percent; Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole had 109,678 votes or 40 percent; former television
evangelist Pat Robertson had 26,583 votes or 10 percent, and New
York Rep. Jack Kemp had 11,348 votes or 4 percent.
   Gore was expected to take 34 of the state's 82 Democratic
delegates, with Jackson getting 31 and Dukakis 17. Bush was
expected to take 29 of the state's 54 delegates and Dole 25.
   Bush held off a late surge by Dole, who targeted North Carolina
in his effort to avoid a Southern shutout. During an all-day swing
across the state Saturday, Bush said he was worried because polls
had indicated the contest was neck-and-neck.
   The popularity of Dole's wife, former transportation secretary
Elizabeth Dole, in her native state helped but not enough,
observers said. ``You have to remember that Mrs. Dole is not on the
ticket,'' said Joan Shaffer, co-chairman of Bush's Wake County
organization.
   ``A Republican candidate has to carry the South,'' said Jack
Hawke, the state GOP chairman. ``What George Bush has shown is that
he is strong in the South. ... People are associating him with the
president.''

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Trounce Opposition In Rhode Island</HEAD>

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Vice President George Bush built vigorous campaigns on already
strong personal ties to score resounding victories in Rhode
Island's presidential primaries.
   ``Our mission has been accomplished,'' said Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete, who repaid Bush's campaign journeys to the state with
strong backing. ``There is really a Bush blastout tonight all over
the country.''
   Bush, a New England native, swept his chief rival, Kansas Sen.
Bob Dole, in 16 states around the country in the Super Tuesday
primaries.
   In the Democratic race, with 100 percent of 320 precincts
reporting, Dukakis amassed 34,159 votes or 70 percent, making his
victory even bigger than that of another Bay Stater, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, in the 1980 primary.
   Jesse Jackson was a distant second with 7,369 votes or 15
percent, followed by Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt with 2,013
votes or 4 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. with 1,932 votes
or 4 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 1,392 votes or 3
percent and Gary Hart with 738 votes or 2 percent.
   Among Republicans, with 319 of 320 precincts or 99 percent
reporting, Bush won 10,403 votes or 65 percent, trailed by Dole
with 3,637 votes or 23 percent; Pat Robertson with 921 votes or 6
percent and Rep. Jack Kemp, 783 votes or 5 percent.
   Based on those results, Bush would likely capture 15 GOP
delegates and Dole would win six, while Dukakis would gain 19
Democratic delegates and Jackson three.
   Dukakis, as the governor of a neighboring state, was a familiar
face to Rhode Islanders long before he began running for president.
He campaigned here several times and quickly picked up support from
most of Rhode Island's Democratic hierarchy.
   Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., state chairman of the
Dukakis campaign, said the governor's win was even more impressive
than Kennedy's victory over President Carter in the 1980 Democratic
primary.
   Kennedy ``had about 65 to 67 percent of the vote in a two-man
race,'' Paolino said. ``This is a five-man race.''
   Jackson supporters broke out champagne to celebrate their
candidate's strong showing in a state that is only 2 percent black.

<HEAD>Amnesty Accuses Forces Under Philippines Government In Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today accused Philippines
forces under President Corazon Aquino's government of unlawfully
killing left-wing foes and people suspected of supporting that
nation's 19-year communist insurgency.
   The London-based human rights organization called on the Aquino
government to end the killings by military and paramilitary forces,
saying the slayings represented the Philippines' most serious human
rights problem since mid-1987.
   There was no immediate response from the Aquino government.
   Last month the president accused the communists of using charges
of human rights abuses as a smokescreen to discredit the military
and draw attention away from rebel actions.
   In Manila today, Task Force-Detainees _ a private, social
activist group supported by the Roman Catholic Church _ said the
number of illegal arrests in the Philippines had increased since
the February 1986 collapse of President Ferdinand Marcos'
authoritarian regime.
   Spokesman Noel Salazar said his group's investigations showed
that 7,444 people were illegally detained or arrested in 1987, and
of that number 602 were tortured. He said that in 1985, the last
full year of the Marcos administration, 5,967 people were illegally
detained.
   Mrs. Aquino promised to restore human rights when she succeeded
Marcos on Feb. 25, 1986, after a military-civilian uprising drove
Marcos into exile.
   The Amnesty report said most victims were singled out because
they either belonged to legal, left-wing organizations or were
suspected of backing the New People's Army, the armed wing of the
Communist Party of the Philippines.
   It said their killers belonged to the regular military and
police forces, paramilitary civil defense forces and
community-based vigilante groups acting with government support.
   The Aquino government has sanctioned formation of more than 200
civilian anti-Communist vigilante groups, some of which have forged
alliances with armed religious fanatics, or Tadtads. Many of the
vigilante groups have been armed by the military. Church and human
rights organizations have accused the vigilantes of murder,
intimidation and other abuses.
   Amnesty said it did not know of one military or police officer
who was convicted and sentenced for such political killings or for
any other serious human rights offense since Mrs. Aquino assumed
office.
   It praised the Aquino government for ``some very real progress''
in human rights, particularly in restoring legal safeguards and in
greatly reducing the use of torture. But it called on the
government to reaffirm publicly its commitment to protect human
rights.
   Many killings reported to Amnesty followed acts of violence by
communist rebels in which civilians and military personnel were
killed, the report said.
   It argued that crimes by opposition groups ``can never be used
to justify unlawful retaliatory killings by agents of the
government'' supposed to uphold the law.
   Amnesty cited scores of cases of Filipino men, women and
children shot to death since mid-1987.
   Among the cases cited were:
   _17 villagers, including six children, killed by soldiers in
February 1987 in apparent reprisal after troops were ambushed in
Lupao, Nueva Ecija province.
   _A 29-year-old peasant activist, his wife and two small
children, hacked to death after masked members of a civil defense
unit were seen entering their home in Magpet, North Cotobato, in
May 1987.
   _A 28-year-old farm worker, mutilated and beheaded in front of a
neighbor by members of a vigilante group in Kabankalan in Southern
Negros Occidental in June 1987.
   The report said the Aquino government responded swiftly to many
highly publicized killings by setting up task forces to conduct
official inquiries. It said many less well-known cases were handled
by the Commission on Human Rights or its predecessor.
   But Amnesty said official investigations of such killings rarely
led to prosecutions for reasons that included fear on the part of
witnesses, lack of cooperation from the military and apparent lack
of impartiality by military courts, which have jurisdiction over
cases involving soldiers and police.
   Amnesty expressed concern about occasional reports of torture
and about the fate of campaigners for left-wing political parties
who disappeared after allegedly being abducted by military
personnel following May 1986 congressional elections.

   The Super Tuesday primaries produced a
blizzard of numbers. Here are some figures from exit polls
conducted by ABC News in a dozen Southern states that help provide
a snapshot of who voted how:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEMOCRATS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ White voters were narrowly split between Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore Jr., 34 percent to 33 percent. But Jesse Jackson's 10
percent share of the white vote helped him roll to victory in
several deep South states.
   _ Black voters favored Jackson by margins of 95 percent or
higher.
   _ Hispanics gave 42 percent of their votes to Dukakis, 23
percent to Jackson.
   _ Protestants favored Gore over Jackson, 31 percent to 27
percent.
   _ Catholics went with Dukakis by 45 percent to Jackson's 16
percent.
   _ Jewish voters picked Dukakis by 78 percent to Gore's 11
percent. Jackson had three percent of the Jewish vote, as did
Richard Gephardt.
   _ Born-again Christians picked Jackson by 40 percent to Gore's
29 percent. But among only white born-again Christians, Gore got 46
percent to Dukakis's 22 percent and Jackson's eight percent.
Jackson got 96 percent of the black born-again vote. Evangelicals
sided with Dukakis, 27 percent, over Gore, 22 percent, and Jackson,
21 percent.
   _ About a third of Democratic primary voters in the South had
pulled the lever for Ronald Reagan in 1984. They favored Gore (35
percent) over Dukakis (25 percent), Gephardt (15 percent) and
Jackson (12 percent).
   _ Pat Robertson was the candidate with the highest negatives
among Democratic voters. Forty-five percent said they definitely
would not vote for him. Thirty-seven percent expressed the same
sentiment about George Bush, 36 percent about Gary Hart and 29
percent about Jackson.
   _ Eighty-two percent of Democratic voters said the next
president should change the course set by Reagan; among them, 33
percent were for Jackson, 29 percent Dukakis and 22 percent Gore.
Among the 18 percent who want the next president to follow Reagan's
course, 38 percent were for Gore, 21 percent for Dukakis and 16
percent for Jackson.
   _ Dukakis commanded 75 percent of the Greek-American vote, and
70 percent of the Italian-Americans.
   _ Forty-seven percent of farmers went for Dukakis; so did 39
percent of the feminists.
   _ Five percent of the voters were from union households.
Thirty-seven percent of them went for Jackson, 31 percent for
Dukakis and 22 percent for Gore.
   _ Nearly a quarter said the national economy was the overriding
issue, and they went with Dukakis by 35 percent to 24 percent for
Jackson and 20 percent for Gore.

<HEAD>REPUBLICANS;</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The youngest voters and those in their 50s were George Bush's
biggest supporters. Those age 18-24 favored Bush over Dole by 73
percent to 11 percent, while those in their 50s picked him by 65
percent to 14 percent.
   _ Dole's worst showing was among high school graduates and
dropouts, where he trailed Bush by 60-17; his best was among those
with more than four years of college, where he narrowed the gap to
50-33.
   _ Among Protestants, Bush beat Dole 58-21, with Robertson
claiming 17 percent and Kemp 3 percent. Among Catholics, Bush
trounced Dole, 72-21, with Kemp getting 6 percent.
   _ Among born-again Christians, Bush beat Robertson, 46-33, with
Dole third at 14 percent and Kemp at 5 percent. Among white
born-agains, Bush was the choice, 44-34, over Robertson. Among
evangelicals, Bush was the choice by 48-28 over Dole, with
Robertson third at 18 percent and Kemp last at 5 percent.
   _ Among the five percent of Republican voters who owned up to
voting for Walter Mondale in 1984, Dole was the choice by 33-30
over Bush, with Robertson at 17 percent and Kemp at 13 percent.
   _ Among Reagan voters, Bush walloped Dole, 62-19, with Robertson
getting 14 percent and Kemp 4 percent.
   _ Robertson got eight percent of the votes of those who called
themselves liberals or moderates, but 16 percent of the
conservatives. His conservative votes came at Dole's expense.
   _ Robertson was near the top of the Republican voters' list of
candidates they definitely would not vote for. Forty-two percent
mentioned Hart; 41 percent said Robertson and Jackson; 23 percent
Simon and 21 percent Dukakis.
   _ Seventy-nine percent wanted to stay the Reagan course; they
favored Bush 64-17 over Dole, with 13 percent for Robertson and 5
percent for Dole. Among the 21 percent who want a change, Bush led
Dole 47-38, with 10 percent for Robertson and 3 percent for Kemp.
   _ Republican voters from union households picked Dole with 56
percent over Bush and Robertson, both 22 percent.
   _ Among those who considered the candidates' stands on abortion
crucial, Robertson tied Bush with 40 percent.
   _ Eighty percent of Jews went for Bush, 20 percent for Dole.
   The ABC exit polls had a standard margin of error of five points
in either direction. ABC interviewed voters as they exited 690
precincts around the Super Tuesday states. It questioned at least
1,000 voters in each Republican primary state and 700 in the
Democratic primaries.
   Many of these results were based on an extended questionnaire
given to voters at 50 precincts across the South.

   Pat Robertson, supported by troops of energetic
fundamentalists, marched to his sole Super Tuesday victory by
pushing past Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush in
Washington state's Republican caucuses.
   With 3,683 of 6,594 precincts reporting, the former TV
evangelist picked up 4,659 votes or 38 percent. Dole had 3,245 or
27 percent, and Bush came in third _ his only loss of the night _
with 2,958 or 24 percent.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp was a weak fourth with 906 or 7 percent.
   ``We'll take it!'' Robertson's state organizer, Bruce Hawkins,
cried as the results rolled in.
   To claim their share of the state's 41 GOP delegates, the
candidates will have to fare as well in this spring's county or
legislative district caucuses, which precede the July 15 state
convention where delegates will be allocated.
   State Republican chairwoman Jennifer Dunn said the proportions
set caucus night traditionally hold up throughout the delegate
selection process.
   In early results for the Democrats, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, endorsed by Gov. Booth Gardner, had 45 percent and Jesse
Jackson 32 percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. received the
votes of 7 percent of those Democrats represented in the party's
sample of statewide precinct voting. Ten percent were undecided.
   At stake were 73 Democratic delegates. However, final Democratic
results were not expected for a week.
   As many as 220,000 registered voters, or 10 percent of those
eligible, were expected to take part in caucuses that represented
the first step toward electing the West's second largest bloc of
national convention delegates.

<TEXT>
   Super Tuesday rocked the presidential
aspirations of Bob Dole and Richard Gephardt, who just a month ago
were basking in their first-place victories in the Iowa caucuses.
   It also appeared to claim at least one immediate casualty,
Republican Jack Kemp, whose expected withdrawal from the race could
come as early as today. The future of Democrat Gary Hart's campaign
also seemed dim.
   Republican Dole and Democrat Gephardt vowed to press on. But
both were clearly shaken by poor showings in the largest-ever round
of primary contests.
   ``I never told you it was going to be easy,'' Gephardt said
after winning only his home state of Missouri.
   ``I don't give up very easily,'' said Dole, who came away from
Super Tuesday with no wins and few delegates.
   Republican Pat Robertson and Democrat Paul Simon also said they
would stay in the race, at least for now, despite disappointing
showings in their respective primary races on Tuesday.
   Robertson _ who consistently beat only Kemp throughout the
native South that he claimed as his base of support _ said he
``didn't frankly have the concentration I should have had in key
states.'' He didn't come close in any of the 16 GOP primaries, but
did win Washington's caucuses.
   But the former television evangelist, who three weeks ago told a
New Hampshire audience ``I assure you that I am going to be the
next president,'' said his Super Tuesday showing ``isn't too bad
for an amateur.''
   He said, ``I do have resources left. We have the largest donor
base of any candidate and I can carry all the way to New Orleans''
to the Republican convention this summer.
   Democrat Simon was expected to hold on, at least until the
primary next week in his home state of Illinois. He largely stayed
away from Super Tuesday races and declared the outcome a
``gridlock'' with ``no clear winner.''
   ``No candidate is going to win on the first ballot at the
(Democratic) convention,'' Simon suggested. ``It's going to be a
brokered convention.''
   Hart was on the ballot but out of the presidential picture in
all primary states. He failed to get more than single-digit
percentages anywhere.
   But Hart, who declared ``let the people decide'' when he
re-entered the race last December, made no public comment on his
future plans.
   He had said last week that ``so long as I can be treated
seriously, I will continue.'' Hart listened to the returns on
television at his home outside of Denver.
   Dole, who was crushed by Bush in a sweep across the South that
netted the vice president close to 700 new delegates, hoped to make
a comeback effort in the Midwestern and Western primaries that
follow _ beginning with next Tuesday's contest in Illinois.
   ``Tomorrow we will be on the road to recovery,'' Dole told a
group of supporters in Chicago.
   ``I want to congratulate the vice president. ... He'll probably
sleep better tonight than I will,'' Dole added. ``We'll take
turns.''
   A Dole defeat in Illinois could give Bush a nearly unassailable
lead and could all but end Dole's chances for the GOP presidential
nomination.
   Gephardt also sought to look beyond the losses.
   ``Now we go on, to Illinois, to Michigan ... '' he said.
Gephardt claimed, ``I'm far from chucking it in because this is a
long race.''
   Kemp spent the evening with his family in suburban Washington
rather than with supporters.
   The 52-year old former pro quarterback, who had earlier sought
to portray himself as a ``consensus conservative'' who could carry
on the Reagan Revolution, had failed to see his candidacy take off.
   His withdrawal from the race appeared inevitable after his
fourth-place finish in South Carolina last weekend.
   Out of cash, Kemp decided to make one last stand in the Super
Tuesday contests. But in only a single primary, Massachusetts, did
he finish any better than fourth. There he edged out Robertson for
third place.

   The dollar rose slightly in Tokyo on Wednesday,
while stock prices gained substantially following an overnight

   The dollar closed at 128.08 yen, up 0.28 yen from Tuesday's

1.3 billion shares.
   Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage
house, said Tokyo stock prices were supported by Tuesday's rally on
the New York Stock Exchange and by stabilization of the foreign
exchange market.
   Investors also appeared to be buying shares deemed to be at
bargain prices after the Tokyo market's decline on Tuesday, dealers
said.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis used a
strong local organization to smash Democratic rivals in Maryland's
presidential primary, while Vice President George Bush won without
even campaigning in person.
   ``We were well organized today. We were the only candidate
really to have extensive poll coverage,'' said Baltimore County
Executive Dennis Rasmussen, one of the organization Democrats
involved in the Dukakis campaign.
   With 1,459 of 1,574 precincts or 93 percent reporting today,
Dukakis had 193,258 votes or 43 percent; Jesse Jackson had 140,025
votes or 31 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 40,061
votes or 9 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 34,170 votes
or 8 percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 13,628 votes or 3
percent.
   In the Republican race, with 1,548 of 1,574 precincts or 98
percent reporting, Bush had 103,899 votes or 53 percent; Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole had 62,721 votes or 32 percent; Pat Robertson had
12,328 votes or 6 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 11,579
votes or 6 percent.
   Dukakis was expected to take 27 delegates and Jackson 20. Bush
grabbed the state's 41 Republican delegates.
   Also on the ballot, incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes
easily won nomination for a third term. He will be opposed in the
general election by millionaire businessman Thomas Blair, a
newcomer to politics.
   Bush carried all eight congressional districts even though he
didn't campaign personally in Maryland. Dole spent less than one
day in the state.
   Dukakis benefitted from strong Democratic organizational
support, especially in the populous suburbs around Baltimore and
Washington, D.C.
   U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, Jackson's state chairman, said Dukakis
``ran a good campaign, had a good organization, had a good message,
and people latched onto it.''
   But he said he felt good about Jackson's showing, which was
boosted by strong support in the state's two predominantly black
congressional districts.
   ``The campaign strategy was really to hold onto what we had in
1984 and to slightly increase it, and so we've done better than
that,'' Mfume said. ``Jesse Jackson and Dukakis both were organized
in Maryland. They spent time here, and the voters responded
accordingly.''

Defeat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
reeling from Super Tuesday losses, says he is ``on the road to
recovery'' in Illinois and that the industrial Midwest will revive
his struggling campaign.
   ``This is going to be Bob Dole's recovery state,'' the Kansas
senator told a crowd of cheering supporters Tuesday night.
   ``It's going to be the turnaround state. It's going to get us
back on the winning track.''
   After Dole's losses in Tuesday's primaries and caucuses, the
March 15 Illinois primary is a make-or-break event for the
senator's candidacy, his aides concede.
   ``We've got to make it happen in Illinois,'' said Thomas D.
Rath, a senior strategist in the campaign.
   Although polls indicate that Vice President George Bush leads
Dole in Illinois, Rath said, the campaign hopes to surge ahead by
focusing on what has become a dominant theme _ Dole's leadership in
the Senate and contrasting that to Bush's record.
   ``If you're looking for somebody who understands the issues,
somebody who deals with the issues every day and somebody who has
made a difference, you can pretty well judge a candidate by what
they've done in the past,'' Dole told supporters in Oak Brook, a
Chicago suburb where he watched the Super Tuesday results on
television.
   The Dole campaign is counting on strong support in downstate
farming areas and in Republican counties near the Illinois-Missouri
border. In addition, the campaign is targeting white-collar
suburban areas around Chicago.
   William Brock, Dole's campaign chairman, acknowledged that
Tuesday's losses dealt a serious blow to the Dole campaign.
   ``The psychological hit is very heavy,'' said Brock.
   Brock attributed Bush's victories to President Reagan's
popularity in the South, and expressed frustration that the Dole
campaign had not been able to make gains by attacking Bush and
focusing the campaign on issues such as the deficit and drug use in
America.
   ``You do the best you can. We did not have time to develop the
one-on-one message that we did in the earlier states,'' Brock said.
``Now we've got a little more time. We'll see if we can do a better
job.''
   On arriving in Illinois on Tuesday, Dole immediately took aim at
Bush when he spoke at a rally at the state Capitol in Springfield,
challenging the vice president to a series of debates.
   Later Tuesday, when it became clear he had suffered a big
defeat, Dole rallied his supporters by recalling that he had come
to Chicago 40 years ago for treatment by a surgeon for crippling
wounds suffered in World War II.
   ``I've been coming to Illinois for a long, long time,'' Dole
said. ``I don't give up very easily. We're going to be on the road
to recovery in the state of Illinois.''

<HEAD>Albany Newspapers To Combine Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of the Albany Knickerbocker News,
an afternoon daily with declining circulation, announced plans to
combine it with the larger morning Times Union as a single all-day
newspaper.
   The Knickerbocker News will be discontinued on April 16,
executives of Capital Newspapers, which operates both papers, said
Tuesday. The company is a division of the Hearst Newspapers group.
   William Clemens, general manager of Capital Newspapers, said
demand for the Knickerbocker News was slumping and demand for the
Times Union growing in an area that has five daily newspapers.
   ``We see our resources devoted in two different directions. We
think the best way is to concentrate our resources in one paper,''
he said.
   Clemens said company officials are still working on plans to
combine the workforces of the newspapers, and don't know yet how
many employees may be affected.
   The company declined to release current figures on its
circulation and number of employees.
   Audit Bureau of Circulations figures cited in Editor and
Publisher International Yearbook show that the daily paid
circulation of the Knickerbocker News was 30,699 on Sept. 29, 1986,
compared with 89,049 for the Times Union.
   Two years earlier, the ABC reported audited circulations of
about 35,000 for the Knickerbocker News and 87,000 for the Times
Union.
   Company officials said there will be personnel reductions, but
said they hope to minimize layoffs by depending on attrition and
voluntary measures.

   By day, St. Agnes Boys Catholic High School is
where nearly 300 teen-agers are educated. Hours later, it's a
nocturnal haven for hundreds of homeless in an unusual time-share
concept.
   Many of the boys at St. Agnes, run by the Marist Brothers, come
from some of the city's tougher areas _ Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, the
Lower East Side.
   They gulp down their lunches in the school cafeteria, taking
advantage of the time allotted afterward to play a quick game of
basketball in the gym.
   Worn knapsacks stuffed with books and paper are thrown on the
floor, the mandatory ties are tucked inside the dress shirts, and
the boys are shooting free-throws and trampling the lines painted
on the floor the day before.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _
   A half-day later, noon has turned to midnight and the gym is
still occupied. The boys are gone; replaced by 350 of the city's
estimated 60,000 homeless.
   St. Agnes is transformed into the Grand Central Drop-In Center.
   Folding chairs that had been neatly stacked against the wall in
the day are spread out across the floor. Homeless men are sleeping,
stretching over two or three chairs. The only noise comes from
snoring. A guard is posted outside the door.
   In contrast to the neatly dressed boys here earlier, many of the
men are unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. A few appear to be in poor
health, either physically or mentally.
   Downstairs, in the cafeteria, men and a few women are sitting at
tables talking.
   They will all be out by 5:30 a.m. Two hours and a cleaning crew
later, school will start.

   _
   To hear school officials and the students tell it, no one would
ever know they had overnight company.
   Brother Thomas Schady and Brother Thomas Potenza, principal and
vice-principal, respectively, say there are no remnants of the
shelter program once school begins. And, they say, the cafeteria,
gym and the showers _ all used by night guests _ are clean by
morning.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The nighttime inhabitants stand in line outside the school, then
go through a security checkpoint that includes a metal detector.
Any items that can be construed as weapons _ icepicks, hammers,
knives, scissors _ are dropped off in a box near the door.
   The guests can eat, courtesy of The Salvation Army, and can
shower and sleep on the folding chairs. There is access to social
workers and medical care. There are no beds.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The drop-in center idea is the city's alternative to the usual
shelters. William J. Grinker, commissioner of the city's Human
Resources Administration, has said that for a variety of reasons,
some of the homeless don't use the established shelters.
   The Grand Central Drop-In Center, along with others that will
follow, will provide an option between shelters on the one hand and
bus depots and train stations on the other, Grinker said.
   At the center, one man who declined to give his name said he was
grateful to be inside, away from ``the weather.''
   And 22-year-old Stephanie Frazier said she was relieved to be
away from her usual haunt _ Grand Central Station _ where she has
had to beg for food.
   ``You don't have to beg nobody,'' she said. ``They just walk
past. They don't give you nothin.'''

   The 2-month-old program is welcomed by students.
   ``I think it's kind of cool that the school is helping other
people,'' said 17-year-old Carlos Pinto.
   Similarly, 16-year-old Charles Huller Jr. said: ``We're doing
something good for the homeless. It's part of our duty.''
   And, as Schady pointed out, it is easy to talk to students in a
classroom about reaching out to others _ ``but it's rare to get the
opportunity to experience it.''

one of its officials said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sivinder

defeated Frenchman Yves Lambert, who had held the post for 12 years
and was seeking his fifth three-year term. The election was held
Tuesday.
   Two other candidates were bidding to head the organization,
which has 157 members. Sidhu was elected by the organization's
33-member council after three rounds of balloting in a closed vote.
   The official said most Western members of the council supported
Lambert on the first ballot, while Latin American nations backed
Brazil's Adyr da Silva and Third World members backed Sidhu.

   Jesse Jackson squeaked out a Democratic
primary win over Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore in the Cradle of the
Confederacy early Wednesday, while Vice President George Bush
drubbed Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in Alabama's Republican race.
   Jackson rallied a phalanx of black voters behind him to defeat
Gore, a white son of the neighboring state. With 3,448 of 4,304
precincts or 80 percent reporting, Jackson had 157,887 votes or 44
percent to Gore's 133,153 votes or 37 percent.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was next with 27,846 votes or
8 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 25,825 votes or 7
percent; former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart tallied 6,586 votes or 2
percent and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 2,644 votes or 1 percent.
   In the Republican contest, with 3,366 of 4,304 precincts or 78
percent reporting, Bush amassed 123,285 votes or 64 percent; Dole
had 31,279 votes or 16 percent; Pat Robertson had 27,192 votes or
14 percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 9,458 votes or 5
percent.
   For the Democrats, 56 delegates were at stake, while Republicans
picked 38 delegates.
   Jackson banked on a strong turnout of black voters, but Gore
hoped his appeal as a Southern neighbor and his endorsement by Sen.
Howell Heflin would lift him into the No. 1 spot, despite early
predictions that Jackson would win.
   Jackson made the largest investment of his campaign in TV ads in
the Birmingham area in hopes of nailing down a victory.
   Bush had the endorsement of Alabama Republican Party Chairman
Emory Folmar. But Republican Gov. Guy Hunt remained publicly
neutral, and other party officials joined up with Dole and Kemp,
saying they wanted a tougher, more conservative candidate.
   Robertson, drawing strength from religious fundamentalists, was
given a chance of capturing the No. 2 spot.
   Jackson ran fourth in Alabama in the 1984 primary when Walter
Mondale drew blacks from his camp. But this time black voters
avoided any major split.
   Gore billed himself as the conservative Democrat _ but in 1984
more than 75 percent of the votes went to the liberal Democrats
Mondale, Jackson and Gary Hart.
   The days prior to the election were marked by a new series of
skirmishes over the Democrats' rule against crossover voting, a
rule that ended up bloodying the party in 1986 and leading to the
election of a Republican governor for the first time this century.
   Democratic Party Chairman John Baker said voters who cast
ballots in the Republican primary Tuesday could not come back and
vote in Democratic primaries in June when nominees for hundreds of
local, state and congressional posts are chosen. Critics said
Alabama has no practical way to enforce the rule.

   A decision by three mushers to take a
mandatory 24-hour layover early in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race paid off as they sailed into the lead on a trail
packed smooth by other mushers.
   Joe Redington, who helped organize the first Iditarod 16 years
ago but has never won it, found himself in an unfamiliar place
Tuesday _ the lead.
   The Wasilla resident, trailed closely by Herbie Nayokpuk of
Shishmaref and Joe Garnie of Teller, left Tuesday morning from the
Rohn Roadhouse checkpoint, 271 miles into the race.
   The three took their layovers Sunday in Skwentna, just 150 miles
from the start in Anchorage. The race leaders passed them, only to
get bogged down in new snow. They took their mandatory layovers at
Rohn and watched helplessly as Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie raced
through. They had to wait until Tuesday afternoon to leave.
   ``I kind of have this feeling in the back of my mind that we're
going to see two Eskimos _ Garnie and Nayokpuk _ blazing across
this state,'' said Jerry Austin of St. Michael, one of the mushers
taking his layover at Rohn.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana was the first musher to leave Rohn, and at
4:39 p.m. Tuesday became the first musher to arrive at Nikolai, the
next checkpoint 93 miles down the trail. But he had not yet taken
his 24-hour layover, and so will have to sit in Nikolai for a day
while the caravan of mushers passes.
   Redington left Rohn at 7:20 a.m. Tuesday. Nayokpuk followed two
minutes later, and Garnie left at 9 a.m.
   By Tuesday evening, 49 of the 52 teams racing had reached the
Rohn Roadhouse.
   U.S. mushers from outside Alaska, and their positions at last
report: Frank Teasley of Jackson, Wyo., 23rd; Dan MacEachen of
Snowmass Village, Colo., 25th; Terry Adkins of Mikado, Mich., 26th;
John Patten of Grand Marais, Minn., 27th; Stan Ferguson of
Philadelphia, 35th; and Robin Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., 40th.

   Jesse Jackson repeated his 1984 Louisiana
Democratic primary triumph, his only victory four years ago, and
won four more Southern states on Super Tuesday as Vice President
George Bush overwhelmed GOP rivals.
   Jackson won in Georgia, Mississippi, Virginia and Alabama,
fighting off a strong challenge here by Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore,
whose state campaign leader said Jackson should be disappointed by
his showing in Louisiana and worried about Gore's challenge.
   ``We feel that a turnaround has come, and again looking further
down the road we feel that Sen. Gore can pull the Democratic Party
back together,'' said Bud Courson, Gore's state campaign
coordinator.
   With 3,180 of 3,272 precincts, or 97 percent, reporting, Jackson
had 214,426 votes, or 34 percent; Gore had 177,279, or 29 percent;
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 95,309, or 15 percent; and
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt tallied 66,357, or 11 percent.
   With reports in from 3,166 of the 3,272 precincts, or 97
percent, Bush had 85,837 votes, or 59 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole
tallied 25,710, or 18 percent; former television evangelist Pat
Robertson had 25,601, or 18 percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemp
had 7,614, or 5 percent.
   The results apparently translate into 31 delegates for Jackson,
23 for Gore and seven for Dukakis and two for Gephardt. On the
Republican side, Bush nabbed 34 delegates with seven uncommitted.
   Greg Beuerman, Dole's Louisiana campaign boss, said he was not
surprised by the vote and the pendulum would shift to Dole in the
Midwest primaries. ``The South is to George Bush what the Midwest
has been to Bob Dole,'' he said.
   In the 4th Congressional District race to replace Democratic
Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer in the U.S. House, Roemer's former aide Jim
McCrery, a Republican, and Democratic state Sen. Foster Campbell
claimed spots in an April 16 runoff.
   McCrery, the sole Republican in the race, led the 10-candidate
field. Roemer voiced support for former Shreveport Journal editor
Stan Tiner during the campaign.
   However, Tiner ran third as McCrery and Campbell, a state
senator since 1976, claimed runoff spots. McCrery tallied 31
percent of the vote to 19 percent for Campbell.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., three
weeks from his 40th birthday, received an early gift of victory
from adoring constituents in the Democratic presidential primary,
while Vice President George Bush handily defeated GOP rivals.
   ``In 1960, we replaced the oldest president then to serve with
the youngest to be elected,'' Gore said on Tuesday night, comparing
himself with the late John F. Kennedy. ``Today, history is going to
repeat itself.''
   With 2,369 of 2,391 precincts or 99 percent reporting, Gore had
410,202 or 72 percent. Jesse Jackson had 117,152 or 21 percent;
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 18,982 or 3 percent; and
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 8,503 or 2 percent.
   Among Republicans, with 2,298 of 2,391 precincts or 96 percent
reporting, Bush had 141,743 or 60 percent and Dole had 51,239 or 22
percent. Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson had 29,326 or 12
percent and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 11,490 or 5 percent.
   That should give Bush 28 of the 45 delegates, with 11 for Dole,
one to Robertson and five uncommitted.
   Gore would take 56 of his party's delegates with 14 for Jackson.
   ``This is a fight for the future of the Democratic Party,'' Gore
told 1,000 supporters crowded into a hotel ballroom on Tuesday
night. ``It's a fight for whether we are going to have a viable
Democratic Party and win in November.''
   Gore, who staked his hopes on a campaign concentrated in the 14
Southern states that conducted Super Tuesday primaries, plans to
fly to Chicago today to begin his campaign for the Illinois primary
next Tuesday. The Michigan primary is March 26, five days before
Gore's birthday.
   Jackson supporters said they had expected a better showing in
the Volunteer State.
   ``We were hoping we'd do a little better,'' said state Rep.
Roscoe Dixon, D-Memphis. ``The rain in the West Tennessee area kept
our turnout down, but we feel good about it.''
   U.S. Rep. James Quillen, a Tennessee Republican and a leader of
Bush's Tennessee campaign, said Bush's victory didn't surprise him.
   The victory ``demonstrates that the people realize that he is
fully dedicated and qualified to be next president of the United
States,'' Quillen said.
   Voter turnout across Tennessee was light to moderate, election
officials said.

<HEAD>Ortega Accuses Reagan Of Keeping Contras Out Of Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega accused the
White House of being behind the Contras' pullout from cease-fire
talks that had been set for today, saying the rebels and their
sponsors ``fear negotiations.''
   He said President Reagan should be held responsible for
continued bloodshed caused by the Contras, whom he branded as U.S.
``mercenaries,'' and called for rescheduling the talks, which were
to have been the first in Nicaragua and without a mediator.
   Ortega's comments came after the Contras on Tuesday pulled out
of the talks that were to be held at a post bordering Costa Rica.
The rebels said preliminary meetings should first work out details.
   ``This shows again the lack of political will of the United
States government and the counterrevolutionary leaders, as their
instrument, to end the war of aggression and terrorist acts against
the Nicaraguan people and accept a peaceful solution to the
conflict,'' Ortega said, reading from a prepared statement.
   He suggested the talks be held during the third week of March
and have an open agenda. His leftist Sandinista government had made
preparations for the talks to be held at Sapoa, 90 miles south of
Managua.
   The secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
Joao Baena Soares, arrived in Nicaragua Tuesday, a day after Ortega
invited him to a witness the talks.
   The rebels, supplied and trained by the United States, said
Monday that they would not accept the talks without Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo serving as ``witness, moderator and guarantor of the
talks.''
   Ortega responded by calling on the Nicaraguan Roman Catholic
prelate, who has often criticized the Sandinistas, along with Baena
Soares, to attend the talks but only as a witness.
   In a communique, the Contras said details of the talks needed to
be worked out. It also appeared the rebels would press for more
involvement in the meetings by the cardinal, whom Ortega removed as
mediator last week.
   Ortega said Obando y Bravo's efforts no longer were needed
because the talks would be face to face. But Sandinista and
opposition sources said the cardinal was removed for trying to take
the initiative with a proposal of his own at the last
Contra-Sandinista meeting to end the 6{-year-old civil war.
   In a speech Tuesday night at the Revolution Plaza in honor of
International Women's Day, Ortega said his government was ready to
resume talks ``without conditions.''
   He added, however, ``It is clear we will not discuss the
revolution. We will not discuss the right of the Nicaraguan people
and the legitimate government of Nicaragua to arm itself. This we
won't negotiate.''
   The Sandinistas, who came to power in a 1979 revolution that
ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza, maintain the talks should deal
only with the mechanics of the Contras' disarmament and amnesty.
   Ortega cemented that position last week when he named his
brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister, to head the
government delegation to the talks.
   The rebels named Adolfo Calero, the top political leader of the
Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella organization, to lead
their side.
   Obando y Bravo on Feb. 18 called on the Sandinistas to grant
total amnesty, restore full press freedoms, reopen talks with the
internal political opposition and revise the military draft law. He
also called for a 30-day truce to allow the Contras to move into
enclaves to later lay down their arms.
   The Contras accepted Obando y Bravo's proposal. The Sandinistas
hesitated and the cardinal broke off talks, saying the two sides
were at an impasse.
   In his speech Tuesday night, Ortega said Reagan was responsible
for the suspension of cease-fire talks.
   ``Reagan and his mercenaries have not accepted our proposal to
talk tomorrow,'' he said. ``They fear negotiations.''

   The practice of flooding city council members
with free passes to municipal golf courses has driven the city's
portion of the profits slicing into the rough.
   A move to end the practice was opposed this week by only two of
the 16 council members present and has landed in the same place.
   ``We have funny rules,'' said councilman Robb Pitts.
   Two years ago, the city leased its four courses to American
Golfing Co. for $80,000 a year. The lease gives each of the 19
council members 10 passes good for unlimited play.
   But the price of each ``free'' round is deducted from the lease
fee, and instead of the $80,000 the city might have received this
year, it will take in only about $14,000 based on projected free
use through May 1.
   The lease fee increases to $120,000 next year.
   With a city budget of some $250 million, that's a not a lot of
money, but for months council members passed it around like a
grenade with the pin pulled.
   ``We lease the golf courses out not only to improve the courses
but to make a profit. I don't think we ought to erode that profit
by giving free passes to people who are able to pay,'' Councilwoman
Myrtle Davis said before the vote.
   Councilman Dozier Smith defended the passes, saying they allowed
elderly constituents on fixed incomes to play.
   Councilman Hosea Williams, who voted to retain the passes and
abstained on a companion proposal to abolish them, said he favored
perquisites such as the passes, claiming council members are not
well paid.
   Most council members, including Williams, who owns a chemical
company, have substantial income outside their $18,400-a-year
council salaries and say they don't use the passes themselves.
   ``Most of them apparently give them to their constituents. The
people who get them the most are those that can afford to pay,''
said Pitts, who led the drive to eliminate the passes.
   ``You would be surprised at the names of the people I have heard
mentioned who have them. It is more of a prestige thing than a
need, to say you have one. It got out of hand.''
   He cited Park and Recreation Department figures projecting a
city loss of more than $670,000 during the first 10 years of the
lease based on current free uses.
   He said he is dropping the fight and knows of nobody eager to
pick it up. ``The results would be the same,'' he said.
   This week's attempt to eliminate the passes was killed through
abstentions, which, under council rules, have the effect of a
``no'' vote. More than half of the members present must vote
``yes'' on an issue to pass it. While only two of the 16 members
present voted against abolishing the passes, nine abstained.

   Michael Dukakis circled Dixie and claimed a national candidacy
on Super Tuesday, while Albert Gore Jr. looked ahead to a ``long,
hard-fought contest'' after passing his do-or-die Southern test.
Jesse Jackson hailed his ``new Southern message'' that produced
victories in a fractured Democratic field.
   Super Tuesday's loser was Richard Gephardt, who won his home
state of Missouri but fared badly elsewhere. He failed to meet the
15 percent threshold required to win delegates in many states.
   With a splintered outcome, three of the Democratic candidates
could _ and did _ argue they did well on the busiest day of
presidential primaries in history.
   For Jackson it was victories in five states and an impressive
improvement over his campaign four years ago. For Dukakis it was a
display of support outside his native New England and claim to a
national candidacy. And for Gore it was the right to claim wide
support across the South and a spot among the contenders for the
nomination.
   Gore immediately took aim at Dukakis as his chief rival and
compared him to Walter Mondale and the Democrats' 1984 debacle.
   ``I think Mike Dukakis is going to represent for many voters the
same old formula that led to the loss of 49 out of 50 states twice
in the last five elections,'' Gore said.
   He said the race ``is going to be a long, hard-fought contest.
It's also going to be a long, hard-fought contest in the fall. We
need to select the candidate with the best chance of winning.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, countered: ``Remember, this
was a place where the guy from Massachusetts wasn't supposed to do
well at all.''
   ``If we can come out of Super Tuesday with the largest
cumulative total of delegates, I think we're going to be on our
way,'' Dukakis said.
   Jackson won Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and
Virginia; Gore won Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Kentucky and
his home state of Tennessee.
   Jackson, the black civil rights leader, savored his Alabama
showing and recalled the violent struggle for equality in Selma,
Ala. 23 years ago.
   ``The same state that wouldn't let us walk across the bridge _
we won that state today,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis won in his home state of Massachusetts as well as in
neighboring Rhode Island, in Maryland, Idaho caucuses and in the
two mega-states of Florida and Texas.
   ``This has been a great night for us,'' said Dukakis. ``To be
able to take Texas and Florida, the two big ones, and to do well
across the board demonstrates that this is a national candidacy, a
national campaign.''
   Demonstrating the mixed verdict, Jackson, Gore and Dukakis each
collected roughly the same number of votes: 2.4 million votes.
   Jackson's big win in Virginia with nearly half of the vote and
strong showing elsewhere assured he would fare better than his 1984
campaign, when he won only Louisiana.
   ``I've won Southern states today, either number one or number
two, with a new Southern message,'' Jackson said.
   ``And that message is fundamentally, we the people must stop
drugs from threatening our national security and our streets, we
must fight to end economic violence. That message is getting
through.
   ``We've gone from a narrow mainstream to a broad-based river,''
Jackson said.
   He added: ``we're the underdog with the biggest bite.''
   Gore led in the Nevada caucuses, while Jackson led Dukakis in
early returns from Hawaii's caucuses. American Samoa gave one
delegate to Dukakis, one to Gephardt and one to the ranks of the
uncommitted.
   All were vying for a share of the 1,307 Democratic presidential
nominating delegates at stake in 20 states.
   In the crucial delegate battle, Dukakis won 372 delegates out of
Super Tuesday. Gore won 316, Jackson won 353 and Gephardt won 94.
   Gore said he would be among the three candidates going to the
convention _ suggesting Gephardt wouldn't be able to.
   ``I think that three of us are going to go all the way to the
convention,'' Gore said. ``It will be a choice between the politics
of the past and the politics of the future.''
   Gephardt, who was caught in a withering crossfire of negative
television advertisements by Gore and Dukakis, offered
congratulations to all three. He blamed his failure on a lack of
money and vowed to go on to the next round of primaries.
   ``I'm far from chucking it in because this is a long race,''
Gephardt said. ``When we've been able to get my message across, as
I did in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Dakota ... we do well.''
   Democratic Party elder statesman Robert Strauss said the news of
Super Tuesday was grim for Gephardt, .
   He said Jackson, Dukakis and Gore ``are going North now, and
we'll see how it comes out. ... I expect one of those three fellows
will probably be the nominee.''
   ``I think Dick Gephardt's in trouble,'' Strauss said.
``Certainly Dukakis and Gore each have a great deal to be happy
about tonight.''
   Gephardt criticized the Super Tuesday process with 20 states
voting on a single day _ an arrangement that left his
money-strapped campaign hard pressed to keep up.
   ``I think maybe it was a disservice to the voters to put 20
states on one day,'' he said.
   Jackson, a black man born and educated in the South, relied on
his wide support among that region's large black population and
figured to be among the delegate leaders in the Super Tuesday
voting.
   Exit polling said Jackson won nearly all the black vote and 10
percent of the white vote.
   Two other candidates, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Gary Hart,
the former senator from Colorado, weren't factors.
   Simon, looking forward to the Illinois primary, said the outcome
was delegate ``gridlock.''
   ``It's going to be a brokered convention,'' he ssaid.

<HEAD>Opposition Says Government Arresting No-Show Election Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARID HOSSAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders today accused the
government of arresting and harassing poll workers who refused to
work during last week's violence-marred parliamentary elections.
   Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the two opposition leaders who led
the boycott of the March 3 balloting, said ``many'' people had been
arrested, but neither woman gave any numbers.
   ``If they are not released, the people will set them free,''
Mrs. Zia said in a statement published by Dhaka newspapers today.
   Ms. Hasina, in a separate statement carried by the press, said
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's government had once again
displayed its ``autocratic nature.''
   On Tuesday, newspapers in the capital said five people had been
arrested in the southern town of Barisal and 19 teachers in Dhaka
had gone into hiding to avoid arrest.
   School teachers and government employees normally staff polling
places during elections, but many who were slated for duty last
week did not show up, apparently out of fear for their safety.
   At least 13 people were killed and more than 300 injured in
election day clashes between supporters of rival parties. On Feb.
10, more than 100 people were killed during non-partisan elections
for local councils.
   Hasina's Awami League and Mrs. Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist
Party led a score of other political parties in boycotting the
parliamentary election. That left the field clear for Ershad's
Jatiya Party, which faced only token opposition.
   According to incomplete returns, the Jatiya Party has won 238 of
Parliament's 300 seats. Small parties and independents took 41
seats.
   Voting was postponed until Saturday in 20 constituencies because
of violence. In another constituency, voting was delayed
indefinitely after a candidate was killed in pre-election violence.
   Hasina, daughter of President Mujibur Rahman who was
assassinated in 1975, and Mrs. Zia, widow of President Ziaur Rahman
who was assassinated in 1981, have led a 4-month-old campaign to
topple Ershad.
   Ershad, a former army general, seized power in a 1982 coup and
subsequently won a presidential election the opposition says was
rigged.
   Meanwhile, the state-operated news agency Bangladesh Sangbad
Sangstha said the government had ``initiated action'' against those
responsible for preventing a prominent opposition official from
leaving the country.
   The news agency did not say what this action was.
   Former Foreign Minister Kamal Hossain, a member of the Awami
League's presidium, was taken off an airplane Tuesday when he tried
to leave for Sydney, Australia.
   ``It was never the intention of the government to stop his going
abroad,'' the news agency said.

<TEXT>
   With their sights set on the White House,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush
stalked and bagged a prize apiece in Florida, one of the biggest
catches in the presidential primaries.
   ``You can't win with smoke and mirrors,'' Mike Abrams, a
political strategist for Dukakis in Florida, said on Tuesday. ``You
need people. We knew the organization had to be here. From the way
we put together our phone banks to our wooing of constituent
leaders, it was relentless.''
   With 4,143 of 4,459 precincts or 93 percent reporting, Dukakis
had 466,831 votes or 40 percent; Jesse Jackson had 238,142 or 20
percent. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 171,131 or 15 percent,
followed closely by Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. with 152,120 or
13 percent.
   In the GOP race, with 4,143 of 4,459 precincts or 93 percent
reporting, Bush had 497,993 votes or 63 percent; Dole had 162,057
or 20 percent; former TV evangelist Pat Robertson had 86,656 or 11
percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 36,810 votes or 5 percent.
   Bush took advantage of President Reagan's popularity, a
gubernatorial endorsement and family ties in Florida to trounce
Dole and claim the lion's share of 82 GOP delegates.
   ``I'm pretty confident now that he will win the nomination,''
said Bush's son Jeb, Florida's secretary of commerce. ``He got
knocked down in Iowa, changed strategy a little bit and came back.''
   Dukakis, who organized here early, visited frequently and
courted the retirees and condo dwellers who have fled from colder
regions, built an impressive late lead based on polls in the state
that boasted the second-biggest prize of Super Tuesday after Texas:
136 Democratic delegates.
   ``When we first came down here we were told not to expend much
effort, this was a media state,'' said Steve Rosenfeld, Dukakis
state campaign manager. ``Tonight we proved that (to be) obsolete
wisdom. We won with people, we won with organization and we won
with the best candidate.''
   Robertson looked for support in conservative North Florida and
played heavily to Cubans with his assertions about missiles in
Cuba. Dole, who keeps a winter home in Bal Harbour, admitted he was
out-organized by Bush.
   Among Democrats, the state was seen by some as a litmus test of
national appeal, with liberal Democrats in South Florida,
traditional Southern Democrats in North Florida, arch-conservative
Cubans in Miami and Midwestern retirees on the Southwest Gulf Coast.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis captured
the top delegate state in the Super Tuesday presidential primaries,
while Vice President George Bush shut out Republican rivals to grab
all 111 Texas GOP delegates.
   ``It has exceeded my fondest expectations,'' Bush told several
hundred supporters crowding a ballroom at at Houston hotel soon
after polls closed on Super Tuesday.
   With 6,079 of 6,933 precincts or 88 percent reporting, Dukakis
had 497,592 votes or 33 percent; Jesse Jackson had 364,242 votes or
24 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 313,026 votes or 20
percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 212,972 votes or 14
percent; former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 77,184 votes or 5
percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 29,038 votes or 2 percent.
   In the Republican race, with 4,687 of 5,616 precincts or 83
percent reporting, Bush had 542,206 votes or 65 percent; Pat
Robertson had 125,164 votes or 15 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had
115,119 votes or 14 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 40,468
votes or 5 percent.
   Dukakis was expected to get 45 of the state's 183 delegates up
for grabs, Jackson 40, Gore 23 and Gephart 10. Fourteen other
Democratic seats go to party officials.
   Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen easily won
renomination in his bid for a fourth term. Top Republican
challengers Beau Boulter, who gave up his congressional seat for
the Senate race, and Wes Gilbreath, a Houston investor making his
first race for a political office, will meet in a runoff. The
winner squares off against Bentsen in November.
   Dukakis, in a televised interview Tuesday from Chicago, said,
``I feel very good about the South. I feel good about tonight,
obviously.''
   Bush, who built an oil business in Texas, rents a motel in
Houston so he can vote in the state. He led in polls throughout the
campaign.
   At the victory party Tuesday night, Tom Loeffler, the former
Texas congressman who is co-chairman of Bush's Texas campaign, gave
the vice president a T-shirt emblazoned with ``Bush in '88 _ Texas
Victory _ Super Tuesday,'' while the crowd cheered and waved U.S.
flags.
   ``It's a wonderful evening, I'll tell you,'' Bush said.

   Vice President George Bush won by a little
and gained nearly all the state's GOP delegates, while Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore won big in a 12-candidate field and settled for
half of the Democratic prize.
   Bush beat Kansas Sen. Bob Dole by 2 percent, but won in five of
the six congressional districts, apparently gaining 33 of 36
delegates available, while Dole won three delegates and Pat
Robertson finished third and got none.
   ``If Dole can't win in Oklahoma, where can he win?'' said Matt
Seward, Bush's campaign director in Oklahoma. He said Oklahoma was
one of three states Dole had targeted to win in the 20-state Super
Tuesday elections.
   Gore captured 41 percent of the vote among 12 candidates, almost
twice that of his nearest rival, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt,
but claimed only 23 of the state's 46 delegates up for grabs.
   Gephardt, the early frontrunner in Oklahoma, finished second in
five districts and claimed 13 delegates. Dukakis got seven
delegates and Jackson received three.
   In Republican voting with 2,422 of 2,439 precincts reporting, or
99 percent, Bush had 77,938 votes, or 37 percent; Dole had 72,683
or 35 percent. Robertson had 44,197, or 21 percent and New York
Congressman Jack Kemp had 11,018, or 5 percent.
   With 2,434 of 2,439 precincts reporting, or 99 percent of
Democratic returns, Gore had 162,187 votes, or 41 percent; Gephardt
had 82,267, or 21 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had
66,150, or 17 percent, and Jackson had 52,460, or 13 percent.
   Bush supporters were hoping today that Tuesday's victory in
Dole's backyard will prove decisive in derailing the vice
president's main opponent in the Republican presidential
sweepstakes.
   Supporters of Gore said the senator's surprisingly strong
victory in the Sooner State will help the southerner stake a claim
as the ``mainstream'' candidate who can return the White House to
the Democratic fold in November.
   ``Super Tuesday has proven that Al Gore is the candidate for
mainstream Democrats,'' said state Sen. Stratton Taylor,
co-chairman of the Gore drive in Oklahoma.

   Two native sons, Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice
President George Bush, scored convincing wins in the Massachusetts
primary. Jesse Jackson in the Democratic race and Sen. Bob Dole in
the GOP contest finished far behind.
   The win at home and victories in Florida and Texas gave Dukakis
the three biggest Super Tuesday prizes. The Bush victory in
Massachusetts, where he was born, was part of a Super Tuesday
landslide.
   With 1,925 of 2,140 precincts, or 90 percent, reporting, Dukakis
led with 367,637 votes, or 59 percent, followed by Jackson with
117,408 votes, or 19 percent.
   With 1,924 of the 2,140 precincts, or 90 percent, reporting,
Bush had 127,918 votes, or 59 percent. Dole had 57,426 or 26
percent.
   Dukakis, the popular governor of this liberal state, was a
prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary, where 98 delegates
were at stake, the party's third-biggest prize of the day. It
appeared Dukakis would get 79 of the delegates and Jackson the
remaining 19.
   ``This augurs very well for the future,'' said Dukakis in a
television interview from Chicago.
   But he denied the Super Tuesday results would secure the
Democratic nomination for him.
   Dukakis had not campaigned in Massachusetts until last week,
when he took to the streets of Cambridge for about an hour of
stumping. None of his rivals bothered to spend time or money here.
   In the Republican primary, 52 delegates were at stake, the
fourth-biggest batch on Super Tuesday.
   Bush established a wide early lead in the tiny Massachusetts
Republican party and held off Dole, who did not campaign here. Bush
won the 1980 GOP primary here, defeating Ronald Reagan.
   Well behind Bush and Dole were Rep. Jack Kemp, who had 15,134
votes, or 7 percent, and Pat Robertson, who received 9,963 votes,
or 5 percent.
   Analyzing Bush's victory, Gordon Nelson, state co-chair for
Kemp's campaign, said the vice president convinced voters he was
President Reagan's logical successor: ``George Bush won because he
is Reagan II.''
   In third place among the Democrats was Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt with 63,865 votes, or 10 percent, followed by Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. with 28,135 votes, or 4 percent, and Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon with 22,692 votes, or 4 percent.
   Gary Hart, who won the 1984 Massachusetts Democratic primary,
trailed the field of active candidates with 9,955 votes, or 2
percent.

<HEAD>Southern Calif. Unprepared To Handle Soviet Exodus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Emigres from Soviet Armenia are flocking to
Southern California, and local officials are scrambling to meet
their needs.
   Since October, about 2,000 Soviet Armenians have arrived in the
Los Angeles area, and 8,000 to 10,000 more are expected by the end
of the year, along with as many as 3,000 Armenians from Iran,
according to the State Department.
   ``The whole city's not ready for this,'' said Arick Gevorkian of
the Glendale office of the Armenian National Committee.
   ``Right now, we're organizing with the school district, with the
churches, trying to facilitate these newcomers,'' Gevorkian said.
``But we are racing against time and we are not very ready.''
   The influx began when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched
his campaign of ``glasnost,'' or openness, and officials were
instructed to approve exit visas for Armenians wanting to join
relatives in America.
   Officials say the influx is not related to recent turmoil in
Soviet Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan.
   ```Going to Hollywood, going to Hollywood.' You hear it all the
time on the streets of Yerevan,'' Armenia's capital, said Harry
Diramarian, a local Armenian leader.
   Southern California's Armenian-American population numbers in
the tens of thousands. Prominent Armenian-Americans include Gov.
George Deukmejian and the late author William Saroyan of Fresno.
   Worried officials said absorbing the newcomers probably will be
hampered by the nearly 50 percent cutback in federal refugee
assistance funding since 1984.
   However, with the increasing numbers of emigres entering public
schools and applying for public assistance, welfare offices in
Hollywood and Glendale have added nearly a dozen Armenian-speaking
employees.
   Glendale schools hired five additional Armenian-speaking
teachers or aides to complement the eight already on staff. More
are planned.
   Officials said it's essential to provide such services early on
or risk the refugees becoming permanently dependent on the
government.
   ``Every public and private agency is understaffed, and it means
that the Armenians are confronting delays in getting their most
basic services,'' said Bruce Whipple, director of the local office
of the International Rescue Committee, a private agency that
assists refugees during their first 30 days of resettlement.
   ``Right now, we have no job training or ESL (English as a Second
Language) slots to put Armenian refugees in,'' said Joan Pinchuk,
Los Angeles County's coordinator for refugee affairs.
   Last year, 3,250 Soviet Armenians emigrated to the United
States, more than 13 times the number who came in 1986.
   Armenian community leaders said these numbers reflect only a
fraction of the potential emigres who would like to move to
Southern California.
   Terry Rusch of the State Department's Bureau for Immigrant
Programs said the relaxation of emigration restrictions has been
extended to Soviet Jews, but not to the same degree as for
Armenians.
   Some Armenian-Americans are dismayed by the influx, arguing that
a mass exodus from the Soviet Union weakens the only homeland the
Armenians know, as well as their claim to Armenian lands in Turkey.
   ``Every Armenian who leaves Armenia not only diminishes our
collective power there, but is also risking the eventual loss of
his or her national heritage and identity,'' said Harut Sassounian,
editor of the California Courier, an Armenian-American weekly
published in Glendale.
   ``Unlike Soviet Jews, Soviet Armenians are not emigrating to
their homeland. Instead, they are leaving it.''

<HEAD>Emergency Shuttle Landing Site Under Construction in Morocco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the space shuttles begin flying again,
they will have a new emergency landing site at an abandoned
Strategic Air Command base near Ben Guerir, Morrocco.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Tuesday
announced construction of the new site has begun at the base, 40
miles north of Marrakech. It will be the fourth emergency landing
site.
   The former SAC base has a 14,000 foot runway, but its surface
must be rejuvenated to make it usable by shuttles that for some
reason they fail to reach the speeds necessary to get into orbit.
   NASA announced earlier in the week that another airport site in
northwest Africa, in the tiny country of The Gambia, will be
upgraded to accommodate shuttles. The space agency intends to
continue using runways at Zaragoza Air Base and Moron Air Base in

<HEAD>Jewish Advisers to Reagan Criticize Senators' Letter on Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Jewish advisers to President Reagan
says the 30 senators who wrote a letter supporting the
administration's position that it is time for Israel to exchange
land for peace is acting too quickly and meddling in Israeli
internal affairs.
   The group, known as the National Jewish Coalition, said the
senators ``operated in haste'' and were ``inserting themselves into
the internal politics of Israel.''
   The coalition, formed after the 1984 election to advise Reagan
on Jewish matters, issued its statement after a meeting in the Oval
Office with Reagan. However, Richard Fox, the chairman of the
organization, said the president did not discuss the peace process
or the violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   He said the meeting with Reagan lasted only 12 or 13 minutes and
the president's comments were ``really more of a ceremonial
statement. There was no forum for discussion of the issue.''
   On Monday, the White House had said it welcomed the senators'
statement, in which they criticized Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and his Likud party, suggesting they may be blocking efforts
to reach a peace settlement in the Middle East.

<HEAD>Groups Challenge Provisions of Alien Amnesty Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eligibility for legalization of hundreds
of illegal aliens may rest on a federal court's interpretation of
four words in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service rules
for implementation of the government's amnesty program.
   A class action suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court on
behalf of five illegal aliens to block INS rules defining which
illegal aliens were ``known to the government'' and are eligible
for amnesty.
   INS rules under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
provide amnesty to aliens who lived illegally in the United States
before Jan. 1, 1982 as well as to agricultural workers who can
prove they lived in this country for at least 90 days in the year
ended May 1, 1986.
   A problem has arisen over individuals who arrived legally _ with
a visa _ but who remained in the country illegally after the Jan.
1, 1982 cutoff date, according to Debbi Sanders of the Washington
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, one of the attorneys for the
plantiffs.
   In cases like these, the statute grants amnesty to those whose
illegal status was ``known to the government'' and advocates for
illegal aliens have sought to use Social Security and Internal
Revenue Service forms to prove that aliens in this category were
known.
   The INS, however, maintains that ``known to the government''
meant known to the INS, Sanders said, noting that this difference
of interpretation disqualified hundreds of illegals.

<HEAD>Talks Fail on US Participation in Japanese Contruction Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week of talks between U.S. and Japanese
officials over participation by U.S. firms in billions of dollars
worth of Japanese building projects has ended in failure.
   And, a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Tuesday said that President Reagan under the law could retaliate
against Japan for what are considered unfair trade practices.
   ``That is one of the options,'' the official said, adding that
the Reagan administration will decide probably by the end of next
week what its next step will be.
   The official said the U.S. side had exhausted its capacity to
resolve the issues and was not ready to go on talking, given the
differences between the two sides.
   The official said the U.S. delegation to the talks also had
wanted the arrangements on participation by U.S. construction firms
written into a formal agreement, while the Japanese did not want to
be bound and sought only a joint statement that unspecified
arrangements were satisfactory.

   The dollar rose slightly in Tokyo today, while
stock prices gained substantially following an overnight advance on
Wall Street.
   The dollar closed at 128.08 yen, up 0.28 yen from Tuesday's
close. It opened at 127.80 yen and ranged between 127.73 yen and
128.27 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average,
which lost 150.85 points Tuesday, gained back 139.66 points, or
0.55 percent, closing at 25,605.39.
   ``Share prices in New York rose yesterday, and the foreign
exchange market has stabilized,'' said Michio Katsumata of Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage house.
   Today's heavy volume of 1.3 billion shares was concentrated in
steel and heavy industry stocks, which made strong advances, said
Richard Bixon, a trader at Vickers da Costa.
   The market had been apprehensive about the outcome of
presidential primary elections in the United States on Tuesday,
Bixon said.
   ``The main worry there ... was always going to be (Democratic
candidate Richard) Gephardt, because he was widely interpreted as a
protectionist,'' he said. Gephardt fared poorly in the elections.
   Trading was slow on the foreign exchange market as dealers
waited out the final days of the Japanese fiscal year, which ends
March 31, said Shigeki Kawano, a dealer at Mitsubishi Bank.
   Dealers also were awaiting the release of key economic
indicators. Japan's February trade data are to be released
Thursday, and figures for U.S. January trade are scheduled for
release next week in Washington.
   ``It's still a very sleepy market,'' Kawano said.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Winners In Idaho</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis coasted
to victory in Idaho's Democratic presidential caucuses, but Jesse
Jackson surprised party leaders with a strong showing.
   With all 45 precincts reporting early today, Dukakis had 1,516
votes or 38 percent; Jackson had 882 votes or 22 percent; Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 333 votes or 8 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon had 280 votes or 7 percent, and Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt had 44 votes or 1 percent.
   Dukakis captured 8 of Idaho's 18 delegates, with Jackson winning
four. Six delegates will go to the national convention uncommitted.
   ``Michael Dukakis is foreseen as the frontrunner _ a winner,''
said former governor John Evans, who headed the Dukakis campaign.
``He is perceived as the candidate of the people.''
   The turnout was higher than the number of Democrats who attended
the 1984 caucuses. ``The real message tonight is that we are
getting a lot of people out,'' said Gov. Cecil Andrus, who says he
will go to the convention uncommitted.
   Jackson's strong finish, in a state with a minority population
of less than 5 percent, surprised most campaign leaders.
   ``I didn't recognize where his strength was coming from,'' Evans
said. ``But he (Jackson) is doing better than four years ago.
Obviously he has matured, but it still surprises me.''
   The Republican presidential primary will be held May 24.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a fresh
face in the Democratic crowd, waltzed to victory in Arkansas while
another neighbor, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, was battered into
defeat by his rivals, the state's governor said.
   ``I was a little surprised by how far Gephardt fell,'' Gov. Bill
Clinton said after Gore scored a decisive win over Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis in the Super Tuesday Democratic primary,
leaving Gephardt a distant fourth.
   ``That's really the story of this election. What happened was
Dukakis and Gore were attacking Gephardt. Gore and Gephardt were
attacking Dukakis. Nobody was attacking Gore on television. He got
off with a free ride in this fight.''
   Gephardt, an early front-runner in the 1988 campaign with his
Iowa win, suffered a similar fate elsewhere on Super Tuesday,
winning only his home state of Missouri. Gore, who stayed out of
the national spotlight by focusing on the South, triumphed in five
of the day's 20 state primaries.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush trounced Sen.
Bob Dole on his way to a 16-state sweep of his Kansas rival.
   Rep. Bill Alexander had little trouble defeating political
consultant Darrell Glascock for the Democratic nomination for the
1st Congressional District of eastern Arkansas. There was no
Republican candidate in this heavily Democratic state.
   With 2,541 of 2,762 precincts or 92 percent reporting, Gore
tallied 178,502 votes or 37 percent to Dukakis' 93,543, or 19
percent, and Jesse Jackson's 85,064, or 17 percent. Gephardt
trailed with 57,783 votes, or 12 percent.
   Far behind were Gary Hart with 18,520 votes or 4 percent and
Paul Simon with 8,981 votes or 2 percent.
   Democratic candidates must attract at least 15 percent to share
in the 38 delegates up for grabs. Gore will likely get 19
delegates, Dukakis 10 and Jackson nine.
   With 3,366 of 4,304 precincts or 78 percent reporting, Bush
tallied 123,285 votes or 64 percent to Dole's 31,279 or 16 percent.
Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson had 27,192 or 14 percent and New
York Rep. Jack Kemp was far back with 9,458 or 5 percent.
   Republican candidates must get at least 3 percent of the vote to
qualify for delegates. With half the precincts reporting, Bush
garnered 14 delegates to Dole's seven, Robertson's five and Kemp's
one.
   Gov. Bill Clinton, who all but endorsed Dukakis, said Gore
benefited from the undecided voters.
   ``Dukakis and Jackson should be very pleased,'' the Democratic
governor said. ``Gore should be relieved. He did better than he was
expected to do for the last couple of weeks, (although) probably
not quite as well as he hoped he'd do when he started.''

<HEAD>Government Warns Media About Critical Reporting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government has warned the media
it will not tolerate ``cynical insinuations,'' ``false
accusations'' and ``public insults,'' presumably in reaction to
news reports of high-level corruption.
   The communique issued Tuesday night did not mention specific
cases.
   However, local newspapers and radio stations have relayed U.S.
media reports of charges of drug trafficking made against Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, the target of a U.S. federal grand jury probe.
   The Haitian military said the charges were unfounded.
   Also, the Protestant station Radio Lumiere recently broadcast an
interview in which opposition leader Sylvio Claude accused
President Leslie Manigat of accepting bribes from Philadelphia
authorities for allowing toxic ash from that city to be dumped in
Haiti.
   Claude presented no proof to substantiate his charges.
   ``The Information Ministry has noticed a tendency of the Haitian
media to not control its language when releasing news or
interviews,'' says the communique signed by Information Minister
Roger Savain and broadcast by radio stations.
   ``There is also a tendency to emit erroneous information under
the pretext of citing the foreign news media as a source,'' it says.
   ``Though the Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech ...
its authors also made clear what were the limits beyond which
freedom of speech becomes an abuse,'' the statement continues.
``Cynical insinuations, false or libelous accusations and serious
public insults are intolerable cases of abuse of the freedom of
speech.
   ``The Ministry of Information ... invites the Haitian and
foreign press to respect in the strictest manner the Constitution
and law.''
   The Constitution says a journalist cannot be censored, but has
the ``duty to verify the authenticity and accuracy of his
information.''
   During anti-government strikes and demonstrations in July and
August, radio stations were firebombed and riddled with bullets. At
least four Haitian reporters were shot and wounded by soldiers
during the period, and soldiers shot at foreign reporters in at
least 10 cases.
   On the eve of the the aborted Nov. 29 national elections, in
which gunmen and soldiers killed 34 people at polling stations,
witnesses saw uniformed soldiers blow up the transmittor tower of
the Catholic Church's Radio Soleil.
   Gunmen shot and killed at point blank range a Dominican
photographer, Carlos Grullon, during the election day violence.
   No gunman or soldier has been brought to trial for the shootings.
   Paul's unit, the widely feared Dessalines Barracks, is
responsible for virtually all army repression and killings of
demonstrators last year. Soldiers from the 700-man batallion were
also seen in the streets during the aborted Nov. 29 elections.
   Manigat was elected president Jan. 17 in balloting boycotted by
the opposition and marred by widespread irregularities.

<HEAD>Gore's Gain is Gephardt's Loss; Reagan Ties Aid Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert Gore Jr.'s do-or-die Southern strategy
succeeded at the expense of Democratic rival Richard Gephardt,
while Republican George Bush's association with the Reagan
administration carried him to his Super Tuesday sweep, pollsters
say.
   Michael Dukakis maintained his Democratic front-runner status on
the strength of victories in Texas and Florida, but Jesse Jackson
bolstered his nearly monolithic black support with additional
backing from whites, the analysts said.
   Gore's campaign did what it had to do in the South. The
Tennessee senator, who eschewed early contests in Iowa and New
Hampshire in favor of the 14 Southern and border states up for
grabs Tuesday, won five of them.
   ``It worked. He cleaned up in the South,'' said Warren Mitofsky,
chief pollster for CBS News. ``But he's got to prove it in the next
couple of weeks in Illinois and Wisconsin. He's got to show support
beyond the South.''
   Gore did well mainly at the expense of Gephardt, the Missouri
congressman, who won only his home state. Gore and Dukakis had
accused Gephardt of waffling on the issues, and exit polls
indicated the charges stuck.
   Gore won among conservative Democrats, with 35 percent, ABC News
exit polls said. He also found help in his Tennessee roots: Of the
52 percent of Southern voters born in the South, Gore was backed by
nearly a third, while Dukakis got 20 percent.
   ``If Gore's going to be the only conservative who goes on, then
he's got a shot,'' said Sheldon Gawiser, poll analyst for NBC News.
``The real question is, can he take his show on the road? The jury
is out on that.''
   One problem for Gore is the relative dearth of conservative
Democratic primary voters outside the South. ABC said conservatives
made up 27 percent of the Southern Democrats, considerably more
than is likely elsewhere.
   But Jackson demonstrated an ability to drain liberal and
moderate votes from Dukakis, possibly leaving Gore an opening to
siphon off a plurality in some states, Gawiser said.
   ``If Jackson continues to cut up the liberal vote with
Dukakis,'' he said, ``Gore can score.''
   Jackson won about 95 percent of the black vote in the South, but
also improved his showing among white voters compared with his
support in the 1984 campaign. ABC said he won 8 percent of white
votes in the region; the CBS News-New York Times poll put it at 9
percent.
   NBC, which gave state-by-state results, said Jackson's white
support ranged from 4 percent in Tennessee to 15 percent in
Virginia and 19 percent in Massachusetts, Dukakis' home state.
   Dukakis stitched together support from older voters, Hispanics,
Jews and moderates for his Southern victories. In Florida, 47
percent of Democratic voters were 60 and over and 52 percent of
them backed Dukakis, the CBS-Times poll said.
   The Massachusetts governor also did well with older voters
across the South. He split the moderates with Jackson, and Jackson
won more liberal Democrats, but ABC said Dukakis won 78 percent of
the Jewish vote across the region, compared with 3 percent for
Jackson.
   NBC said Dukakis was backed by 52 percent of Hispanic voters in
Texas, who made up 18 percent of the Democratic turnout. Dukakis
speaks fluent Spanish and had courted the Hispanic vote.
   Moreover, Dukakis had the best image among the Democratic
candidates, showing a 60 percent favorable rating compared with 31
percent unfavorable, the CBS-Times poll said.
   ``He's demonstrated appeal across the country. He's a very
strong candidate and he's got to be the leading contender at the
moment,'' Gawiser said.
   The hardest hit of the Democrats was Gephardt, whose
get-tough-on-trade message failed to strike a chord. Only 12
percent of Southern Democrats rated the issue as important, the
CBS-Times poll said, and even those went mainly for Gore, 35
percent to Gephardt's 21 percent.
   On the Republican side, Bush benefited from his credentials in
the Reagan administration. In some states as many as 80 percent of
the Republican voters approved of President Reagan, and 60 percent
of them backed Bush, the CBS-Times poll said.
   Bush also maintained favor among conservative Republicans and
among the one-third of GOP voters who rated experience as
important; nearly 80 percent of them went for the vice president,
polls said.
   Dole fared better with independents who voted Republican, a
relatively small group in the conservative-dominated South,
Mitofsky said.
   The Rev. Pat Robertson failed to break out of his core support
of evangelical Christians, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York fared
poorly in all categories, polls said.
   With the depth of his support, ``It's going to be very, very,
very difficult for Bush to be defeated at this stage of the game,''
Gawiser said. ``Unless he makes some horrendous mistake, he's not
going to lose.''
   Results of the state exit polls had error margins of about 5
percentage points either way; the CBS-Times poll results for the
region as a whole had a smaller margin of sampling error, about 2
percentage points.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis held a narrow
lead over Jesse Jackson in Hawaii's Democratic presidential
caucuses Tuesday.
   With 152 of 284 precincts or 54 percent reporting, Dukakis had

Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 55 votes or 2 percent, and

   About 30,000 Democrats were eligible to participate, but fewer

of the 2,000 new members signed up by Jackson's campaign were
expected to show up.
   Gov. John Waihee, who earlier had urged that the state's

Sens. Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga.
   Twenty delegates were at stake in the caucus voting.
   Jackson was the only candidate to visit Hawaii.

   Vice President George Bush stung Bob
Dole with a narrow victory in the Missouri GOP presidential
primary, crushing the Kansas senator's last hope to win a key Super
Tuesday state.
   Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt easily won his home state with
57 percent of the vote, but it was his only victory of the night.
His closest rival, Jesse Jackson, took 21 percent of the vote.
   The Bush victory in Dole's back yard went down to the wire, with
Bush pulling ahead only when final returns were reported from St.
Louis County, a Republican stronghold.
   ``Being in Missouri, right next to Kansas, I can't tell you how
sweet this victory is,'' said Bush campaigner Sissy Chamberlain.
``I'm not being vindictive, but we wanted to win it for the vice
president and we were able to squeak it out.''
   With 3,878 of 3,954 precincts, or 98 percent, reporting, Bush
had 167,991 votes, or 42 percent, and Dole had 163,394 or 41
percent; Pat Robertson had 44,334, or 11 percent, and New York Rep.
Jack Kemp had 14,125, or 4 percent.
   In the Democratic race, with 3,919 of 3,954 precincts, or 99
percent, reporting, Gephardt had 307,877 votes or 58 percent and
Jackson had 106,619 votes or 20 percent. Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis had 61,645 votes or 12 percent, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
had 21,622 votes or 4 percent; and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
had 14,686 votes or 3 percent.
   The News Election Service said Bush received 22 delegates, Dole
received 18 and seven were uncommitted, but state GOP officials
predicted a final tabulation would show Bush with 20 delegates,
Dole with 18 and nine uncommitted.
   NES said the discrepancy resulted from not being able to
reprogram its election tabulation computer to accommodate a change
in the complicated district delegate assignment formula.
   Neither Kemp or Robertson qualified for any of Missouri's 47 GOP
delegates at stake.
   The NES results showed Gephardt with 62 delegates, Jackson with
14 and Dukakis with one.

<TEXT>
   Suddenly, maneuver and momentum, strategic ploys and comeback
vows count for little in the campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination. It is a contest of plain numbers now, and
they add up to Vice President George Bush.
   It isn't over, but it isn't open, and won't be unless a
weakened, shrinking field finds a way to stop Bush.
   After his Super Tuesday primary election sweep, on the biggest
election day of a political lifetime, Bush needs little more than
one-third of the Republican national convention delegates yet to be
chosen in order to gain a nominating majority.
   To prevent it, Sen. Bob Dole would have to score a succession of
shutouts and capture more than three-quarters of the delegates left
to be won. Dole says he will storm back in the Illinois primary
next week. But even if Dole does win there, Bush surely will add
significantly to his delegate count.
   And just now, the shutout belongs to Bush: 16 victories, only
two of them even close, and both of those on the borders of Dole's
Kansas home.
   Among Democrats, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. has proven himself a
strong regional candidate in the South, and now must prove that's
not what he is. Gore wagered his campaign on a southern strategy
that defied conventional campaign guideposts, and made it work.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won big, too, at home and
away. Jesse Jackson was a winner as well.
   The Democrats' big three divided 15 states evenly among them.
Dukakis won his home state, and captured two of the biggest prizes
in the south, Texas and Florida. That translated into more than 350
delegates for Dukakis, with Jackson and Gore close behind.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt managed to win only in his Missouri home,
losing in regional competition he once thought was structured to
his advantage.
   Gore bypassed the Iowa and New Hampshire contests after early
forays showed his chances there were negligible. While Gephardt and
Dukakis were splitting those contests, Gore concentrated his time
and, more important, his money on his southern base.
   It worked, and he won front-rank status for the next set of
contests. Now he must compete in the industrial north, beginning
next week in Illinois. That will be a difficult test.
   The political terrain there is promising for the liberal
Dukakis. Jackson's black vote is solid and his base is Chicago.
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon returns to the campaign, at least for a
week, as a favorite son. And while Gephardt is battered, he isn't
finished.
   Gore boasts of his caucus showings in some states outside the
South as evidence that he's more than a regional figure. But he
says realistically that he must prove himself in places like
Illinois, Michigan and Ohio.
   Add New York and Pennsylvania to that lineup, and the schedule
seems made to order for Dukakis.
   While the Massachusetts governor is the Democrat to beat, Bush's
GOP rivals will have to become political magicians to find a way to
stop him.
   Bush's triumph came exactly one month after the Iowa caucuses in
which he ran an embarrassing third, behind Dole and Pat Robertson,
the former television evangelist. Bush then won the New Hampshire
primary, and said that reports of his death had been greatly
exaggerated.
   Dole and Robertson were left to try to fend off the obituaries
this time. Rep. Jack Kemp wasn't even trying that. Kemp, who once
saw the South as a prime target for his conservative campaign, ran
far behind the field, effectively ending his quest.
   As state after state went to Bush, Dole, in Chicago, pronounced
the Illinois primary next Tuesday ``more and more important.''
   ``This is going to be Bob Dole's recovery state,'' he said,
``it's going to be the turnaround state.''
   If it isn't, Illinois could be the farewell state.
   Robertson, whose evangelical supporters are dedicated and
formidable in caucus states, salvaged one victory Tuesday, in the
Washington state caucuses. ``Coming out of Illinois, it's very
possible that it will be a two-man race _ Bush and Robertson,''
said Robertson.
   By way of evidence, he said only that he has the financing to go
all the way to the Republican convention next summer.
   After losing states in bunches, Dole, Robertson and Democrat
Gephardt agreed on one thing: they're glad to be going back to
competition in which one state votes at a time.
   ``I think maybe it was a disservice to the voters to put 20
states on one day,'' said Gephardt, after winning only one of them.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson hammered the
opposition in Virginia's first presidential primary, while Vice
President George Bush swept to another easy victory in his 16-state
clean-up.
   Jackson's campaign leaders had expected a sterling performance
Tuesday from their candidate, who carried the state's presidential
caucuses in 1984.
   ``We laid the groundwork,'' said Mary Cox, Jackson's Virginia
coordinator. ``Our goal was to expand at least 10 to 12 percent
beyond our natural black base, and we've successfully done that.''
   With 1,967 of 1,986 precincts or 99 percent reporting, Jackson
had 161,704 votes or 45 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had
81,139 or 23 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis 78,141 or
22 percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt 16,082 or 4 percent.
   In the Republican race, with 2,298 of 2,391 precincts or 96
percent reporting, Bush had 141,743 votes or 60 percent; Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole had 51,239 or 22 percent, and Virginia native Pat
Robertson had 29,326 or 12 percent. New York Rep. Jack Kemp had
11,490 or 5 percent.
   Jackson, relying on strong support in Hampton Roads and the
Richmond area, overcame Gore's numbers in southwestern Virginia and
Dukakis' power base in Virginia's Washington, D.C., suburbs.
   With 75 of the state Democratic Party's 85 national convention
delegates riding on the outcome, Jackson appeared to have won 37
delegates to 22 for Gore and 16 for Dukakis.
   No GOP delegates were at stake; the 50 national convention
delegates are allocated through local caucuses and mass meetings.
   Boyd Marcus, state coordinator for the Bush campaign, said he
would have been pleased with a mid-40 percent showing. The 2-to-1
win over Dole ``has been the most surprising thing,'' he said.
   Robertson, a former TV evangelist, placed third even in his home
city of Virginia Beach, a showing his supporters had anticipated.
   Anne Kincaid, Robertson's Virginia coordinator, said the former
evangelist ``expected to run third because we hadn't done anything
to broaden his base of support. ... Pat's going to stay in this
thing right through the convention.''

   With the battleground of the South behind them,
the presidential pack turned to Illinois for a week-long campaign
that could be a last stand for some.
   The candidacy of Republican Bob Dole stood in sudden jeopardy
after Vice President George Bush racked up huge wins in the Super
Tuesday states.
   Dole, recalling the days when he recovered from crippling war
wounds at a hospital here, said he is starting his ``road to
recovery'' in the state.
   On the Democratic side, there are other contenders with
something to prove here.
   Sen. Paul Simon, who bypassed the Super Tuesday contests, called
next week's Illinois primary the ``Super Tuesday of the industrial
states.''
   The Illinois senator maintained Tuesday night he can kick his
campaign into gear with a strong home-turf win.
   ``I think we're going to do very well once we get launched in
Illinois,'' he said.
   Chicago-based civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who surged to
the top tier of Democrats with a strong Southern showing, will
continue to court voters outside his black base.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who divvied up Dixie with
Jackson, will try to show he has more than regional appeal. And
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the delegate leader among
Democrats, will be seeking to nail down his dominance here.
   On Tuesday, 113 Democratic and 82 GOP delegates will be chosen.
The remaining 85 will be selected at party meetings.
   Illinois sends the fifth-largest delegations to the Democratic
and Republican national conventions.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who won only his home state on
Super Tuesday, was hoping for a comeback in the northern industrial
states. Gephardt, however, was not expected to mount a major
Illinois campaign.
   Bush, exuberant over his sweep of all 16 states with Republican
primaries, will try to use strong party organization support in
Illinois to bury the opposition for good on the road to New Orleans.
   Rep. Jack Kemp and former television evangelist Pat Robertson
failed to make their way to the front of the GOP field on Super
Tuesday.
   Kemp's campaign looked likely to fold. Robertson, however, had a
caucus win in Washington state to point to, and vowed to fight on.
   Dukakis, attending a rally at a Chicago nightclub as Super
Tuesday results poured in, called Illinois a key state where he
hopes to do well.
   ``I'm somebody who doesn't just talk about economic development
and good jobs,'' Dukakis said. ``I've helped to create them ... and
that's a message that is very important in a state like Illinois.''
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said Tuesday night
that Illinois is important for Jackson, who according to a network
exit poll piled a 10 percent share of the white vote on top of a
near sweep of black votes in Super Tuesday primaries.
   Austin discounted the candidacy of Simon.
   ``Simon did not contest 20 states, and that has removed him from
the list of people who are viable as candidates,'' Austin said.
   Dole, who won only about a sixth as many delegates as Bush did
Tuesday, has challenged Bush to a series of debates reminiscent of
the famous Lincoln-Douglas duels of a more than a century ago. Bush
rejected the challenge.
   ``This is gong to be Bob Dole's recovery state,'' Dole declared
in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook on Tuesday night. ``It's going
to be the turnaround state.''
   Bush is backed by Gov. James R. Thompson, plus 93 of 102 county
leaders and other influential state leaders.
   ``There are no areas we consider ourselves weak,'' said Ed
Murnane, Bush's Illinois deputy campaign director.
   But Dole also has a strong state operation, with coordinators in
all counties and well-known delegate candidates, said campaign
director Mark Schroeder. Dole's organization began shifting forces
to Illinois even before Super Tuesday.
   More than 5.9 million residents are registered to vote in
Tuesday's primary _ the lowest number for any statewide election
since 1982.
   The race is divided into a non-binding presidential preference,
dubbed the ``beauty contest,'' and the selection of delegates
pledged to a candidate or uncommitted.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore were tied in an early tally of presidential preferences of
Nevadans attending the Democratic party's Super Tuesday caucuses.
   With 60 percent of about 6,000 expected preference listings
counted, Jackson and Gore had 30 percent each, while Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had 25 percent.
   The balance included 13 percent uncommitted, 1 percent for
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, and the remaining 1 percent balance
split between Sen. Paul Simon and former Sen. Gary Hart.
   Caucus goers gave Jackson 1,111 votes, Gore 1,102 and Dukakis
951, while 479 were uncommited. Gephardt had 44, Simon 14 and Hart
5.
   Of Jackson's strong showing, state Democratic Chairman Beecher
Avants said, ``It was a real surprise.''
   He had said before the caucuses that he sensed no movement in
the Jackson campaign in Nevada. He noted that Jackson had
considerable support among blacks who represent about 7 percent of
the state's registered voters.
   Gore claimed support from prominent Nevada Democrats such as
Sen. Harry Reid, former Gov. Grant Sawyer and Assembly Speaker Joe
Dini.
   A last-minute mail campaign and telephone blitz were mounted by
backers of Gore and Dukakis. Those two and Jackson made personal
appearances during the campaign.
   Sixteen delegates were at stake in Nevada, to be selected at a
state convention in May. The caucuses were the first stage in
selection of those who will attend the convention.

   Jesse Jackson narrowly beat Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in Alabama's Democratic primary, while Vice
President George Bush outpolled the entire Republican field by
nearly 2-1.
   Bush claimed 35 of Alabama's 38 Republican National Convention
delegates, and Dole the remaining three; Jackson's showing would
give him 30 and Gore would get 26 of the state's 56 Democratic
delegates.
   Both parties drew a record primary turnout.
   With 3,460 of 4,304 precincts, or 80 percent, reporting in the
Republican race, Bush had 124,828 votes or 64 percent; Robert Dole
had 31,562 or 16 percent, Pat Robertson had 27,594 or 15 percent,
and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 9,525, or 5 percent.
   ``The people of this country appreciate that he (Bush) has
worked shoulder-to-shoulder with President Reagan,'' said Bush's
Alabama campaign director, Doug Adair. ``They want the Reagan
revolution to continue.''
   In the Democratic race, with 3,510 of 4,304 precincts, or 82
percent, reporting in the Democratic primary, Jackson had 159,681
votes or 44 percent to Gore's 134,053 votes, or 37 percent.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis got 28,050 votes or 8 percent,
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt 26,516, or 7 percent, and Gary Hart
6,586 or 2 percent.
   ``We expected it to be close,'' said Youlanda Curtis, Jackson's
state coordinator. Jackson, the lopsided favorite in black
precincts, drew a small but apparently critical number of white
votes in his narrow margin over Gore.
   The Democratic voter turnout for Super Tuesday was expected at
near 450,000; the old record was 423,000 in 1984. The GOP record
for a presidential primary was 211,000 in 1980; more than 230,000
were estimated voting Tuesday.
   Jackson's victory was a landmark in voting rights history in
Alabama, the site of the Selma-to-Montgomery march that led to the
1965 Voting Rights Act, opening the ballot box to blacks across the
South.

<HEAD>Gore Strategy Works but South Still Far From Solid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. bet on Dixie and won but the South still
proved anything but solid and allowed two other Democratic
presidential candidates to claim victory as well.
   Jesse Jackson exulted in the success of a ``new Southern
message'' and boasted: ``We've gone from a narrow mainstream to a
broad-based river.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis gained bragging rights of his
own with victories in the two biggest Super Tuesday states: Texas
and Florida.
   The result was a fractured outcome that partially served the
aims of the architects of Super Tuesday, who wanted a moderate
Democrat and maybe even a Southern one to emerge from the primaries
across the South.
   Gore ran as that moderate and his victories in five states
propel him to the next round of primaries. ``Super Tuesday
succeeded,'' said a Gore booster, former Gov. Charles Robb of
Virginia.
   But Dukakis' six victories and Jackson's five were potent
reminders of the law of unintended consequences in politics. And
the evening's biggest winner was a Republican _ George Bush, who
won 16 out of 16 primaries to take a commanding lead in the GOP
race.
   ``Super Tuesday is not what I had hoped it would be,'' declared
Charles Whitehead, the Democratic Party chief in Florida. ``If I
had to speculate, I would say that there will be some changes
before the next election four years from now.''
   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida said, ``It's ironic that the governor
of Massachusetts most perceptively figured out the significance of
the new rules in the South.''
   Added Texan Jim Wright, the House speaker: ``If it was designed
to produce a unified conservative Southern candidate, I would say
those who dreamed it up outsmarted themselves.''
   Still, the most dire prediction by Southern Democrats didn't
materialize either: an exodus of disgruntled Democratic voters to
the competing Republican primaries.
   Southern Republicans had hoped to capitalize on the Democrats'
division by attracting Democratic voters in the eight states where
cross-over voting was permitted. The prospect even led Lee Atwater,
Republican George Bush's campaign manager, to taunt before the
balloting that the Democratic designed Super Tuesday would prove
``the political boo-boo of the decade.''
   As it turned out, crossovers to the GOP proved largely
insignificant.
   Gore established himself as a solid contender by winning five
states: Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, North Carolina and Oklahoma.
   Jackson won Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and
Mississippi. With overwhelming black support and a divided white
vote, he moved far beyond his 1984 campaign which won only one
state.
   ``We're the underdog with the biggest bite,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis won in his home state of Massachusetts as well as in
neighboring Rhode Island, in Maryland, Idaho and in the two
mega-states of Florida and Texas.
   Gore immediately looked ahead to the next round of industrial
states of the North _ where he now must show he is more than a
regional candidate.
   ``I am not a Southern candidate,'' declared the man who ran as a
son of the South in the Super Tuesday contests.
   ``I'm a national candidate who's a Southerner and proud of it,''
Gore said.
   He was leaving today for Chicago before dashing to South
Carolina, where he hopes to pick up delegates at that state's
Democratic caucuses on Saturday.
   After succeeding with a strategy that pummeled rival Richard
Gephardt with a torrent of negative ads, Gore pointed to Dukakis as
his chief rival.
   ``This is becoming a two-person race between Michael Dukakis and
Al Gore,'' Gore said. ``It's a race between the politics of the
past and the politics of the future.''
   Gore began suggesting that Dukakis has an ``electability''
problem _ that despite winning the two biggest states of the South
in the Democratic primary, he is too Northern, too liberal and too
ethnic to carry those states or the region against the Republcans.
   Dukakis scoffed at the claim, noting that he won more delegates
and more votes than Gore on the Tennessean's chosen battlefield.
   With the Democratic field splintered into three parts, Gore,
Jackson and Dukakis all got big chunks of delegates.
   ``This has been a great night for us,'' said Dukakis. ``To be
able to take Texas and Florida, the two big ones, and to do well
across the board demonstrates that this is a national candidacy, a
national campaign.''
   Gephardt blamed his failure on a lack of money and vowed to go
on to the next round of primaries. He criticized the Super Tuesday
process with 20 states voting on a single day _ an arrangement that
left his money-strapped campaign hard pressed to keep up.
   ``I think maybe it was a disservice to the voters to put 20
states on one day,'' he said.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Britain vetoed a
Security Council resolution to impose economic sanctions on South
Africa, saying such mandatory penalties would stifle chances for
internal reform.
   The measure was aimed at putting pressure on South Africa to end
apartheid, that country's system of legalized racial segregation.
It would have imposed mandatory worldwide sanctions, including an
oil embargo, for a year.
   It failed by a vote of 10-2, with France, West Germany and Japan
abstaining.
   Prior to the vote Tuesday, all speakers deplored white
minority-led South Africa's state of emergency and recent
restrictions on anti-apartheid groups.
   But British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell and U.S. Ambassador
Herbert Okun both told the council mandatory sanctions would
cripple the chances for an ``internal'' dialogue in South Africa.
   The West German envoy, Alexander Count York von Wartenburg, gave
a similar reason for abstaining.
   But he also warned South Africa that the West German abstention
is ``a signal that my government's patience is not inexhaustible.''
   The French and Japanese envoys did not explain their abstention.
   The resolution called for a one-year ban on export and sale of
oil to South Africa, on iron and steel imports, on the sale of all
South African coins and on investment and loans. It also called for
an end to all promotion and support for trade with South Africa.
   The United States, Britain and West Germany have vetoed similar
measures in the past. The United States and Britain are among the
five permanent members with veto power. The others are China,
France and the Soviet Union.
   African and Asian nations pushed hard for the sanctions to
punish South Africa for its Feb. 24 ban on activities by major anti
anti-apartheid groups, and to force it to dismantle apartheid,
under which the 26 million blacks have no say in national affairs.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government and the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.
   The council members belonging to the movement of nations
professing non-alliance with either superpower _ Argentina, Nepal,
Senegal, Yugoslavia and Zambia _ sponsored the resolution.

<HEAD>Labor Department Rules Against Bank in Discrimination Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ruling by the Labor Department against a
Chicago bank could expand by several thousand the number of people
eligible to share in $12.2 milllion in back pay awarded to group of
employees in the government's biggest case against federal
contractors on charges of sexual and racial bias.
   Nahum Litt, an administrative law judge, Tuesday ruled Harris
Trust and Savings Bank is liable for back pay to all women and
minority employees on its payroll from 1974 until Dec. 22, 1986
unless it can prove it ceased its alleged discriminatory policies
before then.
   Originally, only 1,300 employees were to share in the award
under another law judge's decision against the bank in 1981.
   But the amount of back pay ``could easily climb into the low 20s
(in millions of dollars) if Harris is unable to show it has ceased
discrimination,'' said George Salem, the Labor Department's
solictor.
   Litt also ruled that the amount of back pay will be determined
through a formula originially developed by a consultant hired by
Harris and adopted by the Labor Department but opposed by the bank.
   Harris has maintained all along that it has not discriminated
against women and blacks, said Tom Abram, a Chicago attorney
representing the bank.
   ``This is just a ruling by an administrative law judge, which is
subject to review by the secretary of labor and ultimately by the
courts,'' Abram said. ``We contend ultimately there will be a
vindication of the bank that there has been no violation of the
exeuctive order for any time period.''
   The case, dates back to 1977 and marks a decade of legal
wrangling in the first and biggest ever litigated under a 1965
presidential order requiring federal contractors to refrain from
discrimination against minorities and women in their hiring,
promotion and wage policies.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce tried unsuccessfully in 1985 to persuade President Reagan
to repeal the executive order, arguing that remedies requiring the
use of affirmative action goals and timetables amount to reverse
discimination.
   Nancy Kreiter of Chicago's Women Employed, a group involved in
the original charges, said Litt's ruling Tuesday ``ups the ante ...
and puts new major pressure on the bank to settle.''
   ``It brings us one step forward in getting the case over with
and getting the money into the hands of the victims,'' she said.
   Attorneys for both the Labor Department and the bank
acknowledged they have been negotiating a possible settlement.

   Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame football
coach being honored this week by his government, was a raw-boned
Norwegian immigrant whose locker-room orations inspired the
Fighting Irish to three national championships and indirectly
helped make Ronald Reagan a star.
   A master at motivating his players with such pleas as ``Win one
for the Gipper,'' Rockne was killed on March 31, 1931, in an
airplane crash that stunned the nation. He remains a giant figure
in the school's _ and the country's _ football legend.
   Reagan, who played the Gipper in a 1940 movie, was going to
Notre Dame today for the issuance of a commemorative postage stamp
in Rockne's honor. The 22-cent stamp is the sixth in a sports
series that also includes Bobby Jones, Babe Zaharias, Babe Ruth,
Roberto Clemente and Jim Thorpe.
   Rockne was born in Voss, Norway, in 1888, came to the United
States with his parents in 1893 and grew up in the Logan Square
district of Chicago. After high school, he worked as a mail
dispatcher for four years to save enough money to attend Notre Dame.
   He lettered in track, was a semi-pro boxer, wrote for the
student newspaper and yearbook, played flute in the orchestra and
paid his way by working as a janitor and as a chemistry research
assistant.
   As a football player, Rockne was credited with making the
forward pass a legitimate offensive weapon, although he was a
receiver for quarterback Gus Dorais. The pass first gained
widespread notice in the 1913 Notre Dame-Army game at West Point,
and the series became one of college football's greatest
intersectional rivalries.
   As coach, a post he assumed in 1918, Rockne made the Fighting
Irish a standard for college football in an increasingly
sports-hungry nation.
   ``We heard about Red Grange and Illinois, of course. But the
idea of a team with a real national reputation was almost unheard
of when I was a young man,'' said Hugh Devore, who served as Irish
head coach in 1948 and in 1963. ``But Rockne changed that because
he would go anywhere to play anyone.''
   It was in 1924 that the most famous backfield in college
football history _ Elmer Layden, Don Miller, Harry Stuhldreher and
Jim Crowley, better known as the Four Horsemen _ gained recognition
in a 13-7 victory over Army.
   The 1928 meeting was the game immortalized in ``Knute Rockne _
All American,'' starring Pat O'Brien and the young Reagan.
   As the story goes, Notre Dame trailed 6-0 at halftime. Then
Rockne inspired the Irish by recounting a deathbed scene eight
years earlier in which All-American George Gipp, stricken with
strep throat, told his coach:
   ``I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some
time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are wrong
and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with
all they've got and win just one for the Gipper.
   ``I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it,
and I'll be happy.''
   The fired-up Irish came back with two touchdowns in the second
half and won 12-6.
   As to whether the Gipper deathbed story is true, former athletic
director Edward ``Moose`` Krause says, ``I wasn't there, but I've
talked to guys who were ... They swear it happened just like in the
movies.''
   The Irish were undefeated the next two seaons. Then an era came
to an end when a plane carrying the 43-year-old Rockne to
California to make a football demonstration movie flew into a
storm, became covered with ice and fell into a wheat field near
Bazaar, Kan. Seven other people also died.
   ``You would have thought the world had come to an end,''
recalled Krause, then a freshman.
   Rockne's funeral Mass on the Notre Dame campus was broadcast
across the country.
   ``Everybody looked on Rockne as a God. I was in awe of him,''
said Krause, who was athletic director for 32 years until his
retirement in 1981 and will be part of Wednesday's program at the
university's Athletic and Convocation Center.
   During his 13 years as Notre Dame's coach, Rockne won 105 games,
lost 12 and tied five for an .897 percentage. He also also served
as athletic director, business manager, ticket distributor, track
coach and equipment manager, wrote a newspaper column once a week
and was the principal designer of the current Notre Dame Stadium.
   He and his wife, Bonnie, had four children. A daughter, Mrs.
Anthony Kochendorfer of Tulsa, Okla., is expected to be at Notre
Dame for the ceremony.
   Besides Gipp and the Four Horsemen, other All-Americans who
played for Rockne included Roger Kiley, Johnny Mohardt, Harvey
Brown, Art Boeringer, John Smith, Frank Carideo, Jack Cannon, Joe
Savoli, Bert Metzger, Tom Conley and Marchy Schwartz.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Declines To Help FBI Keep Documents Secret</HEAD>

   The federal prosecutor in a case against Lyndon
LaRouche refused to represent the FBI in its bid to keep from
defense lawyers classified files concerning the political extremist
and figures in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The unusual move Tuesday by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham
delayed consideration of whether the defense will get the
documents. Several of the defense lawyers, charging that the
government improperly withheld evidence, asked that the case be
dismissed.
   LaRouche, six followers and five LaRouche political
organizations all are charged with conspiring to cover up alleged
credit card fraud by LaRouche supporters during his 1984
presidential campaign. Four of the organizations are charged with
fraud.
   Markham told U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton he could not
represent the FBI because of a conflict of interest with his role
as prosecutor. Markham did not elaborate, but said the conflict
would be resolved before a hearing scheduled for this afternoon.
   At that hearing, the FBI either might have to drop its request
or present evidence that releasing the documents would be
detrimental to national security. Keeton deferred ruling on the
dismissal motions until after the questions about access to the FBI
records is resolved.
   One of the defense lawyers sought the FBI documents after
obtaining a May 1986 memo that involves two key players in the
Iran-Contra scandal and mentions an apparent effort to collect
information damaging to LaRouche.
   In the memo, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord told
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the National Security Council aide
fired for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, that ``our man here
claims Lewis has collected info against LaRouche.''
   Defense lawyer William Moffitt said Markham told him ``our man''
referred to Oliver Revell, the FBI's executive assistant director.
Markham refused to confirm that. Moffitt also said he had confirmed
that ``Lewis'' was a retired Army major, Fred Lewis.
   The memo, found in North's safe, was surrendered to LaRouche
defense lawyers after the special prosecutor investigating the
scandal acknowledged its existence.
   Secord, reached Tuesday in Washington, said he could not recall
the memo but never crossed paths with LaRouche. Secord was one of
North's principal operatives in the network of private aid to the
anti-Nicaraguan Contras.
   Defense lawyers contend that the Reagan administration plotted
to ruin LaRouche, who is seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination in his fourth run for the White House. He faces up to
five years in prison if convicted.
   Prosecutors deny defense contentions that the government
infilitrated LaRouche's organzations and concocted a credit card
fraud scheme to destroy LaRouche and his following.
   The defense, however, has presented evidence in recent weeks
that the FBI had infiltrated LaRouche organizations as recently as
1985.
   Keeton told Markham he wants an explanation as to why defense
lawyers, through Freedom of Information Act requests, have learned
of the existence of thousands of other FBI documents mentioning
LaRouche but not turned over to defense lawyers before the trial.

   Pat Robertson's ``invisible army'' forged the
only Super Tuesday victory for the former television evangelist, as
he swept past Sen. Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush in
Washington's Republican caucuses.
   It took fewer than 10,000 foot soldiers to accomplish the
victory that eluded Robertson in his native South. Robertson's
success had been predicted, since his vaunted organizational
juggernaut works best in caucus states.
   Democratic leaders projected a victory for Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, basing their assessment on bellwether Democratic
precincts. The Democratic counting could take a week, officials
said.
   Jesse Jackson ran a strong and surprisingly close second,
pulling within a few percentage points of Dukakis early today.
   Dukakis had been the runaway favorite going into the caucuses
and carried the blessings of Gov. Booth Gardner and other state
Democratic heavyweights. His campaign was the best organized and
had more paid staffers than all five of his competitors combined.
   Uncommitted Democratic slates placed third, and Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois were dueling for
fourth place. Before Simon's announcement of a campaign moratorium
for Super Tuesday states, he had been projected as the second-place
finisher.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and former Sen. Gary Hart
received little support.
   With 4,650 GOP precinct caucuses counted, or 71 percent,
Robertson led the Republicans with 39 percent, Dole had 26 percent,
and Bush, the big winner in the South, was third with 24 percent.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp was a weak fourth, with 8 percent, and
uncommitted slates were favored by 3 percent of the voters.
   The vote tally was Robertson 5,921; Dole 3,952; Bush 3,688; Kemp
1,140; and uncommitted 444.
   If the proportions hold during the later two steps of national
delegate selection, Robertson will get 16 delegates, Dole 11, Bush
10, Kemp 3 and uncommitted 1.
   For the Democrats, with about 2,000 bellwether precincts
reporting, Dukakis was projected the winner with 40 percent.
   Jackson, who campaigned little in Washington, had 37.5 percent,
but state Democratic Chairwoman Karen Marchioro predicted Dukakis
will increase his margin when the other two-thirds of the precincts
report.
   That could take a week, she said.
   Uncommitted slates were winning more than 12 percent of the
vote, followed by Gore at 4.5 percent and Simon at 4.3 percent.
   Gephardt had less than 2 percent. Hart, the state's favorite
four years ago, barely registered, with less than 1 percent.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar steadied against European
currencies and the Japanese yen today after falling sharply against
a surging British pound. Gold was unchanged to slightly lower.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8340, compared
with $1.8415 Tuesday, and eased down from a high of 3.09 West
German marks to 3.065.
   ``We think the pound will stabilize around these levels,'' said
a trader with a Frankfurt bank. ``Its rise was too sharp and too
fast.''
   The pound has gained a massive 10 cents this week, powered by
high British interest rates. Although the Bank of England has
intervened to stem the rise, it was strengthened further by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher ruling out a cut in interest rates.
   In Tokyo the dollar rose 0.28 yen to a closing 128.08. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 128.23 yen.
   A dealer in Rome speculated that Vice President George Bush's
triumph in the Super Tuesday primaries may also have calmed
markets, because he is perceived here as an anti-protectionist.
   The dollar, trading in a narrow range, was little changed from
late Tuesday. Some rates:
   _1.6718 West German marks, up from 1.6668
   _1.3810 Swiss francs, up from 1.3790
   _5.6590 French francs, down from 5.6625
   _1.8774 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8780
   _1.233.00 Italian lire, down from 1,234.00
   _1.2545 Canadian dollar, up from 1.2524
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $435.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $438.10. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$436.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $435.80, down from $436.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose one cent to close at a bid
$438.01.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.28 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.36.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis rode an
endorsement by Hawaii's top elected Democrats to a narrow victory
over Jesse Jackson in a presidential preference poll at the state's
Democratic Party caucuses.
   With all but about a dozen of 283 precincts reporting, Dukakis
had 2,026 votes, while Jackson had 1,470. None of the other
candidates or the choice of ``uncommitted'' had enough votes to
qualify for any of the state's 20 pledged delegates to the
Democratic National Convention.
   Party officials were analyzing the results today to determine
the allocation of the pledged delegates, but it appeared Dukakis
would get 12 delegates and Jackson 8.
   In endorsing Dukakis, Gov. John Waihee was joined by Sens.
Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, Rep. Daniel Akaka, Lt. Gov.
Benjamin Cayetano, and the mayors of Hawaii and Kauai islands.
   Waihee said he was not surprised by Jackson's strong showing and
said it was ``healthy for the Democratic Party.''
   Jackson supporters signed up about 2,000 new party members prior
to the caucuses.
   The Jackson campaign claimed victory with their strong showing
against the endorsement of the Democratic establishment.
   ``Jackson's showing in Hawaii puts an end to the belief that
Jesse Jackson is not electable, and to the belief that Jackson can
win only in states with large black populations,'' said Richard
Port, manager of the Jackson campaign in Hawaii.
   The votes of other candidates were Richard Gephardt, 83; Paul
Simon, 46; Albert Gore, 41; Gary Hart, 83; and ``uncommitted,'' 183.

   Only 36 Democrats took part
presidential preference caucuses in this South Pacific territory,
dividing their support between Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   The Democrats rejected a call by party leaders in American Samoa
to endorse an uncommitted slate of delegates to the Democratic
National Convention.
   American Samoa was the smallest player in Super Tuesday, with
three delegates available and about 300 Democrats eligible to take
part in the meetings.
   National Committeeman Glenn Jones said 36 Democrats attended the
caucuses. He said few voters turned out probably because the
territory has no electoral votes in the presidential election.
   Of the 36 votes cast, 14 went for Dukakis, eight for Gephardt,
and two for Jesse Jackson. The remaining 12 were uncommitted.
   That means that Dukakis and Gephardt will have one delegate
each, and the third member of the American Samoa delegation will be
uncommitted.
   Jones said that of all the candidates, only Jackson's campaign
had contacted party officials for convention support.
   ``We would rather wait to see where the trend is going ... who
doesn't make the cut,'' said Party Chairman Utu R.M. Sinagege.

   At least $1.7 million fell into the street
from an armored truck, and when a crowd gathered up the cash at
least three people made off with $500,000, police said.
   Two unidentified men and a woman disappeared Tuesday afternoon
with cash-stuffed money bags scattered from a crate that fell out
of the moving Loomis Armored Inc. truck in the city's Mission
District.
   ``(They) decided they were going to take advantage of what
happened, threw the bags into their cars and left,'' said police
officer Harry Soulette.
   Soulette said he was flagged down by the Loomis truck driver,
who was unaware of the loss until a motorist honked his horn and
told him the door of the truck was ajar, Soulette said.
   Two blocks back, a crowd gathered around the crate, which postal
worker Daniel Higginbotham moved to the sidewalk. Some people
helped him gather the bags, recovering about $1.2 million, police
said. Some didn't.
   ``There was a gentleman from the Post Office grabbing bags of
money out of people's hands and putting them back in the (crate),''
Soulette said. ``At least three people looked at him and told him
what he could do with his suggestion.'' Others may have taken a few
bags and fled on foot, police said. It's not a case of finders
keepers, Soulette said. If caught, the money-grubbers face grand
theft charges. ``That's a felony. My advice to them is to turn it
in,'' Soulette said.
   Witnesses gave detailed descriptions of the two men and the
woman, who each took several bags, and their cars, Soulette said.
   One man picked up two sacks and returned them immediately to the
company, police said. Louis A. Lopez, of Daly City, drove straight
to Loomis to hand over two bags containing $40,100 in cash,
Soulette said.
   Neither Lopez nor Higginbotham could be reached for comment
Tuesday night.
   The money had come from different banks and businesses. The
truck was on the way back to Loomis and was several blocks away
when the door, which may not have been closed securely, sprang
open, Soulette said.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate George Bush
was the clear-cut winner on Super Tuesday, capturing the largest
delegate prize, while Michael Dukakis led a three-way Democratic
race in the primaries and caucuses.
   Dukakis led among the Democrats with 386 delegates for a total
of 455.5, but Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. were
hot on the heels of the Massachusetts governor.
   Jackson picked up 366 delegates for a total of 393.55 while Gore
collected 326 delegates for a total of 347.8.
   The close finish among the three Democrats fueled the theory of
Sen. Paul Simon's campaign that Super Tuesday would produce a
``gridlock'' of delegates, making it unlikely that any candidate
would gain a majority of the delegates after the last round of
primaries in June.
   Bush, who amassed 578 delegates with wins in 16 primaries, has
62 percent of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination
_ a total of 705. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was a distant second,
collecting 98 delegates for a total of 163.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson won 9 delegates for a
total of 17 and New York Rep. Jack Kemp added four delegates to his
previous total of 35. Thirty-five delegates remain uncommitted.
   Simon, who bypassed the Super Tuesday contests to concentrate on
the primary in his home state of Illinois, slated for next week,
gained no delegates and stands at his previous total of 35.5.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt apparently failed to get his message
across in the Southern and border states, capturing just 93
delegates, including 61 of 77 in his home state of Missouri.
Gephardt emerged from Super Tuesday with a total of 143 delegates.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had no delegates, and 259.65 are
uncommitted.
   In Minnesota, the state Democratic Party released results from
its Feb. 23 precinct caucuses, which had been kept under seal until
Super Tuesday at the demand of the national party. The results were
so incomplete, however, that a national figure could not be
calculated for 78 of Minnesota's delegates.
   Going into Super Tuesday, Bush held 127 GOP delegates and
Dukakis had 69.5 Democratic delegates.
   Dole began the day with 65 delegates, Robertson had eight and 12
Republican delegates chosen before Tuesday were uncommitted.
   Gephardt had 50 Democratic delegates before Tuesday's balloting,
Jackson had 27.55, Gore had 21.8, and 254.65 were uncommitted. In
addition to delegates picked through primaries or caucuses, those
totals included Democratic ``super delegates,'' the party leaders,
governors and others who will automatically hold seats as delegates
to the national convention.
   Under Democratic Party rules, some of the ``super delegates''
cast fractional votes.
   In all, 4,162 delegates are to attend the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta in July and 2,277 delegates will attend the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans in August. Winning
the Democratic presidential nomination will require support from at
least 2,082 delegates.

<HEAD>Britain Demands Envoy Waive Immunity, Hints at Expulsion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain demanded today that the Panamanian
ambassador waive his diplomatic immunity and face police
questioning about a raid he authorized to seize control of his
country's London consulate.
   The Foreign Office said it expected an answer from Ambassador
Guillermo Vega by the end of the day, and warned that expulsion
``remains an option.''
   Vega was summoned to the Foreign Office twice Tuesday to explain
Monday night's seizure, an extension of the struggle for control of
Panama's government.
   Representatives of Vega, accompanied by hired security guards,
crashed a Land Rover through the glass doors of the consulate on
Fleet Street and occupied the offices.
   Vega supports Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who engineered the ouster of President Eric Delvalle Feb. 26.
Consul Eduardo Arango, whose offices were seized, is loyal to
Delvalle.
   The Foreign Office said it asked Vega and embassy counselor
Jorge E. Constantino to waive their diplomatic immunity so that
police can question them about the incident.
   ``We haven't given him a deadline as such. We made it clear that
we want to hear (a reply) today,'' said a spokesman who, under
British civil service rules, cannot be identified.
   Under international law, accredited diplomats are immune from
police action but can be expelled if the host government believes
them guilty of misconduct.
   Seven Britons were arrested and charged with public order
offenses for alleged roles in the consulate raid.
   The Times quoted Foreign Office Minister Timothy Eggar as
saying: ``What is at issue here is whether any Panamanian Embassy
official has taken the law into his own hands. The British
government will not tolerate any such action.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament Tuesday:
``Differences of opinion should not be fought out on London
streets.''
   Vega has said the raid had his authority, and that the consulate
was ``full of outsiders to the Panamanian government.''
   Control of the Panamanian Embassy in Washington is also in
dispute.
   Delvalle was ousted hours after he ordered Noriega to step down.
The general was indicted in Florida last month on federal drug
trafficking charges.
   The Reagan administration says it still considers Delvalle
Panama's chief of state. The Thatcher government has not stated a
position on the matter.

honored as nation's the most courageous and most ethical engineer.
   Allan J. McDonald, a vice president of Morton Thiokol Corp.,
received an honorary award Tuesday from Design News magazine, said
Steve Thompson, the publisher of the magazine.
   ``Al McDonald was the one guy who tried to stop it,'' said
Thompson, who presented the magazine's awards at a banquet in
Chicago.
   ``He had the courage to stand up to the whole world and say
`look, you can't do this' _ that's why he's special.''
   A Presidential commission has blamed the Challenger disaster on
a flaw in a booster rocket built by Morton Thiokol. Seven
astronauts died in the explosion.
   During a speech after receiving the award, McDonald, 50, said he
hopes the Challenger disaster does not leave the nation's space
program paralyzed.
   ``My biggest concern is that we've lost the nerve to ever fly
anything again,'' McDonald said. ``We think we have to have
complete safety. I don't think we will ever have that.''
   McDonald said the space shuttle will be ready for its next
scheduled launch in August.
   ``One thing worse than failure is not to try,'' he said.
   Also honored Tuesday was Elbert Rutan, who designed the Voyager,
the first aircraft to fly around the world without refueling. Rutan
was voted best engineer by the magazine's 750,000 readers, Thompson
said.

<HEAD>Autopsy Inconclusive on Divine; Director Pays Tribute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary autopsy on the body of
300-pound female impersonator Divine, star of the cult film classic
``Pink Flamingos,'' failed to pinpoint a cause of death, coroner's
officials said.
   The 42-year-old actor, whose real name was Harris Glenn
Milstead, was found dead in his bed Monday at the Hollywood Regency
Plaza Hotel.
   The Los Angeles County coroner's office has ordered a
microscopic examination of tissue samples, but preliminary tests
taken Tuesday showed no signs of trauma or any other factor that
would have contributed to the actor's death, coroner's spokesman
Steve Stewart said.
   Drugs and alcohol are unlikely to have caused the death of
Milstead, his manager said. Publicist John West of PMK said the
actor apparently died of asphyxiation.
   John Waters, director of ``Hairspray'' and ``Pink Flamingos''
who grew up with Milstead in Baltimore, read a tribute to his
friend Tuesday afternoon at a downtown Baltimore hotel.
   ``Not only did I respect him as the best actor I've ever worked
with, I knew him personally as a kind and gentle man,'' Waters
said, his voice catching. ``A huge portion of the success of my
film is owed him. ... Divine is as irreplaceable to me as a member
of my own family. I'll miss him incredibly.''
   Manager Bernard Jay said Milstead had a long-term weight
problem, but except for that was found to be in excellent health
during a medical checkup last Friday.
   ``He was not on drugs at all, and he never drank alcohol,'' Jay
said. ``I suppose it all comes down to his weight. He was
constantly trying to diet, but as soon as he'd take the pounds off,
they'd come right back on again.''
   Milstead was in town to appear in an episode of ``Married ...
With Children,'' a Fox Television Network series.
   He had been pleased over critical praise for his role in
``Hairspray'' as Edna Turnblad, the fat mother of a fat teen-age
girl.
   ``He'd call me in the middle of the night to read me some
newspaper interview and say, ``Isn't it wonderful! They called me
Divine, the 300-pound actor, not Divine, the 300-pound
transvestite,'' Jay said.
   A native of Lutherville, Md., Milstead's came to fame as the
bizarre star of ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Lust in the Dust,''
``Polyester'' and ``Female Trouble.''
   Milstead played one full non-transvestite role in his career,
that of a Sydney Greenstreet-type character in the 1985 film
``Trouble In Mind.''
   Besides film roles, Milstead also used the Divine persona in a
nightclub act.
   Waters said that the last time he had spoken to Divine was two
days ago, and he had last seen him at the premiere of ``Hairspray''
in New York City.
   In their last conversations, Waters said, ``he was just so
happy. He said `Can you believe we came this far?'''

   Here, at a glance, are results from the Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALABAMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson had expected to win comfortably on the strength of
a sizable black vote, but instead narrowly defeated Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., who was endorsed by Sen. Howell Heflin. Vice
President George Bush swamped Kansas Sen. Bob Dole just as expected.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AMERICAN SAMOA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats in the South Pacific territory, smallest of Super
Tuesday's players, chose one national convention delegate for
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, one for Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, and one uncommitted. Only 36 people voted at party
caucuses.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARKANSAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore won with 36 percent, Dukakis had 19 percent and Jackson had
17 percent. Gov. Bill Clinton said Gore benefited from undecided
voters, and the big surprise was the fourth place, 12 percent
showing of Gephardt. Bush won with nearly half the vote.
   Rep. Bill Alexander won re-election to an 11th term, defeating
political consultant Darrell Glascock by 2-1 in the Democratic
primary. Alexander is unopposed in the general election.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FLORIDA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis found a warm reception from transplanted Northerners and
pulled in 39 percent of the vote to Jackson's 20 percent. Bush took
advantage of President Reagan's popularity, Gov. Bob Martinez'
endorsement and family ties (his son Jeb is secretary of commerce)
to trounce Dole nearly 3-1.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson won by piling up margins of better than 8-1 over Gore
and Dukakis in the 5th Congressional District, composed largely of
the city of Atlanta. The heavy black vote outweighed Gore's
endorsements by Sen. Sam Nunn and Gov. Joe Frank Harris. Bush beat
Dole better than 2-1.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HAWAII</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Endorsements by the state's top Democrats were credited with
helping Dukakis defeat Jackson at Hawaii's Democratic Party
caucuses by nearly a 3-2 margin. Gov. John Waihee, who backed
Dukakis, said he wasn't surprised by Jackson's strong showing and
called it ``healthy for the Democratic Party.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IDAHO (caucus)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis captured 8 of 18 uncommitted delegates, with Jackson
winning 4 and 6 going to the state convention uncommitted. Gov.
Cecil Andrus, who says he will go to the convention uncommitted,
said the turning point in the Dukakis campaign was a last-minute
visit to Boise last weekend. Jackson's strong showing was a
surprise because the state has a minority population of less than 5
percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>KENTUCKY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore won his neighboring state with help from Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson, gaining 46 percent of the vote to Dukakis' 18 percent.
Bush's 59 percent vote was termed ``astounding'' by his state
campaign chairman, Rep. Harold ``Hal'' Rogers, who had predicted a
48 percent victory.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LOUISIANA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson edged Gore 34 percent to 29 percent despite Gore's
endorsement by Democratic Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer. Bush breezed to
victory with 59 percent, leaving Dole and Roberston each with 18
percent.
   In the 4th Congressional District race to replace Roemer, his
former congressional aide Jim McCrery, a Republican, and Democratic
state Sen. Foster Campbell claimed spots in an April 16 runoff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MARYLAND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson finished second to Dukakis, 31 percent to 43 percent,
with a strong showing in the two predominantly black congressional
districts. Bush carried all eight districts even though he didn't
campaign personally in Maryland, while Dole did spend some time in
the state. Bush led 53 percent to 32 percent.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes easily won nomination for a third
term and will be opposed by millionaire businessman Thomas Blair, a
newcomer to politics.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MASSACHUSETTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis' home state gave him 59 percent of the vote. Jackson was
second with 19 percent. The win at home and victories in Florida
and Texas gave Dukakis the three biggest Super Tuesday prizes.
Bush, who was born in Massachusetts, got 59 percent of the vote to
Dole's 26 percent. Gordon Nelson, state co-chairman for New York
Rep. Jack Kemp's campaign, said Bush convinced voters he was
Reagan's logical successor: ``George Bush won because he is Reagan
II.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MISSISSIPPI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush and Jackson rang up big victories, with Jackson helped by
turnout in the heavily black Delta that enabled him to defeat Gore.
   In a Democratic primary for the seat of retiring Sen. John
Stennis, voters chose Rep. Wayne Dowdy to oppose GOP Rep. Trent
Lott in November.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MISSOURI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush won a narrow victory in Dole's backyard, getting 42 percent
of the vote to Dole's 41 percent. Bush pulled ahead with returns
from St. Louis County. Gephardt easily won his home state with 58
percent of the vote, but it was his only victory Tuesday. Jackson
was second with 21 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEVADA (caucus)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore won in a tally at Nevada's Democratic caucuses, with
Dukakis second and Jackson a surprisingly strong third. In
balloting for county convention delegates, Gore, who got support
from Sen. Harry Reid and other top state Democrats, had 33 percent
to Dukakis' 26 and Jackson's 22. Party chairman Beecher Avants said
Jackson's strong showing ``was a real surprise.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NORTH CAROLINA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dole lost his wife's home state as Bush emphasized his ties to
President Reagan. Bush had 45 percent to Dole's 40 percent of the
GOP vote. Endorsements from such key Democrats as Sen. Terry
Sanford and former Gov. Jim Hunt helped Gore squeeze past Jackson
35 percent to 33 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OKLAHOMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore got 41 percent of the vote, almost double his nearest
competitor, Gephardt. Gore's victory margin was a surprise because
a recent poll showed him in a tie with Gephardt and Dukakis. But he
visited the state several times and spent more on advertising than
any other Democrat. As expected, the GOP contest was close, with
Bush capturing 37 percent of the vote and Dole 35 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RHODE ISLAND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush and Dukakis continued their New England sweeps, with the
vice president winning 65 percent of the GOP vote and the governor
from neighboring Massachusetts getting nearly 70 percent of the
Democratic vote. Bush had built up good will through previous
campaign journeys on behalf of Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and Rep.
Claudine Schneider.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TENNESSEE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore's home state gave him about 74 percent of the vote, leaving
Jackson, with 19 percent, a distant second. Bush trounced Dole
nearly 3-1.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TEXAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis won the top delegate state with 33 percent of the vote.
Bush, who built an oil business in Texas, crushed all his rivals,
receiving 65 percent of the vote. Robertson got 15 percent and Dole
14 percent.
   Democratic U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen easily won renomination for a
fourth term. Rep. Beau Boulter and Wes Gilbreath, a Houston
investor, advance to GOP runoff for U.S. Senate. The winner faces
Bentsen in November.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VIRGINIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson received 45 percent of the vote, with Gore far behind at
23 percent and Dukakis with 22 percent. Jackson got strong support
in Hampton Roads and the Richmond area, overcoming Gore's numbers
in southwestern Virginia and Dukakis' power base in suburbs near
Washington, D.C. Boyd Marcus, Bush's state coordinator, said he
would have been pleased with a mid-40 percent showing. The 2-to-1
win over Dole (60 percent to 22 percent) ``has been the most
surprising thing,'' he said.Virginia native Robertson had 12
percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON(caucus)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Robertson's 38 percent of the vote gave him his only victory of
Super Tuesday. Dole had 27 percent, and Bush was third, his only
loss of the night, with 24 percent. To claim their share of the
state's 41 GOP delegates, the candidates will have to fare as well
in this spring's county or legislative district caucuses, which
precede the July 15 state convention where delegates will be
allocated. Dukakis, endorsed by Gov. Booth Gardner, led Democrats
with 45 percent, followed by Jackson with 32 percent. The
Democrats' tally won't be completed for a week.

<TEXT>
   The man who found what police believe
to be a valuable stolen painting by French impressionist Claude
Monet stolen says the artwork appears to be damaged.
   ``You could see places where it was rolled up very tightly and
maybe flattened. It had lines running down it from that, and some
of the oil paint was peeled off in places,'' said Charles Polley,
postmaster at LeGrand who found the painting Tuesday morning in a
mail drop-off box.
   Local police, the FBI and the international police agency
Interpol have been searching for the oil painting since it was cut
out of its frame at the Fisher Community Center on March 19, 1987.
   The painting, ``Fishing boats in front of the cliffs at
Etretat,'' was insured for $175,000 by St. Paul Fire and Marine
Insurance Co. The canvas was painted by Monet around 1891.
   The painting was rolled up and bound by two rubber bands when
Polley found it mixed in with other pieces of mail. He said it was
dropped sometime after 3 p.m. Monday and before 7:30 a.m. Tuesday
when he opened the mailbox.
   ``I thought it was trash at first _ but it sure wasn't trash,''
Polley said. ``It had the look of canvas, and I looked at the edges
and knew exactly what it was.''
   When the painting was cut out of its frame, which was rigged to
an alarm system in the police department, the thief didn't make a
clean cut along the bottom of the frame, leaving a jagged tear in
the painting.
   ``I called just about everyone but Interpol,'' said Polley.
``You never know what a day will bring.''
   Lt. Darrell Templeton said at a news conference that he unrolled
part of the left edge of the painting _ the side that shows the
cliffs _ and to him it appears the painting is the original.
   He said the FBI will be contacted, and examiners hired by the
insurance company will have to determine for certain that the
painting is the stolen Monet.
   Templeton said it was a frustrating investigation involving
countless telephone calls and false leads. But he said articles
about the theft probably kept it from being sold on the black
market, ``because it was an odd way of getting it back.''
   Templeton said police have no suspects other than a white male,
about 6-foot-2 or 6-3 and weighing about 250 pounds, who was seen
cutting the painting out of its frame.
   Rex Ryden, in charge of the Fisher Foundation, wasn't sure yet
how the insurance company will react, since the insurance was paid.
   He said the painting will have to be inspected for damage and
whether it can be restored.
   ``It will be a drawn-out procedure,'' Ryden said.

   Guerrillas derailed a passenger train
with a mine and then attacked it, killing at least 11 people and
wounding 29, the national news agency reported today.
   The news agency, AIM, said attack occurred Tuesday after the
train crossed into Mozambique from South Africa. It said many of
the passengers were Mozambican miners returning from jobs in South
Africa.
   Rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance killed 23 people
and wounded 71 in an attack on a train in the same area last Dec.
31, according to Mozambican officials.
   The rebels have been waging a hit-and-run insurgency against the
Marxist government since 1977. Maputo claims the rebels are backed
by South Africa, a charge both the rebels and South Africa deny.

   Ewes imported from Britain, New
Zealand and Australia for breeding are being sheepish about sex,
veterinary officials said.
   Local rams are not interested either, apparently because they
like their mates petite and find the foreigners too big. The coy
ewes may be disoriented by the tropical weather, because they are
used to four seasons.
   Agriculture Minister Sanusi Junid has suggested keeping the
animals in the dark, an idea the Veterinary Services Department is
taking seriously, Director-General Ahmad Mustaffa Babjee said at a
conference today.
   ``The imported sheep should be put in a dark room at a certain
time of the year for some time. When they come out into the light
they may think it is another season and get into the mood to
mate,'' Sanusi said in a speech to the Commonwealth Veterinary
Officers Conference.
   About 20,000 sheep are imported annually for breeding as part of
a government plan to have 1 million head of sheep in Malaysia by
the year 1990.

   A white supremacist accused of plotting
to overthrow the government said he would plead guilty after a
judge refused to suppress a statement the man gave to authorities.
   Bruce Pierce had sought dismissal of the statement he gave to
FBI agents after he was arrested in Georgia in 1985. When U.S.
District Judge Morris Arnold refused, Pierce rose in the courtroom.
   ``I'm going to plead guilty, if that's the court's decision,''
Pierce said Tuesday.
   Arnold told him to discuss the matter with his attorney, Bennett
Nolan, and after a conference with Pierce and other defendants,
Nolan said that Pierce would make a final decision this week on
whether to plead guilty.
   Pierce and nine other white supremacists are charged with
sedition. Five defendants are accused of conspiring to kill a
federal judge and an FBI agent, and two are accused of interstate
transportation of stolen money.
   Pierce is serving sentences totaling 250 years in prison _ 100
years for racketeering and 150 years for violating the civil rights
of outspoken Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg, who was machine
gunned to death in Denver.
   Wayne Manis, an FBI agent, had been scheduled to testify Tuesday
that Pierce confessed several crimes to him while Pierce was in
federal custody in Atlanta.
   Pierce had argued that his statement was not made voluntarily
and should be suppressed. He said agents threatened to have his
wife arrested and put his three children in foster homes if he
refused to make the statement.
   Arnold said he decided the statement was made voluntarily.

<TEXT>
   Silent screen actress Lois Wilson, who
appeared in more than 100 early films including the 1923 Western
epic ``The Covered Wagon,'' has died of pneumonia. She was 93.
   The actress, who sought fame in Hollywood after winning a 1915
statewide beauty contest in Alabama, died at the Riverside Hospital
for Skilled Care here on March 3, a nursing supervisor confirmed
today.
   Miss Wilson was buried Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in
Glendale, Calif., after a memorial service at the Church of the
Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   After her arrival in Hollywood, Miss Wilson landed a small part
in ``The Dumb Girl of Portici,'' which starred legendary ballerina
Anna Pavlova. She went on to act in more than 100 silent and sound
films over the next 33 years.
   Her best-known roles included Molly Wingate in ``The Covered
Wagon'' and Daisy Buchanan in the 1926 version of ``The Great
Gatsby,'' for which she won the Photoplay magazine best performance
award.
   Miss Wilson acted opposite such leading men as Rudolph Valentino
and John Gilbert.
   After retiring from motion pictures in 1941 _ except for a bit
part in the 1949 comedy ``The Girl from Jones Beach,'' starring
Ronald Reagan _ Miss Wilson turned to the Broadway stage, and
eventually television.
   Among the network soap operas in which she played featured
character roles were ``The Guiding Light'' and ``The Edge of
Night.''
   Although she never married, Miss Wilson, a 5-foot-5 brunette,
was once described as cultivating a screen image of the ``soft,
marrying kind of woman.''
   Selected in 1924 by Paramount to represent the motion-picture
industry at the British Empire Exposition, Miss Wilson was termed
``a typical example of the American girl in character, culture and
beauty.''
   On leaving television, Miss Wilson returned to the Los Angeles
suburb of North Hollywood, where she shared a home with a sister.
She later moved near a niece in Reno.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, who vaulted
into the front rank of the Democratic pack with a strong Super
Tuesday showing, said today that ``people were responding to my
message,'' not his Southern background.
   ``We won in the West also, and sooner or later it's going to
stop being a surprise,'' Gore said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.''
   ``I am not a Southern candidate,'' Gore said Tuesday night in
Nashville, Tenn. ``I'm a national candidate who's a Southern and
proud of it.''
   ``I'm excited about this victory. I thought it would happen
exactly this way ... people were responding to my message,'' Gore
said today.
   ``I think it essentially is a three-person race,'' Gore said.
``Democrats are looking at who can best carry our party's standard
into the fall election.
   He was leaving today for Chicago before heading for South
Carolina, where he hoped to pick up delegates at that state's
Democratic caucuses on Saturday.
   Gore established himself as a solid contender by winning five
states in his native South: Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, North
Carolina and Oklahoma.
   Even as the votes were being counted in Tuesday's races, Gore
was looking ahead to the next round of contests, in the industrial
states of the North.
   After spending much of the Super Tuesday campaign sparring with
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Gore began the next round by
pointing to Dukakis as his chief rival.
   Gephardt was one of the big losers of Super Tuesday, winning
only his home state.
   ``This is becoming a two-person race between Michael Dukakis and
Al Gore,'' Gore said. ``It's a race between the politics of the
past and the politics of the future.''
   Dukakis also ran well in Tuesday's contests, as did Jesse
Jackson.
   Gore advisers began making the pitch that Dukakis has an
``electability'' problem _ that he is too Northern, too liberal and
too ethnic to carry the region against the Republcans.
   ``I think Mike Dukakis is going to represent for many voters the
same old formula that led to the loss of 49 out of 50 states twice
in the last five elections,'' Gore said.
   ``We did particularly well with independents and
independently-thinking Democrats and some disillusioned
Republicans,'' he said. ``And that's where the battle ground is
going to be in the general election.''

   Blair Brown and Dennis Franz, better
known as their TV personas Molly Dodd and Norm Buntz, will rejoin
NBC's lineup this month, a network spokesman says.
   The return of ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'' and
``Beverly Hills Buntz'' were unrelated to a strike called by the
Writers Guild of America, NBC media representative Brian Robinette
said Tuesday. ``This is phase two of late-season schedule changes
that we announced over 10 days ago,'' he said.
   ``Molly Dodd,'' a soft-pedaled show featuring Brown as an
over-30 working woman struggling to make a living in Manhattan,

<HEAD>Proposal Backed to Make English Official Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents argued that making English the official
language of Texas was a divisive measure, but state Republicans
spoke with almost one voice in backing the proposal.
   More than nine in 10 GOP voters in Texas' Super Tuesday
elections endorsed a non-binding referendum to make English the
official language of Texas and the United States.
   ``We were hoping for approval between 75 and 80 percent, so the
higher the percentage goes above that the happier we are with the
results,'' said Lou Zaeske, chairman of the Bryan-based American
Ethnic Coalition.
   Zaeske, whose group helped place the proposal on the GOP ballot,
said proponents were not trying to keep people from learning and
speaking foreign languages.
   ``We just think we should have a common language _ like we have
a common currency.''
   Fred Meyer, Texas Republican Party finance chairman, said the
idea behind the proposals is to help all Americans succeed at jobs
and elsewhere in society.
   But Texas Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle criticized the
measure, saying it would be more ``politically courageous'' to do
what is right than to capitalize on what polls show to be a popular
notion.
   ``I think it is terribly divisive, and I think it causes Mexican
Americans who already know they must speak English in order to
advance in this society to feel they are being picked on,'' Slagle
said.
   The official-language issue was only on the Republican ballot in
Texas.
   In a June survey, 70 percent of the Texas Democrats surveyed
said they favored the idea of establishing English as the official
language of the state, and 75.4 percent of independents approved of
the proposal.
   On Tuesday, about 93 percent of those voting in the Texas
Republican primary favored the statement, ``English should be
established as the official language of the state of Texas and the
United States of America.''
   Meanwhile in Florida, organizers of a drive to make English that
state's official language said they collected 260,000 signatures on
Super Tuesday. The group needs 342,939 signatures to get the issue
on the November ballot as a referendum.
   The issue is emotional in heaily Hispanic Dade County, around
Miami, where some fear the drive could increase ethnic tensions.

   Share prices were firmer in London at midday
today, boosted by previous rises in New York and Tokyo.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 6.3
points at 1,821.3 at 12:47, below the day's peak of 1,826.0, up 11
points, at around 10 a.m.
   The index opened 8.2 points higher at 1,823.2 points following
gains in New York on Tuesday, where the Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose 24.70 to 2,081.07, and a rise in Tokyo earlier today,
where the Nikkei Dow index climbed 139.66 to 25,605.39.
   Dealers said prices eased in later trading because the London
price rise was not supported by sufficient buying interest.
   Among the stocks marked up was Hillsdown Holdings, which rose
7.3 cents to $5.57 after announcing that its pre-tax profits last
year doubled to $202.3 million from $100.7 million in 1986.
   Among the banks, Barclays was off 1.8 cents at $9.32, and TSB

   Bob Wieland, the legless Vietnam veteran who
co-stars in the NBC-TV series ``Sonny Spoon,'' started the Los
Angeles Marathon a day early and ended it two days late, exhausted
but proud.
   Wieland, 41, covered the 26.2-mile course in about 74{ hours
without using a wheelchair. He bettered his 1987 marathon time by
an impressive 18 hours, using his powerful arms to push himself
along on his padded hands.
   He crossed the finish line Tuesday morning to cheers from about
100 well-wishers and reporters. ``Outside of Vietnam, this has been
the most intense 72 hours I ever spent in my entire life,'' he said
as he neared the finish.
   Wieland was the first to start the LA Marathon on Saturday, a
day earlier than most of the 17,040 runners, and was the last to
finish.

<TEXT>
   Former Chancellor Kurt Georg
Kiesinger, who overcame the taint of a Nazi past to head West
Germany for three years in the 1960s, died today at age 83.
   Kiesinger had been a member of the Nazi party from 1933 to 1945
and worked in the foreign ministry's radio propaganda section
during World War II. He was never charged with war crimes or
atrocities.
   The Christian Democratic politician died in the Tuebingen
University hospital of heart failure, his office in Bonn said in a
statement released to the news media.
   In 1966, Kiesinger succeeded fellow Christian Democrat
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, whose mini-coalition with the small Free
Democrats had broken up.
   Kiesinger, serving as West Germany's third chancellor, was a
symbol of reconciliation to many Germans. He grouped the
conservative Christian Democrats and their Bavarian counterparts
with the leftist-leaning Social Democrats to forge what was called
the ``Grand Coalition.''
   It was the first German government in a generation to include
the Social Democrats, whose Willy Brandt served as the coalition's
foreign minister before taking over as chancellor in 1969.
   Kiesinger, a Roman Catholic, was born April 6, 1904 in Ebingen,
Baden-Wuerttemburg. Tall and silver-haired, he spoke with a vibrant
voice tinged with the dialect of his native Swabia.
   As a 29-year-old lawyer, Kiesinger joined the Nazi party in
1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power. He said he became
disillusioned with the party a year later because of the bloody
purge of storm trooper leader Ernst Roehm and his associates.
   During World War II, Kiesinger worked in the radio propaganda
section of the Nazi foreign ministry, acting as department head for
some of his term there.
   After the war, he spent 16 months in an American internment
camp. A German court fined him 50 marks, then $12.50, for being a
party member. The fine was remitted when the court ruled later that
he had risked his life to get a student out of a Nazi prison.
   Kiesinger's Nazi past brought him much unfavorable publicity
when he became a candidate for chancellor, and the issue cropped up
again during his term. He always denied any wrongdoing and declared:
   ``I have clean hands. I know what I did and what I did not do.''
   He forged stronger ties with the communist states of eastern
Europe, breaking with past policy. He opened diplomatic relations
with Romania and Yugoslavia, but his overtures suffered a setback
when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   His government remained a resolute ally of the United States,
but he feuded with President Johnson in 1967, when he complained
that he had not been adequately consulted on a U.S.-Soviet nuclear
weapons treaty.
   He also let Johnson know that Bonn no longer could afford to buy
enough U.S. arms to offset the cost of stationing U.S. troops in
Germany. As a result, the United States withdrew 35,000 troops in
1967.
   His administration had inherited a recession, but the coalition
suceeded in revitalizing the economy. Toward the end of his
Kiesinger's tenure, however, the booming economy wrought high
inflation that was a key to cracking the coalition he helped forge.

   Attackers hurling hand
grenades and firing automatic rifles assaulted a police station in
Soweto and injured nine black officers, police headquarters said
today.
   The assailants fled in a vehicle after policemen returned fire
with shotguns, according to police. No arrested were reported.
   The attack occurred Tuesday night as municipal policemen were
changing shifts at the Mapetla police station in Soweto,
Johannesburg's main black township.
   Police said the attackers threw three hand grenades at the
officers and fired Soviet-made AK-47 rifles. Only one of the
wounded officers was seriously hurt, police said.
   Black policemen have been frequent targets of attacks by
anti-apartheid militants who view them as government collaborators.
   Authorities have blamed many previous attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement.

<TEXT>
   Union writers refused to continue working on
next month's Academy Awards ceremony script and CBS-TV shelved two
new shows as a strike by the Writers Guild of America put a crunch
on Hollywood.
   The Academy Awards ceremony, scheduled for worldwide broadcast
by ABC-TV on April 11, will air without the aid of the striking
WGA, spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said Tuesday night.
   The union's western unit board voted unanimously Tuesday night
to reject a request for a waiver from the producers of the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences show. A waiver would have
allowed union work despite the strike.
   Ms. Rhoden said the guild's eastern unit didn't vote because the
show is produced in Los Angeles and would only involve members of
the western unit.
   Scriptwriter Mel Shavelson, former WGA president, and Jack Rose
were hired by the academy to write the program.
   ``If there is no waiver, I won't do the show,'' Shavelson said
before the vote. He added that the writing is far from complete.
``Most of the work is done when the cast shows up at rehearsal.
It's rewriting, really.''
   CBS-TV announced Tuesday that two new shows scheduled to debut
later this month have been shelved indefinitely.
   ``The Dictator,'' a comedy starring Christopher Lloyd, was in
its third week of production in New York but didn't have enough
scripts completed to warrant going ahead with next week's premiere,
the network said.
   No scripts had been completed for the other show, ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour,'' which was to debut March 23.
   CBS said ``My Sister Sam,'' which had been removed from the
network's schedule earlier this year, would return in place of
``The Dictator.'' The network said it would fill ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour'' slot with special programming.
   On Tuesday, Leonard Farrell of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service brought together negotiators for the
scriptwriters and producers to review differences.
   Both sides outlined differences and issues, but no bargaining
was conducted, said Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers. Sticking points were
writers' demands for increased fees and creative rights.
   In the early evening, the meeting was recessed until 11 a.m.
Thursday.
   ``This strike is going to be over someday,'' Farrell told
reporters. ``And it might just as well be over now. That's what we
usually tell (the opposing sides).''
   The strike began Monday with a massive picket line in front of
20th Century Fox studios. It followed the writers' rejection Sunday
of the producers' final contract offer.
   Talk shows and soap operas would be the first to feel the
effects of the strike, probably turning to reruns, the union said.
Producers said other shows had stockpiled scripts.
   The WGA strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973.
The longest, in 1981, lasted three months.

   A government attorney contends that although
the United States committed ``great wrongs'' to the thousands of
Japanese-Americans detained in prison camps during World War II,
the victims shouldn't be allowed to sue now for damages.
   ``The statute of limitations clearly began to run in the
1940s,'' Justice Department attorney Jay Bybee told the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit during arguments
Tuesday on a $24 billion lawsuit filed in 1983 on behalf of 120,000
Japanese-Americans.
   Bybee told the three-judge panel of Giles Rich, Phillip Baldwin
and Helen Nies, ``There is no dispute that there were great wrongs
done to Japanese-Americans.... But even when mistakes are made,
people must file timely claims for redress.''
   Bybee contended that the six-year statute of limitations on
suits against the government expired decades ago.
   But plaintiffs' attorney Benjamin Zelenko argued that the
statute of limitations did not come into play until the early 1980s
because of ``deliberate concealment and misrepresentation by the
government of critical information regarding its claim of `military
necessity''' for the internment.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the internment of
Japanese-Americans and Japanese citizens living in California and
parts of Oregon, Washington and Arizona in the wake of the 1941
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, when he was advised by military
leaders that people of Japanese descent could not be trusted.
   The only time the Supreme Court has ruled on the internment
itself was in 1944, when it found the action was a constitutionally
acceptable military necessity. Government documents discovered
later indicate no such military necessity existed.
   The concealment didn't end, Zelenko argued, until the 1980s,
when a congressionally appointed commission found that there was no
military necessity for the internment. The policy was ``driven by
race prejudice, war hysteria and lack of political leadership,'' he
said.
   This is the second time a federal appeals court has heard the
case. In 1986, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia ruled that the government must defend itself at trial
against the suit. That ruling overturned a 1984 decision by
District Court Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer, who had ruled that the
statute of limitations had expired.
   But last June, the Supreme Court ruled that the statute of
limitations issue should have been decided by a different court _
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
   The lead plaintiff in the case is William Hohri, a computer
programmer living in Chicago. Hohri, a San Francisco native who
lived in Southern California when the war began, said Tuesday he
was interned at Manzanar camp east of the Sierra Nevada shortly
after his 15th birthday. He left for the Midwest 2{ years later and
never returned to California.

<HEAD>FBI Halts Attempted Helicopter Escape From Federal Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate at the Federal Correctional
Institute who arranged a helicopter escape with an undercover FBI
agent was seized just as he was trying to make his getaway,
officials said.
   Prison officers grabbed William M. Carroll, 28, on Tuesday after
he used a red apron he was wearing to signal a helicopter pilot
hovering over the facility, said Ray Hooker, executive assistant to
Warden John Gluch.
   ``But it didn't land, and the guy tried to blend into the prison
population,'' said Kenneth Walton, head of the FBI's Michigan
office.
   ``He thought he had it made, and then the guards started coming
out of the woodwork. They arrested him and now he's in
segregation.''
   Carroll, a Georgia native, was serving a 15-year sentence on a
1986 conviction for aiding and abetting in the counterfeiting of
$20 bills, Hooker said. He had been scheduled for parole in October
1992.
   Carroll allegedly offered $1.25 million in counterfeit money for
the escape, and $1 million if the pilot would kill a federal
witness, Walton said.
   Authorities at the prison 45 miles southwest of Detroit learned
of the escape plan through an internal investigation, Hooker said.
They referred the matter to the FBI, which planted an undercover
agent who acted as Carroll's contact and also supplied the
helicopter and pilot, Hooker said.

   A mathematical puzzle that has
fascinated scientists and researchers for hundreds of years may now
be solved, a professor at West Germany's Max-Planck Institute said
today.
   The puzzle has been how to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,
developed by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who lived from
1601 to 1665.
   The theorem states: X to the Nth power, plus Y to the Nth power,
equals Z to the Nth power, where X, Y, and Z are nonzero integers,
has no solutions for N when N is an integer _ or whole number _
greater than the number two.
   Fermat, who was also a magistrate, developed his expertise in
mathematics as a hobby, and was one of the founders of modern
Number Theory and Probability.
   ``Many important developments in number theory have resulted
from unsuccessful attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,''
Professor Don Zagier said in a telephone interview.
   Now, Japanese mathematician Yoichi Miyaoka, who also works at
the Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, may have finally
proven Fermat's Last Theorem, Zagier said.
   ``This whole thing is of course in the preliminary stages, but
Miyaoka, who gave a presentation on his solution 10 days ago,
believes he has proven the theory and it is certainly serious and
very exciting,'' Zagier said.
   Zagier, an American working as a researcher at the Max-Planck
Institute, is also a professor at the University of Maryland.
   He said he jotted down notes at Miyaoka's presentation and sent
them to several experts, including Gerd Faltings at Princeton and
mathemeticians Barry Mazur and Christophe Soule' in Paris.
   ``Of course the notes alone are not sufficient, and Miyaoka has
been preparing and checking his manuscript on the solution for the
past week, and that will also be sent to the experts to check,''
said Zagier.
   Zagier said he hoped some results from the experts would be
forthcoming ``within 10 days, but it could also take several
months.''
   Asked if Miyaoka was available to discuss his solution of
proving Fermat's Last Theorem, Zagier said the Japanese was ``too
busy rechecking his work, because there is always a chance of an
error, and he wants to be sure the manuscript is accurate before it
goes out.''
   ``I've been more or less answering the telephone for him since
word of this leaked out,'' Zagier said.

   Eight communist rebels, including a
former regional commander, were captured and two were killed in
separate raids and clashes across the country, the military said
today.
   Also today, opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense
minister, claimed the 19-year communist insurgency was
strengthening because the nation's 160,000-member armed forces was
increasingly disorganized and poorly supplied.
   The military said troops killed the leader of the rebel
propaganda unit in Nueva Ecjia province in a clash Tuesday north of
Manila. Government forces, which suffered no casualties, also
captured four rebels, the report said.
   Brig. Gen. Domingo Rio said Nemesio Demafiles, former commander
of the communist New People's Army on Negros island, was captured
Tuesday afternoon in a private home near the local headquarters of
the Philippine Constabulary in Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila.
   Three others were arrested in the same raid, the military said,
adding that it came a day after Demafiles' bodyguard was arrested
near Bacolod.
   In a separate incident Tuesday, troops killed a rebel officer
near the Mindanao city of Butuan, the military said.
   Military and rebel sources said Demafiles was replaced last year
as the Negros commander of the New People's Army, the armed wing of
the Communist Party of the Philippines.
   In a report to constabulary headquarters in Manila, Rio said
police found a .45-caliber pistol and a map of the constabulary
office in Bacolod during the raid in which Demafiles was arrested.
The report said Demafiles was apparently planning an attack on the
paramilitary police Bacolod headquarters.
   Negros has been a stronghold of the New People's Army.
   In Manila, Enrile told the American Chamber of Commerce that
disorganization in the armed forces and a lack of supplies are
hampering the anti-insurgency drive.
   He said the New People's Army had grown in size to between
25,000 and 30,000 fighters and that they controlled more territory
than at any time during the rebellion.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, proclaiming himself ``halfway to
winning'' the Democratic presidential nomination, said today he was
looking forward to the prospect of facing George Bush in the fall
election.
   But Dukakis, who won in the big Super Tuesday states of Texas
and Florida and generally split the day's spoils with Jesse Jackson
and Albert Gore, said he's not assuming the Democratic contest is
over.
   ``I said when this started this is a marathon and we're going to
have to take it contest by contest,'' Dukakis said on CBS-TV.
   Interviewed on NBC-TV, he said, ``I'd say I'm about halfway to
winning the nomination.''
   He said he expects to gain enough delegates in the final round
of primaries, in California and New Jersey, to secure the
nomination before the Democratic convention.
   Looking past that, he said that ``it looks like the Republican
nominee is going to be George Bush. I'm looking forward to that.''
   Dukakis, here to campaign for next week's Illinois primary,
said, ``It's really a great day'' following his showing Tuesday.
   ``To be a son of Massachusetts and to go into Florida and Texas
and beat some candidates who obviously have some very strong ties
with the South is just a terrific thing, as well as to do well in
Maryland ... and out in the Pacific Northwest.''
   Asked whether he intended to use negative ads similar to those
he has aimed at rival Richard Gebhardt, Dukakis said, ``If people
insist on using this negative stuff, then I've learned,
unfortunately from painful experience, that you have to respond.''
   Kicking off his Illinois primary campaign, Dukakis was playing
up his Greek immigrant heritage. The Chicago area is among the most
ethnically diverse in the nation, with its heavy population of
first- and second-generation Eastern Europeans.
   ``Many of your families, like my parents, came to this land in
search of opportunity,'' Dukakis told cheering supporters on
Tuesday. ``They didn't have much money in their pockets; they
couldn't speak the language, but they believed in the American
dream. ... It was their broad shoulders and strong arms and keen
minds that built the mightiest industrial machine in the world.''
   Despite the cash drain of Super Tuesday with its emphasis on
television advertising, the Dukakis campaign remains financially
well off.
   Campaign finance chief Robert Farmer said Dukakis was raising
half a million dollars a week. Coming out of Super Tuesday, he
said, Dukakis had $2 million in the bank and another $1 million on
the way in federal matching funds.

   An undergraduate's bill at Yale
University will rise 6.1 percent to $18,060 for the 1988-89 school
year, the prestigious private university said.
   The percentage rise was the same as last year's, said Yale
President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. said Tuesday. It cost $17,020 to
attend Yale this school year.
   The increase was approved over the weekend by the Yale
Corporation, the school's board of trustees. Tuition will increase
6.9 percent to $12,960, an increase of 6.9 percent, and room and
board will go up to $5,100, an increase of 4 percent.
   Announced increases at other Ivy League schools range from 6.2
percent at Princeton to 6.7 percent at Cornell, said Yale spokesman
Walter Littell. The cost of attending most Ivy League schools will
be in the range of $17,000 to $18,300, according to figures
supplied by Littell.

<HEAD>Fraudulent `Police' Charity Ring Broken with Arrest of 11 People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bogus fund-raising ring that claimed to aid
the families of police officers killed in the line of duty instead
pocketed millions of dollars from donors, authorities have charged.
   Three former police detectives for the Brooklyn district
attorney's office were among 11 people arrested following raids
Monday at 15 sites in New York City and on Long Island, Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
   The ring raised $600,000 a year since setting up the fraudulent
charity 10 years ago, Morgenthau said Tuesday. The ring operated
under two names: the Police Conference of New York Inc. and the New
York State District Attorney Police Benevolent Association.
   The groups are not registered with the state as charities. The
authorities said the groups kept all but about $4,000 a year, which
was spent on insurance they sold to police officers on Long Island.
   The operation was run by Joseph Tarantola, 48, of Tannersville,
Pa., who was a detective in the Brooklyn district attorney's office
until he was fired in 1976 because of questionable fund-raising
activities, Morgenthau said.
   Also arrested were two of his associates who held the same post:
Neil Lombardo, 44, of Brooklyn, a detective from 1970 to 1983; and
Clark Simmons, 66, of Brooklyn, a detective from 1969 to 1977.
   The district attorney said Tarantola's group, in business for
several years, used solicitors operating out of ``boiler rooms'' to
call and pressure potential contributors, most of them businessmen.
   The solicitors would call and claim connections to legitimate
police groups. They would refer to news accounts of officers
wounded or killed on duty and appeal to the donor's sympathy or
sense of civic duty to get money.
   If the solicitor got a donation, he would send the giver a
souvenir imprinted with an official-looking badge and slogan.
Souvenirs included decals, baseball caps, lapel pins shaped like
badges and large metal shields designed to be affixed to a car
bumper. A donor's gift determined which souvenir he got.
   ``They would tell the contributor that having this decal on your
window is like having the chief in your backseat,'' the district
attorney said.
   The solicitor received a percentage of donations, Morgenthau
said.
   The investigation into the ring began in July 1985 after people
complained they were being harassed, Morgenthau said.
   Authorities raided 15 suspected boiler room sites Monday in
Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, and on Long Island in
Hempstead and Massapequa.
   Tarantola and nine others arrested were charged with
first-degree scheming to defraud, punishable by up to four years in
prison. An 11th person was arrested on a weapons possession charge
for allegedly having an unlicensed pistol.

   Richard Gephardt headed for campaign stops in
South Carolina today after a Super Tuesday disaster he blamed on
lack of money and a withering crossfire from rivals Michael Dukakis
and Albert Gore Jr.
   ``With 20 states and a million dollars, we just could not get
our message ... in front of the voters,'' Gephardt said in an
interview broadcast today on ABC-TV.
   ``I really think I'm the only one who has talked about the
issues people really care about,'' Gephardt said. ``I just couldn't
get it across in enough Southern states.''
   Gephardt said he's not finished ``if I can get back into the
race in the states coming up.'' To make the point, he was flying to
South Carolina today, campaigning for that state's caucuses on
Saturday.
   Tuesday night, Gephardt told supporters, ``I never told you it
was going to be easy.''
   ``This wasn't the best of days,'' Gephardt told a subdued group
of backers after winning only on his home turf of Missouri and
finishing a dismal third or fourth in most of the 19 other states
up for grabs Tuesday.
   Gephardt's loss was Gore's gain, as the Tennessee senator
decisively won their battle for the mantle of moderate alternative
to Dukakis and Jesse Jackson. Gephardt acknowledged that he was
unable to counter a spate of negative ads aimed at him by both Gore
and Dukakis.
   ``We had a situation where we had about $6 million or $7 million
spent against us by those two candidates, against about $1 million
we were able to spend,'' he said as the voters' verdict became
apparent.
   Later, addressing supporters at his St. Louis headquarters, he
spoke bravely of future victories rather than analyzing his Super
Tuesday losses.
   He insisted there are still ``great days ahead'' for his
campaign, which had jumped out of the starting gates with a win in
the Iowa caucuses but began slipping in successive contests.
   Aides, however, conceded that Gephardt's fourth-place overall
showing would put a pinch on fund raising just when the campaign
needs money the most.
   ``We're not penniless,'' said campaign consultant Bob Shrum.
``It won't be as easy to raise money, but we'll raise money. It's
not a good thing to have happen to you.''
   They pointed to Michigan's caucuses later this month as the next
``clean shot'' of the campaign, downplaying the impact of next
week's Illinois primary.
   But as his spoke of targeting resources in selected tests,
Gephardt told his backers in the city he represents in Congress
that he will campaign everywhere and stay in the race until the
Democratic convention this summer.
   ``We're going to carry our cause to every one of those days in
every one of those states,'' Gephardt said. ``We didn't shrink when
we were behind in Iowa and we're not going to shrink now.''
   Gephardt said he simply didn't have the money to respond to the
advertising blitz by Dukakis and Gore.
   ``Our message got across in Iowa, got across in New Hampshire,
got across in South Dakota,'' Gephardt said. ``But in 14 short days
we were not able to get it across in the 20 states of the South the
way we wanted.''
   Deputy campaign manager Joe Trippi said Gephardt's financial
shape isn't all that bad, because he has debts of only $75,000 and
has $250,000 on hand. In addition, Trippi said, the campaign
anticipates raising $500,000 within two weeks despite the
anticipated financial pinch stemming from Tuesday's showing.
   Gephardt aides spent most of the day Tuesday saying the campaign
will focus on the March 26 Michigan voting, in effect conceding the
large Illinois showdown to home-state favorites Sen. Paul Simon and
Jesse Jackson.
   ``Our intention is to compete in South Carolina, campaign in
Illinois but really focus on Michigan,'' Trippi said.
   To underscore that point, Gephardt made South Carolina his first
post-Super Tuesday appearance.
   He then was heading for Michigan before traveling to Illinois
for two days of stumping. Gephardt is scheduled to take a couple of
days off the campaign trail next weekend, just two days before the
big Illinois primary, and Trippi said that was to allow the
candidate to prepare for Michigan.
   ``This is a long campaign,'' Gephardt said. ``Those who prevail
are those who don't lose their heart.''

<HEAD>Militant Leader Takes Over Top Sikh Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical priest Jasbir Singh Rode was
installed as the leader of 25 million Sikhs today and vowed to win
the fight to create a homeland for his people.
   Rode was named by a Sikh committee as chief priest of the Akal
Takht, or the eternal throne within the Golden Temple, the holiest
Sikh shrine and the seat of Sikhism's spiritual authority.
   The post, although religious, wields great political influence.
   Rode was released from jail Saturday in what apparently was a
move by the federal government to involve militant Sikhs in finding
a solution to the violence in Punjab state.
   Militant Sikhs have been waging a five-year war for a separate
homeland in Punjab, claiming that they are discriminated against by
the predominant Hindu community. Sikhs form 2 percent of India's
800 million people but are in a majority in Punjab state.
   Rode said at his installation ceremony that he had not reached
an understanding with the government prior to his release from
jail. He had been held since 1985 for alleged sedition, but he
never was brought to trial.
   ``We will try to reach a solution with the government which will
not amount to a surrender,'' Rode said. ``But we will struggle till
we get our rights.''
   He called for unity among political factions in the Sikh
community. During the ceremony, young men armed with Soviet-made
AK-47 rifles stood guard.
   More than 400 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
attacks blamed on Sikhs. Most of the victims have been Hindus or
moderate Sikhs. More than 1,000 people died last year in attacks
blamed on the extremists.

   Northerner Michael Dukakis declared today he had a ``national
victory'' with wins in Texas, Florida, Maryland and the West but
Southerners Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. celebrated their own
strong Super Tuesday showings in the Democratic primaries.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Iowa winner, took only his home state
of Missouri and faced a fight to keep his campaign from fading into
oblivion.
   ``This was a good national victory and I feel terrific this
morning,'' Dukakis said on ABC-TV. ``I think that demonstrates who
can win in November.'' The Massachusetts governor won the day's
three biggest prizes: Florida, Texas and his home state. He also
won in Rhode Island, Maryland, Idaho and Hawaii.
   Dukakis scored well among elements of ``the new South,''
collecting heavy support from Jewish voters in Florida, Hispanics
in Texas and Catholics across the region, according to ABC News
surveys of voters as they left the polls.
   The Democrat with the best-financed and probably best-organized
campaign, Dukakis emerged in a strong position for the next round
of primaries in Midwestern and Northern industrial states.
   Poised to challenge him were Tennessean Gore and South Carolina
native Jackson, who divided the day's spoils with the front-runner.
Dukakis picked up 386 new delegates toward the party's July
nominating convention, Jackson collected 366 and Gore 326.
   Gore, who was seen as fighting Gephardt for the more
conservative Southern Democratic vote, suggested that rivalry was
now behind him. ``It's a three-man race, no question about it,'' he
said on NBC-TV.
   He immediately took aim at Dukakis, calling him a representative
of ``the politics of the past'' who lacks the appeal to moderate
voters that Democrats need to win back the White House in November.
   Jackson declined to attack his Democratic rivals. ``I'm
concerned we run a campaign that will serve my party well,'' he
said, contending intra-party bickering had cost Democrats the White
House in the past.
   Gore racked up victories in Kentucky, Oklahoma, North Carolina
and Arkansas, as well as his home state of Tennessee, while Jackson
won in Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama.
   The day's big loser among Democrats was Gephardt, who won only
in his home state of Missouri and added just 93 delegates to his
total.
   Gephardt's money-starved campaign was unable to afford the
expensive media buys necessary to blanket the 20 states which had
Democratic contests on Tuesday. He said he was outspent
seven-to-one by Gore and Dukakis and couldn't get his message
across.
   ``It certainly wasn't the best of days,'' Gephardt said in St.
Louis. He vowed to press on, despite comments like those from the
party's senior statesman Robert Strauss, who said the contest had
narrowed to Dukakis, Jackson and Gore.
   ``I expect one of those three fellows will probably be the
nominee,'' Strauss said.
   Jackson demonstrated that he had expanded his political base
somewhat beyond what he established in his 1984 candidacy, doubling
the proportion of white Southern votes he won to 10 percent. He got
virtually all of the black vote. In Virginia, he piled up a
surprising 2-1 margin over Gore, his nearest competitor.
   Jackson, who has campaigned hard on themes like economic justice
and combating the drug crisis, told supporters: ``Our message is
winning. We have the poorest campaign, the richest message.''
   Gore, who sat out most of the early primary and caucus battles
to concentrate his resources on his home turf, made the strong
showing he needed. It remained to be seen, however, whether he
could maintain that strength beyond the South.
   The day had been designed by Southern Democrats from the start
to bring to the forefront a candidate like Gore, whose strong views
on defense and foreign policy have appeal in the South.
   One of those behind the ``Super Tuesday'' southern strategy,
former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, called the day a success. ``I
think the emergence of Al Gore is the most important development on
the Democratic side,'' said Robb.
   ``The message today is that we're still a part of the mainstream
of the nation,'' said Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. ``Super Tuesday
probably won't decide anything, but it will take everybody one step
further along the way. Our job is to let the folks in Illinois,
Pennsylvania (which have upcoming primaries) ... sort this all out
for us, and give us a nominee we can get behind.''

   Bill Britt, who gained fame as the ``hermit of
Chestnut Hill'' before dying alone in the woods, will be cremated
and his ashes scattered next to his favorite tree, his daughter
said.
   ``I think my father would have wanted to return to the
elements,'' Ingrid Boughner said Tuesday. ``I know he would want to
be returned to his favorite tree. I can almost hear him saying
`yes.'''
   Britt, who resisted efforts to move him to a shelter, should
have been more carefully monitored although he was unlike most
homeless people, say city officials who knew him.
   Britt, 52, died of hypothermia two weeks before his body was
discovered Monday by Ms. Boughner and her brother in a makeshift
wigwam in Brookline, the Suffolk County medical examiner's office
said Tuesday.
   ``Homeless people, people like Britt who say they want to be
alone, should be protected in this weather,'' said Dr. Stanton
Kessler, a senior pathologist in the medical examiner's office.
``He had no food in him. He had no sleeping bag. This type of thing
should be prevented.''
   Ms. Boughner said she decided on cremation after talking to her
father's longtime friend William Baird, the birth control activist,
who told her the two had once discussed cremation.
   Officials of the Metropolitan District Commission, on whose land
Britt lived, said they did not object to Ms. Boughner's decision.
   Britt died in the woods in the Chestnut Hill reservoir, near the
affluent community of the same name where he was born and grew up.
He had lived in the woods since 1969 and did not attract much
attention until 1985, when officials began trying to move him out
of the woods and into public or subsidized housing.
   Britt's continual resistance to efforts to help him gained media
attention and led to his nickname ``the hermit of Chestnut Hill.''
At one point, actor Mickey Rooney said he planned to buy the rights
to his story. In May, Britt appeared on ``Late Night with David
Letterman.''
   Boston Chief Housing Court Justice E. George Daher, who tried to
arrange housing and medical aid for Britt despite his lack of
cooperation, said Tuesday he was shocked and saddened by the news
of Britt's death.
   ``He represents in a microcosm what happens to the homeless, the
unfortunates, the eccentrics in this cold society,'' said Daher.
``Someone should have checked in on him, rather than have him die a
lonely tragic death like this.''
   A one-time insurance agent who also worked in Procter & Gamble's
marketing division in New York City 30 years ago, Britt once had
been married with a family.
   Both public officials and friends said he was a paradox; a loner
who loved to chat with Boston College students who went to class
just yards from his shelter; an eccentric who said he wanted to be
left alone but who regularly pitched stories about himself to the
media.
   Mary Callahan, 27, was one of the first to write about Britt as
a reporter on a weekly newspaper.
   ``It seems so sad to me,'' said Callahan, who now works for
Boston College. ``He was a singular person, a very interesting man.
He looked very old but he was so articulate. He talked about
writing poetry, about writing books. It's strange that he decided
to live there.''

   ``Apparently they went into the clouds, and one came out and one

   The wreckage was found on Pine Grove Mountain, about five miles
east of Pine Grove Mills in Centre County, said CAP Lt. Col Paul
Rost, who coordinated the air search from Allegheny County Airport
near Pittsburgh.
   Byrne, reached at the Tico Air Show at Space Center Executive

   Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
trying to revive his campaign after Super Tuesday's losses, told
Chicago voters today it is ``up to Illinois now to turn it around.''
   Dole visited a commuter train station in the village of
Hinsdale, a western Chicago suburb, to shake hands with a few
people as they hurried off to work. Supporters displayed a large
banner reading, ``Vote for Dole delegates or alternatives.''
   Across the street, Dole gulped down a pastry and coffee at a
restaurant counter as television cameras recorded the scene.
   ``Are you hanging in there?'' a gray-haired woman asked Dole.
   ``It will be up to Illinois now to turn it around,'' Dole
replied.
   Dole left the Super Tuesday states behind long before the polls
closed and arrived in Illinois Tuesday, saying he was ``on the road
to recovery.''
   ``This is going to be Bob Dole's recovery state,'' the Kansas
senator told a crowd of cheering supporters Tuesday night in
Chicago.
   ``It's going to be the turnaround state. It's going to get us
back on the winning track.''
   After Dole's losses in Tuesday's primaries and caucuses, the
March 15 Illinois primary is a make-or-break event for the
senator's candidacy, his aides concede.
   ``We've got to make it happen in Illinois,'' said Thomas D.
Rath, a senior strategist in the campaign.
   Although polls indicate that Vice President George Bush leads
Dole in Illinois, Rath said, the campaign hopes to surge ahead by
focusing on what has become a dominant theme _ Dole's leadership in
the Senate and contrasting that to Bush's record.
   ``If you're looking for somebody who understands the issues,
somebody who deals with the issues every day and somebody who has
made a difference, you can pretty well judge a candidate by what
they've done in the past,'' Dole told supporters in Oak Brook, a
Chicago suburb where he watched the Super Tuesday results on
television.
   The Dole campaign is counting on strong support in downstate
farming areas and in Republican counties near the Illinois-Missouri
border. In addition, the campaign is targeting white-collar
suburban areas around Chicago.
   William Brock, Dole's campaign chairman, acknowledged that
Tuesday's losses dealt a serious blow to the Dole campaign.
   ``The psychological hit is very heavy,'' said Brock.
   Brock attributed Bush's victories to President Reagan's
popularity in the South, and expressed frustration that the Dole
campaign had not been able to make gains by attacking Bush and
focusing the campaign on issues such as the deficit and drug use in
America.
   ``You do the best you can. We did not have time to develop the
one-on-one message that we did in the earlier states,'' Brock said.
``Now we've got a little more time. We'll see if we can do a better
job.''
   On arriving in Illinois on Tuesday, Dole immediately took aim at
Bush when he spoke at a rally at the state Capitol in Springfield,
challenging the vice president to a series of debates.
   Later Tuesday, when it became clear he had suffered a big
defeat, Dole rallied his supporters by recalling that he had come
to Chicago 40 years ago for treatment by a surgeon for crippling
wounds suffered in World War II.
   ``I've been coming to Illinois for a long, long time,'' Dole
said. ``I don't give up very easily. We're going to be on the road
to recovery in the state of Illinois.''

   The number of farmers seeking relief under
federal bankruptcy law leveled off in the second half of 1987, but
an Agriculture Department official says another upward surge could
occur this winter.
   As of Dec. 31, 6,664 bankruptcy filings under Chapter 12 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code had been reported by the U.S. federal court
system, said Steven R. Koenig of the department's Economic Research
Service.
   The new Chapter 12 provisions, which allow farmers to
restructure debts under specially designed rules, went into effect
on Nov. 26, 1986.
   Koenig said court records showed about 600 filings in the first
five weeks of the new Chapter 12 law. Those climbed to more than
2,300 in the first three months of 1987 and then eased back to
around 1,900 in the second quarter, 929 in the third quarter and to
923 in the fourth quarter.
   ``I would suspect that the filings would be up again this
winter, because that's when a lot of farmers' loans come up for
renewal _ during the winter months,'' Koenig said. ``I would think
that it would spike up a bit, but probably not like we saw last
winter. But, who knows?''
   Koenig's comments were in an interview and in a report in the
March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine published by the USDA
agency.
   ``The largest number of financially strapped farmers appear to
benefit from Chapter 12 through the increased negotiation power
they now have with their lenders, rather than through actually
filing a case,'' he said. ``With Chapter 12 looming, many lenders
agree to debt writedowns and restructuring in out-of-court
settlements.''
   Koenig said filings of debt reorganization plans have varied
greatly across the country, with some courts confirming large
number of the plans while other have not.
   ``Differing legal interpretations by the courts explain much of
this variation,'' he said. ``Legal confusion over Chapter 12 rules
and procedures abounds.''
   Koenig added: ``For farmers, the income tax consequences of
discharging their debt, selling their assets, and several other
facets of bankruptcy remain largerly unsettled. Internal Revenue
Service rulings and court decisions are still pending on many tax
issues, making a reorganization plan more uncertain.''
   Besides the unsettled tax questions, Koenig said ``the acid
test'' of Chapter 12 benefits will be when payments under the
court-confirmed debt restructuring plans come due. Payments in the
earliest confirmed cases are just now coming due.

   Winter wheat planted last fall for harvest
this summer is in ``mostly good-to-fair'' condition in some of the
nation's major production areas, a government report says.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday that wheat
during the week of Feb. 29 through March 6 was not quite in such
good shape in the northern Great Plains, Delta and Rocky Mountain
states, however.
   ``Snow cover was virtually non-existent in the central and
northern Great Plain and Rocky Mountain states, but mild
temperatures kept damage at a minimum,'' the report said. ``Snow,
preceding freezing temperatures, prevented severe winter damage to
small grain (including wheat) in eastern Kansas, northern Oklahoma,
Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Ohio.''
   Crop development by early March ranged from greening in Colorado
to jointing of plants in Mississippi and Oklahoma, and heading in
Arizona, the report said.
   The facility is operated by the departments of Commerce and
Agriculture. Reports do not forecast actual production of crops,
only the condition of fields and plants.
   In Kansas, the leading wheat state, fields had started to turn
green but had not reached the jointing stage of development, the
report said. Light cases of wheat streak mosaic were reported in
the eastern third of the state, and Russian wheat aphids were
``concentrated mostly in western areas of Kansas but posed no
serious threat thus far.''

   The Agriculture Department has some advice for
those who may be planning Easter dinners around hams.
   There are three types of hams most commonly found in
supermarkets, according to USDA home economists. Those are labeled
``ham'' or ``ham-with natural juices'' or ``ham-water added.''
   ``From the nutrition standpoint, the product labeled `ham' is
the highest protein, while `ham-with natural juices' is the next
highest, and `ham-water added' has the least,'' they said Tuesday
in a report.
   Those hams don't include another type, the country ham or
dry-cured ham that has been dried and cured with salt, smoked and
aged, the report said. Those are easy to identify from their burlap
wrappings.
   Country hams require special treatment and cooking procedures,
which are usually described on labels, the report said.

   Armenian nationalists today called on the
Politburo to protect their countrymen from ethnic attacks during a
Moslem celebration next week in the republic of Azerbaijan, a
spokesman said.
   Hovik Vassilian, a nationalist in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan, said Armenians fear that Azeris will launch violent
attacks during Iranian New Year celebrations, observed March 18-23
by Shiite Moslems.
   The republic of Azerbaijan borders Iran, and most Azeris are
Shiite Moslem. Most Armenians are Christian.
   Tension between Armenians and Azeris erupted in violence Feb. 28
in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. The unrest was triggered by
Armenian demands that Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian
district in Azerbaijan, be annexed to Armenia.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said today the death toll in the Sumgait rioting was 32, one more
than previously reported.
   The government blamed the deaths on hooligans provoked by rumors
of ethnic turmoil elsewhere. Some Armenian activists say the
violence was instigated by Azeris out of ethnic hatred, and they
claim the death toll was much higher.
   Vassilian said Armenian nationalists sent a telegram to the
ruling Communist Partry Politburo today to ask for protection
during the Moslem celebrations.
   He said Armenians also planned an hourlong general strike
throughout Armenia on Friday to underscore their concerns about
security.
   Gerasimov, speaking at a regular briefing, said Sumgait
residents were not allowed on the streets after 6 p.m. to maintain
order in the city.
   ``The situation is normal but passions are still running high
since people still remember what happened,'' he said when asked why
foreign reporters weren't being allowed into the area.
   Vassilian, editor of an underground journal called The Armenian
Cause, said by telephone that several hundred thousand Armenians
demonstrated Tuesday in Yerevan to mourn Armenians killed in the
turmoil.
   They placed flowers at the base of a monument to the estimated
1.5 million to 2 million Armenians killed in a 1915 Turkish
invasion, he said.
   Asked to estimate the crowd size, Vassilian said, ``There was no
room to stand. There must have been several hundred thousand
there.''
   Gerasimov said wreaths were laid at the monument, but he did not
say how many people attended.
   In Moscow, about 300 Armenians gathered Tuesday in a cemetery to
mourn the Armenian victims of ethnic violence and exchange tales of
how their countrymen were killed by Azeris. Their accounts could
not be independently verified.
   One man said he saw a pregnant woman and her unborn baby slain
and mutilated in Sumgait.
   A resident of a village near Sumgait said Azeris roved through
his settlement, looking under beds for Armenian children and raping
Armenian women. Another Armenian said children were thrown from
windows.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has indicated the Central
Committee will review the dispute at a forthcoming meeting.

   Vice President George Bush's Super Tuesday triumph
makes him the favorite to win the presidency, at odds of 4-to-9,
bookmaker William Hill said today.
   That means a $9 dollar bet on Bush would net $4 plus the
original stake.
   Next in line was Democrat Michael Dukakis at 4-1, followed by
Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., at 8-1. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a
Democrat, fetched odds of 10-1 despite staying out of the race.
Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., was quoted at 11-1, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson at 20-1 and Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., at 50-1.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans spent $8.3 billion keeping warm in
February, $340 million more than normal for the month, the federal
government estimated today.
   February was colder than the long-term average for the month,
pushing up bills for oil, natural gas and electricity used to heat
homes across most of the nation, according to the monthly report
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Heating bills were above normal for the month in every region
except New England and the Mountain and Pacific coast states, the
study reported.
   On average, American homeowners spent $115.72 for heat during
the month, $4.73 more than would have been expected with normal
February weather.
   Here is a regional rundown of the average cost of residential
heating in February, and the comparison to what would have been
expected in normal February weather.
   _Middle Atlantic: $159.52, $2.38 more than normal. Includes New
York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   _East North Central: $140.87, $13.14 more than normal. Includes
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   _New England: $136.58, $1.22 below normal. Includes Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   _West North Central: $126.42, $13.21 above normal. Includes
North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and
Missouri.

   The parent company of Great Scott Supermarkets
Inc. has removed frozen food bags that an Asian-American group
found offensive.
   The bags, which bore a caricature of a child with slanted eyes
and prominent teeth, carry the words ``Coolee bag for your
purchases of ice cream and frozen foods.''
   Unskilled Asians who worked for U.S. railroad companies in the
middle and late 19th century were called ``coolies.''
   ``Those kinds of things are just stupid,'' said David Fukuzawa,
director of American Citizens for Justice, an Asian-American civil

   Paul Coleman, a spokesman for Meadowdale Foods, Great Scott's

   Jesse Jackson said today that Super Tuesday
proved ``the Jackson message is winning'' and proclaimed the
primary season is erasing Democratic establishment doubts about the
viability of his campaign.
   He said if his cash-poor campaign had spent as much money as the
well-heeled forces of Michael Dukakis, ``it would have been a
different situation'' in the results.
   He acknowledged that the endorsements of white Democratic
politicans, many of them elected with support of the black voters
Jackson has helped register in recent years, went to Dukakis and
rivals Albert Gore Jr. and Richard Gephardt.
   `It would be fair to say that many of them had reasonable doubts
about the success of our campaign,'' Jackson said. ``In these
elections we are removing those doubts ... Our coalition represents
the future of the Democratic Party.''
   He said the white politicians will have to make choices, not
only about who can win, but which candidate ``can help them.''
   He also spoke about party unity and said the candidates should
not ``self destruct'' their chances in November by attacking each
other during the primary season.
   Jackson's rivals thus far have refrained from criticizing him,
but his campaign manager says the Jackson forces are prepared for
the possibility he will come under attack now that he has collected
a sizeable number of delegates.
   Jackson was heading today to Cicero, Ill, where voters go to the
polls next Tuesday. He was visiting the site of a General Electric
plant that is closing down, to show solidarity with workers who are
losing their jobs.
   ``Our campaign is winning,'' Jackson told jubilant supporters
Tuesday night. ``Our message is winning. We have the poorest
campaign, the richest message.''
   Jackson won big in Virginia and also won in the Deep South
states of Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
   He also came in second in the home states of his three main
rivals, Massachusetts, Tennessee and Missouri, home of Rep. Richard
Gephardt.
   `We're right where we wanted to be, and now it's on to North
Carolina and Illinois,'' said campaign manager Gerald Austin.
``Tonight Jesse Jackson became a valid candidate for president,
with an organization and with a message, and he just happens to be
black.''
   An exit poll by ABC News indicated that Jackson won 10 percent
of the white vote in the Super Tuesday contests, which included 14
Southern and border states.
   Jackson has vigorously courted sectors of the white population
in his campaign, principally the economically hard-pressed, the
unemployed, students, gays and lesbians.
   On Tuesday night, Jackson recalled the Selma, Ala., civil rights
march 23 years ago that was violently turned back at the bridge
into town by state troopers.
   ``The same state that wouldn't let us walk across the bridge _
we won that state today,'' Jackson said. ``America has won.''
   Jackson was joined at the celebration by his wife and mother and
other family members, and several political figures, including
District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry and Rep. Mickey Leland,
Jackson's campaign chairman in Texas. His longtime supporter, rock
disc jockey Casey Kasem, was the master of ceremonies.
   Jackson, who spent just $100,000 on Super Tuesday television
ads, contrasted his low-budget campaign to the multimillion-dollar
TV budgets of his opponents.
   He criticized the negative ads aired by his rivals as `party
bloodletting.'' That is ``a way to lose and we want to win,'' he
said.
   ``I'm not running against Gore or Dukakis or Gephardt on Super
Tuesday. I'm runing against George Bush in the Super Bowl in
November,'' he said.
   Austin said Jackson's success means he will now come under
increasing scrutiny by the media and attacks from other candidates.
   ``We are prepared for the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune that will come our way,'' he said.
   He said he anticipates the campaign will benefit from greater
fund-raising which has been on an upswing since the Feb. 8 Iowa
caucuses. The campaign raised $600,000 in February, a one-month
record for Jackson, he said.
   Decisions will have to be made on buying more media time than in
the past, especially in large states such as New York and
California, he said.
   This month, Jackson took out $400,000 in loans to keep his
campaign afloat for Super Tuesday.

<HEAD>Complaint Filed Against Judge For Remarks Backing Harold
Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A formal complaint has been filed against an
Illinois appellate judge for saying South Side residents who failed
to vote for the late Mayor Harold Washington ``ought to be hung.''
   The complaint Tuesday to the Illinois Courts Commission cited
comments made by Appellate Judge R. Eugene Pincham in a speech at
an Operation PUSH gathering on Jan. 31, 1987.
   Pincham mentioned the hanging of several slaves and white
collaborators during a 1741 slave rebellion in New York, then said,
``Any man south of Madison Street who casts a vote in the Feb. 24th
election who doesn't cast a vote for Harold Washington ought to be
hung as those were hung in New York.''
   The speech before the civil rights group was broadcast over
three Chicago-area radio stations. Washington won the election but
died Nov. 25, only a few months into his second term.
   Former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb filed the complaint on behalf of
the Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board, contending that the judge's
comments violated portions of the Illinois Code of Judicial Conduct.
   The code prohibits judges from participating in political
campaigns or activities unless they are candidates for office or
judicial retention.
   Pincham said his comments were protected by the First Amendment.
To punish him would violate his constitutional rights, he said,
adding that he would continue with his own court challenge to the
complaint.
   Pincham had attempted to avoid action by the Judicial Inquiry
Board by filing a lawsuit on First Amendment grounds in U.S.
District Court, but that suit was dismissed last week. Pincham said
he would appeal that ruling.
   The Illinois Courts Commission will set hearings on the board's
complaint.

<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   George Bush's powerful Super Tuesday punch packed such a wallop
it knocked Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson flat and left Bob Dole
scrambling in Illinois today to regain his footing in the
industrial Midwest.
   Dole was out campaigning today in the western Chicago suburb of
Hinsdale, where he visited a commuter train station and gulped
coffee and a pastry before television cameras at a restaurant
counter across the street.
   ``It will be up to Illinois now to turn it around,'' Dole told
one supporter.
   Robertson said today that Bush ``just ran a fabulous race.'' He
also said, in an interview on ABC-TV: ``I was running against the
ghost of Ronald Reagan, not against George Bush.''
   While Robertson vowed to stay in the race, Kemp was meeting with
his advisers to determine the future of his campaign. A spokeswoman
said that Kemp, who got no better than 7 percent of the vote in any
of Tuesday's primaries, would have a news conference Thursday.
   An exhilarated Bush said Tuesday night that the voters' message
was clear: ``I'm going to be the next president of the United
States.''
   The vice president was victorious in 16 of 17 GOP contests
Tuesday, most of them in the South. He won a shutout in the
primaries, though Robertson did win Washington state's caucuses.
   ``This is a unique political happening,'' Bush told cheering
supporters in Houston as his lopsided victory became apparent. ``It
exceeded my fondest expectations.''
   While Dole hadn't expected to dominate Super Tuesday, he'd hoped
for a better showing than the distant runner-up status to which he
was relegated.
   He began focusing on next week's Illinois primary even before
Tuesday's results were final, telling a crowd of supporters in
Chicago: ``Illinois is getting more and more important as the
evening wears on.''
   ``This is going to be Bob Dole's recovery state,'' he said.
``It's going to be the turnaround state.''
   Robertson, who earlier had predicted he'd emerge from Super
Tuesday as the GOP front-runner, insisted his third-place showing
still was respectable.
   ``It isn't too bad for an amateur but it isn't near what I
expected,'' said the former television evangelist.
   Kemp kept out of public view as Super Tuesday voters designated
him their last choice. Aides said he'd be reassessing his candidacy.
   Super Tuesday's balloting represented a dramatic comeback for
Bush, who just a month earlier had been reeling from a third-place
finish behind Dole and Robertson in Iowa.
   Damaged but not destroyed, Bush managed to hang on to a
slimmed-down lead in New Hampshire a week later, and his
self-portrait as loyal sidekick to Ronald Reagan was well-received
in the South.
   Bush claimed most of the 712 delegates at stake Tuesday, adding
them to the 126 he'd amassed in earlier contests. That put him well
on the way to the 1,139 needed to land the GOP nomination.
   His Super Tuesday victories reached across the nation, including
delegate-rich Florida and Texas. He also triumphed in Tennessee,
Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Arkansas, North Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Oklahoma and Missouri.
   Robertson conceded he'd been damaged by some unusual comments
he'd made on the campaign trail, such as his insistence there are
Soviet missiles in Cuba, claims his Christian Broadcasting Network
at one point knew the whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon
and his assertions that disclosure of the Jimmy Swaggart sex
scandal had been timed to hurt his candidacy.
   ``I spoke too much and I should have kept my mouth shut but I
was misinterpreted,'' he said.
   But he shrugged off any suggestion that the damage was
irreparable or that he would join forces with Dole in a stop-Bush
offensive, saying ``it looks like the one that may come out of
Illinois is going to be Pat Robertson rather than Bob Dole.''
   ``I, right now, am going to be the rallying point for those who
don't want George Bush as the nominee of the party.''
   Dole, meanwhile, was challenging Bush to a series of debates
``all over Illinois, one on one, no moderator, no notes, stand up
and have it out.''
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, didn't welcome the
invitation.
   ``There just doesn't seem to be any point in following the other
guy's campaign schedule,'' he said.
   Bush, however, was ready to fight Dole for Illinois' 82
delegates. While Dole thus far has dominated contests in the
Midwest and has a strong organization in Illinois, Bush is
supported by Illinois Gov. James Thompson and 93 of the state's 102
GOP county chairmen.
   The vice president planned to fly to Chicago Thursday.

   Gallaudet University students threatened to
withdraw from the school for the deaf as a protest over the
appointment of a hearing woman as president entered its fourth day
today.
   Gallaudet board of trustees chairwoman Jane Bassett Spilman said
the decision to hire Elisabeth Ann Zinser will stand, and scheduled
a press conference today for herself and the new president.
   At a campus rally Tuesday night, student leaders said that up to
two-thirds of the school's 2,200 undergraduate and graduate
students might withdraw Thursday if Zinser is not replaced with a
deaf president.
   Psychology professor Neil Reynolds, who chairs two faculty
groups, said they will meet today to discuss the controversy over
Zinser's selection, and could vote to suspend classes.
   ``There has been in the past week an escalation of overt support
from faculty members for a deaf president,'' said Reynolds, who
chairs the school's 21-member faculty senate and a group that
includes the entire faculty. ``This is definitely a change.''
   When school officials announced Sunday that Zinser, an
administrator at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro,
had prevailed over two deaf finalists, students staged protest
marches to the Capitol, forced closure of the school Monday, and
boycotted classses Tuesday.
   Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., a member of Gallaudet's board of
trustees, said Congress might consider scaling back funding for the
school if the conflict over Zinser's appointment is not resolved.
   ``I'm concerned it has the potential to hurt the funding of the
university, especially when you have leaders from both sides going
out of their way to express themselves on this,'' Bonior said.
   Bonior, the chief deputy majority whip in the House, said he has
been meeting privately with university officials, and intends to
ask Zinser ``whether she is indeed interested in coming into an
environment that is as hostile as it is.''
   Gallaudet, founded in 1864 by an act of Congress, is the
nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf. Last year, federal
funding accounted for $62.2 million of Gallaudet's $76 million
operating budget.
   Spilman said the selection of Zinser, a vice chancellor for
academic affairs at Greensboro, ``was a vote cast in the best
interests of the university.''
   Zinser, who prevailed by a 10-4 margin over two deaf finalists,
``was selected for one and only one reason _ she was the best
person qualified,'' Spilman said.
   The students claim that by picking Zinser, who doesn't know sign
language, the board of trustees has shown it has no understanding
of the importance deaf students place on having a deaf leader.
Including Zinser, none of the school's seven presidents has been
deaf.
   ``The alumni sympathize with and support the students,'' Gerald
Burstein, president of the school's alumni organization, said at a
campus rally Tuesday. ``We _ unlike hearing members on the board _
know fully what it is like to be deaf.''
   ``I'm behind the students 100 percent,'' said Prof. Herbert
Maples, chairman of Gallaudet's math department, who is deaf.
``Something has to be done about this situation.''
   Thirty percent of Gallaudet's faculty and 22 percent of the
school's 1,300-member support staff is deaf, according to
university publicist Barbara Dennis.
   The National Association of the Deaf is planning to have state
representatives from the 20,000-member organization meet in
Washington Friday to discuss ways to help the protesting students,
said Fred Weiner, a Washington spokesman for the group.
   Students vowed to continue their protest until they achieve
their goal.
   ``We will not give up until we have a deaf president,'' said
Jerry Covell, a leader of the student protest. ``We will just keep
trying.''
   Students also want Spilman replaced, and a plan to make deaf
persons a majority on the board of trustees. The 20-member board
now has four deaf members.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan was urged today to award the
Medal of Freedom posthumously to three American journalists killed
by Soviet troops while covering the eight-year Afghanistan war.
   Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J., introduced a resolution in the House
urging Reagan to give the nation's highest civilian award to
relatives of Charles E. Thornton, a medical reporter for the
Arizona Republic in Phoenix, and independent filmmakers Lee Shapiro
of North Bergen, N.J., and Jim Lindelof of Sacramento, Calif.
   Thornton was killed in an ambush by Soviet troops on Sept. 19,
1985, while preparing a story on volunteer doctors in Afghanistan.
Shapiro and Lindelof, a paramedic serving as soundman for a
documentary being filmed by Shapiro, were killed Oct. 9, 1987, when
they were strafed by Soviet helicopter gunships and shot by Soviet
soldiers who confiscated their cameras and film. Their bodies have
never been returned from Afghanistan.
   ``The journalists' only `crime' was in bringing a trace of
glasnost to the most brutal war of the decade,'' Courter told a
news conference. ``Unable to completely conquer the Afghan
resistance, the Soviets have committed themselves to a policy of
tracking down and murdering Western journalists in an attempt to
prevent the rest of the world from learning of the Afghans' valiant
struggle for freedom.''
   Courter's resolution is cosponsored by Reps. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
and Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif. The same appeal to Reagan will be
introduced in the Senate next week by Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   The resolution urges Reagan to award the Medal of Freedom
posthumously to the three journalists at a White House ceremony on
March 21, the Afghan new year which the president designated last
year as ``Afghanistan Day.''
   ``The great courage displayed by these American heroes in facing
the dangers of war and a lethal Soviet threat against them as
correspondents should not go unrecognized,'' Matsui said.
   Linda Shapiro, the filmmaker's widow, said her husband was
``sought out and deliberately gunned down for telling the truth''
about the war. She urged continued U.S. support for the Afghan
rebels, and promised to finish her husband's documentary.
   Bill Lindelof, a reporter for the Sacramento Bee, said his
brother originally went to Afghanistan to provide medical treatment
for Afghan war refugees.
   ``He did so much and unselfishly, and this (award) would be sort
of something in his memory,'' Lindelof said. ``It would say that
Jim did all he could, and it was appreciated.''

<HEAD>Non-OPEC Producers Meet To Debate Price Strategy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts from non-OPEC oil producing nations met
today to debate moves aimed at halting plunging oil prices, said a
spokesman at the Mexican Embassy, which served as host of the
gathering.
   The meeting was called by Egypt but was held in London because
it was a more convenient location than Cairo.
   Apart from Egypt, the other invited participants were the Soviet
Union, China, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman, Mexico and Colombia.
   Britain, which rejects group pricing policies for its North Sea
oil, was not invited. Norway, another European producer, declined
to attend.
   ``The meeting is at expert level with no ministers involved,''
said a Mexican spokesman, who declined to be identified. ``They
just want to talk about the situation in the market, although
obviously they are not in any position to take a decision.''
   On Tuesday, Oil Minister Abdel-Hady Kandil of Egypt said the
meeting was not against the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, ``but is an attempt by non-OPEC producers to
help save the world oil market from further deterioration.''
   There was speculation that OPEC may call an emergency meeting
about the oil price drop, due partly to increased output by
non-OPEC producers and a mild winter in Japan and Europe.
   North Sea Brent crude for April delivery was quoted at $14.20 to
$14.30 a barrel in London today. At its December meeting in Vienna,
OPEC pledged to defend a price of $18 a barrel.

   Israel's divided government today refused to
endorse a U.S. plan designed to end more than three months of
violence in the Israeli-occupied lands. Troops killed one Arab and
wounded 10 others in clashes.
   Palestinians staged a general strike in observance of another
``martyrs' day'' to honor the Arabs killed since the
anti-occupation unrest began Dec. 8.
   The death brought the confirmed death toll from the rioting to
85 since Dec. 8. U.N. figures now put the number killed at 90,
including five Arabs who died from tear gas inhalation. However,
there was no independent confirmation that the five Arabs included
in the U.N. count died as a result of the riots.
   Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian in the West Bank
village of Silwad, 10 miles northeast of Ramallah, the army said.
   Officials at Ramallah Hospital said Mohammed Ochman Sarris, 22,
died of a gunshot wound to the back. They said another Palestinian
from Silwad was admitted with a gunshot wound to the thigh.
   In clashes in Nablus in the West Bank, officials at Al Ittihad
Hospital said seven Palestinians from the nearby Faraa refugee camp
were hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the legs, hands and side.
   Another Palestinian from the village of Masha, 15 miles west of
Nablus, was treated for a gunshot wound to the left leg, the
officials said.
   Officials at Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus said a Palestinian
from Jenin, 20 miles to the north, was shot in the shoulder.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir successfully defeated attempts by
the left-of-center Labor Party to force a vote in the 10-member
inner Cabinet on a peace plan offered by U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who has accepted the Shultz plan,
attacked Shamir's refusal in a speech in Parliament.
   ``We might miss this historic opportunity, and we won't have an
answer, not for our generation and not for those to coe, as to why
we became afraid of peace,'' said Peres, leader of the Labor Party.
``Why did we reject the outstretched hand because of imaginary
fears?'
   In clashes near Qalqilya in the West Bank, Israeli armored
personnel carriers fired pebbles at demonstrators with a newly
developed riot-control device, Israel radio said. The gravel-firing
gun was used for this first time this week, it said.
   The ``martyrs' day'' strike closed shops throughout the West
Bank and the occupied Gaza Strip and kept most of the 110,000 Arabs
who work in Israel away from their jobs, an army spokesman and the
Palestine Press Service said.
   Army spokesmen said the only exception to the general strike was
the Tulkarem area near the Israeli town of Kfar Saba, where some
workers ignored the boycott.
   In the West Bank town of Halhoul, an empty Israeli-owned bus
used to carry Arab workers to their jobs was burned in front of the
municipal building, the Palestine Press Service said.
   It said Arabs demonstrated at a dozen locations in Gaza Strip
refugee camps and towns and shouted Palestine Liberation
Organization slogans, raised Palestinian flags and threw stones.
   About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Ezer Weizman, a Labor minister-without-portfolio, said ``the
government is split 50-50'' over the U.S. peace plan.
   Shultz, who brought the peace initiative to the Arab and Israeli
leaders last week, had asked Shamir to bring Israel's response to
Washington for talks with President Reagan on March 14. Labor
leaders had hoped to commit Shamir to accept before he left.
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said the prime minister
``opposed most of the ideas'' in the U.S. plan and sought to talk
the Americans into making changes.
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, objects to Shultz's
call for an international conference by May 1. He also opposes a
proposal that talks on the final status of the occupied lands begin
in December, even if agreement had not been reached on Palestinian
self-rule.
   Ahimeir said that for the first time, Shamir will suggest an
agreement with Jordan on a step-by-step plan for implementing
self-rule quickly in a limited area of the West Bank or Gaza.
   ``The idea is to make autonomy work in a limited area such as
Nablus or Hebron and then enlarge it until it is in force in all of
the territories,'' Ahimeir said.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet official acknowledged today that his
country had supplied missiles to Iraq, but he said their range was
too short to strike Iranian cities.
   The statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
was believed to be the first time the Soviet Union acknowledged
shipping missiles to Iraq, Iran's enemy in a 7{-year-old war.
   The Soviets have been Iraq's chief arms supplier.
   Western military analysts say Iraq has been using Scud-B
missiles, fitted with strap-on boosters for added power, in recent
attacks on the Iranian capital, Tehran. The city is 290 miles from
the Iran-Iraq border.
   Iran also uses Scud-Bs in its attacks on Iraqi cities.
   The missiles have a range of 190 miles.
   On Sunday, Iranian media reports blamed the Soviet Union for the
missile attacks on Iran, prompting an angry mob in Tehran to try to
storm the Soviet Embassy.
   Gerasimov, asked about the Iranian charges at a government news
briefing, said Soviet missiles had been shipped to Iraq under an
agreement between the two countries.
   ``The Soviet Union previously delivered a limited shipment of
short-range missiles,'' he said. ``We never gave our permission to
modify those missiles to increase their range, and modernization
was not foreseen by that agreement.''
   Gerasimov said the agreement ``ruled out'' modernizing the
missiles.
   ``This is the basis on which we're insisting that we have
nothing to do with the `war of the cities,''' he said.
   Iraq claims the missiles are Iraqi-made.
   Another Soviet Foreign Ministry official, Vsevolod L. Oleandrov,
was asked at the briefing if he believes the Iraqi claims. After a
long pause he said, ``It's difficult for us to say.''

   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon said today his
presidential hopes are riding on a home-state primary victory next
week, and he said he still can get the Democratic nomination
despite sitting out Super Tuesday.
   ``I'm going to finish first in Illinois,'' said Simon. ``If I
don't I'm going to have to re-evaluate,'' he said in an interview
on Cable News Network.
   Simon said the strong showings of rivals Michael Dukakis, Jesse
Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. on Tuesday showed that the Democrats
won't have a candidate picked before their convention in July.
   ``Nobody's going to have that first-ballot nomination, and then
groups are going to start leaving one candidate or another, going
to someone who is going to be generally acceptable,'' he said. ``I
think I fit that. But, I also have to win in Wisconsin or Ohio or
Pennsylvania or New York.''
   ``There is no question that if I can do it in Illinois, we're
going to pick up some states after Illinois,'' he said.
   Simon, his campaign strapped for cash, sat out the 20-state
Super Tuesday campaign in favor of concentrating on his home-state
primary next week, as part of what he calls a Midwest industrial
strategy.
   The Simon campaign has missed one payroll and is in danger of
missing a second, said spokeswoman Pam Huey. Simon also said
Tuesday the campaign was paying cash for expenses and hoped to
avoid borrowing any more money, but had enough federal matching
funds to cover its existing debt.
   February fund-raisers generated about $932,000 and federal
matching funds totaled $364,000, said Simon spokesman Terry
Michael. The campaign owes about $145,000 but is in ``pretty solid
condition as a result of not going into debt'' for Super Tuesday,
Michael said.
   ``We have a really small payroll, and we didn't make the big TV
buys others did for March 8,'' he said.
   But Simon doesn't plan to spend for television advertising in
Illinois either, again looking to future races.
   ``It would be foolish for us to make a big TV buy when we don't
even know what the other candidates are going to do,'' Michael said.
   ``We need a lift from Illinois. With that help we can raise
additional money so we can be more competitive in the states after
Illinois,'' he added.
   Simon is eyeing his fellow Illinois candidate _ Jackson, who
makes his home in Chicago.
   Some Jackson supporters have called on Simon to get out of the
race before Illinois, contending the Democratic senator will only
siphon votes from Jackson with no hope of victory himself.
   ``I've heard more people say Jesse should get out of the race
because he's hurting me, but I'm not calling for him to drop out,''
Simon countered.
   Simon has pitched himself in recent days as the consensus
candidate, the man most likely to get the nomination in Atlanta if
no clear favorite emerges from the primaries.
   ``Any candidate winning enough of the remaining delegates to
secure a clear first ballot victory is becoming a mathematical and
political improbability,'' he said.
   ``Right now, with no Mr. Inevitable in the race, it's going to
be a situation where the one who gets hottest at the end wil be in
the best possible position to negotiate a first ballot victory,''
Michael said.
   ``So really, you just have to hang in there and hope to get hot
at the end.''

<HEAD>Surgeon General Says Masters and Johnson Irresponsible on AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said today
that claims about the spread of AIDS among heterosexuals by
researchers Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson are unproven
and irresponsible.
   Koop, interviewed from London on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America'', said the sex experts have no scientific evidence to back
claims that AIDS among heterosexuals is ``rampant,'' that the
disease can be spread by casual non-sexual contact or that the
nation's blood supply is unsafe.
   ``In as much as some very wild claims were made, we have to be
very careful,'' Koop said.
   The government's top medical officer was reacting to widely
publicized findings from a new Masters and Johnson book,
co-authored by Dr. Robert Kolodny, ``Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior
in the Age of AIDS.'' Excerpts from the book appeared in this
week's Newsweek magazine.
   Koop noted that Masters and Johnson did not submit their
findings to scientific review or have them published in a
recognized medical journal.
   ``I think it is irresponsible. It is scare tactics,'' Koop said.
   The couple has published several books based on surveys of
Americans' sexual activities and attitudes. The new book calls for
widespread mandatory testing for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome infections, and estimates there are 3 million or more AIDS
carriers in the United States. The government estimates up to 1.5
million.
   Koop acknowledged that there is an explosion of AIDS among
heterosexuals in Africa but said ``the United States is not like
Africa... That's not going to happen here.''
   He said heterosexuals have accounted for only 4 percent of AIDS
cases in the United States and this is expected to increase to 5
percent by 1991.
   Scientists say the disease is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from infected pregnant women to their
offspring. The chief victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug abusers.
   Koop said if there were any truth to the suggestion that AIDS is
spread through other means, the government would be warning against
it. ``We have never gotten ahead of our scientific base, and that's
something the American people can rely on,'' he said.
   He said that among more than 50,000 AIDS cases so far in the
United States, ``not one single one was proven to be transmitted by
casual non-sexual contact.''
   ``AIDS is very hard to catch,'' said Koop.

   Iran and Iraq bombarded each others'
capitals with missiles today for the 10th day. Iran said 35 people
were killed in Tehran and Iraq reported Baghdad residents died when
a missile wrecked homes and stores.
   Each side in the 7{-year-old war vowed to continue its missile,
air and artillery assaults on population centers until the other
halts the attacks.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said the Revolutionary Guards Corps fired two missiles
into Baghdad, one at 10 a.m. and the second five minutes later.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
said only one missile exploded in the city of 5 million. It said
the missile demolished houses and stores, ``killing or wounding
numbers of civilians.''
   The Iraqi army retaliated by firing an Al Hussein missile, named
after the Shiite Moslem saint, into Tehran at 11:24 a.m., the
agency said.
   Iran said it hit a residential district, killing 35 people,
wounding 120, knocking down buildings and burying people under the
rubble. Among the survivors was an 80-year-old woman dragged from
the debris by rescue workers, it said.
   Iran claims to have fired 29 missiles into Baghdad, the northern
city of Mosul and the southern town of Al-Amarah since the missile
exchange began Feb. 29. The Iraqis have acknowledged 24 hits.
   Iraq has reported firing 46 missiles into Tehran, the holy city
of Qom, 100 miles south of the Iranian capital, and the central
city of Isfahan during the same period.
   Iraqi communiques said Iranian artillery pounded the southern
port of Basra and Al-Amarah during the night, killing ``many
civilians.''
   The Iraqi News Agency said the Iranian shells rained down on
densely populated residential areas in Basra. It said that among
the dead were four children buried under the rubble of their home
after it took a direct hit.
   The agency said the shelling spread to Qurnah, 30 miles north of
Basra, and Zubair, south of Basra.
   Gulf-based salvage executives said today that an Iraqi warplane
fired a missile at a Cypriot oil tanker carrying Iranian oil in the
Persian Gulf on Tuesday. The shipping executives, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said 101,977-ton Felicity sustained minor
damage.
   Baghdad's government-run Al Thawra daily said in an editorial
that Iraq will go on ``hitting new Iranian targets every day to
shatter the lies of the charlatans in Tehran'' until Iran accepts
the U.N. Security Council's July 20 cease-fire resolution.
   Iraq has said it will comply with the resolution, but Iran
demands that Iraq must be branded the aggressor before it will
agree to a cease-fire.
   The commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' air wing,
Mohsen Refan, said that if Iraq continues its ``atrocities in the
war of the cities, we will increase our missile attacks on Baghdad
manyfold and attack other Iraqi cities with our missiles.''
   He said Iraq has suffered more than Iran recently because ``our
missiles have four times the destructive force'' of Iraq's weapons
and are more accurate.
   The Iranians charge that the Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms
supplier, provided Baghdad with the long-range missiles capable of
hitting Tehran.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
acknowledged today that the Soviets supplied Iraq with missiles,
but he said their range was too short to hit Iranian cities and
that the Soviets never gave Iraq permission to modify the missiles
to extend their range.
   Both Iran and Iraq have Soviet-built Scud-Bs, which have a range
of 190 miles. Baghdad, only 80 miles from the border, is within
easy range of the Iranian batteries.
   To hit Tehran, 290 miles from the frontier, the Iraqis need
longer range weapons. Analysts say the Iraqis attach booster
rockets to the Scuds to give them the range to hit Tehran.

   Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Humayun Rashid
Chowdhury met today with U.S. diplomats in a bid to recruit their
support for his government against opposition charges of election
fraud, officials said.
   Chowdhury, who came here on his own initiative, met with Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead and with another, lower-level
State Department representative, said the officials who spoke on
condition they not be named.
   ``There are all sorts of groups in Bangladesh trying to involve
us in their political process. We're not interested in getting
involved,'' said one official.
   ``What we intend to tell him is that Bangladesh has to solve its
own internal problems,'' he added. The United States favors
political reforms but they have to come from within Bangladesh, he
added.
   Chowdhury's government, headed by President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad, won a landslide victory in last week's parliamentary
elections, but a group of 21 opposition parties boycotted the
balloting and charged that it was fraudulent.
   At least 11 people were reported killed and hundreds wounded in
violence connected with the March 3 elections. Ershad, a former
army general, came to power in 1982 in a bloodless coup and was
elected president in 1986 in elections which the opposition also
declared were rigged.
   The United States is providing Ershad's government with about
$130 million in economic support this year and the same amount for
1989, most of it for food and basic commodities. Bangladesh has a
population of 105 million.
   Chowdhury, who arrived here Tuesday, also discussed economic and
regional developments, the officials said, and he scheduled
meetings with members of Congress.

<HEAD>Hunt for Two Men in Three Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMERSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities were hunting today for
two men suspected in a three-state crime spree, including the
killings of three men in Arkansas and Texas.
   Police also were investigating whether the men were responsible
a bank robbery and the slaying of a 23-year-old woman.
   The search was focusing on southern Oklahoma, where a car
belonging to one of the victims, Kenneth Olden, was found. The two
suspects were believed to have fled on foot, authorities said.
   The suspects were described as two 18-to 20-year-old white men,
one weighing about 190 pounds, with blond, curly hair, and another
with stocky build and long, black hair.
   The bodies of Cecil Floyd Morrison, 85, and his son, Cecil
Leonard Morrison, were found in their Collin County, Texas, home
Monday night after Arkansas officials found their pickup truck
partially submerged in a lake there.
   Ammunition and a check stub with the Morrison's address were
found inside the truck, and Arkansas officials alerted Texas police.
   ``They had been struck in the head several times with a tire
iron or tire tool and wooden club,'' said Sgt. Anthony Hancock of
the Collin County sheriff's office. The men had also been shot in
the face, authorities said.
   The two men suspected in the Morrison deaths are also being
sought in connection with the death of Olden, 34, whose body was
found Tuesday morning on a rural road outside Saratoga, in
southwest Arkanas. He had been shot three times, said Hempstead
County, Ark., Sheriff Don Worthy.
   A car belonging to one of the victims was found Tuesday
submerged in a pond in Marietta, Okla., near the Texas border north
of Dallas. Collin County, where the Morrisons lived, is east of
Dallas.
   Authorities were looking at the fourth killing and the bank
robbery to see if they were related to the three slayings.
   ``Olden and those two (in Texas) we feel are connected, but we
haven't gotten a link to the woman and the robbery,'' said
Hempstead County Sheriff's Deputy Tom Witt.
   Deana Andrews Woodard, 23, was found dead in her Gainesville
home, a few miles south of the Texas-Oklahoma border, Monday
afternoon. Her throat had been cut and a bloody ax was found near
her body, said the Cooke County sheriff's office. Her infant son
was unharmed.
   Earlier Monday, three gunmen robbed The First National Bank of
Seminole in Oklahoma, authorities said.
   The gunmen forced four employees and one customer into a
restroom while one suspect took money from the bank's vault, said
FBI spokesman Dan Vogel. The FBI recovered most of the stolen cash
in Muskogee, Okla.

<HEAD>Robertson Still In Race But Starting To Talk About 1992</HEAD>

   Pat Robertson said today he'll keep fighting for
the Republican presidential nomination because ``you never know
what will happen between now and August,'' but a pile of
third-place finishes on Super Tuesday was enough to start him
talking about 1990 and beyond.
   ``The mantle of Ronald Reagan has passed to George Bush,''
Robertson said at a news conference today. ``None of us could have
dreamed that he could be so strong.''
   ``It isn't over yet,'' the former television evangelist added.
``Still half of the delegates are to be selected.''
   In separate comments, on ABC-TV, ``I was running against the
ghost of Ronald Reagan. In the South the love of Ronald Reagan is
so deep with these people, and George Bush is totally identified
with him.''
   Robertson, who said earlier his showing wasn't ``too bad for an
amateur,'' said, ``I'm in it for the long haul, for this time, for
1990, the congressional races, and who knows what will happen in
1992.''
   ``Politics are so erratic in America,'' Robertson said. ``You
never know what will happen between now and August.''
   Robertson conceded Vice President George Bush ``beat the
daylights out of us'' in Tuesday's voting, but he assured several
hundred cheering supporters in an Atlanta hotel ballroom Tuesday
night: ``This is not the end. This is just the beginning.
   ``We're going to New Orleans. I'm going to be the conservative
champion for everyone who wants to rally around the conservative
cause in this nation,'' he said.
   ``I'm in all the way. I'm in to see a Republican conservative
Congress in 1990 and we're in for the presidential race in 1992.''
   Robertson said his campaign has brought thousands of
conservatives into the Republican Party ``for the long haul.''
   ``They're in the process and American politics won't be the same
in this century,'' he promised.
   In this campaign, Robertson said, his supporters have worked the
caucuses and dominated the delegate selection process in many
states. When the Republican National Convention convenes in New
Orleans this summer, there will be many more Robertson supporters
than the numbers might suggest, he said.
   ``For one vote the Georgia delegation is bound (to Bush). Beyond
that, the Georgia delegation will be a Pat Robertson delegation.
The same is true in Oklahoma, North Carolina, the state of
Washington, most likely, and many other states _ Hawaii, Alaska and
Nevada,'' he said.
   Although he gained only a handful of delegates in Tuesday's
voting, Robertson told reporters he had greatly improved ``on my
early ratings 10 months ago when I was laughed at with 3 percent.''
   Robertson called the performance ``not too bad for an amateur,
but it's not nearly what I expected.''
   The former television evangelist said he may have spread his
campaign too thin by running in all the Super Tuesday states.
   ``I didn't have the concentration I should have had in ky
states. I tried to play (to) everyone in the South,'' he said. ``We
just didn't have the resources to compete with George Bush.''
   Robertson admitted his campaign was hurt by controversy over
several statements he had made _ trying to tie the Bush campaign to
the timing of revelations about the sex scandal involving
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart; saying his Christian Broadcasting
Network reporters had known where some hostages were being held in
the Middle East, and proclaiming that the Soviet Union has missiles
in Cuba.
   ``I spoke too much and I should have kept my mouth shut,'' he
said.
   But he blamed the news media for much of the controversy. ``I
was misinterpreted,'' he said.

<HEAD>Researcher Says AIDS Epidemic Causing Increase In TB</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worldwide AIDS epidemic is causing an upsurge
in tuberculosis in many countries, including the United States, a
researcher from the World Health Organization said today.
   Dr. Gary Slutkin told the First International Conference on the
Global Impact of AIDS that tuberculosis rates are going up in areas
worst hit by acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   About 1,100 specialists from 20 countries are attending the
conference at London's Barbican Center.
   Slutkin said the reason appears to be that AIDS suppresses
immunity to tuberculosis, a lung infection.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a variety of infections and cancers.
   Slutkin, an epidemiologist, said the number of TB cases in the
United States increased between 1985 and 1986 for the first time
since records have been kept on the disease.
   He said the number of TB cases went up from 22,201 in 1985 to
22,768 in 1986.
   The largest increases in TB in the United States occurred in New
York City, where the rate jumped by about 50 percent between 1981
and 1986, Slutkin said. He said there also have been increases in
TB rates in 25 states and in Washington, D.C.
   He said that in Africa, where AIDS is prevalent, 20 percent to
50 percent of TB patients tested positively for the AIDS virus.
That's three to 20 times higher than the rest of the population.
   Slutkin told reporterst the scale of the expected increases in TB due
to
AIDS, Slutkin said, ``I think we should certainly expect to see
increases in the number of cases of tuberculosis in the next five
years. In fact, it's almost certainly already occurring in many
countries.''
   Other speakers at the conference today discussed the economic
and social impact of the AIDS epidemic, which has spread to 133
countries.
   Anne Scitovsky, the chief health economist for the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation in California, estimated that the direct cost of
treating AIDS patients in the United States will probably increase
by eight-fold to $8.5 billion by 1991.
   Indirect costs from lost wages and future earnings could soar to
$55.6 billion by 1991, she said.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   A woman armed with a toy gun
failed in an attempt to rob a doughnut shop, but bit the baker who
subdued her, police said.
   Police arrived at the Winchell's Donut House Tuesday to find the
``exhausted'' 59-year-old baker, Jay Anderson, holding a
36-year-old woman down on the floor, the police report said.
   The woman entered the shop at about 4 a.m. and bought a
chocolate doughnut. When the baker opened the cash register, the
woman pulled a gun from under her jacket and said ``Give me all of
it or I'll kill you,'' the report said.
   Anderson stood back and told her to take the money herself.
While the woman had her hands in the till, he grabbed her and
pulled her across the counter. The gun, which Anderson believed to
be real, came out of the woman's hand and broke apart.
   After wrestling with the woman for what ``seemed like forever,''
the baker said he got to the phone and called police. Meanwhile,
the woman was kicking and punching him continuously, and also
``took a bite out of his arm,'' the report said.
   Anderson was treated at a nearby hospital and released. Police
said the woman would be charged with aggravated robbery, but
refused to release her name immediately.

<HEAD>Baker: Rhode Island National Guard Not Invading Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker today
denied that the United States is planning an invasion of Panama,
saying American troops there are merely holding regularly scheduled
training exercises.
   ``Panama is the site of National Guard training exercises and
has been for years,'' Baker said. ``And as I understand it, the
Rhode Island National Guard is now holding regularly scheduled
exercises in Panama.
   ``And certainly if the United States was going to invade Panama,
it wouldn't be with the Rhode Island National Guard. So it simply
is not so. It has no connection at all,'' Baker said, talking with
reporters at the White House after seeing President Reagan off on a
trip to Indiana.
   Jorge Abadia, Panama's foreign minister, on Tuesday accused the
United States of conducting ``the prelude of an armed invasion'' by
staging military exercises along the Panama Canal.
   The U.S. Southern Command said the exercises were scheduled a
year ago and were ``routine training.''

   Republican George Bush took a breather today
after the landslide Super Tuesday victories that he said made it
virtually sure he'll be the next president.
   Bush was relaxing in private today but planned to rejoin the
campaign Thursday in Illinois, which has its primary next Tuesday.
   In Washington, meanwhile, White House chief of staff Howard
Baker said today ``it would take a major event'' to prevent Bush
from winning the Republican nomination. He said there is no sign
President Reagan is about to endorse anyone.
   Bush, the winner in 16 of 17 states with GOP contests, said:
``This is a unique political happening. It exceeded my fondest
expectations.''
   Just hours after the vice president's top aides said he would
not accede to Sen. Bob Dole's demand for one-on-one debates in
Illinois, Bush appeared before a crowd of supporters to declare ``a
national victory.''
   Bush was getting a respite from the campaign wars today as he
and his wife, Barbara, remained in seclusion at their Houstonian
Hotel condominium while aides held strategy sessions for next
Tuesday's Illinois primary.
   Bush's election performance on Tuesday was stunning. After
winning the South Carolina primary on Saturday, he captured
delegate-rich Florida and Texas, and scored other victories
throughout the South. He pushed his delegate total toward 700,
close to two-thirds the number needed for nomination in New Orleans
next August.
   ``This will probably be the single most smashing win anyone's
ever had from the standpoint of delegates in one day,'' exulted
campaign manager Lee Atwater. ``A Guiness Book of Records day.''
   ``Bob Dole is on the canvas now,'' said Bush's deputy campaign
manager, Richard Bond. ``I don't think he's knocked out, though.''
   Top Bush aides said they saw no benefit in the vice president
meeting Dole in the kind of Lincoln-Douglas face-to-face debates
the Kansas senator demanded on Tuesday.
   Atwater called Dole's maneuver ``an eleventh-hour ploy'' and
Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said: ``We're not going to allow him to
dictate how we run our campaign strategy in Illinois.''
   Bush will fly to Chicago tomorrow to kick off five days of
intensive campaigning. ``We look very strong there,'' Teeley said.
   But on Tuesday night, it was Bush's turn to bask in the glory of
his finest political hour in more than 20 years in public life.
   After watching returns for about two hours with members of his
family and political associates gathered in a 21st floor penthouse
hotel suite, Bush entered a ballroom to the cheers of supporters.
   ``As I said yesterday, whoever wins Super Tuesday convincingly
is going to be the next president, and I'll repeat it. I'm going to
be the next president of the United States,'' he declared.
   ``It's a national victory, not a victory so much for me
personally as for the themes we've been discussing.''
   Bush said he would continue to hammer away at his basic themes
of balancing the budget without raising taxes, ``make progress
toward peace through strength ... and reducing the threat of war.''
   ``This is a big, a major political victory,'' he said. ``My
message is going to continue to be one of hope. America's best
days, I am convinced, lie ahead.''

   March 2
   Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald on the United States and Panama:
   The United States finds itself powerless to do anything about
yet another irritant in Central America.
   The irritant is Manuel (Antonio) Noriega, the National Guard
general and dictator in Panama. ...
   The U.S. government is pussyfooting around partly because it
used to rely on Noriega for occasional help and partly because it
doesn't know what to do. ...
   Many Latin Americans regard the United States as an
imperialistic power, but in fact we can't seem to get rid of a
tinpot dictator who gets rich by funneling narcotics to shiftless
American youth. Some imperialism!

   Lubbock (Texas) Avalanche-Journal on the United States and
Nicaragua:
   The muddled U.S. policy in Central America became even more so
over the weekend as experts pondered the House defeat of
``humanitarian'' aid for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   As a result, not only is the fate of the Nicaraguan rebels
fighting to overturn the Marxist Sandinista regime in jeopardy, but
U.S. policy in the region remains one of vacillation and weakness _
the result of unbelievable on-again, off-again meddling by Congress.
   With no immediate aid in the pipeline, the fate of the Contras
is now in limbo.
   The White House, Congress, the media and the American people can
be faulted for not coming to grips with the issue of what to do
about Soviet expansion into this hemisphere.
   The problem is the same as it has been all along _ fear of
becoming involved in another guerrilla-type war and guilt for not
being able to deal with Third World problems which have no easy
solutions.
   Great nations do not let themselves become enmeshed in such
fuzzy thinking.

   The Tennessean, Nashville, Tenn., on Barry Goldwater on Evan
Mecham:
   One thing you have to say for Barry Goldwater, former Arizona
senator: He expresses his opinions forcefully and pulls no punches.
   Another thing you have to say for him: He can admit a mistake.
   Goldwater now says he was mistaken to support the election in
1986 of (Arizona) Gov. Evan Mecham, who is undergoing an
impeachment trial and faces a recall election in May.
   The arch-conservative Goldwater said Mecham should go back to
the job he had before becoming governor _ selling cars. But he
acknowledges that Mecham may not listen to reason.
   ``He is a very obstinate man,'' Goldwater said of Mecham. ``I
used to drive mules and he's a lot like a mule.''
   Goldwater not only expresses opinions forcefully, he tells the
truth.
   Mecham, indeed, resembles a stubborn mule. But with Goldwater's
help, perhaps the state of Arizona won't have to put up with the
errant and arrogant governor too much longer.

   The Press, Atlantic City, N.J., on the war against drugs:
   ``Just say no.''
   That's what the Reagans have been saying to people who use
drugs. It's not that simple. For thousands of addicts, going
straight is difficult; many need help, but as a result of budget
cuts, the help is often nowhere to be found.
   It should be easy, though, for the president to cut off all
foreign aid and impose severe sanctions against those countries
doing little, if anything, to stop the flow of drugs into this
country.
   The penalties can range from a loss of foreign aid to a 50
percent tax on imports.
   According to congressional reports, wholesale corruption in
Mexico has made that country ``the portal through which flows
one-third of all the marijuana, heroin and cocaine on America's
streets and schoolyards.''
   Yet the administration declined to decertify Mexico and other
nations, citing national security problems. ...
   That means the administration places a higher priority on how
anti-Moscow a nation is than it does on how anti-drug it is.

   Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on the Shultz peace mission:
   Secretary of State George Shultz accomplished two things on
(his) peace mission to Syria and Jordan. He spent some of the
taxpayers' money. And he spent some of the taxpayers' money. ...
   The truth is that the Palestinians, though they are falling to
Israeli gunfire at the rate of two or three a day in occupied
towns, see no reason to give up their position at this time. ...
   What the recent skirmishes ... have done is publicize the plight
of the Palestinian refugees, a situation that had existed for so
long that even terrorist acts failed to make it big news. ...
   What the U.S. proposal would do is move the bitter dispute of
Palestinians and Israel to the bargaining table. Such a move would
defuse the explosive situation in the occupied territories, and end
the battle that has been costly in terms of Palestinian lives but a
boon politically.
   If the United States or any other party is going to bring peace
to this troubled land, it will take more than vague promises of
negotiation. Without the ingredients for a real compromise, peace
envoys might as well just stay home.

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on George Shultz:
   The man is aging gracefully, just like his boss. Unlike Ronald
Reagan, though, Secretary of State George P. Shultz skips around
the globe on a monthly basis, handling missions of import with
savvy and vitality.
   Nearing the end of a lengthy and distinguished career in
governmental service, Shultz has not only survived in an
administration that has had constant turnover, he has thrived. He
has emerged as the true superstar of the Reagan years.
   A gentleman in the most complimentary sense, Shultz possesses an
iron will and discipline. He has hung tough with an impeccable
dignity through some trying circumstances, ranging from Lebanon to
Ollie North.
   Though he has been off the mark on occasion, he has never
wavered from what he believes. A man of intense patriotic devotion,
Shultz has been the man that has kept things together for Reagan.
   Unlike his whirling dervish predecessor, Al Haig, Shultz exudes
a calm that has made the difference in various situations. He's
everybody's favorite Uncle George.

   Los Angeles Daily News on alcoholism firings:
   Last Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich ruled
in Tampa, Fla., that the National Marine Fisheries Service's firing
of an alcoholic who missed 14 months of work in a three-year period
constituted unlawful discrimination because the employee was
legally crippled by alcohol.
   Kovachevich's ruling was based on a law that requires federal
agencies to ``make reasonable accommodations'' for handicapped
workers, including alcoholics and drug addicts.
   That law seems part of a trend, one that the U.S. Supreme Court
will fortunately have an opportunity to stop this summer when it
rules on another case. That case involves two veterans who claim
that alcoholism prevented them from taking full advantage of
Veterans Administration education benefits during the 10-year limit
following their military discharges. ...
   There is a big difference between people with incurable medical
problems and people who choose not to fight their thirst for
alcohol. ...
   But legally defining alcoholism as a disease would set a
dangerous precedent that conceivably could lead to the
decriminalization of drunken driving (or make it a prosecutable
offense for social drinkers only). This trend could even spawn the
birth of the alcoholic defense, by which those who can blame their
addiction for their transgressions could escape punishment. ...
   There comes a point at which the legal system must assume that
adults are responsible for their behavior, and that line must be
drawn at excessive drinking.

   The Sheboygan (Wis.) Press on how hard Congress works:
   What's this? One of our local congressmen claiming that Congress
doesn't work hard enough?
   What kind of way is that to treat one of your own? Why, the very
thought is almost un-American. It's also a good way for Rep. Thomas
Petri, R-Fond du Lac, to light a fire under his colleagues and then
watch them do a slow burn.
   Petri criticized House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, for
scheduling a ``measly'' 14 legislative working days and calling for
only 10 votes in the first 50 days of 1988. He described it as ``a
stunning absence of congressional activity.''
   That accusation, of course, was enough to send his colleagues
into a tizzy. Before long, several of them were grumbling about how
Petri doesn't know what he's talking about.
   Of course they all work hard, the insulted congressmen said. And
how dare Petri even think of such a thing?
   If Congress is so busy, why do they waste so much time on
foolish proclamations to satisfy their constituents back home and
dream up ways to tack their own pet projects onto bills that have
absolutely nothing to do with each other?
   The only thing Petri is guilty of is calling 'em as he sees 'em.

   Vice President George Bush stood within reach of the Republican
presidential nomination today after a sweep of Super Tuesday
primaries. Democrats Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson split a rich
harvest of delegates with Albert Gore Jr., who declared today
``it's a three-man race'' after thrashing Richard Gephardt in the
South.
   ``It exceeded my fondest expectations,'' exulted Bush as he
surveyed his 16-0 primary shutout Tuesday and looked ahead to an
Illinois showdown next Tuesday, where another victory over Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole would give his nomination an aura of inevitability.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker, himself once a
candidate, said of Bush, ``I think it would take a major event to
deny him the nomination.'' But there was no sign President Reagan
was ready to endorse him or another candidate, he said.
   Super Tuesday spelled disaster for Dole, fellow Republican Pat
Robertson, and Gephardt, all three teetering on the verge of
elimination after rejection in state after state. Robertson did win
the party's caucuses in Washington state on Tuesday.
   Almost certain to pack it in was Republican Jack Kemp, who was
meeting with advisers to see if there was any point in continuing.
Kemp, who got no better than 7 percent of the vote in any of
Tuesday's primaries, scheduled no announcement today about his
plans, but a spokeswoman said he would have a news conference
Thursday.
   In Nashville, Tenn., today, Gore dismissed the chances of
Gephardt. ``It's a three-man race, no question about it,'' Gore
said on NBC-TV. The Tennessee senator, who won his own state and
four other Southern primaries, said ``all three of us are going all
the way to California and probably to the convention.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, who won the two biggest Southern
states, Florida and Texas, made television appearances from
Chicago, where he was already campaigning.
   ``I've always felt that ... this will go right down to the last
primaries in California and New Jersey,'' he said on CBS-TV.
   Jackson, who won in five Southern states, said at a Houston news
conference today his results show he is a serious contender.
   ``In these elections we are removing those doubts. ... Our
coalition represents the future of the Democratic Party,'' he said.
   Robertson, at a news conference in Atlanta today, said, ``None
of us could have dreamed that he (Bush) could be so strong. The
mantle of Ronald Reagan has passed to George Bush.''
   But, he said, ``It isn't over yet. ... Still half of the
delegates are to be selected.''
   Robertson had hoped to do well in the South but won only the
Washington caucuses, which represent an early stage in that state's
delegate selection. Still, he said he believed he was ``making a
profound change in American politics'' and he planned to continue
his cause beyond this year's election.
   Dole acknowledged he took a whipping. Campaigning today in
Chicago, he said, ``It will be up to Illinois now to turn it
around.''
   The delegate total dramatically spelled out how Bush dominated
the day.
   With 712 Republican convention delegates at stake, Bush won 578,
giving him 705 when combined with the delegates he won in earlier
contests. Dole had 98, for a total of 163. Robertson gained 9
delegates for a total of 17. Kemp picked up four for a total of 39.
The remainder will be apportioned as the final few votes are
counted.
   It takes 1,139 to gain the Republican nomination at the party
convention in New Orleans in August.
   On the Democratic side, with 1,307 national convention delegates
at stake in 21 contests, the race looked like this:
   Dukakis won 386 for a total of 455.5; Jackson picked up 366,
giving him a total of 393.55; and Gore took 326 for a total of
347.8. Gephardt picked up 93 delegates for a total of 143, while
Gary Hart failed to pick up a delegate.
   It takes 2,082 to gain the Democratic nomination at the party
convention in Atlanta this summer.
   Super Tuesday was designed by Southern Democrats hoping for a
more conservative candidate that they believed could avoid the
disasters which have befallen the Democrats in four of the last
five presidential elections.
   But the massive schedule _ 20 Democratic and 17 Republican
contests _ appeared to offer an advantage to the best financed
candidates or, in the case of Jackson, the one who had the most
solid base in the region.
   While Jackson was far outspent by his rivals, he received more
than 90 percent of the black vote in the South, according to exit
polls, which said he won as much as 10 percent of the white vote _
more than twice as much as his 1984 showing among whites.
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, the popular vote from
the Democratic primaries was Jackson 2,493,700, Dukakis 2,439,856,
Gore 2,431,306, Gephardt 1,204,585, Hart 276,594, and Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon 179,580.
   With 93 percent of the Republican precincts reporting, the
totals were Bush 2,584,238, Dole 1,095,419, Robertson 582,730, and
Kemp 218,136.
   While Bush towered over his Republican rivals after the biggest
day in primary election history, the Democrats still were a party
in search of a clear leader.
   Super Tuesday gave them three and left Gephardt on shaky ground.
Democrats will hold caucuses on Saturday in South Carolina, where
Gephardt, Jackson and Gore are the principal contenders, and then
move on to Illinois for next Tuesday's primary.
   Gephardt, already hurting for money, said he will concentrate
scarce resources on Michigan rather than Illinois, where favorite
son Simon is making a last stand. Michigan's Democratic caucuses
will take place March 26.
   ``I never told you it was going to be easy,'' Gephardt told
supporters in St. Louis. He said the 20-state Super Tuesday
landscape was just too broad for his financially pressed campaign.
   Robertson's political base among fundamentalist Christians was
simply too narrow, and he failed once again to win a primary. Even
in his home state of Virginia, he finished third.
   Dukakis proved he could attract Southern votes with victories in
Texas and Florida to add to majorities in Rhode Island, Maryland
and his home state of Massachusetts. He also was an easy winner in
Idaho's Democratic caucuses, and topped the field in Hawaii's
caucuses also.
   Jackson carried Alabama, Georgia, Lousiana, Mississippi and
Virginia.
   Gore, the Tennessee senator who gambled all on a Southern
strategy, came out a winner though he still needs to prove his
appeal north of the Mason-Dixon Line. Gore carried Arkansas,
Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee and was leading in
Nevada.

   The St. Paul Pioneer Press & Dispatch's
drama critic said today that he has resigned because he plagiarized
portions of a review from a review published six years ago in the
New York Times.
   In his final column, David Hawley said that in preparing to
write his Feb. 14 review of ``Good,'' a play by C.P. Taylor, he
studied articles and reviews written when the play was performed
elsewhere.
   ``My own piece contained material from a review by Frank Rich
printed Oct. 14, 1982, in the New York Times,'' wrote Hawley, who
brought the problem to the attention of his editors himself and
said he will remain at the paper in another capacity.
   ``Although I did not have the original notice before me at the
time I was writing, my reference notes _ by then `commingled' with
notes taken during the performance _ were so detailed that I
duplicated both the general structure of the original piece and
many key phrases.
   ``It constituted blatant plagiarism, though I managed to ignore
that fact while I was writing my review and after I had written
it,'' Hawley wrote in the column published today. ``I convinced
myself that my reasoning was original enough to be my own and that
my words, too, were my own.''
   Hawley, the St. Paul paper's drama critic for 9{ years, said the
plagiarism was discovered by a reader, who sent him a personal
letter.
   ``My reaction was first surprise, then shock, then humiliation.
Clearly, I have forfeited any right to work as a drama critic,''
Hawley said.
   Hawley said his resignation as a drama critic was accepted on
Friday.
   ``Plagiarism is one of the most serious of all journalistic sins
and cannot be tolerated,'' Editor Deborah Howell said in a notice
to readers printed with Hawley's column.
   ``Yet, it is to his credit that he brought the case to his
editors' attention and offered his resignation at the same time,''
Howell said.
   ``I would like to assure readers that while we have compassion
for a fellow human being's mistake, it does not lessen our
commitment to high standards of critical journalism.''
   In his column, Hawley wrote, ``By not firing me outright, they
have generously given me the opportunity to redeem myself in some
other capacity.''

   St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch on the Noriega regime:
   It is time for the United States to turn the economic screws as
tight as possible on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and his henchmen.
That may be the only way to get them to relinquish their grip on
Panama.
   The State Department is preparing to notify U.S. banks that hold
Panamanian deposits not to engage in any transactions with the
Noriega regime. (Deposed president Eric Arturo) Delvalle's lawyers
also have started lawsuits to block any transfer of funds.
   The United States should refuse to hand over the $8 million
payment of canal revenues due Panama next month. That is part of
the $80 million in revenues for this year.
   The United States also should consider a trade embargo and a ban
against flights into the United States of Air Panama _ which also
might cut down the drug traffic _ and termination of any
humanitarian aid to Panama.
   Applying all available drastic economic pressure now may be the
only way to topple the Noriega regime without widespread bloodshed.

   Providence (R.I.) Journal on aid to the Contras:
   On Thursday (March 3), the House of Representatives defeated yet
another proposal to aid the contra rebels in Nicaragua. The vote
leaves the resistance stranded with no American aid whatsoever.
   The issue of peace and freedom in Central America is too
important to lay to rest. President Reagan can be counted on to
press Congress for a new vote on aid. ... But he must act swiftly.
...
   When the tally was complete, it was applauded by Reagan, but
regretted by Speaker (James) Wright _ even though the president
supports the Contras and the speaker opposes them. This ... may
possibly be explained by the cynical purpose of the measure itself.
   The real intent was not to aid the Contras but protect their
opponents on Capitol Hill.
   Reagan wants to give Congress one more chance. ... If Speaker
Wright blocks this effort ... his Democratic colleagues will need
more than a fig leaf to hide behind in November.

   If you've been putting off doing your 1987 taxes, here's a
chilling thought: Money magazine reports it asked 50 tax preparers

   Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office has told Congress that
the Internal Revenue Service is giving incorrect answers to 39
percent of the questions posed by people who call for help with
their tax returns.
   No matter how complex the law, those who turn to the IRS for
help are entitled to a straight answer, and Congress should make it

a police spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the blasts occurred just before 4 a.m. on a
street that runs past one side of the national police station.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police
suspected the small, radical nationalist group, the Guerrilla Army
of the Free Galician People, which seeks independence from Spain
for the four-province northwestern region of Galicia.
   In the past two years, the group has claimed responsibility for
setting off several small, homemade bombs against utilities, public

   The Senegalese Press Agency did not give the specific charges. A

   Among those charged was Abdoulaye Wade, leader of the opposition
Senegalese Democratic Party, who was President Abdou Diouf's
strongest opponent in the Feb. 28 elections.
   Diouf won re-election with 73 percent of the vote, while Wade
received 25 percent. The announcement of preliminary results
declaring Diouf the victor sparked several days of street riots.
   A state of emergency was declared, a curfew put into effect, and
riot and police and army troops were called out to restore order.
Several opposition leaders were blamed for inciting the

   Rep. Wayne Dowdy called for party unity
Wednesday to help him keep John Stennis' Senate seat in Democratic
hands, while a supporter of Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said he was ``the
big winner'' despite his second-place finish behind Jesse Jackson.
   Dowdy defeated Secretary of State Dick Moplus by a 54 percent to
42 percent margin Tuesday to grab the Democratic nomination for the
seat of the retiring Stennis. Rep. Trent Lott, who became the
state's first GOP congressmen since Reconstruction when he first
won election in 1972, was unopposed.
   ``We're not running against anybody,'' said Lott, who said he'd
based his campaign on issues. ``Our strategy until November is to
run a continous campaign and to work hard and aggressively all over
the state.''
   ``It will take a united Democratic Party to beat him,'' Dowdy
said. ``It can be won, and things are ripe for the Democrats to win
in November. Mississippi should have at least one Democrat in the
U.S. Senate.''
   GOP Sen. Thad Cochran holds the state's other seat.
   In the Democratic presidential primary, with 99 percent of
precincts reporting, Jackson had 157,523 or 44 percent, Gore had
120,049 or 34 percent and trailing far behind were Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis with 29,789 or 8 percent; Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt with 19,646 votes or 6 percent; and former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart with 13,439 votes or 4 percent.
   ``We're pleased. We were the big winner'' said Gore state
coordinator Brad Chism. ``We came away with a lot more than people
thought we would.''
   Jackson was leading for 24 delegates, Gore for 15 and Dukakis
for one.
   In the Republican race, with 2,298 of 2,340 precincts or 98
percent reporting, Vice President George Bush had 103,498 votes or
66 percent to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole's 26,212 or 17 percent. Former
TV evangelist Pat Robertson had 21,291 or 14 percent, and New York
Rep. Jack Kemp had 5,699 or 4 percent.
   Bush picked up 27 GOP delegates, with two each going to Dole and
Robertson.

   Population growth puts pressure on the
environment and resources, whether it occurs in the Third World or
the United States, a population group says in a new booklet.
   ``USA by Numbers: A Statistical Portrait of the United States,''
was issued Wednesday by Zero Population Growth to show how
increasing numbers of people affect the nation's environment,
economy and society as a whole.
   ``Although Americans are increasingly aware of population
pressures in other parts of the world, many of us do not recognize
the symptoms of overpopulation when we find them in our own
backyards,'' said Susan Weber, executive director of the non-profit
population group.
   The group has compiled statistics from a variety of sources,
many of which also appear in the massive Statistical Abstract of
the United States issued annually by the Commerce Department.
   The new 164-page volume, however, concentrates on the
relationship between population and the quality of life in the
nation.
   Chapters in the volume look at population growth over time, city
and rural relationships, young and old, fertility and health,
sexuality and abortion, unemployment, poverty, water use,
pollution, land use and habitat.
   The paperback volume costs $8.95 plus $1.50 for shipping and
handling and can be purchased from Zero Population Growth, 1601
Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C., 20009.

   Fire swept through an apartment building
housing mental patients, killing a 64-year-old woman and seriously
injuring four other people, firefighters said.
   The fire, possibly originating in a stove, broke out in a

1975 under a reform providing their treatment outside hospitals.
   The dead woman was identified as Maria Svagel, who was trapped

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old youth charged with murdering
a classmate with a baseball bat for the thrill of it was a confused
youth whose cries for help were ignored, the defense argued in
closing arguments today.
   Defense attorney John Philip White, who urged the jury to
deliver a verdict of innocent by reason of insanity, characterized
Rod Matthews as having a ``diseased intellect'' that made him
unable to act rationally.
   White also said that the Canton youth's attempts to seek help
from teachers prior to the Nov. 20, 1986 slaying were ignored.
   Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Peter Casey said the
defense's contention that Ritalin adversely affected Matthews was a
``smoke screen.'' He argued that Mathews, who is being tried as an
adult, was a calculating murderer.
   Casey noted testimony from several medical experts that Ritalin
does not permanently alter behavior or trigger violence or
hallucinations in normal doses.
   Matthews, whose eyes were downcast during two hours of closing
arguments on the seventh day of the trial, admitted to bludgeoning
14-year-old Shaun Ouillette of Canton with a baseball bat in a
wooded section of the community south of Boston.
   White depicted Matthews as a highly unstable youth whose use of
the drug Ritalin to control hyperactivity may have contributed to
his violent behavior.
   ``He was working in his own world,'' said White.
   The judge gave final instructions to the jury and said
deliberations would begin in the afternoon.
   A local cable access station has run the trial unedited,
including dramatic testimony by classmates that Matthews plotted
the murder for a month and calmly showed them the body as it lay
for weeks in snow-covered woods.
   ``Nothing has impacted the community more than this case,''
Canton Cable General Manager Tanya Willow said. ``It's what
everyone talks about. It's such a tragedy.''
   Defense experts maintained and prosecution witnesses contested
that Matthews, who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, had
emotional problems worsened by his use of the prescription drug
Ritalin.
   Coincidentally, Ouillette's mother, Jeanne Quinn, testified that
her son took Ritalin from age 7 through 11 to successfully control
frantic behavior that plagued his childhood.
   Dr. Michael Annunziata, a court-appointed psychiatrist,
testified Tuesday that Matthews suffered from a ``conduct
disorder'' but had not experienced classic symptoms of psychosis,
such as hallucinations.
   Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne, a neurologist at the Eunice Shriver
Center in Waltham, testified that standard doses of Ritalin should
not trigger violent behavior.
   Under cross-examination by the defense, Kinsbourne said the drug
could not totally eliminate Matthews' volatile behavior.
   Dr. Bernard Yudowitz of Belmont's McLean Hospital testified
Monday that Ritalin may have made it harder for Matthews to control
his behavior.
   Matthews said he had plotted the slaying for a month to
experience what killing someone was like, according to testimony
from two classmates. Ouillette's body was discovered in December
1986 after one of the classmates sent an anonymous letter to police.
   Matthews has been held at a Danvers children's facility since
last year.
   The case has been compared to the trial of Anthony Broussard,
18, sentenced to 25 years to life Dec. 3, 1982, in San Jose,
Calif., for killing his girlfriend in 1981. Broussard, who was
tried as an adult, took at least 13 schoolmates to see the victim's
body.

   Here, at a glance, are results from the Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALABAMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson had expected to win comfortably on the strength of
a sizable black vote, but instead narrowly defeated Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., who was endorsed by Sen. Howell Heflin. Vice
President George Bush swamped Kansas Sen. Bob Dole just as expected.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AMERICAN SAMOA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats in the South Pacific territory, smallest of Super
Tuesday's players, chose one national convention delegate for
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, one for Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, and one uncommitted. Only 36 people voted at party
caucuses.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARKANSAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore won with 37 percent, Dukakis had 19 percent and Jackson had
17 percent. Gov. Bill Clinton said Gore benefited from undecided
voters, and the big surprise was the fourth place, 12 percent
showing of Gephardt. Bush won with nearly half the vote.
   Rep. Bill Alexander won an 11th term, defeating political
consultant Darrell Glascock by 2-1 in the Democratic primary.
Alexander is unopposed in the general election.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FLORIDA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis found a warm reception from transplanted Northerners and
pulled in 41 percent of the vote to Jackson's 20 percent. Bush took
advantage of President Reagan's popularity, Gov. Bob Martinez'
endorsement and family ties (his son Jeb is secretary of commerce)
to trounce Dole nearly 3-1.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson won by piling up margins of better than 8-1 over Gore
and Dukakis in the 5th Congressional District, composed largely of
the city of Atlanta. The heavy black vote outweighed Gore's
endorsements by Sen. Sam Nunn and Gov. Joe Frank Harris. Bush beat
Dole better than 2-1.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HAWAII</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Endorsements by the state's top Democrats were credited with
helping Dukakis defeat Jackson at Hawaii's Democratic Party
caucuses by nearly a 3-2 margin. Gov. John Waihee, who backed
Dukakis, said he wasn't surprised by Jackson's strong showing and
called it ``healthy for the Democratic Party.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IDAHO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis captured 8 of 18 uncommitted delegates, with Jackson
winning 4 and 6 going to the state convention uncommitted. Gov.
Cecil Andrus, who says he will go to the convention uncommitted,
said the turning point in the Dukakis campaign was a last-minute
visit to Boise last weekend. Jackson's strong showing was a
surprise because the state has a minority population of less than 5
percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>KENTUCKY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore won his neighboring state with help from Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson, gaining 46 percent of the vote to Dukakis' 19 percent.
Bush's 59 percent vote was termed ``astounding'' by his state
campaign chairman, Rep. Harold ``Hal'' Rogers, who had predicted a
48 percent victory.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LOUISIANA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson outpolled Gore 35 percent to 28 percent despite Gore's
endorsement by Democratic Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer. Bush breezed to
victory with 58 percent, leaving Dole and Roberston each with 18
percent.
   In the 4th Congressional District race to replace Roemer, his
former congressional aide Jim McCrery, a Republican, and Democratic
state Sen. Foster Campbell claimed spots in an April 16 runoff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MARYLAND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson finished second to Dukakis, 29 percent to 46 percent,
with a strong showing in the two predominantly black congressional
districts. Bush carried all eight districts even though he didn't
campaign personally in Maryland, while Dole did spend some time in
the state. Bush led 53 percent to 32 percent.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes easily won nomination for a third
term and will be opposed by millionaire businessman Thomas Blair, a
newcomer to politics.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MASSACHUSETTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis' home state gave him 59 percent of the vote. Jackson was
second with 19 percent. The win at home and victories in Florida
and Texas gave Dukakis the three biggest Super Tuesday prizes.
Bush, who was born in Massachusetts, got 59 percent of the vote to
Dole's 26 percent. Gordon Nelson, state co-chairman for New York
Rep. Jack Kemp's campaign, said Bush convinced voters he was
Reagan's logical successor: ``George Bush won because he is Reagan
II.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MISSISSIPPI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush and Jackson rang up big victories, with Jackson helped by
turnout in the heavily black Delta that enabled him to defeat Gore.
   In a Democratic primary for the seat of retiring Sen. John
Stennis, voters chose Rep. Wayne Dowdy to oppose GOP Rep. Trent
Lott in November.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MISSOURI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush won a narrow victory in Dole's backyard, getting 42 percent
of the vote to Dole's 41 percent. Bush pulled ahead with returns
from St. Louis County. Gephardt easily won his home state with 58
percent of the vote, but it was his only victory Tuesday. Jackson
was second with 20 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEVADA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore won in a tally at Nevada's Democratic caucuses, with
Dukakis second and Jackson a surprisingly strong third. In
balloting for county convention delegates, Gore, who got support
from Sen. Harry Reid and other top state Democrats, had 33 percent
to Dukakis' 26 and Jackson's 22. Party chairman Beecher Avants said
Jackson's strong showing ``was a real surprise.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NORTH CAROLINA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dole lost his wife's home state as Bush emphasized his ties to
President Reagan. Bush had 45 percent to Dole's 40 percent of the
GOP vote. Endorsements from such key Democrats as Sen. Terry
Sanford and former Gov. Jim Hunt helped Gore squeeze past Jackson
35 percent to 33 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OKLAHOMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore got 41 percent of the vote, almost double his nearest
competitor, Gephardt. Gore's victory margin was a surprise because
a recent poll showed him in a tie with Gephardt and Dukakis. But he
visited the state several times and spent more on advertising than
any other Democrat. As expected, the GOP contest was close, with
Bush capturing 37 percent of the vote and Dole 35 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RHODE ISLAND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush and Dukakis continued their New England sweeps, with the
vice president winning 65 percent of the GOP vote and the governor
from neighboring Massachusetts getting nearly 70 percent of the
Democratic vote. Bush had built up good will through previous
campaign journeys on behalf of Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and Rep.
Claudine Schneider.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TENNESSEE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore's home state gave him about 72 percent of the vote, leaving
Jackson, with 21 percent, a distant second. Bush trounced Dole
nearly 3-1.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TEXAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis won the top delegate state with 33 percent of the vote.
Bush, who built an oil business in Texas, crushed all his rivals,
receiving 64 percent of the vote. Robertson got 15 percent and Dole
14 percent.
   Democratic U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen easily won renomination for a
fourth term. Rep. Beau Boulter and Wes Gilbreath, a Houston
investor, advance to GOP runoff for U.S. Senate. The winner faces
Bentsen in November.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VIRGINIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson received 45 percent of the vote, with Gore far behind at
23 percent and Dukakis with 22 percent. Jackson got strong support
in Hampton Roads and the Richmond area, overcoming Gore's numbers
in southwestern Virginia and Dukakis' power base in suburbs near
Washington, D.C. Boyd Marcus, Bush's state coordinator, said he
would have been pleased with a mid-40 percent showing. The 2-to-1
win over Dole (53 percent to 25 percent) ``has been the most
surprising thing,'' he said. Virginia native Robertson had 12
percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Robertson's 39 percent of the vote gave him his only victory of
Super Tuesday. Dole had 26 percent, and Bush was third, his only
loss of the night, with 24 percent. To claim their share of the
state's 41 GOP delegates, the candidates will have to fare as well
in this spring's county or legislative district caucuses, which
precede the July 15 state convention where delegates will be
allocated. Dukakis, endorsed by Gov. Booth Gardner, led Democrats
with 45 percent, followed by Jackson with 32 percent. The
Democrats' tally won't be completed for a week.

<HEAD>Gov't, Citing Winnie the Pooh, Asks Bureaucrats to Use Plain
English</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's army of civil servants got new marching
orders Wednesday: use plain English.
   Citing such authorities as Confucius and Winnie the Pooh, a
Cabinet Office pamphlet appealed to the bureaucrats to be clear and
concise in talking to the public and to each other.
   Britain's 500,000-member civil service has never been known for
using a word when three would do, as the pamphlet notes in citing
this 18th-century note from the Commissioners of Excise to the
Supervisor of Pontefract:
   ``I am ordered to acquaint you that if you hereafter continue
that affected and schoolboy way of writing, and to murder the
language in such a manner, you will be discharged for a fool.''
   The Duke of Wellington railed against official jargon as ``the
futile driveling of mere quill-driving.''
   Some of the examples given as good writing would make those
quill-drivers blanch. It quoted this note from a minister in
ancient Egypt to a senior civil servant:
   ``Apollonius to Zeno, greeting. You did right to send the
chickpeas to Memphis. Farewell.''
   The pamphlet was written by John Wright, head of information at
the Cabinet Office. The introduction is by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who likes to be thought of as the enemy of verbose
bureaucrats.
   ``She's a very great friend of the plain English campaign and
extremely keen on the civil service using plain English,'' said
Wright. ``She is a plain-speaking woman.''
   Mrs. Thatcher writes: ``Too often clarity and simplicity are
overwhelmed by pompous words, long sentences and endless
paragraphs.''
   Or as the book of Ecclesiastes admonishes: ``Let thy speech be
short, comprehending much in few words.''
   Among the tips in the pamphlet:
   _ ``Use shorter words. Write `try' for `attempt,' `about' for
`concerning,' `more' for `additional.' Long words are often a sign
of a stodgy style that sends readers to sleep.''
   _ ``Use short sentences. Aim at an average of 15-20 words _ even
shorter if you can manage it. You can still be polite and, if need
be, formal or forceful.''
   _ ``Use jargon and abbreviations only when you're sure the
reader knows what they mean. Otherwise explain them.''
   It suggests sentences with active verbs, such as ``the
department decided that employees should work from 9 to 5'' instead
of ``the decision of the department was that employees should work
between 9 and 5.''
   Or as Confucius would say: ``If language is not correct, then
what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is
meant, then what ought to be done remains undone.''
   ``Remember,'' says the pamphlet, ``readers are in a hurry to get
to the point. They don't want to be stuck in a verbal traffic jam.''
   Wright told The Associated Press the problem has been clearing
up in recent years. ``There's increasing use of crisp and direct
language. There's a great deal of plain English around.''
   That would please Winnie the Pooh, that bear of little brain who
signs off the pamphlet: ``Long words bother me.''

   Several people hospitalized after a speeding bus
rolled off a mountain road have died, raising the death toll in the
accident to 42, it was reported Wednesday.
   The reports on China's evening news broadcasts said 33 of the 71
passengers were killed in the crash and nine others died from their
injuries during hospital treatment.
   The bus reportedly was traveling too fast as it headed down a
curved mountain road in Henan province. The driver hit the brakes
and the vehicle swerved off the road, plunging 371 feet into a
ravine.
   The bus accident was the third biggest transportation disaster
of the year. A plane crash in southwest China killed 108 and a
train derailment in southern China claimed 88 lives, both in
January.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan government today rejected Washington's
demand that a simultaneous cessation of U.S. and Soviet military
aid be part of an Afghan peace settlement.
   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said Soviet assistance
cannot be compared to U.S. aid for ``terrorist groups,'' a
reference to guerrillas fighting the Kabul government.
   ``Afganistan has always received Soviet assistance and will
continue to receive it even after the withdrawal of the Soviet
troops,'' he said. He did not specify what kind of aid he was
talking about.
   Wakil charged that the United States was trying to introduce a
new issue just as the nearly 6-year-old Afghanistan peace talks
appeared to be close to conclusion.
   The same approach, he said, was used by Pakistan when it
insisted that formation of an interim government to replace the
current Kabul government be linked to an agreement to withdraw
Soviet troops.
   Asked whether these two points could produce a deadlock, he
responded, ``Don't you think so?''
   Wakil told reporters the latest round of U.N.-mediated talks had
produced ``nothing important,'' since agreement was reached last
week on the timetable for withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet
troops in Afghanistan.
   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to back
Kabul in a war that has waged for nine years.
   Wakil accused Pakistan, which represents the guerrillas in the
talks, of resorting to ``maneuvers to push the Geneva negotiations
toward stalemate.''
   But he said the Afghan side was determined to push for a speedy
conclusion.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said Moscow will bring
home its troops starting May 15 if a peace package is signed by
next Tuesday.
   Asked whether Afghanistan was prepared to continue negotiations
if that target date was not met, Wakil said, ``Regardless of
whatever new obstacles the Pakistanis are going to create, we are
determined to move seriously toward the finalization of the
agreements.''
   Wakil's comments contrasted with the cautious confidence
displayed earlier this week by U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez and the
chief Pakistani representative, acting Foreign Minister Zain
Noorani.
   Cordovez spoke Tuesday of ``substantive'' progress in readying
the documents which make up the settlement.
   Sources close to the Pakistani delegation said Noorani was
hopeful that some deal could be struck on the issue of the interim
government, perhaps by a compromise on the timing of its formation.
   For the fourth straight day, the separate meetings Cordovez had
with the Pakistani and Afghan delegations were confined to the
morning. Cordovez earlier told journalists that no spectacular
developments were expectable to emerge from the talks before next
week.

<TEXT>
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy
headed for Moscow today to brief Kremlin leaders on U.S. efforts to
bring about Mideast peace talks, the State Department said.
   Murphy will brief Soviet Foreign Minister Edouard Shevardnadze
on the latest U.S. efforts in advance of Shevardnadze's visit to
Washington later this month, said spokesman Charles Redman.
   Secretary of State George Shultz promised to keep the Soviets
updated about his Mideast plans when he conducted a shuttle mission
in the region last week. Shultz personally briefed the Soviets on
the initial phase of his mission when he stopped in Moscow last
month.
   Shultz is seeking to bring Israel and the Arabs to the
negotiating table for talks on Palestinian autonomy starting May 1.
Under the plan Shultz presented to Israeli, Jordanian and Egyptian
leaders, the talks would be launched in an international forum that
would include the participation of the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, England and France.
   Shultz, who initially rejected Soviet involvement in the
process, now views the Kremlin's involvement as necessary to nudge
along the reluctant Arabs who are Moscow's allies. Shultz has asked
both Israel and Jordan for responses to his proposals by next week.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has balked at bringing the
U.S. plan up for a cabinet debate, and intends instead to present a
plan of his own when he comes here next week. That plan calls for
joint U.S.-Soviet participation in autonomy talks for the 1.5
million Palestinians under Israeli occupation.
   Murphy will also stop in Bonn, Rome, Paris and Brussels to bring
officials there up to date on the U.S. Mideast initiative, Redman
said.
   Western European leaders have praised the U.S. involvement,
which is aimed at resolving the three months of Israeli-Palestinian
bloodshed in which at least 80 Arabs have been killed.

office in January 1987 he asked her to keep notes on conversations
with legislators ``so that it might be used against them in the
elections if he chose to use it.''
   She said she did not do so because she thought it would be
improper, and said her job at times was ``like a three-ring
circus.''
   Director of Public Safety Ralph Milstead has accused Mecham of
ordering him not to cooperate with an investigation of the alleged
Nov. 12 threat against Ms. Carlson by Lee Watkins, former head of
state prison construction.
   At the time, Ms. Carlson had resigned from the governor's staff
and was about to testify before a state grand jury that was
investigating Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the
alleged death threat.
   Watkins refused to testify last week, citing his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination, but has previously denied
threatening Ms. Carlson's life.
   Ms. Carlson spoke softly today as she described how Milstead
told her on Nov. 14 that Watkins had threatened her.
   Ms. Carlson testified that Milstead telephoned and ``told me
that there had been a threat made against me by Lee Watkins ... and
it was something to the effect that if I didn't stop talking I
would end up in the bottom of a river.''
   ``I didn't say anything; I was taken aback,'' she said. ``It's
kind of a shock.''
   Ms. Carlson testified that she was upset and called a newspaper
reporter and told him about the alleged threat after a friend
advised her that the best thing for her safety might be to make the
matter public.
   Ms. Carlson said she had previously expressed doubts about
Watkins to both Mecham and then-chief of staff Jim Colter when she
learned that Watkins had a criminal record.
   She said Colter told her, ``We have to take care of Lee. He
raised a lot of money for the campaign.''
   On Tuesday Watkins' attorney, Dale Anderson, testified that a
top Mecham aide helped craft a lie-detector test so Watkins could
pass it.
   Also Tuesday, Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank X.
Gordon Jr., presiding over the Senate trial, decided to bar further
testimony challenging Milstead's credibility.
   Mecham appointed Max Hawkins, then director of the state
Department of Administration and Watkins' boss, to investigate the
alleged death threat.
   Anderson testified that after his client failed four polygraphs,
Hawkins suggested having the polygraph operator ``figure out what
kind of questions could be asked so my client could answer these
questions and get his job back.''
   Anderson said it was not unusual to choreograph a lie detector
test.
   ``You shop for polygraphers and you shop for questions,'' he
said.
   The trial was scheduled to continue today with testimony from
Donna Carlson, target of the alleged threat. At the time, Ms.
Carlson was preparing to testify before the state grand jury about
Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Prosecutor Paul Eckstein said the polygrapher, Manuel
Valenzuela, also may be called to testify before the prosecution
closes its case on the first of three charges against the
first-term Republican governor.
   In addition to the alleged death threat and loan matters, Mecham
is accused of misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by
loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Watkins was placed on administrative leave last November after
he was accused of telling another state official that if Ms.
Carlson didn't keep her mouth shut about the $350,000 loan she
``could take a long boat ride.''
   A transcript of a tape-recorded Nov. 12 conversation between
Anderson and Hawkins was released Tuesday and quotes Hawkins as
saying he wanted polygraph test results that would allow him to
reinstate Watkins.
   ``I love Lee and I want to save his ass,'' the transcript quotes
Hawkins as saying. ``I believe he is getting railroaded.''
   The transcript quotes Hawkins as suggesting the polygraph
operator ask, ``What did Lee say he said? And then he just writes
that down. ... Then the polygraph (operator) says he (Watkins) made
this statement. Is it true?''
   On Nov. 20, Hawkins announced Watkins would be reinstated but
refused to release the polygraph results. At the time, Hawkins said
he knew little beyond the fact that Anderson told him that Watkins
had passed the test.
   Watkins resigned his state job, and Hawkins was fired last week
by acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat who took over when the
House impeached Mecham on Feb. 5.
   Much of Tuesday's questioning by defense lawyer Fred Craft
centered on use of state vehicles by Milstead, Arizona's
highest-ranking lawman, and his relationship with a woman who
claimed she had an affair with him.
   After Milstead's testimony, Gordon said he would allow no more
testimony about these matters.
   ``You have made your point,'' Gordon told Craft. ``You have
established that Director Milstead had a motive for testifying
against the governor,'' including the knowledge that Mecham wanted
to fire him.
   Under questioning by Craft, Milstead denied paying for the
woman's meals or staying overnight at her home after driving there
in a state vehicle. Prosecutor William French contended the
questioning was ``cross-examination by innuendo'' and was improper.
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades
and the first ever in Arizona. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member
Senate is required to remove him, and lawmakers also could vote to
bar him from future public office.
   Mecham also faces a March 22 criminal trial on charges of
concealing the $350,000 loan and a May 17 recall election.

   A convicted rapist who was placed on the U.S.
Marshal Service's 15 most wanted list after twice escaping from
county jails was recaptured after seven months on the run,
authorities said.
   Garnett R. Leacock, 38, offered no resistance when marshals
acting on a tip arrested him Tuesday at a Brooklyn apartment, said
Frank Peo, marshal for the northern district of New York.
   Leacock escaped Aug. 9 from the Montgomery County Jail in Fonda,
where he was awaiting sentencing in the rape of a 16-year-old girl
at his home at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, authorities said.
He was sentenced in abstentia to 27 years.
   In July, Leacock escaped from the Madison County Jail by digging
a hole in the wall of his cell and slipping through after lathering
his body with shampoo. He was recaptured two days later after his
wife, who aided in both escapes, turned him in after having second
thoughts, authorities said.
   Air Force Sgt. Deborah Leacock is serving a five-year sentence
for her role in the second escape.

Strength</HEAD>

   Republicans claimed victory in Georgia Wednesday
after almost twice as many people voted in the party's presidential
primary as ever before, boosting Vice President George Bush's
campaign.
   Democrats, meanwhile, picked Jesse Jackson, with Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. a surprisingly strong second.
   Secretary of State Max Cleland said the 39 percent turnout _ a
presidential primary record _ helped Bush and Gore, who were
preceived as the moderate candidates.
   With 99 percent of the ballots counted, Bush led with 214,892
votes, or 54 percent, giving him all 48 delegates to the August GOP
nominating convention in New Orleans.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas trailed with 94,121 for 24 percent.
Former television evangelist Pat Robertson had 64,995, 16 percent,
and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York had 23,459, or 6 percent.
   In the Democratic race, Jackson had 247,317 votes, or 40
percent. His plurality victories in two congressional districts,
plus his statewide lead, put him ahead for 37 delegates to the
Atlanta convention in July.
   Gore parlayed endorsements by several top state Democrats,
including Sen. Sam Nunn, into 200,758 votes, or 32 percent, good
for 30 delegates. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was a distant
third with 96,881, 16 percent, and received 10 delegates.
   With almost 400,000 ballots cast in the GOP primary, the party
doubled the turnout of 1980, when President Reagan blasted Bush on
the way to nomination.
   Longtime GOP activist Bob Bell, currently chairman emeritus of
the state party, was buoyed by the turnout, claiming it represented
a solidifying of the party in the state.
   Although he agreed that newly active Robertson supporters were
responsible for some of the increase, he said most of the new
voters were oldtime Democrats who ``couldn't find anything in the
Democratic Party to attract their attention, ... so they opted for
Bush.''
   Cleland, a Democrat, agreed with Bell, saying, ``I think it (the
GOP turnout) shows that Georgia is a bonafide two-party state.''

<HEAD>Slot Machine Use by Foreign Soldiers at U.S. Bases Violates Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has improperly allowed foreign
servicemen to play slot machines at its overseas bases in six
countries, violating the host-nation agreements that sanction the
presence of U.S. troops, service auditors have found.
   The Air Force Audit Agency said in a 13-page report such a
permissive attitude violates local laws prohibiting or controlling
gambling in Britain, West Germany, Turkey, the Philippines, Japan
and South Korea.
   The Air Force is allowed to operate slot machines at the
overseas bases for American personnel only, the auditors noted.
   ``Violation of host nation laws or supplement agreements is
potentially embarrassing to the Air Force and could result in
overall prohibition of slot machines in overseas open messes,'' the
auditors added.
   The audit was conducted in the spring of 1987 and the results
forwarded to Air Force officials at that time. The report was
released publicly earlier this week.
   The Air Force said Wednesday it had yet to resolve the issue
because it originally had tried to develop a single policy
directive to govern such situations.
   The foreign laws of the various countries vary to such an
extent, however, that Air Force attorneys are now trying to write a
directive that will allow service officials in each country to
tailor their gambling regulations to local law, said Capt. Lou
Figueroa, an Air Force spokesman.
   ``It is true that we would appear to be in violation in these
six countries,'' Figueroa added.
   ``But I would also point out the Air Force is not aware of any
complaints by any of the host countries. And we do not know the
extent to which foreign nationals are really playing the slots.''
   The Air Force currently operates 2,358 slot machines at 55 base
facilities outside the United States. The machines generated $20.4
million in gross revenue in fiscal 1987. Proceeds from the slots
are designated exclusively for the support of morale, welfare and
recreation programs at the bases.
   The Air Force had allowed gambling at its overseas bases for
years until 1972, when all slot machines were removed amid
disclosures of widespread corruption. The secretary of the Air
Force, after promulgating new, more stringent controls, authorized
their return in March 1982.
   ``We found accounting controls and existing regulatory guidance
generally satisfactory,'' the auditors wrote in their report.
   ``Overall management policies for slot machine maintenance and
personnel administration were effective. Cash and other asset
controls were generally adequate. Our review, however, disclosed
problems associated with legality of slot machine play by citizens
of host countries,'' the report said.
   The auditors said they were recommending more attention be paid
to gambling policies at overseas bases not only because foreign
laws were being ignored, but also because the Air Force was
ignoring what other U.S. military services were doing.
   ``For example, South Korean military personnel are prohibited
from slot machine play in U.S. Army open messes, whereas the Air
Force was in violation of local laws prohibiting gambling,'' the
auditors wrote.

   Gallaudet University, currently embroiled in a
dispute over the selection of its new president, is the only
liberal arts institution in the world for the deaf.
   The 99-acre campus in northeast Washington provides education
for 2,200 university students, 400 high school students and 200
elementary school students. Nearly all the undergraduates are deaf.
   The federally supported institution receives 75 percent of its
$76 million budget from Congress, with the rest coming from
tuition, which is about $6,000 per student.
   The school began in 1856, when Amos Kendall, a wealthy
journalist and former postmaster general opened the Kendall School
for deaf and blind children on his 99-acre farm.
   The following year, Kendall persuaded Congress to incorporate
the school as the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the
Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, with President James Buchanan as its
patron.
   In 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation empowering
the institution to award college degrees through a new National
Deaf Mute College. Edward Miner Gallaudet, son of Thomas Hopkins
Gallaudet, a pioneer in educating the deaf, became its president.
   Five years later, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the diplomas
of the college's first three graduates, starting a tradition that
President Reagan follows today.
   In 1894, the college was renamed in honor of the elder
Gallaudet, and in 1986, Gallaudet College became Gallaudet
University by an act of Congress.
   The institution today has 274 full-time professors, of whom 30
percent are deaf. In addition, 22 percent of the school's
1,300-member support staff are deaf.
   Professors cannot receive tenure unless they demonstrate their
proficiency in sign language to a panel of students and faculty,
and all professors are required to simultaneously speak and sign
their own lectures in English.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Vice President George Bush cashed in on their New England
connections to win Rhode Island's presidential primary.
   Dukakis was a familiar face to Rhode Islanders long before he
began running for president. He campaigned here several times and
quickly gained support from most of Rhode Island's Democratic
hierarchy.
   ``A year ago, no one was going to say that Mike Dukakis would be
the next president,'' Lt. Gov. Richard A. Licht said Tuesday night.
   Dukakis had 34,159 votes or 70 percent; Jesse Jackson had 7,369
votes or 15.2 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 2,013
votes or 4.1 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 1,932
votes or 4 percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 1,392 votes or
2.9 percent.
   Among Republicans, Bush won 10,403 votes or 65 percent; Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole had 3,637 votes or 22.6 percent; former television
evangelist Pat Robertson had 921 votes or 5.8 percent, and New York
Rep. Jack Kemp had 783 votes or 4.9 percent.
   Based on those results, Dukakis likely would capture 19
Democratic delegates and Jackson 3, while Bush would gain 15 GOP
delegates and Dole 6.
   Jackson supporters broke out champagne to celebrate their
candidate's strong showing in a state that is only 2 percent black.
   ``Given $2 million in TV advertising by Dukakis and $100,000 by
Jackson nationally, it shows good management,'' said Jackson's
state campaign chairman, Walter R. Stone.

Tactics'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on Wednesday
attacked conclusions about AIDS by sex researchers Dr. William
Masters and Virginia Johnson, saying their new book uses ``scare
tactics'' and is irresponsible and unscientfic.
   Koop said the sex experts have no scientific evidence to back up
claims that AIDS among heterosexuals is ``rampant,'' that the
disease can be spread by casual non-sexual contact or that the
nation's blood supply is unsafe.
   The surgeon general was reacting to findings from a Masters and
Johnson book co-authored by Dr. Robert Kolodny, ``Crisis:
Heterosexual Behavior in the Age of AIDS.'' Excerpts from th book
appeared in this week's Newsweek magazine.
   Koop, interviewed from London on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' noted that Masters and Johnson did not submit their
findings to scientific review or have them published in a
recognized medical journal.
   ``I think it (the book) is irresponsible. It is scare tactics,''
Koop said.
   He said the risk of AIDS-contaminated blood in medical blood
supplies ranges from one in 40,000 to one in 250,000. Masters and
Johnson claim it is one in 5,000, but Koop said there is no
evidence to support such a statistic.
   Koop said he feared the book would cause ``hysteria'' but added
that he hopes Americans would ``stick to their usual habit of
listening to the facts, sorting them out and doing what's right.''
   Masters and Johnson were pioneers in sex therapy and sex
research and run a sex therapy institute in St. Louis.
   Their new book calls for widespread mandatory testing for
acquired immune deficiency syndrome infections, and estimates there
are 3 million or more AIDS carriers in the United States. The
government estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million people
are infected.
   Koop acknowledged that there is an explosion of AIDS among
heterosexuals in Africa but said ``the United States is not like
Africa. ... That's not going to happen here.''
   Heterosexuals make up only 4 percent of AIDS cases, and this is
expected to increase to 5 percent by 1991, he said.
   Scientists say the disease is spread most often through
homosexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.
   If there were any truth to the possibility of AIDS being spread
through other means, Koop said, the government would be warning
against it. ``We have never gotten ahead of our scientific base,
and that's something the American people can rely on,'' he said.
   He said that among more than 50,000 AIDS cases so far in the
United States, ``not one single one was proven to be transmitted by
casual non-sexual contact.''
   He said Americans can take comfort from a survey of families of
people with the heriditory disease hemophilia, who were also AIDS
victims, mostly from blood transfusions. He said of 2,400 people
studied, there was not one case of the AIDS virus being passed to
another member of the family except between spouses due to sexual
contact. He said 7 percent of those in the study even shared a
toothbrush with the victim.
   ``AIDS is very hard to catch,'' Koop said.

   A state appeals panel has unanimously upheld the
conviction of a defendant in the botched 1981 Brink's robbery that
resulted in the deaths of two policemen and a guard.
   The state Appellate Division in Brooklyn rejected the appeal by
Sam Brown, 46, who is serving a 75-year to life sentence for his
murder and robbery conviction.
   The charges stemmed from the $1.6 million holdup of a Brink's
truck in Nanuet, north of New York City.
   Kathy Boudin, a former Weather Underground activist, pleaded
guilty to the charges and is serving a prison term of 20 years to
life. Three other defendants were convicted.
   Among the many arguments raised by Brown's lawyer and rejected
by the appeals panel was that the indictment should have been
dismissed because his rights were violated when he was beaten by
prison officials after his arrest and that government officials
interfered with his right to counsel.

<HEAD>Restaurant Guide Reduces Top Rated Restaurants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Michelin Guide, France's supreme arbiter of
culinary excellence, promoted one restaurant to the three-star
pinnacle Wednesday but elsewhere went on a star-shearing rampage.
   The coveted third star, which in Michelin parlance means
``exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey,'' went to Bernard
Pacaud, the 40-year-old chef of Paris' L'Ambroisie restaurant.
   The Auberge du Pere Bise in the Alpine town of Talloires was
demoted to two stars, signifying ``excellent cooking, worth a
detour.'' Another three-star restaurant was lost when Louis Outhier
retired and closed La Napoule near Cannes.
   The 1988 red guide, which went on sale Wednesday at $17, reduced
the number of stars it awarded from 656 last year to 635. The
number of three-star restaurants fell from 19 to 18, two-star
establishments declined from 92 to 88 and one-star eateries,
meaning ``very good cooking in its class,'' fell from 545 to 529.
   The addition of a star, actually a squiggle with six round
bumps, means fame for a chef and his restaurant and money in his
pocket. Loss of the symbol can mean anguish and despair,
particularly in a country that considers cooking an art form.
   Pacaud, of Breton origin, established his restaurant in 1986
after a long apprenticeship in top kitchens, including La Mere
Brazier in Lyon and under Marc Meneau at Vezelay and Claude Peyrot
in Paris.
   The red book, first published in France in 1900 by Andre
Michelin, the tire manufacturer, is a complete tourist guide and
basically is aimed at helping the motorist.
   Though many tend to think of the guide in terms of gastronomy,
it also contains a wealth of maps, information on hotels, repair
services, sights, distances between towns, telephone numbers,
prices and thousands of other useful tidbits for the traveler.
   Keeping up with the times, this year's guide notes hotels and
restaurants that have special rooms or a dining room specially
reserved for non-smokers.
   The Auberge du Pere Bise lost its third star once before,
between 1983 and 1985, when the owner became ill. It was promoted
again when his daughter took over, but appears to have run into
trouble again. The Michelin folk are typically vague.
   ``It's part of the life of an establishment,'' said Bernard
Naugellen, director of the guide. ``People sometimes reproach us
for not taking away enough stars. When a house goes down, we take
measures.''
   Naugellen had nothing but praise for Pacaud, whose specialities
include creme de homard and Florentine raviolis, turbot braised in
spices and braised ox-tail.
   ``He is a young chef who is doing a classic cuisine, a
traditional cuisine, but very intelligent, full of finesse and
character,'' he said.
   The chef himself refused comment.

<HEAD>Pieces Missing From Titan Rocket Motor After Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chunks missing from a Titan 4 motor
after a recent ground test could mean a delay in the first
scheduled launch of the rocket in October, the San Jose Mercury
News reported Wednesday.
   The test was conducted Feb. 14 at the San Jose research
facilities of United Technologies Corp., whose engineers, along
with Air Force specialists, are trying to find out if a flaw might
require retesting or redesign, the newspaper said.
   U.S. space officials have been counting on the Titan 4 to carry
into orbit dozens of satellites.
   ``There are some chunks missing, not terribly large,'' spokesman
Rick Huling of the El Segundo Air Force unit said. ``I think in one
particular case the burn was down fairly close to the metal on the
outside of the (nozzle) casing. If the flames had burned through
the remaining insulation and ruptured the metal nozzle case, then
you've had it.''
   A smaller Titan 34D rocket exploded April 18, 1986, during
launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base when some insulation broke
loose inside the motor. The heat burned through the rocket's outer
wall.
   The Titan 4 launch, scheduled for October from the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., would take up a classified military
payload that analysts have said is a satellite equipped with a
heat-sensitive infrared telescope to spot nuclear missile attacks.
   ``We have a backlog of space shuttle-size loads,'' said Huling.
``The Titan 4 is, in fact, going to be the substitute for anything
that doesn't need a man up there in space. I would say we need to
get up there as quickly as possible.''
   The manned shuttle program was put on hold after the Challenger
explosion, with the target date for the next launch set for Aug. 4.

failed, pens wouldn't write and rescuers weren't dressed for the
cold, the rescue coordinator testified today.
   Continental Flight 1713 crashed while taking off from Stapleton
International Airport last Nov. 15 in a snowstorm and left 28
people dead and 54 injured.
   ``We feel fortunate we had that many survivors,'' said Dr.
Michael Brunko of Denver General Hospital, who was in charge of the
rescue operation at the crash. He was testifying on the second day
of a National Transportation Safety Board hearing.
   ``Obviously, there were people trapped in the wreckage who we
could not do anything for. And to this day, I do not know what else
could have been done,'' he said. The overall operation ``went very,
very well,'' he said.
   Among the problems, Brunko said, were the fact that there were
too many rescue workers and vehicles on the scene and that
Continental employees were questioning survivors at the site, even
though the employees role had been part of an earlier crash
rehearsal at the airport.
   ``We survived by adrenaline,'' he said of the cold and snow.
   Brunko said there were so many emergency vehicles that he had to
run 10 to 15 feet away to escape background noise so he could
communicate with the airport command post.
   The four-day NTSB hearing is expected to lead to a report
detailing factors that may have contributed to the crash.
   Brunko's testimony this morning jibed with investigation reports
released Tuesday by the NTSB that quoted one firefighter as saying
rescue personnel at the crash site were ``10 deep and waiting to
get in to help.''
   ``We had more personnel than we needed,'' Brunko said.
   Rescue workers also said that ``the Continental people got in
the way of medical treatment of the passengers,'' according to the
report.
   Brunko said that at one point at least 15 Continental employees
arrived at the crash site, many of them heading for the nose of the
aircraft, which had flipped upside down on the runway and broken
into three pieces.
   He said he had identified about 20 patients needing treatment
before the Continental employees arrived, and their presence made
him suddenly uncertain who were patients and who were airline
employees.
   The NTSB report outlined several problems found by a review
team, including the lack of a staging area for rescue vehicles that
caused ambulances to arrive an estimated 45 minutes after the crash.
   ``I was shocked at the number of people running around who were
not firemen,'' Ron Fano, director of airport operations, testified
Tuesday.
   Fano, who headed the rescue command post, said some operations
were delayed because of two seriously injured passengers inside the
post.
   He said buses to transport the injured did not show up until
about an hour after the accident and ambulances did not show up for
45 minutes.
   The report also said firefighters were trained to extinguish
fires on older models of aircraft, and had difficulty rescuing
survivors.
   The NTSB team did not directly criticize the rescue effort.
Denver Fire Chief Richard Gonzales said he believed the work ``went
rather smothly.''
   The report said Continental employees may have interfered with
medical treatment of passengers by trying to interview them at a
nearby fire station.
   However, Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said airline
employees routinely are involved in rescue efforts, and he noted
that Continental workers participated in a crash drill at Stapleton
two months before the crash.
   De-icing and the pilots' experience flying DC-9s were the other
chief issues raised during testimony Tuesday, although government
officials have said their inquiry is not focusing on a single
possible cause.
   One survivor told investigators he saw ice and snow on one of
the wings, but another survivor who also was concerned about ice
said the wings only were wet. A pilot on another plane said the
Continental jet looked clear.
   Wes Zimmerman, a Continental pilot whose 727-300 aircraft was on
the runway at the same time as the Continental jetliner, testified
he saw no ice or snow buildup on Flight 1713.
   ``I felt good about how my de-icing was holding up,'' he said,
explaining that he looked at nearby aircraft to gauge the condition
of his own plane. But he acknowledged that his plane did not sit as
long between de-icing and takeoff as Flight 1713 did.
   Robert Benzon, charge of the NTSB inquiry, said during his
opening statement that officials want to know why 24 minutes
elapsed between de-icing and takeoff when other planes on the
runway took off within 15 minutes.
   Two Flight 1713 passengers, Dr. Fred Helpenstell, 56, of Nampa,
Idaho, and Gregory Wadsworth, 22, an airman stationed in Idaho,
testified they were concerned there might have been ice on the
wings before takeoff.
   ``I wondered at one point, `Is that ice?''' Helpenstell
recalled, ``but I decided it was just wet.''
   Wadsworth, who is stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base,
said he had a clear view of the left wing.
   ``It had started to snow a lot harder, and it made me real
nervous. It was like the snow was starting to pike up (on the
wings),'' he said. ``I was very concerned, but I said it under my
breath.''

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who
called delegate-rich Florida a bellwether state because of its
diversity, swept aside his Democratic opponents in the presidential
primary.
   His well-financed campaign used heavy television advertising to
spread from a liberal base in southeast Florida to win 15 of the
state 19 congressional districts. Jesse Jackson won three and
Tennessee Sen. Al Gore Jr. won only the conservative Panhandle.
   ``This is a diverse group of voters in Florida,'' Dukakis
campaign field director Paul Pezzella said. ``If we can win here,
we can win anywhere.''
   With all 4,459 precincts reporting, Dukakis had 509,248 votes or
41 percent; Jackson 250,579 votes or 20 percent; Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt 179,400 votes or 14 percent, and Gore had 158,833
votes or 13 percent.
   Vice President George Bush crushed his Republican rivals,
winning 545,668 votes or 62 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had
185,179 votes or 21 percent; former television evangelist Pat
Robertson had 93,752 votes or 11 percent, and New York Rep. Jack
Kemp had 40,545 votes or 5 percent.
   Based on those results, Bush was expected to win all 82 of
Florida's GOP delegates; Dukakis would win 90 of the 136 Democratic
delegates at stake; Jackson would get 33 delegates; Gephardt 7 and
Gore 6.
   Florida offered the second-largest batch of delegates on Super
Tuesday, behind only Texas, which Bush and Dukakis also carried.
   Bush capitalized on President Reagan's popularity and his own
familiarity to Floridians. He has visited often on official
business such as heading the South Florida Task Force on Drugs, and
for personal visits to his mother in Palm Beach and to his son,
Jeb, now Florida's commerce secretary.
   The Bush campaign had five full-time paid staffers compared to
16 for Dukakis, and both were bankrolled for a strong television
push to reach the diverse Florida electorate on the final weekend
preceding Tuesday's vote.
   Gephardt's poor showing was the biggest surprise in the
Democratic race. Endorsed by Rep. Claude Pepper and using a
last-minute media campaign, Gephardt had concerned the Dukakis
campaign most. He failed to carry a single district.

<HEAD>West Germany's Chancellor From 1966-69 Dead at Age 83</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kurt Georg Kiesinger, who served
as West Germany's third federal chancellor from 1966 to 1969
despite controversy over his Nazi past, died Wednesday of heart
failure. He was 83.
   Kiesinger spent 18 months in a U.S. postwar internment camp with
other Nazi party members, but he staunchly denied any wrongdoing
during Adolf Hitler's Third Reich and never was charged with any
crimes.
   In a widely publicized incident, Kiesinger was slapped in the
face by Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld at a conference in West Berlin
on Nov. 7, 1968.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld was convicted of causing bodily injury and
insulting Kiesinger, and after receiving and appealing a one-year
prison sentence, was given four months' probation. She continued
her bitter public criticism of Kiesinger.
   During his three years at the helm of the nation's Grand
Coalition of conservatives and leftist-leaning Social Democrats,
Kiesinger improved contacts with the East.
   The Christian Democratic chancellor also overcame a troubling
recession with a series of economic measures during his term.
   Known as ``King Silver Tongue'' because of his powerful speaking
style, Kiesinger retained his heavy Swabian accent. He was a Roman
Catholic, born April 6, 1904, in Ebingen in Baden-Wuerttemburg.
   As a 29-year-old lawyer, Kiesinger joined the Nazi party in
1933, the year Hitler came to power. He said he became
disillusioned with the party a year later because of the bloody
purge of storm trooper leader Ernst Roehm and his associates.
   During World War II, Kiesinger worked in the radio propaganda
section of the Nazi foreign ministry and served as department head
for part of the war.
   After the war, U.S. forces rounded up thousands of Germans
pending investigations of their membership in the Nazi Party. He
spent 18 months in an internment camp in Ludwigsburg.
   A German court fined him 50 marks, then $12.50, for being a
party member. The fine was returned when the court ruled later that
he had risked his life to get a student out of a Nazi prison.
   Kiesinger's Nazi past brought him much unfavorable publicity
when he became a candidate for chancellor, and the sharp, public
debate continued during his term.
   He always denied any wrongdoing and declared: ``I have clean
hands. I know what I did and what I did not do.''
   Kiesinger was a party member for the full 12 years of the Nazi
regime from 1933 to 1945.
   In 1966, Kiesinger succeeded fellow Christian Democrat
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, forming the only Grand Coalition of
conservatives and Social Democrats.
   Kiesinger sought more contact with the communist states of
Eastern Europe, breaking with past policy. He established
diplomatic relations with Romania and Yugoslavia, but his overtures
suffered a setback when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Kiesinger's government remained a resolute ally of the United
States, but he feuded with President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 and
complained that he had not been adequately consulted on a
U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons treaty.
   He was a symbol of reconciliation, grouping the conservative
Christian Democrats and their Bavarian counterparts with the Social
Democrats.

<HEAD>Movie Portrays Suicide Of Small-Town Girl Turned Porn Queen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six years ago, a small-town Minnesota girl
left home for Hollywood. But her dreams of stardom turned into an
X-rated nightmare of porn movies and cocaine addiction, and two
years later, she committed suicide.
   Her mother, Karen Applegate, is still searching for answers in
the March 21, 1984, death of her 20-year-old daughter, Colleen. She
and her family cooperated with Hollywood in a television movie
based on Colleen's life in hopes that it might prevent similar
tragedies.
   ``Shattered Innocence,'' Wednesday night on CBS, depicts the
final years of Miss Applegate, who left her Farmington home in
March 1982, posed nude for magazine photos and soon became porn
movie star Shauna Grant.
   Her name and hometown were changed in the film, but her mother
said: ``The whole mess is true. The basic story is true. And why? I
don't know.''
   While the mother said she was generally satisfied with the film,
she felt the horror of the worlds of pornography and cocaine
addiction were soft-pedaled.
   At the peak of her career, Shauna Grant made 30 X-rated movies
in one year and had film sex with about 40 men. The movie, however,
gave the impression that Grant made only a few films.
   ``The producers originally had a dramatization closer to the
gritty details, but it had to be softened because of prime-time
television,'' production representative Karen Ocamb said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles.
   ``You get the idea of what the world of pornography is all
about, what it does to the individual is that it kills her.''
   ``Shattered Innocence'' tells of a high school cheerleader who
is bored and restless with her life in Banning, Kan., and after
graduation heads for the bright lights and glitter of Hollywood.
   Dazzled by the quick money to be made in nude modeling, up to
$2,000 a session for national magazines, she soon went for even
bigger purses offered by porn films. She then started using cocaine
to lose weight.
   Throughout the film, she maintains contact with her family. Her
mother loves her but doesn't excuse or condone her behavior.
   ``It is very difficult for the family. They try to intervene but
she wants the family to love her on her terms, not theirs,'' Ocamb
said.
   After briefly giving up her pornographic movie career, but being
unable to kick the cocaine addiction, the young woman portrayed by
actress Jonna Lee is about to re-enter the world of pornography
when she kills herself.
   ``The mother asks, `Why did this happen?' That's basically what
the film asks,'' said Ocamb. ``There are no answers. Everyone in
every family needs to ask this question. How did a cheerleader
become a porno star and commit suicide?''
   The movie was made because Colleen Applegate's story is
representative of so many young people, Ocamb said.
   ``There are a lot of kids who come from Farmington, Minnesota,
or Banning, Kansas. They're just immature and irresponsible and
they think they can come to Hollywood and become a star overnight
or they'll just `find something.'
   ``As we know, they wind up on the streets,'' Ocamb said.
   The Applegates _ Colleen had three younger sisters and one
younger brother _ cooperated with the producers in hopes the movie
might help someone else, said the mother, who is portrayed by
actress Melinda Dillon.
   ``For people out there who think that it's exploiting her and
exploiting ourselves, then they should be very grateful because
then they can't relate to it,'' she said.
   ``There are many out there who can relate to it, and those are
the ones I hope it helps.''

<HEAD>Wroclaw `Happening' Organizer Receives Two-Month Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Wednesday sentenced an activist
to two months in prison because of a ``street happening'' that
poked fun at the government, an opposition spokesman said.
   Waldemar Frydrych, 34, head of the opposition cultural group
Orange Alternative, was arrested by police with five other people
on Tuesday, said Jacek Kuron, a Warsaw opposition activist.
   He said about 50 Orange Alternative supporters, some of whom
carried a banner reading ``Missiles _ no, sanitary pads _ yes,''
handed out cotton pads to women in downtown Wroclaw. Police moved
in quickly and halted the demonstration.
   Feminie hygiene products are in short supply in Poland. Tuesday
was International Women's Day.
   The sentence marked one of the few times since a September 1986
amnesty for political prisoners that a misdemeanor court has
sentenced someone to prison for a politically motivated offense. In
almost all cases, people were held up to 48 hours and released
after being fined.
   Kuron said Frydrych was sentenced on a charge of causing public
unrest.
   Two other Orange Alternative supporters, Pawel Kasprzak and
Krzysztof Albin, were each fined the equivalent of $79 by the
misdemeanor court, Kuron said.
   He said the Orange Alternative members joked with the court by
arguing that Karl Marx, the founder of communism, was actually a
bearded lady.
   Frydrych has been detained at least half a dozen times since
September for organizing various Orange Alternative ``happenings''
in Wroclaw in which demonstrators have dressed up as Santa Claus,
Lenten penitents and even secret policemen to satirize government
policies.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS two grafs at end, SCCA has no listing for Terry Knight</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A convicted marijuana smuggler
testified in the cocaine-smuggling trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas
that the Colombian had helped finance Terry Knight, identified as a
former auto racing partner of actor Paul Newman.
   The brief mention of Newman came Tuesday as defense attorney Ed
Shohat questioned witness Charles Gregory Von Eberstein.
   Knight lived on the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay. Von
Eberstein testified that he had seen a picture of Knight's car with
the insignia of the Norman's Cay Yacht Club on it.
   When Shohat asked if Newman, the actor, was in the picture, Von
Eberstein answered, ``I knew Terry was his racing partner. I knew
(Lehder) had put some money in it.''
   The witness said he didn't believe Knight was aware of the
smuggling going on at the island.
   Lehder, 38, is accused of conspiring with others to smuggle some
3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia from 1978
to 1980 via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   Newman has long taken part in auto races as a sideline to his
acting career. His last partner, Jim Fitzgerald, died last November
when he crashed his car during the St. Petersburg Grand Prix. There
was no elaboration on Knight's career in Tuesday's testimony.
   Von Eberstein testified Tuesday that he had decided not to
return to the United States after Knight played an audio tape which
indicated Von Eberstein and his associate Ed Ward had been
indicted. The source of the tape and how Knight got it were not
disclosed in testimony.
   Von Eberstein, a friend and neighbor of Ward, a convicted
smuggler, testified that he and Ward made several cocaine flights
for Lehder in 1979 and 1980. He said one was into Colombia and
several were from Norman's Cay, Lehder's private Bahamian island,
to Prison Airport near Reidsville, Ga.
   Von Eberstein, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1981
after pleading guilty to three marijuana charges and one count of
income-tax evasion, eventually had his sentence reduced to 15 years
and was released after four years in prison.
   Lehder, reputed to be one of the leaders in the violent
Colombian Medellin cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession
of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   A woman who works in the records department of the Sports Car
Club of America in Englewood, Colo., said the club keeps listings
for racers registered in the last three years and had no listing
for a Terry Knight.
   The woman, who declined to give her name, said there was no way
to be certain who Newman's partner was.

   Michael Dukakis went from the triumph of his
seven Super Tuesday victories to the scrap-strewn wasteland of
Chicago's southeast corner on Wednesday, seeking votes in the
Democrats' next major campaign test.
   The Massachusetts governor talked to steel workers _ some laid
off, some on the job _ in his first full day of campaigning for
next Tuesday's Illinois primary, when 173 delegates will be at
stake.
   Gone were the condominiums and strawberry festivals of the
Florida primary campaign. Now Dukakis was campaigning for votes
among steel mills, scrap heaps, refineries and belching smokestacks.
   Dukakis did only slightly better on Tuesday than rivals Albert
Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson. But he quickly tried to stake out a
claim as the only national candidate in the race capable of winning
in the South and the industrial Midwest.
   He said of Gore, the Tennessee senator, ``I'm not so sure he's a
major contender. A guy from Massachusetts beat him in Texas, beat
him in Florida. He wasn't willing to go into the early primaries.
But I still take everyone seriously.''
   With two Illinois residents in the race _ Jackson and Sen. Paul
Simon _ ``obviously it's going to be an uphill battle,'' Dukakis
said. ``I hope when the people of Illinois cast their votes they'll
do so for someone who can clearly win the presidency.''
   In a dig at another rival, he said the failure of Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt to win any but his home state on Super Tuesday
proved the futility of negative campaigning. Dukakis, who had
countered with an anti-Gephardt ad of his own, said, ``I think that
what happened to Congressman Gephardt yesterday demonstrates pretty
clearly that when you engage in that kind of campaigning, you're
going to get hurt.''
   Dukakis opened the day at a breakfast meeting at the Lion's Den
restaurant on Chicago's east side where he met with laid-off steel
workers. ``I don't know a great deal about the steel industry as
such,'' Dukakis told the group. But he said he did have experience
in Massachusetts getting labor, management and government working
together.
   Later the governor and his wife Kitty donned hard hats as they
toured the Metron Steel factory in Chicago's hard-hit Calumet
industrial section.
   Aware of Walter Mondale's disastrous showing in 1984, Dukakis
has avoided appearing to be too strong a union Democrat. Rather, he
said he wanted to be ``a full-employment Democrat.''
   Jack Corrigan, Dukakis' campaign operations director, said there
would be no change in the candidate's message now that he is in the
nation's industrial section.
   ``We haven't gotten the AFL-CIO endorsement. We've gotten some
union support and we're proud of it. I don't see it as a problem.''
   Despite the cash drain of Super Tuesday with its emphasis on
television advertising, the Dukakis campaign remains in good
financial condition, aides said. Campaign finance chief Robert
Farmer said Dukakis is raising half a million dollars a week.
Coming out of Super Tuesday, he said, Dukakis has $2 million in the
bank and $1 million on the way in federal matching funds. ``We're
going to be in very good shape,'' Farmer said.
   Dukakis made it clear in a speech to about 1,000 cheering
supporters Tuesday night in Chicago that his Greek immigrant
heritage will provide a key ingredient of his campaign in Illinois.
The Chicago area is among the most ethnically diverse in the nation
with its heavy population of first- and second-generation Eastern
Europeans.
   ``Many of your families, like my parents, came to this land in
search of opportunity,'' Dukakis told the cheering supporters.
``They didn't have much money in their pockets; they couldn't speak
the language, but they believed in the American dream... It was
their broad shoulders and strong arms and keen minds that built the
mightiest industrial machine in the world.''
   ``It was their hard work that built the steel mills and the auto
plants and the foundries and the factories that carried our nation
through two world wars,'' Dukakis said. The phrases were new to an
otherwise standard campaign stump speech.

   Former Gov. Charles Robb was recovering
Wednesday from what he described as ``a very physical encounter
with a glass door.''
   Robb was knocked unconscious Tuesday night when he walked into
the closed door in his Washington, D.C., office. Robb said he
``blacked out for a few moments'' but did not require medical
attention.
   ``I haven't had a sensation like that since the last time I
played in a football game,'' Robb said.
   Robb, one of the architects of the Super Tuesday presidential
primaries, said he was talking to a television cameraman as he was
leaving his office. ``I had a pretty good head of steam because I
had a lot of news interviews scheduled,'' Robb said.
   The door normally is open, he said. The glass did not break.
   Minutes later, Robb cut short an appearance on the Cable News
Network. ``I couldn't remember why I was there for a few minutes,''
he said. ``Finally, I said on the air that I wouldn't be doing the
viewers a service by continuing.''
   Robb said he was interviewed by other news organizations
throughout the night, but he asked that the interviews be kept
brief.
   ``People kept trying to get me to go to the hospital, but I was
hard-headed,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The People's Consultative Assembly
gathers Thursday to elect President Suharto, the only candidate, to
his fifth five-year term.
   The 1,000-member assembly, which meets every five years, began a
session last week to choose the president and vice president and
issue new guidelines for state policy.
   Suharto has led the nation of 170 million people since 1967.
   For vice president, the Moslem United Development Party has
nominated its chairman, Jailani Naro, to run against State
Secretary Sudharmono, chairman of the governing Golkar Party and
Suharto's most trusted aide. The vice president is to be elected on
Friday.
   Naro said that despite advice from several senior assembly
members to drop his candidacy, it was his democratic right to run
for election and ``we will fight 'til the end.''
   Sudharmono was nominated by Golkar and supported by the
military, provincial and Indonesian Democratic Party factions in
the assembly.
   All five factions, including the Moslem United Development
Party, nominated Suharto for president.
   The five factions also approved Suharto's 35-page report on the
state of the nation under his administration in the last five years.
   In his report last week, Suharto said his administration had
been able to overcome unpredictable challenges and difficulties,
including a recession and a sharp drop in the price of oil, a major
foreign exchange earner for Indonesia.
   He said Indonesia's economy was expected to grow by an annual
average of 3.6 percent during the five-year economic period ending
in March 1989. The original target had been 5 percent.
   In elections last April, Golkar won 299 seats in Parliament,
which also has 100 government-nominated members from the military.
The Moslem United Development Party has 63 seats and the Indonesian
Democratic Party 38 seats.
   The 500-member Parliament and 500 provincial and district
officials make up the People's Consultative Assembly, the highest
policy-making body in the country.
   Seats in provincial and district legislatures were decided by
proportional representation based on the total votes each party
received.
   In the assembly, Golkar has 548 seats as well as 151
government-nominated members from the military and 147 from the
provinces. The Moslem United Development Party has 93 and the
Indonesian Democratic Party 61.

<HEAD>Dukakis Beats Jackson in Two-Man Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii's Democratic caucuses came down to a test
of strength between party leaders' support for Michael Dukakis and
grassroots organizing by followers of Jesse Jackson. The
Massachusetts governor won, but Jackson performed impressively.
   Dukakis received 2,026 votes in the presidential preference
poll, compared with Jackson's 1,470 votes, according to incomplete
returns Wednesday.
   ``This is the first time we've really had a race,'' said Gov.
John Waihee, a Dukakis supporter. ``I don't ever remember this much
excitement.''
   Dukakis was expected to get 12 of the 20 pledged delegates that
were up for grabs, with Jackson getting the rest.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Jackson's state coordinator Richard
Port. ``Jackson showed his appeal to Hawaii's multi-cultural
voters. That's the real story here.''
   Much of Jackson's support was thought to have come from the
2,000 new party members his organization signed in recent months.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt received 83 votes, Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon 46, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 41, and former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart 83. There were 183 votes for
``uncommitted.''

   A sick and hungry panda cub that a farmer found
tangled in tree branches has bounced back to health, boosting
efforts to save the increasingly scarce animal, it was reported
Wednesday.
   Cun Cun _ or ``Spring Spring'' _ was found in the mountains of
Tianquan county in Sichuan province and rushed to a zoo in the
Sichuan capital of Chengdu, the China News Service said.
   ``When this panda arrived at the zoo, he was in very bad shape.
He had contracted an intestinal virus, was severely dehydrated and
very weak,'' a zoo official was quoted as saying.
   The giant panda, native only to China, has become an endangered
species. The number in China has dropped below 1,000 and scientists
have had limited success breeding them in captivity.
   About 200 pandas are in Chinese zoos, but some experts have
called for a halt their capture, arguing that they live longer and
reproduce better in the wild.

<HEAD>Police Reported Roaming Tibetan Capital After Anti-Chinese Unrest</HEAD>

   Truckloads of police and cars with wailing
sirens patrolled the Tibetan capital of Lhasa through the night in
an apparent show of force after an anti-Chinese uprising by
thousands of Tibetans, a Western source said Wednesday.
   The Westerner, a tourist who reached Chengdu from Lhasa, said
the trucks drove past the Lhasa Hotel where he was staying after
midnight.
   A Tibetan source in Lhasa reported similar police movement both
day and night since the Saturday uprising, in which Buddhist monks
and thousands of Tibetans stoned police and built bonfires across
the city.
   Asked if she was frightened, the source said, ``No, I'm not
frightened because _ ,'' but the telephone line was broken in
midsentence.
   The Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest leader,
denounced those who participated in the all-day violence.
   ``I represent the Tibetan comrades here and myself in expressing
my indignation ... at the violence committed by the small numbers
of separatists during the riot,'' the Panchen Lama, a loyal
supporter of the Beijing government, said at a special meeting of
Tibetan leaders in Beijing on Wednesday.
   The Panchen Lama called for severe punishment for the rioters,
saying, ``As a Tibetan and a devout Buddhist, I cannot condone this
kind of crime.''
   The evening news devoted nearly five minutes to the Panchen
Lama's remarks and briefly showed footage of Saturday's rioting.
   Doje Cering, chairman of Tibet's regional government, said
official policy toward Tibet would not change because of the
rioting, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Lhasa TV said one Tibetan and a Chinese policeman were killed,
but Western sources in Lhasa said as many as five Tibetans and
three police may have died.
   Western tourists arriving in Katmandu, Nepal, on Wednesday
reported seeing five people dead, including a 10-year-old Tibetan
monk, two Tibetans and two Chinese.
   The Western tourist in Chengdu, in southwestern China, reported
being allowed to visit Sera Monastery on the southern edge of the
city, one of Lhasa's leading monasteries.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said a truck carrying
about 20 armed police was parked along the road to the monastery
and two police officers watched the entrance.
   By contrast, Sera and other leading monasteries were cut off by
police blockades after the last Tibetan protest against Chinese
rule on Oct. 1. At least 14 people died then.
   China sent troops into Tibet in 1950, but it has claimed
sovereignty over the Himalayan region since the 13th century.
   Many Tibetans maintain they were effectively independent for
centuries under the Dalai Lama, their temporal and religious
leader. The current Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an
abortive anti-Chinese uprising.
   Thursday is the 29th anniversary of the uprising.
   There were unconfirmed reports from Lhasa of widespread arrests
in the city. Officials released no figures, however.
   The Western source said police set up two checkpoints along the
road from the Lhasa airport to the city and were stopping vehicles
and asking passengers to get out for a check of their identity.
   Saturday's violence was followed by a small confrontation Sunday
in which Tibetans built barricades and threw stones at police in
Lhasa's central market square.
   Saturday was the final day of the ``moinlam qenmo'' prayer
festival, a more than 500-year-old annual event that is one of the
most important in the Tibetan Buddhist calender.
   Chinese authorities had feared pro-independence Tibetans would
take advantage of the gathering of hundreds of monks and pilgrims
to stage a protest.
   One source said Chinese police in Tibet were put on orders
during the festival to exercise restraint. The source said Tibet's
Communist Party Secretary Wu Jinghua ordered police to retreat from
any confrontation. Reports from several Western sources indicated
police initially did so, then fired tear gas to control the crowd.
   Xinhua reported earlier that no police officers carried arms
while on duty Saturday.
   One Western source reported gunshots being fired after nightfall
Saturday after more than 12 hours of violence. None of the Western
witnesses reported seeing police open fire.

<HEAD>Gore, Dukakis Still Have Much to Prove</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the next few weeks, Al Gore needs to prove
what Mike Dukakis demonstrated on Super Tuesday _ that he can win
outside his home region, that he's not just another favorite son.
   And now Dukakis has something new to prove _ that he can win
primary after primary across the country, become the front-runner
and build the momentum to clinch the Democratic nomination before
the convention opens in August.
   No one is conceding an inch to the Massachusetts governor, who
now sports a lead in delegates and wins in the mega-states of
Florida and Texas on Tuesday.
   The calendar should now give Dukakis a little edge, shifting
from the Southern accents of Super Tuesday to some of the nation's
toughest political battlegrounds _ the big industrial states of
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania.
   As the governor of a major Northeastern industrial state with a
strong ethnic background, Dukakis should have less trouble speaking
the voters' language in the upcoming states than he did in the
South.
   Gore has exactly the opposite problem _ he just had the contests
in his best region and is now moving to less familiar ground.
   ``What state is Al Gore going to win in the North?'' is how
Dukakis aide Leslie Dach posed the problem.
   The Tennessee senator and Jesse Jackson each won a goodly share
of the states and the delegates available Tuesday, splintering the
standings among the Democratic hopefuls with Dukakis.
   That proved both are winners, essential to continuing in the
race, even though the victories were on home turf.
   But Dukakis proved more _ he won at home but also in the South,
a region critical to the Democrats' hopes of regaining the White
House. He showed he could win in a variety of regions of the
country _ from Texas to Washington.
   One big advantage Dukakis now has is his bank account.
   ``We've got $2 million in the bank and $1 million more coming in
federal matching money,'' Dach said Wednesday.
   That, plus a well-regarded campaign organization, is a major
advantage in big states where television advertising is expensive.
   Organization will be an asset in the major behind-the-scenes
battle over the next two months that could be the key to the
nomination. Dukakis is working hard to convince the 645
super-delegates _ governors, members of Congress, senators and
Democratic National Committee members _ that he will be the nominee
and that they should join his effort.
   In contrast, Gore had to borrow a $1 million to finish his
Southern media advertising. But Gore said he has $500,000 to $1
million on hand to fight on.
   Gore's campaign has had its share of organizational problems
over the past few months, as it struggled, for example, with the
question of how much effort to put into the New Hampshire primary.
   The next battleground is Illinois with two favorite sons on the
ballot _ Jackson and Sen. Paul Simon.
   Simon, saying no candidate will have enough delegates to win
going into the Democratic convention in August, hopes to restart
his stalled campaign with a homestate victory next Tuesday. But
even he concedes that is not enough.
   ``Nobody's going to have that first-ballot nomination,'' Simon
said Wednesday. ``But I also have to win in Wisconsin or Ohio or
Pennsylvania or New York.''
   Dukakis was already in Chicago on Tuesday night, working for a
good showing.
   Gore said Wednesday, ``We're going to be competing vigorously
there.''
   The big loser among the Democrats on Tuesday will not even be in
Illinois. Rep. Richard Gephardt could could only manage a Super
Tuesday win in his home state of Missouri. He is heading to
Michigan for the March 26 caucuses there.
   Illinois could turn out to be a crucial state for the Democrats
_ just as it may be for the Republicans.
   If neither Simon nor Jackson wins at home, the candidate who
does win would get an enormous boost. And Simon's hopes would
dwindle away.
   In contrast, a favorite-son victory would not be an equally
important boost for the victor, since such wins tend to be expected.

<HEAD>Government to Tax Cooperative Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The growing number of private businesses spawned
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms may soon face an enemy
long familiar to their capitalist counterparts: higher taxes.
   The draft of a new law on private enterprises, published in the
government newspaper Izvestia, outlines plans to tax the profits of
the new ventures as well as the incomes of their workers.
   While the law remains in draft form, it is likely to earn
approval from the nation's nominal parliament, the Supreme Soviet,
at its next session expected in late spring.
   Gorbachev last week cited the taxation plan in an apparent
effort to assure workers in state-run businesses that they should
not feel their private counterparts are getting off easy.
   ``It's understood that we need industrious and honest
initiative, but not of the kind of some cooperatives which exploit
a deficit and engage in outright money-grabbing,'' the Soviet
leader told workers at a Moscow factory.
   Many cooperatives charge higher prices than state-run industries
and services, and complaints about this have appeared in the Soviet
press. Many Soviets say, for instance, that while food quality and
selection are better in cooperative restaurants, the prices are out
of their reach.
   The government, while proposing broader opportunities for
cooperatives, also apparently felt the need to tap the businesses'
wealth, calling this approach ``social fairness.''
   The law does not specify at what rate cooperatives will be
taxed, saying this will depend on the kind of business. It said the
tax rate will be fixed for five-year periods. Cooperatives can
deduct from their taxes contributions to charities, and the
government may give some businesses tax breaks for producing
certain high-demand items, according to the law.
   Personal income taxes will be progressive, the law said.
Currently, a social security tax is deducted from the pay of
workers in state-run enterprises.
   The law on private business that took effect May 1 already
provided for a heavy individual tax structure that gave the
government claim to 70 percent of incomes in excess of 600 rubles,
or $1,000, per month.

   President Reagan said today he sees ``a
will to succeed evident in our land'' reminiscent of the spirit of
legendary football coach Knute Rockne, who led Notre Dame to five
undefeated seasons.
   Reagan, unveiling a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th
anniversary of Rockne's birth, reminisced both about Rockne's
storied career and his own role in Hollywood's portrayal of it.
   And the president used the occasion to predict a rosy future for
U.S. business.
   ``American industry is lean and mean and ready to meet the
competition head-on,'' he said. ``I predict that, as this year
progresses, we will see American manufacturing re-emerge as the
leading force in the world marketplace. Exports will, in fact, race
ahead and lead our domestic economy.''
   Reagan said the Rockne legend ``stood for fair play and honor,
but you know, it was thorougly American in another way. It was
practical; it placed a value on devastating quickness and agility
and on confounding the opposition with good old American
cleverness. But most of all, the Rockne legend meant this ... that
on or off the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is
faith that makes great things happen.''
   Reagan said Rockne recognized ``the fundamental element of the
American character that no tyranny and few of our competitors can
ever hope to match. Knute Rockne knew and appreciated it: The
creative genius and omnipresent optimism of our people.''
   Reagan also reminisced about his own heyday in Hollywood, when
he convinced a producer to allow him to play the part of George
Gipp in the movie ``Knute Rockne: All American.'' Gipp was the
Notre Dame football player whose deathbed request to Rockne _ ``Win
just one for the Gipper'' _ inspired the team to a 12-6 victory
over Army in 1928.
   Reagan called the part ``a young actor's dream'' and he said the
movie still has a message for Americans:
   ``There's a will to succeed evident in our land. I happen to
have always believed in the American people. Don't ever sell them
short. Given the proper tools and a level playing ground, our
workers can out-produce and out-compete anyone, anywhere.''
   He added that ``there are those who see a dark side to our
technological progress'' with the development of more deadly
weapons.
   However, the president said, ``Technology is pointing a way out
of this dilemma'' and cited his ``Star Wars'' space-based missile
defense system.
   The crowd in Joyce Athletic Center was treated to several
minutes of the Rockne film on a giant screen showing the young
Reagan as he portrayed Gipp throwing the ball and hustling with his
teammates.
   At the end of Reagan's speech, he was handed a football which he
hurled toward a group of players seated in the crowd. Heisman
trophy winner Tim Brown caught the pigskin as the crowd roared its
approval.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``the Gipper goes
back'' as he announced the trip. During his presidency, Reagan's
supporters have seized upon his movie-inspired nickname to help
build support for his political programs.
   The president himself recalled the emotional movie during his
first visit to Notre Dame's South Bend campus, when he delivered
the commencement address on May 17, 1981.
   Rockne, a graduate of the men's college, was its head football
coach from 1918 to 1931 and compiled a record of 108 wins, 12
defeats and five ties. During his tenure, the ``Fighting Irish''
were undefeated in five seasons and won six national championships.
   An innovator of the forward pass and the ``box formation,''
Rockne taught his players to excel in the classroom as well as the
playing field.
   Rockne was killed in a plane crash on March 31, 1931, an
accident that stunned the nation. His funeral Mass was broadcast
across the nation on radio.
   He won a place in the College Football Hall of Fame's first
group of inductees in 1951.
   The 22-cent stamp produced in his honor bears a portrait of the
smiling, balding coach holding a football. Rockne's name is
emblazoned in blue and gold, the colors of the ``Fighting Irish.''
   It is the sixth in the American Sports series, which has honored
Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Bobby Jones, Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe and
Roberto Clemente.
   The stamp was a joint effort of designer Peter Cocci and
engraver Tom Hipschen, both of the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the White House said.
   The new stamp goes on sale nationally tomorrow.

   Queen Mother Elizabeth has expressed dismay at the
closure of a Welsh geriatric ward she officially opened less than a
year ago, her office said Wednesday.
   It said the 87-year-old mother of Queen Elizabeth II, the
reigning monarch, was expected to write to the government querying
the cost-cutting closure at St. Tydfil's Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.
   The Merthyr and Cynon Valley Health Council said the comptroller
at Clarence House, the queen mother's official residence, had
written to say she heard of the closure ``with much distress.''
   She visited Merthyr Tydfil last April to reopen the refurbished
hospital, including a six-bed dependency ward that was closed eight
months later as part of a budget-cutting program.
   Health Council secretary Bryn Williams said his staff was
``delighted that the queen mother should feel so strongly about the
closure. It shows there is a genuine concern among royalty.''

turned to Louisiana and ``The Kingfish.''
   The show loosely based on Huey P. Long's term as governor, opens
Thursday in Thibodaux, a Cajun town of 17,500 people.
   King, who wrote ``Whorehouse'' with Peter Masterson,
collaborated with former Texas legislator Ben Grant on ``The
Kingfish.'' It incorporates many of Long's speeches and a slideshow
which lets the audience see how much comedian John McConnell

second billing.
   ``They were terrific,'' said the comedian, who was on her way to

they didn't smell.''
   Miss Rivers walked all but unnoticed through a crowd of Metrozoo

   Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, the myopic,
bespectacled ski jump star of the Winter Olympics, has recovered
the lucky pair of skis that launched him to fame.
   The unlikely hero of the British team, who won international
recognition when he finished last in the 90-meter and 70-meter
jumps in Calgary, disclosed Wednesday he mislaid his favorite pair
of skis after his final jump at the Games, and has only just found
them.
   Edwards said a ski company had picked up the skis and taken them
back to West Germany. He said he hoped they would be forwarded to
Finland in time for a weekend meet there.
   ``I am taking up a spare pair just in case,'' Edwards said.
   He also said he wanted to to get down to serious business after
all the ballyhoo in Calgary.
   ``It will be nice to get back to my sport. I have enjoyed the
promotion work but I haven't had much sleep over the past couple of
days.''
   Edwards said his new-found fame could pose problems.
   His family, he said, is ``enjoying it at the moment but I think
there will come a time when they find it tiring. And it's worse for
my girlfriend, but we are just going to have to see how things go.''

   The party has fielded a presidential ticket for 40 years and in
recent elections has been on the ballot in about 20 states. It
pulled about 25,000 votes nationally in 1984.
   A party statement said the candidates will oppose use of

<HEAD>Super Tuesday Gets Mixed Review From Party Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana's Super Tuesday primaries won by
George Bush and Jesse Jackson drew mixed reviews Wednesday from
state Republican and Democratic leaders.
   ``We think Super Tuesday was wonderful,'' said Carolyn
Blue-Mikell, a spokeswoman for state Democrats. ``There was much,
much more attention paid to the voters, particularly here in
Louisiana.''
   In 1984, the Democratic candidates virtually ignored the state,
while in the months leading up to Tuesday's voting, the top
hopefuls came to Louisiana more than 100 times, she said.
   But state GOP Chairman Donald Bollinger questioned whether the
big event would be repeated.
   ``The Democrats thought they'd come out of the South with a
conservative Democrat that would make the Republicans look silly.
Where's their conservative?'' he said. ``I think in four years,
they won't want another Super Tuesday.''
   With reports in from 99 percent of the precincts, Bush had
83,585 votes, or 58 percent; former television evangelist Pat
Robertson had 26,227, or 18 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole tallied
25,602, or 18 percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 7,818, or 5
percent.
   Jackson had 219,960 votes, or 35 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. had 174,458, or 28 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis had 95,310, or 15 percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt tallied 66,894, or 11 percent.
   The results translated into 32 delegates for Jackson, 23 for
Gore, six for Dukakis and two for Gephardt. On the Republican side,
Bush nabbed 34 delegates with 7 uncommitted.
   Jackson, who aimed at expanding his ``Rainbow Coalition'' of
support across racial and ethnic lines, captured his second
straight victory in the Louisiana Democratic primary.
   ``We think he's been able to take his message to the people of
Louisiana,'' said New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, a key
Jackson supporter. ``His base of support has grown.''
   But Bud Courson, Gore's state coordinator, said that Jackson
should be worried about the Tennessee lawmaker's performance.
   ``We feel that a turnaround has come, and again looking further
down the road we feel that Sen. Gore can pull the Democratic Party
back together,'' said Courson.
   In the 4th Congressional District race to replace Gov.-elect
Buddy Roemer in the U.S. House, former Roemer aide Jim McCrery, a
Republican, and Democratic state Sen. Foster Campbell claimed spots
in an April 16 runoff.
   Roemer gave his backing to Stan Tiner, former editor of the
Shreveport Journal, who finished third.

<HEAD>Merger Off: Bid To Form United Opposition Collapses</HEAD>

   A bid to forge a united opposition to
the government of President Roh Tae-woo collapsed Wednesday, with
one faction accusing the other of sacrificing unity for power.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy, told a
news conference a merger with the rival Reunification Democratic
Party wasn't possible in time for the General Assembly elections,
expected to be held in April.
   Kim said he would not follow the lead of his counterpart, former
Reunification Democratic Party chief Kim Young-sam, and step down
from his party's leadership.
   ``The (Reunification Democratic Party) made unreasonable
demands, including my resignation,'' he said.
   Opposition supporters split ranks last year when both Kims ran
for president, dividing the anti-government vote and allowing Roh
to win the presidency without a plurality.
   Since then, public pressure has been on both to step down. Kim
Young-sam resigned from his party's leadership in February. The
resignation of both were seen as the key to merging the parties.
   Kim Dae-jung vowed to continue Wednesday as supporters shouted
``No resignation!'' But he offered a compromise, saying that the
parties should jointly support National Assembly candidates as an
interim measure.
   The Reunification Democratic Party rejected the proposal, saying
a merger is possible only if Kim Dae-jung resigns.
   ``This is a real betrayal of the people and democratic forces.
At this point, the only and largest obstacle to reunification is
Kim Dae-jung,'' the Reunification Democratic Party said in a
statement following Kim Dae-jung's news conference.
   Kim Dae-jung formed his party just prior to the presidential
elections when he and his supporters bolted from the larger
Reunification Democratic Party.
   At stake in the elections are 299 seats. Under a law adopted
Tuesday, 224 lawmakers must be picked in as many districts by
popular vote and 75 others under a proportional representation
system based on the total votes each party gets.
   Roh was elected on Dec. 16 in the first direct presidential
elections in Korea in 16 years.

   More than 250,000 people chanting
``Rajiv must go!'' crowded outside Parliament House on Wednesday
and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
midterm parliamentary elections.
   The rally and a day-long strike in the Indian capital were
sponsored by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party and the Lok Dal,
a rural-based party.
   Most shops in New Delhi were closed, but government offices,
banks and schools remained open. Traffic was normal.
   The capital's 35,000-strong police force and another 5,000
paramilitary troops were deployed to maintain peace. Police
spokesman Ravi Pawar said no violence was reported.
   Police said at least 250,000 people gathered for the rally.
Organizers claimed there were more than 500,000 participants.
   ``This mammoth gathering ... declares the Congress (Party)
government at the center to be anti-laborers, anti-farmers and
anti-rural,'' said a resolution adopted at the rally. Both parties
called upon opposition groups to unite and form a government in the
next general elections.
   Gandhi's Congress Party also faces a rally and strike sponsored
by two communist parties and leftist opposition groups on March 15.
   The next general elections are not due until December 1989,
although Gandhi could call them earlier. Gandhi's party holds 410
of the 544 seats in the governing lower house of Parliament.
   The opposition has blamed Gandhi's adminstration for failing to
control inflation and impose law and order in northern Punjab
state, where at least 400 people have died this year in violent
attacks by Sikh separatists.
   Gandhi's government also has been accused of corruption in its
arms purchases from foreign companies.

   Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to the
barber we must go.
   Workers at the Disneyland Hotel are now subject to a 31-year-old
dress code established for employees at the amusement park across
the street.
   Facial hair is a no-no, so even the late Walt Disney would have
had to shave his mustache to work at the hotel recently acquired by
Disney Co.
   Six of the seven dwarfs, Uncle Remus, Captain Hook and Pinocchio
toymaker Gepetto would all be renegades working in the real-life
world of Disney.
   And men aren't the only ones bound to conform with the company's
desire for a uniform ``wholesome'' look among employees.
   Women will have to abandon slacks, heavy makeup, gaudy jewelry
and wild hairdos. Men will have to get haircuts, shave, and cover
any tattoos.
   
   When Disney Co. assumed control of the hotel, its 1,600
employees fell under the dress code established for the Magic
Kingdom in 1957. Workers who rebel will be terminated.
   ``The reason that we are doing this is because the Disneyland
Hotel is becoming part of Disneyland Attractions, and we have an
appearance standard. ... It is associated with Disney and is
expected by our guests,'' said Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth.
   Disney officials are explaining the dress code to employees this
week, with compliance expected virtually immediately.
   But some hotel employees said they'll rebel, including engineer
Mike Searles, 40, who wears a handlebar mustache. ``I don't think
it's right, and I'm not going to compromise,'' he said.

   High school students cooked up what they
hope was the world's largest burrito to feed some of the city's
needy and maybe earn a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Creating the 1,492-foot Mexican specialty consumed 1,200
tortillas, 461 pounds of meat, 3,400 olives, 32 pounds of tomatoes,
14 pounds of onions, and 71 pounds each of salsa, sour cream and
lettuce, said Betty Swan, cafeteria manager at Lincoln High School.
   It took 400 students all of Tuesday morning to put together the
big burrito, she said.
   Two members of the Portland school board measured the burrito as
it wound around the school's gym. ``I consider this a very solemn
responsibility,'' said Steve Griffth, one of the board members.
   After the burrito was measured, it was divided among
representatives of various social service agencies to be given to
their clients.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Blasts U.S. Demand on Ending Military Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED AFTAB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan on Wednesday rejected a U.S. demand
that the Soviet Union halt military aid to the Afghan government as
soon as the United States stops aiding the Moslem insurgency.
   The dispute could become a major snag in U.N.-sponsored talks
aimed at ending nine years of fighting in Afghanistan and securing
the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of Afghanistan flatly opposed the
U.S. position, explained at a State Department briefing Friday,
that there must be a ``symmetrical cessation'' of U.S. and Soviet
military aid.
   Wakil said at a news conference that Soviet assistance could not
be compared to Western aid to ``terrorist groups.''
   He said Afghanistan had received Soviet assistance for ``68
years'' and would continue to do so ``even after the withdrawal of
Soviet troops.'' But he did not specify what kind of Soviet aid
Afghanistan expected to receive.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and are
helping the Marxist government battle the Moslem resistance.
   The United States is the main supplier of arms to the
guerrillas. Aid reportedly totaled about $700 million in 1987,
including the shoulder-fired ground-to-air Stinger missiles said to
have downed at least 200 Soviet and Afghan aircraft.
   Wakil said the U.S. demand was bringing a new issue into the
talks. He said another was Pakistan's attempt to link a Geneva
settlement to the formation of a broad-based transitional
government replacing the present Soviet-backed one in Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
   He said there had been no important developments in the talks
since ``concessions'' by Moscow and Kabul led to an agreement
Friday on the timetable and logistics of a Soviet withdrawal. U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez said this completed the main elements of a
settlement.
   Wakil accused Pakistan of ``trying to kill time'' and
maneuvering to ``push the Geneva negotiations toward a stalemate''
by holding out for an interim government. He said the chief
Pakistani representative, acting foreign minister Zain Noorani, had
returned ``empty-handed'' from weekend consultations in Islamabad
with the country's opposition leaders.
   Noorani said early last week that Pakistan would decide after
those consultations whether it was prepared to sign a settlement
with the Afghan government under President Najib, which it does not
recognize.
   Wakil, speaking as the latest round of the nearly 6-year-old
talks entered its second week, said the Afghan government would
continue to push for a speedy settlement. He also stressed that his
country was not setting a deadline after which it would leave
Geneva.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said last month Moscow would
bring home its troops starting May 15 if the settlement was signed
by March 15. Wakil said the start of the withdrawal depended on the
date of the signing and suggested the 60-day time span would be
retained.

<HEAD>Navy Defends Seawolf Attack Sub Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Wednesday defended the Pentagon's
planned Seawolf submarine, promising Congress that the latest
generation of attack subs would maintain U.S. undersea superiority
far into the 21st century.
   Vice Adm. Bruce DeMars, assistant chief of naval operations for
undersea warfare, said the SSN-21 Seawolf will have double the fire
power and be faster, quieter and more survivable than the SSN-688
Los Angeles class sub, which the Seawolf is expected to replace as
the nation's chief attack submarine.
   The SSN-21 Seawolf, which has been in the research and design
stage for six years, has been criticized by some lawmakers who fear
the sub is not advanced enough for the Soviet's planned successor
to their Akula attack sub.
   But DeMars dismissed that notion, telling the House Armed
Services sea power subcommittee that the Seawolf is ``the
foundation for far-term submarine superiority.''
   ``Repeated, objective analyses have concluded that Seawolf and
her sister ships will have three times the mission effectiveness of
the improved SSN-688 and will restore the commanding technological
and tactical margin which historically we have enjoyed over the
Soviets,'' Demars said.
   Last year, a House subcommittee tried to delay funds for the
project, but Congress restored the money. Navy officials have
warned that such a delay could severely damage the Seawolf program
and cause massive cost overruns.
   DeMars said the project now is on schedule and on budget.
   General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat Division and the Newport
News (Va.) Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., rival sub makers who
traditionally have split SCAN-688 contracts, have been researching
and designing the Seawolf for the Navy.
   Peter Yeo, an aide to Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., whose
district includes the Electric Boat shipyard at Groton, Conn., said
Seawolf proponents do not expect intense opposition again this year.
   Opponents ``made their case last year and it didn't fly,'' Yeo
said.
   The first SSN-21 contract is expected to be awarded later this
year, DeMars said. Delivery is planned for late 1994.
   The first Seawolf will cost $1.6 billion, and following subs
will be about $1 billion, the Navy estimates.
   DeMars said the Seawolf costs about 25 percent more than the
SSN-688, but predicted it would only be about 10 percent more over
its 30-year life span because it has much lower operating and
support costs.
   DeMars dismissed suggestions that the SSN-688 could be improved
significantly. He said since the program began in 1976, the Navy
has ordered 4,600 improvements, and there is simply no more room
left on the sub for new systems.
   He said a lack of room on the new SSN-688s has forced the Navy
to put bunks in the torpedo room and line some floors with canned
goods.
   Suggestions that the sub could be modified further are made by
``people who have obviously never been on these subs,'' DeMars said.
   Meanwhile, DeMars dismissed a scenario posed Rep. Charles E.
Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee, under which funds
for a Trident submarine would be delayed for a year and the savings
would go towards building more ships.
   ``To delay the Trident, which is our most survivable sub and
best deterrent, would be the wrong signal to send to both the
country and the Soviets,'' DeMars said.
   The Tridents, which carry long-range nuclear missiles, are made
by Electric Boat. The government orders one a year.

   Writers and editors of a dissident publication met
the ambassador to Afghanistan on Wednesday to protest the jailing
of a French journalist in Afghanistan on spying charges, one of the
dissidents said.
   Alexander Podrabinek, chief editor of the weekly
Express-Chronicle said in an interview with The Associated Press
that Ambassador Mohammadulah Subhani Safi met with six writers and
editors for about 30 minutes.
   The dissidents were protesting the conviction of French
journalist Alain Guillo, who on Jan. 4 was sentenced in Kabul to 10
years in prison.
   Reading from a copy of the statement handed to the ambassador,
Podrabinek said, ``incarceration for fulfilling his (Guillo's)
journalistic duty is possible only in a barbaric country that does
not value citizens' or human rights.''
   The group demanded the release of Guillo, 45, and said Afghan
authorities should allow him to leave the country.
   The ambassador accepted the group's statement but told its
members their reliance on Western media reports was giving them an
inaccurate picture of the situation in Afghanistan, Podrabinek said.
   Guillo, a filmmaker, was captured Sept. 12, 1987, after he
entered Afghanistan with guerrillas of the Afghan National Front.
   State-run Kabul radio said in announcing the sentence that
Guillo had entered Afghanistan nine times since 1980 ``to prepare
video films and cassettes, to carry out spying activities and to
stengthen relations with armed opposition groups.''

<HEAD>Gephardt Says Democratic Race Still On; Attacks Gore, Dukakis on
Trade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt on Wednesday
acknowledged his dismal Super Tuesday showing but insisted ``the
race is still on'' as he attacked two of his Democratic
presidential rivals on the trade issue central to his campaign.
   Standing outside a textile mill threatened with closure,
Gephardt said of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennesse, ``The bottom line is are they really for new
policies.''
   ``The fact is that Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Gore talk tough about
trade,'' Gephardt said, but they don't support policies that would
reduce the nation's trade deficit.
   Aides said Gephardt's comments were a signal that he's sticking
with trade as the central theme of his campaign.
   In the Super Tuesday polling, Gephardt won only his home state
of Missouri. Dukakis, Gore and Jesse Jackson shared the spoils in
the other Super Tuesday contests.
   Still, Gephardt vowed to stay in the race until the Democratic
National Convention in July, and said he had enough money to do
just that.
   ``The race is on,'' Gephardt said. ``I'm not where I'd like to
be but I think I have ample opportunity to make up lost ground and
get back in the middle of this race and to win.''
   Mike Nelson, a Gephardt aide, said campaign is less than
$100,000 in debt. ``Our fund-raising has not let up at any of the
dry points in the campaign,'' he said.
   ``We did not borrow, as others did, to run on Super Tuesday,''
Gephardt said. ``Maybe in retrospect we should have.''
   Gephardt made his comments at the first of a series of stops in
South Carolina, where he was campaigning for that state's caucuses
on Saturday. Deputy campaign manager Joe Trippi said Gephardt hopes
for a second place showing behind Jackson, who was born in South
Carolina.
   Gephardt planned a farm rally later in the day before flying to
Michigan and Illinois on Thursday.
   Illinois holds its primary Tuesday, and the Michigan Democratic
caucuses are March 26.
   But Gephardt's aides said the results in Illinois will be
muddled because of two favorite sons, Sen. Paul Simon and Jackson.
As a result, Gephardt has characterized the Michigan contest as the
next major Democratic showdown.
   He challenged Gore to a contest outside his rival's native South.
   ``Sen. Gore has to show he can win outside of his region,''
Gephardt said. ``He's going to have to go and show he can do well
in Illinois and Michigan and the other states in the North and
Northeast.
   ``Obviously it is clear I need to do well in Michigan,''
Gephardt said. ``When I get my message out to the voter I win.''
   The Missouri congressmen blamed his fourth place Super Tuesday
showing on a lack of money. Gephardt said he was only able to spend
$1 million on television, less than one-third of what was spent by
his rivals.
   Voters, he said, ``didn't hear what I had to say. That was the
problem.''
   ``The cutting question is can I get my message to the voters.''
   The textile plant where Gephardt spoke employs about 500 people,
and officials there said as many as 420 of those jobs could be lost
by next month.
   Plant manager Harold Simmons cited foreign competition and the
depressed local economy as reasons for the potential closure.

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson won Round 1, but Republican leaders
cautioned Wednesday that the results of precinct caucuses could
change at county-level meetings and the state convention.
   Grassroots organizing in Washington helped the former television
evangelist prevent Vice President George Bush from repeating here
the victories he recorded in the 16 states holding GOP primaries on
Super Tuesday.
   A sample of precincts taken by the Democrats showed
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with a slight lead over Jesse
Jackson, 40 percent to 38 percent.
   With 71 percent of the state's GOP precinct caucuses reporting,
Robertson led the Republicans with 39 percent, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole
had 26 percent and Bush was third with 24 percent.
   But ``no candidate won a clear majority of delegates
statewide,'' noted John Meyers, executive director of the state
Republican Party. ``This is a three-tiered system, and Super
Tuesday was just the first step.
   ``Now some coalitions will form. People have to start coming
together to get votes for the next two steps. Nobody has 50 percent
of the votes by themselves,'' he said.
   State Democratic Chair Karen Marchioro was blunter, saying she
would be ``very surprised if Robertson came out of this state with
any delegates.''
   But if the proportions held during the later steps of delegate
selection, Robertson would get 16 delegates, Dole 11, Bush 10, Kemp
3 and one delegate would attend the national convention uncommitted.
   Of Jackson's surprisingly strong showing behind Dukakis,
Marchioro said, ``Obviously, it's an organizational effort ... I
think also that people like his message _ and that's everywhere in
the state.''
   Official returns for the Democrats won't be known until next
week, after precinct leaders mail in their results.

Debt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson of the Federal
Reserve Board told congressmen Wednesday he opposes their plan for
an international body to lift some of the debt burden from Third
World countries.
   He praised Mexico's effort to exchange old debt for new bonds,
saying it was based on the market and gave creditor banks a chance
to adjust their holdings. Critics have called the results
disappointing.
   The Mexican plan has resulted in a reduction of Mexico's debt by
$1.1 billion, said Rodney Wagner, vice chairman of the credit poliy
committee at Morgan Guaranty Bank. His bank sponsored the plan.
   Mexico's debt is estimated at over $100 billion. Total Third
World debt is expected to reach $1.45 trillion by the end of this
year.
   Johnson was sharply challenged by both Democrats and Republicans
on the House Banking Committee. Two of its subcommittees sponsored
Wednesday's hearing.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., told Johnson to ``stop setting
up straw men and start working with us.'' Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky.,
asked how Johnson could say that the debt situation has improved
when the price of Third World debt has been dropping on the world
market.
   Bunning cited quotations that indicated Mexico's debt was
selling at 57 to 60 cents on the dollar last May and 48 to 52 cents
in November.
   Johnson replied that the market is thin, easily influenced by
relatively small deals. He said he expects it to turn upwards as a
result of willingness by Brazil and Argentina to come to agreements
with the International Monetary Fund. With Mexico, they are the
biggest Third World debtors.
   Bunning told Morrison he does not believe that putting public
money into a new international institution would solve the debt
problem, and that public money is already going into the Third
World through the fund and the World Bank. They are owned by 151
governments.
   Morrison was influential in getting a plan for a new world body
into the trade bill passed by the House. The proposed institution
would buy up Third World debt and package it for resale, giving
debtor countries at least some of the benefit of the discount.

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday identified a murder
victim whose dismembered body was found in a freezer as a woman
with a record of prostitution arrests.
   The body of Kimberly Hanlon, 30, a native of East Liverpool,
Ohio, was discovered Sunday by two teen-agers, police said. It was
not known when she died, said detective Maj. Tom dePolis.
   Identification was made Tuesday afternoon based on fingerprints
from the woman's arrest record, which included several
prostitution-related charges, dePolis said. The last arrest was in
August 1983, he said.
   Ms. Hanlon was last seen alive in early 1984 by a sister who
lives in north Tampa, dePolis said. The sister told police she
reported Ms. Hanlon missing in April 1984, dePolis said, but police
have been unable to find such a report.
   DePolis said Ms. Hanlon was dead when her body was dismembered
and placed in the freezer at the home of James Warren Bailey, who
has been charged by police with first-degree murder. Assistant
State Attorney Michael Benito said the state will seek a murder
indictment when the grand jury meets next week.
   Bailey was being held in the Hillsborough County Jail without
bond.
   Homicide Capt. Buzz Sawyer said police don't know exactly when
the woman was killed, but it apparently was between early 1984 and
mid-1985, when James Jr., 18, son of the suspect, said he first saw
the body in the freezer but told no one about it.
   Two teen-agers, the daughter of the suspect and a son of the
suspect's girlfriend, ignored admonishments to stay away from the
locked freezer on their back porch and pried it open Sunday. They
notified police.
   DePolis said the cause of Ms. Hanlon's death was being withheld
because of the investigation.
   While Bailey remains the prime suspect, dePolis said, ``we're
not positive who caused her death.''

   A man has been charged with criminally
negligent homicide after he allegedly suffered a seizure while
driving and struck and killed a pedestrian.
   Bevis B. Barker, 30, of Albany, pleaded innocent Tuesday to
charges of criminally negligent homicide and offering a false
instrument for filing. He was being held in lieu $25,000 bail.
   Barker allegedly suffered an epileptic seizure and lost control
of his car Dec. 7. The car struck and killed 85-year-old Christine
Towle.
   The seizure resulted from Barker's failure to take medication,
said Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel Dwyer. Barker was on
the way to a pharmacy to refill his prescription when the accident
happened, according to his lawyer, Joseph Zumbo.
   Dwyer noted that the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals, has ruled that if someone knows they have a disabling
disease and fails to take required medication to control it, ``they
are responsible for their actions under the theory of criminal

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces New Assignments For Two Air Force Generals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has nominated two Air Force
generals for promotions and new assignments, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
   Maj. Gen. Jimmie V. Adams has been nominated for a third star
and the rank of lieutenant general and elevation to the post of
vice commander of the Tactical Air Command, the Pentagon said.
   Adams, 51, is a native of Prichard, Ala., who is currently
serving as the commander of TAC's 1st Air Force. He will replace
Lt. Gen. James R. Brown, whom the Pentagon said Wednesday would
retire on Aug. 1 after more than 34 years of active service.
   Brown, 57, is a native of Bozeman, Mont., who has served as
TAC's vice commander since September 1986.
   The president also nominated Maj. Gen. Monte B. Miller to
receive his third star and to become the surgeon general of the Air
Force. Miller, 57, is a native of Independence, Mo., who is
currently serving as the command surgeon for the U.S. European
Command.
   Miller will replace Lt. Gen. Murphy A. Chesney as the Air
Force's top medical officer.
   The 60-year-old Chesney is retiring on Aug. 1 after more than 33
years of active service, the Pentagon said. Chesney is a native of
Knoxville, Tenn., who has served as surgeon general since August
1985.

   Early models of the Baby Buddy clip-on
pacifier holder are being recalled because of a potential choking
hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Wednesday.
   About 9,000 of the holders were distributed nationwide in 1986
and 1987, officials said. They sold for about $3.95 each.
   While no injuries have been reported involving the holders,
parents were urged to return them to the store where purchased for
a free replacement. When tested, the small bear figure separated
from the holder and thus could pose a choking hazard, officials
said.
   New model holders can be distinguished by the two round holes in
the back of the clip. There are no holes in the clip of the holders
being recalled.
   Recalled pacifier holders include those with a pink ribbon and
white bear, blue ribbon and bear, yellow ribbon and brown bear, red
ribbon and white bear and red ribbon and brown bear.
   Persons needing more information can contact Baby Buddies Inc.,
615 Jasmine Avenue North, Suite I, Tarpon Springs, Fla., at

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed grave concern
Wednesday that northern Ethiopia could face widespread starvation
because of fighting between government and insurgent forces.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said insecure conditions along roadways
in Tigray Province caused an 8,000-ton shortfall last month in
deliveries of emergency food supplies to the people in that area.
The goal was 20,000 tons.
   ``We are gravely concerned that expanded fighting will prolong
road insecurity, further complicating transportation difficulties
and leading to depletion of food stocks and widespread
starvation,'' Redman said.
   He attributed the insecure conditions to insurgent activity and
the inability by the Ethiopian government to control it.
   ``We deplore the militarization of roads in northern Ethiopia
and the politicization of the famine precisely at a time when the
people of the area are most vulnerable,'' he said.
   He said truck convoys are prepared to move when circumstances
permit. Food airlift operations sponsored by the United Nations
will continue, he said.
   Tigray province is one of a number of regions in Ethiopia facing
severe food shortages which were partly caused by a drought last
summer.
   According to U.S. estimates, the lives of between 6.7 million
and 7.2 million people are at risk. The U.S. contribution to an
international food relief effort is about 267,000 tons of food
valued at approximately $108 million.

<HEAD>Bush `Steamroller,' Dukakis Organization Spark Wins In Maryland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush never campaigned in
the state, but ``the Bush steamroller leveled Maryland'' anyway on
its way to a 16-state sweep of Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in the
Republican presidential race.
   In Super Tuesday's Democratic primary, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis exploited a superb organization and the backing of
Sens. Barbara Mikulski and Paul Sarbanes to leave Jesse Jackson a
distant second.
   Sarbanes easily won nomination for a third term with 86 percent
of the Democratic vote. He will face millionaire Republican
businessman Thomas Blair, a newcomer to politics who drew 46
percent of the GOP vote.
   Bush's tally of 53 percent or 103,899 votes was stronger than
the 48 percent Ronald Reagan polled in the 1980 GOP primary here,
when Bush had 41 percent, according to Republican officials.
   With all 1,574 precincts reporting, Dole finished with 32
percent or 62,721 votes, former TV evangelist Pat Robertson was
third with 12,891 votes or 7 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp
tallied 11,581 votes or 7 percent.
   ``The Bush steamroller leveled Maryland like the rest of the
South,'' Maryland GOP Executive Director Nelson Warfield said. ``I
think Bush did a little better than expected. The Dole camp had
great hopes.''
   Dukakis took 46 percent of the Democratic ballots with 237,389
votes, while Jackson had 150,129 votes or 29 percent.
   The voting was likely to give Dukakis 47 delegates and Jackson
20 delegates. Bush was expected to receive all 41 Republican
convention delegates.
   ``Dukakis was the best organized. It was a Maryland-oriented
campaign that used Maryland people to organize Maryland,'' said
John Willis, vice chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party.
   Willis said Jackson maintained his base from 1984, improving his
showing from 129,387 votes in 1984 to 150,129 votes in 1988.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, with 45,138 votes or 9 percent,
finished third among Democrats, followed by Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, 41,268 votes or 8 percent.

<HEAD>AIDS Linked To Upsurge In Tuberculosis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS may be causing an upsurge in tuberculosis in
many countries, a World Health Organization researcher said
Wednesday.
   Dr. Gary Slutkin said cases of tuberculosis have increased in
regions worst hit by AIDS, including the United States, where the
number of people with tuberculosis rose in 1986 for the first time
in modern history.
   About 1,000 health specialists from 20 countries are attending
the three-day First International Conference on the Global Impact
of AIDS. The meeting opened Tuesday.
   Slutkin, an epidemiologist with WHO's Global Program on AIDS,
said acquired immune deficiency syndrome might trigger symptoms of
tuberculosis in people already infected with the lung disease.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of
transmission include the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles.
   In normal circumstances, 95 percent of ``people who are infected
with the tuberculosis organism will go through life and never come
down with tuberculosis,'' the researcher told reporters later.
   ``We know that immunosuppression can bring tuberculosis out into
overt disease,'' he added.
   ``I think we should certainly expect to see increases in the
number of cases of tuberculosis in the next five years,'' Slutkin
said. ``In fact, it's almost certainly already occurring in many
countries.''
   Tuberculosis, or TB, is a contagious airborne infection that
mainly attacks the lungs, causing coughs that can produce blood.
   Once a worldwide scourge, TB is now relatively rare in
industrialized countries and easily treatable with antibiotics. But
the disease, known for centuries, is still rampant in developing
regions such as Southeast Asia and central Africa, which are poorly
equipped to deal it.
   Slutkin said an estimated 8 million to 10 million new cases of
TB occur worldwide each year and about 3 million people die of it.
   He did not identify all the countries where there has been a
rise in AIDS-related TB. But he said there were many, including the
United States and Central African nations.
   But he said there has been no rise in TB in Southeast Asia,
where AIDS is not yet prevalent.
   As of Feb. 29, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had
received reports of 54,723 Americans with AIDS, 30,715 of whom had
died.
   Slutkin said the number of reported TB cases in the United
States rose from 22,201 in 1985 to 22,768 in 1986 for the first
increase in U.S. records.
   He said the largest increases in TB in the United States
occurred in New York City, where the rate jumped by 50 percent to
about 2,200 between 1981 and 1986. He said there also have been
increases in TB rates in 25 states and in Washington.
   He said that in Africa, where AIDS is prevalent, 20 percent to
50 percent of TB patients tested positively for the AIDS virus.
That rate is three to 20 times higher than the rest of the
population.
   Asked if TB programs in Africa are adequate to cope with a surge
in cases due to AIDS, Slutkin said, ``No way.''

<TEXT>
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. poured money
into a television blitz and won nearly double the number of votes
cast for his closest Democratic opponent in Oklahoma's presidential
primary.
   With all 2,439 precincts reporting, Gore had 162,511 votes or 41
percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 82,565 votes or 21
percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 66,226 votes or 17
percent, and Jesse Jackson had 52,431 votes or 13 percent.
   Vice President George Bush had 78,273 votes or 38 percent;
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 72,991 votes or 35 percent; Robertson had
44,146 votes or 21 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 11,414
votes or 5 percent.
   Based on those results, Gore would win 23 of 46 delegates,
Gephardt would get 13, Dukakis 7, and Jackson 3. Bush would get 33
of the state's 36 GOP delegates, and Dole would get the remaining 3.
   Gephardt won the endorsement of three of Oklahoma's four
Democratic congressmen, and was locked in a virtual tie with Gore
in pre-election polls.
   But the Missouri congressman was outspent 3-1 by Gore in
Oklahoma, with much of the money going for television advertising,
said Lt. Gov. Robert S. Kerr, Gephardt's campaign co-chairman.
   Gore's biggest victory was in the 3rd congressional district,
where he campaigned in a stop at Muskogee in the final week of the
campaign. The nearby town of Gore is named for Thomas P. Gore, a
former Oklahoma senator who was a distant cousin of the candidate.
   ``Super Tuesday has proven that Al Gore is the candidate for
mainstream Democrats,'' said state Sen. Stratton Taylor,
co-chairman of the Gore drive in Oklahoma.
   Bush emphasized his Texas oil business background and visited
the state a day before the primary. Dole made five stops in
Oklahoma in the final week of the campaign, vising Oklahoma City
and Tulsa twice.

<HEAD>Army Investigates Bus Hijacking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army chief of staff was considering
ordering Israeli officers to carry weapons at all times following a
bus hijacking by terrorists who first overpowered four unarmed
officers, it was reported Wednesday.
   In Budapest, Hungary, a PLO official said the bus attack was not
aimed at taking hostages but at entering the Dimona nuclear
facility in Israel's Negev desert.
   Three Israeli civilians were killed in the Monday hijacking,
which was later claimed by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The three guerrillas were killed when Israeli police stormed the
bus, which was filled with workers headed to the Dimona plant.
   The military command confirmed that Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the
army chief of staff, was investigating the hijacking, but it
refused to provide any details.
   Before commandeering the bus, the guerrillas managed to seize a
car containing four unarmed army officers, drive past police
setting up a roadblock, keep ahead of a police van during an
eight-mile chase, shoot at passing cars and hijack the bus while
police looked on helplessly.
   Shomron said Monday that if the officers had been armed, they
might have prevented the attack. Their commander, Col. Zeev
Zachrin, sentenced each of the officers to 35 days in jail for
ignoring orders to carry their weapons outside the base.
   The daily Davar reported that Shomron was considering ordering
all officers to carry their weapons at all times anywhere in Israel.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar Lev defended police conduct in the
hijacking. The Israeli news agency Itim quoted him as saying
officers chasing the guerrillas could not fire at will because
there were passenger cars on the highway.
   The daily Haaretz said the police, who carried Israeli-made Uzi
submachine guns, were outgunned by the guerrillas who used Karl
Gustav and Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles which have a longer
range.
   The police managed to shoot a hole in the tire of the seized
car, Haaretz reported. The police parked their van 20 yards away
from the abandoned car and rushed for cover while the guerrillas
kept firing in all directions.
   Nearby, the driver of a bus carrying workers to the nuclear
plant heard the shooting and opened his doors to let the passengers
get away. Police stopped shooting as the passengers rushed out,
Haaretz reported.
   The guerrillas took over the bus, where 11 passengers remained
trapped. Survivors later testified the guerrillas killed at least
two of the hostages. The army is still investigating whether police
or guerrillas shot the third victim.
   Hekmat Zaid, chief of the PLO mission in Budapest, told
reporters Wednesday, ``The aim of the Palestinian commando action
... was not to take hostages, the plan of the PLO's armed men was
to enter the strictly guarded complex by overpowering the bus that
carried the workers of the Dimona nuclear center.''
   Zaid said the attack was ``only aimed against workers in a
military establishment, an action against the Israeli enemy,''
adding ``the fact is Israel refuses international supervision over
its Negev nuclear station.''
   ``We will increase our military action against Israel,'' he said.

   China has agreed in principle to accept Peace
Corps volunteers, Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian said today.
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Wu said details of the
program are still to be worked out, but that ``China has adopted a
positive attitude on this matter.''
   He called it ``an agreement in principle.''
   There was no immediate public comment from the Peace Corps, the
27-year-old volunteer agency operating grass-roots aid programs in
64 of countries.
   An agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
corps had ``been interested for some time in seeing this. China
could benefit from our programs.''
   Wu's announcement came during a question-answer session after a
speech at the National Press Club. He also welcomed a Reagan
administration decision to lift sanctions on sales of new high
technology to China because it is satisfied that country is not
selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz informed Wu during a meeting
Tuesday afternoon that the restrictions would no longer apply.
   For years, the United States has continuously increased the
types of high technology products China could purchase from
American companies. To protest the missile sales, however, the
administration froze that process last autumn.
   ``We are encouraged by Chinese statements and actions regarding
Iran's acquisition of Chinese anti-ship missiles, Silkworms,''
State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   ``We have therefore decided to resume the export control
liberalization process for China,'' he said.
   During a 40-minute meeting with President Reagan on Tuesday, Wu
also said his country would not stand in the way of a United
Nations resolution calling for an arms embargo against Iran, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The United States has been trying for months to line up support
on the U.N. Security Council for an arms embargo against Iran
designed to stop the 7-year-old Iran-Iraq War. The ban on weapons
sales would be the second installment of a U.N. resolution last
July calling for a truce in the war.
   U.S. officials who estimated in recent weeks that China sold $1
billion in weapons to Iran in 1987 said they did not expect China _
a permanent member of the U.N. body _ to veto the arms ban.
Fitzwater's report on Wu's meeting with Reagan appeared to solidify
that view.
   The spokesman quoted Wu as saying ``if the overwhelming majority
of the Security Council believed it should be adopted, including
the arms embargo, that they are in favor, that there was no
difficulty on their part in terms of that second resolution.''
   The final step in the resolution would be Soviet support. U.S.
officials have said Moscow appears willing to lift its objections
to an arms embargo if it is accompanied by a short period of
further diplomacy _ one last effort to get Iran to agree to a
cease-fire.
   Fitzwater said of Wu's assurances, ``It was our reaction, the
president's reaction, that this was a very positive sign, a very
strong expression of support and one, frankly, one we hope the
Soviet Union would emulate.''
   Of all the weapons China has sold to Iran, Silkworm anti-ship
missiles used in attacks on tankers in the Persian Gulf have caused
the most consternation to neutral countries.
   The United States repeatedly protested to China about the sales
last year, but since last autumn, U.S. officials have said they
believe the Chinese are o longer sending the missiles to Iran.
   ``To the best of our information, they have not delivered any
missiles since then,'' Fitzwater said. ``They have indicated they
are not sending missiles to the gulf, and we don't have any
information to the contrary.''
   While noting that China still remains a major supplier of
conventional arms, he said, ``we think the fact that we have not
detected any new missile shipments and their general attitude
toward the Iran-Iraq War and the U.N. resolution _ that those are
very hopeful signs.''

<TEXT>
   When Iowa voters spoke they gave their
blessing and momentum to presidential candidacies of Bob Dole and
Richard Gephardt, but the day after Super Tuesday it looked like
the rest of country wasn't listening.
   The big Iowa winners were big Super Tuesday losers, while two of
the biggest Iowa losers _ Vice President George Bush and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee _ were riding high.
   Gore had denounced the Iowa caucuses as ``sort of like a
roulette game _ it's not democracy in action.''
   Iowa caucus-goers responded in kind, giving the Tennessee
senator less than 1 percent of their votes. They gave more support
to Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who was insisting he was not a
candidate.
   Iowans weren't much kinder to Bush. He finished third in the
Republican caucuses, not only far behind Dole, but trailing an
embarrassing distance behind former television evangelist Pat
Robertson.
   Exactly a month later, Super Tuesday weighed in and Bush beat
Dole and Robertson in 16 out of 16 Republican primaries. On the
Democratic side, Gephardt carried only his home state of Missouri,
while Gore carried six states. Paul Simon, the other Democrat
treated well by Iowans, was waiting for one last shot at survival
in his home state of Illinois.
   So, the question arises, is this it for Iowa?
   ``Al Gore may have demolished the theory that you've got to run
in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said White House Chief of Staff Howard
H. Baker Jr. ``He is a very credible candidate and he did not make
a major effort in Iowa and New Hampshire.''
   ``It looks like the allure of the land of corn wears off by the
time you get to the hominy grits,'' said John Buckley, press
secretary to Rep. Jack Kemp, who failed to excite Iowa voters _ or
those anywhere else.
   But Iowa still has its defenders.
   Phil Roeder, spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party, said the
Super Tuesday results simply ``addressed one of the biggest
criticisms a lot of people had of Iowa, that it had too much
influence.''
   ``We learned last night that Iowa certainly is not the beginning
and the end of the campaign, it's just the beginning and a lot can
change once things get rolling,'' said Roeder.
   Nelson Polesby, a professor of political science at the
University of California at Berkeley and an expert on the
nominating process, was another dissenter from the theory that
Iowa's importance was diminished by the Super Tuesday vote.
   ``It seems to me they (Iowa and New Hampshire) framed the
alternatives for Super Tuesday quite successfully,'' said Polesby.
``I think what it demonstrates is that front-loading is terribly
important, having money ahead of time is terribly important.''
   Polesby said one might as well write off Super Tuesday since
that Southern-generated event did not produce the desired result of
a conservative front-runner.
   As well as Gore did on his home ground, the strong dose of
Southern events proved just as beneficial to two liberals _
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   David Keene, who was a Dole political adviser until he had a
falling out with campaign chairman William Brock, said having a
small state or two at the start of the process is a good thing.
   ``Guys without as much money who are not as well known can test
and break through against a front-runner,'' he said. ``It gives you
a ticket to the game. It doesn't necessarily and shouldn't
necessarily mean you're going to win the game.''

   Soldiers shot three Arabs dead and wounded 13
in the occupied lands Wednesday, which the PLO named ``Martyrs
Day'' for the scores of Palestinians killed by Israeli bullets or
beatings, army and Arab reports said.
   Arabs paralyzed commerce in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a
general strike. Protesters pelted soldiers with rocks, bottles and
firebombs. The outlawed Palestinian flag flew in dozens of
locations.
   Israel's divided coalition government refused to vote on whether
to endorse a U.S. peace plan designed to end the violence that
began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967.
   ``Many missed opportunities may be forgiven but a missed peace
is unforgiveable,'' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said in
Parliament after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, his conservative
rival, headed off a vote in the 10-member inner Cabinet.
   Wednesday's deaths brought to 87 the number of Arabs confirmed
killed by Israeli gunfire or beatings in three months of violence.
U.N. figures put the toll at 91, including five who died of tear
gas inhalation.
   ``Martyrs Day'' was called in a Palestine Liberation Orgnization
leaflet distributed last week. The strike closed shops, halted
public transport and kept most of the 110,000 Arabs who work in
Israel away from their jobs, the army reported
   In clashes near Qalqilya, a West Bank village 35 miles northwest
of Jerusalem, armored personnel carriers fired pebbles at
protesters with a newly developed riot-control device, Israel radio
reported. It said the gravel-firing gun was used this week for the
first time.
   Associated Press photographer Anat Givon saw five soldiers grab
an Arab teen-ager by the neck and drag him down the street after a
clash in Al Amari refugee camp near Ramallah on the West Bank.
Troopers slammed a woman who tried to intervene into a wall.
   At Silwad, 10 miles northeast of Ramallah, troops opened fire on
about 200 protesters who built street barricades, surrounded
soldiers and stoned a passing Israeli car, an army spokesman said.
   He said Mohammed Othman Farris, 18, died of a bullet wound in
the back and another Palestinian was wounded in the leg.
   Villagers told an AP reporter that a car taking Farris to a
hospital was held up at an army checkpoint for half an hour and
soldiers took the wounded man away. They said he was bleeding from
the mouth and they later were told Farris had died.
   Jamil Hijazi, 19, was killed by gunshots to the chest in nearby
Turmas Ayya villlage, the army and Ramallah Hospital officials said.
   Bassem Al Badarin, 25, was shot in the heart in Samu village
near Hebron, the Palestine Press Service and Arabic daily Al Quds
said.
   Ramallah Hospital officials said they treated two other Arabs
from Samu and nearby Yatta for serious chest wounds and a
Palestinian from Bir Zeit, near Ramallah, was admitted with a leg
wound, the officials said.
   In the Fara refugee camp near Nablus, soldiers fired on hundreds
of Arabs who were throwing stones, bottles and metal pipes,
wounding seven, the army reported. Most were wounded in the legs,
hands and rib area, said officials at Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   They said a Palestinian from Masha, a village 15 miles west of
Nablus, was treated for a gunshot wound in the left leg. Officials
at Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus said a Palestinian from Jenin, 20
miles north, was shot in the shoulder.
   Peres and his center-left Labor Party had tried to force a vote
in the decision-making inner Cabinet on the U.S. peace plan.
   ``Why did we reject the outstretched hand of peace because of
imaginary fears?'' he asked in Parliament after the attempt was
defeated by Shamir and his right-wing Likud bloc.
   Shamir said on army radio: ``I think we are forbidden to give in
to pressure and accept this initiative. We are also forbidden to
give up by not fighting, by withdrawing from this battlefield
without presenting our position.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, presented the plan to Arab
and Israeli leaders on a trip last week, and asked Shamir to bring
Israel's response to Washington for talks with President Reagan on
March 14. Labor had hoped to commit Shamir to accept it before he
left.
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said the prime minister
``opposed most of the ideas'' in the U.S. plan and would try to get
it changed.

   In ``lavalava'' sarongs,
beneath the thatched roofs of a South Seas hotel, and hours behind
the rest of the electorate, Samoans gathered for their moment in
the Super Tuesday sun.
   No negative ads filled the airwaves. No TV anchorman or
presidential candidate descended. And no exit pollster tapped the
wisdom of the voters, all 36 of them. But an upset was in the
making.
   The local Democratic chairman had urged those attending the
party caucus, choosing a three-member delegation to the Democrats'
convention, to vote ``uncommitted.''
   ``We would rather wait to see where the trend is going ... who
doesn't make the cut,'' said Chairman Utu R.M. Sinagege.
   But American Samoa Gov. A.P. Lutali hailed Masschusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis for his virtues as a fiscal manager, and American
Samoa's congressional delegate, Fofo I.F. Sunia, endorsed another
presidential hopeful, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. By the
time the party faithful left the Rainmaker Hotel, at the foot of
lushly green Rainmaker Mountain, Dukakis had one delegate, Gephardt
another, and ``uncommitted'' the third.
   The local party chiefs had scheduled the caucus for Super
Tuesday to gain national attention for their Pacific island
territory, which in Republican eyes does not even rate convention
delegates.
   Polls were already closed in most of the 20 Super Tuesday states
when the three dozen Democrats, many clad in traditional, brightly
hued ``lavalavas,'' assembled here in Pago Pago, six time zones
behind the U.S. East Coast and 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   It was a light turnout _ only one-tenth of those eligible.
National Committeeman Glenn Jones blamed it on the fact that the
territory of 37,500 people has no electoral votes in November's
presidential election.
   But Samoans are deeply interested, nonetheless, in what goes on
in Washington.
   Most of their local budget comes from the U.S. Treasury, and
government welfare payments, made to Samoans on the U.S. mainland,
often find their way here to the home islands, where few jobs are
available beyond the government and two tuna canneries.
   The Samoans' interest apparently is not reciprocated. Party
officials said Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore had pledged to call, but
didn't. Jesse Jackson sent a box of campaign buttons, but Sinagege
said his son sold them to classmates for about 50 cents _ total.
   The lapel strategy may have had an impact, however. Fourteen of
the 36 votes went to Dukakis, eight to Gephardt, 12 were
uncommitted, and the final two went to the man on the buttons.

<HEAD>Angola Says South African Troops Moving North After 180 Rebels
Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South African troops are moving farther
north into Angola to support rebel forces pounded in a three-day
battle this week, government officials said this week.
   The officials said troops loyal to the Marxist government killed
180 UNITA rebels and captured large quantities of South
African-supplied equipment in the battle near Cuemba in central Bie
province.
   ``This was a major battle and we expect more fighting in the
area,'' said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He said the battle ``shows the South African incursion
into Angola is still moving north in conjunction with rebel
forces.''
   Angolan government radio said government troops destroyed two
South African-built armored personnel carriers and captured another
along with South African arms and ammunition.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
also is backed by the United States.
   The action was the farthest north UNITA has engaged government
troops since it began driving them out of their southeastern
strongholds when South African troops entered the area in October
to help the rebels repulse a government offensive.
   Cuemba is 375 miles north of Angola's border with South
African-ruled South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   In a statement in Lisbon on Wednesday, UNITA said rebels were
enagaged in heavy fighting around Cuemba. It said guerrillas killed
11 Angolan soldiers and four Cubans on Monday in an attack on the
nearby town of Catabola.
   Three weeks earlier, UNITA overran Munhango, 40 miles east of
Cuemba.
   Both Cuemba and Munhango are along the east-west Benguela
railroad, southern Angola's vital transport link to landlocked
Zaire and Zambia. UNITA has targeted the railroad during its
12-year bush war to press President Jose Eduardo dos Santos'
government for a power-sharing accord.
   ``Our troops are holding Cuemba,'' the official said.
   Angolan Defense Minster Gen. Pedro Maria Tonha said Monday in
Lubango, capital of the southern province of Huila, that to take
the strategic city of Cuito Cuanavale, South African forces
fighting with UNITA ``have resorted to bombardment of our positions
with long-range artillery because of the failure of their air
attacks on the city.''
   Angolan authorities announced last month their forces fought off
the third major South African-UNITA offensive against the garrison
city of Cuito Cuanavale in three months.
   Dos Santos said an estimated 7,000 South African troops were in
position around the city, with another 2,000 South African soldiers
scattered around south-central Cunene province.
   South Africa acknowledged in November it was sending troops into
Angola to aid UNITA and has reported casualties among its forces in
Angola in the past two weeks.
   In December and January, the U.N. Security Council called for a
total withdrawal of South African forces from Angolan territory.
   The Angolan officials confirmed Cuban support troops are in
place in the southern war zone but remain behind Angolan front line
positions. ``They are there if needed,'' one official said.
   Cuba has said its has 40,000 troops in Angola and has agreed
with the government to withdraw the Cubans from Angola when South
Africa pulls out of the country, stops aiding UNITA and begins
implementing a U.N. plan for Namibian independence.
   South Africa has demanded a Cuban withdrawal first.

   The Navy said Wednesday it would launch a new
guided-missile cruiser later this month in Bath, Maine.
   The USS Normandy, a so-called Aegis cruiser, will be launched
during ceremonies on March 19 at the Bath Iron Works, the service
said in a statement.
   Retired Army Brig. Gen. John S.D. Eisenhower will deliver the
principal speech.
   The Normandy, named after the massive Allied landings in France
that led to the defeat of Germany in World War II, is 567 feet
long, 55 feet wide and displaces 9,500 tons.
   The Aegis cruisers are considered the most advanced air-defense
ships in the world, carrying a variety of missiles and gun systems
for use against enemy aircraft and a wraparound radar system that
allows them to ``see'' in all directions at once.

   Michael Dukakis won the lion's share of
delegates at Idaho's Democratic caucuses, but Jesse Jackson did
surprisingly well in what Gov. Cecil Andrus saw as a protest vote.
   ``There are a lot of people who are turned off by the so-called
establishment in any way,'' said Andrus, who remains an uncommitted
delegate and urged others to remain uncommitted.
   ``In this case, that is to his (Jackson's) benefit,'' Andrus
said.
   In a state with only a tiny minority population, Jackson waged a
limited campaign but captured four of the state's 18 uncommitted
delegates to the national convention. The Massachusetts governor
won eight delegates, and six will go to the convention uncommitted.
   Party officials were pleased with the turnout, which in most
cases was sharply higher than four years ago when the county caucus
process was used for the first time.
   In Ada County, two caucuses that drew less than 800 people
between them four years ago attracted about 1,700 Tuesday night.
   Former governor John Evans, who was state chairman for Dukakis,
said he felt Dukakis was gaining recognition for his
accomplishments, including the economic revitalization of his state.
   ``That's the message: it can be done,'' said Evans.

   Glenda Jackson and Christopher Plummer have
avoided broken legs and other major disasters traditionally
associated with the staging of ``Macbeth.''
   But their Broadway-bound production of Shakespeare's
blood-soaked tragedy hasn't been without problems.
   Five weeks before the play arrives at the Mark Hellinger Theater
in New York for a 12-week run, the original director, Kenneth
Frankel, has been dismissed and new sets and costumes at a cost of
$250,000.
   ``We decided we had to make some moves,'' said co-producer Garth
Drabinsky of Toronto, owner of the Cineplex Odeon movie theater
chain.
   The new director, Robin Phillips of Canada's Stratford Festival,
agreed to rescue the production but doesn't want his name on the
program.
   There also are rumors of strife between the two stars _ although
they appeared amiable enough upon arrival March 8 in Toronto for 16
performances at the O'Keefe Center, where $1 million in advance
sales set a box office record.
   ``When we found Robin was free, it was a miracle,'' said
Plummer, a Toronto native and Hollywood veteran who earned critical
acclaim for his Iago in a 1982 Broadway production of ``Othello.''
   ``It saved our necks,'' he added.
   ``We have been working almo  Critics said Frankel, an off-Broadway
Obie award winner, lacked
a cohesive vision of what ``Macbeth'' was all about.
   Miss Jackson is tackling Lady Macbeth for the first time and
finds passionate, erotic bonds between the murdering king and his
ambitious wife.
   ``Undoubtedly part of the attraction each has for the other is
they both have largish sexual appetites. I've never thought that
Lady Macbeth breathed life into a man of straw _ what would be
attractive to her in a man like that?
   ``It was a time when people were infinitely more passionate than
they are now ... they see no alternative to what they are doing,''
she added.
   ``The challenge always is to make it clear to an audience that
Shakespeare is about real people. He's probably the most
contemporary dramatist there is. I'm sure there's a Mr. and Mrs.
Macbeth walking around now.''
   Working with Plummer for the first time, Miss Jackson repeated
her old saw that it's not necessary to like fellow actors in order
to put on a play.
   Asked if he had done anything to make his co-star dislike him,
Plummer smiled and said: ``I constantly do.''
   She chimed in: ``This is true.''
   The production will be seen at Boston's Colonial Theater from
March 22 to April 3 and the Shubert Theater in New Haven April 5-10
before one week of previews in New York. Opening night is April 21.

   Michael Dukakis was a big winner on Super
Tuesday and a hit in his ancestral country on Wednesday, picking up
the sort of television and newspaper coverage reserved for a native
son.
   ``Dukakis Triumphs, All Consider Him A Certain President,''
screamed a second edition banner headline in Messimvrini, a
conservative daily newspaper.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, won Democratic primary
victories in his home state, Florida, Texas, Rhode Island and
Maryland and caucuses in Idaho and Hawaii.
   ``The name Dukakis has a great deal of recognition and the fact
that he is a Greek-American draws intense interest here,'' said
Messimvrini's chief editor, Giorgos Bertsos.
   Dukakis' showing also was one of the top items on the state-run
TV news.
   The conservative afternoon daily 24 Hours, a national tabloid,
ran a large color picture of a smiling Dukakis on its front page.
The left-wing Eleftherotipia said he was ``the main winner among
the Democrats.''
   The Dukakis campaign has been closely followed by the Greek
press and many newspapers have run long interviews with the
candidate.
   On Tuesday, Messimvrini ran four pages on the Super Tuesday
contest under the headline ``The Test of Victory,'' with color
pictures of Dukakis taking up two pages in the middle of the
newspaper.
   Wednesday's left-wing newspapers also had in-depth reporting of
the Democratic and Republican campaigns.
   ``Dukakis and Bush Advancing Steadily,'' headlined the left-wing
afternoon daily Proti above a half-page story.
   Many newspapers played down the fact that Dukakis had split the
vote with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson in the South.
Instead, they highlighted the governor's big wins in Texas and
Florida.

<HEAD>New Clean Air Act Could Cost 600,000 Jobs, Business Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill revising the Clean Air Act most likely
would cost the economy $32 billion and 300,000 to 600,000
manufacturing jobs, a business group told Congress on Wednesday.
   In the worst case the cost could reach $73 billion and a million
jobs, about 5 percent of the nation's manufacturing payrolls, the
group said. The minimum cost was put at $14 billion, without a jobs
estimate.
   ``We can't afford to be exposing ourselves to 30 to 70 billion
(dollars) a year and expect to be part of the solution to the trade
problem'' characterized by a $170 billion annual trade deficit,
said David M. Roderick, chairman of USX Corp., in presenting a
study of the air pollution bill approved by the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee.
   The bill would require tighter pollution controls in several
areas, including new controls on the precursors of acid rain from
old power plants, and stricter requirements for motor vehicles.
Passage is by no means certain.
   Roderick, who is chairman of the environment committee of the
Business Roundtable, an organization of chief executives of large
companies, told a news conference, ``A very high proportion of the
money wouldn't do anything.
   ... It would be the least cost-effective of all our nation's
environmental laws'' as well as the most costly.
   He said Congress should design measures targeted to areas of the
country that don't meet clean-air standards.
   Roderick used an example from his company's steel-making
subsidiary, U.S. Steel Corp., saying the bill would ``go after your
coke ovens in a horrendous way, it would go after your blast
furnaces in a horrendous way ... you could not justify retrofitting
some of those plants.''
   Though the company would have to spend $1.5 billion to $2
billion on compliance, some ovens and furnaces would be closed and
``we would import more semi-finished product.'' One of the
company's most efficient plants found it would have to raise prices
$25 to $40 a ton or roughly 6 percent to 8 percent.
   The company only recently resumed exports, which earn profits of
5 percent to 8 percent on sales. ``This would just wipe that out,''
Roderick said.
   As for weaker steel companies, some of them operating under
protection of the bankruptcy laws, ``they're dead; they're
history,'' Roderick said.
   Manufacturing industry spending of $6 billion a year on air
pollution control would rise to $26 billion, the study said.
   The study by R.M. Dowd & Co., a Washington consulting firm,
pulled together findings from trade association and government
agency studies. No estimates were possible for 22 of 43 provisions
in the bill, Roderick said.
   Those omitted costs included costs to auto makers and their
customers, already paying by some estimates $1,600 a car for
pollution control equipment. ``The technology doesn't exist'' to go
further. ``How are you going to estimate the costs?'' Roderick said.
   Richard Ayres, chairman of the Clean Air Coalition of
environmental and other groups, said Roderick's study was ``An
elaborate, thick stack of back-of-the-envelope calculations ...
probably two to four times too high.''
   ``There is no estimate given here of the benefits'' of the bill,
Ayres said, adding that in his opinion a cleaner environment and
less respiratory disease would be worth $32 billion a year.
   Among estimates from the study of spending requirements:
   _By industry as a whole except utilities, $10.4 billion on new
controls of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, raw materials for
transformation into acid rain, and on compounds that help form
ozone.
   _By utilities, $9 billion on additional control of sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
   _By industry, another $3.7 billion limiting emissions of highly
toxic chemicals.
   _By petroleum refiners, $4.3 billion in changing fuel
characteristics.
   _By local governments, $1.3 billion in auto pollution
inspections.
   Some expenditures like inspections would be necessary even if
Congress does nothing. The Environmental Protection Agency has
estimated its plans for ozone control could cost $8 billion a year.
   The study's $32 billion estimate was not out of line with
earlier studies, which made different assumptions and omitted some
provisions included by Dowd.
   EPA estimated the bill would cost $16 billion to $24 billion in
addition to the $8 billion the agency's plan would require. The
Congressional Research Service estimated $14 billion to $28
billion. The Senate committee report estimated costs at $16.87
billion.

<TEXT>
   The 50th anniversary of Austria's
annexation to Nazi Germany finds Austria's youth beginning to
question the country's past, the validity of democratic
institutions today and prospects for the future.
   Political leaders, analysts and historians have called on
members of the World War II generation to teach Austria's youth
about the events that led up to the Anschluss on March 11, 1938,
and Austria's involvement in the war and the Holocaust.
   Over the two years since the first disclosures that President
Kurt Waldheim had covered up his service with the Nazi army, a
nationwide debate has raised political awareness among Austria's
youth and often pitted young against old.
   In a strongly hierarchical society that has traditionally ducked
conflict, youth began in the late 1970s to question the maxims they
inherited from their parents.
   These included the silent consensus of postwar generations to
keep quiet about the war and not to provoke open conflict.
   For some young people, the Waldheim debate has sharpened their
growing political awareness and unwillingness to accept things just
as they are.
   Many young Austrians who voted for Waldheim in 1986 now say they
made a mistake in voting for him and in failing to inform
themselves about the candidates.
   A panel of historians appointed by the Austrian government
issued a report last month that said Waldheim was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities when he was a lieutenant in the
Balkans, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent
them. It left open the question of whether he was guilty of any
crime.
   Whole generations were not taught about the 1930s and 1940s in
school. Even many Austrians under 30 say that by the time they
finished school their history teachers had reached only the end of
World War I.
   By contrast, many teen-agers today receive comprehensive and
objective lessons on the events that led to World War II and the
Holocaust from teachers young enough to be distant from those
events.
   Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told foreign journalists
recently that his teen-age children ``do not find it embarrassing
or painful'' to discuss the war years because they are not
preoccupied with their own involvement.
   Austria's youth ``has read more, traveled more, is more open,
more liberal and more tolerant'' than earlier generations, said
Josef Figl, head of an 11,000-member Catholic student group.
   Sociologist Silvio Lehmann said the level of education rose
tremendously in the 1970s and 1980s, increasing interest in
politics. He cited protests against the Zwentendorf nuclear
facility, which led to a 1978 referendum in which Austrians voted
against nuclear power.
   In December 1984, demonstrators clashed with police in Hainburg
on the Danube to protest a planned hydroelectric plant
environmentalists say would destroy a unique natural landscape.
   The clash shocked and outraged many Austrians in a country where
confrontations with authorities have been rare since the street
battles between Socialists and conservatives in the 1930s.
   Memories of that violence prompted all political parties to bury
their differences after World War II in public consensus and
reconciliation.
   Psychologist Erwin Ringel, author of ``The Austrian Soul,'' said
that after the war Austrians ``threw themselves into rebuilding the
country to avoid rebuilding the soul.'' He said Waldheim symbolizes
that suppression of the past.
   Robert Koschin, 27, of Innsbruck, said the younger generations'
growing interest in the past has reversed the parent-child role.
   ``The children are giving their parents their experiences and
knowledge,'' making older generations more willing to discuss the
``blocking'' of the past, he said.
   Many Austrians perceive their country as Adolf Hitler's first
victim, but many leading Nazis were Austrians.
   As in West Germany, Austria's parents have struggled to shelter
their children from the deprivation they knew immediately after the
war, showering them with the benefits of a rebuilt consumer society.
   Now the economy and an extensive social welfare system are
beginning to falter, with 6.7 percent of youth unemployed and much
of the state-owned industry running heavy deficits.
   ``It is depressing for a generation that was born into having
everything to have to fight for things that were taken for
granted,'' Koschin said. ``It is the first time people are
confronted with having to do something themselves.''

<HEAD>Secret Drug Case Tape Talks of `Fidel' Payoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The alleged chief of a smuggling ring that imported
cocaine through Cuba was ordered held without bond Wednesday after
prosecutors played a tape of the defendant saying ``the money went
in Fidel's drawer.''
   Reinaldo Ruiz, 50, a Cuban-born U.S. citizen, was indicted along
with 16 others last month on charges of flying drugs from Colombia
through Cuba and other Caribbean islands.
   It was the third Miami drug indictment involving alleged Cuban
connections since October.
   On a secretly recorded videotape played for U.S. Magistrate
William Turnoff during a pre-trial detention hearing, Ruiz is heard
telling an informant, ``I am the only one that has connections'' in
Cuba.
   Then, apparently referring to payoffs, Ruiz states, ``The money
went in Fidel's drawer.''
   Ruiz never identified Cuban President Fidel Castro as the
``Fidel'' he was referring to, and prosecutors refused to comment
on the statement.
   Castro has strenuously denied any involvement in drug smuggling.
   But last month's indictment of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega here alleges the Cuban leader mediated a drug
payoff dispute between the general and the Medellin Cartel, a
Colombian ring responsible for up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine
imports.
   And an indictment in October charged that another drug ring
routinely used Cuba as a waystation for cocaine shipments.
   No Cuban officials were indicted in the most recent case. But
prosecutors say the conspirators used a Cuban military base to ship
drugs, and promised an informant an escort of Cuban coast guard
vessels for a cocaine shipment.
   The indictment accuses Ruiz of heading the smuggling ring which
allegedly imported cocaine from Colombia through Cuba, Haiti and
the Bahamas to Mexico and the United States.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Mulvihill asked that Ruiz be held
until trial, contending he is a danger to the community and may
flee. Ruiz faces trafficking charges and a continuing criminal
enterprise count that carries a maximum life sentence.
   Turnoff agreed to hold Ruiz, over objections of defense attorny
Alvin Entin.
   ``The government appears to have a very strong case,'' said
Turnoff.
   Besides Ruiz, the tapes showed a woman named Rosa and Ruiz's son
Rubin, who is also a defendant in the case. A cooperating informant
was out of camera during the part of the tape shown in court.

   Italian designers are coming on strong at
the fall-winter collections, scoring with new ideas that include
waist-skimming jackets, pants and skirts.
   The mood is buoyant as store buyers jostle to place their orders.
   Before the shows started, there was fear that the low buying
power of the dollar would adversely affect orders. And there were
also considerable jitters regarding all the publicity given
recently to the fantasy fashions of Paris-based designer Christian
Lacroix.
   The Italians were worried that the success of their more sober
type of elegance would be compromised. But their fear of this
two-headed bogeyman appears to have been unjustified. And what's
more, the sun has shone from a cloudless blue sky throughout,
putting everybody in a good mood.
   Laura Biagiotti, the designer who lives and works out of a
medieval castle nestling in the countryside outside Rome, showed
styles that were perfect for an elegant castle dweller.
   There were soft cashmere ``horse blankets,'' ideal for keeping
out the chill along the ramparts. They wrapped up comfy
sweater-dresses, over-size twinsets or slim-fitting pants, all in
flat knit.
   Daytime colors were rustic: oatmeal, moss-green and maize. And
there was moderation in the details with a more natural
shoulderline, flat-heeled footwear and skirt-lengths just a
fraction above the knee.
   Biagiotti took Paisley-patterned fringed head scarves in fine
wool and fashioned them into wraparound skirts and did an
attractive series of that fashion indispensable, the ever-popular
little black dress in velvet or silk crepe.
   On a completely different wavelength was the baby doll look of
the collection designed by Muriel Grateau for Complice. Models,
with elfin hairdos, wore short, high-waisted styles with
tight-fitting bodices and jauntily gathered skirts.
   A brand-new girlish look for coats in double wool crepe featured
a shoulder-framing cape collar and a broad martingale belt that
tied tightly in a bow at the waist in back.
   Party dresses came in the same style with waist gathers
transferred to just under the bust while mini-skirts were decorated
with frills and ribbon cockades.
   Almost all the clothes at Complice came in a rich Titian red,
lace-up shoes and stockings included.
   There is a certain style that the Italian designers have always
done beautifully: understated but elegant tailored blazers,
well-cut pants and loose top coats in men's-type smooth woolens.
   It is a look that is timeless and unbeatable, and the women of
Milan love it. Basile did it for them again, tucking pants into the
newly fashionable winter boots and putting velvet on collars for an
even more well-bred air.

   Six men were arrested Wednesday on the New
York State Thruway after a downtown shooting that left one man dead
and two others seriously injured, police said.
   The three men were shot shortly after 8 a.m. in a second-floor
apartment, said police Sgt. Bob Wolfgang. One victim, who was
critically injured, managed to flee the apartment and call police,
Wolfgang said.
   The wounded men, both in their 20s, underwent surgery at Albany
Medical Center Hospital, said hospital spokesman Greg McGarry.
Their identities were not released.
   The man who was in critical condition suffered multiple wounds
to the head and neck, McGarry said.
   Wolfgang would not say if the shootings were drug-related, but
said a drug raid had taken place earlier in the morning at a nearby
residence. Automatic weapons and a shotgun were apparently used in
the shootings, he said.
   About two hours after the shooting, state police stopped a sedan
about 70 miles south of Albany, said State Police Sgt. William
Nolan. The car was carrying six men who were taken into custody,
said Maj. Wayne Bennett. They were taken to the Loudonville state
police barracks and were being questioned, but no names were
immediately released.
   A woman who apparently was at the apartment at the time of the
shooting was also taken to the hospital for observation,
authorities said. She had not been shot.

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British transport plane headed to
the Falkland Islands for military exercises had engine trouble and
made an emergency landing in Uruguay after reportedly being denied
permission to land in Brazil.
   In neighboring Argentina, the government news agency Telam
reported the emergency landing and said the aircraft contained ``a
shipment of bombs and explosives.'' It did not elaborate.
   Both Telam and Radio Montecarlo in Uruguay reported that the
plane landed at Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport on
Tuesday night after Brazil refused to let it land there.
   British officials said only that the aircraft encountered engine
troubles while heading to the islands and requested emergency
authorization to land.
   The Hercules C-130 aircraft, carrying a crew of seven, was en
route to the Falkland Islands for military exercises that have been
denounced by Argentina, which has claimed the islands since 1833.
   Argentina calls the islands the Malvinas and fought a 74-day war
with Britain over them in 1982 before surrendering.
   Telam said without elaboration that Argentine Foreign Minister
Dante Caputo was ``in telephone communications with his Uruguayan
counterpart, Luis Barrios Tassano.''
   The aircraft was in protective custody of Uruguayan soldiers at
Carrasco airport, said an air control tower spokesman who would not
give his name.
   The British exercises, which simulate an Argentine attack on the
islands, are scheduled to last until March 31.

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson was humiliated by a
third-place finish in his Southern backyard, while a strong black
showing boosted Jesse Jackson to victory as many white voters
shunned Virginia's primaries.
   Robertson lagged far behind Super Tuesday's super winner, Vice
President George Bush, who captured the Republican primary with
103,743 votes or 53 percent to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole's 50,191 votes
or 25 percent, with 93 percent of the 1,986 precincts reporting.
   Jackson's easy win in the Democratic primary with 162,355 votes
or 45 percent was based on a large turnout by black voters, who
cast 40 percent of the ballots in the Democratic primary, said
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``Whites virtually boycotted the Democratic primary,'' he said
Wednesday.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore was next with 80,650 votes or 22
percent, followed closely by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
with 78,141 votes or 22 percent. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was
fourth with 16,082 votes or 4 percent.
   Jackson captured 38 delegates, Gore had 22 and Dukakis won 15.
   Sabato said the ``abysmal'' voter turnout _ about 21.5 percent
of the 2.6 million Virginians eligible _ should have helped
Robertson. The former Virginia Beach television evangelist was
believed to have the most committed followers of all the GOP
candidates, but their impact was not felt at the polls.
   ``No one thought Robertson would do so poorly,'' he said. ``This
is a real humiliation for him.''
   Robertson captured only 29,556 votes or 15 percent. New York
Rep. Jack Kemp was next with 8,696 or 4 percent. No delegates were
selected in the non-binding Republican primary.

   Missiles exploded in Baghdad and Tehran
on Wednesday and artillerymen shelled border cities in the 10th day
of random attacks on civilian targets that have killed or maimed
hundreds of people.
   Iran said 35 were killed in Tehran and Iraq reported deaths in
Baghdad, but did not give figures. The missile duel that began Feb.
29 is the latest round in the ``war of the cities,'' which has cost
thousands of lives since the Iran-Iraq conflict began in September
1980.
   A Kremlin official acknowledged Wednesday that the Soviet Union
furnished short-range missiles to Iraq, but said modifying them so
they could reach Tehran was not part of the deal. Iran had accused
the Soviets of providing the weapons, and a mob tried to storm the
Soviet Embassy in Tehran on Sunday.
   In the Persian Gulf, shipping officials confirmed a raid by
Iraqi warplanes Tuesday on the 101,977-ton Felicity, a Cypriot-flag
tanker under charter to Iran. They said the ship sustained minor
damage.
   The raid ended a three-week lull in attacks on commercial
shipping by both sides that have damaged more than 400 vessels.
   American warships escorted the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City down the gulf Wednesday. It was the tanker's first trip
since being hit by a Silkworm missile Iran fired into the Kuwaiti
anchorage in October.
   Iraq said it fired three surface-to-surface missiles into Tehran
on Wednesday. Iran said 35 people were killed and 120 wounded by
those rockets and another that fell on the city the night before.
   It said Iranian gunners fired two missiles at Baghdad.
Dispatches from the official Iraqi News Agency said only one hit
Baghdad but it demolished houses and stores, ``killing or wounding
numbers of civilians.''
   Iran claims to have fired 25 missiles into Baghdad and several
at other Iraqi cities. Iraq has reported 47 missiles launched, all
but five at Tehran.
   Casualties in Tehran totaled 157 dead and more than 420 wounded
through Wednesday, according to official Iranian reports. Iraq has
reported ``many'' civilians killed or wounded, but has not given
figures.
   Reports from Iraq said Iranian artillery pounded the southern
port of Basra during the night, killing ``many civilians,'' and
later poured shells into Qurnah and Zubair, to the north and south
of Basra respectively.
   It said the shells hit densely populated residential areas of
Basra and the dead included four children buried in the rubble of
their home.
   The Iraqis said their warplanes raided military and economic
installations in several towns or cities of western Iran.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
said in Moscow: ``The Soviet Union previously delivered a limited
shipment of short-range missiles'' to Iraq. ``We never gave our
permission to modify those missiles to increase their range, and
modernization was not foreseen by that agreement.''
   Western military analysts had said the missiles were
Soviet-built Scud-B weapons provided by other countries, possibly
North Korea, to which the Iraqis attached boosters enabling them to
reach Tehran.
   Both sides have Scud-Bs, which have a range of 190 miles.
Western experts say Iran's missiles are supplied by its Arab allies
Syria and Libya.
   Baghdad is within easy range 80 miles from the border but Tehran
and the Iranian holy city of Qom, which also has been rocketed, are
nearly 300 miles from the frontier.
   A U.S. Navy official, who could not be identified under Navy
rules, said the 81,283-ton Sea Isle City and 79,999-ton Chesapeake
City were part of the 16th convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers this
year. He said the missile frigate USS Simpson was accompanying them.
   Eleven Kuwaiti tankers have been given U.S. flags and
registration so the Navy can protect them. Convoys began in July.

<HEAD>Army Depot To Resume Chemical Weapons Disposal Year After Gas Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOOELE ARMY DEPOT, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incineration of obsolete chemical
weapons will resume this week at this remote desert installation,
where disposal operations were shut down after a nerve gas leak 13
months ago.
   Work began Tuesday to prepare equipment for renewed destruction
of M-55 nerve gas rockets at the Chemical Agent Munitions Disposal
System, said depot spokesman W. Allen Kenitzer. Disposal operations
were to begin by week's end, he said.
   The Army is using the facility to test equipment and procedures
it eventually will use to destroy the nation's aging chemical agent
stockpile. The size of the chemical arsenal is classified but has
been estimated at 30,000 tons.
   On Jan. 28, 1987, a small quantity of deadly liquid nerve agent
leaked from an incinerator. No injuries were reported, but the Army
closed the plant pending an inspection and review of management
problems that allowed the leak to occur.
   Corrective actions included increased quality control, tougher
requirements on plant filter units and stricter emphasis on
monitoring and maintenance, Kenitzer said.
   The Tooele facility has disposed of 38,000 missiles, shells or
bombs filled with nerve or mustard agent since operations began in
1979.
   The depot is one of nine chemical storage sites officials plan
to use for incineration of old chemical arsenals using the Tooele
model.

<HEAD>Was Super Tuesday A Super Success?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The splintered results of the South's regional
primary gave both its architects and its detractors room to claim
they were right about Super Tuesday.
   ``Super Tuesday succeeded,'' said one who was present at its
creation, former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia. He saw his state go
to Jesse Jackson but his own candidate, Albert Gore, establish his
candidacy in much of the rest of Dixie.
   ``Super Tuesday is not what I hoped it would be,'' said
Florida's state Democratic chairman, Charles Whitehead. His state
and Texas, the two big delegate prizes of the South, went to
Northerner Michael Dukakis.
   The sharp, three-way division of Democratic winners means no one
will likely clinch the nomination before the convention in Atlanta,
former President Jimmy Carter said.
   ``I was surprised at how well Gore did,'' Carter said. ``I
thought (Richard) Gephardt would do better in the South.''
   Twenty states held Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday,
including the 14 Southern and border states and six others,
including Dukakis' own Massachusetts.
   In total popular vote, the result was a near-equal division
among the three winners. Jackson, the black candidate, won the most
votes with 2.54 million, or 27 percent. Dukakis got 2.51 million,
or 26 percent, and Gore got 2.46 million, also 26 percent.
   ``Super Tuesday pretty much guarantees a protracted struggle for
the Democrats,'' said Merle Black, political science professor at
the University of North Carolina. None of the candidates, he said,
displayed the strength needed to defeat the Republicans in November.
   Super Tuesday was largely a Democratic creation, led by Southern
Democratic legislators. But it was the Republicans who got the
decisive winner, George Bush.
   ``The great Republican fear was that Pat Robertson would emerge
as a strong, divisive force,'' Black said. ``That possibility has
pretty well dissipated.''
   Texas state Sen. Chet Edwards, one of the sponsors of the bill
that created Texas' entry into regional primary, declared the day
``a real success story.''
   ``I think the biggest myth that non-Southerners have about Super
Tuesday was that it was set up to assure the nomination of a
conservative Anglo Southerner,'' said Edwards.
   Instead, he argued, Super Tuesday had wide support among
Hispanic and black minorities in Texas. The goal, he said, was not
to nominate a conservative or a Southern candidate but to give the
South a voice early in the nominating process, before the choices
had been too narrowed.
   ``It speaks well for the South and for Michael Dukakis that the
governor of Massachusetts can come to the South and address the
issues and win,'' said Edwards.
   But even some of its boosters acknowledged Super Tuesday may
have been a bit of overkill, with 20 states voting. If the idea
survives, some say there may at least be a reduction in the number
of states holding primaries on the same day.
   The wide battleground, coming just three weeks after New
Hampshire's primary, put a premium on television advertising and
the money it takes to buy it.
   Candidates fell back on the one proven method of moving large
numbers of voters in a short time span: negative advertising.
Dukakis and Gore blistered Richard Gephardt with tough negative ads
that took their toll.
   ``Each of the other three beat expectations,'' said former party
chairman Robert Strauss. ``It came out of Dick Gephardt's hide.''
   And Super Tuesday also said something about the hoopla
surrounding Iowa's caucuses, the first event of the season and the
one that seemed to get the most attention. Its winner was Gephardt,
the big loser of Super Tuesday.

   South Africa may have aided canoe-borne
raiders who staged an abortive coup attempt in the West African
island nation of Sao Tome and Principe, it was reported Wednesday.
   Officials said security forces captured 43 armed men who landed
in fishing canoes before dawn Tuesday on beaches near Sao Tome, the
capital of the Marxist nation 100 miles west of Gabon.
   President Manuel Pinto da Costa said in a national radio
broadcast that soldiers, police and militiamen were searching for
two remaining members of the assault force. He appealed for calm
and vigilance against renewed attacks.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said Celestino da Costa, prime
minister of the two-island nation, identified one of the captured
assailants as Afonso Santos. It said he was leader of an opposition
group that sought asylum two years ago in South African-ruled
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Lusa said 76 Sao Tome exiles arrived by boat in South
Africa-ruled Namibia in May 1986 and sought South African aid to
overthrow the government of Pinto da Costa.
   The agency said a South African Foreign Ministry spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the South African
government had granted asylum to the refugees. But he denied
reports that it trained about 100 refugees from Sao Tome and
Principe to overthrow the government, Lusa said.
   Da Costa, whose Sao Tome and Principe Liberation Movement has
governed since independence from Portugal in 1975, blamed the
opposition National Resistance Front. The front is based in
Libreville, the capital of pro-Western Gabon.
   The Lisbon-based secretary-general of the front, Quintiliano
Amado, denied it was behind the attack. But he said it may have
been carried out by dissidents within his movement.
   Earlier Wednesday, informed sources in Sao Tome and Principe
told The Associated Press that government opponents, possibly based
in Gabon or South Africa, were suspected in the raid, which left
two attackers dead and one assailant and a policeman wounded.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
investigators would seek information about Sao Tome exiles expelled
from Gabon to South Africa two years ago.
   They said the attackers were armed only with light weapons and
that Angolan troops stationed on the islands were not called to
assist in capturing the raiders. They said the army was no longer
securing key facilities and life had returned to normal.
   The two volcanic islands of 110,000 people are known chiefly for
their white sand beaches, coffee and cocoa plantations, and
brightly colored tropical birds.
   But attention was focused on their strategic position in the
Gulf of Guinea in 1978 when rumors of an imminent invasion swept
the country. Cuba, Angola and Guinea-Bissau sent troops to help
defend the islands.
   The invasion never happened, but the country since has
strengthened its ties with Angola, Cuba and the Soviet Union. News
reports in 1984 said about 2,000 Soviet and Cuban troops were
operating two radio stations and a submarine port in the area.
   An estimated 1,000 Angolan troops also are stationed in Sao Tome
and Principe to support the regular army.

   Long-distance telephone service for
more than a quarter-million customers in Santa Barbara and part of
San Luis Obispo counties was cut off Wednesday after a cave-in at
an excavation project damaged a major phone line, officials said.
   GTE California Co. said it has 196,000 residential and 68,000
business customers in the affected area.
   The excavation accident in Los Angeles kinked the only major
long-distance line into the affected region, said American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. spokeswoman Kelly Williams. AT&T owns the
line, but rival long-distance carriers MCI and Sprint lease space
on it, she said.
   Telephone customers in the affected area could not call out to
or receive calls from other areas of California or out of state,
officials said. Calls within the affected area weren't affected.
   Ms. Williams said the line was expected to be repaired by
mid-afternoon. The accident occurred about 9:30 a.m.

<HEAD>Study Sees Short-Term Prosperity for Northeast, Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's industrial heartland will prosper
in the next few years, but lagging population growth threatens the
region's political clout and share of federal programs, a public
policy group said Wednesday.
   The hemorrhage of jobs from the region was another point of
weakness in the 18 northern states stretching from Minnesota to New
England, the Northeast-Midwest Institute said in its study, ``The
State of the Region.''
   ``The short-term economic outlook for the entire region is
positive,'' the report said. The region shared in the national
return to prosperity from 1983 to late 1986, with New England
benefiting the most and the Midwest the least.
   However, the study warned that the region's well-being is
endangered by the failure of its population growth to keep pace
with the rest of the nation's.
   ``The trend is expected to continue through the turn of the
century,'' the study said. ``Government researchers expect
population in the Northeast and Midwest to grow at only 3.8 percent
throughout the 1990s, about half the national average.''
   The Sunbelt states in the South and West will show population
increases of 10 percent in the 1990s, the study said.
   The lagging population gains in the Northeast and Midwest result
both from lower birth rates and migration to southern and western
states, the study said.
   Slower population growth translates into less clout in Congress,
with the region expected to lose 14 House seats after the 1990
census. The region lost 15 seats after the 1980 census, for a total
projected loss in representation of 13 percent in the 1970s and
1980s, the study said.
   ``Political influence, from the selection of the president in
the electoral college to appropriation fights in the House of
Representatives, will shift further to the South and West,'' the
study said. ``Moreover, because billions of dollars are allocated
by formulas based on population, the Northeast-Midwest region can
expect reductions in its share of federal funding.''
   Although unemployment dropped below the national average in
parts of the region, it was unlikely to regain many of the 1.3
million manufacturing jobs lost between 1980 and 1986, the study
said.
   The South and West for the first time topped the Northeast and
Midwest in manufacturing employment in 1986. The Sunbelt had
9,542,500 employees on manufacturing payrolls, compared with
9,394,000 in the Northeast and Midwest.
   Other points made by the study were:
   _Per capita personal income increased faster in the Northeast
and Midwest than in the South and West.
   _The Northeast and Midwest invested more in public school
education than did other regions.
   _The trend toward an older population was more evident in the
Northeast and Midwest than in the rest of the country.
   The study covered these states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.
   The privately funded Northeast-Midwest Institute was formed in
1977 at the request of members of the House and Senate from the
region. The study was also sponsored by two legislative groups: the
Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition and the Northeast-Midwest
Senate Coalition.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. swamped his fellow
Democrats in his home state and on Wednesday predicted that his
victory in five presidential primaries proved his campaign can
survive a national contest.
   ``Two or three days ago, the conventional wisdom ... through the
country was that Super Tuesday was going to see the end of Al
Gore's campaign. The conventional wisdom was wrong,'' Gore said.
``Sooner or later, it's going to stop being a surprise.''
   With all 2,391 precincts reporting, Gore had 414,569 votes or 72
percent; Jesse Jackson received 118,615 votes or 21 percent;
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 19,268 votes or 3 percent
and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 8,657 votes or 2 percent.
   In the Republican race, Vice President George Bush had 151,130
votes or 60 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 54,493 votes or 22
percent; former television evangelist Pat Robertson had 31,402
votes or 12 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 10,871 votes
or 4 percent.
   Based on those results, Gore would take 56 Democratic delegates
and Jackson would get 14. Bush would capture 29 of Tennessee's 45
GOP delegates, Dole 10 and 6 would go to the national convention
uncommitted.
   Gore predicted his Super Tuesday showing would propel him to the
Democratic nomination to face Bush in November and ``bring the
party back to the grass roots and make a fresh start for America.''
   Gore, who will be 40 on March 31, likened himself to the late
John F. Kennedy.
   ``In 1960, we replaced the oldest president then to serve with
the youngest to be elected,'' he said. ``We have a chance to do it
again.''
   About 150 Jackson supporters cheered as they watched election
returns Tuesday night in Nashville.
   ``I think it's a victory,'' said Jackson's Tennessee chairman,
state Rep. Lois DeBerry. Jackson would have carried Tennessee if
Gore hadn't been in the race, she said.

   White voters who joined ranks with Jesse
Jackson in a state once known as a bastion of segregation helped
put him over the top in Alabama's Democratic primary.
   In the Republican contest, Vice President George Bush swept to
victory atop a record turnout on Super Tuesday. Bush picked up an
estimated 35 of the state's 38 GOP delegates, with Kansas Sen.
Robert Dole apparently getting the other three.
   Among Democrats, Jackson gained an estimated 30 delegates, but
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ran stronger than expected in his
neighbor state and appeared to be pulling the remaining 26
delegates.
   For the Jackson forces, the victory was particularly sweet in
the Cradle of the Confederacy, where blacks were routinely denied
the right to vote before the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
   ``Jesse Jackson's message has touched the hearts of many in the
South,'' said his state coordinator, Youlanda Curtis. The victory
``shows that Alabama is progressing. Alabamians should be proud,
both black and white.''
   Al LaPierre, executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party,
estimated that Jackson received as much as 5 percent of the white
vote in addition to overwhelming black support, helping to give the
former minister the margin of victory.
   With 3,788 of 4,304 precincts or 88 percent reporting Wednesday,
Jackson had 165,570 votes or 44 percent to Gore's 139,892 votes or
37 percent. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was next with 28,949
votes or 8 percent and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 27,997 or
7 percent.
   The GOP turnout appeared headed toward 230,000, defeating the
1980 record of 211,000 for a Republican presidential primary in the
state.
   With 3,713 of 4,304 precincts or 86 percent reporting, Bush had
127,937 votes or 64 percent, Dole followed with 32,274 or 16
percent, Pat Robertson was third with 28,174 or 14 percent and New
York Rep. Jack Kemp had 9,739 or 5 percent.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Bob Kerrey burst onto the
political scene in 1982 by winning the governorship in a state
dominated by Republicans, then made the gossip columns with his
romance with actress Debra Winger.
   The free-wheeling style that carried him to the governor's
mansion in his first political campaign won't change much as he
seeks election to the U.S. Senate, Kerry said.
   Unopposed for the Democratic nomination in the May primary,
Kerrey has been campaigning for several months but planned to
formally announce his candidacy Thursday.
   Two Republicans, incumbent Sen. David Karnes and Rep. Hal Daub,
are battling for the GOP nod. Karnes was appointed by Gov. Kay Orr
to fill the seat after the death last year of incumbent Democrat
Edward Zorinsky.
   Despite his frequent assertions when he left the governor's
mansion in 1986 that he didn't know if he would again seek public
office, Kerrey was regarded by political observers as a possible
Senate candidate. When Zorinsky died of a heart attack, Kerrey was
seen as his party's best hope.
   ``I had to decide if I would enjoy this, if I wanted to serve
and whether I wanted a public or private life,'' Kerrey said.
   A war hero who earned the Medal of Honor and lost part of a leg
as a Navy commando in Vietnam, Kerrey became a successful
entrepreneur who owns several restaurants and then a successful
politician.
   He became an intregral part of the Democratic scene when he
worked for Gary Hart in 1984, and was instrumental in Hart's
victory in the Nebraska primary.
   Part of his personal notoriety came from his relationship with
Winger, who married actor Timothy Hutton a few years ago.
   Kerrey, 44, is ready and willing to discuss his campaign, but he
usually deflects questions about Winger.
   ``We are friends,'' he said recently. ``I don't know that there
is anything else to be said.''
   He is divorced and the father of two children. Ben, 13 and
Lindsey, 11, live in Texas with their mother.
   An interview with Kerrey is often peppered with off-the-record
asides, some self-deprecating and some reflecting that he doesn't
appear to take himself too seriously.
   Kerrey chose not to seek a second term as governor, saying it
was time to seek other challenges.
   The former governor admits he doesn't have a list of proposals
and solutions.
   ``I learned as governor you don't solve problems from the top,
down. What you do is engage the citizens in an effort to find out
what we are willing to do about a problem.
   ``My sense is that we are afraid sometimes to try something
different, to get in there and say, `Hey, we're going to try to
make a difference here.'''
   Part of the political process, he says, is to ``select that part
of the status quo we want to hold on to, and that part which we
want to change and that's where the fun of it is.''
   The cost of campaigning keeps many out of the political arena,
according to Kerrey. The Nebraska Senate race could cost each
candidate as much as $6 million, he said.
   ``If you don't conclude after this race that campaign spending
restraints are needed, you've got a pretty warped sense about how
democracy should operate.''
   In Kerrey's first political outing, he defeated incumbent
Republican Gov. Charles Thone.
   During that campaign, he often spoke of the ``hopes and dreams''
of Nebraskans and his vision of the future, and to some, he seemed
a living symbol of determination. Despite the loss of his right leg
below the knee, he runs five miles every day.
   A troubled farm economy led to four years of tight budgets, and
Kerrey's readiness to trim state spending didn't endear him to some
Democrats or to state employees.
   ``No one tells you that everything will go your way just because
you have good plans and good intentions,'' Kerrey said. ``That's
because things don't always go your way. So you do the best you can
by facing the realities of the problems.''

   The European Parliament on Wednesday
rejected a European Economic Community financial aid package for
Israel in a protest of the nation's treatment of Palestinians in
the occupied territories.
   By a 205-143 vote, the Parliament rejected the EEC's agreement
to provide Israel with low-interest development loans of up to
$76.9 million in the next four years.
   In separate votes, the Parliament turned down two minor accords
updating the EEC's treaties on the sale of Israeli farm produce in
Europe.
   This is the first time the Parliament has rejected EEC
agreements since it was given the power last year to ratify foreign
treaties.
   All three documents will have to go back to the 12 Common Market
capitals for renegotiation, which could delay implementation for
several months.
   The vote represents a sharp rebuke to Israel for its policy in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Many deputies also criticized Israel for breaching an unrelated
pledge to allow Palestinians to export their farm produce directly
to Europe. Instead, all Palestinian exports must be channeled
through Israeli authorities.

<HEAD>Gore, Facing Tough Fight for Next Victory, Goes to Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., looking for a new win to
follow up his Super Tuesday successes, faced potential problems
Wednesday in both of the next two states on the Democratic schedule.
   Gore traveled to Chicago with a recognition that Illinois poses
large obstacles to his candidacy, with two favorite sons _ Jesse
Jackson and Paul Simon _ running hard for next Tuesday's primary.
   South Carolina Democrats select delegates in caucuses on
Saturday, and Gore had planned to fly to that state for campaigning
on Wednesday and Thursday. But with Jackson favored to win a lion's
share of delegates in the state he was born in, Gore postponed his
visit until at least Friday, campaign spokesman Paul Risley said.
   Faced with the task of proving he has a truly national campaign,
Gore said he would compete head to head with Simon, Jackson and
Michael Dukakis in Illinois.
   ``It's true that there are two favorite sons in Illinois,'' Gore
said as he flew to Chicago from Nashville, Tenn. ``Both of them
have substantial support. We're going to be competing vigorously
there.''
   Dukakis, also campaigning in Illinois, taunted Gore with his
victories in the big Southern states of Texas and Florida and
questioned whether Gore had in fact vaulted to the top tier of
Democratic contenders.
   ``I'm not so sure he's a major contender,'' Dukakis said. ``A
guy from Massachusetts beat him in Texas, beat him in Florida. He
wasn't willing to go into the early primaries. But I still take
everyone seriously.''
   Gore also sought to parlay his strong showing on Super Tuesday
into fund-raising strength. Gore won six states: North Carolina,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Nevada.
   ``They've got a full press going,'' Risley said of Gore's
campaign finance office, where at least ten fund-raisers were
working the telephones all day Wednesday.
   Gore, too, was making phone calls to potential contributors and
trying to strengthen his Illinois campaign. The campaign expected
to reach 10,000 people by telephone over 48 hours to ask them for
contributions.
   ``In the past five days, we have raised $500,000. This victory
caused tremendous response,'' Gore said.
   The Gore campaign took out a $1 million line of credit to air
more television commercials in the final days of the Southern
campaign. Officials said there was $500,000 and $1 million on hand.
   Gore said the outcome of Super Tuesday, with wins for himself,
Jackson and Dukakis, narrowed the field, and he suggested Richard
Gephardt would be knocked from the race.
   ``It's a three-person race between Gore and Dukakis and
Jackson,'' he said.
   Illinois' primary next Tuesday offered only a week for Gore to
establish his credentials in a Northern state. While he was
campaigning there, his campaign considered how much money to invest
in that state, regarding a large investment there as a high-risk
strategy.
   Beyond Illinois on the Democratic presidential calender are a
series of big, Northern states, including Michigan on March 26.
   ``Two or three days ago, the conventional wisdom ... was that
Super Tuesday was going to spell the end of Al Gore's campaign. The
conventional wisdom was wrong,'' Gore said. ``Sooner or later, it's
going to stop being a surprise.''
   The Gore campaign suggested Dukakis was not an electable
candidate, with Gore depicting both Dukakis and Jackson as
representative of the Democrats' debacles of 1984 and 1972. Gore
contended he was attracting the independent voters that Democrats
will need in November.
   ``They both offer a defense and foreign policy that has been
rejected by the American people many times,'' Gore said. ``I think
the people are asking for more.''

<TEXT>
   Arab tax collectors
resigned this week, giving impetus to a campaign by leaders of the
Palestinian uprising to cripple Israel's occupation government in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli officials have fought to keep the resignations from
taking place, warning those who quit they won't get severence pay
and telling community leaders they may lose basic services.
   The resignations threaten to add to the financial burden of
occupation and deprive Israel of a potent symbol of cooperation and
coexistence.
   ``You can't go against 600,000 people in Gaza,'' said Eid Akram
Sharif, former head of the income tax department who led all 40
employes in a mass resignation.
   Sharif, a plump, well-dressed man who nervously twirled his car
keys as he spoke, drew nods of agreement from a half-dozen other
ex-taxmen.
   They sat on chairs in a semi-circle on a dirt street in the
relatively well-to-do Ramali quarter. Children on the corner
erected a barricade. Graffiti on a wall nearby declared the taxmen
to be ``honorable brothers.''
   ``Before we were collaborators. Now, we are nationalists,'' said
Sharif.
   But the taxmen were less than enthusiastic about their new roles
as heroes of the three-month uprising. They felt trapped between
the threats of Arab militants and the pressure from Israeli
authorities who refused to accept the resignations.
   One of the resigned taxmen said Israeli authorities warned him
not to speak with the press or Palestinian activists, saying they
could get up to six months in jail for inciting violence.
   Hafez Al Borno, a gray-haired man in his mid-40s, later drove a
reporter downtown to point out a wall where graffiti demanded the
tax department's resignation on Palestinian Flag Day.
   ``Arab employes of the income tax and value-added tax department
must resign otherwise we will _'' said the graffiti, which
ominously left unsaid what the punishment would be.
   As part of their three-month strike, Palestinians in Gaza and
the West Bank have refused to pay taxes. Israeli authorities
decline to give figures on the non-payment.
   Israel imposed new rules last month on the occupied territories
as a way to pressure the Palestinians to end the activism. They
require Palestinians to prove they paid their taxes before they can
travel abroad or import or export goods. They must also register
when they bring $1,000 or more into the country. The previous limit
was $5,000.
   ``The striking groups will have no mercy on anyone paying taxes.
This money funds the occupation and is a tool of oppression,'' said
a leaflet circulating in the West Bank last week.
   New graffiti targeted police officers as the next to be called
on to abandon their posts. ``Yes to the resignation of police,''
one said.
   In a chilling warning this week in the West Bank city of
Jericho, an Arab policeman suspected of collaborating was stabbed
to death. His body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and left on
his mother's doorstep.
   In response to the PLO campaign, a group of West Bank police
officers issued a statement stressing they were not involved in
suppressing the riots.
   Lt. Mustafa Adawi, spokesman for the group, was quoted by the
daily Al Quds newspaper as saying before the killing that police
limited their jobs to fighting ordinary crime and directing traffic.
   ``It is not their business to arrest protesters, prevent
demonstration or inform on those who participate,'' he said.
``Policemen are an integral part of the Palestinian people and
share their political aspirations for the future.''
   Palestinians claim that more than 20 of the estimated 300 police
in Gaza already have resigned.
   Shmuel Goren, government coordinator for the occupied
territories, said the civil administration had 18,000 employes,
about 11,000 of them teachers who were exempted from the strike
call.
   ``We are today witnessing brutal PLO threats against public
officials and notables in the territories,'' Goren was quoted a
saying by the daily Al Hamishmar.
   A Goren aide warned that life would only become more difficult
for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip if
Israel had to assume the whole burden of administering the areas.
   ``Public services will be damaged if they are to resign, and the
only ones to suffer from these resignations, if they occur, will be
the Palestinians themselves,'' he said.
   The government provides electricity, water, road maintenance,
garbage collection, health care and education.
   Countering Palestinian claims that Israel profited financially
from the occupation, a former military administrator said $160
million was in taxes was collected from the West Bank last year and
all of it was poured back into services for the 850,000 Arab
residents. Figures for Gaza were not available.
   The ex-official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
another $24 million in income and sales taxes was collected from
the 110,000 Palestinians working in Israel and went to Israel's
treasury.
   Leaflets last week called for collaborators to go to mosques and
declare their repentence and for employees of Israeli-appointed
municipal councils to resign.
   In an apparent effort to win good will, the municipal
authorities in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Al Bireh took out
advertisements in newspapers to announce a 25 percent reduction for
1988-89 in property taxes and Al Bireh said it was eliminating city
fees.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis beat Jesse Jackson by a
nearly 3-1 margin to win on home turf in Massachusetts' Democratic
presidential primary, but fell short of the victory margin
predicted in pre-election polls.
   ``It just goes to show you the only polls that count are the
ones on election day,'' said Steve Akey, a Dukakis spokesman. ``We
are very pleased with the landslide victory here in Massachusetts.''
   With 2,114 of the 2,140 precincts or 99 percent reporting,
Dukakis had 413,806 votes or 59 percent; Jackson had 130,643 votes
or 19 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 72,053 votes or
10 percent, and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 31,575 votes or
4 percent.
   Vice President George Bush had 137,639 votes or 59 percent;
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 61,266 votes or 26 percent; New York Rep.
Jack Kemp had 16,331 votes or 7 percent, and former television
evangeleist Pat Robertson had 10,779 votes or 5 percent.
   Based on those results, Bush would get 30 of Massachusetts' 52
GOP delegates to the national convention; Dole would get 13; Kemp
3; Robertson 2, and 4 would be uncommitted. Dukakis would get 79 of
the state's 98 Democratic delegates, and Jackson would get 19.
   U.S. Rep. Chester Atkins, the state Democratic party chairman,
said he had hoped Dukakis would win at least 60 percent of the
vote, but added, ``59 is close enough.''
   Dukakis may have been hurt by some of the ``tough positions (he
has taken) over the years on things that were important for the
state,'' Atkins said.
   ``I also think that it's really a factor that in Massachusetts,
politics is a favorite contact sport and we're probably tougher on
elected officials in Massachusetts than any other state in the
country,'' he said. ``We are the most critical electorate I think
there is in America, which I think is positive.''

<HEAD>Some Had `Super' Reasons For Not Turning Out on Super Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were a lot of reasons why some voters
didn't bother to make Super Tuesday a Super Turnout day. Some of
the best came from Massachusetts and American Samoa.
   The biggest primary-caucus day in history had been billed as a
battle ``south of the Mason-Dixon line and the drive to Dixie,''
according Rep. Chester Atkins of Massachusetts, the state
Democratic chairman.
   ``People in Massachusetts,'' he observed, ``just don't think of
themselves as part of the drive to Dixie.''
   In American Samoa, where 300 Democrats were eligible to take
part in the caucuses, only 36 bothered to do so. National
committeeman Glenn Jones provided a reason: residents of the U.S.
territory can't vote in presidential elections.
   In many states, officials were jubilant over the numbers who
cast ballots in primary elections, which traditionally get a far
lower voter turnout than do the general elections in November. This
year the turnout was higher because there was spice in the
contested elections of both parties.
   The voting in Florida fell short of the 50 to 55 percent
predictions made last week, but still came to a respectable 42
percent of eligible Democrats and 43 percent eligible Republicans.
   ``I would presume a lot of the (George) Bush supporters felt it
was not necessary to go to the polls because he was leading by such
a majority anyway,'' said Dot Joyce, state supervisor of the
division of elections.
   It was that certainty for the outcome that also held down the
turnout in Massachusetts, said Susan Pye, a spokeswoman for the
secretary of state.
   ``The biggest reason why people don't turn out and vote is
because they feel that their vote doesn't matter,'' she said. Only
about a third of Massachusetts' 2.9 million registered voters cast
ballots, and Ms. Pye said it was confidence among Democrats that
Gov. Michael Dukakis was a shoo-in in his home state. Republicans
assumed Bush would win.
   Taking a nose count in some of the 20 Super Tuesday states:
   Maryland: Higher than predicted, but less than the 48 percent in
the 1976 Jimmy Carter-Jerry Brown contest. Of 1.3 million
Democrats, more than 500,000 or 38 percent cast ballots. Of 520,000
registered Republicans, 195,000 or 37.5 percent voted.
   Hawaii: ``This is the first time we've really had a race; I
don't remember this much excitement,'' said Gov. John Waihee,
delighted that Jesse Jackson put up a strong challenge to Dukakis,
whom Waihee supported. Around 4,000 party members _ double the
usual turnout _ attended Democratic caucuses.
   Texas: ``It's very clear Super Tuesday has been super for
Texas,'' said Secretary of State Jack Rains. ``When I stop and
think about the potential for this fall, I can get very excited.''
The turnout in Texas was 35 percent of the 7.9 million registered
voters _ more than 1 million Republicans and 1.75 million Democrats.
   ``Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could bump our registration
totals up to 8.5 million and get 50 percent of those or better to
the polls, which would mean 4.25 million plus in November,'' Rains
said. ``I believe that's an achievable goal.''
   Arkansas: State Auditor Julia Hughes Jones had predicted a
turnout of 514,000. It was 50,000 higher.
   Georgia: The Jimmy Carter primary in 1976 had set a state
record, but the mark was broken Tuesday when 1 million of the
state's 2.5 million registered voters cast ballots ``I love it when
a plan comes together,'' said Georgia Secretary of State Max
Cleland, one of the architects of Super Tuesday. ``This shows that
a regional primary can focus time, attention, money and
organizational talent on one particular goal.''
   Rhode Island: ``Some people might have thought it was a fait
accompli _ that the vice president was going to win and that
Governor Dukakis was going to win,'' said GOP Chairman J. Michael
Levesque. The turnout was was 12.6 percent, best since the 14
percent in 1976.
   Oklahoma: Lee Slater, secretary of the election board, had said
anything over 500,000 would be a good turnout. By unofficial count,
more than 600,00 voted. ``It's a wonderful turnout, it's a super
turnout,'' Slater says now.

<HEAD>Witness: Fetus' Genes Match Those Of Rape Suspect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An alleged rapist whose genes match
those of a rape victim's fetus may as well have left ``a full set
of fingerprints, Social Security number and a signature'' at the
scene of a crime, a medical expert testified.
   Circuit Judge Marvin Mounts is presiding in a hearing to
determine whether genetic tests should be admitted in the trial of
George Forrest, charged with raping eight women between December
1986 and October 1987.
   Four genetic tests on DNA molecules from Forrest's blood, a rape
victim's blood and tissue from the fetus she aborted indicate that
the fetus shared common genes.
   The tests showed a 99.99 percent probability that Forrest
fathered the child, said Michael Baird, laboratory manager of
Lifecodes Corp., the Elmsford, N.Y., company that performed the
tests.
   Mounts has not ruled if the tests described Tuesday will be used
during Forrest's trial.
   ``That's a narrow possibility, albeit a possibility,'' he said
of the test results.
   Forrest, 34, of Boynton Beach, is being held in the Palm Beach
County Jail. He was arrested as police sought a man they dubbed
``The Congress Avenue Rapist,'' after the area in which the attacks
occurred.
   He was charged with eight counts of sexual battery with a deadly
weapon, six counts of sexual battery with force likely to cause
serious personal injury, 4 counts of kidnapping, two counts of
attempted sexual battery and one count of burglary while committing
assault or battery.
   Dr. Karl Muench, a professor of medicine at the University of
Miami, testified that DNA tests are revolutionizing legal
proceedings across the country. He said the results were as
convincing as ``a full set of fingerprints, Social Security number
and a signature'' left at a crime scene.
   The tests use blood, semen or human tissue and semen in a
200-step process that determines whether the genes of an alleged
father match those of a child.
   DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the protein that carries an
organism's genetic information. Each DNA molecule consists of four
amino acids arranged in a code that is unique to each person.
   Forrest's genetic code was determined through a blood sample and
compared with that of a fetus aborted by a white woman he is
accused of raping.
   The genetic code of the fetal material is so similar to that of
Forrest, who is black, that 533,790 other blacks would have to be
chosen at random before one would be found with almost identical
coding, Baird said.
   Asked by Forrest's attorney, James Cassidy, whether two brothers
could produce the same test results because of similar genetic
blueprints, Baird said the possibility was remote unless they were
identical twins.
   Test results have been used in New York, California and Virginia
courts to link defendants to crimes, and Lifecodes is working with
the FBI to develop DNA testing at its laboratories, Baird said.
   In other cases, when DNA tests have indicated that a defendant
is not linked to a crime, the charges have been dropped, he said.

   Federal tax refunds are averaging 6.2 percent
more than last year, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday.
   Through March 4, said spokesman Wilson Fadely, 12.66 million
refunds had been certified, up slightly from the 12.6 million at
this time a year ago. Refunds averaged $802, up from $755 for the
same period of 1987.
   The IRS has processed 22.1 million of the 36.7 million returns
received so far. The number of returns filed was 2.4 percent below
last year's pace, although the gap was considerably less than four
weeks ago.
   The IRS has processed about 1 percent fewer returns than at this
time last year. The backlog of unprocessed returns totals 14.6
million, down from 15.3 million last year.
   The filing deadline is April 15.

   A man apparently bent on revenge against a
deputy city attorney who had successfully prosecuted him a day
earlier opened fire Wednesday in a courtroom, wounding a bailiff
before he was killed, officials said.
   Jeremy Sigmond, 35, of Woodland Hills was killed in the shootout
at Los Angeles Municipal Court in suburban Van Nuys at 10:15 a.m.,
said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman for the city attorney's office.
   The bailiff, county Deputy Marshal Cliff Wooford, 30, of
Palmdale, was shot in the abdomen and was undergoing surgery at St.
Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, said hospital spokeswoman Linda
Roberts.
   The prosecutor, Jessica Silvers, 48, was ``shaken'' but
unharmed, Goldstein said.
   Sigmond ``came looking for her today,'' Goldstein said.
   ``I heard one shot, and then all the doors flew open and people
started streaming outside,'' said Becker Mubani, who was outside
the courtroom.
   Sigmond was convicted in the same courtroom 24 hours earlier of
four misdemeanor counts stemming from an Oct. 22 chase by
California Highway Patrol officers, Goldstein said. He was
eventually arrested in front of his Woodland Hills home, Goldstein
said.
   Goldstein said he did not know what on charges Sigmond was
convicted or the sentences he received, but he said Ms. Silvers had
not been threatened.
   ``He walked into the courtroom and (later) opened fire,'' said
marshal's Cmdr. Clyde Gatlin.
   Mubani said that after the shooting he saw the bailiff running
from the courtroom, ``his left hand covering the wound.''
   The officer staggered down some steps to the sidewalk as other
officers ran to assist him. Mubani screamed, ``Watch, watch, he's
wounded.''
   ``Then the wounded officer began shouting, `Where is the
ambulance, where is the ambulance?''' Mubani said.

   A 19-year-old soldier practicing a
parachute jump became entangled in the doorway of an airplane and
fell to his death, Fort Bragg officials and a newspaper said
Wednesday.
   The incident happened Tuesday afternoon as the soldier was
taking part in a training exercise over the base, said base
spokeswoman Carol Jones.
   Officials refused to give details of the accident, but the
Fayetteville Observer quoted unidentified sources Wednesday as
saying a strap from the soldier's parachute gear begame entangled
in the doorway as he exited the aircraft, and he fell out without
opening the parachute at the proper time.
   He was pronounced dead where he landed, said Master Sgt. Michael
Hartt. The soldier, a member of an airborne infantry regiment of
the 82nd Airborne Division, was not identified pending notification
of family.
   The death is the second fatal parachute accident in six years at
the military base, Ms. Jones said.

   Pat Robertson finished poorly in Super Tuesday
primaries because George Bush won the votes of the conservative
Christian community considered most likely to support the former
television evangelist, analysts said Wednesday.
   Exit polls said Robertson failed to win majorities or even many
pluralities of the fundamentalist, evangelical or born-again
Christian vote in the Southern states.
   ``That's his group, and he didn't get them,'' said CBS News
pollster Kathleen A. Frankovic. ``The core support that Robertson
expects to get clearly wasn't there.''
   Robertson finished second in Iowa last month by drawing
Christian supporters to the caucuses. They made up 36 percent of
the GOP vote there, and he won half of the caucuses. In New
Hampshire, they made up just 9 percent, but again Robertson won
half.
   It was different in the South. In Mississippi, where 24 percent
of the GOP voters said they were fundamentalist or evangelical
Christians, Bush won with 49 percent of the group, to 31 percent
for Robertson, Frankovic said.
   Bush also won the fundamentalist vote in Alabama; Robertson won
it in Georgia and the two men split it in North Carolina, the
CBS-Times polls said.
   Other network polls used other gauges but found similar results.
ABC News said 34 percent of the GOP voters in the South said they
were born-again Christians and 40 percent of them backed Bush, to
35 percent for Robertson.
   NBC said the born-again Christian vote ranged from 28 percent in
Alabama to 63 percent in Tennessee. Bush won it in Alabama,
Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas and split it with Robertson in
Arkansas, NBC polls said.
   ``It's pretty tough to put together a winning coalition if
that's his secret army. He's not getting more than a third of them
anyplace,'' said Sheldon Gawiser, an NBC poll analyst.
   Frankovic said overwhelming approval in the South for Vice
President Bush and the Reagan administration cut into Robertson's
support, and he may have been damaged by negative publicity.
Robertson last week dropped his libel suit over charges that he
shirked combat duty in Korea, still maintaining that the allegation
was untrue.
   ``There was something pulling people to support Bush and there
wasn't something pulling fundamentalists to support Robertson,''
Frankovic said.
   But Claibourne H. Darden Jr., a pollster in Atlanta, had another
view: He said Robertson never had support from more than a hard
core within the ranks of fundamentalists, who make up a much larger
group in the South than elsewhere.
   ``So many people consider themselves fundamentalists in the
South that it gets out of the core group and becomes the norm,''
Darden said. ``He's got the hard core. He doesn't have any more
than that and he never did.''
   In Iowa, where voter turnout is low, and in New Hampshire,
Darden said, the fundamentalist vote was made up largely of the
small central core of Robertson supporters. ``Anywhere you get a
large turnout'' _ as in the South _ ``that core shrinks in
percentage,'' he said.
   The Robertson campaign took a similar line. ``Part of the
problem has been the perception that this group is a monolithic
group,'' said campaign spokeswoman Teresa George. ``We've been
telling people they aren't.''
   As the race moves north, said George, ``I don't think there's
any doubt that Pat Robertson is going to try to reach those
people,'' even he tries to build new support in other groups.
   The margin of sampling error for the polls was about 5 points.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Responsibility for the car bomb
discovered near the hotel where Secretary of State George P. Shultz
was staying remained a matter of conflict Wednesday within the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Hours after the bomb was found and removed by Israeli police on
March 5, a spokesman in Beirut for Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of
the PLO claimed responsibility for the bombing attempt and said
Shultz was the target.
   The spokesman is well-known to Beirut news organizations and
often is in telephone contact with correspondents. The claim was
widely reported and the various PLO factions did not challenge it
immediately or in subsequent days.
   But when an Associated Press correspondent contacted another PLO
spokesman in Tunis on March 7, he denied the PLO had planted the
bomb. Ahmed Abderrahman, a member of Fatah's central committee,
blamed Mossad, Israel's secret service.
   Abderrahman claimed Israel was trying to harden anti-Palestinian
sentiment in Washington and prevent the possible acceptance of the
PLO in any peace talks.
   The AP then asked Bassam Abu Sharif, a close Arafat aide, and he
also denied Fatah involvement in the bombing attempt.
   ``It is nothing to do with Palestinians whatsoever,'' he said by
telephone from Tunis. ``The car bomb was a clear Israeli trick to
make it look like the Palestinians wanted to blow up Shultz and to
make the Israeli security services look good by discovering this
so-called bomb.''
   It is not unusual to receive several claims by competing
Palestinian groups. And some Palestinian sources say that is done
on purpose to confuse Israeli and Western intelligence services
about which group is behind attacks.
   But on other occasions, PLO and Fatah officials have denied
their fighters were involved when they considered claiming
responsibility would harm their cause.
   On Monday, when an Israeli bus was hijacked by three Palestinian
guerrillas there was agreement that Fatah had carried out the
action that ended with the deaths of the three guerrillas and three
passengers on the bus.
   Again, the Beirut source issued the initial claim that Fatah was
responsible. This time, Abu Sharif confirmed the claim, saying:
``Fatah carried out the attack on the bus.''
   So did Azam al-Ahmad, the PLO representative in Baghdad, where
Arafat has his military headquarters. Al-Ahmad, who also is a
senior Fatah official, said the guerrillas hijacked the bus
carrying workers from Israel's top-secret Dimona nuclear power
plant in the Negev with the aim of holding them hostage.
   On Wednesday, however, Hekmat Zaid, chief of the PLO mission in
Budapest, told reporters: ``The aim of the Palestinian commando
action ... was not to take hostages, the plan of the PLO's armed
men was to enter the strictly guarded complex by overpowering the
bus that carried the workers of the Dimona nuclear center.''

   The president of the National Association
of Evangelicals said Wednesday colleges have undergone such a
radical transformation from their religious beginnings that many
are now systematically undermining Christian values.
   ``Many institutions of higher learning have surrendered the
ethical and moral sanctions upon which they were built,'' Ray H.
Hughes told delegates attending the group's convention here.
   They have been cut off from their ``deep roots in the Christian
faith'' and offer up a wide range of ideologies,
``cafeteria-style,'' he said.
   However, he said, the evangelical schools that were founded as a
defense to materialism and secular teachings are themselves moving
away from their basic religious foundations and are in danger of
becoming ``pale carbon copies'' of those secular colleges.
   Evangelical colleges have to return to the principles of
spiritual commitment, Hughes said, because the nation faces ``a
generation of students for whom much in life has lost its meaning,
for whom morality has lost its moorings.''
   The organization, which represents more than 50,000 churches
from 72 Protestant denominations, is holding a series of workshops
and seminars on the theme ``Go Teach.''
   Among the speakers is the Rev. Jerry Falwell, whose Thursday
speech will address television evangelism and its problems.
   U.S. Education Secretary William J. Bennett told the group
earlier that he was angry about the well-publicized scandals
involving television preachers.
   ``It doesn't help my cause to teach moral values when those who
speak the loudest cannot live up to their own beliefs,'' Bennett
said Tuesday.
   Another speaker, M. Wayne Benson, senior pastor of the First
Assembly of God Church in Grand Rapids, Mich., warned his audience
to be careful during these ``perilous days.''
   ``It's a deception of Satan to think that any ministry is above
human frailty,'' Benson said.
   Benson, Bennett, Hughes and others named no names and avoided
any discussion of the latest scandal in evangelism broadcasting.
Famed TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart stepped down from his pulpit
last month after tearfully telling his congregation he had sinned;
published reports said he paid a prostitute to pose naked for him.
   Falwell, who is not a member of the National Association of
Evangelicals, will speak to the organization for the first time. He
accepted an invitation from the National Religious Broadcasters, a
member group of the NAE which last month adopted a stringent code
of ethics for its 1,350 member organizations.
   Several hundred voting delegates of the NAE approved a number of
resolutions of faith, including one on illegal drugs that supports
efforts of the President and Mrs. Reagan in calling for ``an
all-out war to end this travesty.''

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly has approved
unanimously a new constitution that will do away with the concept
of ``president for life.''
   The new constitution, approved Tuesday night on its first
reading, will take effect after its approval by two-thirds of the
National Assembly. The vote is expected later this year.
   Former President-for-Life Habib Bourguiba, who ruled Tunisia
without interruption for 32 years following the end of French
colonial rule in 1956, was ousted Nov. 7 by his prime minister,
Zine el Abidine Ben Ali.
   Ben Ali justified the bloodless coup on grounds that the
84-year-old Bourguiba had become senile and unable to exercise his
duties and that Tunisia needed to revert to genuine democratic rule.
   Bourguiba, who formerly controlled 100 percent of the National
Assembly, had himself named president-for-life by assembly members
in March 1975.
   The former leader has remained confined in his chateau near
Tunis since the coup. All mention of his name has been banished
from the media in this North African Arab nation.
   But the former leader, whose photograph for years was featured
prominently in every television broadcast and on the front page of
every newspaper, remains an unspoken factor in Tunisian politics.
   Tunisian sources said he has steadfastly resisted pressure from
the government to issue a public endorsement of Ben Ali as
Tunisia's president.
   Yet no voice was raised in tribute to him when the National
Assembly, exclusively composed of members of the ruling
Constitutional Democratic Rally, debated the new constitution.
   The Constitutional Democratic Rally is the new name of
Bourguiba's ruling Destourian Socialist Party. The name change was
approved Feb. 28.
   Under the new constitution, the president will be elected for
five-year terms. The president can be reelected but must face
voters every five years.

   A man authorities said used his own paycheck
stub to write a holdup note at a bank was indicted Wednesday on
federal robbery charges.
   Kevin D. Thompson, 26, was accused in the robbery of $8,000 from
a Bloomfield branch of Midlantic National Bank on June 22. He was
being held in lieu of $75,000 bail at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center.
   According to a criminal complaint, the money was handed over
after a teller received a note saying, ``This is a stickup, keep
clam I have a gun give me some $100, 50, & 20 keep clam and no won
will get harm. Thank you.''
   The note was written on a stub from Systems Maintenance Corp. of
Fairfield, where Thompson had worked and was absent on June 22, the
complaint said. The stub had no names on it, but listed specific
pay figures.
   The government's complaint said an anonymous caller last month
described the getaway car, identified Thompson, gave Thompson's
address and gave other details.
   But the defendant's attorney, Lawrence Lustberg, said his client
was innocent.
   ``He has no idea how his stub came to be used and was ``educated
enough to know to spell not like the note is spelled,'' Lustberg
said.

   A Soviet opera singer who defected to
Sweden was reunited with his wife Wednesday after almost seven
years, auguring improved Swedish-Soviet relations.
   ``During all these years, the hope never left me,'' Vera Morozov
told Swedish Radio after arriving by ship at a Stockholm harbor.
   Alex Morozov, who was living in Leningrad, defected in June 1981
during a concert stop in Goteborg.
   In January, he protested to press for his wife's visa during an
official visit of Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov to Goteborg.
   Soviet approval of her visa resolved the last of 21 human rights
cases raised by Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson on a visit to Moscow
in 1986.
   ``We have ... noted a pronounced thaw in the ice, a change, from
before'' in the Soviet attitude, said a spokeswoman for the Swedish
Foreign Ministry.
   The two countries have resolved three other asylum issues since
Carlsson's 1986 visit. The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman was unsure
if other cases were pending.

   Two cousins who hadn't seen each other in
60 years had an unexpected reunion in a hospital waiting room,
where one had gone to have a shoulder injury examined and the other
was seeking treatment of lung congestion.
   Elmer Gnau, 73, on vacation from La Grange, Ky., wound up
sitting just one seat away from Kenneth Gnau, 63, of Margate, at
HCA University Hospital on Tuesday.
   When the nurse came out and called `Gnau,' both men stood up.
   ``I looked at him and asked him his name,'' said Elmer Gnau, a
retired tool and dye maker. ``I knew if he said Kenneth, he would
be my cousin. Not many people are named Gnau.''
   The chance meeting was emotional for the first cousins, who last
saw each other when they were children in Louisville, Ky.
   ``I never thought I would have recognized him,'' said Kenneth
Gnau. ``But I looked up, and my stomach came right up to my throat.
He has the face of my father. I almost cried.''
   Elmer Gnau was in Florida to visit his son, Jerry Gnau, in North
Lauderdale. Still suffering from congested lungs after a bout with
pneumonia a month ago, he went to the doctor for a prescription to
clear up the infection.
   Kenneth Gnau, who retired to Margate with his wife, was waiting
to have an X-ray taken of a shoulder injury.
   Jerry Gnau's daughter, Teresa, said her family had tried to find
Kenneth Gnau three years ago when they saw a picture of his
motorboat in a newspaper. The boat had exploded in a canal in
Margate, but Kenneth Gnau's phone number wasn't listed.
   The cousins planned to visit each other later this week after
Kenneth Gnau undergoes an operation for his injured shoulder.

   The only effective way to prevent the spread
of AIDS is to halt sex outside marriage and to end intravenous drug
abuse, the Vatican newspaper said Wednesday in a major statement on
the disease.
   ``The prevention of AIDS has moral implications of a reach
greater than what it seemed at first,'' said the unsigned editorial
on the front page of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's daily
newspaper.
   ``The responsibility for the battle against the evil does not
fall only on the shoulders of some doctors and researchers, but, on
the contrary, must be shared by everybody,'' it said.
   The Vatican newspaper said the defeat of AIDS ``requires an
effort extended to modify and to overcome ethically aberrant
behaviors.''
   ``The only really effective measure is prevention ... avoiding
the causes of contagion, which means, in 95 percent of the cases,
abstaining from sexual practice outside marriage and from consuming
drugs,'' the editorial said.
   It said medical and ethical prescriptions have coincided before,
such as the campaign against smoking and calls for moderation in
diet.
   The newspaper said trying to prevent AIDS ``by promoting the use
of condoms ... is not only scarcely trustworthy from the technical
point of view, but also and above all inacceptable from the moral
point of view.''
   In December, a report by the administrative board of the United
States Catholic Conference said instruction about condoms in AIDS
education programs could be permitted in the context of church
teaching advocating ``abstinence outside of marriage and fidelity
within marriage.''
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York called the report a ``very
grave mistake'' and said he will not allow such instruction.

   George Bush paused briefly Wednesday to savor the
fruits of his stunning Super Tuesday success while his aides toted
up the vice president's advantages in next week's Illinois primary.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater cautioned against overconfidence
following Bush's 16-state primary sweep. But the vice president
enters his Illinois campaign with the support of Gov. James
Thompson and most other state party officials, as well as the lead
in public and private polls.
   The vice president's aides also have mapped their largest
single-state television advertising effort of the campaign in the
days before Illinois votes.
   Bush's Super Tuesday showing left him with roughly 700 of the
1,139 delegates needed to win the nomination, and Illinois offers
the possibility of another 92.
   Aides agreed that his close identification with President Reagan
helped Bush on Super Tuesday. But a key strategist said it would be
``clearly an oversimplification'' to credit Bush's lopsided victory
to Reagan's popularity.
   Bush himself rested Wednesday before plunging into his campaign
in Illinois on Thursday. His aides tried to avoid sounding
overconfident the day after his string of victories.
   ``I'd rather be more like Ronald Reagan and be cautiously
optimistic,'' said deputy campaign manager Rich Bond. ``It's a
marathon and we've got to play this thing through until we're
mathematically certain that we're going to win the nomination.''
   Atwater had said late Tuesday, ``The second in this business you
start resting on laurels ... is the second you start getting in
trouble.''
   The vice president's aides said they could not quarrel with exit
polls showing Bush benefited handsomely from his association with
Reagan. But Lanny Griffith, who was Bush's Southern regional
political director, said he thought the coattail effect was
exaggerated.
   
   ``His strength was the work that was done in the 14 months
leading up to Super Tuesday,'' Griffith said in an interview. ``The
real heroes were the people that put this thing together.''
   Griffith said that Bush's ties to Reagan helped, ``but that's
clearly an oversimplification. The vice president has shown that he
is as strong on the issues as any candidate.''
   A CBS-New York Times exit poll said that in some states, as many
as four out of five Republican voters approved of Reagan and that
three out of five of them backed Bush.
   ``He stayed away from political rhetoric as usual. He stayed
away from name-calling,'' Atwater said. And he said Bush's
association with ``a very successful administration'' played a big
role in his victories.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairman of Bush's Illinois
campaign, attributed at least part of Bush's Super Tuesday success
to mistakes by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``I think he's terrific. I think he's funny. I think a lot of
him,'' she said of Dole. ``But Bob Dole did himself in'' by seeming
too ingracious after losing the New Hampshire primary to Bush, she
said.
   In a telehone interview, she said Bush is being perceived as
sending a more positive message.
   ``I don't think it's because George Bush suddenly became so
charismatic that you couldn't take your eyes off him,'' she said.
   Bush carried all but the state of Washington Tuesday, winning
around 600 delegates, the largest one-day collection in the history
of presidential nomination politics.
   By refusing to meet Dole in one-on-one debates in Illinois, and
by hewing closely to a campaign regimen that has Bush mixing
frequently with people and posing for pictures, the vice
president's strategists signaled they plan no change in campaign
style.
   ``The vice president is going to go and do in Illinois what he
did in New Hampshire and in South Carolina, and that is, go through
all corners of the state, campaign directly and forthrightly and
get his message out,'' Atwater said.
   Bush is scheduled to campaign nonstop in Illinois from Thursday
through Monday, including a one-day flying tour of the state.

<HEAD>Bush, Gore Get Help from A President and Governor in Kentucky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of Vice President George Bush
credited his huge Kentucky win to President Reagan's popularity,
while Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. got help in the Democratic
primary from the state's governor.
   Bush's 16-state primary sweep over Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in the
South and elsewhere on Super Tuesday ``will practically cinch the
Bush nomination,'' said U.S. Rep. Harold ``Hal'' Rogers, who led
Bush's state campaign.
   ``George Bush is not just whistling Dixie, he's got the full
orchestra behind him,'' Rogers said Wednesday.
   Gore emerged from Kentucky's primary with less than half the
popular vote, but with the backing of Gov. Wallace Wilkinson he
could control more than two-thirds of the state's 62 delegates.
   With all of the 3,243 Democratic precincts reporting, Gore had
145,201 votes or 46 percent, followed by Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis with 59,424 votes or 19 percent and Jesse Jackson with
49,659 votes or 16 percent.
   Gore won 37 of the 55 pledged delegates, Dukakis had 12 and
Jackson, six. Wilkinson, however, will be able to control at least
four of the party's unpledged official delegates, giving Gore a
solid two-thirds of the total delegation.
   ``Al Gore is right for Kentucky; he's right for America. We're
just now starting the momentum in this campaign,'' Wilkinson said
Tuesday.
   In the Republican race, with 100 percent of the vote counted,
Bush had 71,954 votes or 59 percent, to 27,845 votes or 23 percent
for Dole.
   State Sen. John Rogers, of the Dole campaign in Kentucky, said
there had been hopes of getting up to 40 percent of the vote for
the senator, but ``a security vote'' brought the Republicans out
for Bush.
   ``He was just more closely associated with Reagan and the
majority of people _ Republicans anyway _ liked what Reagan's done
for the last eight years,'' Rogers said.
   Bush won 27 of the state's 38 delegates and Dole captured the
other 11.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Continental jetliner that had two tires
blow out while landing at Newark International Airport was flying
without a special braking device that prevents such incidents,
authorities said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the trouble
with the landing Monday of DC9 Flight 612 from Rochester, N.Y.,
said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
   Legally the airline could fly the jet without the braking device
for three days before fixing it, Ms. Bergen said.
   None of the 29 passengers or crew was hurt when both tires on
the main landing gear under the left wing failed, Ms. Bergen said.
   Passengers were taken to the terminal by bus, said Rick Scott, a
Continental spokesman.
   The device is called an ``anti-skid'' braking system, which is
supposed to prevent pilots from applying the brakes too hard,
officials said. If the brakes are applied too hard they can lock
and cause blowouts, officials said.
   Scott said the inoperable braking device had nothing to do with
the tire blowouts. He said the pilot reported the tires blew
``immediately upon landing'' and before the brakes could be applied.

<HEAD>US Considering Ways To Help Non-US-Flagged Ships In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is considering ways to help
merchant ships which aren't flying the U.S. flag in the war-torn
Persian Gulf, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Wednesday.
   ``We are examining a number of options in this regard, but
serious policy, legal, economic and force level issues remain,''
Carlucci told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Since last July 22, the Navy has been protecting 11
Kuwaiti-owned tankers which were reflagged with the Star and
Stripes. The large-scale convoy operation increased the number of
Navy ships in the area from six to about 30.
   The Kuwaiti ships are being protected against attack by Iran,
which has been at war for seven and one-half year with Iraq, an
ally of Kuwait.
   The Reagan administration has been asked for aid by U.S.
shipowners using so-called flags of convenience, such as Panama and
Liberia. The Navy has consistently refused, citing U.S. policies of
helping only American-flagged ships.
   U.S. shipowners ``continue to ask us to provide protection to
their non-U.S. flag vessels,'' Carlucci said. ``Despite our
humanitarian desire to be helpful, our longstanding requirement for
ships to be flying the U.S. flag remains very persuasive.''
   ``Absent a U.S. flag, we believe a substantial foreign force
operational commitment would be mandatory,'' he noted.
   Carlucci did not explain, nor was he asked, what other measures
are being considered.
   However, some shipowners have pushed to have the U.S. Navy freed
to protect shipping under attack if the Navy warships are in the
vicinity. There have been a number of incidents where Navy warships
were nearby when non-U.S.-flagged vessels were under attack.
   The Navy has actually decreased the number of ships in the gulf
area, Carlucci noted, after the battleship Iowa and helicopter
carrier Okinawa were withdrawn earlier this year.
   The withdrawal ``does not represent any change in our policy or
any weakening of our capability,'' Carlucci noted. ``The numbers
will continue to fluctuate somewhat, but our steadfast commitment
along with our capabilities will remain a constant as long as our
presence is required.''
   American allies in Europe are providing a wide range of help for
the Navy in the Persian Gulf, Carlucci noted.
   Most of that aid comes from allied minesweepers, which were sent
into the region after the first of the reflagged Kuwaiti tankers
hit a mine last July 24 and other mines were found in the following
months.
   Japan is also providing financial help, Carlucci noted, but is
prohibited by its U.S.-written laws from sending ships to the
region.
   Carlucci said the Pentagon is considering the sale of four Aegis
defense systems to Japan for use in the Japanese navy. Each would
cost about $1 billion.
   The Aegis, with its sophisticated electronics, is considered the
world's most advanced air defense system and plays a key role in
Navy plans to defend American ships in wartime.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, noted that the sale could be ``a
serious problem'' if any of Aegis equipment were resold to American
enenies. She noted that a Japanese company, Toshiba, reported
helped sell sophisticated equipment to the Soviet Union which the
Soviets then used to make much quieter submarines.
   ``There has never been a compromise by the Japanese
government,'' said Carlucci, noting that the previous incident
involved a private company.
   But Snowe noted that ``even though the Japanese government was
not involved in the Toshiba case, there have been a series of
problems with other nations.''
   Carlucci said, ``we have no reason to question the sincerity of
the Japanese government.''
   Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
noted calls in Congress for Japan to do more in its own defense.
Selling the Aegi systems to Japan ``would buttress our position in
the northwest Pacific'' and improve the Navy's ability to operate
with the Japanese navy, he noted.

<HEAD>Baker Says Fed Should Be Independent, But Not Sheltered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said
Wednesday that the need for an independent Federal Reserve did not
mean the central bank should be ``totally sheltered from outside
advice or criticism.''
   Baker defended the administration against charges that it had
sought to bring undue political pressure on the central bank to
insure that the economy continues growing without a recession
during this presidential election year.
   Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
Baker was asked specifically about a letter that Assistant Treasury
Secretary Michael Darby sent to the central bank on Jan. 28 in
which Darby warned that slow growth of the money supply was
threatening a recession.
   Darby's letter was sent to every member of the Federal Open
Market Committee two weeks before a crucial meeting in which the
group was to set monetary growth targets for this year. The central
bank seeks to provide enough money to the banking system to promote
healthy economic growth while guarding against supplying so much
money that it threatens higher inflation.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., said that in 30 years in Congress
he had never seen such ``overt, direct interference with the
independent Federal Reserve.'' Proxmire, chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, asked whether Darby faced any disciplinary
action for his letter.
   Baker said the Darby letter had been sent without his knowledge
and when he learned about it, he told Darby not to do it again. But
Baker denied that Darby's letter, which he characterized as raising
academic questions about monetary growth, was an example of
administration pressure.
   On Feb. 24, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan issued a
rare public warning to the administration to stop pressing the Fed
to lower interest rates, contending that further pressure might
force the central bank to demonstrate its independence by doing
exactly the opposite.
   Greenspan specifically cited the Darby letter, saying he had
objected to the letter strongly with an administration official,
later identified as Baker.
   Administration critics charged that the Darby letter was just
one example of administration pressure on the Federal Reserve to
keep the economy expanding as a way of boosting Republican chances
of holding onto the White House.
   Baker denied these accusations and said he had never engaged in
``Fed bashing'' since becoming Treasury secretary in 1985. He said
he had worked closely with both Greenspan and former Fed Chairman
Paul Volcker in an effort to coordinate policies on a whole range
of economic issues including international debt, currency exchange
rates, the government's tax and budget policies and monetary policy.
   ``The Federal Reserve ought to be independent, but that does not
mean that they should be totally sheltered from outside advice or
criticism,'' he said. ``It is my view that the administration has a
right and a responsibility to advise the Federal Reserve on all
elements of economy policy, just as we welcome their advice to us
on all elements of economic policy.''
   Baker added, ``The Federal Reserve is independent and it ought
to remain independent, but it is independent within this government
and it is not independent of this government.''
   On another matter, Baker said he did not view the big rise in
the value of the British pound in recent days as a breach of the
currency stabilization agreement between the United States, Britain
and five other top industrial countries reached last December.
   Baker said British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had not
informed the United States beforehand of her government's decision
not to intervene in currency markets to stop the rise of the pound
against the U.S. dollar and other currencies.
   Baker said he did not see the rise in the pound as jeopardizing
the Dec. 22 accord between the United States and other top
industrialized countries to stabilize the value of the dollar
around current exchange rates.
   ``We don't see this as in any way running counter to that
agreement or being somehow a repudiation of it,'' he said, adding
that the recent increase in the British pound had more to do with
British interest rates and monetary policy decisions in that
country.

<HEAD>Challenge in Texas GOP Senate Runoff; Key Race Begins in
Mississippi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Acknowledging that he won't match his opponent
dollar-for-dollar, U.S. Rep. Beau Boulter on Wednesday challenged
millionaire Wes Gilbreath to a series of joint appearances in the
runoff for the Republican Senate nomination in Texas.
   In Mississippi, Republican Rep. Trent Lott promised an
issue-based campaign against Rep. Wayne Dowdy, who won the
Democratic nomination Tuesday for the seat being vacated by Sen.
John Stennis.
   ``We're not running against anybody,'' Lott said.
   In other Super Tuesday primaries, Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes
won renomination in Maryland and will face political newcomer
Thomas Blair in November. In Louisiana, a Republican led the pack
but still faces a runoff for the 4th District seat in Congress.
   ``It will take a united Democratic Party to beat him (Lott),''
Dowdy said. ``It can be won, and things are ripe for the Democrats
to win in November. Mississippi should have at least one Democrat
in the U.S. Senate.''
   Sen. Thad Cochran, a Republican, holds the state's other seat.
   Dowdy polled 189,203 votes or 54 percent to defeat Secretary of
State Dick Molpus, who had 148,051 or 42 percent. Pipefitter
Gilbert Fountain had 13,244 votes or 4 percent.
   Both parties will have runoffs March 29 to choose nominees to
succeed Dowdy, who won his seat in 1981, and Lott, who was elected
in 1972.
   Boulter, 44, who is giving up the House seat he has held for two
terms to run for Senate, finished second to Gilbreath Tuesday.
   With 89 percent of the vote counted, Gilbreath had 252,213 or 36
percent and Boulter had 202,326 or 29 percent. Former state Rep.
Milton Fox of Austin had 132,787 or 19 percent and businessman Ned
Snead of Georgetown had 103,979 or 15 percent.
   Gilbreath, a millionaire from Houston, spent $500,000 on the
race while Boulter's campaign cost an estimated $130,000.
   ``We want to force Mr. Gilbreath out from behind his own
personal money, and billboards and television,'' Boulter said.
   Gilbreath, the only candidate to use television ads in the
senate primary, acknowledged that he was not well-known when he
entered the race and was delighted to finish first on Tuesday.
   ``I think it's unheard of in Texas politics to accomplish
that,'' said Gilbreath, 59.
   Boulter estimated the campaign for the April 12 runoff would
cost ``a few hundred thousand dollars,'' but added, ``I don't think
we need to compete with him (Gilbreath) dollar-for-dollar.''
   Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen easily won the Democratic
nomination for a fourth term and expressed no interest in who the
Republicans choose to oppose him.
   ``I don't look on anyone as unbeatable. I'm going to work very
hard as I always do,'' said Bentsen, 66.
   Thomas Blair, a millionaire businessman who captured 46 percent
of the vote in a nine-man Republican Senate primary in Maryland,
celebrated his victory by accusing Sarbanes of being an absentee
senator.
   ``I predict this summer Mr. Sarbanes, who we have not seen for
years, will come out,'' Blair said, comparing the senator to a
cicada, the insect which turns up every 17 years.
   Picking up an issue from the Republican primary, Sarbanes said:
``The Republican nominee hasn't even bothered to vote over the last
six years, and was taken off the election rolls, which I think
tells you something about his commitment to the political process.''
   In Louisiana, Republican Jim McCrery finished ahead of nine
Democrats in a non-partisan election for the the 4th District House
seat, which will be vacated Monday by McCrery's old boss,
Democratic governor-elect Buddy Roemer.
   McCrery will meet state Sen. Foster Campbell in a runoff on
April 16.
   Rep. Bill Alexander of Arkansas won re-election to an 11th term
on Tuesday by defeating political consultant Darrell Glascock by
2-1 in the Democratic primary. Alexander is unopposed in the
general election.

   Tennesseee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s
victory in Nevada's Democratic caucuses was important because it
showed he could win outside the South, according to Sen. Harry
Reid. But most of the state's top Democrats said they were
impressed with Jesse Jackson's third-place finish.
   ``The good news is how well we've (Gore's campaign) done all
over the country,'' Reid said.
   With all but a handful of precincts uncounted Wednesday, state
party leaders said Gore won with 33 percent or 693 of the 2,101
delegates, followed by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with 548
or 26 percent, and Jackson with 460 or 22 percent.
   Fifteen percent or 329 of the delegates were uncommitted, 2
percent or 39 were for Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, and 2
percent was divided between Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and former
Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado.
   That left Gore leading for 7 delegates, Dukakis for 5 and
Jackson for 3 with 1 uncommitted.
   Bill Wasserman, Dukakis' state coordinator, said he was pleased
with the results but called support for Jackson was ``stunning. It
has got to be a phenomenon that makes any Democratic candidate
think seriously about his campaign effort.''
   Jackson spokesman Joe Neal, a state senator, said the turnout of
Jackson supporters at the caucuses exceeded expectations. ``The
people we contacted went to the caucuses.''
   State Democratic Chairman Beecher Avants agreed that Jackson's
showing was a surprise, adding that he didn't think Jackson had
been doing the pre-caucus mailing and telephone work that
supporters of Gore and Dukakis had.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa criticized
police on Wednesday for using force to break up student
demonstrations in Warsaw and Krakow.
   Walesa made his remarks one day after club-wielding riot police
clashed with youths demonstrating for more academic freedom on the
20th anniversary of student protests against censorship and
political repression.
   On Tuesday, police charged into hundreds of demonstrators in
Warsaw and Krakow and made scores of arrests.
   The leader of the outlawed labor federation said he expected
authorities eventually to admit error in using force against
students this year.
   ``I don't have a detailed account of what happened, but I think
that in a few years' time there shall be great efforts to disavow
all that took place,'' Walesa said before meeting with Austrian
Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Warsaw.
   The authorities use ``such a method of disavowing things that
should not have taken place at all,'' he said.
   A commentary by the official Polish news agency PAP said that in
Warsaw and Krakow ``attempts were made to take advantage'' of
anniversary observances to hold illegal demonstrations.
   ``The attempts were abortive owing to the lack of wider support
and thanks to the determined attitude of the forces of law and
order,'' PAP said.
   The students were calling for restoration of academic freedoms
won during the 1980-81 Solidarity labor upheaval and for
legalization of the Independent Students Union, which was outlawed
under martial law was imposed in 1982.
   Zygmunt Lenyk, a Krakow opposition spokesman, said at least 64
people were detained in the southern Polish city, but everyone was
released later Tuesday. An aide to government spokesman Jerzy Urban
said a total of 83 people were detained in Tuesday's demonstrations
but less than 15 people remained in custody, awaiting appearances
in misdemeanor courts.
   The student protests of 20 years ago were violently broken up by
police and worker activists. But the communist Polish United
Workers Party recently disavowed repressive measures used against
reform-oriented intellectuals 20 years ago.

   President Reagan renewed his vow of neutrality
in the Republican presidential race Wednesday, while White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker said ``it would take a major event'' to
deny George Bush the nomination.
   ``I will remain neutral,'' Reagan told inquiring reporters as he
returned to the White House from a trip to Notre Dame University in
South Bend, Ind. He seemed bouyant, dribbling a basketball he got
at Notre Dame and passing it back and forth with a woman
well-wisher.
   Baker, talking with reporters earlier, said, ``The president is
still neutral and I expect will continue that way for the
foreseeable future.''
   Vice President Bush scored a sweep of the Super Tuesday
primaries, moving within reach of the GOP presidential nomination.
   ``He was the front-runner before and clearly is the front-runner
now,'' said Baker. ``I think it would take a major event to deny
him the nomination. He's certainly got the momentum.''
   Baker, who dropped out of the presidential race a year ago to
lead Reagan's staff, said the last word he had from Reagan was that
as the titular head of the Republican Party, he intended to remain
neutral.
   ``And whether he would re-address that in light of other
circumstances, we'll have to wait and see but I have no indication
of it,'' the former senator said.
   Baker said Reagan was ``awful pleased with the exit polls,''
which showed an 84 percent approval rating for the president among
Republican voters in the South.
   ``I told him this morning ... he was really the one who swept
the South,'' Baker said. ``I think that was a matter of pride for
the president.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with Reagan
aboard Air Force One to South Bend, Ind., also described the
president as ``very impressed with the Republican turnout.''
   ``We have a strong movement toward the Republican Party in the
South,'' Fitzwater said. He called it a ``strong indication of the
realignment that's taken place'' in the region.
   Citing Texas as an example, Fitzwater said that 500,000 persons
voted on the GOP side during the primary season in 1980 and 900,000
voted in the GOP ranks in 1988.
   Baker said the overall Republican voter turnout was about 44
percent of the total vote cast Tuesday.
   ``So that's a far cry from the old Democratic solid South and
that may be the most significant single aspect of Super Tuesday,''
Baker said.
   He said the GOP turnout ``indicates that the Reagan revolution
and the Republican growth in the South is not a transient
phenomenon but is a permanent fixture in the American political
system.
   Commenting on the outcome on the Democratic side, Baker singled
out the success of fellow Tennessean Albert Gore Jr., who won his
own state and four other Souther primaries.
   ``Al Gore may have demolished the theory that you've got to run
in Iowa and New Hampshire. He is a very credible candidate and he
did not make a major effort in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Declassified Documents Indicate CIA, FBI Infilrated LaRouche

<TEXT>
   FBI files declassified Wednesday quoted three
intelligence operatives as saying they had been directed by
high-level FBI and CIA officials to infiltrate the political
organizations of Lyndon LaRouche.
   Excerpts from the files, surrendered to defense lawyers in the
fraud and conspiracy trial of LaRouche, six aides and five of his
political groups, showed that one of the three refused to discuss
his LaRouche-related dealings with low-level FBI officials, saying
he had been instructed by ranking officials at the agencies not to
do so.
   That man, retired Army Sgt. Maj. Fred Lewis, also was referred
to in a memo from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North in which Secord indicated Lewis had
collected evidence against LaRouche.
   Both the declassified FBI material and the Secord memo were
dated in May 1986 and refer to giving Lewis a polygraph to
determine if his information was valid.
   Lawyers for LaRouche, a political extremist who has accused such
international figures as Queen Elizabeth II of drug trafficking,
have obtained growing evidence in recent weeks of infiltration of
LaRouche groups by the FBI and CIA. They contend the effort was
directed by North, the former National Security Council aide fired
for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. Secord worked with North
to set up a private network to aid the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The defense lawyers, who have requested thousands of other
documents from the FBI, CIA and NSC, contend the records will prove
their claim that charges of credit card fraud and conspiracy
against LaRouche and his followers were concocted as part of a
government plot to ruin LaRouche because he refused to support aid
to the Contras.
   ``This was an activity that was headed up by Oliver North and
Mr. Secord in a political attempt to stop the LaRouche people,''
defense attorney Michael Reilly said Wednesday.
   The defense lawyers also have said they believe they have
grounds for dismissal of the case because of prosecutorial
misconduct, contending the government has deliberately withheld
evidence of FBI and CIA penetration of LaRouche groups.
   The three men referred to in the declassified FBI material are
Lewis, Gary S. Howard and Ron Tucker.
   ``Lewis, Tucker and Howard indicated they have a very high level
source in the federal government who advises them regularly
concerning cooperation or lack thereof between Lewis and his
associates and the federal government,'' the document said.
   ``When asked about their possible ties to LaRouche, they claimed
to have been previously been requested by the FBI and CIA to
penetrate the LaRouche organization,'' said the document, which was
excerpted from an unidentified FBI file.
   According to the material, Lewis said he had been instructed by
contacts in CIA and FBI headquarters not to discuss his LaRouche
ties without authorization from top officials at the agencies.
   Defense attorney Daniel Alchorn, who represents LaRouche aide
Paul Goldstein, said during Wednesday's hearing that Lewis was a
principal in a Dallas-based group known as Peregrine International,
which he said was tied to Secord and helped carry out covert
activities for the U.S. government.
   In the North-Secord memo, there is a reference by Secord to
``our man.'' The defense lawyers said they have been informed by
the government that the reference is to Oliver Revell, an FBI
assistant director invovled in counterintelligence.
   Tucker, a former Texas Department of Public Safety Narcotics
Agent, and Howard, a former border patrol agent, claim in a suit
against the Customs Service that they have been government
informants since 1979.
   In the suit, filed in Washington in August, Tucker and Howard
say the government owes them $1.4 million for their expenses in a
sting operation that led to the arrest of a man allegedly buying
arms for Iran. They claim the government lost interest in
prosecuting the case because it would have revealed the Reagan
administration's arms shipments to Iran and the diversion of
profits from the sales to the Contras.
   The FBI document also said that during interviews with FBI
agents in Texas, Tucker and Howard said they had approached family
and friends of Soviet dissidents Andrei Sakharov and his wife,
Yelena Bonner, claiming they could free the couple from the Soviet
Union for $2 million. ``No further information was available
concerning this matter,'' the document said.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. narrowly
defeated Jesse Jackson in a North Carolina presidential primary
that observers said showed the changing face of Southern Democratic
politics.
   ``It shows there are many Souths _ no solid South,'' said Merle
Black, political science professor at the University of North
Carolina. ``It's too diverse.''
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush's lopsided victory in the
Republican primary showed his links with President Reagan were
stronger than Kansas Sen. Bob Dole's ties to North Carolina. Dole's
wife, Elizabeth, is a native of Salisbury, N.C.
   ``What George Bush has shown is that he is strong in the
South,'' said Jack Hawke, state GOP chairman. ``People are
associating him with the president.''
   Bush held off a late surge by Dole, who targeted North Carolina
in his effort to avoid a Southern shutout. Bush had said he was
worried because polls had indicated the contest was neck-and-neck.
   With all 2,387 precincts reporting, Gore had 235,345 votes or 35
percent; Jackson had 223,207 votes or 33 percent; Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had 137,755 votes or 20 percent, and Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt had 37,483 votes or 6 percent.
   In the Republican race, Bush had 124,028 votes or 45 percent;
Dole had 109,999 votes or 40 percent; former television evangelist
Pat Robertson had 26,747 votes or 10 percent, and New York Rep.
Jack Kemp had 11,364 votes or 4 percent.
   Based on those results, Bush was expected to win 29 GOP
delegates and Dole 25. Gore would capture 34 Democratic delegates,
Jackson 31 and Dukakis 17.
   Gore carried North Carolina becuse he ``has a lot of appeal to
middle-of-the road, common sense Democrats,'' said former Gov. Jim
Hunt, who with Sen. Terry Sanford endorsed Gore in January.
   Black, however, said the closeness of the race indicated many
conservative Democrats had not voted.
   ``I don't think Gore would have made any showing if Jim Hunt and
Terry Sanford had not gotten active in his campaign like they
did,'' said Dan Blue, a black state representative who was state
chairman for Jackson.

   Republican Pat Robertson said Wednesday that
Super Tuesday showed the ``mantle of Ronald Reagan has passed to
George Bush'' but he refused to write off his own presidential try,
saying his political agenda now extended beyond 1988.
   ``In the South, where I thought I would be strong, Ronald Reagan
and his mantle was a lot stronger, but there are other parts of the
country that maybe don't feel this way,'' said Robertson, who took
a drubbing at the hands of George Bush.
   Most of Tuesday's contests were in the South, where Robertson
had expected to do well. But he won only nine of the 712 delegates
at stake, losing all 16 primaries and winning only the caucuses in
the state of Washington. Bush won all the primaries.
   ``None of us could have dreamed that (Bush) could be so
strong,'' Robertson said. ``The mantle of Ronald Reagan has passed
to George Bush.''
   Exit polls showed Bush picked up more votes from conservative
Christians than the former television evangelist, and Robertson
blamed himself.
   ``I talked too much up in South Carolina,'' he said, referring
to statements there which seemed to suggest Bush's campaign was
responsible for revelations about questionable sexual practices by
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   ``Some of the things I said, unfortunately, were misinterpreted
by the press, at least spun in a different way than what I
intended,'' he said.
   Robertson also stood by a controversial statement he made during
the New Hampshire campaign. ``I still think there are (nuclear)
missiles in Cuba,'' he said, restating a claim denied by the Reagan
administration.
   Robertson, who also finished behind Bob Dole, said he would
continue the race until the New Orleans nominating convention as
``a rallying point for conservatives.''
   ``I will probably go into the convention with a number of
delegates that are at least mine in heart,'' Robertson said at a
morning news conference in Atlanta, where he watched election
returns Tuesday night.
   He said he would take a day off before continuing to Illinois to
campaign for next week's primary there.
   ``It isn't over yet. There're still half of the delegates left
to be selected,'' he said. ``My goal this year is to win the
presidency. I haven't given that goal up. I am in for principle.''
   Robertson said his candidacy has helped expand the Republican
Party and that will leave him with a reservoir of support he could
tap later, perhaps in 1992.
   ``I will have people favorable to me in key party positions ...
in a lot of (state parties),'' he said, estimating as much as 40
percent of the GOP structure in some states is loyal to him.
   ``That would be a significant base for something in the
future,'' he said.
   If he doesn't win this year, Robertson said, ``my role (in 1990)
will be what George Bush's role was in '86. He went to many, many
congressional districts, helped raise ... about $17 million for
party candidates during that cycle.
   ``I could help a number of good men and women be elected,'' he
said. ``I want to build the Republican Party and make it the
majority party.''

   The Children's Defense Fund urged its
supporters on Wednesday to press the presidental candidates to
increase funding for children's welfare and education programs.
   ``It is now time to reverse course and invest in the future, to
invest in our children, if we as a nation are going to save
ourselves,'' the fund's President Marian Wright Edelman said at a
news conference at the organization's annual meeting.
   Edelman called on supporters to ``urge those seeking and holding
public office this year to commit themselves to making preventive
investment in our children and families the cornerstone of national
domestic policy in the coming political era.''
   The fund will press for immediate enactment of legislation
providing safe daycare and establishing minimum health care
coverage for poverty-level mothers and children, she said. The
group's long-term priorities include five-year incremental
increases in the minimum wage and in funding for educational
programs for poor and handicapped chldren.
   The fund, a non-profit lobbying group for children's issues, has
produced briefing books and a list of questions for its members to
quiz the candidates and eventually elicit support for its
legislative agenda.
   Edelman said she was optimistic about the success of the agenda
because of the ``new and powerful allies'' it has found in
corporate leaders, who want to ensure an educated work force.
   ``What we see now is a new coalition of those who worry about
the health and social welfare of children and those in the business
community who recognize the economic connection in investing in
children who are at risk in this society,'' said Donna Shelala, the
fund's board chairman.
   She referred to the Committee for Economic Development's Report
for 1987 in which the business community spoke ``in terms of
investing in children early on, in prenatal care, in early
childhood programs, and Head Start programs, as ways of ensuring
the economic future of the country.''
   This is the eighth year the fund has produced a children's
budget and provided analysis of the administration's fiscal
proposal. As in the past, the organization criticized the Reagan
administration's emphasis on defense spending over funding for
social programs.

   A mountain lion was shot dead
Wednesday after he was spotted stalking a residential area where
children were waiting for school buses and adults were leaving
their homes for work, officials said.
   The 120-pound male mountain lion was spotted in this northwest
Orange County community below the Chino Hills, said Patrick Moore,
spokesman for the state Fish and Game Department in Long Beach.
   Police cornered the lion outside a house, and a fish and game
warden shot it, Moore said.
   ``These animals are extremely shy and normally don't come in
residential areas,'' Moore said. ``We like to remove the animal
permanently from those situations.''
   Moore said the animal was killed rather than tranquilized
because the drug takes 10 to 20 minutes to take affect and animals
sometimes have a violent reaction to it.
   ``There was fear that he would run amok in the area and threaten
children,'' he said.
   The cat's body was taken to the fish and game laboratory in
Victorville for a necropsy.
   Mountain lions are common to the hillside areas of Southern
California but rarely attack humans.

<HEAD>US To Liberalize High-Tech Sales; China Positive On Accepting
Peace Corps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relations between the United States and China
brightened Wednesday with a U.S. decision to liberalize the sale of
high technology to the Chinese and Beijing's agreement in principle
to accept Peace Corps volunteers.
   The Reagan administration announced that it lifted a five-month
suspension on the transfer of new technologies after receiving
assurances from Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian that his
country was not sending Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran.
   This removed a major irritant in the relationship.
   Then, during a question-answer session at the National Press
Club after three days of talks with U.S. officials, Wu said of the
Peace Corps that ``China has adopted a positive attitude on this
matter,'' though many details still need to be resolved.
   The agency, established in 1961 by President Kennedy to put a
grassroots and people-to-people stamp on U.S. overseas aid,
currently has programs in 64 countries.
   Alexander Sinclair, a Peace Corps spokesman, said
representatives from the two countries will discuss China's
development needs and how the agency can help.
   As for how large the program will be, when it will start and how
many volunteers will go to China, ``It's too early to tell,''
Sinclair said.
   ``We welcome the opportunity to enter in discussions with the
People's Republic of China about a future Peace Corps program
there,'' Sinclair said. ``We expect to have more information about
such a program in the weeks ahead.''
   The presence of Peace Corps volunteers in a country has for many
years been a significant measure of the warmth of its ties to the
United States. The most populated country that has ever accepted
the Peace Corps was India, which invited volunteers from 1962 until
1976, when it shut down the program.
   After more than two decades of years of emnity, including
several years of war in Korea, the United States and China
normalized relations in the late 1970s and have steadily increased
trade and defense ties.
   There have been some rough spots in the relationship recently,
however, and one of the major ones appears to have been smoothed
during Wu's three days of talks with U.S. officials, including a
40-minute session with President Reagan on Tuesday.
   Last autumn, to protest what it said was continuing Chinese sale
of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran, the administration froze a
decade-old process of liberalizing the list of high technology
items China is permitted by buy from U.S. companies.
   China denounced the decision and in his press club remarks, Wu
reiterated Chinese denials of ``direct'' arms sales to Iran. He
also said that since July, Beijing has made efforts to stop the
flow of Chinese weapons sent through other countries.
   He said that in his talks with Secretary of Stte George P.
Shultz and other administration figures, complaints about Chinese
arms sales to Iran were voiced ``20 times.''
   Without commenting on the truth of Wu's denials about arms
sales, administration officials said after meeting the foreign
minister they had no reason to believe Chinese arms are now flowing
from China to Iran.
   ``We are encouraged by Chinese statements and actions regarding
Iran's acquisition of Chinese anti-ship missiles, Silkworms,''
State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   ``We have therefore decided to resume the export control
liberalization process for China,'' he said.
   The administration also announced during Wu's visit that he
assured Reagan his country would not stand in the way of a United
Nations resolution calling for an arms embargo against Iran.
   The United States has been trying for months to line up support
on the U.N. Security Council for an arms embargo against Iran
designed to stop the 7-year-old Iran-Iraq War. The ban on weapons
sales would be the second installment of a U.N. resolution last
July calling for a truce in the war.

<HEAD>Labor Department Says No To Waiver Revocation Stay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Labor Department has rejected
arguments from South Carolina and North Carolina officials who are
trying to keep 17-year-old school bus drivers on the road through
the end of the school year.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell on Wednesday repeated his
state's plea to allow the drivers to remain behind the wheel.
   Representatives of each state argued unsuccessfully for a stay
of the department's revocation of waivers, effective April 1, that
had allowed the use of the young drivers if they had clean driving
records, Labor Department spokeswoman Linda Tavlin said Tuesday.
   The two states won waivers last year of a federal law
prohibiting school bus drivers under 18, but the department revoked
the waivers in late February. In an investigation following the
death of a West Columbia child hit by a 17-year-old driver with a
bad driving record, the department said it found many of the
17-year-olds had bad records.
   Campbell, in a letter to Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, said he
understands the department's decision and does not intend to seek a
waiver for next year. But he said firing drivers before the end of
the school year would not serve the department's purpose.
   ``The State Superintendent of Education assures me that he has
on file a letter from each of the 91 district superintendents
certifying that all 17-year-olds currently driving school buses
meet all ... conditions outlined in the letters of exemption,'' the
governor wrote.
   ``Replacing these drivers with slighly older, inexperienced
drivers for two months could potentially lead to a less safe
transportation system,'' he wrote.
   A spokesman for Campbell said Wednesday the governor's office
will continue working with South Carolina's senators, Ernest
Hollings and Strom Thurmond, to get legislative relief from the
Labor Department's action.
   The U.S. House already has approved a bill that would allow both
states to use the drivers through the school year, and the Senate
is expected to take up the measure next week.
   Carl Garris, deputy state superintendent of schools, said the
state has about 950 17-year-old drivers now, down from 2,250 at the
beginning of the school year.

<HEAD>Nearly Blind Woman Arrested For Using Marijuana To Ease Glaucoma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nearly blind glaucoma victim whose
doctors vainly sought legal permission for her to use marijuana to
help her see now faces up to a year in prison for allegedly growing
her own.
   Elvy Musikka, 43, was arrested Friday and charged with felony
possession of almost a pound of marijuana. She was freed on $1,000
bail.
   Ms. Musikka is sightless in her right eye and retains little
vision in the other.
   ``I don't think I'm above the law,'' she said Tuesday. ``I've
always resented being a criminal to protect my sight. It's a scary
situation.''
   Born with cataracts, she was diagnosed as suffering from
glaucoma in 1976. By 1980 she had to retire from her job as a bank
switchboard operator because of poor vision.
   Glaucoma is characterized by increased pressure inside and
hardening of the eyeball. It can gradually lead to blindness.
   Dr. Paul Palmberg of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the
University of Miami Medical School said 80 percent of glaucoma
patients responded to legal drugs.
   Ms. Musikka, however, did not, and Pamberg said he neither
recommended nor discouraged her use of marijuana to help her see.
   In Ms. Musikka's case, marijuana lowered the pressure of fluid
in her eye while not lowering her blood pressure, allowing the
optic nerve to be nourished with blood, Palmberg said.
   Dr. Richard Parrish, also of the eye institute, said he did not
recommend marijuana, either, but had tried to obtain it legally for
her when he realized it was helping.
   Norman Kent, counsel to the Florida chapter of the National
Organization for the Reformation of Marijuana Laws, said it was
extremely difficult to legally obtain marijuana for medical reasons.
   ``To secure that right, you need a scientist, engineer,
physician, lawyer and magician on your side,'' he said.
   Police spokesman Jim Rabbitt said officers did ``what they had
to do.''
   ``We had a violation,'' he said. ``She's going to have her day
in court.''
   A man who rented a room at her home turned her in for growing
four marijuana plants after the two argued, police reports said.

<HEAD>Missouri Hands Narrow Loss to Dole, Only Win to Gephardt</HEAD>

   Missouri voters dealt Bob Dole a narrow
but embarrassing loss blamed on a tidal wave of Southern support
for George Bush, while Rep. Richard Gephardt tolled his only Super
Tuesday win in his home state.
   Supporters of Dole, a senator from neighboring Kansas, said
polls that showed the vice president with commanding leads in the
Southern states prior to Tuesday prompted Missouri's uncommitted
voters to side with the vice president.
   ``Everything in the past two weeks has been Bush is sweeping the
South, Bush is going to win the nomination, Bush is the next
president,'' Roberta Capps, Dole's Missouri campaign chairman, said
Wednesday.
   With all precincts reporting, the vice president had 168,823
votes or 42 percent and Dole had 164,452 votes or 41 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Gephardt garnered 305,159 votes or 58
percent. Jesse Jackson trailed with 106,287 votes or 20 percent.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 61,557 votes or 12 percent.
   Results showed Gephardt with 68 delegates, Jackson with 14 and
Dukakis with one.
   ``I don't think we have done as well as we'd hoped.'' Gephardt
said in St. Louis after finishing poorly in the 19 other Super
Tuesday states.
   Bill Macon of the Missouri Bush campaign said the victory, along
with the vice president's triumph in Oklahoma, was especially
gratifying because it showed Dole could be beaten in states
neighboring his own.
   ``I'm certainly not trying to humiliate any good Republican but
I think this shows he ought to go back to being the Senate minority
leader and quit cluttering up the race,'' Macon said.
   Bush was expected to capture 22 delegates and Dole 18. Pat
Robertson and New York Rep. Jack Kemp failed to attract enough
Missouri Republican votes to receive any delegates.

<HEAD>Bomber Strengthened Against Damage By Birds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first B-1B bomber to be strengthened
against damage by birds was cleared for flight training Wednesday,
allowing the Air Force to fly a low-altitude training mission with
the plane for the first time in more than five months.
   Lt. Col. Fred Harrop, a spokesman for the Strategic Air Command,
said a B-1B based at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, had flown
low-level bombing runs on a practice range after the Rockwell
International Corp. completed a series of modifications to reduce
vulnerability to birdstrikes.
   ``We're back in business,'' Harrop said.
   The modifications were ordered for all of the Air Force's B-1Bs
after one of the bombers crashed last Sept. 28 in Colorado during a
low-level training flight, killing three of the six crewmen aboard.
An Air Force inquiry determined the plane went down after slamming
into a large pelican, whose body ripped through the underside of a
wing and severed key hydraulic systems.
   The modifications involve strengthening an area between the
wings and engines, which are attached to the underside of the
wings; another area around the so-called pivot pin on which the
wings swing back and forth, and an area around the base of the tail
fin.
   In each case, the service is toughening or shielding the
internal electrical and hydraulic lines that run through those
sections of the plane. The modifications are not visible from the
outside.
   Harrop said the Air Force hoped to have all of the B-1B modified
by late fall.
   Before the crash, the Air Force was allowing B-1B crews to
practice low-level attack runs at an altitude of 500 feet.
Ultimately, the service intends to allow training down to 200 feet.
   Harrop said Wednesday the B-1B with the completed modifications
had flown its training mission at 500 feet.
   The B-1B, the nation's first new heavy strategic bomber in 25
years, is designed to fly just below the speed of sound at
altitudes as low as 200 feet to evade detection. The Air Force has
purchased 100 of the bombers, but will be left with 99 because of
the Sept. 28 crash.

<HEAD>Nuns Resign As Hospital Managers After Town Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Catholic nuns resigned as
managers of the hospital in this small Minnesota town after nearly
1,500 people gathered to protest suspension of the hospital's
obstetrics services and the resignation of a respected doctor.
   At a joint meeting of the Jackson Municipal Hospital Board and
the City Council on Tuesday night, hospital board President Steve
Handke read letters of resignation by the hospital's chief
administrator, Sister Maureen McDonald, and the assistant
administrator and nursing director, Sister Patricia Glowski.
   The nuns are members of the Alma, Mich.-based Religious Sisters
of Mercy, which has run the 22-bed Jackson hospital since 1981. Two
members of a newly formed citizens committee were nominated Tuesday
to help the hospital board find replacements for the nuns.
   The resignations cited a desire to calm tensions that have risen
in the southern Minnesota community of 3,800 people since
obstetrics services were suspended Feb. 26 following a stillbirth
at the hospital.
   ``It's a relief,'' said Lance Edlin, a pharmacist and leader of
a citizens' group that had been trying to remove the nuns from
hospital management. ``I'm not surprised. We had 1,000 signatures
on a petition. We hope to get back to a harmonious relationship
now.''
   The nuns did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
   Meanwhile, Dr. Gumersindo Alvero, who was one of the hospital's
two staff doctors, announced Wednesday he was withdrawing his
resignation because of support from the community. The resignation
by the nuns means the hospital has been brought ``back to the
people, where it belongs,'' he said.
   Alvero, who has practiced here for 10 years, said the woman
involved in the stillbirth was not a patient of his, and said the
cause of the stillbirth remains confidential. But he maintained
that was not the key issue in the dispute.
   ``The issue was how they (hospital administration) discriminated
against me. They investigated without giving me a chance to talk
with the doctor who investigated the case,'' he said.
   The board said Monday that it had been informed that a ``serious
medical incident concerning patient treatment had arisen'' on Feb.
16.
   In such a case, normal hospital procedure requires a review, the
board's statement said. After the board and Alvero were advised,
the statement said, complete medical records were forwarded to Dr.
Robert A. Diamond, an officer of the governing board of the
Minnesota Obstetrical and Gynecological Society in Minneapolis, who
serves as consultant to the hospital.
   According to the report from Diamond, the mother was ``poorly
managed'' during her labor.
   Diamond said the mother should have been transferred to a
hospital in nearby Worthington when, according to the medical
records, she started exhibiting severe pregnancy-induced
hypertension four days prior to delivery. He also said the use of
fetal heart monitoring at Jackson Municipal Hospital had to be
improved.
   Edlin and others said there is no quarrel in Jackson with the
quality of health care. In fact, the hospital board released a
statement Tuesday night saying the sisters' management of the
hospital had been ``superior.''
   Residents at the Tuesday night meeting voiced concerns about
high staff turnover and an air of secrecy about the nuns.
   ``It's a mystique of secretiveness that's really got everyone in
town wondering who the heck they are and what got them coming
here,'' said John Sathe, owner of a funeral home in Jackson.

<HEAD>State Department Under Fire Over Japanese Fishing In US Waters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A State Department official said Wednesday the
administration would talk to the Soviet Union about reports of
Japanese vessels fishing illegally in waters off Alaska, but a
House committee chairman demanded more action.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries, told a congressional hearing that the Reagan
administration was still pressing the government of Japan for an
official explanation of an incident in which Japanese trawlers were
videotaped apparently fishing in American waters in the Bering Sea.
   ``I am personally disappointed that I am not able to provide the
subcommittee with a full report of the Japanese investigation,''
Wolfe said.
   Wolfe said an interagency task force was developing a ``U.S.
government position to help avoid a recurrence of this problem in
the future.''
   He said the United States will be holding bilateral talks with
the Soviet Union, which has its eastern-most tip on the Bering Sea,
later this month to discuss fisheries problems in the area.
   ``It's a good exercise,'' said Wolfe.
   ``It's a good exercise Mr. Ambassador,'' replied Rep. Don
Bonker, D-Wash.. ``But good grief, we want more than an exercise.
   ``It's been three months since the alleged illegal activity took
place and I'm wondering how long we will have to wait before
something is forthcoming.''
   Bonker, chairman of the subcommittee on international economic
policy and trade of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on
the State Department to ``greatly accelerate it's actions.
   ``I can promise you, if you don't do something we will.''
   American fishermen and the U.S. Coast Guard have suspected for
more than a year that foreign trawlers were entering the 200-mile
U.S. fishing zone under cover of darkness or in stormy weather to
fish illegally.
   Seven foreign trawlers, most of them thought to be Japanese,
were videotaped with their nets down 38 miles inside the U.S. zone
off Alaska. The tapes were taken from a private plane chartered by
a fishing industry group in early January.
   Bonker said he was considering legislation that would require
that foreign fishing vessels inform U.S. authorities before they
enter American waters.
   Wolfe said the administration would probably finish formulating
a policy within a month, but said the best deterrent to illegal
foreign fishing might be increased surveillance and enforcement by
the Coast Guard.

   President Reagan revisited the
University of Notre Dame on Wednesday and dedicated a new 22-cent
stamp in honor of Knute Rockne, telling students that the legendary
football coach's life exemplified ``the faith that makes things
happen.''
   It was Reagan's second visit as president to the Notre Dame
campus. On his earlier visit in 1981, he was reunited with Pat
O'Brien, who played the title role in the 1940 movie, ``Knute
Rockne, All-American,'' in which Reagan enjoyed one of the first
big successes of his Hollywood career.
   But Reagan first went to Notre Dame as a young sports announcer,
to broadcast a football game. Later, he returned with O'Brien and
other stars for the premiere of the Rockne film.
   Clips from the black and white picture, in which Reagan played
Notre Dame football star George Gipp, were played for the audience
in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center before Reagan's
arrival on Wednesday.
   The clips showed O'Brien, as Rockne, giving a pep talk to his
players at halftime of a 1928 game against Army, with the score
tied 0-0. Gipp had died eight years earlier, but the coach tells
his charges that on his deathbed the young athlete said, ``Some
time when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the
boys, tell them to go out there with all they got and win just one
for the Gipper.''
   In fact, Army went ahead in the third quarter, 6-0, but Notre
Dame went on to win the game, 12-6. Army was on the 1-yard line
with the tying touchdown as time ran out.
   Reagan told his audience that the role of Gipp ``was a young
actor's dream'' but that playing in a film about Rockne ``was more
than that'' to him.
   ``I know that, to many of you today, Rockne is a revered name, a
symbol of greatness and, yes, a face on a postage stamp,'' he said.
   ``But my generation, well, we actually knew the legend as it
happened _ we saw it unfold. And we felt it was saying something
important about us as a people and a nation.''
   ``Most of all, the Rockne legend meant this ... that on or off
the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is faith that
makes great things happen.''
   Rockne, a graduate of the men's college at Notre Dame, was its
head football coach from 1918 to 1931 and compiled a record of 108
victories, 12 losses and five ties. During his tenure, the
``Fighting Irish'' were undefeated in five seasons and won six
national championships.
   At the end of his speech, Reagan repeated the line from Gipp's
deathbed scene in the movie, saying, ``Win just one for the
Gipper.'' But he actully pronounced it ``Gippet,'' although few in
the crowd noticed the mistake because they already had begun their
applause.
   Afterward, Reagan was handed a football, which he hurled toward
a group of football players seated in the crowd. Heisman Trophy
winner Tim Brown caught the pigskin as the crowd roared its
approval.
   Reagan then unveiled a replica of the new postage stamp, which
shows Rockne in a jersey holding a football. As a 22-cent stamp, it
is unlikely to be widely used for long, since first-class letter
postage is due to go up to 25 cents next month.
   The ceremony ended when Reagan, a graduate of Eureka College in
Illinois and the holder of an honorary degree from Notre Dame, was
given a plaque bearing the words of the school song, ``Notre Dame,
Our Mother.'' He sang along softly as the song echoed through the
athletic center.
   In his speech, the president coupled his reminiscences about
Rockne with praise for the American economy, saying, ``There's a
will to succeed evident in our land.''
   ``It is a far different picture than the agonizing sight of a
decade ago, when many were counting out American workers and
American industry,'' he said.
   ``We were told Americans would no longer go the extra mile, no
longer had the drive to excel; that our country was in decline; and
that we, as a people, should lower our expectations.''
   ``Today, we see an America ready to compete, anxious to
compete,'' Reagan said.
   ``I predict that as this year progresses, we will see American
manufacturing re-emerge as the leading force in the world
marketplace.''
   Reagan also used the occasion to renew his claim, disputed by
some, that his administration, abetted by first lady Nancy Reagan's
``Just Say No'' campaign, is making significant inroads into drug
use among young people.
   ``We still have a long way to go, and when Nancy and I see
stories saying just that in the story, we welcome them,'' he said.
   ``But let's also remember that the shock of recognition is not a
sign of defeat, it's the beginning of victory.''
   The president tempered his customary optimism with the
observations that ``there are those who see a dark side to our
technological progress. ... It is pointed out that, regretfully, as
man has advanced into this new age, so has his capability to kill
and destroy.''
   But, he said, ``Technology is pointing toward a way out of this
dilemma'' with research on the space-based missile defense system.
The system, informally called ``Star Wars,'' is a cornerstone of
the Reagan national security policy.
   As he boarded Air Force One in South Bend for the trip back to
Washington, Reagan was carrying an autographed basketball presented
to him by Notre Dame basketball coach Digger Phelps.
   Reporters shouted at Reagan to toss the ball toward them, which
he did. NBC-TV reporter Chris Wallace caught it, lobbed a pass to a
member of the White House staff, who then presented it to Reagan.
   Reagan laughed as he reached the top platform of the stairs,
bounced the basketball once, grinned then entered the plane.
   The president arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, on the
outskirts of Washington, shortly before 4 p.m. EST and then
returned to the White House.

   Eleven Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee asked Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Wednesday to
step down temporarily until independent counsel investigations into
his conduct are completed.
   Meese spokesman Terry Eastland said the attorney general would
not comply because, ``No one should be urged to step down from a
government position simply because that person is under
investigation.''
   The lawmakers made their request in a letter to Meese, and five
of them held a news conference to elaborate on their remarks.
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, one of the signers, denied
that the signers had a political motive, saying, ``Ed Meese is the
best thing to happen to the Democratic Party.''
   Another signer, Rep. Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, said the
standard Meese is setting for ethical conduct is ``not in the
slammer.''
   Meese has been under criminal investigation by independent
counsel James McKay since last May 11. McKay has been examining
Meese's involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., and with a
$1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   McKay also has been examining the attorney general's involvement
with the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he owned
$14,000 in phone stock.
   In addition Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, investigating
the Iran-Contra arms and money affair, has called Meese before a
grand jury numerous times.
   ``We strongly believe that your increasing inability to spend
time on the day-to-day demands of your job, the deteriorating
morale at the Department of Justice and the continuing cloud over
your office are undermining your ability to act effectively as the
nation's chief law enforcement officer,'' the Democrats said in the
letter.
   The letter said the pending investigations ``detract from the
time required to properly administer the Department of Justice.
   ``The pervasive perception that you have allowed personal
considerations to encroach on your constitutional responsibilities
threatens to breed contempt for your office, your administration
and the rule of law itself,'' the lawmakers said.
   Eastland responded, ``This is an old idea, a politically
partisan idea and a thoroughly bad idea.''
   He said Meese ``has every intention of serving to the end of
this term. He has spent some time with his lawyers on the
investigation, but there has been no serious subtraction of his
time or effort from leadership of the Department of Justice.''
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., told the news conference that the
pipeline project may have involved an attempt by a U.S. company _
with Meese's knowledge _ to bribe foreign officials. Such bribes
would violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   ``At this moment, some business groups are conducting a major
drive to weaken the (act),'' Berman said. ``In that effort, they
have consistently been supported by this administration and by this
Justice Department.''
   The letter was signed by Reps. Dan Glickman, Kansas; Edward
Feighan, Ohio; Berman; Frank; Morrison; Lawrence Smith, Florida;
Harley Staggers Jr., West Virginia; John Conyers, Michigan; George
Crockett Jr., Michigan; Mike Synar, Oklahoma and Patricia
Schroeder, Colorado.

   Police in three states interviewed witnesses
Wednesday as they tried to identify two men sought in a
cold-blooded rampage that left four people dead, including a woman
whose throat was slit while she struggled with her assailants.
   Another victim, an 85-year-old man, was shot in the back of the
head, and his son was shot in the face. The fourth victim was shot
three times and then dumped by the side of an Arkansas road after
he gave two men a ride, authorities said.
   ``By all indications, it was overkill,'' said Cooke County
Sheriff John Aston, where the first of the victims, a 23-year-old
woman, was found in her Gainesville mobile home.
   Vehicles stolen from the victims turned up in lakes in Oklahoma
and Arkansas, authorities said, and items found with vehicles
linked the four killings.
   ``We do not have a motive at all,'' Aston said.
   ``We don't know where they are, not now,'' said Sgt. Anthony
Hancock of the Collin County sheriff's office. ``I would not say a
search is under way because we don't know where to look. We're
trying to compile information, compile artists' sketches. We're
trying to make an identification on these guys. We just don't know
which way to go.''
   Deana Andrews Woodard was killed Monday morning in her home in
Gainesville, just south of the Texas-Oklahoma line. Aston described
the slaying as cold-blooded.
   ``These people were there the whole time she was bleeding to
death,'' he said. ``There are indications there had been a
struggle. She was hit in the head.''
   Her infant son was in the home but was not harmed. The suspects
stole her gun and apparently drove her car to the Collin County
community of Farmersville, north of Dallas. There, the bodies of
Cecil Floyd Morrison and his son, Cecil Leonard Morrison, 62, were
found Monday night in their home, Hancock said.
   They had been brutally beaten with a tire iron or other tool,
and shot in the head or face, Hancock said.
   The men are believed to have abandonded Mrs. Woodard's car near
Farmersville and to have stolen the Morrisons' pickup truck. Mrs.
Woodard's car has not been recovered.
   They then drove the pickup truck to the Hope-Saratoga, Ark.,
area and drove it into a lake, Hancock said.
   The men went to a home in the area to ask for assistance after
dark Monday, and the fourth victim offered them a ride, Hancock
said.
   The body of Kenneth Olden, 34, of Arkansas, was found about 9
a.m. Tuesday on a rural road outside Saratoga, authorities said.
   ``They left him on a roadside and drove his vehicle back to
Marietta, Oklahoma, where that vehcile was discovered somewhere
before noon Tuesday,'' Hancock said. Marietta is just north of the
Texas-Oklahoma line.
   A checkbook taken from the men in Farmersville, two gold
necklaces and a prescription bottle with Mrs. Woodard's name on it
were found with the vehicle in Arkansas, Hancock said.
   Authorities said they were trying to determine whether the
killings were linked to the robbery by three men of a Seminole,
Okla., bank Monday. The FBI recovered most of the stolen cash in
Muskogee, Okla.

   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee says Congress will not enact a bill to define insider
trading, although the securities industry is seeking such
legislation.
   ``The definition that has developed in case law is clear,'' Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., said in a speech this week to the Securities
Industry Association.
   Reporters were not invited to the lobby group's meeting in
Washington on Monday, but Dingell's office released a copy of his
remarks on Wednesday.
   The offense of insider trading has developed over the years
through court and regulatory interpretations of fraud and
securities laws.
   The securities industry has been pushing Congress to write a
definition into the law, arguing that traders need to know
beforehand what constitutes insider trading in order to avoid
violating the law.
   Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., in June introduced a bill with a definition. They have been
working with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which favors
legislation but has suggested changes in the Senate bill to broaden
the definition.
   However, in the House, Dingell told the lobby group flatly,
``There will be no definition of insider trading.''
   He said his committee is drafting a bill that would ``implement
needed reforms'' and promised ``we will work toward passage this
year.''
   He did not elaborate what reforms would be in the bill, beyond
advising the association that ``you will probably dislike some of
them.''
   Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Dingell, said the chairman
favors additional penalties for insider trading. He also wants
harsher treatment for violations of internal ``Chinese wall''
barriers designed to prevent executives in a securities firm
involved in mergers and aquisitions from communicating with traders
in the same firm, Fitzgibbons said.
   Fitzgibbons said Dingell is not philosophically opposed to
legislating a definition, but recognizes the difficulty of getting
Congress to agree on one and is comfortable with the definition
developed by the courts.
   Donald J. Crawford, a senior vice president for the securities
association, said the group has endorsed a statutory definition but
believes there is some validity to Dingell's arguments.
   In a related matter, Dingell critized a bill passed last week by
the Senate Banking Committee that would permit banks to underwrite
most securities, except corporate stocks.
   Dingell said the bill provided insufficient safeguards against
conflicts between banks' role as lenders and what would become
their new role as a securities underwriters.
   The bill ``has emerged ... with firewalls as thin as rice
paper,'' he said.

   George Bush grabbed the lion's share of the overseas headlines
after his string of Super Tuesday victories, with much of the press
portraying him as a low-key Reagan loyalist with one foot in the
White House door.
   ``Why is Bush so popular? The answer comes easily,'' said the
independent tabloid Expressen, Sweden's largest-circulation paper.
``Party people see him as Ronald Reagan's loyal aid _ loyal to the
grave _ and therefore his natural successor.''
   The vice president's Republican primary victories in 16 states
grabbed more media coverage than the more muddled outcomes on the
Democratic side, although Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis got
huge display in his ancestral country, Greece, and Jesse Jackson
drew strong coverage.
   ``Jesse Jackson, the one-time `leftist radical,' has become a
... kingmaker with a strong influence on the Democratic program and
on the ultimate choice of the presidential candidate,'' the
independent Amsterdam newspaper, Het Parool, noted in an editorial.
   Poland's state-run radio, in a commentary read during the midday
news, drew parallels between Bush and Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   Gore, it said, ``originates from a well-to-do family, graduated
from elite universities, and his life, including the political one,
has been happy,'' it said.
   ``This moderate conservative from the South describes himself as
the toughest among the Democrats as far as military issues are
concerned. His political profile therefore offers no contrast to
Bush's...''
   Prevailing foreign sentiment attributed Bush's big day to
President Reagan. The British papers seemed ready to announce an
inauguration.
   ``White House Here I Come,'' shouted the the banner headline in
the Standard of London, which ran a photo of an exhilarated Bush
waving to supporters.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole was shown rubbing his brow in a
photograph captioned ``Feeling the Pain.''
   ``By a stunning series of triumphs, grinding his rivals to dust
beneath his chariot wheels in the Super Tuesday primaries, George
Bush emerged almost invincible as the next presidential candidate
of the Republican Party,'' the Standard rhapsodized.
   In West Germany, the Bonn-based newspaper Die Welt said:
``George Bush's impressive victory is without doubt the most
important event of the primary elections.
   ``This was not just a victory for George Bush, it was a triumph
for Ronald Reagan.''
   In Greece, where the Dukakis campaign has been followed closely,
the media trumpeted his victories in five Democratic primaries.
``Dukakis Triumphs, All Consider Him A Certain President,'' said a
banner headline in the conservative daily Messimvrini.
   A front-page article in the Soviet-government newspaper Izvestia
in Moscow said Super Tuesday appears to have decided the Republican
contest, but only raised more questions about who will emerge as
the Democratic contender in November.
   Dukakis, Jackson and Gore ``practically split up among
themselves the states where elections were held,'' the newspaper
said.
   Izvestia quoted ``a prominent Democratic figure who didn't want
his name used'' in speculating that his party might run a ticket
pairing Dukakis with Jackson.
   In contrast with past coverage, reports issued this week by the
official Tass news agency were notable for their balance and
clarity.
   Both Tass and Izvestia noted the poor showings by Republicans
Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson, ``who had been conducting their
campaigns from extreme right positions.''
   But the leftist French daily Le Monde of Paris, in an editorial,
summed up the whole process this way:
   ``It will take hundreds of millions of dollars, thousands of
kilometers, countless hours of television, to realize (that) hopes
have been disappointed, careers destroyed and contestants
hopelessly plunged into debt before there is the slightest idea or
the vaguest program'' put forward by the candidates.
   Le Monde said there was an ideological vacuum on the Democratic
side, with the exception of Jackson and his ``out-of-date
liberalism.''
   Rome's moderate Il Messsaggero, said in its headline: ``Bush Did
It. Beating Dole, He Has Become the Political Heir of Reagan.''
   State-run RAI-TV spent nearly five minutes explaining the
process before giving the results Wednesday morning.

   Buoyed by a heavy vote in Claiborne
County, Ed Pittman was within reach of winning the Democratic
nomination in a Mississippi Supreme Court race.
   Problem was, elections officials had forgotten that Claiborne
County wasn't part of the district any longer.
   ``I would have loved to win the first time, but as a matter of
fact when you have three worthy opponents you don't anticipate
winning the first day,'' the former attorney general said Wednesday.
   He will face attorney John Swartzfager in the March 29 runoff.
   Swartzfager said he was shocked by the snafu, and blamed it
partly on Pittman.
   Pittman was the state attorney general when the redistricting
plan was approved in December, Swartzfager said, ``and he should
have notified the secretary of state and the Democratic Party.''
   Final but unofficial returns without Claiborne County showed
Pittman with 49 percent of the vote in the Supreme Court's Southern
District and Swartzfager with 21 percent.
   Including Claiborne County, where Pittman won by 1,554 to 107,
his unofficial total was about 50 percent. A runoff is required if
a candidate receives less than 50 percent.
   ``The bottom line is they may have voted in the Southern
District but they are not in that district,'' said John Emfinger of
the Attorney General's office. ``The next step will be up to the
party.''
   Emfinger said the Legislature had moved the county as part of a
redistricting plan last year.
   Brian Martin, executive director of the Mississippi Democratic
Party, said the mistake would have no impact on the Central
District, where Claiborne County belongs and where two incumbent
justices had no opposition Tuesday.
   ``We received the sample ballot from the (state) party and our
Democratic Executive Committee had the ballot made up exactly as it
was sent to us,'' said Sammie Good, the Claiborne County circuit
clerk. ``We are very disappointed our votes will not count and I'm
sure Ed Pittman is disappointed.''

<HEAD>Absorbent Material Helps To Counter Citrus Root Weevils</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An absorbent material called super slurper is
helping tiny worms to kill root weevils that threaten citrus trees,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   William J. Schroeder, an entomolgist in the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said the super slurper keeps soil
moist so that the microscopic worms, or nematodes, can survive and
kill weevils which chew the tree roots.
   In tests, 60 percent of the weevils were killed, compared with
only 25 percent without the help of the worms. Schroeder said that
weevils can kill up to 30 percent of the trees in a grove if not
controlled.
   The nematodes haven't been used before as a natural weevil
control because they die quickly if soil dries out, Schoeder said.
   Other agency scientists are looking into the use of super
slurper and nematodes to see if they can control pests of corn and
vegetables.
   Agency scientists in Peoria, Ill., invented the cornstarch-based
super slurper 14 years ago. It has been successfully used in dozens
of commercial products, including body powder, medical dressings
and many other items.
   Schroeder, who works at the department's horticultural research
laboratory in Orlando, Fla., said he thought of super slurper in
1985 when he observed nematodes dying in dry soil.
   Companies could mass-produce nematodes and ``package billions of
them alive'' for sale to growers, who then could mix the worms with
super slurper for application on tree roots before planting, he
said.
   For citrus groves already inhabited by the beneficial nematodes,
Schroeder said he is looking into the possibility of injecting
super slurper into the soil with a nozzle.
   The tiny worms, which survive as long as the soil is kept moist,
penetrate the weevils and release lethal bacteria, which don't harm
plants or other organisms, Schroeder said.

<HEAD>Jackson Returns to Chicago, Predicts Hot Illinois Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ss Writer=
   CHICAGO (AP) _ Jesse Jackson returned to his home base on
Wednesday, fresh from his strong showing on Super Tuesday, and
predicted a ``hotly contested race'' in next week's Illinois
primary.
   ``I will do well in Illinois,'' he told reporters. But he also
said he anticipated a tough fight with Illinois Sen. Paul Simon,
who sat out the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses across 20
states.
   Jackson reaped more than 300 delegates, coming in second overall
to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson placed first in the popular vote for the day, with 27
percent to 26 percent each for Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee.
   But that was a total for all the states. The delegates are
alloted state-by-state depending on the votes each candidate wins
in each state, not how many they win regionwide.
   Jackson's campaign staff pointed to exit polls showing he had
won the Hispanic vote, the women's vote and the 18-to-21 age group.
   The exit polls indicated Jackson won about 95 percent of the
black vote and about 10 percent of the white vote across the Super
Tuesday states.
   Jackson came in third in Texas, and to put the best face on that
showing in a state where he campaigned vigorously, his aides said
he had spent only $30,000 on TV there, a fraction of what was spent
by his opponents.
   Campaign official Steve Cobble said polling showed that Jackson
did well in the places that he appeared personally, as in the case
of Beaumont, Texas, where he went to show solidarity with striking
oil workers.
   Jackson talked repeatedly Wednesday about how he was outspent by
the multi-million dollar TV campaigns of Dukakis, Gore and Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   ``My opponents have money, and money is powerful, but we the
people are more powerful,'' he told a rally of plant workers in the
Chicago suburb of Cicero. ``We get stronger every day.''
   His campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said the Jackson campaign
will be buying TV ads as new money comes in. Jackson spent $100,000
on TV in the Super Tuesday contests.
   In South Carolina, Jackson's boyhood state where voting occurs
Saturday, Austin said the TV budget is about $20,000. In Illinois,
Austin anticipates a total budget of $200,000, with about $30,000
for television.
   Jackson has been a political force in Chicago for many years
starting when he worked with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. for
open housing and other civil rights causes. Jackson makes his home
here, and his Operation PUSH, People United to Serve Humanity, is
based here.
   Upon arriving home Wednesday, Jackson went to Cicero to speak at
an outdoor rally of about 150 General Electric workers who are
upset because of plans to close down a refrigerator plant where
more than 1,000 people work.
   ``Jesse, help us save our jobs,'' their placards read.
   Jackson said he was challenging GE to meet with workers and him
to discuss ways of converting the plant to other uses.
   Earlier, at a news conference in Houston, he said the primary
elections are muting Democratic Party establishment doubts about
the viability of his campaign.
   But he said many white Democratic politicians who were elected
with support from black voters he helped bring into the party had
failed to endorse him.
   ``It would be fair to say that many of them had reasonable
doubts about the success of our campaign,'' he said. ``In these
elections we are removing those doubts. ... Our coalition
represents the future of the Democratic Party.''
   He said white officials must assess not only who can win, but
which candidate ``can help them.''
   He decried the negative ads his opponents ran against one
another, and said the Democrats must not ``self-destruct'' their
chances for winning the White House in November.
   Although Jackson so far has not been attacked by his rivals,
Austin said the Jackson camp is prepared to face ``slings and
arrows'' now that he is amassing delegates.

<HEAD>Bush Supporters Hope Texas Win Dispels `Wimp' Image; Dukakis
Prevails</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis organized early and spent big to
tell Texas voters that the economic program dubbed the
``Massachusetts Miracle'' could mean jobs and tax breaks for them.
He succeeded, convincingly.
   Supporters of Vice President George Bush, meanwhile, said they
hoped the former Texas resident's sweep of all 111 state Republican
delegates on Super Tuesday dispelled the ``wimp'' issue.
   ``He's the best of what Texas is,'' said Margaret Wolf, who
served as Bush's secretary in 1977-78. Bush, a Massachusetts native
who keeps a voting address at a Houston hotel, was ``gutsy'' for
starting his own oil business in Texas in 1953, she said.
   Dukakis, who says he helped spur his state's economic revival as
governor, ``ran a good campaign'' to defeat Jesse Jackson by 33
percent to 24 percent of the primary vote, said George Christian, a
former press secretary to Lyndon Johnson and an Austin political
consultant.
   ``He had the strategy of finding his constituency and organizing
it. His constituency was the Hispanics and liberals. That was a
sufficient number to put him at the top,'' Christian said.
   In contrast to a Dukakis advertising blitz that cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars, Jackson spent about $20,000 on Texas ads but
used volunteers to build his No. 2 spot among Democrats, said his
campaign secretary, Steve Coble.
   With 6,534 of 6,933 precincts or 94 percent reporting, Dukakis
had 533,076 votes, Jackson had 387,440, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
received 334,365 or 14 percent and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
finished with 225,770 or 14 percent.
   Dukakis earned an estimated 45 delegates and Jesse Jackson was
expected to capture 44. Gore had 26 delegates and Gephardt tallied
9.
   In the Republican primary, with 5,238 of 5,616 precincts or 93
percent reporting, Bush amassed 588,081 votes or 64 percent.Former
TV evangelist Pat Robertson was a distant second with 141,444 votes
and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 125,702 or 14 percent.
   In other races, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen easily won
renomination in his bid for a fourth term. Top Republican
challengers Beau Boulter, who gave up his congressional seat for
the Senate race, and Wes Gilbreath, a Houston investor making his
first race for a political office, will meet in a runoff on April
12.

   A slow-moving cold front set off showers Wednesday through the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys and along the Gulf Coast, where more
than 3 inches of rain drenched central Louisiana in 24 hours.
   Heavy rain also fell in the Pacific Northwest, and up to 5
inches of snow were expected in Washington's Cascade and Olympic
mountains.
   Temperatures climbed to record highs in North Dakota, while much
of Texas had readings in the 60s and 70s.
   Rainshowers were scattered from western New England into the
upper Ohio Valley and from Virginia through the eastern Carolinas
into northern Florida.
   Northeast Michigan got a dusting of snow.
   In Louisiana, more than an 3 inches of rain were measured in 24
hours at Oakdale, Bunkie, Eunice and Alexandria. Lake Charles got
more than an inch.
   More than 3 inches were recorded in 24 hours in Washington at
Spada Lake and Verlot.
   Snow and blowing dust hindered travel across northwest Nevada,
reducing visibility to less than a mile. Winds gusted to 36 mph at
Tonopah, Nev.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 0.70 inch at McComb, Miss., 0.65 inch at Gainesville,
Fla., and Charleston, S.C., 0.49 inch at Crescent City, Calif.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 26 degrees at Limestone,
Maine, Gunnison, Colo., and Elko, Nev., to 83 degrees at Avon Park,
Fla. The morning low for the nation was 5 degrees below zero at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Record high temperatures included 58 in Bismarck, N.D., 60 in
Dickinson, N.D., and 56 at Williston, N.D.
   Thursday's forecast called for rainshowers along the middle and
southern Atlantic Coast, with showers and a few thunderstorms
across the Florida Peninsula; rain across the northeast Plains and
the central Intermountain region; snow across the northern Rockies
and high Plains into the Colorado Rockies, and gusty wind from the
desert Southwest into the southern Rockies and from the Carolinas
into northern Florida.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 50s or 60s across
much of the nation, with readings in the 30s and 40s from the
northern Plateau and central Intermountain region through the
northern Rockies, the northern Plains, the Great Lakes and upper
Ohio Valley into New England; in the 70s across the southern coast
of California, the southern Plateau, the southern Plains and the
lower Mississippi Valley as well as much of Florida, and in the low
to mid-80s across western and southern Texas.

<TEXT>
   The world's cities must be more than
simply places to do business: They must strive to meet the higher
human aspirations of their citizens, experts attending an
international conference on cities agreed Wednesday.
   ``It's more than a tax base. It's more than buildings. It's
aiming to make the city enjoyable for those citizens who have the
least,'' Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. told the
International Conference on Making Cities Liveable.
   About 300 experts from around the globe are attending the
conference which runs through this weekend. Social policy and
values as they apply to cities were the topics of the opening
session.
   ``If we can give homes rather than housing projects, if we can
create types of beauty everyone can enjoy ... then we are on our
way to making cities liveable,'' said Riley, who showed slides of
rehabilitation and restoration projects he said has given
Charleston an international reputation.
   Eduardo Salzano, a professor at the University of Venice in
Italy, said modern cities are confronted with ``a cluttered mass of
individual interests.''
   He suggested planning should be in the hands of local boards
that have adequate citizen input, and residents of cities must
agree ownership of urban land does not automatically give the owner
the right to build anything he wants.
   ``A sense of place is a human hunger'' which many modern cities
don't satisfy, said Don Robert Johnson, a New York scholar. He
added that ``individuals without a sense of history are incapable
of planning the present and the future in an informed manner.''
   The mayor of Erlangen, West Germany, Dietmar Hahlweg, said
cities need strong planning authority and the right to take land
when needed for public purposes.
   Cities also need enlightened leadership and ``people who have
the necessary knowledge and have a feeling for the wishes, needs
and problems of the people,'' he said.
   Planners must also consider the needs of the elderly and
children, said Suzanne Lennard, one of the organizers of the
conference.
   She said liveable cities have some sort of unity. Cities in the
United States ``have grown cancerously'' with a wide separation of
shopping areas and neighborhoods and ``a lack of order or reason in
the sequence of streets and places,'' she said.
   ``A community cannot be said to exist in a series of pockets of
persons wishing to know only those in their own group and shunning
contact with others,'' she said.
   William Whyte of the American Conservation Association in New
York suggested many American cities fear ``undesirables'' and
``bustle with distrust'' of some of their citizens.
   He noted that in some cities, park benches are cut short to make
it hard for people to sleep on them. In other metropolitan areas,
it's virtually impossible to find a public rest room in the center
of the city, he said.
   In some large downtown development projects featuring hotels or
shopping arcades, benches are omitted to discourage
``undesirables,'' he said.
   Many such projects are financed in part through tax money, he
said.
   ``These things the public has an equity in and it should be
mandatory they can be used by the public,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prospects Dim For Democrat To Lock Up Nomination During Primary
Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic presidential candidates on
Wednesday found themselves stuck in a logjam of delegates in which
nobody was likely to lock up the party's nomination when the
primaries end in June.
   ``Mathematically and politically this process is in gridlock,''
said Terry Michael, spokesman for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who
suffered a shutout in Super Tuesday's round of primaries and
caucuses.
   Simon, who held just 35.5 delegates both before and after
Tuesday's balloting, is banking on nobody being able to gain the
2,082 delegates needed to win the Democratic presidential
nomination when the primaries conclude on June 7, with California
and New Jersey, two of the largest states with a total of 423
delegates at stake.
   ``The person or persons with the greatest potential to negotiate
his way to a first-ballot victory will be the candidate who is
hottest at the end,'' Michael said.
   The odds are growing longer that any candidate can come up with
the magic number needed to win on the first ballot at the
Democratic convention in Atlanta.
   The Democrats have yet to allocate 2,524 of their national
convention delegates, and another 258.65 delegates list themselves
as uncommitted. Thus the available pool of delegates to be won
between now and early June would be 2,782.65.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who was leading the field of
Democratic candidates with 456.5 delegates, needs to win another
1625.5 delegates to wrap up the presidential nomionation. Or, put
another way, he has to win more than 58 percent of all the
delegates that are still left to be won _ roughly twice as well as
he's done so far.
   Dukakis was followed in the delegate count by Rev. Jesse Jackson
with 395.55 and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore with 346.8.
   The three-way tie in the Democratic race prompted former
President Jimmy Carter to observe that ``I think it's accurate to
say the chances are less likely that one of the candidates will
arrive in Atlanta with a clear majority.''
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday he wanted to see his
party hold a ``quiet convention,'' although he conceded it would be
difficult for any of the current candidates to secure a
first-ballot victory based on results of the primaries and caucuses.
   Cuomo said he had talked to Democratic National Committee
Chairman Paul Kirk about the problem last week.
   ``I believe what you, Paul Kirk, should do is try, right after
California and New Jersey, the last primaries, to take whoever is
ahead and make that person the concensus choice,'' Cuomo said as he
recalled the conversation.
   Michael said if no candidate holds a majority by the time the
primaries conclude, the rule of conscience that binds delegates to
the candidates will begin to bend and break.
   However, Jude Barry, an aide to Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt's
presidential campaign, disagreed, saying, ``I think there's going
to be loyalty and commitment. We're prepared to protect what we
have, as I'm sure the other candidates will as well.''
   Gephardt, who had 143 delegates after Super Tuesday, is hoping
to hang on with a strong showing in the Michigan caucuses on March
26 and the congressional Democratic caucuses on April 19 and 20.
Gephardt is planning on winning big when his House colleagues pick
210 of their own to be national convention delegates. Another 43
delegates will be picked by Senate Democrats.
   ``Our hand certainly will not be weak with that wild card,''
Barry said.
   Simon, meanwhile, is hoping to score a victory next Tuesday in
his home state of Illinois.

   A ``violently crazy'' man bent on revenge
after being convicted of reckless driving and weapons violations
returned to the courtroom Wednesday and opened fire, wounding a
bailiff before being slain, officials said.
   Jeremey Sigmond, 35, a decertified chiropractor who had claimed
during his trial that he thought the Mafia was following him, died
in a shootout at Municipal Court in suburban Van Nuys, said Ted
Goldstein, a spokesman for the city attorney's office.
   Sigmond had held a gun to the head of the deputy city attorney
who prosecuted the case, Jessica Perrin Silvers, 48. She broke
loose when he was momentarily distracted and was unharmed,
Goldstein said.
   ``I realized he now apparently regarded me as part of the same
conspiracy that involves the Mafia, the governor, the governor's
cousin, the district attorney, the city attorney's office, and all
the rest,'' Ms. Silvers said. ``I know that makes me start sounding
like the crazy one when I say it.''
   ``He's just, in layman's terms, violently crazy, and I knew
it,'' she said.
   The wounded bailiff, county Deputy Marshal Cliff Wofford, 30, of
Palmdale, was in stable condition at St. Joseph's Medical Center in
Burbank, said hospital spokeswoman Linda Roberts. He was shot in
the abdomen.
   Sigmond, of Sepulveda, was convicted in the same courtroom
Tuesday of four misdemeanors _ reckless driving, evading police,
carrying a loaded weapon and carrying a concealed weapon _ stemming
from a chase, Goldstein said. He was awaiting sentencing.
   When Sigmond was arrested in October, he was wearing two
bulletproof vests and a crash helmet and carrying a .38-caliber
revolver loaded with five rounds of armor-piercing ammunition,
officers said.
   He testified he thought he was being chased by the Mafia instead
of the California Highway Patrol. He claimed the Mafia was
harassing him in retaliation for a suit he filed against the Board
of Chiropractors, alleging price-fixing and restraint of trade.
   Sigmond was also appealing the revocation of his state license
to practice as a chiropractor.
   Sigmond accosted Ms. Silvers on Wednesday minutes after she
arrived at the courthouse. She said he commandeered her into the
courtroom.
   A bailiff pulled a gun on Sigmond, but he countered: ``Drop or
I'll kill both of you,'' said Jim Epstein, a lawyer and friend of
the prosecutor.
   The bailiff threw her gun behind Sigmond, and as he reached for
the weapon, Ms. Silvers broke loose and locked herself in a
restroom, Epstein said.
   The man, waving both guns, then went toward Municipal Judge
Michael B. Harwin, screaming ``something like `I want my new day in
court,''' said George Schell, a deputy city attorney in the
courtroom.
   The judge started wrestling with the gunman, trying to disarm
him. A second bailiff, Wofford, then rushed into the room and both
he and Sigmond were wounded in the ensuing shootout, officials said.
   Though fatally wounded, Sigmond continued to struggle with the
judge and a bailiff who were trying to handcuff him, Schell said.
Ms. Silvers said 13 casings were found around the judge's bench.
   At his sentencing, which was scheduled for May, Sigmond could
have been sent to jail for up to 18 months.
   One witness outside the courtroom, Becker Mubani, said that
after the shooting he saw Wofford running from the courtroom, ``his
left hand covering the wound.''
   The officer staggered down some steps to the sidewalk as other
officers ran to assist him. Mubani screamed, ``Watch! Watch! He's
wounded!''
   ``Then the wounded officer began shouting, `Where is the
ambulance? Where is the ambulance?''' Mubani said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Meets With Ethnic Leaders to Discuss Unrest</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4 grafs for grafs 5-6 pvs: `The Tass ...' to UPDATE with
report of meeting in Yerevan.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Kremlin officials
met Wednesday with leaders of the republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan to discuss how to resolve ethnic unrest that has killed
at least 32 people, Tass said.
   The report said party leaders Kyamran Bagirov of Azerbaijan and
Karen Demirchyan of Armenia met with the Soviet leader, Soviet
President Andrei A. Gromyko, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and two
other influential Politburo members, Yegor K. Ligachev and
Alexander N. Yakovlev.
   The conference involving the party's top echelon illustrated the
Kremlin's concern over the ethnic strife that has cracked the
facade of cohesion among the Soviet Union's more than 100
nationalities.
   In its report on the meeting at the party's Central Committee
headquarters, Tass said the situation in the republics ``is
returning to normal, although it continues to have its
difficulties.''
   Meanwhile, an Armenian who described himself as a city official
loyal to the Soviet government called The Associated Press from the
Armenian capital of Yerevan to report that city officials from
throughout the republic had gathered Wednesday to appeal to
authorities in Moscow for support.
   ``This is not a nationalist or an extremist action,'' said
Gamlet Kocharyan, who said he was a member of the governing council
of the city of Kafan. He said the Armenians' effort to annex a
section of the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan was legal and
deserved the central government's attention.
   He said the appeal was adopted unanimously by 1,500 delegates at
the meeting in Yerevan and would be sent to Moscow. It also asked
the national party Central Committee to reprimand Soviet media for
inaccurate and incomplete reporting on the ethnic disturbances, he
said.
   The Tass report on the Kremlin meeting, which was the top item
on the national news program ``Vremya,'' said public order was
being observed and that schools and businesses were open in
Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   Tass said the officials discussed ``the situation taking shape
in these republics in connection with the events in
Nagorno-Karabakh.''
   Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-dominated region of Azerbaijan
that Armenians want to be annexed to their republic.
   Tensions between Armenians and Azeris erupted in violence Feb.
28 in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov said 32 people were killed in the rioting.
   At a news briefing, Gerasimov said ``the situation is normal,
but passions are still running high since people still remember
what happened.''
   The Soviet government has blamed the killings on ``hooligans''
provoked by rumors of ethnic turmoil elsewhere. But some Armenian
activists claim the death toll is much higher and that the violence
was instigated by Azeris out of ethnic hatred.
   Gorbachev issued an appeal last month to both ethnic groups to
cease fighting and work together to resolve the territorial dispute.
   Tass said the Armenian and Azeri officials who met with
Gorbachev declared their peoples' support for an orderly approach
to determining the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Earlier, Armenian nationalists called on the Politburo to
protect their countrymen from attacks by Azeris and said they plan
a general strike later this week.
   Hovik Vassilian, a nationalist in Yerevan, said Armenians fear
their Azeri neighbors will resort to violence during a March 18-23
holiday observed by Shiite Moslems.
   Azeris are predominantly Shiite Moslem, while most Armenians are
Christian.
   Vassilian also said that hundreds of thousands of Armenians
staged a demonstration Tuesday in Yerevan to mourn countrymen
killed in the ethnic turmoil.
   Gerasimov confirmed that a demonstration took place at Yerevan's
memorial to Armenian victims of the 1915 Turkish invasion, but said
he did not know how many people participated.

<HEAD>Airport X-Ray Machines To Detect Illegal Food Imports</HEAD>

   Inspectors at 11 U.S. international airports
who guard against agricultural pests and diseases are being
equipped with X-ray machines to detect illegal sausages, mangoes
and other contraband, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   ``Imported meats can carry exotic diseases that could devastate
American livestock,'' said James W. Glosser, head of the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inpection Service. ``Fruits
and vegetable coming into the country can carry pests that could
seriously damage American crops.''
   Agency inspectors have used X-ray equipment in Puerto Rico and
Hawaii for departures for several years, with interceptions of
prohibited agricultural items doubling, he said.
   The new systems for arrivals were recently installed at
international airports in Miami, Honolulu, Luis Munoz International
in Puerto Rico, Houson and Chicago.
   Additional equipment soon will be installed at international
airports in Atlanta, New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Washington D.C.
   The USDA agency also is installing large signs at the 11
airports telling travelers that X-rays are being used to check
their baggage.
   ``Although most people willingly declare their agricultural
products, we do come across some intentional violators,'' Glosser
said. ``That's only natural, considering that we encountered an
estimated 43 million air travelers in 1987. Some ignore the
regulations and others are not even aware of them, despite all our
information efforts.''
   Glosser said the agency uses several methods to find smuggled
agricultural items, including trained beagles to sniff out illegal
imports.
   ``Finally, we rely on the deterrent effect of penalties,'' he
said. ``We fine violators $25 to $50, payable on the spot. We
currently collect about $30,000 per month, and we have collected
nearly $1.8 million since 1984. Fines are deposited in the U.S.
Treasury.''

   Bowing to a British demand, the Panamanian
ambassador agreed to waive his diplomatic immunity Wednesday and be
questioned by police over a raid he authorized on his country's
consulate, the embassy said.
   ``We haven't done anything wrong,'' embassy spokesman Geronimo
de Obaldia said of the Monday night raid, in which British security
guards hired by the embassy crashed a Land Rover through the glass
doors of Panama's London consulate and occupied it.
   ``No one was hurt, there was some glass broken and that's it,''
de Obaldia told The Associated Press.
   An embassy statement said Ambassador Guillermo Vega told the
Foreign Office in a letter Wednesday he ``and relevant members of
his staff ... are ready to be interviewed by the authorities in
respect of the events of March 7 at the consulate.''
   The Foreign Office, however, considered Vega's response
``unclear and inadequate,'' summoned him for the third time in two
days and gave him 24 hours to provide a ``definite response,'' said
a spokesman, who under British procedure declined to be identified.
   Vega supports Panamanian military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who arranged the ouster of President Eric Delvalle on Feb.
26. Consul Eduardo Arango, whose Fleet Street offices were seized,
is loyal to Delvalle.
   The Foreign Office had set a deadline for the Panamanians to
waive diplomatic immunity and hinted that Vega might be expelled if
he refused.
   De Obaldia told the AP the embassy announcement meant the
ambassador waived diplomatic immunity for himself and other
diplomats.
   Under international law, diplomats cannot be charged with
criminal offenses or questioned by police unless they waive
immunity.
   Besides Vega, the Foreign Office said police want to question
embassy counselor Jorge E. Constantino, who allegedly accompanied
the raiders or was nearby, and any other diplomats involved.
   Seven Britons employed by the security firm which Vega hired for
the raid were arrested and charged with public order offenses. They
have no diplomatic protection.
   Panama's ambassador to the European Economic Community, Angel.
E. Riera, also a Delvalle loyalist, meanwhile said Noriega
supporters broke into his office in Strasbourg, France, on
Wednesday.
   Riera said the raiders, led by a Panamanian colonel, smashed the
office door, searched for money and left when they found none.
   The tough British response to the London raid underlined
Conservative government insistence that London streets not be
turned into battlegrounds for internal disputes in foreign
countries.
   Control of Panamana's Washington embassy is also in dispute
following Noriega's takeover.
   Delvalle was ousted hours after demanding that Noriega resign
following his February indictment in Florida on drug trafficking
charges.

   A top State Department official headed for
Moscow Wednesday to explain to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze what the United States is doing to get peace talks
started in the Middle East.
   The State Department said that Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy left Washington Tuesday night headed for Moscow,
with a brief stopover in Brussels to brief the U.S. NATO allies on
the American Mideast peace plan.
   Murphy's talks in Moscow are designed to prepare Shevardnadze
for his visit to Washington on March 22, when he and Secretary of
State George P. Shultz will discuss how best to advance the Mideast
initiative.
   The two men already discussed the Mideast situation when Shultz
visited Moscow last month prior to undertaking a shuttle between
Jordan, Egypt and Israel to present his plan.
   The plan reportedly calls for Israel and its Arab neighbors to
launch talks by May 1 on a three-year autonomy period for the 1.5
million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. The sides
would begin talks on a long-term solution to the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip in December.
   The United States is seeking Soviet support for the plan in an
effort to enlist the backing of the Arabs, especially those closely
allied with the Kremlin like Syria.
   The Shultz plan calls for the Soviets to join England, France,
China and the United States in overseeing the talks.
   Murphy is also scheduled to stop in Rome, Paris and Bonn as part
of the U.S. effort to ensure a broad base of support for the
initiative which was sparked by three months of Israeli-Palestinian
clashes which have left more than 80 Arabs dead.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is due in Washington next
week, but he is not expected to bring an Israeli response to his
plan, despite such a demand from Shultz.
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, objects to an
international conference out of concern that such a forum will
pressure Israel into giving up occupied lands.
   Instead, Shamir will propose an agreement with Jordan on a
step-by-step plan for implementing self-rule quickly in a limited
area of the West Bank or Gaza.

<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army crews Wednesday retrieved the
last eight bodies of 17 soldiers killed when two helicopters on a
night training mission collided, then plunged 250 feet to the
ground and caught fire.
   The UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from Fort Campbell spewed
wreckage for hundreds of yards and charred the partially wooded,
gently rolling site six miles from the choppers' air field Tuesday
night.
   ``One aircraft is located in the trees. One aircraft is right on
the edge of a clearing,'' said Maj. Randy Schoel, Fort Campbell
spokesman.
   It was the worst Army aviation disaster since 248 soldiers based
at Fort Campbell were killed in 1985 in the crash of a chartered
plane in Gander, Newfoundland, Schoel said.
   The Blackhawk, one of the newer helicopters used by the Army,
Air Force and Marine Corps, has been grounded four times in three
years. Last summer officials said about 40 people had been killed
in crashes of the helicopter since 1978.
   ``I would say now there is no indication of any mechanical
factor'' in the crash, said Chief Warrant Officer Joe Adams of the
investigation team from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.
``We are looking at human and environmental factors. The human
factors might include some restriction of vision.''
   Four bodies were taken from the wreckage of each helicopter
Wednesday, Schoel said.
   Schoel said the crash occurred on the western Kentucky-Tennessee
border during a ``routine night mission,'' and left no survivors.
   ``Obviously, there's an element of risk in everything we do. We
train up to a standard that reduces that risk to an absolute
minimum,'' Schoel said. ``Yes it can be, but it's not necessarily,
more dangerous to fly at night.''
   The helicopters were flying at 92 mph air speed and about 250
feet from the ground when they collided, Schoel said. One of three
helicopters flying in formation was hit by a fourth, said William
Harralson, deputy public affairs officer at the fort.
   ``There were three aircraft in formation, if you want to say
ducks in a row, headed east, and another who was flying solo, hit
one of those,'' said Harralson. ``There can be 10 or 12
battalion-sized groups working at Fort Campbell at one time.''
   ``We have been told by the tower that the weather was good,'' he
said.
   The solo helicopter carried four servicemen; the 13 others were
in the other aircraft.
   Adams said the weather was good, which in military terms means
visibility of better than a mile and a cloud ceiling of at least
500 feet.
   One helicopter crashed on the Tennessee side of the border, the
other in Kentucky. Although the soldiers were carrying personal
weapons, such as M-16 rifles, the helicopters were not armed,
Schoel said.
   One of the other Blackhawk helicopters returned to the air
field; the other landed at the crash site.
   ``They witnessed the accident. They were providing statements to
the investigators, and the decision was made not to make them fly
it back,'' Schoel said.
   A team from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., was
called to investigate. A safety expert from Sikorsky Aircraft in
Stratford, Conn., the helicopter's manufacturer, also sent a safety
expert.
   The Army identified three of the dead as Staff Sgt. Charles L.
Shirley, 21, of Arkansas; Sgt. Dennis Sabot, 28, of Iowa; and Spec.
4 Samuel A. Hintz, 23, of Ohio, all from the 2nd Battalion, 502nd
Infantry. Home towns were not provided. Names of the other victims
were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice in May 1987,
once for inspection and once because of a design flaw. The entire
fleet also was grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatal
crashes. In 1985, the Army identified a defect in the main rotor
assembly and ordered it corrected.
   Army Undersecretary James R. Ambrose said in November he had
confidence in the Blackhawk. Noting news reports that radio and
microwave towers on the ground can interfere with the aircraft's
electronic control systems, he said no safety hazard had been found.
   ``The Blackhawk has a safety record at least four times better
than the aircraft it replaced,'' said Bob Stangarone, a spokesman
for Sikorsky, a division of United Technologies.
   Stangarone noted the Army has shown its confidence in the
Blackhawk by awarding Sikorsky multiyear contracts for the
helicopter.
   The Blackhawk is designed primarily as a utility and assault
aircraft and is used in air assault, air cavalry and medical
evacuation, said Maj. Phil Soucy, a spokesman for the Army in
Washington.
   Soucy said there had been no move by safety investigators to
ground the Blackhawk fleet as a result of the accident.
   The helicopter normally is operated with a crew of three and can
carry 11 combat-equipped soldiers.
   Fort Campbell was the home base of 248 soldiers killed Dec. 12,
1985, when a chartered jet bringing them home for Christmas from
peacekeeping duties in the Sinai Peninsula crashed in Gander,
Newfoundland.

<HEAD>Dole Says It's Now ``Up to Illinois'' to Revive His Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs, Bush telegram refusing debates; picks up
10th graf pvs, bgng: Dole contended</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
conceding he must win in Illinois, renewed his call for a series of
one-on-one debates in the state with Vice President George Bush.
But Bush rebuffed the request, saying it was time to look ahead to
the general election.
   ``I respectfully decline your invitation to debate in
Illinois,'' Bush said in a telegram to Dole, reminding his rival
that the two have already been in six GOP debates together. ``I
believe it is now time to look ahead to the issues which
distinguish us from the Democrats.''
   ``Good luck,'' added the vice president, who trounced Dole in
the big round of Super Tuesday contests. Dole was all to mindful of
that as he kicked off his Illinois effort on Wednesday.
   ``I've got to win Illinois,'' he said. ``And if I can do that
then ... I think people will pause to reflect.''
   Dole spoke outside a hospital where he had surgery 40 years ago
for crippling wounds suffered in World War II. He said he came to
visit Wesley Hospital, now part of the Northwestern Memorial
Hospital complex, because ``I walked out of these doors and started
back on the road to recovery.''
   ``After taking a bath yesterday, I've got to start down that
road again,'' Dole said.
   Bush won 16 of 17 Republican contests on Tuesday, while Dole won
none.
   The Kansas senator said ``it would not be easy'' to overtake
Bush but he maintained that he could do it ``the hard way _ one
state at a time.''
   At Northwestern Law School, Dole renewed his call for Bush to
participate in a round of Lincoln-Douglas style debates without
moderators.
   ``I just appeal to George Bush. Here's a chance, George, to
finish me off right here in Illinois,'' Dole said.
   Dole contended that past debates featured too many candidates
and prevented a clear comparison of his record with the vice
president's.
   He also began airing a TV commercial in which he links Bush to
U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   Dole projected a confident, come-from-behind theme and
repeatedly told audiences that he was a ``strong person'' who had
overcome past personal difficulties.
   ``I'm here after a rather difficult day,'' Dole told the law
students. ``I feel like I've just taken the finals, and I didn't
flunk but I didn't do too well either.''
   Dole aides contend that the senator can survive if he wins a
large share of the 82 Republican delegates at stake in the March 15
Illinois primary. But even if he does well in Illinois, he would
face an uphill fight with Bush all the way to the nominating
convention in August.
   Asked if Illinois is a do-or-die contest for Dole, Thomas Rath,
a senior campaign strategist, said: ``If it's not, it'll do until
the real thing comes along. We have to view this campaign in short
bursts, and clearly the next burst for us is Illinois.''
   Assessing the impact of Tuesday's defeats, William Brock, Dole's
campaign chairman, would only say: ``That causes a lot of problems
for us.''
   Rath said the Dole campaign will begin to step up its attacks on
Bush with television ads to start running on Thursday in some
areas, drawing a comparisons between Bush and Dole's records.
Similar ads were used in the Super Tuesday states.
   In addition, Rath said the campaign is considering a new TV spot
to raise the ``electability issue.'' Dole frequently cites polls
that he says show him the strongest GOP nominee against any
Democrat in the general election.
   By focusing on issues, the Dole campaign can ``cut the umbilical
cord'' that links Bush to President Reagan and gives him a
popularity boost among Republicans who favor the administration,
Rath said.
   Dole campaigned in the Chicago area on Wednesday beneath leaden
skies and in a damp chill _ weather that seemed to match the gloomy
aftermath of Super Tuesday for his campaign.
   But in contrast to his defeat in New Hampshire, when Dole
angrily lashed out at Bush, the Kansas senator tried to project an
upbeat image and repeatedly declared that he was ``on the road to
recovery'' in Illinois.
   At a suburban commuter train station, Dole shook hands with a
few people as they hurried off to work.
   One man, who identified himself as a Dole supporter but declined
to give his name, summed up the political landscape for a reporter:
``I guess it's all over for him unless he wins Illinois. That's too
bad.''

<TEXT>
   The World Court on Wednesday
ordered hearings on a United Nations attempt to block the United
States from shutting down the PLO's office in New York.
   Anti-terrorism legislation passed by the U.S. Congress on Dec.
22 calls for the Palestine Liberation Organization U.N. observer
mission to be closed by March 21.
   The United States defied a 143-1 U.N. vote last month that
called for the dispute to be submitted to an independent
arbitration panel.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar last week asked
the court for a ruling on whether the United States has a right to
refuse arbitration, which is called for in the 1947 headquarters
treaty.
   On Wednesday, the 15-member World Court ordered hearings April
11 in the case.
   The court also ordered the United Nations and the United States
to submit written arguments by March 25. Other U.N. members are
also entitled to file arguments, a court statement said.
   The World Court, formally known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary
adherence to its rulings.
   The PLO was granted non-voting observer status at the United
Nations in 1974 and has maintained an office in New York ever since.
   The U.S. State Department and the United Nations say the United
States is obliged by the 1947 headquarters treaty to allow the
observer mission to remain. But Attorney General Edwin Meese III
reportedly said he plans to enforce the measure anyway. He is
expected to announce his decision later this month.

   A jury Wednesday began deliberating whether
a 15-year-old who admitted bludgeoning a classmate with a baseball
bat was a cold-blooded thrill killer or a troubled teen-ager whose
cries for help had been ignored.
   The panel deliberated for four hours Wednesday before recessing
until Thursday morning.
   The prosecution in its closing argument portrayed Rod Matthews
of Canton as a calculating murderer who lured 14-year-old Shaun
Ouillette into the woods in November 1986 just ``to find out what
it was like to kill somebody.''
   ``He did that because he doesn't care about anybody,'' said
Norfolk County District Attorney Peter Casey, who repeatedly jabbed
an accusatory finger at Matthews. ``What did it feel like? It was
deliberate. ... He really wound up and hit him about the head.''
   Defense attorney John Philip White urged the jury to deliver a
verdict of innocent by reason of insanity, characterizing Matthews
as a ``diseased intellect'' unable to act rationally. White also
said attempts by Matthews, 14 at the time of the slaying, to seek
help from teachers prior to the Nov. 20, 1986, slaying were ignored.
   Matthews, whose eyes were downcast during the two hours of
closing arguments Wednesday, the seventh day of the trial, admitted
to clubbing Ouillette, also of Canton. He had told friends he
wanted to kill someone and had chosen Ouillette. After the slaying,
he showed them Ouillette's body.
   ``Had they said, `No, don't kill Shaun Ouillette,' in all
likelihood Shaun Ouillette would not have been harmed,'' said
White, as Matthews' mother, Janice, sobbed quietly and shook
throughout his statement.
   Matthews faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without
parole if convicted of first-degree murder. If found guilty of
second-degree murder, the maximum would be life imprisonment with a
chance of parole. A manslaughter conviction would bring a maximum
prison term of 20 years.
   White said if Matthews is found innocent by reason of insanity,
he will be evaluated by the state Department of Mental Health and
is likely to be hospitalized for at least ``14 to 15 years.''
   Casey said the defense's contention that the drug Ritalin had
affected Matthews adversely was a ``smoke screen.'' Casey noted
testimony from several medical experts that Ritalin does not
permanently alter behavior or trigger violence or hallucinations in
normal doses.
   White depicted Matthews as a highly unstable youth whose use of
Ritalin to control hyperactivity may have triggered his violent
behavior.
   Dr. Bernard Yudowitz of Belmont's McLean Hospital testified
Monday that Ritalin may have made it harder for Matthews to control
his behavior. Matthews first decided to kill someone after viewing
the controversial videotape ``Faces of Death,'' which shows animal
and human executions and tortures, said Yudowitz.
   Matthews said he had plotted the slaying for a month to
experience what killing someone was like, according to testimony
from two classmates who were shown the body by Matthews prior to a
pre-Thanksgiving pep rally.
   Ouillette's body was discovered in December 1986 after one of
the youths sent police an anonymous letter. The youths testified
that Matthews, who is being tried as an adult, selected Ouillette
because he did not feel he would be missed.
   None of the teen-agers who knew of the slaying faces prosecution.
   The trial was attended each day by several dozen residents of
Canton, a middle-class community of 17,000 people about 15 miles
south of Boston.
   ``It's been long and hard but it's been worth it. Anytime you
have to fight for your child it's worth it,'' said Jeanne Quinn,
Ouillette's mother.
   The case has been compared to the trial of Anthony Broussard,
18, sentenced 25 years to life Dec. 3, 1982, in San Jose, Calif.,
for killing his girlfriend the year before. Broussard, who was
tried as an adult, took at least 13 schoolmates to see the victim's
body. The movie ``The River's Edge'' was based on that case.

<HEAD>House Speaker To Democratic Candidates: Tone Down Negative Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said he had
sent telegrams Wednesday congratulating all the Democratic
candidates who won delegates on Super Tuesday and asking them to
eschew negative ads from now on in the campaign.
   ``Candidates with viable ideas and strong ideals do not need to
rely on negative campaigning which only tarnishes and muddles the
processes of democracy,'' Wright said.
   Wright said the use of negative ads had become a ``vogue,''
intensified by the short time between the New Hampshire primaries
and Tuesday's 20-state extravaganza.
   The rush left ``no time to make a sensible ... appeal,'' Wright
said, and led candidates to ``succumb to the wicked blandishments
of those in the advertising fraternity'' who specialize in attack
ads.
   Super Tuesday, Wright said, ``put a great premium on having an
enormous amount of money to spend in little quickie TV spots'' and
denied candidates the chance to be evaluated by voters on the
merits of their ideas.
   He said Rep. Richard Gephardt, who was strongly supported by a
long list of his House Democratic colleagues ``basically ran out of
money'' but had not been eliminated from the race.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., agreed that the
idea of a large regional primary could use at least some
fine-tuning.
   ``It might be better if Super Tuesday were a little smaller and
not quite so soon after New Hampshire,'' Foley said.

<TEXT>
   Gallaudet University faculty on Wednesday
overwhelmingly sided with students calling for the resignations of
the deaf school's board chairwoman and newly named president.
   The selection of Elisabeth Zinser, a hearing woman, as president
of the nation's only school for the deaf kicked off a protest that
has virtually paralyzed the campus since Monday.
   ``This is the Selma of the deaf,'' said Kathy Karcher, a
29-year-old graduate student, comparing the desire by deaf students
to be led by a deaf president to the demands in 1963 by blacks in
Selma, Ala. to participate in elections.
   ``In the 11 years I've been here, I've never seen such support
for an issue,'' said Frank Zieziula, chairman of Gallaudet's
counseling department.
   More than half of the school's 274-member faculty supported
replacing board chairwoman Jane Bassett Spilman and Zinser.
   They also joined the students' call for a deaf majority on the
school's 20-member board of trustees. The board now has four deaf
members.
   The faculty vote came after Spilman introduced Zinser at a press
conference by saying the school's 12-member presidential search
committee had been looking for ``the best qualified candidate, not
necessarily a deaf candidate.''
   ``I do not feel that I made a mistake, and the majority of the
board of trustees do not feel that they made a mistake,'' Spilman
said.
   Zinser, an administrator at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro, does not know sign language, and students have claimed
that her selection is another indication that the trustees do not
understand how important a deaf role model is.
   Spilman said she once tried to learn sign language herself, but
had difficulties practicing it off campus.
   ``I do not have a great deal of interaction with deaf people,''
the trustees' chairwoman said. ``Therefore, I do not know how to
sign.''
   Zinser's decision to stay on surprised students and faculty,
since protests that started after her appointment Sunday night have
stopped most instruction on the the campus.
   ``The only way in which I would step aside is if the board of
trustees asked me to,'' said Zinser, who prevailed over two deaf
finalists.
   ``Zinser has more experience, but this is the point no one is
mentioning: Deaf people just haven't been given the chance,''
Zieziula said. ``How can they be expected to compete, academically
or otherwise, if they don't have the same opportunities?''
   Gallaudet, founded in 1864 by an act of Congress, receives
three-quarters of its $76 million budget in federal funds. Spilman
and Zinser met late Wednesday with Reps. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.,
and David Bonior, D-Mich, who serve on the board of trustees.
   Earlier in the day, the congressman met with Gallaudet alumni,
students, faculty and staff.
   Neither they nor Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, the third member
of Congress on the board, participated in the selection of Zinser
as the new president.
   Gunderson said traditionally the congressional role in the
operation of the university has been inactive.
   ``But that is going to change,'' he said.
   Tom Thieding, Gunderson's press secretary, said the
congressmen's intent was to hear all sides and make a decision
``that is best for the university.''
   Students say they will keep up the protest, despite Zinser's
determination to take her post.
   Peaceful but well-attended protests on Monday forced officials
to cancel classes for the day, and a boycott of classes on Tuesday
and Wednesday left most classrooms virtually empty.

<HEAD>Possible Solution Reported In Math Puzzle From 17th Century</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A professor at West Germany's Max
Planck Institute said Wednesday a Japanese colleague may have
solved a mathematical puzzle that has beguiled scientists and
researchers since the 17th century.
   Professor Don Zagier, an American working as a researcher at the
institute, said in a telephone interview that mathematician Yoichi
Miyaoka may finally have proven Fermat's Last Theorem.
   The theorem was developed by French mathematician and magistrate
Pierre de Fermat, who lived from 1601 to 1665 and was a founder of
modern Number Theory and Probability.
   It states: X to the Nth power, plus Y to the Nth power, equals Z
to the Nth power, where X, Y, and Z are nonzero integers, has no
solutions for N when N is an integer _ or whole number _ greater
than the number two.
   Zagier said Wednesday, ``Many important developments in number
theory have resulted from unsuccessful attempts to prove Fermat's
Last Theorem.''
   He said Miyaoka, who also works at the Max Planck Institute for
Mathematics in Bonn, now may have succeeded.
   Zagier, who is also a professor at the University of Maryland,
said, ``This whole thing is of course in the preliminary stages,
but Miyaoka, who gave a presentation on his solution 10 days ago,
believes he has proven the theory and it is certainly serious and
very exciting.''
   Zagier replied when asked if Miyaoka was available to discuss
his solution that Miyaoka was ``too busy rechecking his work ... he
wants to be sure the manuscript is accurate before it goes out.''
   The American added, ``I've been more or less answering the
telephone for him since word of this leaked out.''
   Zagier said he jotted down notes at Miyaoka's presentation and
sent them to Gerd Faltings at Princeton, mathematicians Barry Mazur
and Christophe Soule in Paris, and other experts.
   ``Of course the notes alone are not sufficient, and Miyaoka has
been preparing and checking his manuscript on the solution for the
past week, and that will also be sent to the experts to check,''
said Zagier.
   Zagier said he hoped results from the experts would come in the
next 10 days, but it could take months.

   A nephew of Omar Torrijos, national hero in
Panama for negotiating the Panama Canal treaties, disclosed
Wednesday he has broken with his country's military-dominated
government, accusing it of plunging Panama into a political crisis.
   Meanwhile, the Panamanian Embassy made public the copy of a
letter by Panama's Ambassador to Mexico, Emilia Arosemena
Vallarino, in which she announced her resignation because she was
``in disagreement with political events'' in her country. She had
served in Mexico for 18 years and was dean of the diplomatic corps
there.
   Santiago Torrijos, about 40 years old, left his post Tuesday as
chief of Panama's consulate in Los Angeles and flew to an
undisclosed location in Washington to join forces loyal to ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Telephone calls to the consulate Wednesday afternoon were not
answered.
   Santiago Torrijos is the son of a brother of Omar Torrijos, the
former head of the Panamanian National Guard, now known as the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   He said in a type-written statement distributed to news
organizations Wednesday night the Defense Forces have not lived up
to a pledge made by Omar Torrijos to establish constitutional
democracy in Panama.
   ``The political, financial, moral and social crisis in Panama
must be rectified,'' he said.
   Diplomatic sources, insisting on anonymity, said Santiago
Torrijos is the first member of the Torrijos family to break ranks
with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the commander of the Defense
Forces who orchestrated Delvalle's ouster two weeks ago.
   They said the defection is considered significant because of the
close identification of the Torrijos family with the Defense Forces.
   Word of the defection came as the Reagan administration prepared
for a high-level inter-agency meeting Thursday at which a series of
economic sanctions against Panama will be considered.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said that it is
almost certain that the United States will withhold a $6.5 million
payment due to Panama on March 15 for canal-related operations.
   Also being considered are measures that will have the effect of
making some Panamanian products less competitive in U.S. markets.
State Department figures show that Panama's U.S. exports totaled
$342 million last year, but Commerce Department statistics list
that category at $388 million.
   Meanwhile, White House chief of staff Howard Baker denied
Wednesday that the United States is planning an invasion of Panama,
saying American troops there are merely holding regularly scheduled
training exercises.
   ``Panama is the site of National Guard training exercises and
has been for years,'' Baker said. ``And as I understand it, the
Rhode Island National Guard is now holding regularly scheduled
exercises in Panama.
   ``And certainly if the United States was going to invade Panama,
it wouldn't be with the Rhode Island National Guard. So it simply
is not so. It has no connection at all,'' Baker said, talking with
reporters at the White House after seeing President Reagan off on a
trip to Indiana.
   Jorge Abadia, Panama's foreign minister, on Tuesday accused the
United States of conducting ``the prelude of an armed invasion'' by
staging military exercises along the Panama Canal.
   As part of his effort to survive mounting protests in Panama
against the new government, Noriega from time to time has invoked
Omar Torrijos' name.
   Omar Torrijos was killed in a plane crash in July 1981. A former
deputy of Noriega, Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, caused a political
stir in Panama last June by alleging that Noriega was responsible
for Torrijos' death by arranging to place a bomb aboard the
aircraft.
   Torrijos, the key figure in Panamanian politics from 1968 until
his death, is a revered figure in Panama for persuading President
Jimmy Carter to agree to a treaty that will revert the Panama Canal
to Panamanian control at the end of 1999.
   Santiago Torrijos is said to be an engineer who headed a
government-owned cement plant in Panama before becoming consul
general in Los Angeles about four years ago.
   Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega on Feb. 25 but was fired
himself hours later by the National Assembly, which is dominated by
Noriega loyalists.
   The Reagan administration has refused to recognize the successor
government, nominally headed by President Manuel Solis Palma, and
instead continues to recognize Delvalle as the constitutional
authority in Panama. Noriega has been indicted by two federal grand
juries on drug smuggling charges.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday upheld an order
requiring NBC to surrender outtakes of an interview with a former
consultant for Lyndon LaRouche who said a top LaRouche aide
discussed killing Henry Kissinger.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which also affirmed a
contempt citation against the network, said videotape of the entire
interview should be given to the judge at the trial of LaRouche,
six aides and five political organizations.
   LaRouche, a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, is charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand
jury investigation into an alleged scheme to finance his 1984
campaign through loan and credit-card fraud.
   Floyd Abrams, an attorney for NBC, said no decision had been
made on whether to appeal. He said the ruling ``does not sufficient
recognize the First Amendment rights of broadcasters.''
   NBC had contended that surrendering outtakes, or portions of the
interview not broadcast, violated a First Amendment right against
judicial intrusion into newsgathering and editorial decisions.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton ruled in December that the
rights of the defendants to access to the interview with Forrest
Lee Fick outweighed NBC's rights.
   ``At stake in the defendants' side of the equation are their
constitutional rights to a fair trial,'' the appeals court wrote in
concurring with Keeton, who planned to review the tape and
determine which portions, if any, were relevant to the case.
   Keeton had issued a similar order requiring CBS to surrender
outtakes of an interview with another LaRouche aide. CBS complied.
   Fick, of Reading, Pa., worked as a LaRouche security consultant
and is expected to be called as a witness at the trial.
   NBC interviewed Fick for 100 minutes and in April 1986 aired a
one-minute portion in which Fick said he and LaRouche aide Paul
Goldstein discussed a plot to assassinate Kissinger, the former
secretary of state.
   Goldstein is a defendant in the case now on trial.
   Defense lawyers argued for access to the entire NBC interview.
They contend Fick was among scores of operatives planted in
LaRouche organizations by the FBI and CIA to gather information and
cripple LaRouche's fund-raising network.
   The contempt citation against NBC carried with it a $500-a-day
fine, which Keeton had stayed pending the appeal.
   LaRouche has attended most of the trial since in began in
December. He was allowed to travel last week to West Germany, where
his wife lives, to have surgery for glaucoma.
   He is accused of ordering fund-raisers to flee the country and
destroy records to stymie the grand jury investigation.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ran
strongly throughout Arkansas to rack up nearly double the number of
votes cast for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the Democratic
presidential primary.
   With all 2,762 precincts reporting, Gore had 184,729 votes or 37
percent; Dukakis had 93,532 votes or 19 percent; Jesse Jackson had
85,047 votes or 17 percent, and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had
59,471 votes or 12 percent.
   In the Republican race, Vice President George Bush had 31,327
votes or 47 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 17,359 votes or 26
percent; former television evangelist Pat Robertson had 12,232
votes or 18 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 3,405 votes or
5 percent.
   Based on those results, Gore would capture 19 Democratic
delegates, Dukakis 10 and Jackson 9. Bush would get 15 GOP
delegates, Dole 7, Robertson 5 and Kemp 1.
   Also on the ballot, U.S. Rep. Bill Alexander crushed the bid of
political consultant Darrell Glascock in the race for the
Democratic nomination for Congress in the 1st District. Alexander
won by a 2-1 margin. There is no Republican nominee.
   Dukakis was the choice of much of the state's Democratic
establishment, but Gore had strong support that ranged from farm
districts to cities throughout the state. Jackson wiped out his
Democratic opposition in areas where blacks were in the majority,
but finished third or worse in most other places.
   Arkansas had a large voter turnout for the primary election;
more than 55,000 people cast ballots, roughly double the state's
norm.

<HEAD>Premier Quits, Calls Election After Losing Confidence Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Howard Pawley of Manitoba,
head of the only socialist government in North America, resigned as
leader of his party and called a provincial election Wednesday
after losing a vote of confidence.
   Pawley, 53, leader of the New Democratic Party, had ruled with a
one-seat majority until the unexpected defeat in a budget vote
Tuesday night.
   When renegade New Democrat Jim Walding sided with the
opposition, the government fell by 28 votes to 27.
   Pawley, elected to a second five-year term in 1986, waited
overnight before meeting with his party and announcing his decision
to call an April 26 election in Manitoba, a large central province
with just over 1 million people.
   An election was expected, in accordance with Canadian
parliamentary tradition following defeat on a budget vote.
   But Pawley stunned colleagues by also announcing his plan to
step down after nine years as leader. A leadership convention will
select a successor who will be thrust immediately into the election
campaign.
   ``This would not have been a time of my choosing,'' said the
premier.
   There was speculation Pawley might switch to federal politics by
running for the New Democrats in the next national election, due
within 18 months.
   Ed Broadbent, national leader of the New Democratic Party, said
in Ottawa Wednesday he would welcome Pawley aboard.
   The upheaval in Winnipeg has other national ramifications.
   Latest polls indicate the Conservative Party in Manitoba is
twice as popular as the New Democrats, with a good chance of
winning the provincial election.
   That would please Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
federal government because Pawley was the most outspoken provincial
opponent of the free-trade agreement Mulroney negotiated last year
with the United States.
   Pawley also has reservations about the Meech Lake constitutional
accord fashioned last year to recognize French-majority Quebec as
``a distinct society'' and to share federal powers with the 10
provinces.
   National opinion surveys put the New Democrats in a dead heat
with the Conservatives and opposition Liberal Party. Pawley could
help Broadbent convert that popularity into seats.
   The New Democratic Party has its origins in the Cooperative
Commonwealth Federation, a socialist political group founded in the
Canadian prairies in the depression 1930s. It introduced
unemployment benefit and socialized medicine to Canada.
   Walding, a former speaker of the Manitoba legislature who felt
overlooked by Pawley, explained his defection by saying he was
under too much strain keeping the government afloat with his one
vote.
   ``It is time for the people of Manitoba to decide whether this
government still has a mandate,'' he said.

   A group that opposes a peace accord
with minority Tamils killed six people from the Sinhalese ethnic
majority, including a government official and two family members,
military officers said Wednesday.
   The officers blamed the outlawed People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese group, for the killings near Beliatta, 85 miles southeast
of Colombo.
   They said the official, P.K. Dissanayake, and two members of his
family were abducted Tuesday night by men wearing police uniforms
and their bodies were found early early Wednesday. Three other
Sinhalese were shot dead Wednesday, the officers said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Authorities blame the Sinhalese group for more than 150 killings
since July 1987 in its campaign against a peace agreement designed
to end a 4-year-old Tamil separatist war that has taken more than
8,000 lives. The Front claims the July 29 agreement grants Tamils
too many concessions.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese, a predominantly Buddhist ethnic group that controls
government and military.

   A former aide to Gov. Evan Mecham
testified Wednesday at Mecham's impeachment trial that an official
accused of threatening her enjoyed special status because of his
fund-raising for Mecham.
   Donna Carlson, Mecham's former special assistant for legislative
affairs, said that when she once complained about Lee Watkins'
position in the governor's inner circle, she was told by Mecham's
then chief of staff: ``We have to take care of Lee. He raised a lot
of money for the campaign.''
   The former chief of staff, Jim Colter, did not immediately
return a telephone message left by The Associated Press.
   Mecham is accused of obstructing the state attorney general's
investigation of the alleged threat by Watkins on Ms. Carlson's
life in November as she was about to testify before a grand jury
investigating Mecham's campaign finances.
   After Ms. Carlson's testimony Wednesdsay and the showing of
videotaped comments by Mecham, the prosecution rested its case on
the obstruction charge, and the Senate voted down, 25-4, a defense
motion to dismiss the count.
   The presiding officer directed the defense to begin presenting
its case.
   The governor also is accused concealing a $350,000 campaign loan
and misusing $80,000 in state money by loaning it to his car
dealership.
   Mecham has not attended the proceedings, but senators Wednesday
were shown a Nov. 16 TV interview in which Mecham denied knowledge
of the alleged death threat.
   Prosecution witnesses have testified that Mecham had been told
of the alleged threat and had directed an aide to investigate
several days before the interview.
   Mecham, a 63-year-old first-term Republican, is the first U.S.
governor to be impeached in six decades.
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict him.
The senators could then take another vote to bar him from holding
state office again.
   Mecham also faces a criminal trial on charges of concealing the
$350,000 loan and a recall election May 17. On Wednesday the trial
was rescheduled, from March 22 to April 21.
   Ms. Carlson, who said she took the reported threat on her life
seriously because Watkins has a criminal record, told the Senate
that neither Mecham nor any of his close aides ever called to
inquire about her safety in light of the threat.
   ``I felt very alone,'' she said.
   She said she believed her only protection then was to go to the
news media with word of the threat and ``let the world know about
it.'' She said she was the source of an Arizona Republic story that
first reported the alleged threat on her life.
   Watkins, who previously denied threatening Ms. Carlson, last
week refused to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. The former chief of prison construction
resigned in January after it was disclosed that he did not report a
1966 assault conviction to the state.
   On Friday, Corrections Director Sam Lewis testified that Watkins
told him in June 1987 the Mecham administration owed Watkins a job
because ``the more that you raise for the campaign, the higher
level job you received in state government.''
   Lewis also testified Watkins told him ``he had enough
(information) that he could bring the entire administration down.''
   Ms. Carlson worked for Mecham's election and became one of his
closest advisers before resigning in a dispute over official
policies and appointments.
   She said her emnity with Watkins dated back to the early days of
Mecham's administration when she warned the governor to ``be very
careful'' of associating himself with Watkins, who had been the
subject of negative newspaper articles.
   However, she said she didn't learn until last September of
Watkins' criminal record. In 1959, he was convicted at age 19 of
the robbery of a post office and served time in a federal youth
offender correctional facility. He was convicted of assault in 1966.
   She said she was upset that the information had come to the
governor's staff so late and complained to Department of Public
Safety Director Ralph Milstead.
   ``He said the information had been sent to the governor in
January or February,'' she testified.
   Ms. Carlson said it was Milstead who informed her of the threat
on her life three days after it allegedly was made in November.

<HEAD>Government To Appeal Judge's Ruling On Confession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department filed a notice
Wednesday that it would appeal a federal judge's decision to
suppress the confession of a former Lebanese Shiite Amal militiaman
accused of leading an airline hijacking.
   The government's move to appeal the ruling by U.S. District
Judge Barrington D. Parker stays the March 22 trial of Fawaz Younis
pending a ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.
   Parker ruled last month that the FBI illegally obtained a
confession from Younis when he was arrested in the Mediterranean
after being lured into an FBI-chartered yacht.
   The judge ruled that prosecutors could not use the confession as
evidence that Younis led four other hijackers who seized a Royal
Jordanian airliner on June 11, 1985 at Beirut International Airport.
   The plane was destroyed a day later after the passengers and
crew were taken off the aircraft.
   Parker criticized the FBI's four-day interrogation of Younis
aboard a Navy munitions ship following his arrest last Sept. 13 in
international waters off Cyprus.
   Younis, whose wrists were broken when two FBI agents slammed him
to the deck of the yacht, suffered throbbing pain and seasickness
that left him in no condition to rationally waive his
constitutional right to remain silent, the judge said.
   Parker said the four-day cruise aboard the Navy ship was
conducted solely for the purpose of obtaining a confession.
   The notice of appeal was filed even though prosecutors have not
received permission from Solicitor General Charles Fried to take
the case to the appellate court. It can be withdrawn if Fried
decides the government has no ground to appeal Parker's decision.
   The notice was filed as a protective measure to preserve the
prosecution's right to appeal, according to government sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Although they want to use the confession, federal prosecutors
have other evidence, including a videotape of Younis reading a
statement to reporters before the plane was blown up in the
background. In addition, two Americans who were aboard the plane
when it was seized by heavily armed hijackers have identified
Younis as being one of their captors.

<HEAD>Physician Says Diplomats' Son Calm Upon Discovering Bodies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of two former South Vietnamese
diplomats, on trial for their murder, was calm and under control
the morning he found his parents dead in their bedroom, the
family's physician testified Wednesday.
   ``He struck me as controlled throughout the entire period,'' Dr.
Philip James told a District of Columbia Superior Court jury
hearing the prosecution's case against Tran Van Khiem.
   Prosecutors presented medical evidence during the trial's second
day to show that Tran Van Chuong, 88, and his wife, Nam Tran
Chuong, 82, were murdered in the bedroom of their Washington home
the morning of July 24, 1986.
   Tran Van Chuong was ambassador to the United States and his wife
was South Vietnam's observer to the United Nations during the
Vietnamese War. The family was part of their nation's ruling
hierarchy in the early 1960s, when one of their daughters, Madame
Nhu, was married to the brother of then-President Ngo Dinh Diem.
   A rift within the family dates back to the war period, when
Madame Nhu became known as the ``Dragon Lady'' because of her
support for Diem's brutal policies.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney G. Paul Howes contends Khiem, 62, killed
his parents in anger after they disinherited him in their wills.
   Medical Examiner Dr. Carol McMahon testified Wednesday that she
determined shortly after examining the bodies that they had been
smothered and ``this was a double homicide.''
   The wife was sprawled across her husband's body in a way that
showed they died in an ``unnatural'' way, McMahon said.
   James, the Chuongs' family doctor for several years, told jurors
Khiem called the physician at his nearby office shortly after Khiem
has said he and a family butler discovered his parents' bodies.
   ``He said, `My parents are very old, my parents are very ill.
They're in a coma,''' James said. ``He seemed calm. There was no
great urgency or hysteria in his voice.''
   The doctor said he came to the house immediately, examined the
wife's body briefly and told Khiem, ``They're gone ... I said, `I
think they've been gone a long time.'''
   Dr. James said he had seen Mrs. Chuong the day before her death
and that she appeared healthy and did not have any of the scratches
and bruises later found on her body.
   The doctor said he immediately called police and that Khiem then
called one of his sisters, Lecchi Oggeri.
   That sister has said in police statements that her mother called
her several times the night before the deaths and told her they
were having an argument over Khiem's inheritance. However, a judge
has not allowed prosecutors to present evidence on what Mrs. Oggeri
said her mother told her.

   Riot police closed a technical school in
the mainly Moslem north Wednesday after students there destroyed a
Christian chapel, newspapers reported.
   Ten pupils were hurt when more than 10,000 students fled the
campus of Kaduna Polytechnic school because of the arrival of the
armed police, the Lagos newspapers reported.
   Christian students demonstrated Wednesday in the streets of
Kaduna, where riot police were out in force. There were several
violent incidents and one injury, the reports said without
elaborating.
   Kaduna is about 375 miles northeast of the Nigerian capital of
Lagos.
   On Tuesday, a group of Moslem students marched on a Christian
chapel under construction at the technical school. The students
smashed the walls, causing the structure to collapse, the newspaper
reports said.
   Christian students had been asking authorities to build the
chapel for more than 10 years. There are five Moslem mosques at the
school.
   Southern Nigeria, where the capital city of Lagos is located, is
primarily Christian.

   Rosa L. Parks, whose refusal to give up her
seat to a white man on a segregated Alabama bus sparked the 1955
Montgomery bus boycott, was in satisfactory condition Wednesday
after receiving a pacemaker.
   Mrs. Parks, 75, of Detroit, entered Johns Hopkins Hospital on
Sunday and the procedure was performed Tuesday, said hospital
spokeswoman Ghita Levine. Mrs. Parks is expected to be discharged
within a couple days, Ms. Levine said.
   Mrs. Parks in Baltimore for medical tests and to help plan a
birthday tribute to her in June, said spokeswoman Ghita Levine.
   Nearly 33 years ago, Mrs. Parks was arrested for refusing to
give up her bus seat. The black community retaliated by boycotting
the buses.
   Buses in Montgomery and other Southern cities ultimately were
desegregated. Her action was heralded as a watershed in the
mounting civil rights movement.

   Bavarian Radio on Wednesday banned a
song that links the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to birth
control to the plight of millions suffering starvation in the world.
   Udo Reiter, director of Bavarian Rundfunk's radio division, said
in a statement the song by popular West German entertainer Udo
Juergens would not be broadcast because its lyrics ``would offend
religious feelings.''
   A station official said station managers concluded that the
lyrics ``simply go too far.''
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The song ``Go Forth and Multiply,'' which plays on a well-known
Bible passage, attacks church prohibitions against using artificial
birth control.
   Referring to problems caused by overpopulation, Juergens wrote:
``The creator will become the destroyer if he continues on this
way.''
   Bild newspaper on Wednesday quoted Juergens as saying, ``I don't
want to offend anyone's religious beliefs, but the 50 million
starving people in the world deserve a forthright voice.''
   Bild quoted a spokesman for Augsburg Bishop Josef Stimpfle as
saying the lyrics contained ``hateful filth.''
   Conservative Bavaria state has a large Roman Catholic population.

<HEAD>Peru Extends Anti-Rebel Emergency Measures in Jungle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peru extended a state of emergency Wednesday
in parts of two states in the eastern jungles, where leftist
guerrillas are reported to be collaborating with drug traffickers.
   The government says that for the past year, Mao-inspired Shining
Path rebels have offered traffickers protection from police in
exchange for money.
   A decree published in the official gazette and signed by
President Alan Garcia prolonged emergency measures for two months
across most of San Martin state and two adjoining counties in
Huanuco state.
   The region lies on the eastern slopes of the Andes, where most
of the coca leaf, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is harvested. The
drug is partially processed and then smuggled into Colombia for
refining.
   A state of emergency suspends constitutional rights to travel
and meet freely. It permits government forces to conduct searches
without warrants and hold suspects for long periods without filing
charges.
   ``Since the acts of violence continue ... it is necessary to
maintain measures aimed at re-establishing public order,'' said the
decree Wednesday.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a smaller leftist
guerrilla band considered less violent than Shining Path, expanded
its urban insurgency to northern San Martin state late last year.
   The government responded by declaring a state of emergency.
   Parts of seven states, home to more than half of Peru's 20
million people, are under states of emergency to fight guerrillas.

   Republican resistance to George Bush's bid for the White House
began crumbling Wednesday as the impact of his fabulous Super
Tuesday showing sank in. Democrats Michael Dukakis, Albert Gore and
Jesse Jackson savored their own successes while aiming for next
week's showdown in Illinois.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Gore of Tennessee agreed the
nomination struggle would last until the convention next summer.
But they quarreled long-distance over which one of them could
attract the most voters to the Democratic banner in a campaign
against the Republicans.
   Bush spent the day in Houston savoring his 16-state primary
sweep and the roughly 600 delegates they brought. The outlook for
Illinois wasn't bad either, as Gov. James Thompson was backing the
vice president and Sen. Bob Dole's own campaign polls gave Bush the
lead.
   Dole, meanwhile, said Rep. Jack Kemp had telephoned him to say
he would drop out of the race Thursday, without endorsing either of
his Republican rivals. Kemp, who has scheduled a morning news
conference in Washington, had been expected to bow out after weak
finishes in all the contests so far.
   ``He (Kemp) wanted me to know he was going to get out
tomorrow...He's not going to endorse anybody...He's going to stay
neutral,'' Dole told reporters in Chicago.
   The vice president, for his part, sounded like he was trying to
nudge Dole from the race. He declined his rival's challenge to
debate him in Illinois in a telegram that said the time had come to
``look ahead to the issues which distinguish us from the
Democrats.''
   ``Good luck,'' he wrote.
   Dole awoke to a campaign in shambles after losing all 17 Super
Tuesday states and conceded, ``I've got to win Illinois'' to save
his candidacy. The Kansas senator visited the hospital in Chicago
where he was treated 40 years ago for his crippling World War II
wounds, while his senior aides met to discuss wholesale staff
reductions.
   Republican Pat Robertson signaled he knew the game was all but
over, although he said he would stay in contention.
   ``None of us could have dreamed that he (Bush) could be so
strong,'' said Robertson. He said the vice president had run a
``fabulous race,'' and added, ``The mantle of Ronald Reagan has
passed to George Bush.'' The former television evangelist said he
would remain in the race, but talked in terms of expanding his
support for a campaign rerun in 1992.
   On the Democratic side, Gary Hart was apparently poised to quit.
He put travel plans on hold and scheduled a news conference on
Friday in Denver. A Denver TV station, KUSA, said he had told his
staff he would abandon his bid for the nomination.
   The former Colorado senator, who has garnered few votes in any
contest since re-entering the race in December, failed to win a
single delegate on Tuesday, and home state Gov. Roy Romer endorsed
Dukakis. Hart had dropped out of the race in May amid reports of
his relationship with a Miami model.
   At the White House, Chief of Staff Howard Baker said Reagan
would remain neutral in the race for a while longer. But then he
added that it would take a ``major event'' to deny Bush the
nomination. ``He's certainly got the momentum,'' said Baker, who
once harbored White House ambitions of his own.
   If anything, the Democratic race looked like it was just
beginning. Delegate leader Dukakis stood only about a quarter of
the way toward the 2,082 convention votes needed to be nominated.
   Jackson was the early favorite to win the South Carolina
caucuses on Saturday, while he and Sen. Paul Simon looked like
favorite son front-runners for next Tuesday's Illinois primary.
   Jackson said he was ``overcome with a sense of history and joy''
after winning primaries in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Virginia and second-place finishes in Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Maryland and elsewhere.
   Gore said Dukakis was the embodiment of ``the same old formula''
that has led Democrats to 49-state defeats in two of the last five
presidential elections, and said he was the man to gain the
allegiance of independent voters. ``This is a battle for the future
of the Democratic Party,'' said Gore, who won his home state of
Tennessee as well as Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina and
Oklahoma and Nevada's caucuses.
   Dukakis, the leader in national convention delegates with 455,
said polls show him running ahead of Bush in Florida and Texas. The
Massachusetts governor said he had won a ``national victory,'' and
pointed to wins in every corner of the country as evidence.
   He won primaries Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Maryland, Rhode
Island and at home in Massachusetts, and was the winner in the
Idaho caucuses and the leader in Hawaii's caucuses.
   ``Al hasn't won a primary outside the South,'' he said of Gore.
   Dukakis said he was the man with the message for the voters in
the industrial state voters yet ahead. ``I'm a chief executive.
I've balanced budgets, I took a state that was in desperate shape
12 years ago and today it's one of the great success stories,'' he
said.
   Simon, who sat out Super Tuesday, waited for his rivals in his
home state. He said he fully expects to win both the popular vote
and the plurality of the state's 187 national convention delegates,
even though he won't be advertising on television. If he fails to
win, he said, he will be reassessing his campaign.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who won only his home state of Missouri
on Tuesday, insisted the ``race is on'' as he attacked Dukakis and
Gore on trade issues during a campaign stop in South Carolina.
   Despite his vow, aides said Geophardt would make a minimal
effort in Illinois and hoped to conserve his resources for a major
battle in the Michigan caucuses on March 26.

<HEAD>Joyce Brown Collects $7,000, Says She Won't Panhandle Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A formerly homeless woman who successfully
fought her forced hospitalization by the city said Wednesday she
went back to the streets to panhandle for money over the weekend
because she was broke.
   ``I'm not insane for having panhandled,'' said Joyce Brown, who
has been living at a halfway house for women since her release from
a psychiatric ward Jan. 19. ``It's not a sign of insanity _ it's a
sign of trying to survive.''
   The 40-year-old Miss Brown, who called herself Billie Boggs on
the street, said she won't panhandle again because she had just
received Social Security checks mailed to her sister's New Jersey
home.
   The checks, totaling $7,000, were turned over to Miss Brown on
Tuesday, said her lawyer, Norman Siegel of the New York Civil
Liberties Union. Miss Brown said she needed $10 over the weekend
for cigarettes and food.
   Miss Brown also acknowledged shouting obscenities at passers-by
outside her hotel Sunday, but only at those who taunted her.
   ``Because I am known as a figure, people were being smart and
sarcastic: `Billie, didn't I see you on TV?' So I did use profanity
to make them leave me alone, and it worked,'' she said, calmly
answering questions.
   Miss Brown, after her release, had worked as a temporary
receptionist at the ACLU's office, and had given several interviews
and made talk show appearances and speaking engagements, including
one at Harvard Law School.
   She lived for months over a hot-air grate on Manhattan's East
Side and was the first homeless person picked up and forcibly
hospitalized when the city began clearing mentally ill people from
the streets Oct. 28.
   She was released after a judge ruled she could not be forced to
take medication.
   Dr. Robert Gould, whom Miss Brown visits weekly for
psychotherapy, said she eventually will return to work but needs
time to adjust to her freedom.
   ``Her celebrity status in the last couple of months is not an
easy thing to handle,'' he said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Wednesday, ``She left the hospital
against the will of the doctors. Had she stayed there, she might
have received medical treatment that might have stabilized her.''

   In the wake of poor Super Tuesday showings,
Pat Robertson declared himself ``in for the long haul,'' but Rep.
Jack Kemp and former Sen. Gary Hart appeared poised to abandon
their presidential hopes.
   Hart, whose reconstituted presidential campaign has attracted
few votes, has scheduled a news conference in Denver on Friday, and
one report said he has told his staff he'll call it quits.
   Sen. Bob Dole, campaigning in Chicago, said Kemp had telephoned
him to say he would drop out of the race Thursday, without
endorsing another Republican. Kemp has scheduled a morning news
conference in Washington on Thursday.
   ``He (Kemp) wanted me to know he was going to get out
tomorrow...He's not going to endorse anybody...He's going to stay
neutral,'' Dole told reporters.
   Democrat Hart, who re-entered the race in December saying ``Let
the people decide'' but who got less than 5 percent of the vote in
all primary states, canceled a Wednesday night speech in Chicago.
   Hart watched the returns Tuesday night with his family in his
home in suburban Denver and made no public comment on the outcome.
The next day he put travel plans on hold, and Denver TV station
KUSA said he told his staff he would be quitting.
   Kemp, a former pro football quarterback, who had portrayed
himself as a consensus conservative who could carry on the Reagan
``revolution,'' was not expected to continue his cash-short
candidacy any further.
   Kemp, who met with advisers on Wednesday, had been reported
ready to pull out of the race this week anyway, even before
Tuesday's results were known.
   But Robertson, who did only slightly better than Kemp in the GOP
primaries, struck a defiant note, vowing to carry his challenge all
the way to the Republican convention this summer in New Orleans.
   ``It isn't over yet,'' Robertson said at a news conference in
Atlanta. ``Still half of the delegates are to be selected.''
   Although the former television evangelist earlier had looked to
the South as his base of support, he dismissed the importance of
Tuesday's primaries, held mostly in Southern and border states.
   ``I was running against the ghost of Ronald Reagan,'' Robertson
said of the 16-state sweep by Vice President George Bush.
   ``I'm in it for the long haul, for this time, for 1990, the
congressional races, and who knows what will happen in 1992,'' said
Robertson.
   Robertson did chalk up one victory on Tuesday, winning the
Washington state caucuses. But in other states, he was far
outdistanced by both front-runner Bush and Sen. Bob Dole.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, who sat out the Super Tuesday
primaries but did poorly in states where his name appeared on the
ballot, called next week's primary in his home state of Illinois
the ``Super Tuesday of the industrial states.''
   ``If I don't do well here, I'll have to reassess my campaign _
but I'll do well,'' Simon said. ``We'll win the beauty contest and
the delegates. We'll win more delegates than anybody else.''
   Simon said he was not going to buy television ads in his home
state.
   ``I offer Illinois 30 years of service rather than a 30-second
commercial,'' Simon said at a morning news conference in Chicago.
   Meanwhile, Democrat Rep. Richard Gephardt and Dole sought to
shrug off their big losses and pressed on with their campaigns.
   ``It's up to Illinois now to turn it around,'' Dole, the Senate
Republican leader, told voters in a Chicago suburb after he was
shut out in all 17 Tuesday GOP primaries and caucuses.
   And Gephardt, who like Dole picked up only a handful of
delegates and won only in his home state of Missouri, campaigned
Wednesday in South Carolina, where Democratic caucuses are to be
held on Saturday.
   His campaign also was to focus on the March 26 voting in
Michigan, after all but conceding Illinois to the two home state
candidates, Simon and Jesse Jackson, whose home is in Chicago.

   Officials blamed gang members and
non-students Wednesday for violence at high school basketball games
in New Jersey, where a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot after one
contest and another match was played in secret to avoid threatened
trouble.
   ``Parents shouldn't have to worry about their kids being beaten
up or stabbed or shot at a basketball game,'' said Richard
Luttrell, former past president of the state athletic directors
association.
   On Tuesday, a former student at Paterson's Kennedy High School
was fatally shot following a regional championship contest at
Hackensack High School between Kennedy and Passaic County Technical
and Vocational High School of Wayne.
   A 19-year-old Hackensack man was charged with the slaying,
police said.
   The shooting followed a disagreement in the school parking lot
between boys from Paterson and Hackensack over a girl, said
Hackensack Police Lt. Anthony Leggieri.
   Richard Lindsey of Paterson, who was stranded with three other
youths after the game without a ride back to Paterson, was killed
by one shot in the face from a .25-caliber gun as he walked along
the street five blocks from the school, Leggieri said.
   The suspect, Troy Frazier, an unemployed dropout of Hackensack
High School, was charged with homicide and jailed on $250,000 bail,
McClure said.
   Also on Tuesday, the threat of gang violence forced officials to
move a game between longtime rivals Atlantic City High School and
Camden High School to a location 30 miles away.
   Luttrell, who also is athletic director for Willingboro schools,
said authorities moved the game from Willingboro High School after
receiving word that non-students from Atlantic City and Camden
planned a fight with automatic weapons over a shooting several
months ago.
   The game was played under police guard at Overbrook High School.
Coaches learned of the location only as they boarded team buses and
were handed envelopes with directions to the school.
   On Dec. 27, a woman was shot and four men were slashed or
stabbed during a fight in the crowd at a tournament in Absecon,
disrupting a game and forcing cancellation of the last two days of
the tournament.
   Holy Spirit High School refused to play host to the tournament
again. Next year it moves to St. Joseph's University in
Philadelphia.
   A month later, a game between Atlantic City and Egg Harbor
Township High School was postponed when a freshman on the Atlantic
City team was arrested for having a weapon in his locker.
   In Willingboro, teen-age girls from rival gangs started a fight
following a game earlier this season between Willingboro High and
crosstown rival John F. Kennedy High School, Lutrell said.
   The fight could have been worse had school authorities not used
metal detectors to scan the crowd, Luttrell said.
   Such security precautions have helped reduce troubles at
Willingboro schools, Luttrell said.
   Tensions could be further reduced by keeping non-students away
from the matches, he said.
   ``Let's have the games be good wholesome fun by limiting the
spectators to the student body and their immediate family. The
hangers-on, the dropouts, the gang members, they don't get in,''
Luttrell said.
   Kennedy High Principal William Toole said details of the
Tuesday's fatal melee remained unclear. The victim was a dropout,
he said.
   There were no incidents during the game, which 2,000 spectators
attended, said Hackensack High principal Harold Bloom.
   But Bloom said he planned to re-evaluate whether more
championship games would be played this season at Hackensack High
School.
   Robert Kanaby, the director of the New Jersey State
Interscholastic Athletic Association, was out of town and
unavailable for comment Wednesday. The association oversees boys
and girls high school sports in the state.

   Thirteen Soviets and Canadians trying to ski
across the Arctic were suffering from frostbitten faces, numb
fingers and toes and broken skis, but an organizer said Wednesday
they were making good progress.
   ``There's no dire emergency,'' said Tom Atkins, the
Toronto-based communications director for the four Canadians on the
team, which set off March 3 from Cape Arctic at the northern tip of
the Siberian archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya.
   Atkins said the group had covered 56 miles of the 1,200-mile
journey from Siberia to northern Canada and that the temperature
Wednesday was 53 degrees below zero, with winds of 15 mph.
   ``They say there's frostbite scarring most faces, and toes and
fingers are permanently numb and painful even when they're warm,''
Atkins said.
   He said the Rev. Laurie Dexter, an Anglican priest from Fort
Smith in Canada's Northwest Territories, had blistered feet and was
taking medication.
   ``But they're very pleased with the distances they've been
making, except for one day when they had to go around open water,''
Atkins said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Wednesday night in
Moscow that the expedition led by Soviet mathematician Dmitri
Shparo traveled only seven kilometers (slightly more than four
miles) Saturday, when it came across a wide stretch of open water
and decided to wait until the next day to ski around it.
   Tass said Dexter had to give up carrying his pack for a few days
after running into a foot problem from his new Soviet ski boots. It
said the contents of the pack, which weighed more than 88 pounds
when the team left, was distributed among the other skiers.
   The team hopes to reach Cape Columbia on the northern tip of
Canada's Ellesmere Island within three months.
   Atkins said the condensation and cold made it impossible to dry
sweat-drenched clothes at night in tents: ``They freeze as soon as
you take them off.''
   Two of the Canadians tried sleeping outside in an igloo Tuesday
night to avoid the condensation problem.
   Three of the nine Soviets have broken their skis and
replacements will be dropped to them from planes.
   The skiers received good-luck telegrams from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
Atkins said.
   The Soviets first proposed the expedition as a good-will gesture
for peace and to show that it was possible to ski across the
Arctic. The Soviet state sports committee, Moscow Trade Union
Council and Soviet youth newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, are
sponsoring the Soviet team, while corporate sponsors have backed
the Canadian effort.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of Spain's 270,000 public school
teachers stayed out of the classroom Wednesday in the first of two
days of strikes to demand pay increases.
   The strike disrupted classes for more than 6 million students in
elementary, secondary and technical schools in most parts of the
country, union and Education Ministry officials said.
   Spain's two largest unions, the Socialist-led General Workers
Union and the Communist-oriented Workers Commissions, and three
smaller teachers' unions called the strike.
   Workers Commissions spokesman Javier Doz told Spanish Television
the teachers wanted the Socialist government to end ``pay
discrimination'' against teachers.
   He said grade school teachers earn an average $930 a month and
want $1,170 while secondary and technical school teachers seek to
increase their average monthly pay of $1,080 to $1,380.
   Education Ministry official Joaquin Arango told reporters the
teachers' demands were ``economically unfeasible'' due to budget
constraints.

<TEXT>
   The chief of the government's human
rights watchdog agency said Thursday allegations of widespread
abuse raised by Amnesty International were exaggerated.
   Mary Concepcion Bautista, chairman of the government's Human
Rights Commission, made the statement after two human rights groups
criticized the government of President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday
for allegedly using torture and terror to stem a 19-year-old
insurgency by communist rebels.
   Meanwhile, a former defense minister said the guerrillas were
making major gains while the military has become increasingly
plagued by infighting and lack of equipment.
   The activist Task Force-Detainees, a private group supported by
the Roman Catholic Church, said that its investigation showed that
7,444 Filipino civilians were arrested illegally in 1987, eclipsing
the 5,967 arrests in 1985, when Ferdinand Marcos was president.
   Spokesman Noel Salazar said his group's investigations showed
that 602 of those people arrested illegally were tortured.
   Aquino rose to power when Marcos' authoritarian regime collapsed
in Feburary 1986.
   The Task Force-Detainees allegations followed a critical report
released Wednesday in London by Amnesty International.
   The human rights organization called on Aquino's government to
end killings by military and paramilitary forces, saying they
represented the country's most serious human rights problem since
mid-1987.
   ``It is exaggerated,'' Mrs. Bautista said of the Amnesty report.
``It's a very one-sided story.''
   She said the government was investigating about 200 cases of
human rights abuses and that civil suits were pending in the courts
against offenders.
   ``We have ongoing investigations,'' she added. ``They're not all
saints in the military ... but there is a serious effort to clean
up.''
   Mrs. Bautista said investigations of human rights abuses against
the military were often not publicized to avoid demoralizing
soldiers fighting the rebels.
   Amnesty praised the Aquino government for ``some very real
progress'' in human rights, particularly in restoring legal
safeguards and in greatly reducing the use of torture. But it
called on the government to reaffirm publicly its commitment to
protect human rights.
   In Manila, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile told the American Chamber of
Commerce that divisions in the 160,000-strong armed forces and a
lack of supplies were hindering the effort against the communist
rebels.
   ``The situation has become much more delicate than it was
before, not only because of the qualitative improvement of the
capabilities of the insurgents but also because of the
fragmentation in the military organization and the lack of
logistics needed to deal with this problem,'' he said.
   Enrile, a former defense minister, said the communist army has
between 25,000 and 30,000 fighters and controls more territory than
at any time during the rebellion.
   Police captured reputed guerrilla leader Nemesio Demafiles at a
private home in Bacolod, about 300 miles south of Manila, Brig.
Gen. Domingo Rio said.
   Rio said police seized three other rebels in the Wednesday raid
and found a .45-caliber pistol and a map of a nearby Philippine
Constabulary headquarters. Rio alleged that Demafiles apparently
was planning to attack the constabulary.
   Demafiles was believed to be a member of the outlawed Communist
Party of the Philippines' central committee and commander of the
party's military wing on Negros Island, said Col. Oscar Florendo,
chief military spokesman.
   The military had offered a $5,000 reward for his capture.
   Rebel sources in Manila said Demafiles was removed last year as
Negros commander and expelled from the party over an ideological
dispute. They said he had been trying to organize a separate
Marxist group.
   Elsewhere, the military said troops killed the head of a rebel
propaganda unit and captured four other guerrillas Tuesday in
Luzon's Nueva Ecija province.

<HEAD>Pickets Up in New York; Talks To Resume Thursday on West Coast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Striking film and TV scriptwriters were
active on both coasts Wednesday, picketing outside the MGM building
in New York and preparing to resume negotiations here under the
guidance of a federal mediator.
   Script shortages because of the strike begun Monday have forced
CBS to shelve indefinitely two programs set to debut this month,
``The Dictator'' starring Christopher Lloyd, and ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour.''
   The walkout by 9,000 members of the Writers Guild of America
also has forced ``Late Night With David Letterman'' and ``The
Tonight Show'' into reruns.
   Writers have refused to continue working on the script for the
Academy Awards ceremony, scheduled for worldwide broadcast April 11
on ABC. Soap operas have stockpiled scripts for several weeks and
have not been affected.
   Negotiators for the guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers were scheduled to meet Thursday at the
producers' headquarters in Sherman Oaks.
   ``It's a mediation session and that's all I can say,'' WGA
spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said. ``It's important that those topics
on the table be kept there rather than be aired in the media.''
   The strike began after the scriptwriters rejected a final offer
from the producers. Main points of contention were writers' demands
for higher fees from reruns and greater creative control.
   About 100 scriptwriters Wednesday marched outside the MGM
building. Three writers of Letterman's show, wearing jackets with
the program name on the back, walked the picket line with about 125
other strikers and supporters.
   William Peter Blatty, who wrote ``The Exorcist,'' was on the
line, as was Screen Actors Guild member Barbara Feldon of ``Get
Smart'' fame.
   Carson's show will be in reruns the remainder of the week, but
his production company applied for a waiver that would allow the
talk show's writers to resume work next week, spokesman Jim Mahoney
said Wednesday.
   The guild was expected to consider the request this weekend. A
similar waiver was granted in 1981
   The WGA strike is the fourth since 1973. The longest, in 1981,
lasted three months.

   The Parliament extended emergency rule
Wednesday in nine provinces where the government has been fighting
Kurdish guerrillas, including Istanbul, the country's largest city.
   Under emergency rule, civilian governors can impose curfews,
issue search warrants, halt strikes and ban meetings and rallies.
   Wednesday's vote extends the emergency rule for four months.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli told Parliament that Kurdish
guerrillas in eight southeastern provinces killed 100 civilians and
30 soldiers over the past six months. He said 53 people believed to
be terrorists were killed during the same period and 1,761 others
were arrested.
   In the same period in Istanbul, two terrorists were shot dead
and 168 terrorist suspects were arrested, he said.
   The Kurdish Labor Party seeks to set up an independent Marxist
state in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey. It has been
fighting the government since August 1984.
   About one-fifth of Turkey's 52 million population are ethnic
Kurds.
   Also on Wednesday, a parliamentary commission approved a draft
bill that would allow individuals to apply for a court order to
halt or prevent publication of a story deemed an invasion of
privacy.
   Columnist Oktay Eksi wrote in the liberal daily Hurriyet that
the bill, introduced by members of the governing Motherland Party,
meant plain censorship.
   The government disclosed that it has drafted legislation which
would penalize the press for reporting false news, permitting fines
up to $100,000.

<HEAD>Queen Mother Expresses `Much Distress' In Closure Of Hospital Ward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Mother Elizabeth made a foray Wednesday into
the hottest issue in British domestic politics _ the ailing,
tax-funded National Health Service.
   Her office said that in a letter to Health Minister Tony Newton,
the 87-year-old mother of Queen Elizabeth II expressed ``much
distress'' at the closure last December of a ward for the elderly
in a south Wales hospital.
   She had presided at the reopening of the hospital eight months
earlier after its renovation.
   ``Although I am sure you appreciate the queen mother has no
jurisdiction whatsoever over the affairs of the National Health
Service, I have at Her Majesty's command written,'' the letter said.
   George Boulton, the general manager of the Mid-Glamorgan Health
Authority, told reporters the royal intervention was unlikely to
reopen the six-bed ward at St. Tydfil's Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.
   ``No one takes interest from the royal family lightly,'' he said.
   ``But we are facing a deficit of about 4 million pounds ($7.3
million) this year because we haven't got enough money from the
government and prices are going up all the time. We made cuts to
save 1.2 million pounds ($2.2 million).''
   Boulton said closing the ward would save about $73,000. He said
more wards at the hospital may be closed.
   National opinion polls report that the state of the health
service is the biggest worry among Britons.
   Nurses are quitting in protest over their pay and conditions,
wards are closing and the more than 700,000 patients wait months
and sometimes years for operations.
   The service now costs $39.3 billion a year and critics say it
urgently needs another $3.6 billion to $9.2 billion.
   The royal family traditionally stays out of politics, although
Prince Charles, heir to the throne, has expressed anger at
inner-city poverty.
   Robin Cook, social services spokesman for the opposition Labor
Party, which has repeatedly condemned the government for not
spending more on the National Health Service, said: ``This is a
dramatic intervention by the queen mother which demonstrates the
state of the National Health Service.''
   Tony Wilkins, an official of the National Union of Public
Employees in Merthyr Tydfil, said: ``Perhaps the queen mother
should be allowed to open every hospital _ it might be a good way
of protecting our health service.''

   Enough snow fell while Continental Flight
1713 awaited takeoff at Denver's airport Nov. 15 for ice buildup on
the wings to have been a possible factor in the crash, an airplane
engineer testified Wednesday.
   Ralph Brumby, manager of aerodynamics and acoustics for
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which manufactured the DC-9, said 0.032
inches of precipitation, or about a third of an inch of snow, fell
in the 24 minutes between de-icing and takeoff.
   If all that precipitation had frozen on the wing, it could have
caused problems on takeoff, Brumby said. Ice can change the shape
of the wing, affecting lift.
   Continental responded that the plane was going too fast at the
time of the crash for ice on the wings to have affected it.
   Testimony about possible icing and its effects, and detail on
the efforts to rescue the passengers trapped in the plane after it
crashed, dominated the second day of a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing on the crash.
   Twenty-eight people were killed and 54 hurt when the DC-9
flipped over and broke apart on the runway at Stapleton
International Airport shortly after takeoff during a snowstorm.
   Brumby, under questioning by Continental officials, said that
the amount of precipitation that fell between the time the plane
was de-iced and takeoff was high enough that the plane could have
stalled at about 150 knots, or a little more than 170 mph.
   But Continental officials noted that an NTSB study concluded the
craft had reached 168 knots, or about 193 mph, at some point before
it crashed. Airline spokesman Bruce Hicks said that based on those
findings, ice on the wings could not have caused the crash.
   Continental officials also quizzed Brumby about the possibility
the de-icing fluid failed to keep ice off the wings. He said that
was a possibility but did not elaborate.
   He said there have been three DC-9 crashes in which ice was a
factor during the past 23 years, but in all cases there was no
de-icing before takeoff.
   NTSB investigator Robert Benzon had said Tuesday that officials
want to know why 24 minutes elapsed between de-icing and takeoff
when other planes on the runway took off within 15 minutes.
   Earlier Wednesday, officials testified that rescuers had to cope
with frigid weather, confusion and occasional equipment
malfunctions, but the operation went as well as could be expected.
Some victims were trapped in the wreckage for hours.
   ``We feel fortunate we had that many survivors,'' Dr. Michael
Brunko, the rescue coordinator, testified. ``Obviously, there were
people trapped in the wreckage who we could not do anything for.'
   Brunko said that ``to this day, I do not know what else could
have been done.''
   There were problems with pens that would not write, radio
batteries that failed, confusion created by the number of
Continental personnel at the scene, and the effects of the cold on
rescuers who were not dressed for it, according to Brunko.
   Eldon W. Buller, Denver assistant fire chief, said the
upside-down position of the plane delayed the rescue.
   ``Every time we moved the aircraft on one side, we compromised
people on the other side,'' Buller said. ``People were starting to
get crushed.''
   He said firefighters wanted to drain fuel from one of the
aircraft's wings, but they did not know how and no other airport
officials could explain the procedure.
   ``I was afraid it would drown the people trapped underneath'' if
the fuel began leaking, Buller said.

   If Uncle Remus and six of the seven
dwarfs applied for jobs at the Disneyland Hotel, they would be
turned down because of a new dress code. Not even Walt Disney's
pencil-thin mustache would pass muster.
   Disneyland acquired the hotel in January and expanded its
31-year-old dress code to cover its 1,600 employees.
   Under the code, men will have to get haircuts, shave and cover
tattoos. Women will have to abandon slacks, heavy makeup, gaudy
jewelry and wild hairdos.
   Six of the seven dwarfs, Uncle Remus, Captain Hook and
``Pinocchio'' toymaker Geppetto all would be renegades working in
the real-life world of Disney.
   When Disney Co. assumed control of the hotel, previously managed
by the Wrather Corp., its employees fell under the dress code
established for the Magic Kingdom in 1957.
   Some hotel employees said they won't shave, including engineer
Mike Searles, 40, who wears a handlebar mustache.
   ``I don't think it's right, and I'm not going to compromise,''
he said.
   He and others said they will go to their union to fight the
dress code. But workers who rebel may be terminated, said
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth.
   ``The reason that we are doing this is because the Disneyland
Hotel is becoming part of Disneyland Attractions, and we have an
appearance standard,'' Roth said. ``It is associated with Disney
and is expected by our guests.''

   A white supremacist changed his mind
Wednesday about pleading guilty to conspiring to overthrow the
government.
   Bruce Pierce, 34, had said Tuesday that he wanted to plead
guilty after U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold ruled that a
confession given to FBI agents after his 1985 arrest was made
voluntarily and is admissible at trial.
   The judge recommended that Pierce wait and discuss the matter
with his attorney.
   In a statement Wednesday, Pierce said he considered entering the
plea ``to avoid further embarrassment over having given a statement
to the authorities. Upon further review and consideration I have
reconsidered.''
   Pierce is among 10 of the 14 men on trial charged with sedition.
Five are accused of conspiring to kill a federal judge and an FBI
agent, and two are accused of interstate transportation of stolen
money.
   Pierce is serving 100 years for racketeering and 150 years for
civil rights violations in the slaying in Denver of Alan Berg, a
Jewish radio talk show.
   Pierce had contended that the confession was not voluntary. He
said that he was told that if he did not talk to the FBI, his wife
would be arrested and his three children would be placed in foster
homes.

   Police said a bombing attack
injured seven officers as Roman Catholic youths rioted in Belfast
Wednesday for a third straight night over the killing of three
unarmed IRA guerrillas in Gibraltar.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters said the officers
suffered slight injuries when bombs exploded at the rear of
Springfield Road police station in Catholic West Belfast.
   Earlier, police said a grenade was thrown at an army patrol but
exploded harmlessly and that shots were fired at the New Barnsley
police station, which was attacked with gasoline bombs on Tuesday.
   Youths threw gasoline bombs and set vehicles ablaze but no
casualties were reported in those incidents.
   A police official said earlier Wednesday that security forces
will not tolerate Irish Republican Army shows of strength at the
funerals of three guerrillas, who were shot to death by British
commandos last Sunday.
   If there is such a show and ``we move in, we know there is going
to be an unseemly fracas but we simply can't allow the law to be
blatantly defied,'' said a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer. He
spoke anonymously, in accordance with custom.
   Paddy McGrory, lawyer for the three families, arrived in the
British colony on Spain's southern coast to arrange for the return
of the bodies. The funeral date has not yet been set.
   British officials said the IRA members, two men and a woman, had
planned to set off a car bomb Tuesday at a military ceremony in the
center of Gibraltar.
   Spanish police found a car loaded with explosives Tuesday in
Marbella, about 45 miles up the coast from Gibraltar. British
officials believe it was rented by the three slain IRA members.
   The guerrillas killed were Mairead Farrell, 31; Daniel McCann,
30, and Sean Savage, 24, all of west Belfast. The IRA said all were
on ``active service'' at the time of their deaths.
   Police in Madrid said a woman identified as Mary Parkin was
detected in the Gibraltar area in February and was being sought as
a possible fourth member of the IRA team.
   Felix Pizzarello, the Gibraltar coroner, said an inquest will
not be held until May.
   The coroner, who also is a lower-court magistrate, said in a
telephone interview his court ``is fully booked until May and I
can't realisticaly think of having an inquest until then. I don't
consider that the matter requires any urgent treatment.''
   He said Gibraltar police were investigating the shooting and his
inquest would be partly based on documents they would provide
``within two to three weeks.''
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA has been fighting since 1969 to
unite the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic with British-ruled
Northern Ireland, where Protestants form a majority.

   A federal grand jury Wednesday indicted a top
Haitian army official who witnesses say allowed drug traffickers to
use his private landing strip for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments.
   The indictment of Col. Jean-Claude Paul on narcotics counts was
immediately ordered sealed by U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff,
sources close to the case told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity. The charges were expected to be made public Thursday.
   Paul heads the feared 700-man Dessalines Battalion in
Port-au-Prince, which ruthlessly suppressed anti-government
demonstrations last year and was accused of protecting the gunmen
who disrupted November presidential elections, killing 34 people.
   Paul was considered close to the government council that ruled
Haiti until a military-supported civilian president took office
last month.
   Also indicted Wednesday, sources said, were Paul's brother,
Antonio Paul, and the colonel's ex-wife, Merielle Delinois, who is
already a fugitive on previous federal drug charges here.
   The investigation of Jean-Claude Paul has been widely reported
for weeks, and the Haitian army has already denied the officer's
involvement. The Haitian government and Paul had no comment
Wednesday.
   All interviews with army officials must be cleared through Gen.
Carl Nicolas, the army chief of staff. Nicolas has refused a
written request from The Associated Press to speak with Paul.
   Asked during a recent interview at his home about reports of
drug smuggling by the army, President Leslie Manigat said: ``I
can't base my judgment on rumors.''
   Haitian Gen. Carl Nicolas last month denounced reports of ``the
so-called involvement of (Col. Paul) in drug trafficking,'' and
called it part of a ``campaign of denigration'' against the
military by the foreign press.
   One witness in the investigation that led to the indictment was
businessman Osvaldo Quintana, 35, of Miami who told a news
conference last month that Paul helped him smuggle cocaine into the
United States in December 1986.
   ``We flew (the shipment) out of his own personal ranch in
Haiti,'' about 90 miles outside of Port-au-Prince, Quintana said.
   Quintana has testified for the government at previous drug
trials. In January, outside of a federal courtroom, he told
reporters he had once seen 9,000 kilograms of cocaine stuffed into
duffel bags in the Haitian presidential palace during the
administration of ousted leader Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   Quintana has said Haitian military officials routinely aided
drug flights from Colombia, allowing them to land and be serviced
before proceeding on to the Bahamas to drop their loads.
   The witness said he was originally approached by Ms. Delinois to
take part in the smuggling scheme.
   Ms. Delinois was arrested in Miami on drug charges in March
1987, but later skipped bond and is believed to be hiding in Haiti,
according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   DEA affidavits filed in the Delinois case say Quintana met with
Paul and his brother Antonio at the ranch, and watched a plane
carrying 220 pounds of cocaine take off.
   Paul had close ties to the military-dominated junta that
replaced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier after he fled into exile in
France in February 1986.
   Paul seldom appeared in public during the junta's two-year rule,
which ended when Manigat was inaugurated Feb. 7. When he did, it
often was to serve as bodyguard for two junta members, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, the junta president and now military chief, and Brig.
Gen. Williams Regala, now defense minister.

   The government said Wednesday that
banks can reopen but people still will not be allowed to cash
checks or withdraw money. The banks closed last week because of a
cash shortage and political turmoil.
   The National Banking Commission said banks could accept deposits
from clients, conduct interbank operations and transfer money from
one account to another.
   It did not say when withdrawals and check-cashing would be
permitted. Panama's national currency is the U.S. dollar and the
cash supply has been drying up because of the dispute over who
should control the government.
   No banks in the downtown financial district opened for business
immediately.
   Depositors began a run on domestic banks when President Eric
Arturo Delvalle was ousted Feb. 26 after trying to dismiss Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the real power in Panama, as head of the
15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces.
   On Wednesday, the nephew of the late Omar Torrijos, Panama's
previous strongman, disclosed he broke with the Noriega government.
He said he left his post as chief of Panama's consulate in Los
Angeles and was joining forces loyal to Delvalle.
   Diplomatic sources in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the defection of Santiago Torrijos was considered
significant because of the close identification of the his
relatives with the Defense Forces. Omar Torrijos is still
considered a national hero for negotiating the Panama Canal
treaties with the United States.
   The 12 domestic banks closed March 2 in sympathy with a
nationwide general strike called by Noriega's opponents. Late last
week, the government ordered them to remain shut and also closed
more than 100 international banks.
   Commerce has been crippled. With no way to process non-cash
transactions, most businesses refuse to accept checks or credit
cards.
   Panama keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit in American
banks and usually receives remittances, but U.S. judges froze
Panamanian assets in banks in Miami and New York after suits were
filed to prevent Noriega's government from withdrawing funds.
   U.S. Customs Service agents in Miami detained a Boeing 707
chartered by Air Panama for four hours Wednesday to search for U.S.
currency, but no money turned up, customs spokesman Michael Sheehan
said.
   Fifteen agents and inspectors searched cargo unloaded from the
plane after a tip someone might be trying to illegally take U.S.
currency out of the country.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle as Panama's legitimate
president. It has demanded Noriega's removal since he was indicted
in Florida last month on narcotics and money-laundering charges.
   Delvalle went into hiding in Panama after Noriega had the
national legislature dismiss him.
   Because of the cash crunch, Panamanian families have put off
non-essentials.
   Rufina Escobar, a 55-year-old schoolteacher, said she had oil,
noodles and a few eggs _ enough food to make it through the week _
``but if banks don't open next week I'll have to ask friends for a
few dollars just to eat.''
   Panama City was calm Wednesday, unlike a day earlier, when
hundreds of burning trash barricades blocked the streets. The
demonstrations were the largest since Delvalle was dismissed.
   An editorial in the government-run newspaper Critica on Tuesday
said ``all buildings, all institutions in which Americans have any
interest'' should be blown up.
   Its 3-inch-high banner headline said ``Invasion of Panama.'' On
Tuesday, Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia claimed that maneuvers being
conducted by the U.S. Southern Command are ``the prelude to an
armed invasion of Panama.''
   The command, which is based in Panama and is responsible for
U.S. military operations in Latin America, said the maneuvers
involved fewer than 700 soldiers and were ``routine training and
evaluation exercises.''
   The U.S. Embassy issued a communique Wednesday calling Abadia's
allegations ``completely false and tendentious.''
   It also dismissed as ``absurd'' allegations that U.S. Ambassador
Arthur Davis was manipulating funds of the Panama Canal Commission.
   ``The government of the United States has reiterated on various
occasions its faithful compliance with the Panama Canal Treaties,''
the communique said.
   Baltazar Renan Alzpurua, columnist for Critica, said of the U.S.
maneuvers: ``It is time to ... dedicate ourselves to the
organization of volunteers who are ready to fight in the cities,
the mountains, the streets and fields, rifle and machete in hand.''
   Real estate salesman Alexis Alvarez said with a shrug: ``Let the
gringos invade. We can't be any worse off with them than we are now
with this bunch of thieves.''

   Customs agents detained a plane chartered by Air
Panama to search for any U.S. currency being taken illegally out of
the country Wednesday but found none and sent the aircraft on its
way, a spokesman said.
   ``U.S. Customs had some information that there might possibly be
an outbound currency violation connected with the flight,''
spokesman Michael Sheehan said.
   The chartered Boeing 707 was scheduled to carry military and
police-type uniforms, small machinery and other merchandise to
Panama City, Sheehan said. It was detained for four hours
   Panama's national currency is the U.S. dollar, and the cash
supply has been drying up because of a dispute over control of the
Panamanian government.
   Panama keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit in American
banks, but U.S. judges froze assets in banks in Miami and New York
to prevent the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from

   Organizers called off a
strike aimed at protesting the high cost of living Wednesday after
a first day of protest shaped up as a failure.
   Most businesses, banks and government offices kept their doors
open on Wednesday, the first day of the planned 2-day walkout, and
activity in the city was normal.
   Virtudes Alvarez, a spokesman for strike organizers, said the
decision was made Wednesday night to give ``the government a short
time'' to talk with the ``those involved in this movement.'' He did
not elaborate.
   Alvarez represents the National Conference of Popular
Organizations, a coalition claiming to have the support of about
200 urban neighborhood and small peasant groups.
   No incidents of violence were reported Wednesday.
   Six people died and about 20 were injured in other protests in
the last two weeks in the Caribbean nation.
   Soldiers in armored personnel carriers and police with automatic
weapons patrolled the streets of the capital of 1.5 million on
Wednesday.
   Bus and taxi drivers stayed home in the early morning and
thousands of people were late for work, but by midmorning most
drivers were back on the job.
   Public and private schools stayed closed as a precaution in the
event of incidents, school authorities said.
   Most labor and church groups and political parties opposed the
strike. However, the nation's largest union, the General Workers
Union with an estimated 40,000 members, had said it would support
the action.
   The coalition has led strikes since February that shut down
several low-income communities in the capital and resulted in
sporadic clashes between residents and police and soldiers.
   Strike organizers demand that the government control the
spiraling cost of basic commodities, improve public services and
carry out capital improvements in their communities.
   About 4,000 supporters of the governing Reformist Party marched
to the National Palace on Tuesday shouting slogans backing
President Joaquin Balaguer and denouncing the strike.
   Tuesday night, the archbishop of Santo Domingo, Nicolas de Jesus
Lopez Rodriguez, termed the strike ``senseless'' and called for
dialogue among government, business and labor.
   Private economists estimated the inflation rate in the Dominican
Republic at 30 percent last year and said it may reach 50 to 60
percent this year.
   The U.S. dollar, to which much of the Dominican economy is
pegged, meanwhile has been rising steadily with respect to the
peso. The peso now is valued at around 19 cents, compared to 26
cents late last year.
   Balaguer this week announced price controls on items such as
plantains, onions, potatoes, rice, but strike organizers say the
measures are insufficient. Other commodities expected to be
regulated include chicken, sugar and tomato paste.
   The police chief, Maj. Gen. Fernando Aristides Sanchez Aybar,
said Tuesday that public disorder would not be tolerated, and the
armed forces minister, Lt. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, said
soldiers would help police keep order.
   Some left-wing and labor groups complained their leaders were
arrested without warrants and were being held without charges.

   Seventy-year-old Joe Redington dashed out
of this checkpoint Wednesday in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race, declaring, ``I feel like an old fox being chased by 50
young hounds.''
   The second-oldest racer in the Anchorage-to Nome mushing
marathon left this Kuskokwim River town after staying about four
hours to feed and rest his 14 dogs.
   Known as the Father of the Iditarod, the Wasilla resident helped
create the race 16 years ago but has never won, even though he has
competed nearly every year.
   Redington arrived in McGrath, 410 miles into the race, at 6:48
a.m. He was followed by Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref at 10:26 a.m.
Behind them, in order, were Jan Masek of Anchorage and Joe Garnie
of Teller.
   Two other mushers _ Joe Runyan of Nenana and Ralph ``Babe''
Anderson of McGrath _ also arrived in the morning but were not
among the leaders because they had not yet taken their mandatory
24-hour layovers.
   Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie took their layovers early in the
race, which began Saturday. That turned out to be a successful
strategy, because a pack of about 20 leading mushers later bogged
down in new snow. As those mushers took their 24-hour layover in
Rohn, they watched helplessly as Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie
sailed past on the smooth trail they had packed.
   One of those was the defending champion, Susan Butcher of
Manley, who was in fifth place.
   Some racers said that despite Redington's lead, Nayokpuk is now
the musher to beat because his dogs are stronger.
   ``I think it's going to take us quite a while to gain that kind
of time back, unless he runs into some kind of situation up
ahead,'' four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson said in Rohn.
   Meanwhile, at the back of the pack, Norman Vaughan announced
Wednesday that he was dropping out. Vaughan, at 82 the oldest
Iditarod musher, was the only one left at the Puntilla Lake
checkpoint, 290 miles behind the leaders. Another musher also
dropped out, leaving the number of competitors at 50.
   A $30,000 first prize awaits the winner in Nome, with the rest
of the $150,000 purse to be split among the next 19 finishers.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Halts IRS Efforts to Revoke PTL's Tax-Exempt Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court judge Wednesday
temporarily halted IRS efforts to revoke PTL's tax-exempt status.
   Judge William Williams of the 4th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., said the TV ministry built by Jim and Tammy Bakker
would suffer irreparable harm if it were determined later that the
IRS overstepped its authority.
   The judge set a March 31 hearing in Greenville, S.C., where PTL
attorneys are expected to argue that loss of tax-exempt status
would be a death blow to PTL, which is trying to reorganize under
bankruptcy court protection.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Karen Henderson had ruled that
the Internal Revenue Service could revoke PTL's tax-exempt status.
She overturned a December order by a Bankruptcy Court judge, saying
that court had no authority to stop the IRS.
   As a religious organization, PTL does not have to pay tax on the
donations that finance its religious work.
   PTL is trying to raise about $4 million by May 2 and emerge from
bankruptcy court. If it loses its tax-exempt status now, thousands
of contributors will be frightened off, the ministry said.
   The IRS wants to revoke its status retroactively to 1981 and
seek at least $55.7 million in back taxes. In effect, the IRS has
suggested that Bakker wasn't running a ministry but a profitable
business for himself, relatives and friends.

<HEAD>Shamir Expresses Surprise At Criticism From Senators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
expressed astonishment Wednesday at a letter from 30 senators who
said Israel should be willing to give up control of occupied land
in return for Middle East peace.
   ``Your letter came as a surprise, at a crucial moment in the
peace efforts,'' Shamir wrote in a three-page response. ``We were
astonished by the words of criticism you leveled at us on the
formula of `territory for peace.'''
   Shamir's letter was sent to Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., said Levin administrative assistant Gordon
Kerr. Both senators, strong supporters of Israel, were out of town
and unavailable for comment Wednesday night.
   Twenty-three Democratic and seven Republican senators had sent a
letter to Shamir last week in which they noted that Israel in the
past had supported the idea of ``land for peace'' by returning the
Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.
   They noted that Shamir had rejected ``this expression of
territory for peace'' and expressed hope that the prime minister's
statement ``did not indicate that Israel is abandoning a policy
that offers the best hope for long-term peace.''
   Shamir, in his response, said Israel accepts the U.N. Security
Council resolution that provides for an Israeli withdrawal from
land captured in the 1967 war but he did not agree to Israel's
eventual withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza.
   Shamir said the occupied territories were a different matter
than the Sinai Peninsula because they ``were occupied militarily
and illegally by Jordan and Egypt.''
   Shamir also warned against any waning in America's commitment to
the Camp David Accords, saying: ``If we are going to lose faith in
solemn American and Egyptian commitments under these accords how
can we be assured of future commitments that will require us to
take even further risks to our security and future?''
   Shamir is due in Washington next week for meetings with
President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz.

   A former Black Panther whose conviction in
the murders of two prison guards during a 1971 escape attempt was
overturned was ordered released on $350,000 bail Wednesday after 21
years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, who previously granted
Johnny Spain a new trial in the San Quentin Six case, rejected a
state to delay the setting of bail.
   Spain, 38, could be released from the California Medical
Facility at Vacaville as early as Thursday, lawyers said.
   ``Mr. Spain would walk from here to Vacaville on hot coals
before he would betray'' the people posting bail, said his lawyer,
Dennis Riordan.
   Wednesday's ruling was the second court victory in as many days
for Spain. He has been behind bars for more than half his life,
since his arrest in 1966 for a murder and robbery in Los Angeles.
   On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Parker
ordered Spain paroled immediately from the sentence he has been
serving for the 1966 murder, paving the way for Henderson to grant
bail for the 1971 case.
   Spain apparently joined the Black Panther Party after entering
prison.
   He became the only prisoner convicted of murder in a bloody
escape attempt that took the lives of militant leader George
Jackson, two other prisoners and three San Quentin guards.
   The other members of the San Quentin Six were either convicted
of lesser charges or acquitted.
   Henderson granted Spain a new trial in 1986, saying he had been
denied a fair trial by being required to wear heavy shackles for
every court appearance during the five years of proceedings. The
state is appealing that ruling.
   Parker on Tuesday found that Spain was eligible for immediate
parole in the 1966 case because the parole board had improperly
lengthened his sentence six years by applying 1976 regulations to
disciplinary violations committed in 1970 and 1971.
   Riordan said Spain has been recommended for parole by numerous
prison staffers, including a close friend of one of the slain
guards, and two congressmen.
   The lawyer said Spain had spent twice as long in prison as the
average sentence for a similar crime.

   Vice President George Bush stood within reach of the Republican
presidential nomination today after a clean sweep of Super Tuesday
primaries. Albert Gore Jr. added a Southern dynamic to the
Democratic race, splitting a rich harvest of delegates with Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   ``It exceeded my fondest expectations,'' exulted Bush as he
surveyed his 16-0 shutout Tuesday and looked ahead to an Illinois
showdown next Tuesday, where another victory over Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole would give his nomination an aura of inevitability.
   Super Tuesday spelled disaster for Dole, fellow Republican Pat
Robertson, and Democrat Richard Gephardt, all three teetering on
the verge of elimination after rejection in state after state.

   Panama's military regime could find itself
subject to ``a whole panoply'' of economic sanctions by the end of
this week, including the withholding of $6.5 million this month for
use of the Panama Canal, U.S. officials say.
   Final decisions on the sanctions are expected at an inter-agency
meeting scheduled Thursday, said the officials, who insisted on
anonymity. A formal announcement is likely either Thursday or
Friday, they added.
   The economic punishment is intended to aggravate an already
acute cash shortage in that country and pressure military strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega out of office.

   Two military helicopters collided
during a night training mission, killing up to 17 servicemen, an
official said today.
   The collision of the U-H 60 Blackhawk helicopters occurred about
9:45 p.m. Tuesday, 6 miles west southwest of Fort Campbell Army Air
Field, said Major Randy Schoel, Fort Campbell public information
officer.
   The Blackhawk is the military's newest helicopter, but has been
plagued by design flaws. Last summer, officials said that about 40
people had been killed in crashes of the helicopter since 1978.

impeachment trial.
   Meanwhile, Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon Jr., presiding over the
Senate trial, decided Tuesday to bar further testimony challenging
the credibility of Department of Public Safety Director Ralph

even if Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega goes the United States may be
backing the wrong replacement.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, the ousted president Washington supports,
tried to dismiss Noriega on Feb. 25 as commander of the Panama
Defense Forces. Noriega arranged for the legislature to dismiss
Delvalle instead, and the political and economic crisis has
deepened since.
   ``The United States is mistaken in putting so much behind
Delvalle,'' said Luis Moreno, former manager of Chase Manhattan
Bank's local operations and until January 1987 a member of the
government Banking Commission. Moreno, an independent, met
regularly with the president and Cabinet ministers.
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle, now
in hiding in Panama, as the country's legitimate leader and is is
applying economic pressure in an effort to get him back in office.

   President Reagan revisited the

stamp in honor of Knute Rockne, telling students that the legendary
football coach's life exemplified ``the faith that makes things

   Reagan told his audience that the role of the young athlete
George Gipp in the film ``Knute Rockne, All-American,'' ``was a
young actor's dream'' but that playing in a film about Rockne meant
more than that'to him.
   ``I know that, to many of you today, Rockne is a revered name, a
symbol of greatness and, yes, a face on a postage stamp,'' he said.
``But my generation, well, we actually knew the legend as it
happened _ we saw it unfold. And we felt it was saying something
important about us as a people and a nation.
   ``Most of all, the Rockne legend meant this ... that on or off
the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is faith that
makes great things happen.''

<HEAD>Church Break-in's Remain Mystery Despite FBI Probe Citing Churches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of odd break-ins have occurred over a
period of four years involving groups opposed to U.S. policies in
Central America.
   In many cases, the targets were sanctuary churches providing
haven to Salvadoran and Guatamalan refugees. The burglaries had a
strange similarity. Files and records were ransacked, or taken. But
no valuables were missing.
   ``It's never been solved,'' says David Lerner, spokesman for the
Center for Constitutional Rights, which has documented the puzzling
series of cases. ``The smoking gun has not been found.''
   A House subcommittee investigated the incidents last year, and
determined no perpetrator. Church workers had testified that it
appeared some federal agency was involved, but that fact was not
established.
   The mystery deepened when the constitutional center, through the
Freedom of Information Act, in January obtained more than 1,200
pages of heavily censored FBI files on a five-year investigation of
the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador
(CISPES), that cited about 25 U.S. religious groups.
   They include Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish groups, and
repeatedly mention the sanctuary movement, several of whose leaders
were convicted in 1986 for harboring undocumented aliens.
   But ``the break-ins are not reflected in the documents,'' Lerner
said. ``We just don't have the answer yet.
   ``That doesn't mean the FBI had not participated. We have good
reason to believe there was a connection between the break-in's and
this investigation, and we hope to get to the bottom of it.''
   He said the center, through its lawsuit, still was to receive
other FBI files from regional offices.
   Several of the religious groups mentioned in the FBI reports
strongly protested being brought under surveillance.
   As an example of the references, Lerner cited this passage in a
April 2, 1984, report from the Dallas FBI special agent to
headquarters in Washington:
   ``Investigation has determined CISPES is very closely connected
with the U.S. Catholic Church. The church, which agrees with most
CISPES philosophy, has set aside various sanctuaries to be used to
house illegal Salvadorans in the United States...''
   Actually, various Protestant churches _ Methodist, Episcopal,
Presbyterian, Baptist, Unitarian-Universalist and Lutheran _ as
well as Jewish and Catholic congregations, are among the more than
300 offering sanctuary.
   FBI Director William Sessions has defended the surveilance of
CISPES on suspicion the Washington-based group was subversively
aiding Marxist rebels in El Salvador, which he termed
``terrorist,'' but no criminal activity was found.
   He conceded ``mistakes'' may have been made in the
investigation's mushrooming to other groups. Lerner said about l60
organizations are named in the FBI files, including these religious
groups:
   U.S. Catholic Conference, National Council of Churches, World
Council of Churches, American Friends Service Committee, Friends
Religious Society, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, New
Jewish Agenda, Maryknoll Sisters, Sisters of Bernedict and Sisters
of Mercy.
   Among local religious centers mentioned were:
   Mennonite Church, Pittsburgh; Corpus Christi Catholic Church,
Oklahoma City; St. Williams Roman Catholic Church, Louisville, Ky.;
St. Luke's Presbyterian Church, Minitonka, Minn.; Walker Methodist
Community and Twin-City Friends Meeting, Minneapolis, Thomas Merton
Center, Pittsburgh, and a Milwaukee-based food program run by the
Society of St. Paul.
   The Maryknoll Sisters, based in Maryknoll, N.Y., said in a
statement that the FBI actions ``threaten the rights of all U.S.
citizens and place in jeopardy the democratic principles upon which
this country is founded.''
   The Rev. Arie Brouwer, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, noted the surveillance involved various groups
differing with U.S. policy in Central America and said:
   ``This sort of abuse of governmental power and authority has
occurred in our society almost invariably when the U.S. is involved
in what is widely perceived in this country as military adventurism
abroad.
   ``Foreign and domestic human rights abuses often go together.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, a United Methodist and president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said the surveillance
``smacks of the kind of behavior that we accuse the Kremlin of
performing.''
   Sister Linda Rich, a member of the Sisters of Divine Province
and staff member of the Thomas Merton Center in Pittsburgh, said it
had evidence in recent years of ``some FBI surveilance and
informants coming to our meetings.
   ``We conduct our activities and meetings very openly and feel
that simply because we dissent from government policies, that
doesn`t warrant them investigating us.''

Baptist president that voided a convention vote and helped
consolidate power of a fundamentalist wing.
   The disputed parliamentary procedure occurred in 1985 when the

   In less than a generation, Japan has slashed its
infant death rate to the lowest in the world, thanks to a formula
that combines intensive prenatal care with government policy.
   But Japan also has one of the world's highest abortion rates,
which could help in keeping figures low for the infant-death rate.
   The officially reported infant mortality rate, in any case, has
fallen from a high of more than 60 deaths per 1,000 in the years
after World War II to 4.9 per 1,000 in 1987 _ meaning that of every
1,000 babies born, 995.1 will live to their first birthdays.
   No other nation comes close. The United States lags far behind
with a rate of 10.6 per 1,000. Finland and Sweden rank second
behind Japan, with 6.0, according to 1986 figures.
   Experts list several things that led to Japan's low rate:
   _A literate society eager for medical advice.
   _A system of universal health insurance.
   _A Maternal and Child Health Handbook, standard issue for every
pregnant woman since World War II, which has 58 pages of health
records and advice on pregnancy and child care from birth to age 6.
   A typical Japanese mother is a married woman in her late 20s _
the safest ages for childbearing _ and she is pregnant with her
first or second child. The handbook tells her what to eat, how much
milk to drink and when to visit a doctor. By the time labor pains
begin she will have undergone about a dozen prenatal checkups, two
of them courtesy of the government.
   ``A Japanese mother is very interested in her own health and the
child to be born,'' said Dr. Kazuaki Miyagishima of the health
ministry's Maternal and Child Health Division. ``She follows
intensive prenatal care.''
   Like virtually all mothers of her generation, she gives birth in
a delivery room. Her hospital stay lasts a week, giving doctors
time to keep watch on the baby. Insurance takes care of most of the
costs, which usually run about 200,000 yen ($1,560). Depending on
need, the government will pay the rest, and add 100,000 yen ($780)
as a gift.
   Officials provide coupons for free checkups for the baby and
send a public health nurse to the home. Legions of volunteers pay
monthly house calls on rural newborns and report their progress to
local officials.
   But abortions are not figured in the official infant mortality
rate; the abortion figures themselves are difficult to establish.
   Japan's registered abortion rate is 17.1 per 1,000 women of
childbearing age, near the top among Western nations. Doctors say,
however, the real figure could be two to four times higher, because
not all abortions are reported to the government as required by
law. Adding the doctors' estimates of unreported abortions would
put Japan well ahead of the United States, which had a 1983 rate of
27.4 per 1,000.
   Officials say the hidden abortions take place among teen-agers.
While they accounted for only 5.4 percent of registered abortions
in 1986, that number has been rising along with teen pregnancies.
   Babies born to teens and women over 35 are at highest risk for
late fetal and early neonatal deaths. Women over 35 are almost
twice as likely to have infants with congenital defects.
   In Japan, the two groups of high-risk mothers account for 42
percent of registered abortions and only 8.8 percent of live
births. They are the only groups among whom abortion is increasing.
   ``Looking at the national statistics, it seems there could be a
link between a high rate of abortion among high-risk mothers and
the infant mortality rate,'' said Dr. Eikichi Matsuyama, director
of obstetrics and gynecology at Tokyo's Kosei Nenkin Hospital, when
asked why the figures showed infant mortality at the bottom and
abortions near the top. ``It's a connection I've never thought of
until now. But it's not illogical.''
   Japan's Eugenic Protection Law allows abortions even as late as
the second trimester of pregnancy to ``prevent the increase of
inferior descendants and to protect the life of the mother.''
   ``Abortion is quite a big program in Japanese family planning,''
said Haruo Konagai of the Japan Family Planning Association.
``One-fourth of Japanese women have experienced abortions.''
   Matsuyama and others say that preventing high-risk births is not
the key to lowering infant mortality. They say it's an incidental
factor in an already successful program.
   But the government is pushing programs for telephone counseling
and sex education in schools to lower the teen-age abortion rate,
Miyagishima said.
   ``In general, mother and child health is on a high standard
already,'' he said. ``It is a very hard task to find a (new)
target.''

   If you're the sort who puts off planning your
weekend until Saturday morning, ``Great Weekend'' is probably just
the show you're looking for.
   This new one-hour show of news and information will help you
sort out your weekend by telling you what's happening and where.
   There's also a small side benefit. It offers adults a Saturday
morning alternative amid the glut of cartoon shows.
   ``I tend to plan my weekend rather spontaneously on Saturday
mornings,'' said George Merlis, the show's executive producer.
``This addresses that need. It tells you what you can do on the
weekend. On Valentine's Day weekend, for instance, we showed the
romantic getaways.
   ``Everything we've done has been reachable by the audience. We
don't play voyeur _ our host goes there but you can't. We also
offer information on medicine, tips to consumers, and the schedule
of sports you can see this weekend.''
   ``Great Weekend,'' which goes out live by satellite, is
currently telecast on 31 stations across the country. It picked up
12 new stations at the recent convention of the National
Association of Television Program Executives in Houston. The
co-hosts of the show are Dale Harimoto and Bob Goen.
   ``Before we went on, the opinion was expressed by one station
that only a network could do a show like this because we originate
from several points,'' said Merlis. ``But `Great Weekend' is
produced in association with USTV.''
   USTV is the program development arm of Hubbard Broadcasting Co.
of Minneapolis and has three transponders on a communications
satellite. Each transponder can handle two signals. Hubbard also
operates the CONUS news delivery service and TV Direct in
partnership with The Associated Press.
   ``We went on the air in January with 16 stations,'' said Merlis.
``The first station we picked up was the one that said only a
network could do this. For our show on Feb. 20 we had our
weatherman in Savannah, Ga., Bob Goen was in Calgary, Canada, Dale
Harimoto was in Los Angles and our news and medical news came out
of Minneapolis.''
   Merlis also runs a company that produces video press tours. Most
recently, Elizabeth Taylor appeared on talk shows across the
country to promote her new diet book without ever having to leave
Los Angeles.
   Merlis developed ABC's ``Good Morning America'' into a hit
program. He also has been a producer for ``The CBS Morning News,''
``The Dick Cavett Show'' and ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   ``Stanley Hubbard of Hubbard Broadcasting knew me from `Good
Morning America' and called me up and said he wanted to talk,''
Merlis said. ``I flew to Minneapolis. He asked me what I thought
about a weekend show that would be like `Good Morning America' but
looks at weekend activities. I said I'd like to watch one because I
get up early on Saturday and was tired of looking at the `Road
Runner.'
   ``Hubbard had already done surveys which showed an overwhelming
audience response to such a show. I did a demonstration pilot and
we went on the air Jan. 2.''
   Merlis said that every show he's produced has had a consumer
outlook. ``If it didn't, I gave it one,'' he said. ``We give out
information that's useful to people. I try to keep the audience's
viewpoint in mind and see what they can take away from the show.
What's useful in terms of enriching their lives.
   ``When I took over `Entertainment Tonight' I felt it was very
slickly produced, but it had no point of view. I felt the point of
view was that we're consumers of entertainment. We had to give the
viewer intelligent choices for his entertainment.''

<HEAD>Great Moments from `Nature'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN-CLAUDE BOUIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Where can network viewers find unabashed
predatory behavior, bizarre courtship rituals, unreconstituted male
chauvinism, clever deceptiveness and graphic sex scenes (with
closeups)?
   ``Ryan's Hope?'' ``Dallas'' reruns? ``Monday Night Football?''
``L.A. Law?''
   Perhaps. But this Sunday you'll find some of this and much more
in an unlikely place: ``Great Moments from Nature,'' where
scavenging, cavorting and sex take place almost as naturally as in
many network shows. Actually, only a fraction of the two-hour
special deals with animals' mating habits and anyway it's just an
exotic variation on the classic birds and bees routine.
   ``Great Moments'' draws from 30 of the 100 broadcasts in the
five years of the PBS series, ``Nature,'' that eclectic electronic
zoo where animals can be observed closely without being deprived of
their freedom.
   It stars such common predators as the coyote and the osprey,
which is the only bird of prey to feed exclusively on live fish.
There's also the very small, thieving kleptoparasite spider and the
vampire bat, who drinks the blood of sleeping sea lions.
   Courtship scenes feature the exquisite dance of the endangered
Japanese red-crowned crane and the horn-bashing of the Nubian Ibex.
   Dishonorable mention for male chauvinism goes to several
species, including the polar bear, who takes no part in cub-raising
and even attacks his brood.
   The abalone practices its brand of casual sex called broadcast
spawning. We also see a tiny baby octopus coming to life in the
Baja Lagoon and closeups of finned wasps mating in midflight.
   Nothing new if you grew up on a farm, just a bit more exotic. A
kind of healthy voyeurism, and a sign that the wildlife genre on TV
has come a long way.
   ``Filmmakers are more astute about how to film certain scenes
and when to capture things when they happen,'' said series
producer-director Fred Kaufman. ``We're showing things that people
would not normally get a chance to see. We get to see everything
that animals do. In earlier films, you wouldn't see the mating
sequence or the birthing sequence, they would just talk about it.''
   ``Great Moments'' is divided into four sections: environments,
predators and prey, courtship rituals, and animals and their young.
There are other aspects to ``Nature,'' but unfortunately, one of
the best programs on the subject, ``The Volcano Watchers,'' was
left out of this special, perhaps because it didn't fit the
wildlife theme.
   Included are scenes from past shows like ``The Flight of the
Condor,'' ``Kingdom of the Ice Bear'' and ``Sexual Encounters of
the Floral Kind,'' where the hammer orchid mimics the scent of the
female wasp and lures the male to pick up its pollen. The show may
be graphic and grisly at times, but it's no ``Animal House.''
   ``The audience understands what we're trying to do, that we're
not trying to be exploitative by showing a mating scene,'' said
narrator and executive editor George Page.
   ``Personally, I think it's the best way in the world for kids to
learn about sex,'' said Page, who is also director of science and
natural history programming for public station WNET-TV in New York.
   ``It's the best form of sex education. It's the classic one: the
birds and the bees. I think it's a totally harmless way for
children to be exposed to the idea of sex, and a lot of parents
obviously agree with that because we have a lot of children in the
audience,'' Page said.
   Much of the show's photography is incredible, mostly because of
the contributions by such masters as Hugh Miles, formerly of the
BBC, and Wolfgang Bayer, based in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The music by
Broadway show composer Stephen Schwartz in several of the segments
more than makes up for some of the writing, which occasionally
smacks of the ``golly gee'' school of journalism.
   The series is produced in association with The Nature
Conservancy, one of the largest national conservation groups, which
buys property in ecologically endangered areas to save them from
development. An industry organization, the American Gas
Association, provides a grant, but most of the series' annual
budget of $3.4 million comes from Public Television Service
stations and public contributions.

<HEAD>A Fresh Look at Real Estate Partnerships</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sponsors of real estate limited partnerships are
busy hawking their wares these days as an alternative to the
vagaries of the stock and bond markets.
   Their selling job, they confess, isn't an easy one. Many savers
and investors have the impression that real estate investments,
especially in partnership form, have lost a lot of their appeal
since tax reform.
   That is certainly true of the ``tax shelter'' breed of
partnerships that were once the mainstay of the business.
   But partnership sponsors have shifted their sights these days to
vehicles emphasizing high yields that can grow over time, and still
offer something of a tax break.
   In fact, they seek to compete directly with such other
tax-favored investments as municipal bonds.
   ``The income type of venture is as attractive as before, or
maybe even more so,'' says William Brennan, a Valley Forge, Pa.,
adviser on tax and investment planning. ``Syndicators are now
concentrating on economics rather than tax benefits.''
   Brennan and other analysts caution, however, that real estate
partnerships require careful study and evaluation before you commit
any money to them.
   A typical partnership is offered through securities brokers in
units of $1,000, with a normal minimum purchase of $5,000. After
the offering, the general partner takes the money raised and
invests in a variety of properties.
   For example, W.P. Carey & Co., a New York-based sponsor of seven
partnerships to date, specializes in buying commercial property
like warehouses and office buildings from businesses and leasing it
back to them.
   Its aim is to realize income from the lease payments and pass it
through to the limited partners, with a tax break for depreciation
deductions. At the end of the partnership's life _ usually 10 to 12
years _ there is also the hope that the properties can be sold at a
profit.
   As in many other real estate investments, a partnership like
this is a long-term proposition. It can be difficult to sell a
partnership interest under favorable terms before the end of its
scheduled period of operation.
   ``The first question to ask is do I have enough liquidity to tie
my money up like this,'' Brennan says.
   A second point to consider, he adds, is that while a real estate
partnership offers a ``reasonably predictable income stream,'' its
prospective yield is not as definite as that of a bond or similar
fixed-income security.
   Would-be investors also should inquire about fees and
commissions charged at the start and through the years of the
partnership's operation, and the reputation and past record of the
sponsor.
   ``The track record of the sponsor is much more important than
up-front fees,'' argues William Carey, chairman of the Carey firm.
   Brennan cautions that the old investment maxim ``past
performance is no guarantee of future results'' applies. But in
deals like this, he adds, ``it's all we have to go on.''
   Fee structures tend to be pretty similar in most partnerships
offered to the public, Brennan says, but their styles of operation
and the degrees of risk they take can vary widely.
   No real estate partnership is as safe a bet as a
government-guaranteed investment such as Treasury bills or U.S.
Savings Bonds.
   If the stock market crash last fall has you worrying about hard
times ahead for the national economy, you may sleep better with
your money in investments that come with a guarantee.
   Brennan also notes that potential partnership investors should
also weigh alternatives that are continuously traded _ so-called
master limited partnerships or real estate investment trusts.
   These have the advantage of an an existing package of properties
open to your scrutiny, he says, and may be priced more attractively
than a new offering.

<HEAD>Main Religious Bodies Launching First Interfaith TV Network</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's mainline faiths, mostly missing from
television's sweeping purview in recent years, are launching a new,
unprecedented ecumenical network on the nation's cable TV systems.
   Plans for it were confirmed in interviews this week, with a
partial start-up expected in midsummer, expanding to 18 to 20 hours
daily in the fall.
   ``A fresh, new wind is coming across the country's television
screens,'' said the Rev. Daniel Paul Matthews, a Manhattan
Episcopalian and board chairman of Vision Interfaith Satellite
Network.
   Called ``VISN,'' it will shun soliciting money, as typifies
individual TV religious preachers. But it has financial backing of
the industry, and projects sustaining commercial sponsorship.
   ``It's an idea whose time has come in market need and consumer
need,'' said David Ochoa of Nashville, Tenn., a United Methodist
and president and chief executive officer of the enterprise.
   ``For years, the mainline denominations have been on the
sidelines, but they've finally got off their duffs and are doing
something.''
   Ochoa, who owns a cable channel in Los Angeles and who also is
communications chief for United Methodism's board of higher
education and ministry, added:
   ``It's the first time mainline faith groups, Protestant, Roman
Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish, have worked together to
create a new TV programming service for people of faith
nationwide.''
   Religious television in recent times has been dominated by
individuals, such as the fallen TV personalities Jim Bakker and
Jimmy Swaggart, giving a limited impression of religion.
   ``We've been getting personal pietism exclusively slanted toward
a narrow perspective,'' Matthews said. ``This is a valid piece of
the pie, but it gave a distorted image of American religious life.''
   Matthews, with extensive TV experience in Knoxville, Tenn., and
Atlanta, before becoming rector of Manhattan's Trinity Church, said
the new network would reflect historic faiths that have been the
``backbone of America.''
   Actively involved are most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox
denominations, plus some evangelical and Jewish bodies. Officials
said Roman Catholics are expected to join through decisions of
bishops late this month.
   Officials emphasized that added participation of evangelical
groups was sought, including Southern Baptists, who already operate
their own cable network.
   Several factors largely have pushed mainline faiths off network
television, including aversion to soliciting money, plus
deregulation of broadcasting, which made public service time
unnecessary and mostly unavailable.
   This combination spurred individual preaching entrepreneurs to
take over the field, fervently appealing for donations, raising
huge amounts to buy their TV time.
   A catalyst for the new network was one of the largest cable
systems in the country, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), based in
Denver. It dropped Baker's scandal-linked network, and sought a
more broadly based religious component.
   A key influence was research showing less than 10 percent of
Americans watched the individual preaching shows, leaving a large
segment of religious people concerned with broader faith
commitments.
   TCI executives, along with those of about 20 other cable
systems, met last year with a recently organized National
Interfaith Cable Coalition, and plans for the new network took life
and have snowballed since.
   Officials said the cable industry is providing ``bridge
financing'' loans to get the network started, with TCI leading the
way, in costs for facilities, staffing and satellite rental
expected to be up to $5 million.
   Programming is to come from the denominations, which already
have many highly rated productions available but so far with little
outlet for them.
   ``Some of the most exciting, extraordinarily good television
programming simply hasn't had broad distribution, although it has
every bit of innovative broadcast quality,'' said William Airy,
operations consultant for the new network.
   ``From a programmers viewpoint, it's like being turned loose in
a candy store, with all the fine resources existing there, but
which nobody even knows about.'' Airy, of Albuquerque, N. Mex,
formerly ran an all-music Gospel channel.
   Plans are for prime-time programs to be of a broad value-based
nature that will attract commercial advertising revenue.
   Nelson Price of New York, head of United Methodist
communications, and board member for the new network, said 12 to 15
cable companies, besides TCI, were moving to help underwrite start
of the venture.
   He said programs would include examinations of social issues,
dramas and entertainment faithful to moral-ethical precepts,
interfaith films and programs for special audiences such as
children, the elderly and single parents.
   A standards and practicers committee has set these rules for
content:
   No material that denigrates or maligns any other faith or
religion; no programs that proseletyze to gain members at expense
of other churches, and no use of time to solicit funds.
   Price said, ``VISN is a historic undertaking that brings
together a diverse group of religious traditions to create and
sustain a positive approach to religious programming.''

   She goes by old values: an honest day's work for
an honest day's pay ... live within your means ... save money for a
rainy day ... support the police. To Margaret Thatcher, that's also
the formula for the success of a nation. It is essentially the
basis for the Thatcher Revolution, which has put a staggering
Britain steady on its feet again. But her critics say it is at a
heavy price.

   Far from losing steam after nearly nine years in
office, Margaret Thatcher is marching through her third consecutive
term as prime minister looking more confident and powerful than
ever.
   The 62-year-old Conservative Party leader has become such a
fixture on the political scene, here and abroad, that at times she
seems to be parodying the bossy, schoolmarmish image bestowed on
her by her critics.
   She'll let loose an outburst every so often _ ``I never did
understand men,'' she complained after an argumentative European
summit meeting. She'll chide the United States about balancing its
budget and badger her citizens about littering the streets.
   She advocates a return to ``Victorian values,'' supports the
restoration of the death penalty, has legislated curbs on the
promotion of homosexual lifestyles, and brandishes the Official
Secrets Act with a vigor that makes many critics fear for the
freedom of the British media.
   Now, eight months into a fresh five-year term, the blonde mother
of twins has governed continuously for longer than any other
British prime minister in the 20th century. In the process, she
says, she has wrought a revolution. It's a claim that not even her
severest critics now totally dismiss.
   ``She has taught us that you don't win ... unless you have a
clear ideological position,'' says Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of
the socialistic Labor Party, which went down to its third
successive election defeat by Mrs. Thatcher last June. ``We've made
authoritarianism look respectable _ or, rather, she has.''
   As the Thatcher Revolution surges on with shake-ups in state
education, housing and the once-sacrosanct National Health Service,
authoritarianism is the most frequent charge against her.
   But polls indicate that Mrs. Thatcher retains her trump card: a
feeling among the United Kingdom's 56 million people that, whether
or not they like her policies, no one is offering anything more
credible. The disarray in the left-of-center opposition gives her
an unassailable Parliament majority on just 42 percent of the
popular vote.
   The voting pattern illustrated the divisions and polarization
evident in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain. Tories swept the elections in
prosperous southern England but won not a single seat in the House
of Commons in the north's five major cities, where unemployment and
cuts in government spending are felt most acutely.
   ``She, more powerfully than anyone else, has articulated the
moral doubts and yearnings of her age,'' wrote Peter Jenkins, a
leading liberal analyst, in his recent book, ``Mrs. Thatcher's
Revolution.''
   ``For what people wanted, surely, was an end to decline, release
from the corrosive sense of failure, a government which governed
and a country to begin to be proud of once again.''
   Mrs. Thatcher feels her populist, anti-elitist instincts are
``absolutely in tune with how people feel ... not just in their
pockets, but in their bones, in their hearts and in their minds.
Deep in their instincts they find what I am saying and doing
right.''
   She attributes it all to what she learned from, her father,
Alfred Roberts, a smalltown grocer.
   ``My policies are based not on some economic theory, but on
things that I and millions like me were brought up with,'' she has
said.
   ``An honest day's work for an honest day's pay, live within your
means, put a nest egg by for a rainy day, pay your bills on time,
support the police.''
   Such is the message of her revolution.
   Her laws have curbed the labor unions and nurtured a new breed
of entrepreneurs who, like Mrs. Thatcher, are outsiders to the
establishment.
   Among the 200 richest Britons, self-made chain store
billionaires, computer whizkids and property tycoons outnumber the
landed aristocracy and other old money 2 to 1, according to Money
Magazine, a British publication.
   Britain, the strike-plagued ``sick man of Europe'' in the 60s
and 70s, is now ranked by Ambassador Toshio Yamazaki of Japan as an
Olympics gold-medalist of business with ``one of the great
reforming governments of the century.''
   ``I have noticed not only a genuine economic resurgence but also
a new attitude,'' Yamazaki told the 1988 convention of the British
Institute of Directors. ``The British seem to be enjoying success.''

   Unemployment is down from a peak 12 percent two years ago to 9.2
percent, lower than West Germany and France; inflation hovers
around 4 percent, down from more than 20 percent in the early
Thatcher years. Britain's economic growth topped the West European
league last year, while reins on state spending have produced a
series of trim, low-deficit budgets.
   Mrs. Thatcher has steadily chopped away at tax rates at the
highest income levels, which had reached 86 percent when she took
over from Prime Minister James Callaghan's Labor government in
1979. Her government succeeded in getting the top rate down to 60
percent and proposes to cut them even more this year.
   Currency exchange controls are gone, and the blossoming of the
City, London's financial district, into a global trading giant is
just one sign of the radically changed business climate.
   But not everybody is better off, and much remains unchanged in
Thatcher's Britain.
   A stubbornly class-conscious society survives with waiting lists
for expensive, private high schools swelled by the children of the
newly prosperous.
   People's accents still matter and are discussed _ including Mrs.
Thatcher's, because it sounds acquired.
   Critics who accuse Mrs. Thatcher of under-funding the National
Health Service in favor of private medicine point to the three
small children who died this year after heart surgery was delayed
for lack of nurses at Birmingham Children's Hospital.
   Nine years after a woman became prime minister, British women
are not noticeably better off. They still do most of the boring
low-paid jobs and earn an average of 145 pounds ($255) a week,
compared with 219.40 pounds ($386) for the average male.
   According to a survey published in February by the state-funded
Equal Opportunities Commission, women comprise 60 percent of bank
employees but only 2 percent of the administrative and managerial
staff. Mrs. Thatcher has never had a woman in her Cabinet.
   Says nurse Rebecca Malby, 24: ``I find her whole attitude
totally out of tune with what young women think ... her references
to the importance of staying home and raising children . .. the
poor pay of women-dominated professions.''
   Everything about the grocer's daughter, from her frilly blouses
and tinted hair to her right-wing views, offends a large section of
the intellectual and cultural establishment.
   ``Her odious suburban gentility and sentimental saccharine
patriotism caters to the worst elements of commuter idiocy,''
charges writer-director Jonathan Miller,
   The novelist Kingsley Amis retorts that the intellectuals are
simply snobs and says he detects resentment among the
intelligentsia that they, like the labor unions, are no longer
consulted by Mrs. Thatcher.
   Instead, she listens to small, right-wing think tanks like the
Institute for Economic Affairs, whose director, Graham Mather,
says: ``There's no doubt the free-market right has been taking the
offensive in recent years and has come to dominate much of the
policy discussion.
   ``The left, the collectivists, the socialists, the believers in
a corporate state, have almost opted out of the policy debate.''
   Internationally, Mrs. Thatcher has turned post-Empire Britain
into what commentator Brian Walden calls ``a medium-sized power _
with clout.''
   She is Washington's staunchest backer in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. In Western Europe, her partners in European
Economic Community may dislike her hectoring style and
preoccupation with budgets, but they no longer call Britain the
weakling in the group.
   She is the longest-serving leader in the NATO alliance, and
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union gave her
a red-carpet welcome in Moscow last spring. He stopped off to see
her in December on his way to meet President Reagan in Washington
to sign the treaty limiting nuclear weapons in Europe.
   ``If she sees herself as the de facto leader of the West, that
would give me not the slightest pain,'' former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger wrote recently in London's Sunday
Telegraph.
   ``I would like that. I have great hopes that even if she is not
the founder of a new Western structure, she can at least do what
the Roman tribunes used to do _ prevent the worst from happening.''

   In six years, George Davies has turned a dowdy,
obscure clothing company into Britain's biggest retail success
story of Margaret Thatcher's revolution _ a $1.75-billion empire
for budget-conscious yuppies.
   Raised in a working-class family in Liverpool, Davies is chief
executive and chairman of Next, a chain of nearly 500 stores, and
epitomizes the ``go-getter'' society Prime Minister Thatcher seeks
to create.
   At 46, Davies is not just an entrepreneur but a man eagerly
sought by business experts and the media attempting to assess the
Thatcher Revolution. He typifies the new class of young, self-made
entrepreneurs who have benefited from the lower taxes and improved
business climate of the Thatcher years.
   ``I think the British do produce entrepreneurs, but perhaps the
climate eight years ago didn't let them come through,'' Davies said
in a recent British TV interview, referring to the time before Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservatives took over from the Labor Party.
   ``So if someone like myself who is basically a working-class lad
can start as I did on stock control of ankle socks and come through
and do things I've always dreamed of and have a team that is
equally positive, one's got to say something's going right,'' he
said.
   Davies worked in the clothing trade for nearly 20 years before
his big break.
   In 1981, as a new senior executive with Hepworths, a relatively
little known clothing company, he spotted a gap in the market
between pricy designer clothes and the mass production of the
established chains.
   The first Next store opened in Wales in 1982 and they now cover
Britain. A mail order service Davies launched this year was swamped
with $10.8 million worth of orders in the first three weeks.
   Company headquarters remain in Leicester, an industrial city in
central England town near where Davies lives with his second wife,
Liz, in a 200-year-old rectory.
   He works six days a week, including Saturday evenings when on
his home computer he flips through the weekly takings from stores
around the country.
   In un-British tradition, Next employees call him George.
   ``It's attitudes that are divisive, not money,'' he says.

   At 24, Rebecca Malby is professionally a big
success, but she considers herself a loser in Margaret Thatcher's
revolution.
   Miss Malby is a nurse in charge of a 27-bed ward, mainly cardiac
patients, at Whipps Cross hospital in a predominantly working-class
district of the East End of London.
   On a salary of 9,000-pounds ($15,750) a year after seven years
on the job, including gaining a postgraduate diploma, she makes
roughly the same as a rookie policeman and about one-third less
than many London secretaries.
   Her home is a rented room in the house of two young doctors in
London's far-from-gentrified Stoke Newington district and her major
luxury is a second-hand car.
   She sees no prospect of buying her own apartment unless she
gives up the car, vacations and most entertainment.
   But she loves her job, enthuses about being young and in London,
believes passionately in the state-funded National Health Service,
plans to train as a nursing manager _ and thinks Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher simply doesn't care.
   ``We think twice about ordering a brain scan on stroke patients
now because of what it will cost,'' says Miss Malby, one of 515,000
nurses employed by the financially ailing state health service,
which is used by 90 percent of Britons.
   Mrs. Thatcher usually answers such criticism by showing
statistics she says prove spending on health has increased. She
says her aim is not to weaken the service but to streamline it by
shifting funds from the health bureaucracy to the patients.
   ``She (Mrs. Thatcher) has made us think much more about what
we're doing and there's nothing wrong with that,'' says Miss Malby.
``But we're on the edge now ... and she doesn't actually listen to
anybody. She is driven by ideology and just determined we're going
to have a mainly private health service.''
   Miss Malby says she's not tempted into another career and hasn't
seriously considered joining the hundreds of British nurses who
leave annually to double their pay in jobs in U.S. hospitals.
   ``When I think of them (the government) lowering taxes again for
wealthy people, it just seems a crime,'' she says.

   In ``Wetherby,'' a 1985 movie about alienated
English intellectuals, a character ruminates tipsily on what
Margaret Thatcher is doing to his country.
   ``Revenge! That's what she's doing. ... Taking some terrible
revenge. ... And now the whole country is suffering. And yet we've
done nothing to her.''
   The outburst is almost a metaphor for the arts in Britain today
after nearly a decade of Thatcherism: enraged, unfocused, sometimes
venomous to a degree never experienced by a prime minister this
century.
   So deep is Mrs. Thatcher's imprint on society that she often
becomes a stage character in her own right, whether as a
cigar-chomping fascist in the satirical TV revue ``Spitting
Image,'' or as Nanny, leader of the rapacious, authoritarian Money
Party in Pete Davies's novel ``The Last Election.''
   Now she returns in the hit movie ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,''
which features a Thatcher speech on slum-clearance over footage of
an urban wasteland.
   Anti-Thatcherism is not confined to left-wing artists.
Conservative novelists also rail against Mrs. Thatcher's
``go-getter society,'' which they claim is drowning Ye Olde
Englande in a greedy money-and-fast-food culture.
   The spate of recent movies with anti-Thatcher messages provoked
an angry article in the Sunday Times by the right-wing historian
Norman Stone of Oxford University in which he claimed that ``the
done thing is to run down Mrs. Thatcher, to assume that capitalism
is parasitism, that the established order in this country is
imperialist, racist, profiteering.''
   Hanif Kureishi, who wrote the award-winning movie ``My Beautiful
Laundrette'' and the ``Sammy and Rosie'' film, responded by
accusing Stone of ``creative impotence and snobbishness.'' Kureishi
insisted the Britain shown in his films is authentic: ``An
intolerant, racist, homophobic, narrow-minded, authoritarian
rathole.''
   The cultural battle, observed the Economist magazine, signifies
``that Mrs. Thatcher is not just the first prime minister of the
century to have an `-ism' attached to her name. She is also
believed by her opponents ... to have so stamped her values on the
country that it has almost become a personal fief.''

<HEAD>Old Farm Credit System May Be in Intensive Care for Some Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The creaky old Farm Credit System is being
rejuvenated, but it'll take a while before the 72-year-old
financial empire starts feeling its oats again.
   It's more than just a face lift, says an Agriculture Department
economist. More like a transplant of key innards, along with $4
billion worth of new blood and muscle.
   The surgery was performed by Congress in the Agricultural Credit
Act of 1987, which was signed into law by President Reagan on Jan.
6. Losses to the system totaled about $4.8 billion over the last
two years and the outlook was grim.
   Although other components came along later, a cornerstone of the
FCS since 1916 has been the federal land banks. Other parts include
intermediate credit banks and banks for cooperatives. Altogether,
some 37 banks and hundreds of local associations have made up the
system's cooperative network.
   In all, the FCS has a $50 billion loan portfolio representing
about a third of the U.S. farm debt.
   ``While federal assistance allows the FCS to operate in the
shortrun, the help is not cheap,'' says Merritt Hughes of the
department's Economic Research Service. ``Changes included a
reorganization of the system, additional rights for its borrowers,
and additional measures to ensure the institution's future.''
   Structurally, the FCS won't be the same. For example, within six
months the federal land banks and the federal intermediate credit
banks must merge. Other mergers between FCS institutions and
districts may follow, she said. The banks for cooperatives must
also decided whether to consolidate.
   The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the federal agency that
oversees the cooperative system, will have expanded regulatory
responsibilities and powers ``along the lines of those already
existing for other types of financial institutions,'' Ms. Hughes
said.
   Newly created components will include an insurance corporation
to insure debt obligations of the system. A separate Farm Credit
Assistance Board has been formed to administer the federal bail-out
of the system and ensure that units getting aid take necessary
steps to reduce costs.
   A secondary market for agricultural real estate loans and
certain rural housing loans will be handled by a new autonomous
institution within FCS called the Federal Agricultural Mortgage
Corp., which already has been dubbed ``Farmer Mac,'' she said.
   ``Reorganizing the FCS will reduce overhead cost as the number
of FCS entities declines,'' Ms. Hughes said. ``Farmer Mac is
expected to bring in additional income.''
   Although there will be added costs associated with the new
administrative parts of FCS, the changes overall ``should result in
a more efficient implementation and delivery of loans'' to farmers,
she said.
   Insurance against operational failure will be targeted to a
number of areas, Ms. Hughes said. An internal fund will be created
to guarantee against default on system debt issuances.
   ``The new act requires FCS institutions to build up equity in
order to decrease interest rate exposure and stabilize net
income,'' she said. ``Banks will be able to charge loan origination
fees and issue non-voting, at-risk stock to raise the capital to
meet FCA-determined standards. Borrowers will not be allowed to
withdraw stock as their loans are repaid, and non-borrowers will be
able to purchase non-voting stock.''
   Ms. Hughes' analysis was reported in the March issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine published by the USDA agency.
   The FCS's recent troubles resulted from two simultaneous
developments: the near-collapse in the farm economy, and the
system's issuance of long-term bonds with high interest rates, Ms.
Hughes said.
   How would the system react in the future under repeat
circumstances?
   ``The FCS will likely be more capable of coping with a
recurrence of the first or these problems as capital is rebuilt,''
she said. ``If proportionately more income is generated from loan
origination fees and the sale of non-insured stock, the adverse
consequences of borrower default will be less of an issue.''
   In the case of unanticipated high interest rates, the impact on
the FCS ``may not be substantially reduced'' by the new
legislation, Ms. Hughes said. The new requirements call for a high
level of capital that can be easily drawn on during downswings.
   `` The level of capital is probably not as important as the
stability of capital (immunity from investor flight), since prior
to the mid-1980s the system had developed very large capital stock
without legislative prompting,'' she said.
   One of the problems in the old FCS was an inability to shuttle
financial help from one bank to another.
   The former Capital Corporation mandated by a 1985 law, for
example, was able to assess about $300 million from the various
banks but was able to collect only $175 million and actually
dispensed only $10 million, Ms. Hughes said. Formerly, the sharing
of capital among FCS institutions was in conflict with
reponsibilities to stockholders.
   ``The 1987 act permits a more flexible organizational structure
while at the same time requiring continues, rather than sporadic,
shared financial responsibility,'' she said.

   R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. has begun its $6.1 billion
tender offer for Federated Department Stores Inc. and has gone to
court in hopes of torpedoing the competing $6.18 billion offer by
Campeau Corp.
   Macy filed suit Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan seeking an
injunction to bar Campeau from proceeding with its tender offer on
the grounds that Campeau's amended bid was actually a new offer and
as such must remain open beyond its scheduled expiration at
midnight March 15.
   Extending Campeau's bid would reduce the pressure on Federated
shareholders to decide between the rival Macy and Campeau offers,
effectively putting the Macy offer _ which expires April 4 _ on
better footing.

   A key stock market indicator has risen to its highest level
since the October market crash, even as the dollar slipped further
against foreign currencies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 24.70 points to
close Tuesday at 2,081.07, its highest level since the Oct. 19
crash.
   Other market indices also rose, as two stocks advanced for every
one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Wall Street analysts said the rally partly reflected a desire by
managers of institutional investment funds to put unused money to
work as the first quarter draws to a close at the end of this month.
   Others said the increased interest in stocks reflected true
buying interest and waning anxiety by investors over the impact of
the October collapse, along with optimism over indications that the
economy is thriving.
   But many professional strategists were reluctant to declare that
the underlying post-crash nervousness has evaporated.
   In the currency markets, the dollar continued to slide as the
British pound soared and other major currencies took their cue from
sterling. Analysts said the British currency was buoyed by high
interest rates and the strength of the country's economy.
   Sterling rose to $1.8425 on Tuesday in New York from $1.8180
late Monday and has gained nearly 7 cents against the dollar in two
days.
   In the credit markets, bond prices finished little changed with
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ending the day barely below
where it ended Monday's trading session.
   Oil futures prices rose slightly in response to calls for
meetings among oil-producing nations over production and price
issues.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil,
settled at $15.45 per 42-gallon barrel, up 8 cents from Monday's
close.

   Oil prices have firmed slightly in response to
calls for meetings among oil-producing nations.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil,
settled at $15.45 per barrel Tuesday, up 8 cents from Monday's
close.
   Among refined products, wholesale heating oil gained 0.08 cent
to 43.49 cents a gallon. Near-term contracts for wholesale gasoline
dipped 0.23 cent to 43.71 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said longer-term contracts for both crude and the
products were stronger, reflecting sentiment that key world oil
producers may yet agree on ways to limit production and stabilize
prices.
   In gasoline, for example, the September contract gained 0.41
cent to 43.70 cents a gallon on hopes for firmer prices and a
strong summer driving season.
   Helping support prices Tuesday was Egypt's announcement that
non-OPEC oil producers would meet today in London. Venezuela also
reportedly called for more future meetings of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.
   Members of both groups appear anxious to address the problem of
price discounting by some oil producers, said Bob Baker, an analyst
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   But analysts said meetings alone would not dissolve the world's
oil glut.
   ``There will have to be some kind of results or we'll continue
to see these kinds of prices,'' said John Hill of Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures.

<HEAD>Digital Unveils VAX 8800 Series As Battle With IBM Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp.'s newest line of computers
should continue the company's process of chipping away at the
domination of industry giant International Business Machines Corp.,
analysts said.
   Digital, the world's second largest computer company, introduced
the VAX 8800 Series on Tuesday, boosting its mainframe capability
and issuing another salvo in the battle to be number one.
   ``It's not an earth-shattering announcement but it is a topper
in terms of price and capabilities,'' said Sonny Monosson, an
independent computer analyst in Boston. ``It is very capable and
will make inroads into the IBM market.''
   Maynard, Mass.-based Digital has mounted an aggressive campaign
to erode IBM's dominance in mid-sized computers and large
mainframes, or central processing units.
   Last fall, Digital introduced two new MicroVAX computers and
positioned them as competitors with IBM's 9370, a mid-sized
computer that came out last summer.
   In January, Digital and Apple Computer Inc. announced a joint
development pact _ specifically designed to challenge IBM _ that
would make VAX programs available on Apple's Macintosh computers.
   The newest line of VAX computers is priced from $543,900 to more
than $1.7 million.
   Digital said the VAX 8800 Series delivers up to four times the
processing power of the 8700 series with multiprocessing
capabilities. The series is designed for large, multifaceted
companies.
   ``This does intensify the competition,'' said Howard Anderson,
managing director of Yankee Group, a Boston-based market research
firm. ``Historically what happened is that DEC has great software
and underpowered computers. Every time DEC comes out with a
high-powered machine, its users, who have been power starved, grab
it up.''
   Despite the announcement, Digital stock fell $4 a share to
$120.37{ a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Analysts said Digital had been expected to announce new software
in conjunction with the new computers. When the company didn't,
analysts lowered their earnings forecasts, which may have helped
depress Digital's stock price.
   The company said VAX 8700s can be upgraded to the new line,
which is available immediately, and analysts said they expect a
60-40 split between upgrading and new sales. Analysts said they
expect the VAX 8800 Series to offer strong competition for IBM's
4300 Series and 4381 model.
   ``What we have seen is that the largest users are assuming there
are only two companies acceptable for all applications _ IBM and
DEC,'' Anderson said. ``Two years ago it was only IBM.''

hostile $1.03 billion takeover offer for Stop & Shop Cos. marks the
latest of Dart's series of unsuccessful but profitable attempts to
acquire a major retailing chain.
   Dart said in a brief statement Tuesday that it would let its $37
a share tender offer expire at midnight EST tonight return all
tendered shares to Stop & Shop stockholders.
   Stop & Shop, a supermarket and discount department store
operator, said Feb. 29 it had agreed to be acquired in a $44 a
share, $1.23 billion leveraged buyout led by the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   A Dart spokesman, who did not wish to be identified, said the
Landover, Md.-based company felt it was ``uneconomic to bid
further.''
   Dart, which owns about 2.7 percent of Stop & Shop's 27.9 million
common shares outstanding, nevertheless stands to profit from its
abortive takeover try.
   Dart reportedly acquired its 730,000 Stop & Shop shares at
prices below $20 a share, giving them a potential pre-tax gain of
at least $17.5 million if it tendered its shares under the
company's buyout.
   Stop & Shop closed at $43.50 a share Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 12{ cents from Monday's close.
   Dart, which had launched its takeover bid with a $31 a share
offer on Feb. 1, in recent years has developed a reputation as a
corporate raider that launches hostile takeover bids and later
pockets huge profits by selling its stock to another suitor or to
the target company.
   Dart since 1985 has been spurned in takeover bids by several
major retailers, including Safeway, Beatrice Cos., Supermarkets
General Corp. and Dayton Hudson Corp.
   The company, which owns the Crown Books and Trak Auto Parts
retail chains, has maintained it wanted to acquire a major retail
chain as part of its long-term strategy.
   In addition to the Kohlberg Kravis buyout agreement, Dart faced
another obstacle in Stop & Shop's federal lawsuit to block the
hostile tender offer. Stop & Shop accused Dart of failing to
disclose that its purpose in making the bid was to boost the stock
price of the target company in order to make a speculative profit.
   Boston-based Stop & Shop owns 113 Stop & Shop supermarkets and
169 Bradlees discount department stores. In a leveraged buyout,
investors borrow heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the
debt with the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.

<HEAD>Judge To Review Ohio Takeover Law In Firestone-Pirelli Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has set a hearing for next week
to review the constitutionality of Ohio's anti-takeover law, but
has refused to immediately prevent Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. from
using the law to thwart a $1.86 billion buyout bid from Italian
tiremaker Pirelli.
   Judge Alice Batchelder rejected Pirelli's request for a
temporary restraining order against the law and set a hearing for
next Monday to review the statute's constitutionality.
   Attorneys for Pirelli Societe Generale SA went to U.S. District
Court in Cleveland on Monday in an effort to prevent Firestone from
using provisions of the Ohio Takeover Act, which attempts to hinder
hostile buyouts.
   Firestone rejected an earlier merger proposal from Pirelli in
favor of a venture under which it will sell 75 percent of its core
tire business to Bridgestone Corp. of Japan. That rejection led the
Italian tiremaker to launch its unsolicited tender offer for
Firestone on Monday.
   John J. Nevin, chairman of Firestone, stated late Monday that
the company's board was reviewing the offer and asking shareholders
to await its recommendation before deciding whether to tender their
stock to Pirelli, which is based in Milan.
   The board will complete its review by March 18, Nevin said.

   Mark Peabody's share of Ford Motor Co.'s
profits will go into a house he is building for his family. Mike
Heaslip is taking his to Las Vegas and Josephine Aftanas plans to
use hers for her daughter's May wedding.
   Many of the 4,500 Livonia Transmission plant employees already
had plans for their portion of the $635 million in profit-sharing
checks that Ford distributed Tuesday to 156,479 U.S. workers.
   Ford earned an industry-record $4.6 billion in 1987 and
distributions to workers jumped by 70 percent to an average of more
than $3,700, up from $2,100 in 1986 when Ford earned a
company-record $3.29 billion.
   Most Ford workers received their checks Tuesday morning. But
Peabody and his colleagues on the main transmission assembly line
at the Livonia plant agreed to wait until Ford Vice Chairman Harold
Poling arrived for a Tuesday afternoon ceremony.
   ``It's not only the politicians who can call this Super
Tuesday,'' Poling told a crowd of cheering workers. He noted that
the plant's 4,500 employees received $17.6 million, or an average
of $4,450 each.
   ``You helped make 1987 one of the most remarkable years _ and
certainly the most profitable _ in the history of Ford Motor Co.,''
Poling said before he and a retinue of reporters and executives
walked to the assembly line.
   The Livonia Transmission workers' checks were larger than the
company average because most workers have high seniority and few
new, younger workers have been hired there, said Ford Vice
President Peter Pestillo.
   Workers on that line assemble transmissions for
front-wheel-drive cars such as the popular Taurus-Sable and the new
Lincoln Continental.
   Most of them said they are lucky to be there at all. Most were
on layoff from other plants and had enough seniority to be called
to work at Livonia when Ford added the line three years ago.
   Ford withheld the checks of about 2,244 workers under a court
order for payment of delinquent child support. All but 50 of those
workers live in Michigan. The others live in Jefferson County, Ky.,
Ford spokesman Mike Moran said.
   More than 160,250 Ford workers in the United States received
profit-sharing checks in 1986. Ford workers took home an average
$2,100 in profit-sharing for 1985, $2,000 for 1984 and $400 for
1983, when the company distributed the first checks.
   General Motors Corp. workers received no share of GM's $3.56
billion in 1987 profits, though the corporation said it would
distribute $184.6 million in stock bonuses to executives.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, switched to the Ford
profit-sharing formula for 1988, but said that formula would have
generated no profit-sharing distributions had it been used for 1987.

   Procter & Gamble Co. has entered a joint
venture with Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif., increasing the
Cincinnati-based consumer products company's involvement in the
pharmaceutical industry.
   The companies will work to bring Naprosyn, Syntex's popular
prescription arthritis treatment, to the over-the-counter market.
   P&G officials have joined Syntex's talks with the Food and Drug
Administration concerning wider distribution of Naprosyn, Kathleen
Gary, Syntex vice president of public affairs, said Tuesday.
   Once the venture is under way, Syntex will benefit from P&G's
expertise in marketing over-the-counter drugs, she said.
   Syntex and P&G have indicated their work on Naprosyn would be
the first of several joint projects. The companies said they are
``engaged in a series of other broad ranging discussions regarding
further collaboration.''
   Neither P&G representative Pam Sussman nor Ms. Gary could
provide details on what kind of ventures the companies might be
planning.
   Naprosyn and a related product called Anaprox are Syntex's
biggest sellers, accounting for more than half of its $1.3 billion
in annual sales. Naprosyn is sold in more than 80 countries.

<HEAD>Whirlpool Blasts GE `Interference' In Roper Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roper Corp. says it will meet with
General Electric Co. to discuss an unsolicited $423 million
takeover offer despite a pending merger agreement with Whirlpool
Corp.
   The Augusta, Ga.-based company maintained Tuesday that its
earlier agreement with Whirlpool didn't preclude meetings with GE.
Roper said it would advise shareholders about its stance on the GE
offer by March 18.
   Whirlpool, meanwhile accused GE of ``deliberate and heavy-handed
interference'' in its efforts to acquire Roper, which manufactures
some of the gas and electric ranges currently marketed by GE.
   GE on Monday bid $45 a share, or $423 million, to acquire 9.4
million outstanding shares of Roper stock. The offer came a week
after announcement of a definitive agreement under which Whirlpool
would pay $37.50 a share, or $350 million, for outstanding Roper
stock.
   GE's tender offer for Roper expires April 1; Whirlpool's expires
March 25.
   The prior agreement ``remains in the best interest of
shareholders, customers and employees of both companies and ...
Whirlpool remains firmly committed to effecting the agreed-upon
transaction,'' Benton Harbor-based Whirlpool said in a statement
released in Detroit.
   The statement said Whirlpool officials were ``considering a full
range of options to complete the transaction.'' It did not specify
how the GE bid would be countered but noted that Roper directors
unanimously approved the agreement with Whirlpool.
   Whirlpool was ``deeply disturbed by GE's deliberate and
heavy-handed interference with its definitive merger agreement with
Roper,'' the statement said.
   Whirlpool officials also were concerned ``that GE's offer was
inspired by a fear of the increased competition a Whirlpool-Roper
combination would bring, especially for GE's Hotpoint brand,'' the
statement said.
   Calls to GE headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., were unanswered
late Tuesday. GE said it made the offer after learning from a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Roper agreed to the
Whirlpool merger under the threat of a unilateral takeover.

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Wednesday called upon the U.S. Congress to recognize Europe's
contribution to liberalizing world trade and refrain from
protectionist legislation.
   In a speech to the European Parliament, Kohl said the European
Economic Community's recent decisions to cut back farm production
set an example for Washington to follow.
   ``We are confident the Congress will understand our measures and
therefore should refrain from all protectionist legislation,'' he
said.
   Kohl referred to a decision by the leaders of the 12-nation EEC
last month to cut spending on agricultural subsidies as a means of
curbing the production of food Europe can neither consume nor sell.
   Speaking as the current EEC president, Kohl hailed the Feb. 13
decision of the Brussels summit as a turning point in the EEC's
31-year history.
   He also outlined to the Parliament a long list of measures his
government plans to push through before the end of its EEC
presidency on June 30. Among them were plans for complete
liberalization of capital movements, opening of the insurance and
financial services to international competition and harmonization
of technical standards.
   ``The internal market will develop only if we coordinate our
economic, financial and monetary policies,'' Kohl said.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Wednesday called the creation of a European central bank an
``absolute necessity.''
   But he told the European Parliament that fusing the monetary
policies of the 12 European Economic Community nations must be
``gradual, step by step.''
   Kohl's backing of an EEC central bank was more cautious than
that of his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genshcer, who last
month called for the creation of an experts group to see how such a
central bank could be formed.
   Genscher suggested the experts be named by the next EEC summit
in June with the mandate of drafting within a year the statutes of
an EEC central bank.
   EEC business leaders also have called for the creation of a
European central bank.

<TEXT>
   A major Japanese trading firm and an agricultural
group that imports about 40 percent of the nation's feed grain will
jointly purchase a U.S. grain company, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The National Federation of Agricultural Cooperative
Associations, or Zennoh, and C. Itoh Co., one of Japan's three
largest trading houses, are completing an agreement to buy
Consolidated Grain and Barge of St. Louis, Missouri, said a C. Itoh
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said final details, including the purchase price
and the share of investment by each party, would be worked out by
the end of April.
   A Zennoh official said his organization planned to link its New
Orleans-based export arm, the Zennoh Grain Center, with
Consolidated Grain, which handles 3.3 million tons of corn and
750,000 tons of soybeans a year.
   Consolidated Grain, which operates primarily in Ohio, Illinois,
Missouri and Iowa, controls 30 grain silos and 650 barges used to
transport grain.
   The Zennoh official, who also insisted on anonymity, denied a
report in the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun that Zennoh would
use the company to apply pressure on grain-growing regions where
farmers are pushing for an end to Japan's restrictions on beef and
citrus fruit imports.
   Zennoh, which handles almost 40 percent of the 1.5 million tons
of feed grain imported annually into Japan, has condemned U.S.
demands for an end to the quotas.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will try to cut costs in a new
contract with the United Auto Workers union, while the UAW will
push for improved job security and profit-sharing, negotiators for
both sides say.
   Among the top items on the No. 3 automaker's negotiating agenda
are more employee-management programs. The UAW also will demand a
halt to layoffs unless there is a sales slump.
   The company has offered an early start to negotiations this
year, when a three-year contract with the UAW expires. The union's
190-member Chrysler Council is to meet Thursday and may decide
whether to accept the company's offer.
   The Chrysler-UAW contract, which covers 71,700 workers, expires
Sept. 14.
   UAW Vice President Marc Stepp, who heads the union's Chrysler
Department, said the union will demand that profit-sharing be based
on annual earnings, as it is at Ford Motor Co. On Tuesday, Ford
distributed profit-sharing checks averaging $3,700 apiece to its
unionized employees.
   Stepp also said the union was seeking job-protection language
similar to UAW contracts at Ford and General Motors Corp. Those
three-year contracts, negotiated last year, forbid layoffs unless
there is a sales slump, put stronger restrictions on work performed
outside the company and a 3 percent general wage increase in the
first year and lump sum payments in the following two years.
   ``We won't take anything less than GM and Ford,'' Stepp said.

   General Motors Corp. spent 25 percent more on its
television advertising in 1987 than it did in the previous year,
ranking it as the top advertiser among automakers, a survey shows.
   GM spent $500 million on television ads last year, the largest
chunk of the $2 billion car makers spent on the medium, according
to a survey reported Tuesday by the Television Bureau of
Advertising.
   The 1987 total figure was 19 percent more than in 1986.
   GM spokesman Harold Jackson said the automaker's increase came
because of ``aggressive promotion of new GM models in a highly
competitive market.''
   Ford Motor Co. ranked second, spending $304 million, and
Chrysler Corp. was third at $265 million. Toyota Motor Sales led
foreign car makers, spending $167 million last year.
   The largest increase in advertising came from Suzuki Motor Co.,
which boosted its television costs by 126.3 percent, from $12
million in 1986 to $28 million last year. The largest decline was
at Volkswagen of America, which spent 9.4 percent less last year
than the year before.
   The figures represent annual network and spot television
spending for the automakers and dealer associations, according to
William Moll, president of the television advertising bureau.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS final 5 grafs with 8 grafs to update with Macy SEC
filing, stock price.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. has taken its battle for
Federated Department Stores Inc. to the marketplace and to the
courts.
   Macy, which last week agreed to a $6.1 billion buyout of
Federated, on Tuesday began a tender offer for 80 percent of the
Cincinnati-based retailer's common stock.
   Macy also asked a federal court for an injunction to block the
rival $6.18 billion buyout offer from Campeau Corp., contending
Campeau's bid _ which was revised from an earlier offer _ actually
constituted a new offer and as such must remain open beyond its
scheduled expiration at midnight EST March 15.
   Extending Campeau's bid would reduce the pressure on Federated
shareholders to decide between the rival Macy and Campeau offers,
effectively putting the Macy offer _ which expires April 4 _ on
more equal footing.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based real estate developer and retailer, is
offering $75 in cash per share for 80 percent of Federated's stock
and $44 in cash per share for the remaining 20 percent. The Campeau
bid, which has an aggregate value of $68 per share, totals $6.18
billion.
   Until March 2, when Campeau officially announced its two-tier
bid, the company had offered $68 in cash outright for each of
Federated's 89.6 million outstanding shares.
   ``In order to increase the pressure on Federate's stockholders,
defendants have unlawfully treated their new two-tier offer as a
`mere' amendment to their prior tender offer,'' Macy contended in
court papers.
   Because of the two-stage price structure, Campeau's latest
proposal bears little resemblance to its original bid and should
therefore be treated as a new offer, Macy argued.
   Under federal law, a new offer would have to remain open for at
least 20 business days after publication or submission to
stockholders. If Campeau's bid is considered a new offer, it could
not legally expire on March 15 as scheduled.
   Macy asked the court to block the Campeau offer from closing
before stockholders had a sufficient amount of time to review
materials and to evaluate the changes included in the new bid.
   Macy's tender offer will pay $74.50 per share in cash for up to
70.43 million shares, or approximately 80 percent of Federated
common stock. Macy plans to swap shares in a new company,
Macy's-Federated Inc., for the remaining 20 percent of Federated's
shares.
   The Macy offer expires at midnight EST April 4. Analysts
estimate it is worth $6.1 billion.
   Macy revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission Tuesday that under the Macy-Federated agreement,
Federated executives have the option of being paid in cash for all
of their shares in the company, instead of the cash-and-stock offer
being made to the public. The price to be paid for the executives'
stock was $73.80 per share, slightly less than the cash price in
the tender offer.
   Federated stock was up 37{ cents to $66.37{ a share in early New
York Stock Exchange trading today.
   In a separate SEC filing Monday detailing its latest bid,
Campeau revealed that Federated had received six offers for its
Ralphs supermarkets division in California. The bids ranged from
$800 million to $990 million, including a $955 million offer by
Ralphs management, Campeau said.
   Macy also said in its SEC filing that it expected Ralphs to be
sold.
   Whoever ends up acquiring Federated is also likely to sell the
company's other non-department store divisions, Gold Circle
discount stores and Main Street and Children's Place specialty
stores.
   Campeau announced last week it had agreed to sell Federated's
Foley's and Filene's department store divisions to the May
Department Stores Co. if its tender offer succeeded.
   Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, also owns
department stores including Bloomingdale's, Lazarus, Rich's,
Abraham & Straus, Bullock's and Burdine's.
   In its SEC filing, Macy said it expected some department store
divisions would be sold, but it did not elaborate. Analysts expect
Macy, which has nearly 100 department and specialty stores of its
own, to sell Federated Rich's and Abraham & Straus divisions.

<HEAD>Belgian Government Seeking Anti-Takeover Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is trying to push
legislation through the Belgian Parliament to control corporate
raiders in the wake of the takeover battle for Societe Generale de
Belgique SA, officials said Wednesday.
   The law would make it mandatory for an investor to disclose a
shareholding in a publicly-listed Belgian company once the stake
reaches 10 percent of the total voting stock. Further disclosures
would be required for each increment of 5 percent.
   If approved, the law would be effective from March 1, 1988
through Dec. 31, 1989 and would apply to Belgian companies with a
minimum equity of 200 million francs, the equivalent of $5.71
million.
   The bill will be examined by a committee on Thursday and be put
to a parliamentary vote next week, Marc De Backer, a Finance
Ministry spokesman, said.
   The absence in Belgium of legislation to control raiders allowed
the Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti to build up a direct and
indirect stake of 18.6 percent in Societe Generale before
announcing his bid on Jan. 18 for effective control of the firm,
which is Belgium's largest holding company.
   In the ensuing battle, the other major Societe Generale
shareholder, Cie. Financiere de Suez of France, bought its stake of
20 percent in similar secrecy.

   The stock market edged upward today, struggling
to extend Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 24.70 on Tuesday,
gained .66 to 2,081.73 by 11 a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 788 up, 528 down and
461 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 72.23 million shares at
midmorning.
   Confidence has continued to spread lately on Wall Street that
the economy remains healthy nearly five months after Black Monday
on Oct. 19.
   In addition, stock prices have been less volatile lately than
they were as recently as early January, suggesting that investors'
mood is less subject to sudden change.
   Analysts say investing institutions have grown more eager to put
some of their cash reserves into stocks, in order to show in their
first-quarter reports to clients that they participated in the
recent market rally.
   Still, many observers wonder how much stock might be for sale at
higher prices by investors sitting with paper losses and waiting
for an opportune time to get out of the market.
   Japanese stocks were mostly higher following an up day in the
Tokyo market. Matsushita Electrical climbed 4} to 200{ and Honda
Motor gained 2~ to 129~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.31 to 151.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.65 at 297.69.

   C. Robert Powell ought to be taking orders from
Tokyo. Last year, the 60-year-old chief executive became one of the
first Americans to see his company seized by the Japanese in a
hostile takeover.
   So why is Powell still telling his Japanese bosses how he
intends to run things at Reichhold Chemicals Inc.? Simple, he says.
He knows the American market and they don't.
   ``In Japan they have `harmony': a closed industry; you don't cut
prices. I told them `harmony' in the U.S. is six years in
Leavenworth.''
   More than 3 million Americans work for businesses that have at
least 10 percent foreign ownership, and their numbers are rising
rapidly as foreigners snap up U.S. properties with the dollars
earned from their huge trading surpluses.
   The bosses include Italians in Indiana, Swedes in Georgia,
Canadians in Vermont and West Germans in California. The businesses
range from cars to cement.
   But people like Robert Powell in White Plains, N.Y., prove that
working for a foreign boss doesn't necessarily mean giving up the
American way of life.
   After one tough discussion with a superior from Dainippon Ink
and Chemicals Inc., Powell says he was told by a lower-level
Japanese, ``Mr. Maeda doesn't like to argue with you.''
   ``I said, `Fine, tell him not to argue with me.'''
   Foreign companies such as Dainippon are learning to adapt to
American ways, a lesson in flexibility learned years ago by U.S.
companies such as International Business Machines Corp. when they
went global.
   ``We're really babies at working with each other,'' said
Clifford Clarke, president of IRI International Inc. in Redwood
City, Calif., a consulting firm specializing in U.S.-Japanese
management issues.
   The first step in a corporate relationship is denial of
differences. The second step is ``throwing names at each other.''
The third step is understanding, and the final step is taking
advantage of the differences, Clarke said.
   ``Out of the diversity comes the best decisions,'' Clarke said.
``That's as American as apple pie.''
   Fretting about foreign bosses seems to be more common among
people who don't have them _ presidential candidates, for example _
than people who do have them, such as Wayne Hancock, who works for
a Bridgestone Corp. tire plant in La Vergne, Tenn.
   ``It's been real enjoyable working with the Japanese,'' Hancock,
an accounting manager, said recently. ``It's not like an American
company. There's a lot more emphasis here on the quality of the
product. ... They're more people-oriented.''
   Bridgestone's relations with the union are so good that the
United Rubber Workers flag flies next to the Bridgestone flag in La
Vergne.
   Some problems do arise when the boss lives in another country.
Differences in language and culture can inhibit communication, and
there are ceilings at some companies on how high Americans can
advance.
   In Barre, Vt., David Cuttler was worried that his way up at
Quebec-based Bombardier Inc. was blocked by his trouble learning
French. Now his worries have eased.
   ``After you work together for a while, you tend not even to
distinguish Americans and Canadians. You're all part of the same
team,'' said Cuttler, production manager for a factory that builds
train cars. ``It's nice to speak French, but it's not necessary.''
   The leading states for foreign employers are California, New
York, Texas, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to 1985 figures
that are the most recent available.
   Japanese employers get most of the publicity even though they
ranked only fifth in U.S. employment in 1985, behind British,
Canadians, West Germans and Dutch.
   Japanese ranked far ahead of British, West Germans and Arabs in
a poll asking which were the best U.S. employers. The poll was
released this past week by Smick-Medley & Associates Inc., a
Washington-based consulting firm.
   One reason for Japan's high profile _ think of the movie ``Gung
Ho'' _ is that Japanese are likely to mold companies in their own
image. Europeans often remain at arm's length from their U.S.
holdings.
   Italian executives of Ferruzzi Group have paid only two visits
to the Fort Wayne, Ind., headquarters of food processor Central
Soya Inc. since buying the company last year. And that suits David
Swanson just fine.
   ``It would be foolish of Americans to try to implant certain of
their systems on Europeans _ and vice versa,'' said Swanson,
Central Soya's president and chief executive.
   Europeans are not always so invisible: West Germany's BASF AG
has had labor problems in West Virginia, Michigan, New York and New
Jersey, and chemical workers in Geismar, La., are just now
trickling back to work after a company lockout that began in 1984.
   BASF says its labor policies in the United States are set
locally, but the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union charges
that the decisions are made in Ludwigshafen.
   ``In West Germany, it's illegal to lock your employees out. What
they've been able to do here they would not have been able to do in
their own country,'' said Ernest Rousselle, a union representative.
   Both Europeans and Japanese have elaborate employment guarantees
at home _ the Europeans by law, the Japanese more by tradition.
Americans sometimes feel cheated when the companies are not as
protective when they do business in the United States.
   More than 130 people in the San Diego area sued Japan's Kyocera
International Inc. after they were laid off in 1980, claiming they
had been promised lifetime employment. They lost but have appealed.
   More typical are complaints from ambitious American executives
that their road to the top has been blocked, such as the pending
lawsuit by Thomas McDannold and Edward Neubauer against NEC America
Inc. in Mountain View, Calif.
   Potential for cultural conflict is probably greatest on Wall
Street, where buttoned-down Japanese managers try to deal with
freewheeling American recruits, and vice versa.
   ``You need a kind of cowboy mentality,'' said Gregory V.
Coggiano, an executive with Nomura Securities International Inc.,
``but you've got to be a team player as well.''
   A consensus is developing among management experts that foreign
owners would be wise to adapt their homegrown methods to the ways
of Americans. At Bridgestone, for example, Japanese stopped doing
early-morning exercises in the parking lot when only a few
Americans joined in.
   The result, as Bridgestone's human resources adviser Seiji Ohtsu
describes it, may be a ``third approach'' _ a blending of good
ideas, foreign and domestic.
   As such things as quality circles and flexible job
classifications become standard operating procedure here, having a
foreign boss may no longer seem quite so unusual.
   In Japan's case, said labor analyst Harley Shaiken of the
University of California at San Diego, ``The real, key issue isn't
so much how Japanese companies are different, it's the enormous
influence they have had on U.S. firms.''

   It is a place few Americans ever see, a plush
lounge where Japanese executives spend $100 an evening to sip
whiskey, flirt with pretty hostesses and maybe take a turn singing
to the accompaniment of a baby grand piano.
   The piano bar _ ``pianoba'' in Japanese _ is the one place where
Japanese executives lower their reserve, speak frankly and
consolidate working relationships with their colleagues and
customers.
   ``In the office, nothing moves. In the piano bar, everything
moves,'' a Japanese executive said late into a recent Friday
evening at one club in midtown Manhattan.
   Americans other than ethnic Japanese are generally not welcome
at a piano bar unless they are in the company of Japanese. Piano
bars do not advertise. The only way to get in is to know where one
is _ and then to be able to read the message in Japanese on a small
piece of paper telling customers to ring three times for admittance.
   Americans are accustomed to being the outsiders when they go to
Japan to do business. But at a piano bar, Americans are outsiders
in the middle of New York City.
   ``If you're not invited, you're being cut out of something,''
said a young American who speaks Japanese, works for a Japanese
trading company and occasionally goes to piano bars.
   ``More business is done after 5 o'clock in these bars than is
done during business hours. Because that's when people can have a
couple of drinks and really say what's on their minds,'' the
American said, speaking on condition that he not be identified.
   The piano bar does not start to fill up until after 9 p.m. or
so, when executives drift over after work and dinner. The $100 does
not pay for food, except for light snacks. It doesn't even cover
drinks: Regulars have bottles of expensive scotch kept for them in
a closet.
   The $100 does cover the attentions of the hostesses, young women
who sit on stools and light guests' cigarettes, freshen their
drinks and engage in flirtatious small talk. Most are from Japan or
elsewhere in the Far East; others are Americans or Europeans.
   Lest the guests become too bored or too bold, the hostesses are
shuttled from table to table by the mama-san, who is dressed in a
traditional kimono.
   When their names are called out, men stride up to the microphone
and sing the song of their choice, usually in Japanese. Among songs
in English, a favorite is ``My Way,'' a la Frank Sinatra.
   The importance of the piano bar to Japanese business should not
be underestimated, said Clifford Clarke, president of IRI
International Inc., a Redwood City, Calif-based consulting firm
specializing in U.S.-Japanese management issues.
   While Americans prize achievement above all, Japanese give the
most weight to personal relationships, which are forged in piano
bars and their less-expensive cousins, the karaoke bars, Clarke
said.
   ``We talk about after 5 in the bars as being social. They don't
separate private life and work life,'' Clarke said. ``It's not felt
that after-hours time is play time.
   ``A lot of Americans feel that Japanese never give direct
feedback. Well, that's what the evenings are for,'' he said.

<HEAD>Battered Mexican Oil Giant Celebrates 50th Birthday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Weakened by corruption and low prices,
Mexico's giant Pemex petroleum monopoly has been trying to cut
costs and raise productivity as it struggles to stay afloat in a
world glutted with cheap oil.
   But experts say the effort by President Miguel de la Madrid's
administration has not made much headway, even though the
well-being of Pemex is vital to this debt-ridden country of 84
million people.
   ``Two of the main obstacles to raising productivity have been
corruption and a very powerful union that has been against trimming
an overblown work force,'' said one expert on the Mexican oil
industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Nevertheless, Pemex ``is enormously important'' to Mexico both
as ``a major source of foreign exchange, and the country's largest
tax payer,'' said oil expert George W. Grayson in a telephone
interview from Richmond, Va.
   The taxes and royalties Pemex paid last year made up half the
federal government's revenues as it struggled through the nation's
sixth year of economic crisis. But the petroleum products it sold
abroad accounted for 39.6 percent of the country's 1987 export
earnings, down from 79 percent in 1982 when the oil industry was
booming here.
   Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., as it is known by its formal name,
monopolizes everything from exploring and drilling to heavy
petrochemicals, transportation and wholesaling. Only the gas
stations, which carry its logo, are privately owned concessions.
   It was created by President Lazaro Cardenas, an army general,
through an executive order issued March 18, 1938, a few days after
he expropriated 17 foreign companies.
   International financial circles did not expect Pemex to live
long because it lacked money, skills and technology.
   Half a century later, Pemex is celebrating its 50th anniversary
as one of the world's biggest integrated petroleum companies and a
national institution a majority of Mexicans take pride in.
   The big bonanza came when Jose Lopez Portillo, the son of a
Pemex engineer, became president in late 1976, shortly after a new
generation of Pemex geologists and engineers trained in modern
techniques, located fields in the southeast that turned out to be
about twice the size of Alaska's North Slope in Prudhoe Bay.
   With half the world starved for petroleum because of high
prices, Arab embargoes, and later erratic deliveries caused by the
outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, the young technocrats at Pemex
scrambled to find and develop even more sources of new oil.
   Pemex has sole rights over all hydrocarbons in Mexico's 761,604
square miles of national territory (three times the size of Texas)
and over the 200-mile offshore belt on both coasts that Mexico
claims as an exclusive economic zone.
   As a result, the country's proven oil reserves of 48 billion
barrels in 1987 _ almost twice as big as those of the United States
_ remain the world's fifth largest after Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
Soviet Union and Venezuela.
   But much of that oil lies inside tightly packed rock formations,
making it too expensive to pump out at today's depressed prices.
Reserves are down by an estimated 2 percent from three years ago,
because exploration has not kept pace with production.
   Exploration was restricted after the government cut Pemex's
budget by 8 percent last year, along with almost everything except
a few priority projects, because of the country's economic crunch.
   The bust came during the last months of Lopez Portillo's
six-year term, when North Sea, Alaskan and other non-OPEC oilfields
started to flood world markets and traditional producers began
slashing prices to hold on to their clients.
   At the height of the oil boom from December 1980 to May 1981,
Pemex light-grade Isthmus crude sold at $38.50 a barrel. As of this
January, Isthmus crude had dropped to an average of $15.03 a
barrel. February prices have not yet been released.
   Aside from the price slide, the company also continues to battle
corruption, much of it centering around the Oil Workers Union,
which represents 95 percent of Pemex's 183,000 workers and
employees.
   De la Madrid, who inherited these problems along with a giant
foreign debt now estimated at $105 billion and few resources to
meet payments on it, launched a ``moral renovation'' campaign at
the beginning of his administration and appointed Mario Ramon
Beteta, a veteran economist, as head of Pemex.
   Beteta riled the union by trying to crack down on corruption,
cutting costs and pork-barrel contracts to union companies. By law,
5 percent of the value of all Pemex contracts used to go to the
union, which owns a host of service companies, from drilling to
pumping and construction. Beteta cut that to 2 percent, also
mandating that the contracts be awarded through open bidding.
   Francisco Rojas, who succeeded Beteta last year, replaced four
of Pemex's seven deputy directors and laid off 900 non-union
employees, but the fight against corruption continues. Industry
sources say the union still wields considerable power and maintains
the inside track on most contract work.
   To hold down costs, Pemex has concentrated on developing the
``gusher'' fields on- and off-shore in the southeastern part of the
Gulf of Mexico, where the oil is cheapest to produce.
   Export revenues are down from an annual high of $16.4 billion in
1982-84, to a low of $6.1 billion in 1986 and $8.5 billion last
year. Production has dropped from an average of 2.65 million
barrels a day, then, to 2.40 million in 1986 and 2.60 million last
year.
   About half of Pemex's production is used domestically, supplying
an estimated 90 percent of Mexico's energy needs.
   Roughly a quarter more is exported to the United States. The
rest goes mostly to Japan, Spain, France, Israel and Central
America.
   Mexico has consistently tried to project a conservative and
independent image as a world exporter. It refuses to join the
Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries, even though it has
reluctantly cooperated at times with the 13-nation cartel in
reducing export volumes to buttress prices.
   As a matter of policy, it also refuses to sell more than 50
percent of its exports to any single country.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures opened higher but quickly turned lower in
response to reduced spot market prices for soybeans, soybean oil
and soybean meal, analysts said.
   Wheat futures opened lower on follow-through selling from
Tuesday but soon turned higher as the reduced prices brought in
buyers.
   Wheat futures prices have been trending lower recently due to
uncertainty about future U.S. export sales, especially large
shipments under the government's Export Enhancement Program,
analysts said.
   ``We've got some business but we're in need of some new EEP
business,'' said Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Corn futures weakened on increased farmer selling, Gustafson
said. But Algeria and South Korea both had purchase bids pending,
and sales of U.S. corn to those countries could boost corn futures,
he said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3 a bushel; corn was 1\ cent
lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.00\ a bushel; oats were \
cent to } cent lower with March at $1.91} a bushel; soybeans were {
cent to 2{ cents lower with March at $6.14{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .15 cent higher with April at
72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with March at 81.05 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent lower
to .03 cent higher with April at 43.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent to .77 cent lower with March at 53.32 cents a

   Cattle and hog futures closed higher Tuesday while frozen pork
belly futures retreated.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
Tuesday's rally despite some early resistance from sellers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 24.70 on Tuesday,
gained 3.64 to 2,084.71 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally

444 unchanged.
   Confidence has continued to spread lately on Wall Street that
the economy remains healthy nearly five months after Black Monday
on Oct. 19.
   In addition, stock prices have been less volatile lately than
they were as recently as early January, suggesting that investors'
mood is less subject to sudden change.
   Analysts say investing institutions have grown more eager to put
some of their cash reserves into stocks, in order to show in their
first-quarter reports to clients that they participated in the
recent market rally.
   Still, many observers wonder how much stock might be for sale at
higher prices by investors sitting with paper losses and waiting
for an opportune time to get out of the market.
   Japanese stocks were mostly higher following an up day in the
Tokyo market. Matsushita Electrical climbed 5 to 200} and Honda
Motor gained 2~ to 129~.
   Johnson & Johnson added 2} to 86\. Analysts said the buying was
prompted by renewed enthusiasm over sales prospects for a J&J skin
treatment product that has received considerable publicity of late.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.59 to 152.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   Grumman Corp. today announced that it will
lay off about 700 employees and eliminate another 1,900 jobs due to
declining business in aircraft engineering and manufacturing.
   In an open letter to employees, Grumman President John O'Brien
said the reductions were prompted by the loss of a recent
competition for a new aircraft program, production delays caused by
defense budget reductions, and uncertainty about the funding of the
A-6 aircraft.
   However, O'Brien said, ``The airplane business is the backbone
of our company, and we're in it to stay.'' He said the company was
investing millions of dollars in research for future aircraft.
   Six hundred employees will lose their jobs at the Aircraft
Systems, Aerostructures, Data Systems and Electronics Systems
divisions on Long Island, N.Y.; another 100 layoffs are planned for
Aircraft Systems facilities in Milledgeville, Ga., and Stuart,
Fla., and the Systems Division in Melbourne, Fla.
   An additional 1,900 jobs will eliminated nationally through
attrition, coupled with a reduction in part-time and temporary
workers, the company said.
   The largest part of the layoff will occur by the middle of
April, with the remainder spread over the remaining months of the
year, Grumman said.
   Grumman said hiring has already been sharply curtailed and is
now essentially limited to people with specialized skills.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Falls Sharply In 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction plunged 14 percent in 1987
from the previous year as rising interest rates and high apartment
vacancies took their toll on the industry, a survey released
Wednesday showed.
   The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information
Systems Co. said nationwide housing starts fell to 1.58 million
units from 1.84 million units in 1986.
   It noted that only three of the nation's top 10 metropolitan
areas _ Washington, D.C., Detroit and Philadelphia _ showed any
pickup in construction activity last year.
   ``High vacancy rates and high mortgage rates took a heavy toll
of apartment and one-family building alike last year,'' said George
A. Christie, chief economist for F.W. Dodge.
   Christie said the apartment surplus, which he describes as ``a
hangover from early '80's tax shelters,'' was likely to persist
this year but that a drop in interest rates after the Oct. 19 stock
market crash has improved the outlook for construction of
single-family homes.
   Leading the nation in 1987 housing construction was Washington,
with 52,045 units, up 1 percent from 1986. The Los Angeles-Long
Beach area ranked second with 50,052 units, although activity
decreased 32 percent from the previous year.
   The rest of the nation's top 10 housing areas for 1987 were:
Atlanta, 46,333 units, down 12 percent; Riverside-San Bernadino,
Calif., 41,282, down 20 percent; Chicago, 30,189, down 6 percent;
Phoenix, Ariz., 27,216, down 37 percent; San Diego, Calif., 27,011,
down 34 percent; Minneapolis-St. Paul, 26,219, down 5 percent;
Detroit, 26,009, up 1 percent; and Philadelphia, 25,366, up 1
percent.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 24.70 on Tuesday,
slipped back 1.16 to 2,079.91 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally

the economy remains healthy nearly five months after Black Monday
on Oct. 19.
   In addition, stock prices have been less volatile lately than
they were as recently as early January, suggesting that investors'
mood is less subject to sudden change.
   Analysts say investing institutions have grown more eager to put
some of their cash reserves into stocks, in order to show in their
first-quarter reports to clients that they participated in the
recent market rally.
   Still, many observers wonder how much stock might be for sale at

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp., striving to show its commitment to
standards in the computer industry, announced technology agreements
Wednesday with American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Sun
Microsystems Inc.
   Unisys said the agreements would bolster its use of Unix, a
computer operating system or ``traffic cop'' that was developed by
AT&T and is gaining popularity among commercial computer users.
   In addition to working with AT&T to enhance Unix, Unisys said it
was licensing a computer chip design from Sun Microsystems, known
as Sparc, that would be used in future Unisys computers running
Unix.
   Unisys, the world's third-largest computer company, said its
strong support for Unix set it apart from its two larger rivals,
International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.
   The company said its business based on Unix doubled last year
and amounts to more than $500 million a year.
   ``There's no doubt by now that Unix is going to be a very
sizable portion of the information systems industry,'' Jan
Lindelow, Unisys senior vice president for corporate marketing and
services, said in an interview.

   Soybean futures prices fell sharply in light
trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain futures also
ended lower.
   The soybean selloff was led by speculators and commission houses
in reaction to lower cash prices for soybean meal and soybean oil,
analysts said.
   The losses were exaggerated by the thin trade, said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``It wasn't a very heavy trading day in terms of volume,'' he
said.
   Weaker cash prices also weighed on the corn market while wheat
futures declined on profit-taking from the day's highs.
   Gustafson also noted some speculative position-taking in advance
of the Agriculture Department's monthly grain supply-and-demand
report, which was scheduled for release after the close.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.92 a bushel; corn was \ cent

<HEAD>Swedish Companies Discussing Takeover Worth $990 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stora AB, a forestry products company,
offered Wednesday to pay the equivalent of $990 million for Swedish
Match AB, the world's leading manufacturer of lighters and wooden
matches.
   The offer of 5.94 billion kronor was the biggest cash takeover
bid ever in Sweden, but was widely criticized as being far below
the value of Swedish Match, which also has major interests in home
interior and consumer products.
   Both companies are dominated by investment companies controlled
by the wealthy industrialist Wallenberg family. One group controls
85 percent of Swedish Match, and the other holds a major voting
holding in Stora, which has Peter Wallenberg, the family patriarch,
as its board chairman.
   A merger would create one of Sweden's largest companies, with
annual sales of 36 billion kronor, or about $6 billion, and more
than 55,000 employees.
   Analysts said Stora wants to diversify its paper, pulp and power
operations and improve its access to the European Economic
Community.
   Brian Knox, a Scandinavian specialist at Kleinwort Grievson, a
London brokerage, said the bid was far below the range of what
Swedish Match is worth.
   ``If Match were a London company, it would be putting up a
vigorous defense,'' he said. ``But because of the huge (Wallenberg)
position, there will be a tendency for people to just shut their
eyes and enjoy it.''
   Peter Wallenberg conceded after a news conference that the price
was disputed at meetings of the two companies' boards, but he said
it reflected a fair value for Swedish Match.
   Both companies released 1987 financial results Wednesday showing
strong gains in profit. Stora said its pre-tax profit climbed 39
percent to 2.57 billion kronor from 1.85 billion kronor the
preceding year. Swedish Match had a 26 percent rise in profit to
628 million kronor from 500 million.
   Swedish Match was taken over by the Wallenberg family, along
with several other companies, after financier Ivar Kreuger's empire
collapsed and he committed suicide in Paris in 1932. Swedish Match
had created a virtual monopoly in the market for wooden matches and
now also dominates in lighters.
   It later expanded into consumer products and housing products.
Its Tarkett group is the world's second largest producer of
flooring material.
   Analysts noted that Sweden's two other major forestry product
companies recently diversified their operations through
acquisitions. Svenska Cellulosa AB bought the French diaper company
Peaudouce, and Mo-Och Domsjoe AB acquired Holmens Bruk AB, a
Swedish newsprint producer.
   Hans Larsson, chief executive of Swedish Match, said adding the
financial strength of Stora would help in future acquisitions.
   ``We will now have a very rich parent company,'' he said.
``We'll be on the offensive now, as we have been.''
   Among Swedish Match's latest major recent acquisitions are the
$230 million purchase of Wilkinson Sword, a major British producer
of matches, shaving products and household goods, and the $190
million purchase of the West German flooring group Pegulan.
   Those acquisitions are part of what makes the company
attractive, because of the access they offer to the European
Economic Community, Peter Wallenberg said.
   Stora, like other Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish groups, is
eager to expand into the member countries of the trade bloc to
avoid being shut out in 1992 when a single internal market is
scheduled to be created. None of the three belongs to the group.

<HEAD>Chrysler Workers Support Early Talks But Questions Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union
could be meeting over a bargaining table as soon as next month if
140 local union leaders meeting here Thursday agree to a request
for early contract talks.
   Local union leaders said Wednesday they favor early talks and
UAW Vice President Marc Stepp has said ``the earlier the better,''
but one issue must be settled first: Will Chrysler also agree to an
early strike deadline?
   ``Our preference would be to actually start the clock ... a real
strike deadline as opposed to an artificial bargaining deadline,''
UAW spokesman Peter Laarman said.
   Chrysler's three-year national contract, which governs wages and
benefits for 71,700 workers, expires Sept. 14. Talks normally would
begin in July, but Chrysler asked for early talks last week.
   Chrysler made the request after it succumbed to UAW pressure and
decided against selling its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts
subsidiary. As an alternative, the company said it would close four
Acustar plants if it could not sell them in the next 18 months.
   Angry workers had threatened a series of plant-by-plant strikes
over local issues and had stopped cooperating in union-management
programs essential to improving quality and production efficiency.
   The No. 3 automaker doesn't appear willing to let the union set
a deadline before Sept. 14, after which workers could legally
strike the company if no settlement were reached, Laarman said.
   Chrysler's chief negotiator and vice president for human
resources, Anthony St. John, told The Detroit News on Tuesday that
the company doesn't want an early strike deadline, but the company
would not comment Wednesday.
   St. John and Stepp both were in Milwaukee on Wednesday for
negotiations on a plant closing agreement for 5,500 workers at the
former American Motors Corp. assembly and stamping plants in
Kenosha, Wis.
   Stepp has said he would recommend early talks when he meets
Thursday with the UAW's national Chrysler bargaining council, which
represents workers at 49 local unions. The council will make its
decision Thursday afternoon.
   Local union leaders said they would support early talks because
it would increase chances of protecting jobs and of ironing out
mounting difficulties in plant-level labor relations.
   ``I'm positive our membership would be 100 percent in favor of
that. As long as we're talking about jobs they would be more than
willing,'' said Fred O'Brien, an official with Local 1264 at
Chrysler's key Sterling Heights stamping plant.
   If talks begin early on the national contract, local unions
would follow suit on plant-level contracts, which govern working
conditions and other issues specific to them, Laarman said.
   Chrysler is expected to agree to the job-protecting pattern
contract established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp.
   Chrysler's contract lacks protections included in the GM and
Ford pacts and workers said they want to sign a similar contract as
soon as possible.
   The GM and Ford contracts forbid layoffs except when production
is cut because of slow sales, make it harder for the companies to
move production outside the company or country and forbid plant
closings that were not announced before talks started.
   O'Brien said going to the table early would limit the time
Chrysler has to announce further plant closings and make it easier
for the union to battle the possible closings of the four Acustar
plants.
   In addition, Chrysler already buys the largest percentage of
outside parts of any Big Three maker _ 70 percent compared with 30
percent at GM and about 50 percent at Ford.
   O'Brien said workers are anxious to sign a contract that keeps
Chrysler from moving more parts work to outside non-union ``scab
shops'' or ``we'll all be on welfare.''
   Chrysler also has no profit-sharing program. Stepp said last
week that he would particularly like to see the Ford profit-sharing
formula included in the Chrysler contract.
   Ford workers Tuesday received profit-sharing checks averaging
more than $3,700 from Ford's industry-record 1987 profits of $4.6
billion.

<HEAD>Announces 700 Layoffs, Nearly 2,000 Job Eliminations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHPAGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grumman Corp., wounded by defense cutbacks
and the failure to win a major aircraft contract, announced
Wednesday it would lay off 700 employees and eliminate 1,900 more
jobs this year.
   The reductions amount to 7.7 percent of Grumman's 33,700
employees. Of the 700 employees who will be laid off, 600 work on
Long Island. The others work at Grumman facilities in
Milledgeville, Ga., and Stuart and Melbourne, Fla.
   The other job reductions will be made by attrition, coupled with
a cut in the number of part-time and temporary workers. Officials
said 1,700 of those 1,900 jobs are located on Long Island.
   Grumman President John O'Brien, in a letter to employees
published Wednesday, said recent reverses forced the reductions.
   He cited production delays caused by cuts in the defense budget,
and questions about the status of the A-6 plane. Congress must
reconcile the budget, which calls for production of 12 advanced
A-6Fs, and a budget authorization, which calls for production of 11
of the old A-6E planes.
   He also noted that Grumman had lost a competition for a contract
to build the Navy's advanced tactical aircraft. The contract,
valued at more than $4 billion, was won by McDonnell Douglas Corp.
of St. Louis.
   O'Brien noted that other Grumman planes, like the F-14D, E-2C
and EA-6B, will remain in production, and ``we are continuing to
invest millions of dollars in the development of technologies for
future aircraft.''
   ``The airplane business is the backbone of our company, and
we're in it to stay,'' O'Brien insisted.
   Most of the layoffs will occur by the middle of April, with the
remainder spread over the remaining months of this year, the
company said.

<HEAD>Seeks $3 Billion Credit Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. has asked a federal
bankruptcy judge to authorize a credit agreement allowing the
company to borrow up to $3 billion to finance its reorganization
plan.
   The $3 billion is a vital part of the giant oil company's effort
to extricate itself from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and would be one of
the largest amounts ever made to a company emerging from that
process.
   Texaco sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 last
year to avoid liens stemming from a $10.3 billion award granted
rival Pennzoil after a Texas jury found Texaco had illegally
derailed Pennzoil's takeover of Getty Oil Co.
   After months of failed appeals and negotiations, a
reorganization plan was reached with Texaco under which Pennzoil
would get a cash settlement of $3 billion.
   In a financial disclosure statement filed earlier this year,
Texaco told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg it would need
$5.6 billion to fund the reorganization plan, of which $2.4 billion
would be cash on hand and $3.2 billion would be borrowed.
   According to papers filed in bankruptcy court Tuesday, 20 to 30
banks were involved in the negotiations for the loans.
   The loans would be made to Texaco, Texaco Refining and Marketing
Inc. and Texaco Overseas Holding Inc. and would be secured by
collateral.
   The papers said that the collateral could include the stock of
Texas Caltex Petroleum, Texaco CAnada, Deutsche Texaco AG, reserves
of oil and gas or other assets.
   The debt would be repaid within three years, with an initial
$1.5 billion payment occuring within 12 months, $500 million
payment on the second anniversary and the rest paid the following
year.
   If approved, the plan would become effect April 14.
   The rate of interest would decline as Texaco's credit rating
improved, the papers said.
   A hearing on the matter was set for March 22.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher Against Other Currencies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mostly higher against major
currencies on a technical rebound Wednesday, as world markets
remained transfixed by the surging British pound, analysts said.
   Gold prices were also higher. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid price of $436.15 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m.
EST, up from $435.70 late Tuesday.
   John McCarthy, a currency trader at Irving Trust, said the
dollar moved lower all day, but bounced back at the end of the
session as traders covered short positions.
   In a short sale, traders sell borrowed dollars in expectation of
``covering'' the transaction by replacing the dollars with others
bought at cheaper rates.
   Since last Friday, the dollar has lost 7{ cents against the
British pound, as sterling surged amid higher British interest
rates and a strengthening economy.
   Adding strength to the pound Tuesday was a remark by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher ruling out an early cut in interest
rates.
   Dan Holland, an analyst at Discount Corp., said sterling's rise
``threw a bit of confusion into the market,'' because it led
traders to wonder if Britain were going to stop helping the other
major industrial nations maintain currency stability.
   But he said those fears eased Wednesday after a remark by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Reagan administration
believed London remained ``fully committed'' to upholding that Dec.
22 agreement among the industrialized nations.
   In London, the British pound closed at $1.8460, more expensive
for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.8415. In New York, it cost
$1.8476 to buy one pound, more expensive than the $1.8426 of
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.08 Japanese yen, up from
127.80. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 128.00
yen. Later in New York, the dollar stood at 127.95 yen, up from
127.93 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
were: 1.6690 West German marks, up from 1.6674; 1.3791 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3770; 5.6530 French francs, up from 5.6482;
1,232.50 Italian lire, up from 1,231.00; 1.2537 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2538.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
were: 1.6685 West German marks, up from 1.6668; 1.3785 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3790; 5.6485 French francs, down from 5.6625;
1.8750 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8780; 1.231.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,234.00; 1.2532 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2524.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $436.20 a
troy ounce, up 90 cents from late Tuesday's $435.30.
   Earlier in London, it fell to a late bid price of $436.50 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's late $438.10. In Zurich, the late bid
price was $437.00, up from $436.50. In Hong Kong, gold closed at a
bid $438.01, up from $438.00.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.31 dollars a
troy ounce, down from $6.36. On the New York Comex, silver stood at
$6.298 a troy ounce, down from $6.36 Tuesday.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge As Supply Tightness Returns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices settled at the highest levels in three
weeks Wednesday on indications of tightening supplies and rising
demand.
   On other markets, precious metals were mixed; grain and soybean
futures sank; cattle futures were mixed while pork futures
retreated; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   Prices for future delivery of copper rose for the sixth time in
the last seven sessions on the Commodity Exchange in New York on
renewed concern over supplies and a better-than-expected economic
outlook, analysts said.
   Copper inventory levels tracked by the Comex and the London
Metal Exchange have fallen in recent weeks, reinforcing ideas that
the fundamental factors that caused copper prices to more than
double last year have returned to the market, said Bette
Raptopoulos, an analyst in New York for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   The Comex said Wednesday that its copper inventories had
declined by 927 tons to 13,715 tons, the third substantial decline
this week.
   ``For a long while (last year ) there was tightness in
supplies,'' said Ms. Raptopoulos. ``In the early part of this year,
the tightness seemed to recede. Now the market's getting back to
the reality of a tight-supply situation.''
   Copper settled 3.90 cents to 6.25 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.035 a pound.
   Gold advanced slightly while silver retreated a bit in quiet
trading on the Comex.
   Gold settled 90 cents to $1.70 higher with April at $437.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 5.1 cents lower with March at
$6.298 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply in light trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Grain futures also ended lower.
   The soybean selloff was led by speculators and commission houses
in reaction to lower cash prices for soybean meal and soybean oil,
analysts said.
   The losses were exaggerated by the thin trade, said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Weaker cash prices also weighed on the corn market while wheat
futures declined on profit-taking from the day's highs.
   Gustafson also noted some position-evening in advance of the
Agriculture Department's monthly grain supply-and-demand report,
which was issued after the close.
   The report estimated U.S. wheat stocks on May 31, the end of the
current wheat marketing year, would total about 1.28 billion
bushels. The estimate was unchanged from figures issued a month ago.
   The USDA estimated ending corn stocks as of Sept. 30 at 4.12
billion bushels, also unchanged from the previous estimate.
   But the agency revised upward its estimate for ending soybean
stocks as of Sept. 30, to 315 million bushels from 305 million.
   The report was expected to have little impact on futures prices,
analysts said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 5 cents lower with March at $2.94} a
bushel; corn was { cent to 2} cents lower with March at $1.98} a
bushel; oats were 5 cents to 7} cents lower with March at $1.84\ a
bushel; soybeans were 10{ cents to 12 cents lower with March at
$6.06\ a bushel.
   Frozen pork belly futures plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to a Tuesday report showing 4.2 million pounds
of bellies stored last week in the exchange's warehouses outside
Chicago.
   The number, about double what the market had expected, came at a
time of seasonal increases in hog slaughters, said Chuck Levitt, an
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Hog futures retreated on increased slaughters while the cattle
complex finished mixed on profit-taking after two days of solid
gains, he said.
   Live cattle settled .37 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April
at 72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .27
cent higher with March at 81.27 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent
to .82 cents lower with April at 43.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent to 1.80 cents lower with March at 52.20 cents
a pound.
   Crude oil prices edged upward listlessly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange while the refined products ended mixed, with
few developments to influence trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 10 cents
higher with April at $15.49 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to
.46 cent lower with April at 43.03 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .17 cent to .29 cent higher with April at 44 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .55 point higher at 269.65. The underlying
spot index closed .37 point lower at 269.06.

<HEAD>Wharton Study Says Women's Leadership Patterns Changing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 3rd graf by rewording to include men and women in
the responses; picks up 4th graf: Webber studied...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE OWEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women business students are more eager for
leadership positions than they were in the 1970s and men are more
likely to accept the change, a Wharton School study concludes.
   ``The improvement in relations between the sexes is dramatic,''
Ross A. Webber, management professor at the elite Pennsylvania
business school, wrote for the latest issue of Human Resources
Management journal of the University of Michigan business school.
   He acknowledged, however, that the improvement apparent from
responses about the roles of women in mixed-gender study groups may
be slightly suspect because of 1980s expectations about men's
attitudes toward women.
   Webber studied behavior of men and women business graduate
students at the Wharton and Columbia schools in group projects from
1969-75 and at Wharton from 1980-84.
   ``Women are much more likely to exercise leadership whether in
the majority or the minority; conflict levels have sharply declined
on predominantly female teams; and males appear to be much less
threatened when working with women,'' Webber wrote.
   ``Clearly significant social change has occurred during the 10
years separating the two investigations.''
   The study examined four-person study groups formed from 420
students in the 1969-75 period and 268 in the later period. Course
instructors gave neither leader designations nor instructions on
how to organize to perform assigned tasks.
   Of the 688 students overall, 120 were in groups of four males,
392 in groups of three males and one female, 164 in groups of three
females and one male and 12 in groups of four females.
   In the male-majority groups, 51 percent of the men claimed to be
leaders, compared with 13 percent of the women, in the earlier
sample. By the 1980s, the disparity disappeared, with 57 percent of
the men and 61 percent of the women claiming to be group leaders.
   Group members' ideas toward others also changed, with the
percentage of men being called leaders falling from 48 to 36, and
the percentage of women considered group leaders rising from 7 to
56.
   ``The results suggest that when working with women, men feel
less compelled to play the macho, dominating role,'' Webber said.
   Among women in female-majority groups, claims of being the
leader rose from 35 percent to 61 percent over the decade. In the
1970s, all 21 men in those female-dominated groups considered
himself the group's leader, but in the 1980s, 70 percent claimed
that status.
   Leadership status in those groups was attributed to the sole
male member 83 percent of the time in the 1970s, falling to 60
percent in the 1980s. As women's views of themselves as leaders
rose to 61 percent in the 1980s, the perceptions by all group
members of other women as leaders fell from 53 percent to 35
percent.
   ``Women appear to be much more willing to compete for
leadership, even as a lone female on a predominantly male team,''
Webber wrote.
   Webber cautioned that expected attitudes may have influenced
some men's responses in his most recent sample.
   ``Even among our younger male graduate students, with their
appearance of greater comfort with mixed sex teams, one can ask
whether actual behavior has changed as much as claims and
attributions,'' Webber said.
   ``For example, today it may not be as permissible for a male to
be critical of female behavior as in the past, so the 1980s
questionnaire responses could be a bit suspect.''

<HEAD>Non-OPEC Producers Meet To Debate Price Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of non-OPEC oil producers met in London Wednesday to
debate moves to halt plunging prices, while members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries considered similar
talks.
   Results of the London session weren't disclosed, but oil prices
edged upward in response to hopes that producing nations inside and
outside of the cartel would move quickly to stem the recent erosion
of the market.
   The meeting of non-OPEC officials was called by Egypt and was
held at the Mexican Embassy in London, even though Britain, which
rejects group pricing policies for its North Sea oil, wasn't
invited.
   Another European producer, Norway, declined to attend.
   Apart from Egypt, the other invited participants were the Soviet
Union, China, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman, Mexico and Colombia.
   ``The meeting is at expert level with no ministers involved,''
said a Mexican official, who declined to be identified. ``They just
want to talk about the situation in the market, although obviously
they are not in any position to take a decision.''
   Oil prices have declined by an average of about 20 percent over
the past few weeks amid reports of production excesses and price
discounting by OPEC members.
   On Tuesday, Egyptian oil minister Abdel-Hady Kandil said the
London meeting was not aimed against the 13-nation cartel, ``but is
an attempt by non-OPEC producers to help save the world oil market
from further deterioration.''
   There also was continued speculation that OPEC would convene its
own emergency meeting. Venezuela initiated calls for such a
conference, which were supported by Saudia Arabia and Indonesia,
among others. But sources said the Saudis preferred to hold
preliminary, informal talks to set an agenda for a meeting.
   Nigeria, whose oil minister Rilwanu Lukman is president of OPEC,
has yet to respond to the proposal. Sources said it was unlikely a
date would be set before Nigeria replied.
   The pricing committee is empowered by OPEC to hold an emergency
meeting of all 13 members of the cartel when prices drop
dramatically below the official price of $18 per barrel.
   The price slide was interrupted when reports of official concern
surfaced Tuesday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday,
contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark crude oil, settled at $15.49 per 42-gallon barrel, up 4
cents from the Tuesday close. The contract had gained 8 cents
Monday.

<HEAD>Northwest Will Impose Contract With Flight Attendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines said Wednesday it would
impose a contract on the carrier's 6,700 flight attendants April 1,
despite a stalemate over wage demands that nearly triggered a
strike last month.
   Northwest said a provision of the Railway Labor Act allowed it
to implement contract changes unilaterally following a 30-day
cooling-off period that ended Feb. 26.
   Flight attendants have voted to strike since then, but have
continued to work while pursuing negotiations with the airline
through their Teamsters union local.
   Union spokesman Jeffrey Musto said he had no immediate comment
on the airline's latest move because Teamsters lawyers were still
studying it.
   Terry Erskine, the airline's vice president of law and labor
relations, said the contract did not include a union proposal to
limit the number of years needed to elevate attendants to higher
salary levels.
   The main obstacle to reaching an agreement between the airline
and the Teamsters union local representing the attendants has been
a demand by the union to raise lower-paid B-scale attendants to
A-scale wages.
   Northwest has proposed extending the B-scale from five years to
eight years, meaning lower-wage flight attendants would have to
wait an additional three years before earning top-scale wages.
   But B-scale flight attendants say the airline is trying to break
a promise that they would earn A-scale wages after five years.
   The union also has objected to two-tier wage agreements, saying
they pit junior workers against senior workers.
   The issue has intensified since Northwest acquired Republic
Airlines in 1986. Roughly one-third of the 2,600 Republic
attendants work for B-scale wages and the other two-thirds have
said they wouldn't get enough out of Northwest's latest wage offer.
   Erskine told a news conference Wednesday that there are some
changes in the contract that will be imposed April 1, but they are
minor.
   Under the contract proposal that will be implemented, the
entry-level wage will go from more than $13,000 a year to $15,000 a
year and the top base wage will go from the current $32,000 up to
$35,000 a year, Erskine said.
   Erskine said the airline has not talked with the union about its
plan to impose the contract.

<HEAD>Regulator Ends Pledge To Take No Action Against Troubled FCA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators declined Wednesday to
renew their previous pledge not to take regulatory action against
the thrift unit of troubled Financial Corp. of America.
   The move came as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which
oversees the thrift industry, sought to reassure nervous Wall
Street firms who have lent more than $12 billion to American
Savings & Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., Irvine-based FCA's
thrift unit.
   The bank board declined to issue a new letter pledging not to
take regulatory action against FCA. Regulators have issued such
``comfort letters'' to FCA since late 1984, when the company was
swamped by heavy losses and fell below regulatory capital
requirements.
   At the end of 1987, the company for the first time posted a
negative net worth _ the difference between assets and liabilities.
   FCA has tried unsuccessfully to work out the problems by itself
but has been hindered by persistent problems with bad loans. FCA
added $551.2 million to its loan-loss provisions last year,
bringing the total since September 1984 to $1.7 billion.
   The bank board has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year to
find another institution willing to take over all or part of FCA on
terms that wouldn't be excessively costly to the Federal Savings &
Loan Insurance Corp., the bank board unit that insures customer
deposits up to $100,000 each.
   Because of its size, a failure by FCA would cause serious
problems for FSLIC.
   FCA, with $33.9 billion in assets at year-end, is the nation's
second-largest thrift holding company after Los Angeles-based H.F.
Ahmanson & Co.
   In its effort to reassure Wall Street, the bank board said in an
eight-page resolution Wednesday that it would use its ``best
efforts'' to insure that the market for reverse repurchase
agreements, or repos, isn't disrupted if American Savings defaults
on its obligations, or if regulators must take any action such as
placing the institution under receivership.
   American Savings has about $12.6 billion in repos outstanding.
   Repos are financing instruments in which a lender buys a
security and agrees to resell it to the original seller when it
reaches maturity. Repos usually mature in 30 days or less and the
collateral generally is in the form of mortgage-backed securities
held by the borrowing thrift.
   FCA's current comfort letter expires March 31.
   Asked if the bank board was considering renewing that letter or
issuing a new one, spokesman Karl Hoyle said, ``No. We feel today's
resolution deals with that question.''
   Some industry leaders have argued that past comfort letters had
unduly restricted the bank board's options in dealing with FCA's
problems.
   While Wednesday's resolution didn't say the bank board would
take any action against American Savings, it did say it issued the
resolution because of ``the potential disruption to the markets in
such repos that could arise as a result of a receivership,
conservatorship or similar proceeding with respect to American.''
   FCA's fourth quarter loss of $224.6 million boosted its deficit
for the year to $468 million for all of 1987, and gave it a
negative net worth of $163.4 million at year-end.
   In a brief statement, FCA spokeswoman Layna Browdy said, ``We
commend the bank board and Wall Street for arranging this agreement
(on repos). We've had a good and long-standing relationship with
Wall Street which is being helped by this latest actoin taken by
the bank board.''
   FCA declined to elaborate or to say comment on the board's
decision not to issue a new comfort letter.

<HEAD>Douglas Begins Assembly of New Generation Jumbo Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. executives,
using a symbolic gold-plated rivet, Wednesday began assembly of the
first MD-11, the company's entry into a fierce competition to
provide a new generation of jetliners.
   The action soothed concerns that were expressed about whether
the new airliner would ever get off the ground after the company
earlier this year scaled back the number of orders it had received
for the plane.
   During a ceremony at the company's Douglas Aircraft Co. plant in
Long Beach, Douglas President James Worsham announced that two more
carriers had ordered a total of six MD-11s. Identity of the new
carriers wasn't disclosed.
   The new orders brought the total to 16 customers and 99 of the
jetliners, which sell for between $90 million and $100 million
each. If all the planes are purchased, it would create $9.9 billion
in revenue for Douglas, a division of St. Louis-based McDonnell
Douglas.
   Douglas spokesman Don Hanson said Wednesday that 31 of the
orders are firm, 45 are conditional or options and 23 are listed as
``reserves,'' which the company defines as falling into ``various
categories of intent to acquire the airplane.''
   The MD-11 is a roomier, longer-range and more fuel-efficient
version of its current jumbo jet, the DC-10.
   However, the MD-11 faces a tough fight with Seattle-based Boeing
Co. and the Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, to provide
the new generation of passenger jetliners in what is likely to be a
shrinking market.
   Analysts say there is room in that market for only two
manufacturers and it is a toss-up as to which will survive.
   In what is generally seen as a weakness for the MD-11, the maker
has yet to land an order from a domestic commercial passenger
airline. The only domestic order it has received is from Federal
Express, the parcel-delivery service.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to recast, CLARIFY that Black & Decker

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp. on Wednesday refused to
enter talks proposed by its target American Standard Inc. over the
toolmaker's $2.26 billion hostile buyout offer.
   Black & Decker said American Standard had asked it to enter into
a standstill and confidentiality agreement under which it would
provide Black & Decker with non-public corporate information.
   Such an agreement would prohibit Black & Decker from taking
additional action to pursue its hostile bid for the New York-based
plumbing and air conditioning maker.
   Nolan D. Archibald, Black & Decker chairman and chief executive,
called the conditions of the proposal ``excessively restrictive and
totally unacceptable.''
   He said Black & Decker would continue to ``pursue aggressively''
its $73-a-share bid.
   American Standard rose 37{ cents to $73.37{ a share on the New
York Stock Exchange. Black & Decker rose 25 cents to $18 in heavy
trading.
   American Standard on Tuesday announced it would continue
developing a recapitalization plan aimed at thwarting Black &
Decker's hostile buyout offer, but said it expected to engage in
discussions and negotiations with Black & Decker and other
potential acquirers.
   On Wednesday, American Standard denied asking for a standstill
agreement, saying it only sought to uphold ``shareholder values.''
   ``We have just requested that they not drop their tender offer
and conduct a street sweep...thereby preempting higher bids for the
company,'' said spokeswoman Linda King. ``We were puzzled to see
Black & Decker's release. We are trying to pursue a reasonable
course and are talking to Black & Decker's legal counsel to resolve
the situation.''
   In a street sweep, a bidder tries to gain a controlling interest
in a target company by buying huge blocks of the target company's
stock rapidly in regular market transactions.
   In a prepared statement, Black & Decker said it had a right to
the same information on the same terms that American Standard had
made available to third parties supporting the recapitalization.
   Those parties include banks who have agreed to let American
Standard borrow nearly $2 billion to finance its plan and Emerson
Electric Co., which has agreed to buy $160 million in American
Standard junk bonds.
   Thomas T. Taylor, president of Towson-based Chesapeake
Securities Research Corp., said American Standard was trying to buy
time to find a ``white knight'' friendly suitor in proposing a
truce with Black & Decker.
   On Friday, Black & Decker sweetened its offer for the fourth
time _ to $2.33 billion _ just hours after American Standard had
increased its own competing offer to shareholders.
   American Standard said Monday it would pursue other ways to
boost its recapitalization plan before it accepted Black & Decker's
takeover bid.
   Analysts estimate the American Standard plan, paying
shareholders a combination of cash, debt, and stock in the
recapitalized company, is worth slightly more than $2 billion.
