   Grand Metropolitan PLC acquired the Pillsbury
Co. on Sunday, 2{ months after the British conglomerate started its
hostile takeover bid for the Minneapolis-based food giant, the two
companies announced.
   Grand Met agreed to purchase all outstanding shares of Pillsbury
common stock for $66 per share in cash, $3 higher than Grand Met's
most recent tender offer, which was made last week. The total deal
is worth $5.68 billion.
   The tender offer will expire at midnight Jan. 3 unless extended,
according to a statement issued by both companies.
   Pillsbury makes Pillsbury flour, Green Giant vegetables and a
variety of other products, and also owns the Burger King,
Benningan's and Steak & Ale restaurant chains. The company has
104,000 employees. During the fiscal year that ended May 31, the
company had nearly $6.2 billion in revenues.
   The U.S. products and services under the Grand Met corporate
umbrella include Alpo pet foods, Pearle Vision Centres and J&B
Scotch. Among the British concerns run by the conglomerate are
gambling casinos.
   Karl Cambronne, a lawyer for a group of dissident shareholders
who sued to have Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' defense against
takeovers invalidated, called the buyout news ``just wonderful. I
think the shareholders did well.''
   Just Friday, judges in two states issued key rulings that
bolstered Grand Met's bid by weakening Pillsbury's anti-takeover
efforts.
   On Oct. 3, the day before Grand Met launched its $60-per-share
bid, Pillsbury stock was trading at $39 per share. On Oct. 4, after
the bid was announced, it rose to $57. On Friday, the stock closed
at $62\.
   Any shares not purchased in the tender offer will be acquired by
Grand Met in a subsequent merger at the same $66-per-share cash
price, according to the statement.
   The boards of both companies approved the offer Sunday, the
statement said.
   The takeover of Pillsbury giant comes less than a month after
another giant of the industry, RJR Nabisco, agreed to be taken over
in a leveraged buyout. The $25 billion deal was the largest in U.S.
corporate history.
   The offer for Pillsbury is conditioned upon a number of things,
among them that there be tendered a number of Pillsbury shares that
would represent at least a majority of the total fully diluted
shares outstanding, according to the statement.
   As of the close of business on Friday, 61,848,918 of Pillsbury
common shares, representing about 72.4 percent of the company's
outstanding shares, had been tendered to Grand Met and not withdrawn.
   The Pillsbury board determined that the terms of the offer and
the merger were fair and in the best interests of Pillsbury
stockholders, the statement said. The board also recommended that
Pillsbury stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares.
   ``We are pleased that we have succeeded in protecting the
interests of our shareholders, employees, franchisees and
communities, and that we have reached a negotiated agreement that
works to the advantage of everyone,'' Philip L. Smith, chairman and
chief executive officer of Pillsbury, said in a statement.
   Ian A. Martin, chief executive of Grand Met's U.S. operations,
said Grand Met officials also are pleased with the agreement.
   ``Pillsbury is the perfect fit to enable Grand Metropolitan to
achieve its strategy of becoming a world leader in foods and
retailing, as well as the drinks sector,'' Martin said. ``Our
company has the resources and expertise to grasp this opportunity.
Pillsbury foods and Burger King will play a vital role in helping us
to realize these objectives.
   ``The merger will greatly expand Grand Metropolitan's established
presence in the huge U.S. marketplace, while enabling us to open new
business opportunities for Pillsbury in global markets.
   Lawyers for Pillsbury, some of its shareholders and Grand Met met
for nearly three hours Saturday with a judge, but all parties
refused to comment on the closed meeting.
   The meeting came the day after Grand Met won a major battle in
its fight for Pillsbury.
   Justice William Duffy of the Court of Chancery in Wilmington,
Del., said Friday he would issue preliminary injunctions sought by
Grand Met to invalidate Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' takeover defense
and temporarily block the company's planned spinoff of Burger King.
   Ruling in a separate lawsuit filed in Minnesota by dissident
Pillsbury shareholders, Hennepin County District Judge Thomas Carey
on Friday also temporarily blocked the Burger King spinoff and said
he probably would side with Duffy on the ``poison pill'' issue.
   Grand Met had asked for the pill's removal so it could proceed
with its tender offer, which was $63 a share at that time.

<HEAD>Fidel Castro to Visit Venezuela for First Time in 29 years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Saturday that
Cuban President Fidel Castro will come to the inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Andres Perez in his first visit to Venezuela
in nearly 30 years.
   Citing an unidentified aide to Perez, the newspaper El Nacional
said Castro accepted an invitation to the inauguration, scheduled
for Feb. 2. It said he will travel to Venezuela that day.
   Government spokesmen gave no official confirmation of the report.
   Perez won the presidential election on Dec. 4, becoming the first
Venezuelan president to be re-elected to office. He served his first
term from 1974-1979.
   He has said one of his first goals is to re-establish diplomatic
ties with Cuba. ``Cuba is a Latin American nation. What happens in
Cuba affects us all,'' Perez said in his first official press
conference Thursday.
   The two countries severed relations in 1980 over the Caracas
trial of Cuban dissident Orlando Bosch, although they have
maintained sporadic contact since then.
   Bosch was acquitted three times in Venezuela of planning a bomb
attack on a Cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 people. He was
also convicted in the United States in 1976 of a bazooka attack on a
Polish ship that had left Cuba.
   He later returned to the United States and is being held in
federal prison near Miami pending deportation proceedings.
   The Cuban leader visited Venezuela in 1959, shortly after he took
power in Cuba. Venezuela had just elected its first president,
Romulo Betancourt, who succeeded ousted strongman Gen. Marcos Perez
Jimenez.
   Relations between Cuba and Venezuela were strained in the 1960s
while Betancourt struggled to crush a Castro-backed guerrilla
insurgency that threatened Venezuela's infant democracy.
   In August, Castro traveled to Quito, Ecuador, in his first visit
to South America in 17 years.

   A 16-year-old student at a private Baptist
school who allegedly killed one teacher and wounded another before
firing into a filled classroom apparently ``just snapped,'' the
school's pastor said.
   ``I don't know how it could have happened,'' said George Sweet,
pastor of Atlantic Shores Baptist Church. ``This is a good,
Christian school. We pride ourselves on discipline. Our kids are
good kids.''
   The Atlantic Shores Christian School sophomore was arrested and
charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, malicious
assault and related felony charges for the Friday morning shooting.
Police would not release the boy's name because he is a juvenile,
but neighbors and relatives identified him as Nicholas Elliott.
   Police said the student was tackled by a teacher and other
students when his semiautomatic pistol jammed as he fired on the
classroom as the students cowered on the floor crying ``Jesus save
us! God save us!''
   Friends and family said the boy apparently was troubled by his
grandmother's death and the divorce of his parents and had been
tormented by classmates.
   Nicholas' grandfather, Clarence Elliott Sr., said Saturday that
the boy's parents separated about four years ago and his maternal
grandmother, Channey Williams, died last year after a long illness.
   The grandfather also said his grandson was fascinated with guns.
   ``The boy was always talking about guns,'' he said. ``He knew a
lot about them. He knew all the names of them _ none of those little
guns like a .32 or a .22 or nothing like that. He liked the big
ones.''
   The slain teacher was identified as Karen H. Farley, 40. The
wounded teacher, 37-year-old Sam Marino, was in serious condition
Saturday with gunshot wounds in the shoulder.
   Police said the boy also shot at a third teacher, Susan Allen,
31, as she fled from the room where Marino was shot. He then shot
Marino again before running to a third classroom where a Bible class
was meeting.
   The youngster shot the glass out of a locked door before opening
fire, police spokesman Lewis Thurston said.
   When the youth's pistol jammed, he was tackled by teacher Maurice
Matteson, 24, and other students, Thurston said.
   ``Once you see what went on in there, it's a miracle that we
didn't have more people killed,'' Police Chief Charles R. Wall said.
   Police didn't have a motive, Detective Tom Zucaro said, but
believe the boy's primary target was not a teacher but a classmate.
   Officers found what appeared to be three Molotov cocktails in the
boy's locker and confiscated the gun and several spent shell
casings. Fourteen rounds were fired before the gun jammed, Thurston
said.
   The gun, which the boy carried to school in his knapsack, was
purchased by an adult at the youngster's request, Thurston said,
adding that authorities have interviewed the adult, whose name is
being withheld pending an investigation by the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The shootings occurred in a complex of four portable classrooms
for junior and senior high school students outside the main building
of the 4-year-old school. The school has 500 students in
kindergarten through 12th grade.
   Police said they were trying to reconstruct the sequence of
events and had not resolved who was shot first. The body of Ms.
Farley was found about an hour after the shootings behind a
classroom door.

   The president of Bethune-Cookman
College returned Saturday from a trip to New York with a $700,000
donation from entertainer Bill Cosby.
   Oswald Bronson received the check Friday at Cosby's home. Cosby
also gave $800,000 to Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn.,
Bronson said.
   Cosby, one of the richest men in show business, has donated
millions of dollars over the years to traditionally black colleges,
including $20 million given to Atlanta's Spelman College last month.
   Bronson said Cosby wants the donation to Bethune-Cookman
earmarked for scholarships in natural and physical sciences.
   ``He was very interested in the strength of our science and
mathematics departments,'' Bronson said.
   Ernest Cook Sr., vice president for physical affairs, said the
money will be used to fund about 10 full four-year scholarships each
year.
   Bronson solicitated the donation when he met Cosby at a dinner
party two months ago. The college president said he was so
persistent that Cosby later joked he expected to find Bronson hiding
in his salad.
   Faculty members were stunned by news of the donation. Bronson
said Cosby had sworn him to secrecy.

<HEAD>Reports Say New Whale Species Discovered in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unclassified small whale has been discovered
in Peru, and scientists at Washington's Smithsonian Institute call
it a new species, government and newspaper reports said Saturday.
   The whale, dubbed Mesoplodon Peruvianus, belongs to a genus of
beaked whales. However, it differs in its relatively short length of
14 to 24 feet, the government gazette El Peruano said.
   The Mesoplodon Peruvianus has characteristics similar to other
small whales, porpoises and dolphins, the gazette quoted Carlos del
Rio, president of the Peruvian National Council of Science and
Technology, as saying. He said the whale has never before been
classified, according to the report.
   Del Rio said the scientific world was first alerted to the
possibility of a new species when James G. Mead of the Smithsonian
Institute's National Museum of Natural History discovered a skull
fragment of the whale on a beach near Lima in 1976.
   Mead was not available for comment Saturday.
   Del Rio said that since the initial find, a few of the whales
have been accidentially caught in fishermen's nets or have washed up
on Pacific beaches in central Peru. However, he said none has so far
been seen alive in its natural habitat.
   The weekly newspaper Lima Times reported that the Smithsonian
termed the whale a new species after studies of a carcass of an
adult whale, which had been found intact earlier this year.
   The Peruvian conservation group Ecco, which participated in the
search and classification, said scientists are still unsure why the
species has not been spotted elsewhere. Ecco Vice President Tony
Luscombe of the United States said the whales may need the cold
Pacific currents that wash the shores of Peru and Chile.

   An overloaded ferry taking schoolchildren on a
field trip capsized and sank in southern China, killing 55 people
and leaving seven missing, the China News Service said in a dispatch
seen Sunday.
   The 183 passengers and four crew members ``enormously exceeded''
the ferry's capacity and the ship capsized Wednesday before it had
sailed 200 yards, the report said. It did not say how many people
the boat was designed to hold.
   It said that by Friday, 125 survivors had been rescued, 55 bodies
were found and seven people were missing. The accident occurred off
Hainan island, the report said.
   The news service said the passengers were 183 students and
teachers from a high school and primary school in Qiongzhong County,
who were going to take the ferry to visit a hydroelectric power
station.
   On September 22, another overloaded ferry sank in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region bordering Vietnam, leaving 61 people dead
and one missing.
   The Ministry of Communications, which is responsible for inland
water navigation, announced in August it had begun an investigation
into the safety of China's river vessels to determine if standards
should be tightened.
   The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min
River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and
the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in
which 71 people drowned.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived
Sunday on the first stop of an Asian tour, which officials ope will
pave the way for a Japan-Soviet summit and ease tensions over a
longstanding border dispute.
   ``Under a new atmosphere, Japan-Soviet relations are able to
enter a new track of normal development,'' Shevardnadze told
reporters after his Aeroflot jet landed at Tokyo's Haneda
International Airport. ``This is something we have been waiting
for.''
   Substantial political dialogue between the two Asian powers is
overdue, he said, adding, ``We're trying to decide what to do.''
   Shevardnadze's visit to Japan, the Philippines and communist ally
North Korea comes as Moscow courts capitalist Asian nations with
requests for economic cooperation and promises of military cutbacks
in the region.
   In the latest overture, contained in a U.N. address Dec. 7,
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged to ``reduce
significantly our armed forces in the Asian part of the country.''
   Asian debtor nations, including the Philippines, welcomed
Gorbachev's suggestion of a 100-year moratorium on Third World debt.
   But Asian and Soviet officials say Gorbachev's Asian initiatives
since his visit to the Soviet Pacific port of Vladivostok on July
28, 1986, have produced few concrete payoffs.
   Soviet relations with China have improved recently, but relations
with most of the rest of Asia remain stagnant or chilly _ crippling
Moscow's efforts to expand trade and technology exchanges with
industrialized Asia.
   Theoretically, Moscow has much to offer: an enormous potential
market for Asian goods, scientific and technical aid and abundant
natural resources.
   In return, Asia could sell high technology and provide badly
needed foreign investment.
   During his four-day Japan visit, Shevardnadze will meet with
Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno for talks expected to include the
dispute over Soviet-held islands off Japan's northern Hokkaido
province.
   Both Moscow and Tokyo claim the southernmost section of the
Kurile chain, but Soviet troops ousted the 17,000 Japanese residents
at the end of World War II and have occupied the territory since.
   The dispute has been the main obstacle preventing the two nations
from signing a peace treaty to formally end wartime hostilities.
   In downtown Tokyo, authorities tightened security around the
Soviet Embassy where the foreign minister is staying. Busloads of
police were seen on street corners near the walled compound, a
favorite target of right-wing groups demanding return of the islands.
   Japanese officials say they will also renew a 2-year-old
invitation for Gorbachev to visit Japan. Gorbachev's plans for a
Tokyo visit two years ago were postponed.
   ``This time we'll have foreign ministerial sessions,'' Uno told
the Japan Broadcasting Corp., ``but naturally I'd like to see a
(Prime Minister Noboru) Takeshita-Gorbachev summit and I intend to
bring up this subject during this round.''
   Shevardnadze is expected to discuss Japanese investment in
Siberia during his visit. Gorbachev has remarked that his plans to
develop the vast Soviet Far East will require substantial input from
Japan.
   This Soviet need for advanced technology may have given Japan
leverage to negotiate over the disputed islands, said Ichiro
Suetsugu, who heads the private Council on National Security
Problems.
   Japanese business and government officials say a major diplomatic
breakthrough would help but not guarantee expanded economic ties.
   They complain Moscow lacks the hard currency needed to pay for
high-technology imports, joint ventures are unprofitable and Japan
doesn't need more Soviet timber or oil.
   After his visit to Tokyo, Shevardnadze will travel to the
Philippines and North Korea. His trip takes place as Soviet-backed
Vietnam is withdrawing more troops from Cambodia, helping to ease
tensions in the region.
   Shevardnadze is traveling to Manila at his own initiative in what
Philippine officials call a ``get to know you'' visit. He will be
the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit the former U.S. colony
since President Corazon Aquino assumed office in February 1986.
   Officials in Australia and New Zealand, the biggest powers in the
South Pacific, have said Soviet economic penetration of the region
could lead to a dangerous Kremlin military presence.

<TEXT>
   A TWA jetliner with only a flight crew
aboard lost part of its right wing and made an emergency landing
Saturday at Kansas City International Airport, officials said.
   The Boeing 747 was being flown to Chicago by a three-member
cockpit crew.
   It landed safely at the Kansas City airport at 3:48 p.m., about
an hour after it left the airport, said Sandra Campbell, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   No one was injured.
   Trans World Airlines spokesman Don Morrison said a 4-by-8 section
of the wing's metal fabric covering was missing. The Boeing 747 has
a wing span of about 195 feet.
   ``It was not a major problem. There were no passengers on board.
There wasn't anything of an emergency nature about it,'' said
Morrison from St. Louis early Sunday.
   The aircraft was about 100 miles from the airport when the pilot
noticed part of the wing was gone and requested clearance for the
emergency return.
   Officials said they did not know what caused part of the wing to
fall off.
   ``Apparently the crew had no idea how or why it happened,''
Campbell said. ``The pilot just noticed that part of the wing was
gone.''
   ``Depending on the extent of the damage, the pilot can compensate
for it. Apparently that was the case here because there were no
serious problems with the landing,'' she said.

   Heavy fog that halted air traffic at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and disrupted travel plans for
thousands of passengers lifted Saturday night, allowing some flights
to resume.
   A slight change in upper atmosphere winds helped clear the fog
about 12 hours earlier than expected, National Weather Service
forecaster Hank Treick said.
   Visibility at the airport improved from near zero to five miles,
and some planes landed beginning about 8 p.m. Treick said fog could
create more delays overnight but the worst of it had passed.
   Abner Thomas, airport supervisor at Sea-Tac, said late Saturday
afternoon that there were few planes on the ground because there was
no traffic getting in. Minimum restrictions are not as severe for
aircraft taking off as for planes that are landing, so the airlines
got their planes out of Seattle when they could.
   By midafternoon, only two flights had been able to land because
the fog restricted visibility below the minimum of 700 feet.
   Some incoming flights were diverted to Moses Lake, Portland,
Ore., and Vancouver, British Columbia, where the passengers were
given the option of either getting to Seattle by bus or waiting to
see if the fog cleared at Sea-Tac.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Reported Arrested As Power Struggle Deepens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who was sworn in as the new
prime minister of this island nation Sunday was arrested hours later
by security forces loyal to his ousted predecessor, radio reports
said.
   Barak Sope's arrest fueled the dispute over who is in power in
Vanuatu, a country of 130,000 people about 1,200 miles northeast of
Brisbane, Australia.
   Sope was sworn in Sunday by President George Sokomanu, who on
Friday announced he was dissolving Parliament and dismissing Prime
Minister Walter Lini. Sope and Lini, who took office in 1980, have
been locked in a power struggle for a year.
   Lini said he would not yield power, and many in Parliament
questioned whether Sokomanu's actions were constitutional.
   Radio reports in Sydney said that in addition to Sope, pro-Lini
troops arrested a Cabinet minister whom Lini fired earlier this year
and his chauffeur and secretary.
   The reports quoted Sokomanu as saying the troops ``were in full
combat gear. Some were carrying machine guns, others had rifles.''
   Earlier Sunday, Sokomanu appointed a five-member interim
government which he said would rule Vanuatu until national elections
in February.
   Lini became prime minister in 1980 when Vanuatu, formerly the
Anglo-French New Hebrides, gained independence.
   Sokomanu's decision to dismiss him and dissolve parliament
followed by-elections last week that gave Lini's governing Vanu'aku
party two-thirds control of the 46-seat Parliament.
   The opposition boycotted the vote, and Sokomanu said the present
Parliament therefore was unconstitutional because no opposition
candidates were put up for election.
   Sope told reporters he might seek military help from Australia or
other Pacific states if Vanuatu's security forces refuse to support
him.
   Australia has said it will continue to recognize Lini as the
legitimate prime minister.

   Gunmen stormed the home of a prominent
opposition politician who once belonged to the ruling party and
killed five people Sunday, and 19 other people were slain in
pre-election violence, police said.
   Seven people were critically wounded in the attack on a campaign
meeting at the home of Neville Fernando in Panadura, nine miles
south of Colombo, said police who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fernando was hospitalized for shock.
   Panadura police blamed the attack on the People's Liberation
Front, a group of Sinhalese extremists that has vowed to stop
Monday's presidential election. Fernando, a Sinhalese, formerly
belonged to President Junius R. Jayewardene's United National Party
but left it to work for the Freedom Party headed by presidential
candidate and former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
   Nineteen other people were killed in a series of attacks in the
Sinhalese heartland of central and southern Sri Lanka, according to
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The victims included two Sri Lankan soldiers killed Sunday in an
attack on a polling center in Kamburapitiya, 75 miles southeast of
Colombo, and two soldiers killed Sunday near Epawellia, about 90
miles northeast of Colombo. The officials blamed both attacks on the
People's Liberation Front.
   Six people, including two United National Party workers, were
killed Saturday near Monaragala, about 100 miles east of Colombo.
   The bodies of nine suspected Sinhalese extremists were found in
several locations in southern Sri Lanka on Sunday, according to the
officials, who gave no indication who was behind the killings.
   The People's Liberation Front opposes Jayewardene for signing an
accord last year that granted some autonomy to the minority Tamils
and has vowed to kill anyone supporting the pact.
   It also opposes Monday's election, saying it won't be conducted
fairly under Jayewardene.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's population and
dominate the government and military. Tamils comprise 18 percent.

   A group of doctors,
firefighters, rescue workers and specially trained dogs returned
Sunday from Soviet Armenia, where they spent a week assisting with
efforts to rescue victims of a devastating earthquake.
   Ten firefighters from Fairfax, Va., eight firefighters from
Miami, Fla., eight dogs and their 12 handlers were aboard a
chartered 727 that arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington at 8:31 a.m. Several doctors also were aboard but
officials could not immediately say how many.
   ``It's hard to put into words the absolute, total devastation of
the area,'' said Michael Tamillow, a member of the group who said he
led a rescue team. ``A private car going down the street with a
coffin on top. ... It was those kind of things that brought things
together.''
   Tamillow said he was amazed at the resilience of the Armenian
people and credited Soviet troops with helping rescue workers from
the United States and other countries.
   The team was assembled Dec. 9, two days after the earthquake, at
the request of the Office of Foreign Assistance, an arm of the
Agency for International Development.
   A military transport team took the team to Leninakan, a Soviet
city virtually destroyed by the earthquake, which may have killed up
to 55,000 people and left an estimated 500,000 homeless.
   The group began preparing for the trip home on Friday after
Soviet officials determined there was little chance of finding
additional survivors. The dogs are trained to find survivors in the
rubble.
   At the base to greet the team were members of their families and
co-workers. Many waited several hours because of delays in the
flight. Also on hand were members of the Armenian Relief Society, a
group based in Watertown, Mass. Society representatives presented
the rescue workers with Christmas baskets containing fruit, cheese
and candies.
   In a related development, the Armenian group said 20 kidney
dialysis machines and other medical supplies were flown to the
Soviet Union Sunday on an Aeroflot flight that left from Andrews. A
team of medical experts left separately from Newark, N.J., the
organization said. Food and clothing donated by private industry
were aboard that flight.

<HEAD>Churchgoers Protest Sunday Activities; Prime Minister In Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Churchgoers put up roadblocks around the
capital Sunday to protest relaxation of a ban on Sunday leisure
activities, causing traffic problems that led to cancellation of
flights out of Suva's airport.
   Also Sunday, Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who led the
country to independence from Britain in 1970, was admitted to a
hospital complaining of chest pains, doctors said.
   The roadblocks were dismantled after a personal appeal from the
military chief, Sitiveni Rabuka.
   Australian Associated Press said Rabuka, leader of two military
coups last year, made the appeal on national radio. Rabuka is a
Methodist, like those who were protesting.
   A spokesman for the demonstrators told Radio Fiji that Methodists
regard Sunday as a day of rest and for the family, not a day of
work. He said the action was meant as a display of faith.
   An almost total ban on Sunday activity, including organized sport
and beach parties, was imposed soon after the second military coup
as a result of strong lobbying by the Methodist Church, which is
dominated by indigenous Fijians.
   But since then a list of exemptions has grown.
   Families are now allowed to picnic as well as plant and harvest
vital sugar cane crops. Resumption of limited Sunday public
transport apparently infuriated some worshipers.
   Church President Josateki Koroi said the protest did not have his
blessing.
   AAP said several hundred Methodists manned about 70 roadblocks
that stopped cars and buses moving around the city and its outskirts.
   State-owned Radio Fiji and privately run FM-96 radio both
reported that about a dozen roadblocks had been set up on suburban
and city streets as well as the highway linking Suva to its domestic
airport, forcing the cancellation of flights by domestic carrier
Fiji Air.
   A placard at one blockade read: ``Cars take a rest on Sunday.''
   Mara, 68, whose defeat in elections last year led to Rabuka's
first coup, was admitted to the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in
Suva. ``He was feeling unwell but has now recovered,'' a spokesman
said. ``He has elected to stay in hospital and undergo medical
tests.''
   Rabuka staged the South Pacific's first military takeover on May
14, 1987 following the election of an Indian-dominated government
headed by Timoci Bavadra, who is Fijian. Bavadra defeated Mara, who
had served since 1970.
   Indians outnumber ethnic Fijians among the 715,000 population.
Rabuka said his coup was aimed at protecting the political rights of
ethnic Fijians.
   Rabuka staged a second coup in September 1987 when an interim
administration he had set up with Mara as its leader began drafting
a constitution that Rabuka said did not protect ethnic rights.
   Rabuka reappointed Mara again after the second coup.

   Everybody complains about the weather, but some
want to know more than just why it rained on their parade.
   They wonder where it's most likely to snow in November, when a
cold front froze pipes in Kentucky or where cars are most likely to
rust.
   The answers are often available from the federal government,
which has been collecting weather information for more than a
century.
   Millions and millions of weather facts are stored in the archives
of the National Climatic Data Center, the climate-watching division
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Requests continually pour in to the center's offices in
Asheville, N.C., ranging from youngsters asking for ``everything''
about the weather to specific information needed by lawyers and
professors, engineers and manufacturers, utilities and airlines, car
makers and farmers, members of Congress and Naval officers,
architects and designers, elderly people looking for warm retirement
homes and contractors who want to build them.
   Columbus, Ohio, for example, called on the data center for
detailed weather information to help support its bid to host trials
for the 1992 Olympic marathon.
   A company planning to shoot a television commercial wanted to
know where it could find lots of snow in November. The
recommendation: Stampede Pass, Wash., in the Cascade Mountains.
   Lawyers investigating the May 3, 1988, fire that gutted part of
the First Interstate Building in Los Angeles requested hour-by-hour
weather data for that date.
   A Kentucky company charged with polluting a stream near a
national park claimed the chemical spill was caused by a sudden cold
front that froze pipes. The center provided statistics to help
settle the question.
   And a consultant for the automotive industry collected extensive
temperature and precipitation data for cities across the country, in
an effort to determine areas with the most weather-induced rust.
   Phone calls, letters and electronic queries totaled some 73,000
requests for information during the past year, said Rex Snodgrass of
the data center.
   Nearly one-third of the requests come from lawyers, Snodgrass
said in a telephone interview.
   Some records at the center go back to Benjamin Franklin, and
detailed data extend well into the last century, said Snodgrass.
   Simple questions are usually answered on the phone, he said, but
customers who need something more have to pay for the research
required. Regular customers set up accounts, others can use checks
or credit cards.
   The data center publishes a variety of reports and pamphlets
compiling information collected by the National Weather Service and
its thousands of volunteer weather observers nationwide.
   Customers can get reports of hourly weather observations at
hundreds of locations, upper air weather measurements taken twice a
day at many places, radar observations, satellite data, hourly
reports of radiation from the sun and a wide array of other
information.
   For example, the popular television show Hollywood Squares
decided to include questions about major U.S. floods in its quizzes,
so researchers called the data center for information.
   One freelance writer recently requested detailed weather
information for the Trenton, N.J., area for Oct. 30, 1938 _ the date
and place of Orson Welles' famous ``War of the Worlds'' radio show
about an invasion from Mars.
   Another writer preparing a history of the last flight of Amelia
Earhart requested weather data in order to help calculate fuel
consumption of the missing airplane.
   The drought last summer generated interest from news media and
the public, of course, with many farmers seeking detailed rainfall
records for their areas to support of drought insurance claims.
   Others in agriculture use the center too. For example, a
California company choosing a location for a new strawberry farm
requested freeze-frost data for several northern California
locations.
   A Florida farmer wants to expand his Chinese cabbage farm but is
looking for land in South Carolina which is less costly, if the
climate will permit his crop to grow there.
   A Georgia tree farm is using temperature data to determine when
the flathead apple borer will likely emerge and can be sprayed.
Farmers battling the moisture-sensitive southern pine beetle also
have been using rainfall records from the center.
   Government data users include the Navy, which is compiling an
atlas of weekly ice conditions in cold regions, a Senate committee
studying the theory of greenhouse climate warming, post office
officials testing new mail sorting machines that may be sensitive to
heat and even Border Patrol officials looking at how weather affects
drug smugglers.
   When needles and other used medical supplies began washing up on
beaches this past summer, the center assisted the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation by providing tide and wind
data to help trace the source of the materials.
   Other requests during the past year included temperature and
snowfall data for a developer considering building a ski resort in
the Smokey Mountains, wind information for planners of a regatta in
Florida, visibility data for a company that wants to build a tall
building near the Cleveland airport and rainfall information for an
Audubon Society project studying acid rain.

   Emergency crews worked Sunday to clear one
foot of snow from the streets of cities and villages in northern
Greece.
   The airport in the city of Salonica remained closed for the third
straight day as frigid temperatures and fierce winds kept the runway
at Mikra International Airport iced over, an airport official said.
   Storms that began Thursday dumped one foot of snow on Salonica.
   More than 150 remote mountain villages in northern Greece
remained snowed in, police said. Bulldozers and snow plows were
working round-the-clock to clear roads leading to the villages,
police said.
   Gale force winds tearing across the Ionian and Aegean seas also
kept ships tied up in most of the country's harbors.
   Olympic Airways, the national carrier, said more than five
domestic flights to Aegean islands were canceled Sunday because of
the fierce winds.

<HEAD>Bush Likely to Change Course Despite Reagan Claim of Mandate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said the voters gave George
Bush a mandate to continue the Reagan administration policies, but
Bush appears likely to change course on some key issues, both
critics and supporters say.
   ``I think, fiscally, circumstances will dictate that he has no
choice but to be, if anything, a little more conservative than
Reagan; in other areas he could be substantially more moderate,''
says Iowa's Republican Rep. Jim Leach, who supported Bush for the
GOP presidential nomination.
   ``It is obvious that he will not permit Central America or
Nicaragua to become the centerpiece of his foreign policy as Reagan
did,'' says Lawrence Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric
Affairs, a organization often critical of the administration.
   ``You are not going to hear from him the same kind of fierce
rhetoric about limited government that you have heard the last eight
years,'' says M.E. Bradford, a professor of English at the
University of Dallas and a writer on Southern conservatism. ``The
sharp edge is going to be off a lot of things.''
   There are other hints that winds of change may be blowing despite
the much-heralded continuity of the vice president's succession to
the presidency by election for the first time in 150 years.
   As his national security adviser, Bush has chosen Brent
Scowcroft, whose views have often differed from those of the Reagan
administration. Scowcroft supported the single-warhead mobile
Midgetman when the Pentagon wanted to scrap the missile and deploy
the 10-warhead MX on rail cars instead.
   And in testimony last year, Scowcroft called the administration's
``broad'' interpretation of the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, a
translation designed to ease the way for tests of the Star Wars
space defense system, ``unbefitting.''
   Black civil rights activist Jesse Jackson met with Bush Nov. 30
and said he was able to discuss matters with him that he had never
been able to raise with Reagan. He said they talked about
anti-semitism and racism among other subjects.
   The same day, Bush met with environmental leaders, one of whom,
Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said the
difference between the president and the president-elect was like
``night and day'' although Bush made no specific commitments. Major
environmental groups opposed Bush during the campaign, but he
repeatedly called himself an environmentalist, something Reagan
seldom does.
   In East-West relations, Reagan has consistently framed the basic
conflict with the Soviets in moral terms. The president-elect speaks
more often in terms of great power competition. It was Reagan, not
Bush, who used to call the Soviet Union ``the evil empire.''
   In the campaign, Bush, like Reagan, promised to pick judges who
would interpret the law, not make it. He departed from anything
Reagan ever said, however, in also promising there would be no
ideological ``litmus test'' for judicial nominations.
   With all of this, there are still more similarities than
differences in their views, judging from their own statements and
those of others.
   ``George Bush has gotten his mandate from the American people,
the mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and
prosperity,'' Reagan said four days after the election.
   Most insistently, Bush has restated the key pledge on which
Reagan stood for eight years: No new taxes.
   ``For the foreseeable future, I think the people who are looking
for him to change his mind about that are very foolish,'' said the
conservative scholar Bradford.
   Leach, however, said that ``circumstances and compromises could
mean some movement'' on this issue although Bush will ``without
doubt ... be much more disinclined to look at the tax structure''
than his Democratic critics.
   Bradford and the Hemispheric Affairs Council's Birns agreed that
in dealing with the Sandinista government of Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, Bush would seek a solution more acceptable to
Democrats in Congress than the all-out military aid for the Contra
rebels that Reagan has favored.
   ``I don't think the Contras will be abandoned,'' said Bradford.
``But I think he will try very hard to bring a lot of Democrats with
him.''
   ``I think his instincts are the same as Reagan's,'' the Texas
professor added. ``He would like to blow Ortega out of the tub.''
   ``We know that Bush is a cowboy on the subject of Nicaragua,''
said Birns. ``But it just doesn't make sense that he is going to
strap himself to a policy that has failed.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, a foe of Contra aid, said
after a post-election meeting with Bush that he was ``encouraged to
believe that there is a search for a policy that will be
acceptable'' both to the president-elect and Congress.
   On the Middle East, many experts contend that the Palestinian
uprising and other developments make the time ripe for more active
American diplomacy. Sol Linowitz, who was sent to the region as a
special envoy by President Carter, has suggested that Bush promptly
name another such emissary.
   Bush aides have said it is too early to make such a decision,
since the new administration's Middle Eastern policy is still being
formulated.
   Reagan last week authorized a ``substantive dialogue'' between
the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Bush
said he supported the decision.
   ``I think Bush will be committed to the future of Israel,'' Leach
said. ``He also, I think, recognizes it is unwise not to listen to
all sides. I think you'll see someone in the White House who
understands more of the subtleties of the Middle East than we've had
in recent years.''
   Bush traveled to Israel, Egypt and Jordan in 1986 in a trip
billed at the time as a mission to spur the peace process.
   On other issues, Leach said, ``I look for progressive arms
control, I look for a much more effective and principled use of
international organizations like the United Nations. He set a little
more moderate agenda in the environment, in education, in day care.''

   The winter solstice is nearly upon us again, an
event long celebrated as marking the triumph of the unconquered sun
but today more often dreaded as the start of winter.
   Overshadowed in this season of religious holidays and the
approaching new year, the solstice was once the most popular of
pagan celebrations.
   It marks the lowest point of the year for the sun's apparent
travel, occurring at 10:28 a.m. EST, on Dec. 21, according to the
U.S. Naval Observatory.
   After the solstice, the sun begins spreading its warming rays
farther and farther north until reaching a zenith at the summer
solstice in June.
   Primitive societies, fearing the sun's departure, often developed
complex folk tales about the change in seasons, and learned to
celebrate the winter solstice as a time of rebirth foreshadowing the
coming return of summer.
   Indeed, sociologists note that many aspects of this event were
incorporated into Christian festivities marking the birth of Jesus,
which is now a major event of this season.
   To residents of ancient Rome the season was known as Saturnalia
and was celebrated with raucous merrymaking. That has since been
generally toned down, or at least postponed until New Year's eve.
   The Germanic tradition called Yule remains popular in many areas,
however. That feast incorporated burning of a special yule log,
decorating with plants such as holly, ivy and mistletoe which were
thought magical, and drinking wassail toasts.
   Gail Cleere of the Naval Observatory reports that great bonfires
were lit atop hills in hopes of encouraging the return of the sun.
   Today, most calendars list this date as the start of winter
despite the fact that there are no ``official'' definitions of the
seasons.
   Meteorologists, for example, consider winter to begin Dec. 1. In
medieval times Nov. 23 was considered that season's beginning, and
most people simply judge winter's arrival by how cold they feel when
they go outdoors.
   At any rate, the coming months mark the coldest time of the year
thanks to the fact that, although the sunlight is gradually
increasing, it takes some time to overcome the cooling that has been
underway during autumn when the light was on the decline.
   That thermal lag notwithstanding, spring will come, to be
welcomed by those following medieval tradition on Feb. 22, by
meteorologists on March 1, by calendar makers on March 20 and by
most folks on the first balmy day.

   A man hijacked a limousine carrying a bride-to-be
and her bridesmaids, but he dropped the screaming women off at the
church just in time for the ceremony and then sped off.
   The wedding came off more or less as planned, and sympathetic
police officers drove the bride and groom to their reception.
   Although the hijacker and the limousine were not recovered,
police may have a good shot at finding him: one of the bridesmaids
snapped a farewell photo of the abductor.
   The saga began when Sharon McEachern, two of her bridesmaids, the
maid of honor and a friend from Florida arrived early for the 11:15
a.m. Saturday wedding at St. Mark's Church in Boston. The priest,
the Rev. William Devine, suggested they take a quick drive in the
limousine.
   The bride was nervous, and her throat was dry, so she asked the
limousine's chauffeur, William Spitz, to pull over at a convenience
store to buy a soda. Spitz obliged.
   While he was in the store, a man hopped in the limousine, said he
needed the car, and drove away with the bride and her friends inside
screaming and begging to be let out.
   ``I was in the front seat with him,'' said Lisa Ferguson, the
friend from Florida, who described the man as in his 30s, blond and
wearing a red ski hat. ``He just said, `Excuse me girls, but I need
this car.' He kept apologizing, but he said he had to get away from
the police.''
   The man also took $20 and a personal check for $25 from the women.
   The women managed to persuade their captor to drop them at the
church. As a parting shot, Ferguson yelled, ``Smile,'' and snapped
his picture as she fled the limousine.
   McEachern and Timothy Moccia were married, but since there was no
limousine to escort them to the reception, Boston police volunteered
their cruisers.
   ``The bandit got them to the church on time, but the police got
them to the reception on time,'' Detective Walter Fahey said proudly.
   At the reception, the groom's brother offered a toast: ``I hope
your married life is a lot smoother than the ride to get here.''
   The couple will spend their honeymoon in the Bahamas.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Climbers who set out to scale the cliffs at a new
gorilla exhibit in the Franklin Park Zoo were trying to prove it
couldn't be done.
   But they did it, despite a lack of places to grip and a tough
overhang.
   Officials at the $26 million African tropical forest exhibit said
they wanted to establish that the zoo's gorillas would be unable to
reach the peak of the cliffs and thereby gain access to the public
area of the innovative animal display.
   ``The gorilla has shorter legs and longer arms and he's much
stronger,'' said project manager Walter Kilroy of the Metropolitan
District Commission, which operates the zoo.
   ``This is a fairly strong test of the rocks,'' he added,
``because gorillas can't really problem-solve the way humans can.''
   Climber Richard Doucette said he had had a tough time reaching
the exhibit summit. ``The rocks lack features (places to grip) and
the overhang is what kills you,'' he said.
   Zoo officials said some niches would be filled in to prevent
climbers _ human and primate _ from gaining a grip.
   The exhibit, scheduled to open in September 1989, was designed to
portray animals in their environment rather than in cages, Executive
Director Mark Goldstein said.
   ``You and I grew up with zoos where the elephants were in one
cage and the lions were in the next cage. We learned about animals
in these cubby holes,'' he said. ``But instead of this being a
species building or a Noah's Ark, you will be experiencing a piece
of an African forest.''
   In addition to gorillas, the state-funded complex includes plenty
of tropical vegetation, streams and waterfalls, 25 species of birds,
fish, leopards, insects, crocodiles and antelope.

   Seventeen-year-old Arnel Galang still
wakes up screaming, haunted by the faces of the 23 relatives he lost
a year ago when the ferry Dona Paz sank with more than 3,000 people
aboard.
   Arnel, then a high school senior, was one of only 26 passengers
and crew who survived after the 2,215-ton Dona Paz collided with the
629-ton oil tanker Vector and exploded off Mindoro island the night
of Dec. 20, 1987.
   A presidential commission said at least 3,563 people were aboard
the two ships, but the precise figure may never be known. Only 108
bodies were recovered after the disaster, which the coast guard
blamed on the Vector.
   For Arnel, the year has been one of bitterness and pain. He feels
abandoned by a government that he says has done little to help him.
   Family members blame Arnel for not saving his relatives,
including cousins, aunts and an infant niece, who perished on the
Dona Paz.
   ``Everything that happened is still clear to me,'' he said, his
hands trembling. ``Sometimes, I can't sleep. Sometimes, I get
nightmares. I shout and cry, then I stay awake all night. In my
dreams, they tell me they have not died, only wandered off to an
unknown place. But I have to face reality. I just pray for them.''
   Arnel and his relatives boarded the Dona Paz to go to Manila to
visit his sister, Rose, whom he hadn't seen since childhood. It was
his first time on a ship.
   Suddenly, about 10 p.m., he felt a strong thud.
   He ran for a wall and squeezed himself through a porthole.
   ``I struggled free and fell into the water,'' he recalled. ``I
couldn't hear anything anymore. There was just silence. The sea was
on fire. My face was scalded. The water was very hot as if it were
boiling water. I swam so fast. I don't know how I did it.''
   Arnel and the other survivors were rescued by a passing ship and
brought to Manila. There, he saw Rose. Burned and bandaged, he raced
to embrace her.
   But the joy of reunion soon gave way to resentment. Relatives
blamed him for not saving other family members.
   ``They ask me `Arnel, Why did you not save your cousins?''' he
said, fighting back tears. ``I tell them,`There was nothing I could
do.' It was difficult enough saving myself. Maybe if I tried to save
them, we would all have died.''
   Since the disaster, Arnel said he has shunned other relatives,
including his parents, who live in Manila.
   Arnel is also bitter at the government, which he says abandoned
him. He received 5,000 pesos, or $250, which President Corazon
Aquino allocated for each survivor. But he said there has been no
psychological counseling or rehabilitation for the survivors.
   Mrs. Aquino recommended Arnel for a job in a pharmacy but the
company refused to hire him. His family is too poor to afford fees
to complete his final year of high school. He works as an unpaid
volunteer for an association of relatives of Dona Paz victims and
survives on charity.
   Arnel said he and some relatives of victims have refused to
accept a $1,500 lump sum payment from the shipowners, Sulpicio
Shipping Lines, because the company insists they sign a waiver
promising no further claims.
   In April, a group of survivors and relatives filed a class action
suit seeking more compensation. The case was dismissed and an appeal
is pending before the Supreme Court.
   In the meantime, Arnel is considering becoming a priest.
   ``When I think about the things I've gone through and am going
through, I think that maybe God wants me to be a priest and serve
him,'' he said. ``At this point, I have nothing else to lose and I
am ready to offer my life.''
   The sense of loneliness and abandonment is all the more painful
at Christmas.
   Last Christmas, five days after the tragedy, Arnel spent the day
crying in a corner of his parents' home, gazing out the window. This
year, he plans to spend the holiday alone.
   ``I can't bear to face them again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Forest Service: Overall, Timber Sales Make Money For Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of timber from government-owned forests
make money for the government overall although most forests lose
money, according to a new Forest Service study.
   The study, required by Congress because of years of disputes over
whether the sales in effect amount to government subsidies for
timber companies, was immediately attacked by a chief critic of the
sales who said the study would have found overall losses if proper
accounting practices were used.
   The current report covers the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1987,
and will be used to compile an updated version for the following
year and then a formal report to Congress for the current year.
   In a preface of the report addressed to ``Dear National Forest
User,'' Forest Service chief Dale Robertson said receipts from
timber sales in fiscal 1987 exceeded costs by $540 million.
   Roughly half that sum has to be returned to state and local
governments, leaving the federal government $267 million ahead from
the sales, the service said.
   The Wilderness Society, however, said in a statement the new
system ``greatly understates the costs of selling timber,'' thus
overstating any profits. The society said it believed proper
accounting would show a fiscal 1987 loss of $223 million and average
annual losses of $406 million from 1982 though 1987.
   The Forest Service study showed a pattern of frequent moderate
losses offset by large gains, notably from the productive forests of
the Pacific Northwest.
   The Forest Service region of Oregon and Washington accounted for
$460 million of the receipts over expenditures, 85 percent of the
total gain of $540 million. Put another way, Washington-Oregon had
$2.64 in revenue for every dollar of expense, while the system as a
whole had $1.76.
   Past studies have shown similar dominance by the Pacific
Northwest. A 1984 study by the General Accounting Office, covering a
period when timber prices were lower, said the Pacific Northwest
gains outweighed losses in all the remaining regions of the system.
   In the study, gains were reported in three other regions _
Arizona and New Mexico, $1.52 in revenue per dollar of cost;
California, $2.07 per dollar; and the Southeast, a region that
includes Texas and Oklahoma, $1.62.
   All other regions lost money: Montana, North Dakota and northern
Idaho, 88 cents of revenue per dollar expense; Rocky Mountains
(eastern and central Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska and
Kansas), 56 cents; western Wyoming, southern Idaho, Utah and Nevada,
57 cents; Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and states to the east north of
the Ohio and Potomac rivers, including West Virginia, 87 cents;
Alaska, 25 cents.
   The harvest of 12.7 billion board feet of timber generated more
than 139,000 jobs in affected communities and $3.83 billion in
income, including rents and returns on investments, the service said.
   The timber sales also produce other benefits that cannot be
assigned monetary values, including ``sustained yields of various
wildlife habitat to support a variety of species, reduced forest
protection costs, reduced probability of catastrophic fires,
increased visual diversity and watershed improvements.''
   The Wilderness Society statement said 76 of 120 forests lost
money, in part because the service assigns too little cost to
road-building.
   ``One bookkeeping trick that the Forest Service uses is to
amortize the costs of roads and bridges over the entire interval
between timber harvests. For example, in the Rocky Mountains road
costs are spread out over a period ranging from 122 to 331 years.''
   This means only a tiny fraction of road-building costs are
charged against timber receipts in a given year, while private
companies would recover those costs in 20 to 30 years.

   When it comes to holiday giving, every town has its Santas and
Scrooges, but some communities seem to have an abundance of one or
the other this year.
   With a week to go before Christmas, charities are reporting mixed
results. Donations are up or holding their own in some places and
down in others, according to checks with the Salvation Army, the
United Way, Catholic Charities, the Red Cross, food banks and other
groups.
   Efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia
appear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities, the
charities say.
   There seems to be no pattern: collections are up in big cities
like New York and Chicago, but down in Los Angeles. In the Midwest,
Kansas City and St. Louis reported healthy donations, while Oklahoma
City was having a more difficult time.
   Nor was a strong economy necessarily a sign of success: Donations
were up in Boston, but those in neighboring Rhode Island were
struggling to stay even.
   Local factors account for some of these differences, such as
shopping malls that ban Salvation Army kettles. Others have to do
with the weather, competition among charities, the local economy, a
shortage of bell ringers and a shift of donations earlier this year
into campaign coffers.
   Charity officials in Boston credit their success to a more
sophisticated approach to hat-passing as well as seasonal good will.
   ``There seemed a tendency to give more and we also broadened our
base by going to more people. A lot of people don't give because
they haven't been asked,'' said Wallinda Hudson, spokeswoman for the
United Way of Massachusetts Bay, which raised $48.7 million in
pledges for its 1988 campaign, up 10 percent over 1987.
   It's a different story in Arizona, where charities say an
economic downturn is behind a decline in giving. Paul Curnow, the
Salvation Army's development director in Phoenix, cites a 12 percent
to 25 percent drop.
   The story is much the same in Detroit and Newark, N.J. Giving is
down by at least $60,000 from last year for the Salvation Army in
Detroit. Thelma Cloude, director of the Greater Newark Social
Services and Correction Bureau, said, ``This year, with the
upsurgence of the working poor, those who used to help us now need
help themselves.''
   Other areas are suffering from a dearth of volunteer or low-paid
donation-collectors _ ironically a result of a strengthening economy
that has more people working, charity officials say.
   In Rhode Island, which has an unemployment rate of 3 percent, the
Salvation Army Corps of Providence is hurriedly trying to recruit
volunteers, said Capt. John E. Wettlaufer. ``For a full-timer, we
have one woman that works every day and she's 86 years old, God
bless her,'' he said. College students have pitched in on weekends.
   In Georgia, with more volunteer bell ringers than ever, Salvation
Army officials said kettle donations are up by 15 percent. However,
mail donations are off by 6 percent.
   For fund-raisers in Southern California, the campaign drain has
been the problem.
   ``The fact of the matter is that we usually suffer every four
years when there's an election,' said Russell Prince, the Salvation
Army development director in Southern California, where donations
are running 15 percent behind last year.
   In Richmond, Va., Salvation Army officials blame a drop at the
kettles on cold weather and shopping mall managers who barred the
bell-ringers.
   Americans' response to the Armenian earthquake was viewed as
having an impact on domestic giving in some cities, such as Detroit.
   ``People that give to that (Armenia) seem to dig a little deeper.
It hasn't affected our income,'' said Don Payton, director of
development for the Salvation Army in Denver, who estimated that
donations were running 6 percent to 8 percent above 1987.
   The Red Cross' Southeast Michigan chapter faces a bittersweet
situation, spokesman Mark Cornillie said.
   ``A lot of people are converting their gifts to Armenia, and in
that case, we absorb the cost of handling that money. So not only
are we losing money that people traditionally give to us at this
time of year, but we're losing it in the administration end,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, the need for assistance keeps growing, spokesmen say.
A program to provide toys, coats and food for needy families in the
Newark, N.J., area had 1,600 families request aid this year, double
last year's total, said Ms. Cloude.
   While the amount of goods donated to the South Central
Pennsylvania Foodbank in suburban Harrisburg is about the same as
last year, the demand for food from its 300 participating agencies
has increased, said Assistant Director Jodie Morris.
   But officials retain faith in Americans' willingness to respond
to need. ``When people see people in need, and they see an
opportunity to help, they will,'' said national Red Cross
spokeswoman Barbara Lohman.

   A fire swept through a downtown
residential hotel Sunday morning , killing at least one person,
authorities said. Sixteen people were unaccounted for.
   The fire in the four-story Morningside Hotel apparently began on
the third floor and quickly spread. One wall collapsed. The hotel
has 105 rooms, housing transients and some long-term residents, and
was built in 1924.
   About 100 evacuees were moved to a nearby church. Robert Ziker,
the hotel's owner, said resident Julius Wood died in his
fourth-floor apartment.
   Of the residents who were unaccounted for, authorities said it
was possible they were not home at the time.

<HEAD>Bush Plans Own Ethics Bill in Wake of Troubled Reagan
Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, entering the White House
on the heels of an administration bedeviled by ethics accusations
against senior personnel, plans to move quickly on his own ethics
bill early next year, aides say.
   Although Bush supported President Reagan's pocket veto of ethics
legislation that Congress passed this year, he intends to put forth
a package that will include some of the same elements, said the
president-elect's legal counsel, Boyden Gray.
   ``We've already started very preliminarily to put our thoughts
together on it. The anticipation is that we will have a bill late
this winter, early spring,'' Gray said in an interview.
   During the campaign, Bush walked a careful line to avoid direct
criticism of former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who was under
investigation by an independent counsel, while trying to signal that
his own administration would hew to high ethical standards.
   Independent Counsel James McKay later declined to prosecute
Meese, but concluded that the former attorney general probably broke
federal conflict-of-interest laws twice by handling matters
affecting the telecommunications industry at the time he held
telephone stock.
   In a news conference last week, Bush promised to carry through on
his campaign pledge, saying, ``I will have ethics legislation. I
spoke about it in the campaign, my commitment to high ethical
standards and I will have proposed legislation go up very, very
early.''
   Gray said drafting has not begun. He has not specifically
discussed proposed ethics legislation with the Justice Department
yet, but said his staff has held preliminary talks with
representatives from the Office of Government Ethics.
   Gray said Bush intends to include some planks that were not in
the legislation Reagan vetoed last month, including applying the
same restrictions to members of Congress as those that apply to
executive branch employees who leave government.
   The congressional legislation only banned lobbying activity for
one year for people who left Congress, but imposed a lifetime ban in
some circumstances for executive branch employees. Bush has
supported a one-year ban on congressional lobbying by former members
of Congress.
   The complaint of the Reagan administration, in which Bush serves
as vice president, was that the 1988 congressional bill imposed far
more restrictive rules on executive branch employees.
   In vetoing the bill, Reagan said he considered it ``excessive and
discriminatory,'' and said it would hamper good people from entering
the government.
   Administration officials criticized the bill because it forbade
former executive branch employees not only from lobbying their
former division but also aiding or advising clients on dealings with
that division.
   That aiding and advising clause, which was a lifetime ban, will
be left on the cutting room floor of the Bush proposal, Gray said.
   More than 100 officials in the Reagan administration have been
accused of wrongdoing, and at least six, including former Deputy
Chief of Staff Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger, Reagan's former
political director, have been convicted.
   Bush has promised to set up a White House ethics office, with a
permanent ethics office in each government department and agency.
   During his campaign, he pledged greater discretion for
prosecutors in pursuing civil and criminal sanctions, depending on
the gravity of the case, against those who violate
conflict-of-interest standards.
   He also said all blind trusts for government officials should be
managed by institutions rather than individuals.
   Gray said Bush also would consider the White House as one entity
for purposes of post-employment lobbying restrictions rather than
precluding people from lobbying only the section of the executive
branch where they worked.
   ``The compartmentalization of the executive office of the
president, I think, is something the vice president thinks is
somewhat artificial and ought to go,'' Gray said, ``because they
interact on such a daily basis.''
   In other words, a person would be barred from lobbying not only
the part of the White House where he or she worked, such as the
Office of Management and Budget, National Security Council or office
of the vice president, but would be restricted in contacts from all
White House sections.
   Gray said he also will try to push Bush's proposal for some
regulation on ``influence that people may wield before they leave
office,'' that could affect their post-government careers.
   ``The revolving door tends to focus almost exclusively on what
people can do after they leave,'' he said.
   But people can still make decisions involving companies that
might hire them after they leave government. Such post-government
employment would not necessarily involve lobbying their former
government agency, but in these cases, ``they've already done it,''
Gray said.
   ``I think it's a problem in the Pentagon. I think its a problem
in every department to a greater or lesser degree _ people
feathering their nest,'' he said.
   Gray said he has not yet sat down with Justice Department or
Office of Government Ethics officials to determine how regulations
to deal with that aspect might be worked out.

<HEAD>Radio Station `Sting' Nets 39 Arrests at Holiday Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grand prize was handcuffs and an
all-expenses-paid trip to the county jail in a bogus radio-station
promotion that netted 39 unsuspecting fugitives, police said Sunday.
   ``It went beautifully,'' Springfield Police Commander Dave Searcy
said a day after the ``sting'' operation lured the suspects to what
they thought was a holiday extravaganza arranged by radio station
WBTP.
   But the call letters stood for ``Wanted By The Police,'' and
those who showed up were arrested instead on charges ranging from
traffic offenses to burglary.
   ``They were allowed to party for a half-hour with drinks and
everything,'' Searcy said. ``But everybody there, from Santa Claus
to the elves to the clowns, were cops. In some cases, we were
entertaining their kids while other cops were booking them.''
   Promotional letters from the phony radio station were sent to the
last known address authorities had for 545 fugitives in a
three-county area around Springfield. The scheme was hatched by the
Sangamon County Sheriff's police several weeks earlier.
   Recipients of the letters were promised a $500 gift certificate
and a chance to win a $2,000 shopping spree at area stores in a
drawing scheduled for Saturday morning at the Prairie Capitol
Convention Center.
   But to claim the prizes, winners had to show up in person at what
was billed as a holiday promotion at the center.
   ``We took them out one by one to get their surprises,'' Searcy
said, ``and they were surprised all right.
   ``One woman kept laughing and saying, `You're not serious.' When
we told her we were, she started crying. Another guy kept saying, `I
knew it, I just knew it.' But that didn't stop him from showing up.''
   Of the 39 arrests, 12 were for felony charges, 25 for
misdemeanors, and two for traffic offenses. One fugitive arrested
had been sought since 1984, Searcy said.
   About half had posted bond by midday Sunday, he added.
   ``We had only one minor snag. A man with the same name as his son
showed up. The mistake was found out right away,'' Searcy said,
``but needless to say, he was more than a little upset by the whole
thing.''

<TEXT>
   An Afghan guerrilla spokesman said
Sunday he was confident Moscow is ready to abandon its communist
protege in Kabul, President Najib.
   ``I believe the Russians know their puppet regime can't stay,''
Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla
alliance, told a news conference.
   ``They (the Soviets) don't want the present regime to be there,''
he said, referring to Najib and his ruling Marxist People's
Democratic Party of Afghansitan.
   Rabbani led a guerrilla delegation at high-level talks with
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov Dec. 3-5 in the Saudi
Arabian resort city of Taif. He said that at that meeting, Vorontsov
told guerrillas: ``We want a new system, a new situation.''
   Vorontsov and the guerrillas are expected to return to the
negotiating table in Islamabad before the end of the month, rebel
and Pakistani sources said.
   On Saturday, a low-level Soviet delegation met with Afghan
guerrillas, but the guerrillas said the talks concerned only
prisoner exchanges and ended without agreement.
   The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the
Marxist government. Last April, the Kremlin agreed to pull half of
its estimated 100,000 troops out by Aug. 15 and the rest by next
Feb. 15.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have been waging a war against the
Kabul government for the past 10 years. Their headquarters is in
Pakistan's frontier city of Peshawar.
   Rabbani said the guerrillas have demanded removal of the ruling
communists, reparation money, an end to Moscow's weapons aid to
Kabul and recognition of ``a government framed by the (rebels).''
   If the Soviets prove they share a commitment to peace, Rabbani
said, then the guerrillas will guarantee Red Army troops safe
passage out of the country.
   ``The mujahedeen will not create any obstacles on their way out''
provided the Soviets give them advance knowledge of departing
troops, Rabbani said.
   The seven-party alliance has scheduled a meeting Monday to review
the Taif talks and hammer out a ``broad-based council'' that could
step into the breach in Kabul should the ruling communists abandon
the capital, Rabbani said.
   The council, he said, would include representation from different
segments of Afghan society with the exception of the Kabul
communists. However, the alliance has not agreed whether it would be
established through elections or by appointment, he said.

<TEXT>
   A city employee trying to lighten up City Hall
found out that her boss didn't appreciate her sense of humor.
   Water system clerk Betty Murphy was fired after she placed a sign
asking residents if they wanted to ``speak to the man in charge or
to the woman who knows what's going on.''
   Mayor Sharooz Jamie said he discharged Murphy, who is also the
elected city recorder, because he didn't think funny signs belonged
on the walls of City Hall.
   Murphy said Jamie never complained about the signs until recently.
   ``People bring them in and I put them up,'' she said last week.
``I've done it ever since I was elected'' last year.
   Murphy said she continued to put up notes on the front door of
City Hall after she lost her job Dec. 6 and was locked out of the
building. She said Jamie tore down one note saying she would be back
for her belongings, leading her to put up another note that said,
``I shall return.''
   ``City Hall is not a joking place,'' Jamie said. ``She must think
she's (General Douglas) MacArthur.''
   The recorder, who supervises city finances, has no office in City
Hall.
   Jamie and Murphy have often disagreed on city business, including
Murphy's initiative to remove a speed bump from a back street while
Jamie was out of town. She said the noise from cars was bothering an
elderly man who lived on the hill above it.
   Murphy has filed a lawsuit in Clay County Circuit Court to
determine whether she can be fired as water clerk.
   Jamie said Murphy would continue to serve as recorder. ``I don't
have any problem with working with her,'' Jamie said.
   Clay, which has a population of about 500, is about 30 miles
northeast of Charleston.

<HEAD>South African Soldiers Kill Black Policemen In Bungled Ambush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African soldiers hiding
out in what they believed was a guerrilla safe house shot and killed
two black policemen and an alleged informer who approached the
building, police said Sunday.
   The victims also believed the building was a base for the
outlawed African National Congress and were arriving to investigate,
police said.
   The ambush in the Soweto township occurred on Wednesday but was
not reported by police or the army until Sunday newspapers described
it.
   Police refused to say if weapons were found in the house or
identify the owner. The Sunday Times quoted a neighbor, Richard
Gondolwane, as saying: ``I didn't know my neighbors well as they had
only lived there for a short time.''
   After being tipped off by an unidentified informant, soldiers hid
inside the house Wednesday, according to the reports.
   About the same time, four policemen, three black and one white,
were told by the alleged informer that the house was occupied by ANC
members, police said. They went to investigate and were shot as they
approached the house at night, according to police headquarters.
   The Sunday Times reported that they victims were fired upon after
they broke down the door of the darkened home and burst inside.
   The soldiers, believing they were firing at ANC members, killed
two black policemen and the alleged informer and injured the third
black policeman. The white officer was not hurt, police said.
   The policy of having white South African soldiers on duty in the
black townships is a controversial one.
   Anti-apartheid organizations have made removal of the soldiers a
major demand, and the situation has been an issue in trials of draft
resisters who say it is inappropriate for white soldiers to be
called to perform military service in neighborhoods where their
fellow black citizens live.
   It was not clear whether the soldiers involved in the shooting
were career officers or young draftees performing their mandatory
two years of service.
   ``If the soldiers were national servicemen, it was extremely
reckless to use young men who obviously have not had the training
for action of this sort,'' said Helen Suzman, a Parliament member
from the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party.
   ``This is another good reason for not sending the army into the
townships and for only using men who are properly trained.''
   Under apartheid, blacks have no vote in national affairs and have

   A car bomb detonated by remote control
exploded as three police vans drove through this Basque town Sunday,
killing one officer and injuring six officers and nine civilians,
police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but police blamed it
on Basque separatists, who took up arms in 1968 in an effort to gain
independence for the three Basque provinces in northern Spain.
   The car bomb exploded as the vans were driving toward Ipurua
stadium, where the police officers were assigned to help maintain
order at a soccer match.
   The game was canceled after the explosion, which damaged two of
the vans and killed policeman Jose Antonio Barrado. It also injured
six officers and nine passersby, damaged parked cars and smashed
windows in nearby buildings.
   Police blamed the Basque separatist group ETA, the initials for
the words Basque Land and Liberty in the Basque language. ETA has
claimed responsibility for the killing of 17 people, mostly police
and soldiers, so far this year.
   On Nov. 23, ETA detonated a car bomb near the headquarters of the
paramilitary civil guard in Madrid that killed two people and
injured 44.
   On the same day, Basque separatists set off three bombs in and
around the city of Bilbao, damaging three French cars dealerships
but causing no injures.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
since 1968.

   When poor pupils at a small school on an
Indian reservation wrote Santa Claus asking for pencils and
notebooks, touched postal workers responded by buying the children
more than 150 gifts.
   ``They weren't asking for things like computers and Nintendo
games,'' said Twila Fairtrace, secretary to the West Palm Beach
postmaster. ``These letters were different because they were asking
for the basics. Most of them asked for school supplies.''
   Fairtrace, who during the Christmas season reviews letters to
Santa, told co-workers about the 21 letters from Ahfachkee School on
the Big Cypress Indian Reservation. About 60 workers then raised
money for gifts for the school's 48 pupils.
   Gift-wrapped presents delivered to the children Friday included
pencils, pens, notebooks and reams of paper, as well as clothing and
toys.
   ``What really got to me,'' postal worker Dawn Haugen said, ``was
when one little girl was telling some others, `Look what I got! I've
got pencils and paper and crayons and glue and everything!'''
   When a kindergartener hugged post office ``elf'' Joann
Goodbridge, the woman was so overcome with emotion she ran behind a
van used to deliver the gifts.
   ``When that little girl threw her arms around me, I just lost
it,'' Goodbridge said. ``I couldn't help crying.''
   Tom Bernos, assistant principal at the south-central Florida
school, said the little girl has 15 brothers and sisters.
   Postal workers said the project boosted morale.
   ``I walked into work, and everybody's there early, on their own
time, wrapping presents,'' said employee John Nasipak. ``We're
thinking about seeing if we can't make this an annual project, using
different schools in needy neighborhoods.''

   During the month of December, Mistletoe
Postmaster A.B. Couch said he handles twice as much mail as he does
all the rest of the year.
   ``They send it here to get the `Mistletoe' postmark on it,''
Couch said. ``I don't count the mail, but I suppose about 500 pieces
came in this morning.''
   The mail arrives by the only route to the tiny post office _ a
twisting, six-mile gravel road.
   ``The story goes that the post office got its name because trees
on the surrounding hills were full of mistletoe,'' said Couch, the
postmaster since 1969. ``That bad winter of 1977 about wiped it out,
though.''
   There isn't much in Mistletoe besides an abandoned Presbyterian
church, some barns and Couch's wood-frame house.
   Inside the house, the kitchen is to the right, the U.S. Post
Office to the left.
   Until December, Couch and his assistant postmaster _ his wife of
22 years, Judy _ process about 2,300 pieces of mail for the 16
customers tucked among the Owsley County hills.
   But in December, mail from all over the country and several
foreign nations arrives at the post office, addressed to him.
Inside, Couch finds addressed, stamped envelopes, onto which he
stamps the coveted postmark and then mails the finished products
back out.
   Couch said he doesn't keep track of who sends what, so he's not
sure whether he has customers who mail to Mistletoe year after year.

   The 50-foot vaulted ceilings of a
section of Mammoth Cave helped Christmas carolers create an unusual
sound.
   ``You would think when you go down in a cave you'd get echoes,
but you don't,'' said Ron Wagner, musical director of the Mammoth
Cave Cavemen Barbershop Chorus. ``It's almost perfect down there.''
   The cave's acoustics, which in years past have attracted opera
stars, violinists and Shakespearean actors, surrounded the carolers
with a rich, resonant sound.
   ``It was very moving. It's kind of religious down here in the
cave,'' said Carolyn McNeill of Bowling Green.
   About 800 people, mainly residents from western Kentucky counties
surrounding Mammoth Cave National Park, attended the carroling
session Friday night 150 feet below the earth's surface.
   The event was inspired by an 1883 Christmas party thrown by
guests at the Mammoth Cave Hotel, said Mark Willis, special-events
coordinator for the park. That group decorated a cave room with a
cedar tree covered with ribbons, strung popcorn and sang carols by
the light of whale-oil lamps.
   The performers, including church choirs and area singing clubs,
took their turns on a natural stage of cave rubble.
   The performance, which lasted more than an hour, ended when the
singers led the crowd out of the cave in a candlelight procession.
   As they headed to the surface for cookies, hot chocolate and
apple cider, the group sang ``Silent Night.''

<HEAD>Tibetans Reportedly Stage Anti-Chinese Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 60 Tibetan students demonstrated Sunday
against China's policies in Tibet, where Chinese forces recently
killed at least one monk, an American journalist said.
   The journalist said he was the only Western reporter who
witnessed the demonstration and that police stopped him from talking
with students and shoved him into a police van.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said in a report late Sunday that
more than 70 Tibetan students had been persuaded not to stage the
demonstration at Tiananmen Square, the political center of Beijing.
   It said the students, from the Central Institute for
Nationalities, had not applied for permission to stage a
demonstration and were taken back to the institute by bus.
   Seth Faison, of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, said
five Chinese police officers pulled him away from the protesters,
picked him up and pushed him into the police vehicle.
   Faison, 29, of Brooklyn, N.Y., said he was questioned for two
hours and released.
   He was told he violated three city regulations: trespassing on a
public lawn, disturbing the flow of traffic and failing to follow
police instructions. Police told him he would not be charged with
the violations, Faison said.
   Faison said he saw about 60 people marching in western Beijing
shortly before noon. The marchers told him they were Tibetan
students.
   ``They are killing our people, they are killing our people,''
Faison quoted the marchers as saying.
   Pro-independence activists clashed with Chinese security forces
in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, on Dec. 10. Official Chinese reports said
one monk was killed and 13 people were injured when security forces
shot at the activists.
   Western witnesses said they saw two bodies, including a small
child, and that Tibetans told them seven people were killed.
   Faison said the marchers told him they had walked down
Changanjie, Beijing's main street, past Tiananmen Square and
Zhongnanhai, a walled compound housing offices and homes of some of
the country's highest-ranking leaders.
   Faison said he did not know whether any were arrested because he
was removed from the scene quickly. The Xinhua report did not
mention arrests.
   Tibetan activists seeking an end to 38 years of Chinese Communist
rule in Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama have demonstrated
repeatedly over the past 14 months in Lhasa. A small group of
Tibetans also marched in Beijing late last fall.
   At least 38 people were killed in violent clashes with police on
Oct. 1, 1987 and in March in Lhasa, Western travelers said.
   The Dalai Lama, whom Tibetan Buddhists believe is the
reincarnation of Tibet's protector god, led Tibet's civil
administration before Communist Chinese troops entered in 1950. He
fled to India in 1959 during an abortive anti-Chinese uprising.

   A wooden sailboat with 53 people
aboard sank in rough seas off a central Philippine island and 51
people were missing, the military said Sunday. Two people were
rescued.
   The report said big waves that buffeted the boat near Mindoro and
the smaller Semirara Island, about 170 miles southeast of Manila,
caused the sinking Friday of the inter-island sailboat Liplip.
   The survivors swam for seven hours before they were rescued by a
passing vessel, said the report from the armed forces headquarters.
   It did not say if the survivors were among the six crewmen or
were passengers. The report said all the passengers were from
neighboring Panay Island, but it did not say where the boat was
headed.
   Rescue teams were searching for more survivors, it said.

<HEAD>Eddy Shah's New Newspaper Folding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Eddy Shah, who led the way into high-tech
newspaper production in Britain, is giving up his new national
tabloid, The Post, and has sold his 20-paper provincial chain, news
reports said.
   The Press Association, the domestic news agency, reported
Saturday that Shah, 44, was closing the 5-week-old newspaper.
   The Sunday Times said he has decided to leave the newspaper
business. ``I don't enjoy newspapers,'' it quoted him as saying. ``I
was never interested in the content of my papers or understood what
makes a good newspaper.''
   The Post was launched Nov. 10 with three editions and an initial
print run of 1.1 million. It was thought the paper needed to sell
370,000 copies a day to break even but last week was reportedly
selling about 100,000 copies a day.
   The Post was Shah's second attempt to start a national newspaper.
   The first one, the fully computerized Today, was launched in
March 1986 and with its low production costs and advertising rates
forced Fleet Street _ London's newspaper row _ into the electronic
age.
   But within three months Shah had given up control and eventually
sold out. Today is now run by Rupert Murdoch's News International,
which publishes the Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun _ the
country's biggest-selling newspaper.
   In an agreement signed Saturday, Shah sold 20 provincial
newspapers in Manchester, Cheshire and Lancashire, his entire
Messenger@Guardian chain, to publishing giant Reed International,
giving that group 109 regional papers.
   The Post's chief reporter, Charles Rae, said the paper had
printed its last edition and would shut down if a buyer were not
found.

   Thieves broke into a church's storage
room, picked through almost 2,000 toys that were donated for the
poor and made off with the best of them, authorities said.
   ``What they took was the new stuffed animals, the doll babies,
the trucks,'' said Barbara Zahner, executive director of Sacred
Heart Church's Community Services. ``They left us the used toys.''
   The toy giveaway Monday is aimed at helping boost the morale of
poor parents. The 1,000 parents who registered for it can browse
through the storage room to make their selections, and receive
wrapping paper and ribbons to decorate the packages.
   ``The idea is they can come and shop with dignity,'' Zahner said
Friday. ``There's no money exchanged, but they can choose.''
   The storage room is in a building used by at least seven social
service agencies. Zahner said two men were seen walking down the
hall with full plastic garbage bags Thursday night, but no one paid
much attention to them.
   There were no signs of forced entry, so Zahner said she suspects
the thieves may have had a key to the building.
   The giveaway is still set for Monday.
   ``We'll just count on the goodness of people who realize that
this is the season of the child,'' Zahner said.

   A man working as a shopping mall
Santa Claus was arrested on charges that he fondled teen-age girls
while they were having their pictures taken with him.
   Police said Donald Strong, 44, of Crawfordsville was charged
Thursday with sexual battery after he allegedly fondled the young
women, aged 15, 16, 17 and 18, at Boulevard Mall.
   Mall manager Kevin B. Garleb said Strong has previous convictions
on burlgary and theft charges. He would not comment on the sexual
battery charges, but defended his hiring of Strong.
   ``Past charges of burglary do not mean that you would be a
possible threat for a sexual crime,'' Garleb said.
   Detective Lt. Rick D. Wilson said Strong was arrested while he
was off duty.
   The young women did not report the alleged fondlings, but a
policeman overheard other shoppers talking about the allegations.
   ``I think there were several reasons why they did not report the
incidents immediately. Like victims of other sexual crimes, they
were afraid of the embarrassment and publicity,'' Wilson said.

   Only the most ruthless of robbers would steal the
Grinch who stole Christmas.
   But steal him they did _ until their consciences caught up with
them.
   A pair of Northeastern University students who identified
themselves only as Ebenezer Scrooge and Kriss Kringle on Saturday
returned the 6-foot green Grinch they had pinched two days earlier
from Boston's downtown Quality Inn.
   ``Initially we were going to hold the Grinch for a large
ransom,'' the pair said in a note they left along with the
well-loved hater of Christmas. ``But ... we decided to return the
Grinch hoping the Quality Inn would donate $100 to the charity of
your choice in the names of myself and my partner and the Grinch.''
   Hotel spokeswoman Doris Pike said all was forgiven and that plans
were in the works to donate the money to Camp Joy, a recreational
therapy group for children with special needs.
   ``We threw a party today for about 65 kids from the group,'' Ms.
Pike said. ``They missed out on the Grinch, so they get the money.''
   According to the children's storybook by Dr. Seuss, ``The Grinch
That Stole Christmas,'' the dour green character makes off with a
town's Christmas decorations and presents after becoming enraged by
the sounds of Christmas cheer. But the Grinch relents and returns
the booty to Whoville.

   Although this town on the
Canadian border bills itself as the ``Nation's Icebox,'' it can't
truly compete for the world title.
   So, says Mayor Jack Murray, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
   Murray hopes to set up a sister-city relationship with the
Siberian village of Verkhoyansk, which, according to a history of
the region, has recorded temperatures as low as 90 degrees below
zero.
   ``I just thought it would be good public relations and some good
publicity to go with things we're doing here,'' said Murray, whose
city is trying to further promote itself as a cold-weather testing
site for products ranging from clothing to car batteries.
   That's even though its record low is a mere 46 degrees below zero.
   International Falls is trying to make contact with Verkhoyansk
through Paul Mala, a specialist in cold-weather research from
Anchorage, Alaska, who is attending a conference in Leningrad.
   While there, Mala plans to meet representatives from the Siberian
region where Verkhoyansk is located, and give them a packet from the
International Falls Chamber of Commerce.
   The plan is for Verkhoyansk's residents to somehow get the
documentation of their sister-city relationship to Anadyr, a
Siberian city on the Pacific Coast. There it will be picked up by
arctic explorer Paul Schurke, who plans a 1,200-mile dog-sled
journey March 1 that will end in Alaska.
   The documents, Schurke said Friday, would then be carried by car
to International Falls.

   Freed hostage Peter Winkler, returning home Sunday,
said he has a greater desire to be a relief worker despite his
abduction while working in Lebanon and month in captivity.
   The Red Cross delegate told reporters in Geneva that he spent
much of his days thinking ``about my life, my work for the Red
Cross, which I would like to continue. But I fear it will not be
again in Lebanon.''
   But he said he was ``even more motivated now to work for the Red
Cross.''
   Winkler, 32, said his captors never identified themselves or told
him why they kidnapped him Nov. 17 in the city of Sidon, where he
directed operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Winkler, freed Friday in Sidon, said he was treated well but was
``very much afraid.''
   The former hostage smiled when he stepped down from a Cyprus
Airways plane in Geneva before continuing to German-speaking
Switzerland to meet his parents.
   ``I went through moments of crisis which I have never gone
through before and which I hope I will never go through again,'' he
told reporters. He declined to elaborate, saying, ``It's too
personal.''
   Winkler said he did not know whether his release might mean that
other hostages also would be freed.
   Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber said Saturday that Winkler's
abductors tried to make his release conditional on a lenient
sentence for a jailed Lebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker held in
Switzerland, which refused to make any concessions.
   Hussein Hariri, 22, hijacked an Air Afrique plane to Geneva July
14, 1987, and killed a French passenger before he was subdued and
arrested. He is to go on trial Feb. 20 and faces a maximum sentence
of life in prison if convicted.
   Winkler said his captors ``dictated word for word'' his
handwritten note early this month. It said in English, ``My
government knows what my kidnappers want from it, and it has to
cooperate in order to save my life.''
   The Swiss foreign minister said the kidnappers identified
themselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group calling
itself the ``Organization of Socialist Revolution.''
   Winkler said he was kept in solitary confinement, but did not
know where. He said he never saw the faces of his captors, who were
either masked or blindfolded.
   During the captivity, he was able to listen to news broadcasts by
the British Broadcasting Corp. and Radio Monte Carlo, Winkler said.
He also had a Bible and four English- and French-language books,
including Marcel Pagnol's ``The Time of Secrecy.''
   ``I did not manage to finish it,'' he added, laughing.
   Red Cross spokesman Carlos Bauverd said its policy was never to
send a delegate back to a region where he or she had a ``problem.''
Winkler was the first International Red Cross delegate to be taken
hostage.
   Bauverd said the Red Cross would ``probably'' resume operations
in south Lebanon, which were stopped after Winkler's abduction. He
said the staff, which had been cut from 27 to 17, likely would be
increased.

   A man angry about the haircut he received returned
to the barbershop with a gun and killed the barber, police said.
   Robert Willis, owner of Barber Bob's Barber Shop in east Denver,
was shot about five times Saturday by a man whose hair he had cut
earlier in the day, shop customers said.
   One customer, who asked not to be identified, said Willis seemed
upset while he was cutting the suspect's hair and that the two
argued about the haircut after Willis finished.
   After the man left, Willis told his daughter and others that he
thought the man probably was high on crack and he feared that he
might return.
   Willis was on the telephone talking to police dispatchers when
the man returned with a semi-automatic handgun and shot him.
   ``It appears to have been a dispute over a haircut,'' said police
Sgt. Daniel Yount, who said the dispatchers heard the shots over the
telephone. Willis was dead when officers arrived.
   Witnesses said the suspect, last seen running from the shop, had
an almost clean-shaven head and a 3-inch, crescent-shaped scar on
the back of his head.

   A group of Americans that
spent a week in Soviet Armenia in the aftermath of a major
earthquake there returned home Sunday, speaking solemnly of the
devastation and admirably of the survivors.
   ``It's hard to put into words the absolute, total devastation of
the area,'' said Michael Tamillow, a member of the group, which
included 10 firefighters from Virginia, eight from Florida, eight
dogs trained to search for bodies, their 12 handlers and five
doctors.
   Tamillow said he was amazed at the resilience of the Armenian
people and credited Soviet troops with helping rescue workers from
the United States and other countries.
   ``The true heroes are the Armenian people,'' said Tamillow, a
firefighter from Fairfax, Va.
   Tamillow said subfreezing weather tested the mettle of the relief
workers.
   ``We were literally camping out over there in 20-degree
weather,'' he said. ``We were running low on water and we had no
firewood.''
   Tamillow said Soviet troops would visit the American base camp
nightly and bring firewood. Soviets and Americans often exchanged
stories and souvenirs, he said. ``We would give them candy and they
would give us things,'' he said.
   Tamillow was part of a team that assembled Dec. 9, two days after
the earthquake, at the request of the Office of Foreign Assistance,
an arm of the Agency for International Development.
   One of the returning doctors, Claude Cadoux of Chevy Chase, Md.,
said the physicians set up a makeshift hospital at an airport where
there also was a base camp for relief workers.
   The facility was designed to support the rescue operation but
also treated survivors of the earthquake, which killed an estimated
55,000 people and left an estimated 500,000 homeless.
   ``Once the people learned we were there they came to us for care
because of the overburden of facilities in the region,'' Cadoux said.
   Dr. Vartkes Najarian, an Armenian-American from Glendale, Calif.,
said residents of the earthquake-ravaged area were grateful for the
assistance of the dogs in searching through the rubble for survivors
and bodies.
   ``They started kissing and hugging the dogs and then they went
into their homes to bring food,'' Najarian said.
   About 30 Armenian-Americans from the Washington area were at the
base when the team returned and presented its members with gifts.
Family members and co-workers also were on hand for the arrival.
   Earlier Sunday, an Aeroflot flight carrying 20 kidney dialysis
machines and other medical supplies left Andrews for the Soviet
Union, according to the Armenian Relief Society, a group based in
Watertown, Mass. A separate plane carrying a medical team and
supplies left Newark, N.J., for the Soviet Union, the group said.

who said he bought the site in 1967 for $30,000. Somers would only
say that Lennon paid between $1 million and $2 million for the
property which has a gated road and a 360-degree view of the city.
   The original 2,400-square-foot bunker was camouflaged to look
like a home, including fake windows. Real windows were put in when
the bunker was later remodeled into a 4,000-square-foot house. The
secluded home also has a swimming pool.

   Actors Robert Morley and Robert Hardy were among a
host of stars who gathered at a West End theater Sunday for a
champagne tribute to Dame Gladys Cooper on the centenary of her
birth.
   The occasion was the opening of a Gladys Cooper bar at the
Playhouse Theater, which she managed between 1927 and 1933.
   Dame Gladys, who died in 1973 at 85, was one of the foremost
actresses of her generation. During World War I, she was Britain's
No. 1 pinup girl.
   In 1939, Alfred Hitchcock took her to Hollywood to play Laurence
Olivier's sister in ``Rebecca.'' Her other film successes included
``That Hamilton Woman,''``The Song of Bernadette,''``The White
Cliffs of Dover'' and ``Madame Bovary.''
   The Playhouse Theater now is run by novelist and former
politician Jeffrey Archer.
   Morley, 80, is married to Dame Gladys' daughter Joan; Hardy was
married to her daughter Sally.

   The mother of teen-age AIDS victim Ryan White
says an upcoming television movie about his story is ``excellent,''
but some residents of Indianan may not be looking forward to the
television portrayal.
   ABC's ``The Ryan White Story,'' starring Lukas Haas, is scheduled
to air Jan. 16.
   The movie includes a brief, cameo role by the 17-year-old. Ryan,
a hemophiliac who contracted AIDs through a blood transfusion in
1984, portrays an older hemophiliac friend who died of AIDS in real
life.
   The movie follows Ryan's lengthy legal battle to return to class
in Russiaville, southwest of Kokomo. The story ends by portraying
his first day at Hamilton Heights High School in Cicero, where the
family later moved.
   The Whites previewed the movie in Los Angeles in early November
and plan to attend two benefit screenings in Washington in January.
The Whites received $50,000 to $75,000 for the broadcast rights to
their story.

   FloJo, Bulldog and the Champ _ those are among
the personalities Americans will remember as the ``hot numbers'' of
1988, Life magazine says.
   In its January 1989 issue, Life looked back at the past year and
came up with these celebrities as the embodiment of '88:
   _Florence Griffith Joyner, 28, who ``hit the track scene like
fireworks, won three races and became the sensation of the Olympic
Games.''
   _Michelle Pfeiffer, 31, the actress who had hot roles in
``Married to the Mob,'' ``Tequila Sunrise'' and ``Dangerous
Liaisons.''
   _Tom Hanks, who starred in ``Big'' and ``Punchline.'' ``You can
bank on this,'' says Life. ``In April Hanks will play yet another
role, that of a 32-year-old winning his first Oscar.''
   _Orel Hershiser, 30, the Los Angeles Dodger who pitched with a
bulldog's tenacity for 59 scoreless innings in the regular season;
he then starred in the World Series and won the Cy Young Award.
   _George Michael, 25, the sexy pop singer whose debut album,
``Faith,'' became the first album ever to top all three of the pop,
adult and black charts.
   _Stephen Hawking, 46, a physicist who was given three years to
live when diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease 25 years ago; he hit
the best-seller charts with ``A Brief History of Time.''
   _Mike Tyson, 22, and Robin Givens, 24, whose heavyweight marital
difficulties dominated the scandal sheets for much of the year, even
as Tyson defended his boxing crown and Ms. Givens starred in
television's ``Head of the Class.''

<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia offered his resignation
as top leader of the governing party after he received a bitter
reception at his party's national convention, officials said Sunday.
   Garcia, Peru's president since July 1985, submitted a letter
placing his post as president of the Aprista Party at the
disposition of the party, Aprista said in a statement.
   Party official Ferdando Leon de Vivero issued a statement Sunday
afternoon saying the party would keep Garcia at its helm and that
party directors backed Garcia fully.
   In Garcia's letter, published in Lima newspapers Sunday, he said:
``I am no longer a man of triumph. I am an Aprista upon whom all the
insults fall. Without desiring it, others at my side can be hurt.''
   Critics accuse Garcia of implementing policies that have brought
on Peru's worst economic crisis this century and have failed to stop
the leftist Shining Path movement, whose eight-year guerrilla war
has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   The offer to resign referred only to Garcia's Aprista post and
not his position as the nation's president.
   The president's opening address to the convention in Lima Friday
night was marred by a shouting match between the 39-year-old
politician and many of the hundreds of party members in the
auditorium.
   It was the most strident opposition from within his party that
Garcia has faced since emerging as a leader of the center-left party
early in the decade.
   The opposition ``offends the nationalistic and popular image of
our party ... it serves to divides us,'' Garcia said in the
resignation document, which was delivered late Saturday to the 16th
National Congress of the Aprista Party.
   Garcia's reputation _ both within his party and outside _ has
plummeted in the face of the economic crisis.
   Political analysts say the economic woes also have severely
strained the country's fragile democracy. Rumors of a pending
military coup have surfaced repeatedly in recent months.
   Since Garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in Peru's
history in early September, some members of his own party have
demanded he resign as the nation's president. Others have called for
presidential elections to be stepped up by six months.
   Garcia's approval rating among Peru's 21 million people has
plunged from 96 percent during his first months in office _ he was
called the ``president of hope'' by many party members _ to 16
percent in late October, according to the respected polling firm
Apoyo.
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, named a candidate for president
Friday by the center-right coalition Democratic Front, has emerged
as one of Garcia's harshest critics.
   Most independent economists agree that Peru's current recession
is caused by runaway inflation expected to hit 1,800 percent this
year and by uncontrolled government spending.
   The next general elections are set for 1990, when Garcia's
five-year term ends.

   Dartmouth College and students the Ivy
League school punished for harassing a black professor go to court
Monday in a struggle between the administration and a conservative
off-campus newspaper.
   The students, former editors of the weekly Dartmouth Review, will
ask a judge to find enough merit to their claims that they are
victims of reverse discrimination to lift their suspensions
provisionally.
   John Sutter, 22, and Christopher Baldwin, 21, both white, were
suspended in March by a campuswide disciplinary panel. The panel
found the two guilty of disorderly conduct for failing to leave
Professor William Cole's classroom after being asked.
   The paper had called Cole's music class ``one of Dartmouth's most
academically deficient'' in an article that drew charges of racism
against the newspaper.
   A third student received a shorter suspension and a fourth got
probation for the February classroom clash with Cole.
   The Review's defenders say that had the students been black and
Cole white, the discipline would have been far less severe.
   Sutter, Baldwin, the third suspended student and the Review
charged in federal and state lawsuits that they were targeted for
being outspoken about their conservative views, which include
opposition to women's studies courses and affirmative action at
Dartmouth.
   The third student is not part of the hearing because he returned
to class this fall, said college spokesman Alex Huppe. The fourth
student did not join the lawsuits.
   ``The students were disciplined to such a severe degree that even
the college has no plausible explanation other than as a punishment
for the statements and articles in the newspaper, and that's a
violation of their freedom of expression,'' said Arthur Ruegger, a
lawyer representing the students.
   To Dartmouth, the issues involved are authority and autonomy.
   ``From the college's point of view, this is a private
discip| matter, and we're taking that extremely seriously,''
Huppe said Friday. ``We're obviously defending the college's
disciplinary procedures.''
   The hearing in Grafton County Superior Court is on bids by
Baldwin, of Hinsdale, Ill., and Sutter, of St. Louis, for a
preliminary injunction. If they win, they will return to Dartmouth
in January rather than in September, when their 18-month suspensions
expire, Huppe said.
   Though the hearing won't decide the core issues of the state
lawsuit, it will be an important first reading, Ruegger said.
   The Review's supporters include such prominent conservatives as
William F. Buckley Jr. and Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo., and
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H. Both senators attended a Washington news
conference in July to announce the lawsuits.
   Huppe said no First Amendment issues are raised directly in the
state case, which he said is based on contract law.
   But Ruegger said freedom of expression will be addressed because
it is guaranteed to students in Dartmouth's student handbook.
   Baldwin, who has worked at Buckley's National Review since being
suspended, was one of 12 students, mostly Review staffers, who
conducted a nighttime sledgehammer attack on shanties erected on the
college green in 1986 to symbolize the poverty of South African
blacks.
   The raid, coming hours after a service marking the birthday of
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., triggered a
semester of turmoil.
   In March, shortly after the college rejected appeals by Baldwin
and the other disciplined students, Dartmouth President James
Freedman called a special faculty meeting to denounce the Review for
``poisoning the intellectual environment of our campus'' and
threatening its ``moral endowment.''
   Freedman dismissed Review staffers as ``ideological provocateurs
posing as journalists.''

<HEAD>China Marks 10th Anniversary of Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang on Sunday
marked the 10th anniversary of a historic meeting that ushered in
China's economic reforms by saying the current ``crisis'' in Marxism
offers new opportunities.
   ``China is advancing and the world is changing,'' Zhao told about
400 scholars and party officials at a symposium honoring a major
Central Committee meeting held Dec. 18-22, 1978.
   ``Numerous problems are arising which call for answers to them.
Some people say this has posed `a crisis' for Marxism. Yet, in fact,
for Marxism, challenges mean new opportunities for development,''
the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Zhao as saying.
   Celebrations of the anniversary have been subdued as a result of
China's worst economic crisis since Deng Xiaoping took control in
1978, following the death in 1976 of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
   In September, the government called for a prolonged economic
slowdown, including a pullback on some reforms, to cope with an
inflation rate officially set at 26 percent, excessive government
spending and a breakdown of financial controls.
   Zhao told the symposium that China must closely examine present
conditions and learn from practice to develop Marxist theory. He
stressed the idea that the country will be in a primary stage of
socialism for the next century, and its main task is to advance the
productive forces.
   The 1978 meeting is regarded as a turning point in Chinese
history. Deng, a pragmatist who emerged as China's leader,
introduced his reforms at the meeting. He called for reorganizing
the economy, such as breaking up communes in favor of family
farming, and encouraging private initiative and market-oriented
economic principles. He also made clear that economic development _
not class struggle _ was China's top priority.
   In the past decade, Deng's reforms have doubled China's gross
national product and more than doubled personal incomes.
   But the official Guangming Daily, in an editorial on the
anniversary, said the tendency to try to achieve too much at one
time has caused policy makers to stray from the ``seeking truth from
facts'' concept emphasized by Deng at the 1978 meeting.
   ``They are problems in the process of advance and progress and so
long as we stick to the principles adopted at the historical plenum
we can overcome all these problems.''

<TEXT>
   The prince and princess of rival
tribes were married in a Christian ceremony Sunday that followed
three days of traditional festivities, including the ritual
slaughter of an ox.
   The marriage joined the royal households of South Africa's two
largest tribes, the Zulu and the Xhosa, and was noteworthy in a
nation where some whites believe blacks are incapable of cooperating
across tribal lines.
   Princess Nomusa Jeannett Bhekuzulu _ 25, the sister of the Zulu
king _ married Prince Maxhoba Sandile _ 40, the paramount-chief
designate of the Rarabes tribe of the Xhosas _ in the Bisho, the
capital of Ciskei.
   Ciskei is a Xhosa homeland that was designated as independent by
South Africa but that is not recognized by other nations.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, Ciskei President Lennox
Sebe and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini attended the wedding. The
Zulus have refused the government's efforts to make their territory
a separate nation.
   On Friday, Xhosa and Zulu women wearing beaded skirts, necklaces
and anklets danced and chanted in the mud and blood around a speared
ox.
   Tradition dictates that each time the ox is speared and does not
fall, the bridegroom's family must forfeit another goat to the
bride's household. So the Xhosa women waved straw switches at the
ox, urging it to die, while the Zulus held a mirror to its face so
it could see its fate and rise to its feet.
   The bridegroom and his men, wearing beads and wrapped in
blankets, entered the royal corral near the Ndakana Great Place,
where pieces of abdominal tissue of the sacrificial beast were
sprinkled with salt and buried.
   The bride and her bridesmaids, covered in blankets to keep their
faces hidden, entered the stockade. The bride plunged a spear into
the mud at the entrance, committing herself to the future of her
husband's home.
   On Sunday, about 4,000 people gathered in Ciskei's Independence
Stadium amid tight security to watch the Western-style, Christian
wedding ceremony performed by a minister of the Order of Ethiopia.
   Botha arrived on a Ciskei Defense Force helicopter and presented
the couple with a loaf of bread baked by his wife. He said they
should eat it together and remain together, calling the marriage ``a
sign of the future for southern Africa'' when all its inhabitants
could come together in peace and harmony.
   Local newspapers said the marriage was the first time royal
members of the historically antagonistic tribes had married.
   The Zulus and the Xhosas are the two largest tribes in South
Africa, each with more than 6 million, and each alone outnumbering
the whites who rule the country. The wedding could be significant
politically because of the belief by many Afrikaners, the Dutch
descendants who control the government, that South African blacks
cannot cooperate across tribal lines.

   Former presidential candidate Manuel J.
Clouthier entered the fourth day of a hunger strike Sunday and said
he will continue the fast until ``Mexico has a fair, honest
electoral law.''
   Clouthier was the candidate of the conservative National Action
Party in Jully 6 elections won by President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has
not lost a major election in its 59 years of rule.
   Both Clouthier and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who ran for a
left-of-center coalition and came in second in official results,
maintain there was widespead fraud in the election and vote count.
   ``Carlos Salinas de Gortari has formal but not moral authority to
govern the country,'' Clouthier told a news conference Saturday at
the tent where he is holding the hunger strike. ``What is needed
here is legitimacy.''
   He said he would continue the strike until ``Mexico has a fair,
honest electoral law that does not make one party privileged.''
   National Action said before Salinas' inauguration Dec. 1 that he
could acquire legitimacy by governing well and insuring the fairness
of elections. It also protested the results of state elections Dec.
4 in four states.

   Strangers passed the hat and raised nearly $100 for
two boys who returned a lost wallet containing $2,000 and received
only a $1 reward from the wallet's owner.
   ``Boy, did that guy make me mad,'' said John Bartolo, 35, a city
housing authority worker who raised the money Saturday after
learning of the small reward, which was reported in a newspaper. ``I
did it to make these kids feel better. I wanted to put the screws to
Ebenezer Scrooge.''
   The boys, Tommy Martel, 9, and Scott Senesi, 7, found the wallet
Thursday near their home in suburban Somerville, The Boston Herald
reported Sunday. The newspaper did not identify the wallet's owner.
   Bartolo said he enlisted some friends who went through several
bars, restaurants and a market to solicit donations for a more
fitting reward.
   Peggy Martel, Tommy's mother, said she was touched by what
Bartolo did.
   ``After talking with my husband and Scott's parents, we decided
to give the money to the kids because it will show them if they do a
good deed, they will be rewarded,'' she said.
   The boys said they found the brown wallet lying in the street and
took it immediately to Tommy's mother.
   ``I didn't even count the money, but I could see there were new
$100 bills,'' Mrs. Martel said.
   She tried to call the wallet's owner at his Medford home, then
found him at his job in Somerville.
   ``He looked everything over and said he had just come from the
bank with $2,000 and somehow dropped his wallet on the street. Then
he pulled out a dollar and handed it over for the kids,'' she said.
   ``I said, `You don't have to do that.' A nice thank you actually
would have been better than a dollar.
   ``But I don't want to put this man down. We don't know what his
circumstances are. The money wasn't ours to begin with, so giving it
back was the only thing to do.''

   Asian heroin valued at $7.5 million apparently
disappeared from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration regional
office, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   More than five pounds of heroin vanished in separate incidents in
1984 and 1985 after DEA agents seized the drugs as evidence, the Los
Angeles Times reported, citing unnamed sources close to a corruption
investigation.
   The probe has focused on the alleged corruption of former DEA
agents John Anthony Jackson, Darnell Garcia and Wayne Countryman,
who were indicted Dec. 7 on conspiracy and tax charges.
   Federal investigators, according to the newspaper, have linked
Jackson to the suspected theft of 2{ pounds of heroin from a DEA
vault in 1984.
   Jackson also participated in a 1985 heroin investigation in which
DEA undercover agents bought 15 pounds of heroin, but booked only 12
pounds as evidence, according to the same unnamed sources.
   Jackson, 39, who is being held without bail, declined a Times
request for an interview, the newspaper said. Attorneys representing
the three agents also declined to comment.
   Prosecutors have said the three DEA agents were tied to cocaine
trafficking and may have alerted Los Angeles drug kingpins to
federal investigations.
   However, the only charges filed so far against the former agents
involve an alleged plot to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and
making false statements on currency reports. The former agents
allegedly laundered more than $608,000 through Swiss bank accounts.
   Countryman, 45, was released after posting $120,000 bail; Garcia,
42, is a fugitive.

   More than 5,000 people demonstrated
outside the Biblis nuclear power plant Sunday to demand the closure
of the facility, where a recently disclosed malfunction took place
in 1987.
   About 170 groups participated in the demonstration, including the
environmentalist Greens Party and the West German Federation for
Environmental Citizens' Initiatives.
   Earlier in the day, police dragged 24 demonstrators out of the
plant's ``information center,'' which they had occupied overnight.
The two dozen protesters all were released but face possible charges
of disturbing the peace.
   During Sunday's demonstration, speakers repeated assertions that
a serious nuclear accident nearly developed at the Biblis plant, 30
miles south of Frankfurt, one year ago.
   Pressure for closing the Biblis plant erupted earlier this month
after a U.S. technical newsletter disclosed that on Dec. 16-17,
1987, operators there allowed a malfunctioning cooling system valve
to go uncorrected for 15 hours. A small amount of radioactive steam
escaped into the atmosphere during the incident.
   The company that runs the plant, Rheinisch-Westfaelisches
Elektrizitaetwerk, denies trying to conceal information about the
incident, and said it caused no damage to the public.
   Environmentalists charge that the accident could have led to a
nuclear core meltdown, but West German atomic officials say the
plant is outfitted with emergency systems that would have prevented
such an occurrence.

   A team of U.S. seismologists flew to the Soviet
Union Sunday to help rebuild cities shattered by Armenia's
earthquake, Tass said, as the Soviets turned their efforts from the
rescue of survivors to reconstruction.
   But Armenians ``whose senses have been dulled by grief'' continue
to hope more survivors can be found under collapsed homes and
apartment buildings, state-run Radio Moscow said 11 days after the
earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' said snow was forecast
Monday for Armenia, with temperatures as low as 9 degrees at night.
That would hamper relief workers trying to dig under the rubble and
pose more hardships for thousands of homeless now living under tents
and out of doors.
   ```We must hurry!' These words are now in the souls and on the
lips of thousands of people who are helping liquidate the
consequences of the tragedy,'' Tass said in a report on Sunday's
meeting of a special Politburo commission overseeing the relief
effort.
   The commission, which visited the stricken city of Spitak, said
the evacuation of children, women and the elderly from the disaster
zone was nearing completion, and that in two or three days, ``only
those who participate in rehabilitation work would remain.''
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported that in the first 10
days following the Dec. 7 quake, 15,252 people had been dug out
alive from the ruins of Armenian cities and villages, where an
estimated 500,000 people were left homeless.
   But judging from official media reports, attempts by Soviet and
foreign rescue teams to locate additional survivors in the shambles
of Leninakan, Spitak and other northwest Armenian cities crumbled by
the quake were becoming futile.
   Only one survivor was rescued in the 24-hour period ending
Saturday night, the Tass news agency said. During the same period,
89 bodies were extricated from the ruins.
   There were no reports Sunday of any more survivors.
   ``The first, most acute phase of the rescue effort is coming to
an end,'' Radio Moscow said. ``Preparations have started for
restoring the industries and housing.''
   Dutch television journalist Alexander Munninghoff, who returned
to Moscow Sunday from Spitak, said all foreign relief workers had
been asked to leave the city by Tuesday, apparently because the
search was ending.
   No official announcement has been made of an end to the search, a
potentially explosive issue in Armenia, where some people have sat
in front of bulldozers to prevent the clearing of debris until it
can be searched for victims.
   AP photographer Boris Yurchenko, who also was in Spitak, said the
city that was once home to 25,000 people was now nearly deserted,
with a few people searching for relatives remaining behind and
taking shelter in tin garages left standing by the quake.
   An estimated 15,000 people were killed in Spitak, and many
decomposing bodies still lie buried in ruined buildings.
   ``The smell is becoming more and more pronounced every day,''
Yurchenko said. ``The first sign of the terrible threat of an
epidemic _ dead dogs and swarming rats _ are forcing rescue teams to
hurry, since no leveling of the town can be done with corpses still
remaining in their stone graves.''
   Tass said 16 American seismologists were flying to the Soviet
Union Sunday, bringing specialists in the construction of
earthquake-resistant buildings and in the organization of rescue and
rebuilding operations.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has criticized the flimsy five-and
nine-story apartment buildings constructed in the 1960s and 1970s
that collapsed during the quake.
   Armenian activists, embittered by Moscow's refusal to grant their
demands in a territorial dispute with neighboring Azerbaijan, have
accused the central government of bungling relief efforts and not
doing enough to warn Armenians of the danger of an impending
earthquake.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who heads a special Politburo
commission overseeing the relief campaign, expressed frustration
with the ``unwelcome moods'' of some Armenians in comments broadcast
Sunday by Radio Moscow.
   Soviet media continued to report on an official crackdown against
Armenian militants, including members of the Karabakh committee, six
of whose leaders have been arrested.
   The committee has spearheaded the 11-month-old campaign for
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian district of
Azerbaijan.
   Tass said the Soviet Union has concluded an agreement with the
U.S.-based American Telephone and Telegraph Co. that will allow
Armenians to make collect calls to the United States, where many
have friends and relatives. Usually, Soviets cannot place collect
calls.
   Tass said that since the quake, telephone traffic between Armenia
and the United States has increased eight-fold.

   Two militiamen of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army were killed Sunday when a bomb planted by guerrillas
exploded at the militia's radio station, the station said.
   Islamic Resistance, a Lebanese pro-Iranian resistance group,
claimed responsibility for the attack. It said said its guerrillas
infiltrated Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon
and planted three bombs around the premises of the militia's Voice
Of Hope radio station.
   ``Then they fired two rockets at the radio station before
returning safely to base,'' said a spokesman for the group, who
refused to be identified.
   A statement released earlier by Islamic Resistance said the
guerrillas ``blew up'' the radio station, inflicting ``heavy losses
on the (pro-Israeli) agents.''
   The Voice of Hope, in its midday newscast, said the two
militiamen were killed as they were defusing one of the bombs. It
denied the station had been damaged.
   The radio station is located in Marjayoun, the provincial capital
of the security zone which is patrolled by both Israeli troops and
SLA militiamen.
   Israel established the narrow strip just inside Lebanon in 1985
when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon following a
three-year occupation. It maintains the six- by 10-mile strip as a
buffer against border guerrilla forays into northern Israel.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Sunday
convened 128 intellectuals, artists and activists, and they
organized into a permanent citizen's committee that will address
Poland's social and political problems.
   The committee began as an informal council that Walesa has
invited to five meetings since May 1987 to make policy statements on
behalf of the country's opposition movement.
   The new permanent committee is to meet four times a year and
establish 15 commissions that will examine social problems and
suggest solutions, said committee members who gathered Sunday in a
church near the Roman Catholic Episcopate in Warsaw.
   Topics to be dealt include political and economic reform,
education, housing, culture, youth and ecology.
   Among those who are to contribute to the commissions are experts
who have been preparing the planned talks between Walesa supporters
and the government on Poland's future.
   As a condition for holding talks with the government, Solidarity
has asked the government to declare its intent to legalize the trade
union federation, which was banned in 1982.
   Andrzej Wielowieyski, an adviser to Walesa and a spokesman for
the committee, said Sunday that members of the new committee view
the planned talks as only one way to begin a dialogue with the
government. He said the discussions could take place in other forms,
such as through the newly-formed commissions.
   Walesa hinted Thursday in Gdansk that he expected a breakthrough
in the dialogue with authorities, but Sunday's meeting produced no
new signs of such an agreement. However, Walesa confirmed that
low-level contacts between the opposition and authorities have
continued in recent weeks.
   Walesa said he was represented by the Rev. Alojzy Orszulik, an
official of the Roman Catholic Church who has been in touch with
Stanislaw Ciosek, a deputy party Politburo member.
   The forming of the new committee came before a key Communist
Party Central Committee meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in which
officials plan to discuss prospects for speeding up political reform
and democratization.
   On the surface, relations between Walesa and the authorities have
never been so cordial since the government declared martial law and
cracked down on the trade federation in 1981, a year after Walesa
formed Solidarity. Solidarity was outlawed in 1982.
   In the past month, the Solidarity leader has been allowed to
speak in a national TV debate, was permitted on his first foreign
journey in seven years _ to France _ and his statements and
activities have been publicized and even praised in the official
media.
   On Thursday, Walesa said recent remarks by government spokesman
Jerzy Urban have come ``very close'' to Solidarity's demand that the
government express its intent to legalize Solidarity. But Walesa
said the ```i' still has not been dotted.''

<TEXT>
   Police officers on Sunday defied the
government and went to the polls to elect union representatives for
the first time in the 155-year history of their force.
   Thousands of police officers gathered in central Athens to elect
a 15-member executive committee for the Union of Lower Ranking
Police Officers, the first in Greek police history.
   Despite government objections, the union was set up earlier this
year to represent officers with a rank of sergeant or below. The
union now has 18,000 registered members, said Sgt. Kostas Siggounis,
acting chairman of the union.
   The government, which claims it is unconstitutional for police
officers to form a union, has threatened them with transfers to
remote provincial posts, administrative punishment and dismissal,
union founders say.
   Union elections took place in the provinces last week and all
votes will be counted in Athens on Sunday.
   The Greek police is structured much like an army and is run by
the Ministry of Public Order, which has said that unionization
disrupts the chain of command and ``the police hierarchy's method of
operation.''
   ``They are worried that we will start questioning orders and
upset the hierarchy in the Greek police,'' said Yiannis Kotsis,
another union member.
   The Greek constitution forbids members of the police to go on
strike but ``doesn't say anything about forming a union,'' Kotsis
said. Because of his union activities, the officer has been
transferred from Athens, where he served for 17 years, to the
northern town of Grevena, about 275 miles north of the capital.
   Siggounis and other officers say their aim is to modernize the
force and secure better living and working conditions. A police
officer's starting salary is $394 a month, Siggounis said.

   A gunman shot and wounded a Belgian
missionary who was about to celebrate Mass in a northern town, the
head of the priest's congregation said Sunday.
   Rev. Francis Jevaert also said another Belgian priest has been
missing since last month in the northern Cordillera mountains.
   Jevaert said Rev. Mike Haelterman was shot on Friday in Tabuk,
about 200 miles north of Manila, just before the scheduled morning
Mass.
   The assailant apparently escaped and Haelterman, parish priest of
the Bolanao district in Tabuk, was hospitalized and released,
Jevaert said.
   He said no motive has been established for the shooting, but
added that local radio stations had accused Haelterman of aiding
communist New People's Army guerrillas who are active in the area.
   ``For me, that is only hearsay,'' Jevaert said. ``I don't know if
that is the reason'' for the shooting, he added.
   The Rev. Leo van Winkel, parish priest of the nearby town of
Lubuagan, 25 miles southwest of Tabuk, was reported missing while
visiting several mountain villages in his parish, Jevaert said.
   He said parishioners last saw Van Winkel on Nov. 22, but did not
report him missing until Dec. 8, when the Belgian priest failed to
show up for a religious feast in the village of Tinglayan.

   A philanthropist has donated $20 million to the
Dallas Museum of Art, which will help the museum expand its space by
half, museum and city officials said.
   ``This is a great Christmas present to the museum,'' museum
president Vin Prothro said of the donation by Nancy Hamon, a
longtime supporter of the arts. ``This is a great Christmas present
to the city.
   ``This is something that will take us well into the future,''
Prothro added. ``This is the biggest gift in the history of the
Dallas Museum of Art, by far.''
   Mayor Annette Strauss said that in addition to providing an
impetus for future development in the downtown Arts District, an
expanded museum would have a positive impact on downtown business.
   ``It would bring tourists, and that helps our downtown hotels and
other businesses,'' Mrs. Strauss said.
   The donation is earmarked for a three-story wing that would be
named after Mrs. Hamon and her late husband, Jake. The museum
contains an eclectic collection ranging from South American
primitives to Picassos.

   Emperor Hirohito suffered internal bleeding for the
fourth consecutive day and his blood pressure fell Sunday, the
Imperial Household Agency said.
   The 87-year-old emperor, who has been bedridden since Sept. 19,
is hemorrhaging from the upper intestine, where he underwent a
bypass operation last year.
   Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda told reporters the amount of blood
Hirohito discharged Saturday and Sunday was ``quite small.''
   Maeda said the ailing monarch's systolic blood pressure was 94
over 40 Sunday morning and 90 over 46 in the evening. An average
reading is about 120 over 80.
   Police, meanwhile, reported a fire Sunday at the Musashiryo
imperial mausoleum in Hachioji, near Tokyo, where Hirohito's father,
Emperor Taisho, and mother are buried.
   The fire, believed to be arson, razed trees west of the
mausoleum, said a police officer who requested anonymity. He said
investigators believed the fire was set by radicals opposing the
monarchy.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cold, moist air produced snow Sunday in the northern mountains of
Southern California and western Nevada, as well as light drizzle in
parts of Southern California and rain showers along the central
California coast.
   Snow fell at a rate of an inch an hour at Reno, Nev., on Sunday
morning. The western valleys of Nevada received 1 to 2 inches of
snow, and the eastern foothills of the Sierra Nevada as well as the
Lake Tahoe area had as much as 8 inches.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Sunday night and Monday for
higher elevations of northern Arizona, where some areas were
expected to receive up to 6 inches of new snow.
   A weather system moving into the northern Rockies was expected to
bring snow in high elevations and freezing rain in the valleys of
western Montana.
   High winds blew along the eastern slopes of the Rockies in
Montana. Winds gusted to as high as 68 mph at Cutbank, Mont.
   Elsewhere, cold, westerly winds blowing over the warm waters of
the Great Lakes produced so-called ``lake-effect'' snow Sunday in
some areas on the lakes' eastern fringes. Parts of western New York
state were expected to receive 3 to 5 inches of new snow.
   Light snow also fell in much of Lower Michigan and eastern parts
of Upper Michigan. Two inches of snow fell at Marquette, Mich., in
the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., to 71 at Brownsville, Texas. The low in
the nation Sunday morning was 16 below zero at Jackson.
   The forecast for Monday called for rain showers in New Mexico and
Arizona, with snow in higher elevations; snow in the northern
Rockies and western portions of the northern Plains; rain along the
central Pacific Coast; a mixture of snow showers and rain showers in
western New York state; lake-effect snow in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan; and light snow in northern Maine.
   High temperatures were forecast to reach only the teens in
northern Maine; the 20s and 30s from the northern Intermountain
region across the northern Rockies, North Dakota, the upper
Mississippi Valley, most of the Great Lakes region, and from the
central Appalachians to the remainder of New England; in the 60s
from Southern California and Arizona across the southern Plains, the
lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast states to the southern
Atlantic Coast and northern Florida; and the 70s in southern Texas
and southern Florida. The remainder of the nation generally will
have highs in the 40s and 50s.

<HEAD>O'Hare Police Arrest Man After Discovering Weapons in Suitcase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Filipino native was arrested Sunday at O'Hare
International Airport after a search of his family's
Philippine-bound luggage revealed two automatic weapons, seven
handguns and parts for several more, police said.
   The arrest occurred as the man, identified by police as Lamberto
Camacho, prepared to put his wife and two children on a Northwest
Airlines jet headed for Manila.
   ``We think this guy is a part-time gun-runner,'' said Sgt. John
Fanning of the Chicago Police Department's O'Hare unit. ``He told us
the extra parts were for weapons that already had gone through
previously.''
   Fanning said Camacho, 44, of Defiance, Ohio, works as a lab
technician for General Motors Corp. He was charged with unlawful use
of a weapon and attempting to board an airplane with weapons,
Fanning said.
   Fanning would not say why the man, who did not have a ticket, was
charged rather than the wife and children, who had tickets. The
weapons were found in the family's checked baggag.
   A routine X-ray of the luggage, he said, ``revealed an Uzi
(automatic machine pistol) hidden among the clothes in one suitcase.
A subsequent check of the rest of the luggage turned up a
false-bottomed crate where the second Uzi and three other pieces
were stashed.
   ``We found three more (handguns) in another bag,'' Fanning said.
``Apparently, there's a lot of money to be made running guns into a
place where there's political unrest.''
   Camacho was being interviewed by agents of the FBI, and
investigators from both the Federal Aviation Administration and the
U.S. Customs Service, and may face federal charges in addition to
the state charges already filed, Fanning said.
   He was expected to be transfered to a nearby Chicago police
district lockup later Sunday.

   PLO officials accused Washington of
maintaining a double-standard in its Middle East policy Sunday and
pledged to keep up attacks on Israeli military targets, though they
have renounced terror.
   ``Reagan may stop his government's dialogue with the PLO now if
he thinks he will be able to stop our attacks against Israeli
military targets,'' said Salah Khalaf, second-in-command to Yasser
Arafat in Fatah, the largest group in the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   ``Arafat's denunciation of terrorism in Geneva did not include
military attacks against Israel,'' said Khalaf, also known as Abu
Iyad. He spoke at a rally and a news conference in Abu Dhabi, United
Arab Emirates.
   ``Our struggle will continue until we raise the Palestinian flag
over Jerusalem,'' he said.
   Arafat spoke last week to the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva,
where the body's session relocated after Washington refused to grant
him a visa to visit U.N. headquarters in New York.
   On Sunday, he met in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
to discuss how to keep momentum gained by the first direct U.S-PLO
dialogue that began last week.
   Both Arafat and Mubarak told reporters an international peace
conference could lead to direct talks between Israel and the PLO.
   ``Israel and the United States should not fear the convening of
the international peace conference, because it will definitely lead
to direct negotiations,'' said Mubarak.
   Arafat added, ``Do you think we are going to the conference to
talk to ourselves? No, we are going to negotiate with our enemies.''
   In Tunis, Khalid Hassan, a senior adviser to Arafat, said he
hopes President-elect George Bush will formulate a clear policy that
will lead to an international peace conference on the Middle East.
   ``I don't understand the policy of the U.S. government.
Unfortunately, they adopt a double-standard of thinking and
talking,'' said Hassan, a co-founder of Fatah.
   ``The U.S. government needs a lot of work to prove its
credibility. I hope Bush will do that,'' Hassan said in an interview
two days after Friday's U.S.-PLO talks in Tunis.
   The United States last week reversed a 13-year ban on official
contacts with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism, recognized
Israel's right to exist and accepted U.N. resolutions guaranteeing
safe borders for countries in the region.
   Washington has refused to recognize an independent Palestinian
state the PLO proclaimed in Algiers last month without specifying
its borders.
   The next U.S.-PLO meeting is expected after the Bush
administration takes office Jan. 20.
   Arafat told reporters in Tunis Saturday that the PLO's main
priority is the early convening of an international peace conference
on the Middle East.
   Israel has refused to include the PLO, which it regards as a
terror group, as a partner in peace talks and has demanded direct
talks with non-PLO Palestinians.
   The PLO serves as an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla
factions which sometimes fight among themselves or launch
independent attacks on Israeli targets. The largest group is
Arafat's Fatah.
   Hassan said the PLO rejects the idea of the United States as a
sole mediator in talks because ``the Americans ... took sides
already.''
   He stressed there can be no Middle East peace settlement without
Soviet involvement and he said Washington and Moscow must agree on
the international conference.
   In Israel, nearly 200 members of the left-of-center Labor Party
called on the party to accept the PLO as a partner for peace talks,
Israel radio said.
   ``There is a need to talk to Palestinians and the PLO, which has
changed from a terrorist organization to a political organization,''
Labor legislator Haim Ramon said on Israel radio during the meeting
in Tel Aviv.
   In Jerusalem, Labor ministers put forward a 10-year-old proposal
to grant autonomy to Palestinians in the occupied territories in a
weekly Cabinet session.

   Israeli peace activists skirted an army blockade
to meet with Palestinians Sunday, journalists reported, on a day of
more clashes in the occupied lands with three Arabs reported killed
and at least 22 wounded.
   A 9-month-old Israeli girl knocked unconscious in a weekend
stoning attack on a car was in serious but stable condition at
Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The army confirmed all three deaths Sunday, but a military
spokesman said he knew of only four Palestinians wounded. Arab
hospital officials and reporters said at least 22 were wounded.
   At a Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir indirectly
criticized U.S. and European leaders in comments on the opening of
U.S. diplomatic contacts with the PLO, Israel radio reported.
   ``The whole world wants us to withdraw from Judea and Samaria,''
the radio quoted Shamir as saying. ``They are weary of the conflict.
The world concentrates more on an Israeli withdrawal than on the
need for peace.''
   Judea and Samaria are the biblical names for the West Bank.
   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said the premier planned to
counter the latest U.S. move by launching his own initiative with a
trip to Washington in February or March.
   The clashes erupted during a general strike called to protest
five Arab deaths Friday in the West Bank city of Nablus, hospital
officials said.
   Despite the violence, a group of about 40 Israelis sponsored by
the leftist Peace Now movement traveled to the West Bank town of
Beit Sahur to tell a church filled with 400 Palestinian worshipers
they favored dialogue with the PLO.
   The activists, including legislator Ran Cohen of the left-wing
Citizens Rights Movement, reached the town by a back road after the
army shut main roads into the town, news photographers at the scene
said.
   ``We believe that now there is only one possibility of solution
... a solution which includes a Palestinian independent state beside
the State of Israel,'' Cohen said during the visit.
   Asked why the army tried to seal off the town, a military
spokesman said: ``There were warnings that there would be attempts
to disrupt public order in the area and therefore it was decided to
close it.''
   Issa Yacoub Massad, a Beit Sahur resident, said youths in the
town had agreed not to throw stones during the visit.
   Before the Israelis spoke at the church, townspeople broke into
the Palestinian anthem ``Homeland, Homeland.'' Later, about 200
Palestinian women demonstrated outside, chanting pro-PLO slogans and
waving a PLO flag. Soldiers ordered them to disperse and there was
no violence.
   Sunday's general strike paralyzed public transportation and
commerce throughout the occupied territories and complicated
Israel's efforts to reopen West Bank high schools, which have been
shut since September.
   A military government spokesman said all the high schools opened
except those in Nablus, which has been under curfew since bloody
clashes claimed five victims Friday. But Arab news reports said many
of the 50,000 high school pupils didn't attend classes because of
the strike.
   Sunday's fatalities were identified by hospital officials as
Ibrahim Mohammed Badran, 24, of Deir al Ghusun village near Tulkarem
in the West Bank, Zoheir Ismail Fiyad, 22, of Shabura in Gaza, and
Mohammed Ferhat, 30, also of Shabura.
   Their deaths raised to 332 the number of Palestinians killed in
the yearlong uprising against Israeli occupation. Thirteen Israelis
also have been killed.
   An army spokesman said Badran was shot as he tried to throw a
concrete block at a soldier from a rooftop as troops conducted a
search and arrest raid in his hometown of 3,000.
   The second fatality, Fiyad, a student at Gaza's Islamic
University, was shot during a protest in the Shabura neighborhood of
Rafah, on the Egyptian border in Gaza, an official at nearby Nasser
Hospital said.
   An army spokesman confirmed Fiyad's death but said investigators
were checking the circumstances.
   The other victim died at a U.N. clinic in Rafah, according to
Arab reports. Other casualties occurred during eight clashes in Gaza
and the West Bank, hospital officials said. Arab news reports said a
curfew was placed on Nablus, Qalqilya, and the Deir al Balah refugee
camp.

   Reagan administration officials on Sunday vowed
to closely monitor whether the Palestine Liberation Organization
honors its anti-terrorism pledge, even as a top PLO spokesman
signaled intentions to continue military attacks on Israel.
   The administration already is under harsh criticism from Israel
for its first-ever dialogue with the PLO. On Sunday, PLO advisor
Khalid Hassan charged in an interview in Tunis that the United
States is pursuing an ambiguous Middle East policy.
   In addition, Salah Khalaf, second in command to PLO leader Yasser
Arafat in Fatah, the largest PLO group, told an Abu Dhabi news
conference that Arafat's denunciation of terrorism last week ``did
not include military attacks against Israel.''
   ``Our struggle will continue until we raise the Palestinian flag
over Jerusalem,'' he said.
   State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said Sunday he was
unfamiliar with the comments and there would be no immediate comment
from the department.
   Meanwhile, administration officials said Sunday they will be
checking to ensure that Arafat keeps his word.
   While acknowledging that Arafat does not control all Palestinian
factions that may engage in terrorism, Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy said U.S. officials ``have our sources, we have our
means,'' of finding out whether he honors his commitment against
terrorism.
   ``We are going to take these things on a case-by-case basis. The
president has made it plain we can't sustain this dialogue if
terrorism continues,'' Murphy said on the ABC-TV program ``This Week
with David Brinkley.''
   National Security Adviser Colin Powell, appearing on another
Sunday television program, said the United States ``will be watching
their performance on terrorism very, very carefully.''
   ``If we see an act of terrorism and it can be traced back to the
PLO leadership ... then clearly, they will be breaking their word,''
Powell said on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press.'' ``But of course,
violence is a way of life in the Middle East regrettably. And it
isn't clear that every act of violence or every terrorist incident
can be traced back to the PLO. But it is something we will be
watching very carefully.''
   Murphy, speaking on the ABC program, added:
   ``Terrorism has been renounced in words, now we will see what
happens. What is plain is we are not going to go on words alone.''
   Michael Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
said the United States expected Arafat not only to speak against
terrorism but to expel from the PLO anyone involved in terrorist
acts and also to distance the organization from any ``elements close
to the PLO'' linked to terrorism.
   ``We're not talking simply about condemning. We're talking about
disassociation and expulsion,'' he said in an interview on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation.''
   Israeli officials, outraged at President Reagan's reversal of
longstanding U.S. policy against talking to the PLO, showed no signs
Sunday of abandoning their position.
   Benjamin Netanyahu, a member of the Israeli Knesset and former
Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, complained that the United
States did not consult with its ally before making the decision
Wednesday.
   Netanyahu called the move ``a surprise at a very late hour in the
night.''
   He warned that the decision will strain U.S.-Israeli relations
and said the ``complete trust'' that Israel had shared with the
United States has been ``shaken badly.''
   ``I think there are specific consequences. I hope we don't come
to that,'' he said on the ABC program. ``You achieve peace by good
faith negotiations and by keeping your commitments, by keeping your
word. And frankly I think there's been a shakeup in our belief in
America's commitment and its credibility.''
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, speaking on the CBS
program, said Israel was skeptical of Arafat's renunciation of
terrorism and would wait ``a couple of months and see if this is
really going to happen.''
   Peres said it was his position that Israel should negotiate with
``every Palestinian ``who is not engaged in terror ... and who wants
to negotiate a peaceful solution.'' But he added: ``I have my doubts
about Mr. Arafat.''
   Armacost, asked how the United States could justify opening a
dialogue with the PLO while its charter calls for the destruction of
Israel, said Arafat's actions this week superseded that declaration.
   The Israelis contend the PLO is engaging in a rhetorical ruse to
win support for an independent Palestinian state it plans to use as
a base to attack Israel.
   Armacost said any such attempt would ultimately hurt the PLO.
   ``They have indicated publicly that they accept Israel's right to
exist in peace and safety,'' he said. ``And if this is a clever
tactical ruse, not only will the dialogue with us go nowhere, but
there is no prospect of peace and they should have no illusions.''

   A 2{-year-old girl woke up early Sunday at
her grandparents' house, walked out a faulty back door and wandered
a quarter of a mile in 2-degree cold until a motorist found her,
police said.
   Stephanie Gagne, who was wearing pink pajamas with feet, was
reunited with her family about five hours later when her 6-year-old
sister woke up and discovered her younger sister was missing.
   ``I know everything ended up fine, but you don't know how bad I
feel,'' said the girl's grandmother, Anita Gagne.
   ``I said to her, `Why did you do that, honey? Why did you do that
to Memere?''' said Gagne, 57, using a French word for grandmother.
   ``She said, `I was looking for you, Memere,''' Gagne said.
   The girl's mother, Loretta Gagne, 40, said her daughter seemed
unfazed by her early-morning ramble. A motorist found the girl,
clutching a blanket, at least a quarter-mile from her grandparents'
house and flagged down a passing police cruiser about 3:15 a.m.,
said Concord Police Sgt. James Cross.
   Stephanie and her sister, Emily, spent the night with their
grandparents while their parents went to a Christmas party. It was
only the second night Stephanie was away from home.
   The toddler kept waking up, her grandmother said, so sometime
after 2 a.m. she turned off the kitchen light. When Stephanie awoke
again in the darkness, she apparently wandered out the back door,
which had not been working properly.
   After doctors determined Stephanie was fine, police knocked on
doors near where she was found but could not find her family. They
brought her back to police headquarters. When the family members
realized Stephanie was missing, they called police, who gave them
the good news that she was safe.

   Thieves who stole toys for poor children
were foiled by donors who flooded a collection center with thousands
of dollars worth of gifts and checks, charity workers said.
   Barbara Zahner, executive director of Sacred Heart Community
Services, said she was overwhelmed by the response after thieves
broke into a storeroom and took the best toys among the 2,000 set
aside for needy children.
   ``I'm just astonished at the goodness of people,'' said Zahner.
   Several hundred people drove up over the weekend and left gifts
and donations, including teddy bears, bicycles and board games, she
said.
   ``You can't get any lower than stealing children's toys,'' said
Gary Miller, who came to the center with his family to help sort the
items.
   The thieves took only the best toys, including new stuffed
animals, the doll babies and trucks, Zahner said Friday.
   Sacred Heart Community Services holds a toy giveaway each year,
allowing about 1,000 parents who register to choose from the new and
used toys. This year's giveaway will take place Monday.
   Zahner said two men were seen walking down the hall with full
plastic garbage bags Thursday night, but no one paid much attention
to them.
   There were no signs of forced entry, so Zahner said she suspects
the thieves may have had a key to the building.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Sunday approved the 1989
budget proposed by the embattled socialist government of Premier
Andreas Papandreou, who threatened to resign if the spending plan
did not pass.
   Papandreou termed it a vote of confidence. The vote came four
days after the resignation of his deputy national economy minister,
the seventh Cabinet-level official to step down since a
multimillion-dollar banking and arms scandals surfaced in October.
   With a raise of hands Parliament voted 156 to 140, with two
abstentions by leftist lawmakers, in favor of the record $27.9
billion budget that is projected to run a $9.6 billion deficit.
   The budget plan sparked recent strikes and demonstrations by
educators and other government employees who demanded higher pay
raises to keep up with a 15-percent inflation rate.
   All those voting in favor of the budget were from Papandreou's
governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK. The conservative
New Democracy party along with the Greek Communist Party voted
against the budget, describing it as the ``worst in Greek history.''
   The conservatives and the Communists declined to participate in
the five-day debate in the 300-member single-chamber house.
   Rumors circulated before the crucial vote that several PASOK
deputies were ready to bolt the party and vote against the budget.
But defections never materialized, as the 69-year-old Papandreou
made one of his rare appearances in Parliament to keep his deputies
in line.
   The opposition has repeatedly called for Papandreou to resign
since October when the $300 million scandal rose to the surface,
implicating senior members of his government.
   Papandreou has adamantly refused to step down and said he intends
to remain until his term in office expires in June when general
elections are scheduled. But he told a nationwide television
audience Saturday that he would quit if the budget was not approved.
   ``I want to tell the Greek people that this vote is for me a vote
of confidence,'' Papandreou said.
   Opposition parties say government officials were involved in
illegal deals allegedly set up by banker George Koskotas, who is
accused of influence peddling, embezzlement and fraud.
   The transactions allegedly involved _ directly or indirectly _
the prime minister and members of his party, including Papandreou's
son, George, who is minister of education.
   Last week Deputy Defense Minister Stathis Yiotas quit, saying he
``did not want to be associated with adventurers, swindlers and
embezzlers of public money.''
   He charged the directors of the Greek Arms Industry of paying
commissions of millions of dollars for unfulfilled contracts to arms
dealers hiding behind dummy companies. Koskotas claims to have
documents implicating senior government officials in illegal money
transfers abroad.
   The scandal widened when Greek newspapers and opposition parties
accused officials working for the post office, telephone company and
other public services of receiving interest rates above the legal
limit from the Bank of Crete and pocketing the difference.
   Koskotas, the former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece
Nov. 6 and has been arrested in the United States. The 34-year-old
banker, who first fled to Brazil and Bermuda, is in a Boston, Mass.,
prison awaiting an extradition hearing.
   Koskotas, who ran a house-painting business in New York from 1974
to 1979, also is charged with attempting to defraud the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. A hearing is scheduled in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan on Jan. 9.

   Police on Sunday arrested two men in a gang
shooting at a crowded shopping mall that left a teen-age bystander
dead.
   Roger Leon White, 22, of Sepulveda and William Stalling, 18, of
Pacoima, were booked for investigation of murder and held without
bail in the fatal shooting Friday of Sergio Alpuche, 16, of Van
Nuys, said Detective Mel Arnold.
   Police said a fistfight broke out between two gang rivals, and a
third gang member opened fire. Alpuche, who was not a gang member,
was hit by a bullet in the chest while Christmas shopping and died
at a hospital Saturday, police said.
   Arnold refused to say which of the suspects was alleged to be the
gunman.
   In other street violence Saturday night, nine people were wounded
in five shootings. Four of those attacks were linked by police to
gangs.

<TEXT>
   More than 3,300 plaintiffs in a 1980
lawsuit over pesticide pollution will begin receiving checks this
week ranging up to $22,500 as their shares of a $15 million
settlement.
   Olin Corp. closed the DDT plant at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville
some 18 years ago. The 1980 lawsuit filed against Olin by the
federal government grew out of reports of illnesses among residents
living near or fishing from waterways fed by a stream from the plant.
   U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon of Birmingham, who approved the
class-action settlement in 1986, reviewed and approved the
distribution formula late last month.
   All 9,400 claimants were required to submit to blood tests and
complete an extensive questionnaire.
   Of the letters going out beginning Wednesday, about 3,300 will
contain checks ranging from $500 to $22,500; the other 6,100 letters
will inform recipients that their DDT levels were not found to be
elevated, officials said.
   ``The good news will be for those who receive letters saying they
have a normal level of DDT in their body,'' Francis McGovern,
special master of the court-approved settlement plan, said Saturday.
   About one-third of the $15 million settlement went to pay for
legal fees and medical testing, he said.
   According to McGovern, the DDT levels of two residents measured
45 times above normal; each will receive a check for $22,500.
Sixteen people had levels 20 times or more above normal and will
receive checks of $10,000 or higher. The lowest payments, about
$500, will go to some 1,625 plaintiffs whose DDT levels were twice
normal.

   Pope John Paul II blessed nativity scene
figures presented by children Sunday and urged prayers for Armenian
children who will be homeless at Christmas because of the
devastating quake in the Soviet republic.
   The head of the Roman Catholic church made the appeal during the
traditional blessing service in St. Peter's Square. Roman children
carry figures of the baby Jesus to the gathering to receive the
pope's blessing before setting up nativity creches in their homes.
   ``Pray that Christmas will bring joy and peace into your house
and into those of all children of the world, remembering in a
special way the children who lost their houses in these recent days
because of the disastrous calamities that struck their homeland,''
the pontiff said.
   Officials say about 500,000 people were left homeless in the Dec.
7 quake that killed an estimated 55,000 people and injured thousands.

   Friends and foes of nuclear power say they see
the Bush administration taking a strong position in favor of atomic
energy, provided strict safety requirements can be met.
   ``Our initial analysis is that we'll see a real push for new
nuclear power plants,'' said Michael Mariotte, director of the
Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a Washington-based group
opposed to nuclear power.
   Mariotte pointed to campaign statements by Bush and his choice of
New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, an ardent supporter of nuclear
power, to serve as White House chief of staff.
   ``With John Sununu in the White House, the nuclear industry has
its most powerful close friend ever,'' Mariotte said. ``It never had
a president or someone who ranks as high as Sununu does who is so
ideologically compatible with the industry.''
   Sununu has repeatedly locked horns with Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis over the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant.
Dukakis refused to submit evacuation plans for Massachusetts towns
located within 10 miles of the stalled New Hampshire plant, which
Sununu supports.
   During the campaign, Bush issued a policy statement saying that
``clearly our overriding concern on nuclear power issues must be to
protect the safety of the public. If nuclear power plants do not
reach the highest safety standards, they should not be licensed.
   ``But if they do meet these standards, I strongly believe we must
have nuclear power. We must protect ourselves from dependance on
foreign oil. We must diversify our energy sources, and safe nuclear
power can help improve our energy security.''
   The Republican Party platform also called for expansion of
nuclear power provided environmental and safety standards were met.
   Bush also will have to deal with safety and environmental
problems plaguing the Energy Department's nuclear weapons production
and research complex.
   During his second debate with Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential candidate, Bush said the department's Savannah River
Plant in South Carolina ``needs to be made more safe. Will he
(Dukakis) join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?
Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the ... nuclear material
requirements for our Defense Department?''
   Much will depend on whom Bush names as his secretary of energy.
Among the names repeatedly mentioned are Peter Johnson, former head
of Oregon's Bonneville Power Administration, and former Rep. Henson
Moore, R-La.
   Craig Fuller, co-chairman of Bush's transition team, said in an
interview last week that the Bush forces are focusing the search on
someone who has the expertise to handle the nuclear waste question.
   Jacob Sherr, an attorney with the New York-based Natural
Resources Defense Council, said: ``I have seen no evidence so far
that Bush is really going to roll up his sleeves and that
(administration officials) are going to commit themselves to
doubling or tripling the DOE's nuclear weapons budget to really get
serious about cleaning up the mess.''
   Bush is expected to retain Lando W. Zech Jr. as chairman of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission until Zech's term expires in June. He
then will have the opportunity to name a new commissioner and select
the panel's next chairman.
   ``My guess is that Bush will appoint somebody who's much in the
Zech mold _ somebody who's going to continue the efforts Zech has
started to set the stage, as far as the government is able, to
enable a nuclear resurgence,'' Mariotte said.
   Harold Finger, president of the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, a Washington-based nuclear industry group, said he hoped
Bush would demonstrate ``federal leadership'' in helping persuade
state regulators to lift some economic disincentives that have
discouraged utilities from investing in new nuclear power plants.
   Edward M. Davis, president of the American Nuclear Energy
Council, the nuclear industry's chief lobbying arm, predicted the
new administration will find Congress supportive of measures to
further the development of nuclear power.
   Legislation expected to be introduced in the new Congress deals
with such issues as federal support for development of advanced
reactor designs, reforming NRC licensing procedures and reorganizing
the five-member NRC as an agency headed by a single administrator.
   The industry's rosy outlook for nuclear power, however, is
disputed by another Washington-based anti-nuclear group, the Safe
Energy Communication Council.
   The council said a September national opinion poll it
commissioned found that 59 percent of those responding opposed
further nuclear power development, 36 percent favored building more
nuclear reactors and 5 percent didn't know. The poll had a 3 percent
margin of error.
   ``In proposing to build new nuclear power plants, George Bush and
other nuclear power cheerleaders are way out of touch with Main
Street, U.S.A.,'' said Scott Denman, the group's director.

   Singer Lou Rawls was host of a star-studded
weekend telethon that raised more than $9.4 million in pledges for
the United Negro College Fund.
   More than 50 stars appeared in the Ninth Annual Lou Rawls Parade
of Stars featuring performances from celebrities including Ray
Charles, Harry Belafonte, Neil Sedaka, Ben Vereen, Aretha Franklin
and Bob Hope.
   Taped messages from Michael Jackson and President Reagan also
were shown during the seven-hour telethon.
   The show was broadcast locally from 6 p.m. Saturday to 1 a.m.
Sunday on KTLA-TV, but will not be shown in several cities,
including San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, St. Louis and Baltimore,
until Dec. 30. Telethon officials said telephone lines will be open
until the show has been televised in all target areas.
   ``The beat goes on and I'm still going,'' Rawls said during a
break in taping.
   ``These students are going to be the next politicians, lawyers,
doctors, engineers. ... We've got to make sure they get it right in
order for them to fulfill themselves and their destiny,'' he said.
   Contributions benefit 42 member colleges. The private schools
enroll about 45,000 students.
   Last year's telethon raised about $10 million, said college fund
spokeswoman Adrienne Rhodes.

   A dazed brakeman who wandered away from a
cable-car wreck that injured 11 people was located Sunday and will
be interviewed to determine the cause of the derailment, the transit
agency said.
   The crowded cable car failed to stop at the end of the line
Saturday night and ran up onto the concrete, shattering windows and
throwing passengers about, said transit manager James Ruth of the
San Francisco Municipal Railway.
   None of the injuries was serious, said agency spokesman George
Newkirk. The car remained upright.
   Nine-year gripman Marcus Lee was knocked unconscious for several
minutes and wandered off ``in a daze'' with what witnesses said was
a bloody head injury, Ruth said. A gripman operates a brake that
grips an underground cable.
   Newkirk said the agency contacted Lee by telephone Sunday and
will interview him on Monday.

   In the 40 years since Israel became a state,
diplomatic efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict have resulted
in a string of partial successes and lost opportunities.
   Saeb Erakat, a Palestinian political science professor at An
Najah University in the West Bank, said the Middle East impasse has
proved resistant to 77 separate initiatives since 1948.
   Even if current efforts lead to a peace agreement, he said, it
would take a long time to overcome the bitterness.
   ``We should not underestimate the years of violence, hatred and
war. There is a wall higher than the Great Wall of China between us,
and it will not be destroyed by the stroke of a pen,'' Erakat said
in an interview.
   Both the U.S. decision last week to open a dialogue with Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and new prospects for
Soviet-American cooperation have raised the possibility of a new
initiative.
   The initiative likely would focus on convening a U.N.-sponsored
international peace conference. But prospects are cloudy, because
Israel has rejected such a conference as a biased forum and the PLO
as an unfit partner.
   Analysts such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
believe that even if Palestinians and Israelis could be brought to
the table, the meeting would be pointless without first narrowing
differences on key issues.
   ``I know no Arab state, nor do I see anything in (a) PLO
statement, that would accept even the 1967 borders of Israel,'' he
said on ABC-TV's Nightline on Wednesday, apparently referring to
Israel's borders before the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel
seized Arab territory.
   ``I know no Israeli government that can consider going back
exactly to the 1967 borders,'' he said.
   U.S. peacemaking, up to and including the current administration,
has focused on trying to forge compromise over sovereignty and
territory.
   The U.S. initiatives have tried to get the Arabs to accept
Palestinian autonomy and confederation with Jordan in place of a
fully independent state.
   They have supported Israel's need to keep some of the 2,250
square miles of land captured in the 1967 war _ the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip _ but have proposed international guarantees,
security zones and peacekeeping forces to persuade Israel to give up
most of the territory.
   Until now, they have denied participation of the PLO.
   ``Involving the PLO is the new element,'' said Joseph Kostiner of
Tel Aviv University's Middle East studies center. ``It's a turning
point in the peace process.''
   Peace initiatives have usually been set in motion by outbreaks of
war or an upsurge in violence.
   _The first Arab-Iraeli war in 1948 resulted in U.N.-mediated
``proximity talks'' on the Greek island of Rhodes. Headed by U.N.
envoy Ralph Bunche, diplomats shuttled between hotel rooms because
Arab delegations refused to meet with Israelis.
   Israel eventually signed agreements with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan
and Egypt that fixed cease-fire lines, set up buffer zones and
created armistice commissions.
   _In the wake of the six-day war in 1967, U.N. envoy Gunnar
Jarring of Sweden unsuccessfully sought to promote a land-for-peace
settlement in accordance with U.N. Resolution 242, which has served
as the basis for all future peace efforts.
   The resolution calls for Israel's withdrawal from territory
occupied in 1967 and for the right of all nations in the region to
exist within secure borders.
   _In 1969-70, then-Secretary of State William Rogers presented a
series of plans that halted the Egypt-Israel War of Attrition.
Israel agreed to withdrawal based on Resolution 242 and Egypt agreed
to recognize Israel, but the initiative was aborted by the death of
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   _The Yom Kippur war in 1973 led to the Geneva peace conference
that December, in which the United States and Soviet Union served as
co-chairmen. The conference was the first to bring Arab states and
Israel together face to face.
   The meeting was adjourned after one day and never reconvened.
Egypt, Jordan and Israel participated, but Syria stayed home and the
PLO was not invited.
   _ In 1974, Israel raised with Kissinger the possibility of a
separation-of-forces agreement that included the return of the West
Bank town of Jericho to Jordan. But the idea was shelved when an
Arab summit ruled that the PLO and not Jordan was responsible for
the occupied land.
   _ In 1977, the Soviet Union and United States issued a rare joint
policy statement recognizing the ``legitimate rights'' of the
Palestinians and offering demilitarized zones, U.N. troops and
guarantees to insure Israel's security after withdrawal.
   Egypt's President Anwar Sadat pre-empted the plan by launching
his own intiative.
   _ The 1978 Camp David Accords served as the basis for the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty the following year and but failed to
resolve the Palestinian question. They offered Palestinians limited
self-government for a five-year transition period, after which the
final status of the West Bank and Gaza would be determined.
   _ Saudia Arabia's King Fahd, then crown prince, in 1981 offered a
plan that implicitly recognized Israel's right to live in peace. But
tensions leading up to the Lebanon war undermined the effort.
   _ In September 1982 as Palestinian guerrillas were leaving
Israeli-besieged Beirut, President Reagan urged a plan that ruled
out a Palestinian state but proposed that the West Bank and Gaza
Strip become an autonomous region associated with Jordan.
   U.S. diplomacy subsequently focused on getting Jordan's King
Hussein to stand in for the PLO in peace talks at the head of a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. That option was dealt a blow in
July when Hussein announced he was severing ties with the West Bank.

<TEXT>
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi arrived in the
Chinese capital Monday in the first visit to China by an Indian
leader since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, came 34 years ago.
   Gandhi flew into Beijing on a special Air India jet provided for
the trip. His usual plane remained in New Delhi because rats had
gnawed electrical cables in the aircraft.
   The five-day visit marks the first time the leaders of the
world's two most populous countries have met since 1960, when
Premier Chou Enlai went to New Delhi. China has about 1.08 billion
people, and India has about 880 million.
   Gandhi will meet with the communist government's leaders in
Beijing, tour the ancient city of Xian and visit Shanghai.
   On arrival at the airport, the Indian prime minister, wearing a
brown overcoat, was greeted by about 100 Indians who live in
Beijing. He made no statement to reporters.
   Before leaving his country, Gandhi said the visit will be ``very
important ... for this globe, for Asia and for both of us.''
   The two nations are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade, and science and technology. Consular offices
in the Chinese city of Shanghai and the Indian city of Bombay may
also be established as a result.
   However, little progress is expected on the main issue dividing
the two countries, their 2,400-mile-long border. They fought a brief
border war in 1962, and China occupied about 15,000 square miles of
Indian territory that India still wants back.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but made little
progress in eight rounds.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after China's 1949 revolution.
   In the early 1960s, relations deteriorated over the border issue
as well as personal and political disagreements between Chinese
leader Mao Tse-tung and Prime Minister Nehru.
   In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when China began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations, instead of
exporting communist revolution.
   Both Chinese and Indian officials say Gandhi's visit is intended
to create an atmosphere for greater communication _ not resolve the
border question.

<TEXT>
   The Ku Klux Klan littered a parade route
early Sunday with hundreds of cards wishing for a ``white
Christmas,'' but a city crew picked up all the cards before the
event began, police said.
   The holiday parade, which earlier had been postponed when Klan
Imperial Wizard Tony Bastanzio threatened to demand a place in the
lineup, went off without incident.
   The small Christmas cards read: ``Dreaming of a white Christmas,
Merry Christmas, the Ku Klux Klan.''
   Police will try to determine where they were printed and who
ordered them, Chief Bob Roberts said. They were distributed between
midnight and 2 a.m., he said.
   ``They came in like a thief in the night,'' Roberts said.
   The city crew had the cards picked up by 9:30 a.m., well before
the midafternoon parade started. Bastanzio declined to comment
before or after the parade.
   Earlier this month, the Lions Club gave Bastanzio permission to
drive a vehicle carrying robed Klansmen in the parade. But the club,
which has sponsored the annual parade for 17 years, later removed
the KKK from the lineup after Mayor Jeff Book and business leaders
objected.
   More than 50 police officers and sheriff's deputies were at the
parade, Roberts said. Police said they were unaware of any Klansmen
in the area.
   A heavy turnout for the parade represented a refusal to accept
racial prejudice in the central Florida community of 6,000, Roberts
said.
   ``That type of action isn't tolerated in Mount Dora,'' he said.
``Communities in general just aren't going to put up with it.''

   Foreign Ministers Eduard Shevardnadze and Sousuke
Uno began talks Monday that diplomats on both sides hope will help
normalize Soviet-Japanese relations, stalled more than 40 years over
an emotional border dispute.
   The two sides were expected to discuss regional issues, including
the Korean peninsula, Sino-Soviet relations and Kampuchea during
their first session, Foreign Ministry officials said.
   A key issue of their three rounds of talks will be the dispute
over Soviet-held Kurile islands off Japan's northern coast _ the
main obstacle Shevardnadze and Uno must overcome to pave the way for
improved relations between the two Asian powers.
   Shevardnadze, who arrived Sunday from Moscow on the first stop of
a three-nation Asian tour, expressed hopes the territorial dispute
will not further delay improvement in Soviet-Japanese relations.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has expressed interest in
increased economic cooperation and political dialogue with Japan.
But no real progress is likely until Moscow agrees to return the
islands, said diplomats in Tokyo who requested anonymity.
   ``Japan-Soviet political dialogue and mutual understanding is
generally delayed'' by the dispute, Shevardnadze acknowledged after
he arrived at Tokyo's Haneda International Airport.
   ``While there are objective reasons for this, it should be
possible to relax or eliminate the reasons for this delay'' in
improved relations, he added.
   The Soviet envoy, his wife and a 40-member entourage were greeted
at the airport by Uno, Toshiaki Muto, the Japanese ambassador to
Moscow, and Nikolai Soloviev, the Soviet ambassador to Japan.
   Substantial political dialogue between the two countries is
overdue, Shevardnadze said, adding, ``We're trying to decide what to
do.''
   Both Moscow and Tokyo claim the Kuril islands, which since World
War II have been occupied by Soviet troops who had ousted the 17,000
Japanese residents. For decades, the Soviets refused to admit a
territorial issue existed, but officials on both sides have said
they hope to make progress toward a resolution during Shevardnadze's
visit.
   Authorities were concerned about Shevardnadze's safety because of
protests by Japanese right-wing groups demanding return of the
islands. The airport was heavily guarded and in central Tokyo,
authorities increased security around the Soviet Embassy, where the
foreign minister is staying.
   One protester, allegedly a member of a rightist group, was
arrested Sunday for ignoring a police order to stop an
anti-Shevardnadze speech amplified by loudspeakers, police said.
   Shevardnadze's visit comes as Moscow is wooing capitalist Asian
nations with promises of military cutbacks in the region and
requests for foreign investment.
   In his discussions with Japanese officials, Shevardnadze is
expected to bring up economic cooperation, which Gorbachev has said
is needed to develop the Soviet republics in Asia.
   The Soviet need for advanced technology may give Japan leverage
to negotiate the disputed islands, said Ichiro Suetsugu, who heads
the private Council on National Security Problems.
   Trade between the Soviet Union and Japan reached $4.9 billion in
1987, but is expected to climb only slightly this year, to $4.98
billion.
   Japanese businessmen, lured by the huge Soviet market, complain
that the Soviets lack hard currency to pay for imported goods and
that restrictions on selling products in the Soviet Union make joint
ventures unprofitable.
   The Foreign Ministry has said the two nations will issue joint
statements on cultural exchanges and protection of migratory birds
after Shevardnadze's departure Wednesday.
   Japanese officials say they also will renew an invitation for
Gorbachev to visit Japan for a summit. The last Japan-Soviet summit
was in October 1973.
   Shevardnadze is to leave Tokyo on Wednesday for the Philippines
and North Korea.

   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas
on Sunday condemned political assassinations and a new leftist
guerrilla practice of intimidating elected officials into resigning.
   ``Political passions are building and respect for the sovereign
will of the people expressed at the polls is respected less,'' he
said during his weekly homily.
   Rivera Damas said an investigation by the church Legal Aid office
found local authorities who are members of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance on Tuesday killed Francisco Eduardo Bonilla, a
member of the Christian Democratic Party, in Soyapango, four miles
east of San Salvador.
   Bonilla worked with the Central Elections Council in registering
voters.
   ``Testimony gathered by Legal Aid office holds the mayor and city
police of Soyapango responsible, which if confirmed would be
serious,'' Rivera Damas said.
   The mayor, Jorge Corena, is a member of the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known by its Spanish acronym Arena.
   The archbishop also condemned recent actions by the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, the umbrella
group of five guerrilla groups fighting for nine years to overthrow
the U.S.-backed government.
   ``Equally worrisome is the new practice of the FMLN of forcing
elected officials to resign their posts,'' he said. ``Information
from this week tells of three mayors who could not resist guerrilla
threats and announced their resignations.''
   Since May, when new mayors took office, the group has killed
eight mayors it accused of taking part in government
counterinsurgency efforts.
   Arena is currently considered the front-runner against the
governing Christian Democrats in the Salvadoran presidential
elections scheduled for March 19.

<TEXT>
   Outflows of money leaving 17 heavily indebted
Third World countries -- from Argentina to Nigeria to the
Philippines -- are due to reach $31.1 billion this year, the World
Bank estimates in a study released Sunday.
   Last year's figure was $21.8 billion, almost one-third lower.
From all Third World debtors the net outflow was $43 billion, up
from $38.1 billion.
   The money was largely payments on debt. It went to commercial
banks and governments in the United States and other industrial
countries, and to intergovernment lenders like the World Bank itself.
   The bank is owned by 151 governments, with the United States
holding the largest number of shares.
   In the past, money tended to flow the other way: out of rich
countries in the form of loans and investments to develop the poor
ones. That tradition was still working as late as 1982 when the big
debtors took in $3.7 billion more than they paid out, according to
the bank's figures.
   The bank issued a statement Sunday emphasizing that loss of funds
by debtor countries hits their people in future generations too.
   ``Although both incomes and consumption have fallen -- incomes in
most highly indebted countries are lower today than a decade ago --
the adjustment burden has fallen mainly on investment,'' it said.
The drop of investment means fewer schools and roads and jobs in the
future.
   Stanley Fischer, vice president and top economist at the World
Bank, said its annual report on debt carried two messages:
   ``The first is that despite remarkably rapid growth in the
industrialized world in 1988, growth in the debtor nations has not
resumed. The second message is that the debt strategy is entering a
new phase, in which debt reduction is playing an increasingly
important role.''
   The report raised the bank's estimate of Third World debt to
$1.32 trillion at the end of this year. The total is expected to
drop to $1.3 trillion in 1989. It said debt has been growing more
slowly in terms of the dollar because of changes in currency values,
some agreements to reduce debt, and the continued reluctance of
commercial banks to make new loans.
   Fischer said governments are rethinking the debt problem. But he
said the idea of a new international body to buy up commercial debt
at a discount is ``just talk.'' He explained that governments in
creditor countries dislike the idea because it could look like
bailing out the commercial banks.
   The idea was urged by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in his
speech to the United Nations earlier this month. The trade law
signed by President Reagan last August instructs the secretary of
the Treasury to start negotiations on a new international body, but
adds that he need not if he thinks the move would drive down the
value of the loans.
   Loans of a dozen major debtor countries are selling now at an
average of 40 cents on the dollar, according to the Shearson Lehman
Hutton Developing Country Debt Index.
   The World Bank suggested that commercial banks should do more to
share the benefit of these discounts with the debtor countries.
Debtor governments have already bought back some of their loans for
cash, or allowed creditors to use them for buying up shares in
debtor country industries.
   Governments of the creditor countries were urged to harmonize
their tax systems and regulations to encourge banks to lend more,
and in some cases to guarantee the loans. Those governments should
also encourage imports from the debtors while debtor governments
should change their policies to encourage loans and investments, it
added.
   New figures released by the bank show that in 1980, the share of
the average Argentine in the national income was $1,990, while last
year that share was down to 1,630 of those 1980 dollars. In Mexico
the drop was from $2,690 to $2,290.
   In African countries south of the Sahara, average incomes dropped
5.2 percent in 1987, the bank reported. Though the debts of many
African countries are small, they make a heavier burden than in some
Latin American countries because Africans are fewer and poorer.
   Their average income was down from $570 dollars in 1980 to 440 of
those dollars last year.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced on Friday that he
would try to borrow another $6 billion for Mexico in the coming
year. That would be less than about $9 billion the country is due to
pay out as interest and repayments on its present debt of $102
billion.
   Salinas and other leaders of Latin America debtor countries are
expected to make a bid soon to negotiate a cut in the total debt and
the payments on it. Salinas said Mexico would only service its own
debt if payments are compatible with the country's growth.

   A worker at a Roman Catholic high school has
been charged with sexual abusing male students at the school, paying
one student for sex and secretly videotaping others running naked in
the building's basement.
   Robert E. Cushing, 36, was arrested Friday and charged with six
counts of third-degree sexual abuse, one count of prostitution and
one count of solicitation.
   According to an affidavit, four male students at Dubuque Wahlert
High School said they had engaged in sex with Cushing. The worker
admitted paying one student for sex several times earlier this year,
the affidavit alleges.
   Cushing was released Saturday on a $10,000 bond. A preliminary
hearing was set for Dec. 30.
   ``It was a total shock to us,'' said the school's principal, Don
Miller.
   Although there was no evidence any students were forced to have
sex, ``in my mind, these students are victims,'' Miller said. ``They
were victimized by someone in authority over them.''
   Officials suspended Cushing from his position in charge of
audio-visual equipment after learning of the police investigation
Dec. 8. He had been employed at the co-educational school for 16
years.
   Assistant Police Chief Terry Lambert said that male students ran
naked in electrical and heating tunnels in the school's basement as
part of an initiation rite to a technical drawing seminar supervised
by Cushing.
   A 14-year-old freshman said Cushing told him he had videotaped
the seminar students with hidden cameras ``so they wouldn't tell,''
according to court papers. Lambert estimated the initiation rite had
been going on ``for the last six or seven years.''
   School administrators have called in mental health experts to
counsel the students in Cushing's group.
   ``Just because we're a community of believers doesn't mean we're
a community of saints,'' Miller said.

<TEXT>
   The crew of a capsized U.S. oil rig
returned to this Canadian city Sunday, telling tales of singing,
joking and fantasizing about ordering pizza during their 22 hours
stranded in an enclosed life raft.
   ``I know I was saying my own special little prayers for
everybody,'' said 27-year-old Lynn Christian, one of two women on
the Rowan Gorilla I oil rig. ``It was scary.''
   The 27-member crew was forced into the raft three days earlier,
when a tow line broke and their rig foundered in the stormy Atlantic
Ocean about 1,200 miles east of New York. Their glass fiber life
capsule, about the size of a van, was battered by 40-foot-high waves.
   The crew was picked up Friday when the storm eased and the Smit
London, the tug that was towing the rig across the Atlantic to the
North Sea, could finally send out boats.
   During its ordeal the crew sang an old folk tune called
``Farewell to Nova Scotia'' about a sailor wondering whether he will
ever see home again. The crewmembers included 25 Canadians _ 24 of
them from Nova Scotia _ an American, and a Dutchman. The American's
name was not immediately available.
   Darrell Smith, a burly 32-year-old crane operator from Yarmouth,
Nova Scotia, recalled the almost-constant sound of patrol planes
above them _ a comforting reminder they weren't alone. They could
exchange messages via a two-way radio on the raft.
   Ms. Christian said the airplanes spawned a joke about calling out
for pizza.
   ``We were thinking about it,'' she said with a laugh. ``The
planes were going over and we were thinking about ordering one.''
   A company official said the crewmembers were all in good health
on their return.
   ``Some of them didn't even want to go to the hospital,'' said
Bill Hedrick, a spokesman for the Rowan Companies of Houston, owners
of the rig. ``They're all smiles; they look great.''
   The U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. National Safety Transportation
Board are launching inquiries. The rig was registered in the United
States and inspected by Americans.

   Sri Lankans voted for a new president
Monday under tight security after a blood-soaked campaign that left
hundreds dead and normal life in tatters.
   Ethnic extremists of the People's Liberation Front have vowed to
disrupt the elections and have threatened to kill anyone who voted.
   A big question mark was how many of this tropical island's 9.3
million eligible voters would ignore the threats and go to the polls.
   On the eve of the balloting, the government decreed that people
who intimidated others to prevent them from voting could face the
death penalty.
   Troops and police took up positions throughout the island to
ensure calm balloting.
   Polls opened under blue skies and balmy weather at 7:00 a.m.
(8:30 p.m. EST Sunday) and were to close at 4 p.m. (5:30 a.m. EST
Monday). Significant returns were not expected until Tuesday.
   Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa was the candidate of the
ruling United National Party and mentor of President Junius R.
Jayewardene, who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third
term.
   Former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party was the main opposition candidate. Ossie
Abeygoonesekera also was running as the head of a coalition of four
small leftist parties.
   ``This is a battle between the ballot and the bullet,'' Premadasa
said after casting his vote at the Colombo Municipal Council
Reception Hall. ``The bullet must not win.''
   He predicted victory but said the margin would depend on the
turnout.
   The election was held amid mounting bloodshed caused by ethnic
strife.
   Final days of the campaign were marked by waves of killings,
abductions and attacks on political rallies that disrupted normal
life once famed as a tourist haven.
   On the final weekend before the vote, at least 25 people were
killed, including six who died when gunment burst into the home of a
prominent opposition politician.
   The People's Liberation Front, which is threatening to kill
voters, is a shadowy group of extremists from the majority Buddhist
Sinhalese community upset by government concessions to minority
Hindu Tamils.
   Tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent state in northern
and eastern Sri Lanka also called for a boycott.
   Shops in Colombo that normally would be open for Christmas and
New Year shopping were shuttered Sunday and traffic was light.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that despite
heightened security, Sinhalese extremists in the south killed four
soldiers during the weekend, blocked roads by chopping down trees
and knocked down electricity poles.
   Local police blamed the People's Liberation Front for Sunday's
attack on a political meeting at the home of Neville Fernando in
Panadura, nine miles south of Colombo.
   Fernando, a Sinhalese, used to be a member of Jayewardene's party
but he left it to work for Mrs. Bandaranaike's party.
   Fernando was not hurt in the attack, which left six people dead
and six critically wounded, Panadura police said.
   In a communique, the government said ``any person (who) by words,
whether written or spoken, or by signs or by any conduct compels,
induces or incites any other person to refrain from voting at the
presidential elections . . . Shall be punishable with death or
imprisonment for a period of not less than 10 years.''
   It also said security forces were instructed to use ``maximum
force where necessary'' to enforce the decree.
   The People's Liberation Front is viewed as the biggest threat to
the election. It vowed to kill anyone who supported the government
after Jayewardene signed an Indian-brokered accord granting some
autonomy to the Tamils.
   The front also claims the government is incapable of conducting
fair elections, and it has attacked all parties participating in the
election.
   The government blames the front for the deaths of more than 650
people, mostly Sinhalese who supported the government, since the
accord was signed July 29, 1987.
   The Tamil insurrection has claimed at least 8,500 lives since
1983 when militants from the ethnic minority started attacking
government troops and massacring Sinhalese civilians.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's population. All three
presidential candidates are Sinhalese.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent.
   The fighting is no longer a clearly defined conflict between
Sinhalese and Tamils.
   Sinhalese are killing fellow Sinhalese, and rival Tamil factions
clash with each other and with Indian peacekeeping forces trying to
disarm them.

   Fire swept through a residential hotel
Sunday, killing one person, injuring nine and forcing the evacuation
of 100 residents, authorities said. Two people were still
unaccounted for at midevening.
   The blaze in the four-story Morningside Hotel apparently began on
the third floor about 9:40 a.m. and quickly spread. The downtown
hotel has 105 rooms, housing transients and some long-term residents.
   Smoke poured from the rear of the L-shaped, brick building, which
also contains a music store and karate school. The building was
largely gutted and a wall collapsed.
   ``I didn't even have time to grab my boots, and my boots were
right there by the door,'' said Helena M.B. TeleRado, 59, a
hairdresser who has lived in the hotel for 10 years.
   Fire Chief Luther Taylor said the fire apparently started when a
match was discarded improperly.
   Robert Ziker, the owner of the 64-year-old hotel, said resident
Julius Wood died in his fourth-floor apartment. Police said he was
49 years old.
   At midevening, Mayor Joe Kernan said that two people were still
unaccounted-for, but that authorities did not think they were
victims.
   ``We are hopeful and feel pretty good that there is no one left
in the building, but we can't say that with certainty until the
search is completed,'' said Kernan.
   Taylor said the building was destroyed but had no estimate of the
loss. The 60 firefighters and 15 pieces of equipment called to the
scene concentrated on rescuing residents before fighting the fire,
he said.
   At one time, the estimate of the number of unaaccounted-for was
as high as 16. ``Throughout the morning, we had people call in or
come down to the command post'' at a nearby church, said Lt. Richard
Kilgore, public information officer for the police department.
   Officials at Memorial Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Center
reported treating nine people. Four residents were admitted, one of
them in critical condition and another in serious condition,
officials at the two hospitals said. The other five people were
treated and released.
   Lester White, 46, a disabled former truck driver, said he watched
third-floor windows shatter from the heat after he fled the
building, and saw a man waiting for rescue while flames leaped from
the apartment next door. White escaped without his possessions but
was unharmed. ``That's the only thing I'm happy about,'' he said.
   ``The desk clerk came by the door and knocked and said,
`Fire!','' said Jeannie Skelton, 34, who had lived at the
Morningside about 18 months. ``When I went out into the hallway I
did see smoke, so then I knew it was the real thing and not a false
alarm.''
   Ms. TeleRado said fire alarms were a frequent occurrence, and
said she initially ignored the warnings of a maintenance man who
pounded on hallway walls and yelled that there was a fire. An alarm
began ringing but stopped after about five minutes, she said. Other
residents, too, may have been slow to learn of the danger or respond
to warnings, she said.
   About 60 firefighters began a room-by-room search of the hotel
after the fire was extinguished, Taylor said. Two suffered minor
injuries.
   Many residents fled shoeless and in nightclothes, said the Rev.
Steven Newton, director of a newly opened homeless center who took
in 56 Morningside residents. Most depend on Social Security benefits
or other limited incomes and paid as little as $135 a month for
rooms, according to Newton and some residents.
   ``They were in the last kind of housing you can get before the
streets,'' said Newton. ``We're not talking about condominiums being
burned out.''
   Word of the fire brought an outpouring of food, clothing, gifts
and money to the homeless center. Showing a personal check made out
to the center for $1,000, center volunteer David T. Link said,
``Somebody just walked in off the street with that.''

   An IRA car bomb exploded in
Londonderry Sunday night and damaged 100 homes, including some
occupied by British soldiers and their families, police said.
   They said a 12-year-old boy and his mother, members of a civilian
family, were taken to a hospital and treated for shock. No other
injuries were reported.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army telephoned a 20-minute warning
about the bomb on a housing project in the city's Waterside
district, but it exploded after 15 minutes, police said.
   It was the fourth attack on British army homes in the province in
the past month.
   The IRA, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite it with the Irish Republic, on Friday issued a one-week
deadline for the wives and children of British soldiers to get out
of what it called the ``war zone'' and return to the British
mainland.
   Some 10,500 British troops are currently deployed in Northern
Ireland. Unofficial estimates say between 1,500 and 2,000 soldiers
have their families with them.
   Since the IRA intensified attacks on British servicemen in March,
44 soldiers have been killed, including four at British bases in
continental Europe and one at a base in London.

<HEAD>Aid Trip to Armenia To Build Plastic Tents Delayed Till Midweek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volunteers hoping to build durable plastic
tents for the earthquake victims in Armenia had another setback
Sunday when red tape problems kept them off a Soviet transport
plane, pushing back their scheduled departure three more days.
   Anthony Seraphin, president of Protect-A-Boat and Film
Applicators of North America, which came up with the idea for the
quick-to-build shelters, said his team now plans to leave from Miami
on Wednesday night on the first leg of a trip to the Soviet Union.
   The team also has been reduced from its originally planned 17
members after the Soviets gave permission for only 12 to enter,
Union Carbide Corp. spokesman John P. Yimoyines said. Carbide is
paying the estimated $100,000 cost of the effort and makes the resin
used in the plastic housing material.
   The crew will take 200,000 square feet of resin-based plastic
film and 24,000 feet of galvanized steel piping, enough to make 100
tents, Yimoyines said.
   The tents are constructed by building frames out of steel and
then shrink-wrapping plastic around them, using a propane heat gun.
Seraphin said it takes about two hours to build a tent that can
house 30 people and includes doors, windows and vents. The tents can
last two years.
   The team had hoped to board a Soviet IL-76 transport Sunday, but
the group could not get State Department approval for their trip in
time, the men said. Before that, the Air National Guard had offered
to transport the crew and their equipment if the Defense Department
would OK the flight, but the Pentagon said Friday it would have to
forward the request to the State Department for its approval this
week.
   ``I hope this one is for real,'' Yimoyines said of Wednesday's
planned flight. ``I think it is, because we even have flight numbers
this time.''
   The travel plans are being made by the Washington, D.C.-based
Armenian Relief Society, Seraphin said. A society spokesman, Greg
Beadian, said he would not release details of the plans until late
Monday after informing all the donors.
   Continental Airlines will fly the team and the tent-making
equipment from Newark, N.J., to Miami, Yimoyines said.
   The team intends to build five to 10 shelters in towns in the
quake area, where at least 55,000 were killed and 500,000 left
homeless by the Dec. 7 earthquake, Seraphin said.
   ``Then when we get back, we'll be raising money to send more
material over there so they can do it themselves,'' he said.
   The team will not return before Christmas, but Yimoyines said he
can't imagine a better place to be for the holiday.
   ``That's the reason we're all going,'' he said, adding that the
group was taking a small Christmas tree. ``It's mostly guys who see
a chance to help.''

<HEAD>Quebec to Keep Partial Ban on Non-French Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC CITY, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Quebec government said Sunday it
will keep a partial prohibition on non-French store signs even
though the nation's highest court struck down the ban.
   The issue has threatened to deepen divisions once again between
the English-speaking minority and the French-speaking majority of
this eastern Canadian province.
   Quebec's government decided Sunday to override provincial and
federal charters of rights to keep the ban on outdoor signs.
However, the compromise proposal would allow merchants to post
bilingual signs indoors.
   ``To govern is to choose,'' Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa told a
Sunday afternoon news conference broadcast live on Quebec television
and radio. ``We are not happy to impose that solution.''
   The provincial government was reacting to a ruling Thursday by
the Supreme Court of Canada which struck down Quebec's French-only
sign law.
   The issue has posed the most difficult political test for
Bourassa since the election of his Liberal party three years ago.
   The court's decision was followed by a hectic weekend of meetings
of political leaders and provincial Cabinet members. Bourassa fought
to block a damaging split in the party and a walkout by
English-speaking members.
   The provincial government is ``asking an enormous concession''
from the province's English speakers, Bourassa said Sunday. But he
said French-speaking Quebecers are still too insecure about the
future of their language for the provincial government to allow
bilingual signs outside stores.
   Opposition Parti Quebecois house leader Guy Chevrette denounced
the new plan, saying the provincial government has taken the most
``pernicious and hypocritical route to the anglicization of
Quebec.'' The party once championed a movement for Quebec
independence from Canada, but it has moderated those views in recent
years.
   Royal Orr, president of the English-rights lobby, Alliance
Quebec, also condemned the decision, which overrides linguistic
freedoms established in Quebec's own charter of rights.
   ``You and your government are without principle, without the
courage to do what is right, and without the quality and integrity
of leadership which command respect,'' he said.
   Orr said the Quebec government's moral convictions should have
outweighed its legal right to use the ``notwithstanding'' clauses in
the two rights charters.
   Those clauses in the federal and Quebec charters allow the
province to override freedom-of-expression sections in both
documents.
   Bourassa wanted to work out a compromise that would please
hard-line elements in his caucus who wanted no changes in the sign
law, as well as English-speakers who urged the provincial government
to live up to a 1985 electoral pledge to allow bilingual signs both
inside and outside stores.
   Bourassa, whose Liberals lost power to the Parti Quebecois in
1976 partly because of language issue, held out hope that one day
there might be no ban on languages other than French on outside
commercial signs. But he added: ``I cannot commit myself to a
calendar.''
   He also delivered an emotional appeal to English-speaking members
of his caucus to remain in his government, saying, ``We need you.''
   Provincial government leaders say they will quickly put forward
new legislation to turn the proposed partial ban into law.

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people rallied Sunday to
mark the first anniversary of an opposition alliance, and they
listened to one leader pledge to beat the leftist government ``with
votes, not bullets.''
   The civic opposition now ``is more united, more cohesive and more
monolithic,'' Erick Ramirez of the Social Christian Party said at
the meeting Sunday. It will beat the Sandinistas in elections
scheduled for 1990 ``with votes, not bullets.''
   Hernaldo Zuniga of the Conservative Democratic Party said that
``Sandinista (government) efforts to divide the opposition'' have
failed. ``The Sandinista ideology and its political and economic
program are the biggest failure in the history of the country.''
   Police patrolled the area during the meeting of about 3,000
people. No violence was reported.
   The alliance is made up of 14 divergent groups, including Social
Christians, Liberals, Conservatives, Communists, Socialists, Social
Democrats, Central American Unionist parties, and the Workers
Permanent Congress. It was formed after a dialogue between the
government and opposition reached an impasse last December.
   The dialogue was initiated after Central American nations in
August 1987 signed regional accords that called for national peace
dialogues in the embattled region.
   The Sandinistas, who came to power through a revolution in 1979,
have been challenged by U.S.-backed rebels in an eight-year civil
war that has taken more than 50,000 lives. Most of the fighting
stopped when a cease-fire was declared in March.
   Mauricio Diaz, secretary general of the Popular Social Christian
Party, said that the Sandinista government increased its repression
in 1988, forcing thousands of Nicaraguans to flee to other countries.

80.
   Mrs. Lizio created the brand that bears her name, and her

Chicago-based Quaker Oats food conglomerate acquired the product.
   She was born in San Angelo, Italy, in 1908 and emigrated to the
United States with her husband, the late Anthony Lizio, in the
1920s. The couple settled on Chicago's West Side and opened their
first restaurant in 1937.
   They closed that establishment in 1962 and then began selling

   Six divisions of Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia headed toward their homeland, a news agency said Monday, in
what Vietnam has described as a weeklong operation to withdraw
18,000 more soldiers.
   The Vietnamese say the latest pullout ending Thursday will
complete withdrawal of about 50,000 of their soldiers from Cambodia
this year. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday that it
will leave another 50,000 Vietnamese troops still in Cambodia.
   The Cambodian news agency SPK said about 14,000 people bid
farewell to the departing divisions and their auxiliary units in
Phnom Penh at a ceremony attended by President Heng Samrin. The
report, dated Sunday, was monitored in Bangkok on Monday.
   The soldiers have been fighting Cambodian guerrillas since
Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and installed the Heng Samrin
government. Vietnam says it will withdraw all its soldiers by 1990
and leave the fighting to Heng Samrin's forces.

<TEXT>
   Two retailers, leaders in different aspects
of the home entertainment industry, have joined forces to offer
consumers a rare one-stop music, video and electronics center under
the same roof.
   Good Guys Inc., sellers of hardware such as televisions and VCRs,
and Tower Records Inc., marketers of software like compact discs,
records and tapes, signed a lease linking both stores inside the
same building at the Stonestown Galleria.
   ``I've been retailing since I was 18 and I've never heard of two
retailers occupying the same lease,'' said Kevin McNeill, manager of
the Good Guys store at Stonestown. ``It's so logical. The software
and the hardware of our industry in one building _ it makes sense.''
   At the Stonestown Galleria, the innovation of the arrangement
becomes quickly obvious when shoppers view the stores' names printed
in bold red letters on separate sides of the old I. Magnin Building.
   Inside, Good Guys merchandise spreads across 18,000 square feet
on the first floor, while Tower Records takes up another 18,000
square feet on the second floor.
   The two stores are linked by escalator and elevator, and they
also share a freight elevator.
   ``It's working well for both of us so far,'' said Good Guys
President Ron Unkefer. The Good Guys store at Stonestown opened
three months prior to Tower Records' opening.
   The arrangement has also worked thus far for Tower, although it
will be about a year before the store's performance can be properly
evaluated, said Mike Sullivan, vice president.
   Sacramento-based Tower Records is a $380 million chain with 50
stores in the United States and eight overseas. The Good Guys is a
17-store, $150 million chain based in Burlingame.
   Tower Records opened its Stonestown store in late November, and
the Good Guys store manager said he noticed an immediate impact on
sales during the first weekend.
   ``I've seen an amazing change in the traffic pattern,'' said
McNeill, who's managed five Good Guys stores. ``We probably saw
double what we've been seeing _ and we've been here since August.''
   He said his salesmen advise customers who purchase hardware at
The Good Guys to go upstairs and buy the software at Tower Records
so they can immediately try out their product. He added that
customers are cross-shopping, or browsing from store to store.
   Linking the two stores resulted almost by accident, said Unkefer.
The Good Guys had located the prospective property, but the old I.
Magnin Building was too large to develop and the landlord only
wanted one entrance.
   Unkefer said he decided to proceed with the shared-leased plan
since the Good Guys and Tower Records already had a good
relationship _ they are neighbors in a number of communities and
Tower President Russ Solomon sits on the Good Guys board of
directors.
   A multimillion-dollar restoration of the building and about a
year of planning went into the project at Stonestown Galleria, a
sprawling shopping center on the southwestern corner of the city,
near San Francisco State University.
   Unkefer said there are no plans for similar ventures in the
future. ``But we're both viewing this as a test ... that we
certainly could do (again) in other cities and other markets.''
   In any case, Unkefer said customers can only benefit from such
shared-lease arrangements.
   ``Everything that's in the building is fun to buy. It's one-stop
shopping for home entertainment,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airlines Ready to End Triple Mileage, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's major airlines are ready to end their
triple mileage programs _ but only if all the carriers do so,
according to some airline officials.
   The programs, in which airlines give frequent fliers three miles
of credit for each mile they fly, have been popular with the flying
public and costly for the major carriers.
   Delta Air Lines introduced triple mileage about a year ago, and
the others quickly followed suit.
   ``Triple miles truly sent a shock through the airline industry
and through American Airlines,'' Michael Gunn, American's senior
vice president of marketing, told The Dallas Morning News. ``It was
fundamentally unsound from an economic standpoint.''
   Delta's frequent flier membership increased by 2.5 million during
1988, and American's jumped by 1.5 million, The Morning News
reported in Sunday's editions.
   Last April, several carriers announced changes that effectively
pulled in the reins on free flying. And airlines could be ready now
to eliminate the triple mileage programs entirely, some experts say.
   ``Triple miles will pass into legend on Dec. 31st,'' Matt
Guilfoyle, Delta's director of consumer marketing, said last week.
   As Delta proved a year ago, only one airline has to break away
from the herd to start a stampede.
   ``There will be a move to slowly _ and I mean slowly _ tighten
the use of frequent flier mileage,'' said Paul Karos, an airline
analyst with First Boston Corp. ``But the airlines aren't going to
be able to get rid of the programs totally, nor would they want to.
They're a good marketing tool.''
   Analysts estimate that the potential cost of all frequent flier
miles _ when translated into free tickets and service upgrades _
could approach $1 billion. As much as half of that total is
attributable to triple mileage bonuses.
   At the same time, it appears increasingly likely that the
organization that sets accounting standards for U.S. businesses, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, will soon
require airlines to list their potential frequent flier liabilities
on their balance sheets.
   In response, airlines are likely to find ways to remove the
mileage awards from their books, by putting an expiration date on
miles already earned or by putting a time limit on the use of future
mileage awards.
   Airlines also are increasing the use of ``blackout dates'' _
popular travel periods when tickets obtained as frequent flier
awards cannot be used _ and capacity control. With capacity control,
airlines limit the number of seats on each flight to be given away
to frequent fliers.

<TEXT>
   The earnings outlook for the newspaper business
is expected to brighten next year despite what may be a shaky start
provided the economy avoids falling into a recession.
   That appeared to be the consensus among newspaper executives and
securities analysts who attended last week's PaineWebber Inc. media
conference.
   ``We are at the bottom of a trough right now and after a tough
first quarter, earnings should improve,'' said Edward Atorino, who
follows the media business for the investment firm Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   Atorino said the newspaper companies should post earnings gains
from operations for all of 1989 that should average about 7 percent
to 8 percent compared with flat to lower performances in 1988.
   J. Kendrick Noble, the media analyst for PaineWebber and the
organizer of the 16th annual conference, said earnings may grow 10
percent next year mainly due to improved operating results.
   Noble said the major newspaper companies were able to post 10
percent earnings gains in 1988, but said most of the improvement was
due to the lower corporate tax rate while operating results were
steady.
   Knight Ridder Inc., Gannett Co. and New York Times Co., for
instance, each said they expected lower earnings in the first
quarter of 1989 but improvement for the rest of the year. Dow Jones
& Co. expects improved results at all of its operations next year
barring a recession, and Times-Mirror Co. said cost-containment
programs will help it post modest gains in 1989.
   Atorino said the main reason most newspaper companies expect a
tough first quarter is that the first three months of 1988 were
unusually strong.
   But the performance at most newspaper companies for the rest of
the year fell off sharply because of a decline in retail advertising
and increases in newsprint costs.
   The decline in retail advertising, a major contributor to most
newspapers' revenue, has been blamed on consolidation in the
retailing business, resistance to last spring's women's fashions and
possibly greater selectivity by consumers in a delayed response to
the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Atorino noted that newspaper profits were pressured by two
increases in 18 months in newsprint prices, which represents a
significant cost to publishers.
   He said the combination of lower ad revenue and higher newsprint
costs produced ``the most difficult year in 10 years'' for the
newspaper business.
   But Atorino and Noble said that after getting past the first
quarter, newspaper executives have good reason to be optimistic
about the year.
   Atorino said advertising revenue for newpapers should rise by
about 6 percent next year, up from about 4 percent in 1988.
   Noble expects classified advertising will grow at a slower pace
than this year, retail advertising should be about the same and
national advertising in newspapers should pick up after no growth
this year. He expects little change in overall ad revenue growth.
   But Noble said he expects a 6 percent increase in circulation
revenue, reflecting 1 percent real growth and rate hikes of about 5
percent.
   On the cost side, the analysts said newspapers should benefit
from cost-containment programs already in place, modest growth in
labor costs and smaller increases if any in newsprint prices.
   Noble said the industry has had to absorb newsprint price hikes
averaging 10 percent over the past two years but noted that there
are some doubts that the 4.5 percent hike posted by some major
producers for early 1989 will in fact take effect.
   Labor costs, on the other hand, should rise by a modest 3 percent
to 4 percent, Noble said.
   The net result, Atorino said, is that the combination of slightly
improved ad revenue, higher circulation revenue and slow growth in
labor and newsprint costs should lead to improving earnings.
   ``There is almost unanimous hope that business will be better in
'89,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran Finds Big New Oil, Gas Reserves</HEAD>

   Iran has discovered new oil fields with an
estimated 10 billion barrels, substantially boosting the country's
oil reserves, Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh announced Sunday.
   He said in an interview with Iran's state-run television,
monitored in Nicosia, that a major discovery was made at Koohe Mand
southeast of the northern Persian Gulf port of Bushehr.
   ``We have hit light and heavy crude (oil), and have discovered
substantial deposits of oil totalling 10 billion barrels,'' Aqazadeh
said.
   ``This is a new kind of discovery for our country, because we
have found very heavy crude of a kind which we did not have.''
   The oil discoveries will bolster Iran's efforts to finance its
reconstruction following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in its gulf war with
Iraq.
   The Koohe Mand discovery will increase Iran's current estimated
oil reserves of 93 billion barrels by more than 10 percent.
   Aqazadeh said that in addition to oil, a recent discovery of
``vast deposits of natural gas in Assaluyeh ... will boost our
natural gas reserves substantially.''
   The Iranian Oil Ministry disclosed in August that the gas find,
about 44 miles southeast of the big Kangan-Nar gas fields in the
central gulf, has a production capacity of 26 million cubic meters a
day.
   ``There might be further reserves deeper down,'' Aqazadeh noted.
   Iran's total gas reserves are estimated at more than 13 trillion
cubic meters.
   Aqazadeh said additional oil exploration projects were underway
in the Caspian Sea in northern Iran, as well as in the gulf. The
Iranians are likely to develop Caspian fields in cooperation with
the Soviet Union.
   He said ``work on the bottom of the Caspian Sea has also been
completed, and we hope to have a rig in place by next year in
cooperation with the Soviets. Soon after that, we hope to start our
drilling operations there.''
   Aqazadeh also referred to another recent oil find in Kheyrabad in
central Fars province, southeast of Shiraz.
   ``Preliminary exploration has put the capacity of the Kheyrabad
find at 200 million barrels of oil a day,'' he said. ``Due to the
high pressure of the deposits there, the first well should yield
about 400,000 barrels of oil a day.''

<HEAD>Mexico to Cut Debt Payments by 50 Percent, Specialists Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico hopes to reduce payments on its foreign
debt by 50 percent in negotiations next year, the government
newspaper El Nacional on Sunday quoted private debt specialists as
saying.
   In its lead front-page story, the newspaper quoted the sources as
saying a 30 percent cut was feasible within a ``realistic term.''
The sources were not identified.
   They predicted that an agreement on reducing debt payments as of
1990 would be reached in the first two months of next year, the
newspaper said.
   Mexico's payments this year on its $102 billion foreign debt are
expected to total $14 billion.
   Last week, Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said the country would
seek a reduction in debt service from the current level, the
equivalent of 5 percent of gross domestic product, to 3 percent of
GDP.

<HEAD>Bass Group Names Antoci to Head American Savings and Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bass Group announced Sunday that Mario Antoci
will become chairman and chief executive officer of American Savings
and Loan before the year's end.
   Antoci, 54, now president and chief operating officer of H.F.
Ahmanson and Co., will assume the new post when the acquisition of
American Savings is completed by the Bass Group.
   ``Mario has demonstrated that a thrift can prosper in its
traditional role _ generating home mortgages with terms and pricing
that will meet consumer demands. His knowledge of the market and
reputation are excellent,'' Robert Bass said in an announcement.
   Antoci's experience includes a term with Home Savings and Loan,
an H.F. Ahmanson holding. Home Savings became the largest
home-mortgage lender in the thrift industry and the second-largest
resident mortgage lender nationally during Antoci's 21-year tenure.
   In a related announcement, Bass said William Popejoy, the current
chief executive officer of American Savings, will join an afiliate
of the Bass Group as a principal after working with Antoci in the
transition process. Popejoy will remain on the board of directors at
American Savings.
   ``The branch network (of American Savings) is solid, the
California industry is strong, and the thrift has an excellent
reputation for service,'' Antoci said. ``Most important, the Bass
commitment to the institution should provide confidence for
American's costumers and the financial strength to expand.''
   Antoci was named president and chief operating officer of Home
Savings in January 1984. In January 1987, he assumed the same
position with the parent company.
