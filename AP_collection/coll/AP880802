   Two prison guards were hospitalized in good
condition Tuesday and three other guards and one inmate were
treated for minor injuries and released after a 14-hour
hostage-taking ended in the early morning.
   The handful of prisoners who had taken control of the 32-inmate
special housing unit at Coxsackie Correctional Facility in Greene
County released the last four of the five guards about 12:45 a.m.
Tuesday.
   ``I think they got tired,'' said Corrections Commissioner Thomas
Coughlin. ``I think they felt very strongly that they were in over
their heads after the initial assaults.''
   Coughlin and Gov. Mario Cuomo told a state Capitol news
conference that they believed the incident, which began about 10:30
a.m. Monday, was an unorganized chain of events that escalated
faster than the inmates intended.
   ``What we're dealing with is a mob,'' Coughlin said. ``It was a
bunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32. There was no
planning, there was no organization. They knocked an officer down,
they took two other officers' nightsticks and they said, `Oh my
God, look what we've done now.'''
   According to Corrections Department records, the oldest inmate
in the unit is 26 years old and most of the prisoners are in their
upper teens or early 20s. The prison 20 miles south of Albany has
951 inmates.
   All the inmates remained locked in their cells Tuesday,
according to Corrections Department spokesman James Flateau.
   Coughlin said investigators hadn't determined how many inmates
were involved in the uprising. If those involved can be identified,
Coughlin said he hoped they would be charged.
   The inmates were armed with nightsticks, he said.
   Officials have not determined the cause of the uprising, but it
started when an inmate overpowered guard Lewis Bloom in a
recreation yard.
   On Monday, Flateau said some inmates had been complaining about
verbal harassment by guards, but Cuomo said Tuesday that the
uprising was not a response to any specific incident.
   Guard David Pratt, 31, of Coxsackie, was in good condition
Tuesday with abdominal injuries at Albany Medical Center Hospital,
said hospital spokeswoman Peggy Pitcher. A guard freed Monday
night, Warren Agostinoni, 28, of Cairo, was in good condition with
cuts and bruises, she said.
   Bloom and two other guards were released Tuesday morning after
treatment for bruises and cuts and an inmate was treated and
released for chest and back injuries, she said.

   Author and poet Raymond Carver,
acclaimed for his short stories about the difficulties of love and
financial problems in the lives of ordinary people, died at his
home here Tuesday of cancer at age 50.
   ``He died very nobly,'' said his brother-in-law Douglas Unger, a
creative writing professor at Syracuse University. ``He didn't let
on how bad his condition was.''
   Unger called Carver ``the greatest short story writer in North
America. He was the great innovator of the short story.''
   His most recent short story collection, titled ``Where I'm
Calling From,'' was published earlier this year by Atlantic Monthly
Press, and about the same time, he was named to the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in a ceremony in New York.
   His first collection of stories, ``Will You Please Be Quiet,
Please?,'' was published in 1976 and was nominated in 1977 for a
National Book Award. Critics praised the power and economy of the
writing.
   In January 1983, Carver became the one of the first recipients
of the Mildred and Harold Strauss Livings Award, a renewable,
tax-free stipend given by the American Academy amd Institute of
Arts and Letters that provides $35,000 a year for five years.
   Carver's other awards include a Wallace Stegner fellowship in
1972, a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 1971, a
Guggenheim Foundation fellowship in 1979 and a 1987 Governor's
Writers Award from Washington Gov. Booth Gardner. His works won O.
Henry awards in 1974, 1975 and 1980.
   His other published books include ``What We Talk About When We
Talk About Love'' (1981), ``Cathedral'' (1983) and ``Fires''
(1983). A book of his poetry, ``Ultramarine,'' was published in
1986.
   Carver was born in Clatskanie, Ore., and grew up in Yakima,
Wash, where his father was a saw-filer in a lumber mill and his
mother occasionally worked as a waitress or retail clerk.
   Carver studed writing through a correspondence course while
still in high school. After graduating from high school in 1956 he
worked for six months at a sawmill in Chester, Calif., and in 1957
married Maryann Burk. They later divorced.
   Carver moved in 1958 to California and took an introductionary
fiction-writing course from the late author John Gardner. He
transferred to Humboldt State, and his work began to be published
during his undergraduate years.
   He graduated from Humboldt in 1963 and attended the University
of Iowa from 1963 to 1964.
   Later in the 1960s he worked for three years as a night janitor
at a Sacramento hospital and wrote during the day.
   Carver once said he did not believe fiction had to bring about
personal, moral or social change.
   ``It just has to be there for the fierce pleasure we take in
doing it, and the different kind of pleasure that's taken in
reading something that's durable and made to last, as well as
beautiful in and of itself,'' he said. ``Something that throws off
these sparks _ a persistent and steady glow, however dim.''
   Carver taught writing at various schools and was a professor of
English at Syracuse University in Syracuse, N.Y., for three years
until 1983, and his wife, the poet and short story writer Tess
Gallagher, continued to teach there.
   Carver and Ms. Gallagher made their home in this small city on
the northern Olympic Penninsula from December through August each
year.
   Survivors in addition to Ms. Gallagher were his mother, Ella
Carver; a son, Vance Carver of Germany; a daughter, Christine
Carver of Bellingham; three grandchildren; and a brother, James
Carver.
   A graveside service is scheduled here for Thursday.

   In the looking-glass world of U.N.
diplomacy, words don't always mean what you think, speakers don't
always say what they mean and the most admired skill is reading
between the lines.
   The most popular pastime is dissecting the statements of
diplomats, deciding what is hard-line rhetoric for the benefit of
people back home and TV cameras here and what really is going on.
   What one envoy says on Monday is not necessarily what he means
on Tuesday, and principle very often is negotiable.
   Diplomats also know that what is said in the secretary-general's
art-filled 38th floor office seldom decides the fate of nations,
but reflects decisons made elsewhere.
   In the Iran-Iraq war, for example, public statements before a
battery of microphones and television cameras outside U.N.
headquarters indicate serious problems in the negotiations.
   A stumbling block has emerged over direct talks, which Iraq says
it wants before a cease-fire and which Iran says it wants only
after a cease-fire.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar counsels patience and
says he is working on compromises to resolve ``procedural
difficulties.''
   Diplomats listen, then consider formulas that could accommodate
both sides. Despite strident statements, very few things are
immutable here and concessions are part of the game.
   There is speculation the secretary-general could announce a
cease-fire date but leave time before it takes effect. That could
please Iran.
   In the interim, diplomats say, he could persuade Iran to agree
to direct talks with Iraq before a cease-fire takes hold. That
would please Iraq.
   Or the U.N. chief could persuade the five permanent members of
the Security Council to guarantee a cease-fire, as proposed by
Iraq. Iraq then might relent in its demand for immediate
face-to-face talks. That would please Iran and many other nations
and give Iraq its guarantee.
   In another scenario, Iraq could observe a de facto cease-fire
without any formal acceptance. Then it wouldn't violate its own
demand for talks before a cease-fire.
   Iran says it could favorably consider direct talks ``at an
acceptable level'' after a cease-fire, troop withdrawal and
prisoner exchange.
   But does it mean the announcement of a cease-fire or its actual
implementation? That's subject to negotiation.
   Deciphering statements at the U.N. often requires comparing them
with statements from the home front.
   On July 18, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, said Iran would reverse its position and accept Security
Council Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire and other
measures to end the war.
   He said accepting the year-old resolution was like ``swallowing
poison.''
   Iran has said it wants an immediate cease-fire and has no
tactical or other motivations in seeking lasting peace. But on
Tuesday, Iranian President Ali Khamenei said prospects for and end
to the 8-year-old war were ``extremely doubtful.''
   Iran's deputy foreign minister sowed more confusion over the
weekend when he said Iran has ``no obstables'' to direct talks.
   After more than a week of separate talks between the
secretary-general and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, the discussions are moving
slowly.
   Both sides proclaim they never will change their positions,
firmly and nobly grounded in the best interests of their people.
But neither Iranian nor Iraqi envoys appear willing give a simple
``yes'' or ``no'' answer to a simple question.
   For example, reporters recently asked Iranian Ambassador
Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati whether Iran would accept direct talks
if the secretary-general requests it.
   Answer: ``We will do whatever is necessary to implement
Resolution 598. We cooperate fully with the secretary-general, but
cannot accept preconditions.''
   Q: Does that mean you will you meet face-to-face with Iraq if
asked to do so by the secretary-general?
   A: ``Our statement speaks for itself.''
   Reporters asked Iraqi envoy Riyadh al-Qaysi, a former U.N.
ambassador, what Iraq would do if the secretary-general announces a
date to begin a cease-fire without direct talks.
   A: ``You have heard my statement. The answer is included
therein. We will not accept a fait accompli, no matter in what form
or from which quarter it comes.''
   Reporters then asked the secretary-general for his reaction.
   A: ```Fait accompli' is French. ... I don't know if he
understands properly `fait accompli's'' meaning. ... We are
negotiating for two weeks on the possibility of cease-fire ... and
I think `fait accompli' is a little (use) of (the) imagination of
those who use the word and don't know what it means.''

<DATELINE>ON A MOBILE BASE IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks of calm in
the ``tanker war'' is no assurance of peace to American servicemen
sweltering on barges that serve as U.S. Navy bases in the northern
Persian Gulf.
   By day, Navy commandos called Seals use patrol boats to check
out dhows and fishing boats that either venture too close or might
be sowing mines.
   At night, Army helicopters skim over the water in near silence,
observing shipping activity with night-vision gear that reveals
even the smallest craft in ghostly, green detail.
   ``As far as we're concerned, nothing's changed,'' said the
commander of the barge Winbrown 7, a Navy officer who identified
himself only as Gary. ``Until we hear otherwise, we'll just
continue to operate as we have been.''
   Winbrown 7 is one of two commercial barges the Navy hired 10
months ago as ``mobile sea bases'' to support Operation Earnest
Will, the escorting of 11 Kuwaiti tankers given U.S. registration
and American flags.
   The barge bases, equipped with communications gear and a variety
of weapons, were conceived as a stopgap after Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia rejected U.S. requests for land bases.
   American officers say a subsequent decline in Iranian attacks on
neutral shipping in the northern gulf demonstrates the barges have
a ``deterrence effect'' far beyond original expectations.
   Both barges fly Panamanian flags and are anchored in
international waters outside Saudi Arabia's 12-mile limit. They are
within 40 miles of Farsi Island, a base used by Iran's
Revolutionary Guards for speedboat attacks on commercial ships
trading with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   Attacks around Farsi tapered off in late 1987. None were
reported this year until the weeks before Iran announced July 18
that it would accept a year-old U.N. Security Council proposal for
a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   No attacks in the Persian Gulf by either side have been reported
since the Iranian declaration.
   U.S. officers say neither Winbrown 7 nor Hercules, the other
barge farther north, has ever been threatened.
   An officer on Winbrown 7 named Alex said the Iranians presumably
know the barges exist, since ``we're in their backyard, and we
don't think they're foolish or stupid.''
   ``From what we can determine, Iran has been unable to lay mines
or attack shipping to the extent it did before and has had to focus
its efforts elsewhere,'' he said.
   A ring of floating anti-missile reflectors around the barges are
said to generate radar images several times their actual size to
fool incoming missiles. Except for those and the guns, the barges
resemble the oil platforms and seagoing derricks that dot the gulf.
   Officials in Washington acknowledged their existence last year,
but Navy officers based in the gulf have refused to discuss the
barge operation, its cost or the fact that Kuwait pays the bill.
   A senior Navy officer whose responsibilities include the entire
Persian Gulf said barge personnel are so security-conscious that
``nobody's welcome there, not even us.''
   The approximately 200 soldiers, sailors and Marines on each
barge get no shore leave during duty tours of 90 to 120 days, and
cannot tell their families where they are or what they are doing.
   Living conditions are cramped and spartan, and temperatures
usually top 100 degrees. But Gary, the commander, said Winbrown 7
has ``better food than any Navy ship.''
   Two chow lines, ``one spicy and one regular,'' meet the needs of
both the military and about 50 Indian and Filipino civilian workers
living aboard, he said. U.S. officials say the workers are given
security screenings.
   Alex described his assignment as ``out here on the pointy end of
the stick'' where ``it's hot, it's lonely, and it's hot.'' He said
recreation sometimes includes swimming in ``the world's biggest
warm water pool.''
   Last week, when Pentagon officials lifted secrecy enough to
permit four journalists to visit Winbrown 7 for the first time, the
rules specified no last names and no full-face pictures of men in
sensitive roles.
   The reception was coolly polite, but some officers could not
conceal their displeasure that the Pentagon was exposing a secret
operation to journalists.
   A lieutenant colonel who commands the Army helicopters prefaced
his briefing with: ``First, I want to know why we're doing this.''
   He said publicity might endanger his pilots' lives. Because they
operate only at night, he would not let his men make a daytime
flight for television cameras.
   The helicopters, highly-classified versions of OH-58 scout
aircraft, recently replaced smaller MH-6 Seabats on the barges. One
pilot said the choppers are so stealthy that fishermen and others
in small craft rarely if ever spot them.
   ``I've watched them pulling in their nets but I've never seen
them look up,'' he said ``As far as I can tell they never know
we're here.''
   Journalists were taken on a run in the Seals' 65-foot Mark III
patrol boat. A sign in the cockpit said: ``This operation is so
secret that even I don't know what I'm doing.''

   Detroit voters turned thumbs-down on
casino gambling Tuesday, while Republicans statewide chose former
congressma Jim Dunn to challenge Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle.
   Dunn and Robert Huber, both millionaires, spent about $200,000
each trying to attract support for an underdog race against Riegle,
a popular liberal who had no primary opposition in his bid for a
third term
   With 31 percent of the precincts reporting, Dunn had 80,577
votes or 62 percent to Huber's 48,744 votes or 38 percent.
   The referendum on casino gambling was put on the ballot by
opponents of the plan championed by Mayor Coleman Young. He
believes casinos can bring desperately needed money into the city
and help lower its 9.6 percent unemployment rate.
   With 21 percent of precincts reporting, a measure to ban
gambling was winning by 14,050 votes or 64 percent to 7,793 votes
or 36 percent.
   Detroit also had a lively congressional primary. Four-term Rep.
George Crockett was challenged by City Council member Barbara-Rose
Collins and two lesser-known Democratic hopefuls. He was the only
U.S. House incumbent with primary opposition.

<TEXT>
   Young's opponents included many of the ministers and church
members who in the past have formed the core of his constituency.
   A Saturday rally turned into a public shouting match between
pro-casino and anti-casino forces, and all over the city preachers
used their pulpits to make one last anti-casino pitch on Sunday.
   Casinos have already been rejected twice by voters, and it would
require action by the Legislature to legalize gambling anywhere in
Michigan.
   Huber, who was in Congress for the 1973-74 term, and Jim Dunn,
who served in the 1981-82 term, both criticized Riegle as too
liberal for the state.
   Dunn devoted most of his energy to mending fences with the party
leaders he publicly criticized during his unsuccessful 1984 Senate
primary race.
   Huber, the more conservative of the two, emphasized his
opposition to abortion as he spent the bulk of his time trying to
endear himself to the partisans brought into the party by Pat
Robertson's presidential campaign.

   Here are key events in the history of the West
Bank of the Jordan River, occupied by Israel since 1967:
   1918 _ British Gen. Edmund Allenby defeats Turkish forces in a
battle south of the West Bank city of Nablus.
   1923 _ The League of Nations gives Britain the mandate over
Palestine, an area that includes the East Bank of the Jordan River.
Palestinian leaders protest the decision and demand independence.
Later that year, Britain effectively partitions Palestine, handing
over the East Bank to Emir Abdullah.
   1946 _ The East Bank becomes the Hashemite Kingdom of
Transjordan.
   1947 _ The United Nations votes to end the British mandate and
partitions Palestine. Immediately after the decision, fighting
erupts between Palestinians and Jews. Jewish fighters establish
themselves in most areas accorded them in the partition plan.
   1948 _ After Israel declares independence in May, Arab armies
cross the border and attack Israeli forces. The Arab Legion wins
control over most lands accorded to the Palestinians in the U.N.
partition plan.
   1950 _ Jordan annexes the West Bank.
   1967 _ The Israeli army captures Arab east Jerusalem and the
West Bank from Jordan. Israel initiates an open-bridge policy
allowing West Bank Palestinians to maintain close ties with Jordan.
   1974 _ Arab leaders attending a summit in Rabat determine that
the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people, formally divesting Jordan
of this role.
   1987 _ In December, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
launch a popular uprising against the Israeli occupation and demand
an independent state.
   1988 _ Arab leaders reaffirm the Rabat agreement. On July 31,
King Hussein announces that Jordan will cut legal and
administrative ties with the West Bank. As a first step, he cancels
a $1.3 billion development plan for the West Bank and dissolves the
lower house of Parliament, consisting of 50 percent of legislators
from the occupied lands.

   President Reagan sees communism on the
run, Jimmy Carter is concerned about another oil crisis, and Gerald
Ford worries about ``an economic time bomb'' exploding if the
nation's deficit keeps expanding.
   They, along with former President Nixon, are among 47 of the
nation's top statesmen and scholars who peer into the 1990s in a
cautionary, mostly conservative guidebook to the future released
for review Monday.
   ``We must not fall into the trap of thinking that a reduction in
U.S.-Soviet tensions means the end of the conflict,'' Nixon warns
in ``Thinking About America _ The United States in the 1990s.''
   Nixon has the first word and Reagan the last in this collection
of essays that also includes observations by Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young, Secretary of State George Shultz, Soviet writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, Attorney General Edwin Meese and three Nobel
Prize-winning economists.
   The 590-page book, which goes on sale in September, was
published by the influential Hoover Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace.
   A similar collection of essays by the think tank eight years ago
served as a blueprint for the Reagan administration, according to
one reader who is quoted in the introduction to the current book _
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Despite a few pieces by liberals and moderates, most of the
contributors are conservatives.
   Physicist and ``Star Wars'' defense advocate Edward Teller,
former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, and former national
security adviser Richard V. Allen write about the need for strong
defense. Special envoy Philip Habib discusses the world's trouble
spots.
   Other essays focus on foreign policy, national security,
international economic issues, domestic policy and national purpose
and philosophical views on peace, prosperity and liberty.
   Reagan claims he succeeded with ``three urgent foreign policy
tasks'' he faced in 1981: to restore the nation's economic strength
and reinvigorate the world economy; to rebuild U.S. military
strength; and to restore America's self-confidence.
   Reagan sees the world heading into the ``Information Age'' with
great advances to come in computers and telecommunications that
will play a large role in opening up communist countries.
   He argues ``it is no coincidence that this new burst of
innovation has originated in the free nations, where knowledge and
information flow freely...''
   The communist system faces a dilemma because of information
technology, he says. If it allows technology to develop for
economic growth, it risks challenges to the party's monopoly of
power. If it resists modernization for fear of losing political
control, it will fall farther behind.
   ``Probably it has no choice,'' he says. ``These regimes will
find they cannot resist the forces of change and the power of the
human spirit.''
   Carter warns of threats to civil liberties when ``well-meaning
people look for simple solutions to their problems.''
   He hopes for improved relations with the Soviet Union but says
the United States must be cautious in negotiations with Gorbachev.
   The United States also must ``accommodate the burgeoning
influence of such countries as China, Japan and Brazil,'' he says,
``and deal with a more tightly aligned Europe that is already
looking eastward and becoming equivocal about its singular
commitments to the West.''
   He said the United States could face another energy crisis in
the 1990s and must overcome ``a lackadaisical attitude (that) is
now causing a disturbing reversal of our nation's domestic
production and importation of foreign oil.''
   Ford says the nation's deepening debt poses a more serious
problem.
   ``Mark my words,'' he writes, ``unless we as a nation face up to
the facts of fiscal reality and responsibility, and the sacrifices
required to restore it, the economic time bomb we are sitting on
will do us in as surely as any sudden enemy assault.''
   Nixon proposes bolstering American conventional forces in
Europe, Korea and the Persian Gulf and argues that the United
States ``must take advantage of Moscow's flagging economic strength
to improve our own competive position around the world.''
   He also advises Michael Dukakis and George Bush to campaign for
``a new America,'' recalling that was suggested to him by France's
Charles de Gaulle in 1959.
   ``As vice president, I could not take advantage of that advice,
for it would appear I was repudiating President Eisenhower,'' Nixon
recalled. ``But John Kennedy did run on that theme, and he won.''

<TEXT>
   Seoul wants to be a clean, green
municipal machine by the time the Summer Olympics hit town, even if
it means evicting some slum dwellers and putting a lid on the
city's worst polluters.
   The city, seeking to shine during its stint in the limelight, is
in the midst of an enormous spruce-up campaign that includes
curbing its wreckless drivers and urging its restaurant patrons to
use better table manners.
   ``I find Seoul citizens quite cooperative with what the city
government is doing,'' says Seoul Mayor Kim Yong-nae.
   The South Korean capital's 10 million residents are being asked
to make more than a few sacrifices for the games, which run from
Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   Highway use, for example, will be rationed. Private cars,
depending on their license numbers, will be only allowed to drive
on odd- and even-numbered days during the games.
   In the meantime, scores of citizens have been cleaning and
painting to brighten the city, and officials say 125,000 trees have
been planted.
   Highways, subways, pollution control, street lighting, flood
control and housing all have been improved since Seoul was chosen
as the 1988 Olympic host seven years ago, said researcher Kang
Hong-bin of the Korea National Housing Corp.
   But construction has led to the eviction of about 100,000 people
from slum areas, says Kim Kwang-soo, secretary-general of the Korea
Council of Christian Urban Poor Missions. The evictions have
prompted periodic demonstrations.
   Although not all the redevelopment projects been officially
linked to the games, squatters claim that to some degree the
international event is behind all the beautification projects _ and
the evictions.
   Kim Kwang-Soo says there have been evictions from areas near the
Olympic rowing course, the field hockey stadium, the equestrian
competition sites and athletes' village.
   But the mayor said the city cannot leave people in illegally
built, unsanitary housing that may collapse during rainy season
downpours. New housing will be built and housing subsidies will be
boosted for poor families, he maintained in a recent interview.
   The overall price tag for the Games in this economically
thriving city about 30 miles from the North Korean border is
generally given as $3.1 billion.
   About $1.4 billion is money the government is spending on such
projects as subway and airport expansion and the cleanup of the Han
River, which runs through the center of the city.
   The rest of the costs are covered by Olympic revenue or private
investment.
   A record 12,000 athletes from 161 nations are expected, along
with 230,000 sports officials, specialists and tourists, among
others. An estimated 4,650 volunteers will work at Olympic jobs as
guides, interpreters and custodians.
   Seoul also wants to clean up its air by closing factories and
reducing traffic, much as Los Angeles did when it hosted the 1984
games.
   A booklet published by Seoul's government says ``industries
known for polluting the air will be temporarily closed.''
   Subway and bus runs will be expanded to curb private vehicle use
and companies will be encouraged to give vacations. Motorists are
being encouraged to use unleaded gasoline, the mayor said.
   ``Seoul has been rather notorious for crazy drivers,'' he said,
but efforts are being made to enforce rules and smooth traffic flow.
   Kim, a presidential appointee who has been mayor since December,
said he also expects construction projects to be halted during the
games to cut down on noise and dust.
   The Korean press has frequently mentioned ``questionable''
hygienic standards in restaurants and ``the prevalent habit of
(diners) throwing waste paper ... on the floor.''
   The city is demanding cleaner kitchens and restrooms and has
selected 3,000 of the city's some 100,000 restaurants ``as models
of a sanitary restaurant where foreigners can enjoy Korea's
traditional food.''
   Such restaurants now have signs in Korean saying ``model
restaurant,'' and Kim said eateries will be asked to add foreign
languages to their menus.

   Here are excerpts from ``Thinking About
America _ The United States in the 1990s,'' published by the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:
   _President Reagan: ``It is always perilous to try to peer into
the future, but for the statesman, this peril is an occupational
hazard. To be successful, the statesman must design policies not
only to meet the needs of today, but to anticipate _ if not shape _
the pattern of tomorrow.''
   _President Ford: ``We cannot go on living beyond our means by
borrowing from future generations or being bailed out by foreign
investors.''
   _President Nixon: ``(Gorbachev) knows that the problems he faces
will require at least a generation to solve. He needs a generation
of peace ... If we have only 20 years before a reinvigorated Soviet
Union turns its sights on renewed expansion, we have no time to
lose. We must think boldly and act boldly. We must seek to shape
the world; but we should not seek to remake the world in our
image.''
   _President Carter: ``If present trends are not reversed by
market forces or strong government action before 1995, two-thirds
of the United States' oil will be imported, amounting to more than
12 million barrels per day. There is some doubt that this much will
be readily available to us from overseas, a situation that could
result in competition for scarce supplies, substantial increases in
energy prices, and another wave of worldwide inflation.''
   _Special Envoy Philip C. Habib: ``There is no sign that the
bloody war between Iran and Iraq will end before 1990 ... There
will be periods of greater or lesser action, but neither side seems
capable of a sudden victory. Even a change in circumstances, such
as the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini or economic or military
sanctions, cannot readily resolve the dispute. Iranian demands are
unacceptable to Iraq, and Iraqui militay capabilities remain
formidable and sustainable.''
   _Secretary of State George Shultz: ``The Soviet Union will
remain our central security concern for the foreseeable future.
U.S. military strength, our framework of alliances, and our other
security ties remain central to peace in the world. But there is
also emerging a new dynamism in the East-West relationship.''
   _Economist James M. Buchanan: ``The economic constitution of the
United States is in disarray in the late 1980s ... The flaw in
budget making is in procedure, not in policy; no amount of
legislative responsibility will set matters aright. Alongside the
deficit regime, we sit in fear of a post-Reagan resurgence of
envy-motivated exploitative marginal tax rates on income. We are
vulnerable precisely because we have not constitutionally defined
limit on absolute levels of taxation.''
   _President Ford: ``The war in Vietnam is receding into history,
but some important lessons remain to be learned from it _ more
political than military. The first is that a government in which
public opinion really matters cannot conduct sustained overseas
combat without substantial citizen support and clearly stated
objectives. This is particularly true when open telecommunications
direct a round-the-clock barrage of gory battle images into
citizens' homes and spread them simultaneously around the world.''
   _President Carter: ``It is obvious that one of the most
challenging opportunities for us is to reduce the level of
expenditures for armaments among all nations and devote at least a
portion of these financial resources to alleviate the problems of
poverty, starvation, and homelessness and to preventive health care
both at home and abroad. Only the United States could successfully
lead this effort.''
   _President Reagan: ``The new Soviet leaders say they are open to
`new thinking' and that they seek a breathing space internationally
so they can concentrate on economic reform at home. If so, our task
is to make clear their choice _ to ensure that adventurism has a
high cost and to maximize their incentives to help resolve those
regional conflicts rather than persist in the pursuit of military
solutions.''
   _President Nixon: ``If Gorbachev stresses the need to solve his
internal problems, we should not be conned into thinking that the
system has changed or that the threat to the West has ended.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Proxmire Protests Political Noise Pollution</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Noise. Screeching, yelling, bellowing,
desk-pounding noise.
   Noise, Sen. William Proxmire says, is invading political
discourse.
   Its inspiration: Well, perhaps it may be the influence of a
quarter-century of ear-blasting rock music upon the nation's young.
   ``Has the age of rock and roll so corrupted our generation with
noise that only the loudest shouters can win?'' Proxmire asked the
Senate on Monday.
   Or perhaps, the Wisconsin Democrat said, one can blame
television talk shows which elevate rudeness to a fine art and
operate under the rule of ``never start talking unless you are
butting in on another speaker.''
   ``If two speakers interrupt a third speaker simultaneously, and
all three keep taking, then you have the supreme thrill,'' Proxmire
said. ``Wth three people taking at once, it's impossible to hear a
coherent word, let alone a coherent sentence.''
   ``More and more people are catching on to this rock-and-roll
oratory,'' Proxmire told the Senate. ``They are finding it's a real
winner. Content is nothing. It doesn't matter whether the speaker
is logical or ridiculous.
   ``What matters is the loudness _ the decibels,'' Proxmire said,
his own voice rising to a shout.
   ``Does the speaker really get your attention?'' he bellowed to
the several senators on the floor at the time, and the galleries,
mostly filled with tourists from around the nation.
   ``Does he slam his fist on the table?'' the senator exclaimed,
slamming his own fist on his Senate desk.
   ``Does he stamp and shout?'' asked the senator, doing both at
the same time.
   ``Does his voice range from a roar to a screech and back to a
roar?'' he asked, roaring with the best of them.
   ``Does he flail the air with his fists?,'' he shouted, flailing
at the empty air next as if it were a punching bag.
   ``Does he slap his hands together and keep shouting?''
   He waved his arms above his head, slapped his hands together and
shouted: ``If he does all of these things, the press will call him
charismatic and more and more people will come to see him and hear
his noise.''
   These roaring thoughts on political noise and loudness were
ignited, Proxmire said, by a recent column on the subject by
Russell Baker of The New York Times, who said: ``Anybody who acts
as though noise were an argument instead of an assault is too far
behind the times to be rescued.''
   There are shouters in the Senate also.
   But Proxmire said the place is more often bound by ``slow and
sleepy'' oratorical tradition, conducted according to a gentlemanly
code in which speakers speak of each other as ``the distinguished''
and ``the honorable.''
   The future, however, may belong to ``the red hot shouters,''
Proxmire lamented.
   ``Whenever hot emotion and cold reasoning clash, hot emotion
wins every time.''
   ``I can just imagine this place 20 or 30 years from now _ let's
say in 2010,'' Proxmire said.
   ``The Senate chaplain will deliver a rock-and-roll, crowd
pleasing, shouting, morning prayer.
   ``The majority and minority leaders _ lacking the quiet dignity
of our present leaders _ will set the pace with a drum beat of
table pounding, shrill, rousing rhetoric.
   ``Result: This body will move from an ignored TV channel to big
time on TV ... the bawling, baying, bellowing, clamor and commotion
of the United States Senate will be on the air.''
   Having shouted his hope that the decibel level of political and
congressional oratory will be reduced, Proxmire lowered his voice
and ended his speech _ quietly.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., sought recognition and made clear
Proxmire's point had struck home.
   ``After the distinguished senator from Wisconsin's oration,'' he
said, ``I may deliver my speech in just a little above a whisper.''

<HEAD>Third World Debt Crisis Strikes Blow at U.S. Agriculture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debt crisis that has engulfed many
developing countries is striking a blow at U.S. agriculture,
shrinking the available supply of credit to purchase American
commodities.
   ``High interest rates, declining commodity prices and currency
devaluations in the 1980s have thrust much of the burden of the
world's economic problems on heavily indebted developing
countries,'' says an issue paper produced recently by USDA's
Economic Research Service.
   Between 1975 and 1987, the total debt of all non-industrial
countries rose from $234 billion to about $1.2 trillion, according
to the authors, Mathew Shane and David Stallings. It noted a jump
in debt service payments in the early 1980s from about 12 percent
of total exports to 25 percent.
   Latin American debt service payments have climbed from 20
percent to 40 percent, the paper said.
   To compound matters, commercial banks have withdrawn credit and
the indebted nations have forced a reduction in imports while
attempting to spur exports.
   These moves to limit imports represent a serious problem for
U.S. farmers, because the developing world represents the fastest
growing market for agricultural exports.
   Imports of American farm products leveled off six years ago and
there has been little change since, a marked contrast to the 1970s
when the developing world's share of U.S. exports ballooned from 25
percent to more than 40 percent.
   The United States has battled to maintain market share with
federal programs to stimulate exports. The issue paper describes as
especially effective programs that guarantee credit to overseas
customers. It also points to food aid programs as particularly
helpful.
   ``Nearly 50 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports to the
problem borrowers were shipped under federal export programs in
1983 and remained above 40 percent through 1986,'' the paper said.
Among countries that represent major markets for the United States,
about 30 percent of all U.S. farm goods imported received
government support.
   The figure for Latin America is 40 percent, according to the
paper, while less than 15 percent of those to Hong Kong, South
Korea and Taiwan have been financed through such programs.

   The Agriculture Department may reinstate
Mexico's eligibility to send beef, mutton, pork and goat products
to the United States.
   Mexico was dropped from eligibility in February 1984 because it
failed to meet provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act. In
specific, USDA said it lacked satisfactory testing for chemical
residues contained in the meat and species verification programs.
   ``A review team from USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service
has visited Mexico's residue-testing laboratory and several of its
meat plants and FSIS is assured that Mexico's inspection program
now meets U.S. standards,'' said Lester M. Crawford, FSIS
administrator.
   The United States probably will receive no more than 2.5 million
pounds of meat a year from Mexico, or about 0.03 percent of
domestic production.
   As a result, reinstating Mexico as a supplier will have no
effect on either the American industry or consumer prices, USDA
said.

   Plants that have been modified genetically and
their possible effects on agriculture, health and the environment
are the focus of a federal conference set for Sept. 7-9 in
Annapolis, Md.
   Development and use of genetically modified plants for food and
other commercial purposes will be a major part of the conference,
sponsored jointly by the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services.
   The sponsors have invited government officials and academic
experts as well as representatives from industry and consumer
groups and environmentalists. There will be presentations by
authorities in the development of so-called transgenic plants.
   The Agriculture Department said in a statement that a small
amount of data already is available from field tests of the ability
of transgenic plants to resist pests and tolerate pesticides. The
plants also are being studied by researchers seeking ways to
upgrade nutritional characteristics, USDA said.

   A frequent critic of federal air traffic
control efforts says a new government report showing a reduction in
near accidents is good news, but he says the system remains under
severe pressure.
   ``We're all happy to see it, but by no means are we ready to
celebrate,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the
Senate's transportation appropriations subcommittee, said Monday
after the Federal Aviation Administration released its figures.
   The FAA said there were 518 operational errors by air traffic
controllers during the first six months of this year, an 18 percent
drop from the 635 recorded in the first half of 1987.
   The 366 aerial near-collisions reported by pilots from January
through June this year was a 27 percent decline from the 500
reported during the same period in 1987.
   In addition, there were 60 reports of aircraft or ground
vehicles entering active runways without permission during the
first three months of 1988, 27 percent fewer than the 82 tallied in
the first quarter of 1987.
   ``These numbers, combined with the generally downward movement
in aircraft accident rates in the first half of 1988, indicate a
continued pattern of improvement in aviation safety,'' FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor said in a statement.
   But Lautenberg said the figures showed ``encouraging numbers,
not satisfactory numbers.''
   He said a military plane he was in last Friday flying to
Teterboro Airport in New Jersey had to veer off course to avoid
colliding with another aircraft that his pilot later told him had
been only 200 feet away.
   ``The system is under strain,'' he said.
   The frequency of operational errors, in which the required
spacing between aircraft in flight is violated, has been declining
since the middle of last year.
   But the number of aerial near-collisions has begun declining for
the first time in about five years, FAA spokesman John Leyden said.
The agency defines a near-collision as an incident in which two
aircraft come within 500 feet of each other in flight, or when
flight crews believe a hazard of a collision existed.
   Public concern about safety in the skies peaked last year.
Complaints from passengers surged, airliners crashed at the Detroit
and Denver airports and a helicopter carrying President Reagan
averted a collision with a small plane near his California ranch.
   The government, often under prodding from Congress, has taken
steps such as hiring additional air traffic controllers, changing
flight procedures around the country's largest airports and
requiring expanded use of devices that report an aircraft's
altitude.
   ``I think we can take some credit for this record of
improvement,'' McArtor said.
   Of the aerial near-collisions, 165 of the incidents involved at
least one airliner or smaller passenger plane, down from the 223
reported in the first half of 1987.
   The FAA does not yet have statistics available for the second
quarter of 1988 for incidents in which vehicles enter runways
without permission.

   The government should fingerprint truck and
bus operators or use even more sophisticated identification methods
to prevent the drivers from getting licenses from more than one
state, a trucking industry leader says.
   The president of the American Trucking Associations, Thomas J.
Donohue, criticized the Federal Highway Administration on Monday
for enacting regulations that require only that drivers' Social
Security numbers and physical descriptions be recorded.
   He said he was asking Congress to pass legislation that would
require the government to compile stricter identification
information, such as fingerprints or retinal images. Under that
technique, distinctive images are made electronically of a person's
eyes.
   ``It is irresponsible to do anything less than demand new
technology to solve our problem,'' Donohue said at a news
conference.
   Some truck and bus drivers avoid losing their licenses after
various safety convictions, such as for drug and alcohol abuse, by
obtaining licenses from several states. If they lose one, they
still have others.
   The Federal Highway Administration estimates there are 3 million
to 5 million truck and bus drivers in the country.
   A 1986 law now being phased in requires that truck and bus
drivers obtain special commercial licenses. It also makes it
illegal for a truck or bus driver to have a license from more than
one state. Donohue estimated that there are 900,000 bus and truck
operators with more than one license.
   Donohue said the Federal Highway Administration rules, issued
July 15, have ``a major flaw'' because it is easy to obtain several
licenses illegally.
   ``We all know you can go into any state in the union this
afternoon and get as many Social Security numbers as you want,'' he
said.
   Donohue, whose organization is the largest of the trucking
industry's trade groups, said fingerprinting or retinal imaging
would cost about $10 million to institute. The cost could be borne
by fees paid for truck and bus driver's licenses, he said.
   ``An investment of $10 million or $15 million in a system that
would keep the few really bad drivers off the road would seem to us
to be a reasonable thing to do,'' Donohue said.
   A Federal Highway Administration official said the agency
believes its current identification system is effective, and that
more advanced techniques may be in place by the 1990s.
   Richard Landis, associate administrator for motor carriers, said
the agency will be studying sophisticated identification methods
over the next two years and could propose new rules by 1990.
   Donohue said he is asking lawmakers to incorporate his proposal
into truck safety legislation the House Public Works Committee will
consider this month. Under his plan, states would have to select a
sophisticated identification technique by December 1989 and begin
using the process by October 1993.
   Donohue said his proposal was supported by 13 other highway user
and safety groups, including the National Safety Council. In
addition, Chairman Jim Burnett of the National Transportation
Safety Board, the federal agency that investigates accidents, has
expressed support for the idea.

<HEAD>EPA Fears Companies May Prolong CFC Production Due to Windfall
Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The possibility of reaping $7 billion in
windfall profits may lead chemical companies to prolong production
of compounds that destroy the Earth's protective ozone shield, the
Environmental Protection Agency fears.
   To encourage those producers to find substitutes for
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, the agency wants to
charge fees equal to the windfall earnings the manufacturers could
get as prices go up in the face of shortages of CFC compounds.
   An international treaty calls for a 50 percent reduction in CFC
production by 1998, and under EPA's expectations, the CFC shortages
will enable producers to raise prices with no increase in
production costs. The agency estimated the possible windfall at
$1.8 billion to $7.2 billion. The quicker substitutes are adopted,
the less the windfall.
   The agency gave notice Monday it was considering other
approaches: Auctions of the right to produce and direct regulation
of certain manufacturing processes that might require other
chemicals to be used instead.
   An official of the Office of Management and Budget said OMB
favored auctions and would press its view.
   ``We think the market ought to be allowed to do its work rather
than a bunch of bureaucrats like me,'' said Robert K. Dawson,
associate director of OMB. ``What is the evidence that we as a
federal government can allocate production equitably across firms?''
   The notices accompanied the agency's final promulgation of
quotas for CFC producers under the 1987 Montreal treaty requiring
the cuts in CFC production.
   EPA expects enough countries to ratify the Montreal treaty for
it to take effect next Jan. 1. Eleven nations accounting for
two-thirds of world production must ratify; six including the
United States have done so.
   The non-toxic, non-flammable and long-lived CFC compounds are
used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and blowing agents to make
plastic foams.
   CFCs eventually reach the ozone layer 15 miles to 25 miles high
that blocks the cancer-causing ultraviolet rays of the sun. There
the CFCs destroy ozone.
   Scientists blame CFCs for a roughly 2.5 percent decline in the
ozone layer since about 1960. EPA says each percent means 43,000
more cases of skin cancer in the United States, currently about
500,000 a year, and the regulations should prevent 3.7 million
early U.S. deaths among people living now and to be born before
2075.
   The five U.S. companies producing CFC compounds are limited to
their 1986 production during the 12 months starting next July 1,
assuming the treaty takes effect Jan. 1. They will have to make a
20 percent cut in 1993, and an additional 30 percent cut in 1998.
   Eileen Claussen, acting deputy assistant EPA administrator for
air pollution, said EPA was not sure it had authority for either an
auction or a fee. The agency concedes a fee might be considered a
tax that Congress would have to enact.
   ``If (an auction) was judged to be illegal, we would have
nothing. We wouldn't be in compliance with the Montreal protocol,''
she said.
   Also, she said, ``There is a concern about hoarding,'' with big
companies like automakers able to outbid the thousands of small
companies that use CFCs.
   Dawson said OMB believed EPA had authority to conduct an
auction. Neither agency disputes that in theory, an auction should
capture all the windfall for the government because producers will
bid for production rights up to the point where production doesn't
meet their profit goals.
   John Hoffman, project officer for the new regulations, said
``our concern is the incentive producers might have for keeping an
existing product in production,'' delaying the switch to harmless
alternatives.
   ``While higher prices for CFCs and halons will stimulate some
firms and industries to shift to alternate materials, institute or
increase recycling, or produce other products, if substitutes are
not readily available, many firms will have little choice but to
continue to use these chemicals while paying a higher price,''
EPA's notice said.
   The five U.S. manufacturers of CFCs are: Du Pont Co.;
Allied-Signal Corp.; Pennwalt Corp.; Kaiser Chemicals Co.; and
Racon Inc.
   Ten other companies import the compounds.
   The Du Pont Co. does not believe there will be a windfall
because substitute compounds are being developed quickly, said Joe
Steed, environmental manager for CFCs.
   ``If we can fund development at the rate we think we need, we'll
be doing well,'' Steed said. Du Pont says it will end all CFC
production about the year 2000.
   David Doniger, senior attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group, said he would challenge
the regulations in court.
   Halting ozone depletion ``requires a virtually complete ban on
CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals. Even then, recovery of
the ozone layer will take at least a century,'' Doniger said.

   Children as young as 3 years old have been
sexually abused by therapists, according to a survey by an American
Psychological Association committee.
   Kenneth S. Pope, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles and
chairman of the American Psychological Association's ethics
committee, said Monday that the committee's recent survey of what
he called ``distinguished psychologists'' nationwide disclosed 82
instances of sexual intimacy between therapists and minor patients.
   ``From the 90 who replied to the survey, 24 percent said they
knew of instances where therapists abused minor patients,'' he
said. ``Five percent said they knew of hearsay accounts.''
   Of the 82 cases reported, he said, 56 percent of the victims
were female and the rest were male.
   The ages of the male victims ranged from 7 to 16, with a mean
age of 12.5, he said. Among female victims, the ages ranged from 3
to 17, with a mean age of 13.75.
   Pope said the survey results will be published next year.
   The survey is the latest attempt by the mental health profession
to examine itself and to purge its ranks of therapists who take
advantage of their position to have sexual relations with patients.
   A report published in the July issue of American Psychologist
said studies have shown ``therapist-patient sexual intimacy to be a
major problem for all major mental health professions'' despite the
threat of multimillion-dollar malpractice suits, censure by the
profession and, in some states, new laws that make such practices a
felony.
   ``This practice (sexual intimacy with patients) causes deep and
lasting harm both to the clients and to the integrity of the
profession,'' said the report in the association journal. ``The
scope of the problem is extensive.''
   In a telephone interview, Pope said studies indicate that an
average of one of every 10 male therapists has been involved in at
least one incident of intimacy with a patient. He said a 1983
California study showed that of those therapists sexually intimate
with patients, 80 percent are involved with more than one patient,
indicating a pattern of exploitation.
   Among female therapists, he said, the incidence of patient abuse
is far less _ about 1 percent to 3 percent.
   It is not known how common such sexual exploitation is in other
professions, said Pope, because no other professional group has
made such an effort to study and correct the problem. But he said
the APA has expanded its study to include the campuses and clinics
where students are trained to become mental health workers and
found that sexual abuse apparently is even more common there than
in the patient-client arena.
   He said anonymous surveys show 13 percent of psychology
professors or clinical supervisors questioned admit to sexual
intimacies with psychology students. Most of the victims are
female, he said. One study showed that 25 percent of the women who
have received doctorate of psychology degrees in the last six years
admit to sleeping with their professors.
   Pope said therapy patients are particularly vulnerable to sexual
advances because during the course of treatment they often come to
believe they are in love with their therapists.
   ``It is very frequently a normal part of therapy,'' he said.
``But therapists are supposed to be trained to resist, no matter
how seductive the patient becomes.''
   He said sex with patients ``is always prohibited, it is always
unethical and there is no instance in which this is appropriate
therapy. It is always the responsibility of the therapist to assure
that there is no sexual act.''
   Pope added that ``the clients are always the victims. It cannot
be a mutually consenting activity.''
   Most courts now agree with this position, he said. In the past
10 years, 45 percent of all malpractice awards through the APA's
professional liability coverage have dealt with patient-therapist
intimacy. One case alone involved a damage award of $2.3 million.
   Three states _ Colorado, Wisconsin and Minnesota _ have made it
a felony for therapists to engage in sex with clients or even
former clients. The maximum penalties include 20-year prison terms
and $20,000 in fines.
   ``Consent of the client is not a defense,'' American
Psychologist notes.
   Pope said the psychology profession is ``doing a terrible job''
in policing itself.
   ``The field needs to do a better job in selection, in training,
in identification of therapists who are impaired or who are
sexually exploitive,'' he said. ``If the field doesn't do that,
then the licensing boards and the courts need to step in.''

<HEAD>US Rejects Revised Soviet Proposal on Disputed Radar Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A revised Soviet proposal to make a disputed
Siberian radar station inoperable met with swift U.S. rejection,
leaving the future of Krasnoyarsk and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty cloudy.
   Soviet negotiator Vladimir Kuznetsov presented the proposal to
make the equipment at Krasnoyarsk inoperable to Henry Cooper, his
U.S. counterpart, who rejected it outright, a U.S. official said
Monday.
   The exchange took place during arms control talks in Geneva,
Switzerland, last month, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   This was the second Soviet attempt to settle the dispute over
Krasnoyarsk, which President Reagan and even some of his American
critics say is in violation of the 1972 treaty's constraints on
defenses against missiles.
   A few days earlier, Viktor P. Karpov, the Soviet foreign
ministry's top arms control specialist, had offered to dismantle
the facility if the two governments resolved their differences over
the treaty.
   The White House and State Department publicly rejected the
offer. ``The Soviets should comply with their ABM treaty
obligations by dismantling the radar without delay and without
conditions,'' Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said.
``I am not going to discuss the merits of conditions.''
   Kuznetsov, subsequently clarifying the proposal to Cooper, said
the Soviets were not prepared to level Krasnoyarask but only to
make the equipment inoperable, the U.S. official told The
Associated Press.
   Cooper was described as vigorous in rejecting the Soviet
proposition.
   The 1972 treaty, considered a landmark in the arms control
process, restricts U.S. and Soviet defenses on the theory that a
potential aggressor would be less inclined to launch a nuclear
attack if the retaliation were apt to be devastating.
   Reagan is in the process of deciding whether the Krasnoyarsk
radar is a ``material breach'' of the accord. That, in turn, could
clear the way for the United States to go beyond the treaty in the
U.S. anti-missile program known popularly as ``Star Wars.''
   The president's advisers are split. Some have suggested he take
the legal step, while others have recommended further diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Krasnoyarsk dispute.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction to the highest level in nine
months.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $6.8 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.89 percent, up
from 6.88 percent last week. Another $6.8 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.15 percent, up
from 7.09 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 6.96
percent on Oct. 13 and six-month bills averaged 7.21 percent on
Oct. 19.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.11 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,825.80 and 7.52 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,638.50.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.85
percent last week from 7.79 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   City Council members voted Monday night to
defy a federal judge who is threatening to bankrupt the city and
send them to jail unless they endorse a housing desegregation plan.
   The 4-3 vote came at a raucous special meeting in which speakers
were interrupted, cheered and booed. The majority voted not to
endorse a court-ordered plan providing for financial and zoning
incentives to attract developers to build 800 units of affordable
housing throughout the city.
   U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Sand has said that if the
council failed to pass the resolution by Monday, he would would
fine Yonkers $100 for the first day, and would double the fine for
each day thereafter. After 22 days, the fines would wipe out the
city's annual operating budget of $337 million.
   In addition, Sand has threatened to fine each council member
$500 a day. If they remained in contempt after 10 days, they would
be jailed, Sand said.
   After the vote, Mayor Nicholas Wasiscko said he might call
another special council meeting later this week, and hoped
meanwhile that the judge would see ``some good faith'' in the
closeness of the vote and would delay the fines.
   ``The rule of law has got to be respected,'' said Wasiscko, 29,
who won election as an opponent of desegregation but has since come
to support the court-ordered plan.
   ``Mob rule, whether it is on a street corner or in a city
council chamber, should never be the rule of the day,'' he said.
   One person was arrested for disorderly conduct outside the
meeting, where about 300 people congregated on the street, which
was closed off.
   During the meeting, Vice Mayor Henry Spallone, the most
vociferous opponent of the desegregation plan, rallied the crowd of
about 150 by blasting the federal government and the way it runs
public housing.
   ``The people of Yonkers are not guilty of anything. The people
guilty here (are) the federal government, the state, the MHA
(Municipal Housing Authority) and their lies,'' Spallone said.
   Spallone also charged that Sand felt himself to be above the
law. The vice mayor also claimed that any vote was illegal because
he was coerced into voting before a public hearing was held.
   Another member who voted against the plan, Council Minority
Leader Nicholas Longo, said there should have been a public meeting
before Monday night's vote.
   Noting that Sand lives in an exclusive suburb, Longo said,
``This is a typical case of the hypocrisy of the rich and elitist
looking down upon those who must work for everything they have.''
   Monday night's meeting was the latest installment in an
acrimonious dispute that began in 1980 when the Justice Department
charged that Yonkers had intentionally segregated its housing and
schools for 40 years.
   Yonkers, with 195,000 residents, is the state's fourth-largest
city. By virtue of its location, it also is a town with a split
personality.
   The east side is predominately white, middle to upper class, the
home of Sarah Lawrence College; it borders the wealthy towns of
Scarsdale and Bronxville. The west side is older, more industrial,
and mostly black and Hispanic; it adjoins New York City's poorest
borough, the Bronx.
   In 1985, Sand found Yonkers guilty in a landmark decision that
linked school segregation to housing segregation for the first time.
   The city's Board of Education launched its integration plan in
1986. That same year, Sand ordered the city to construct 200 units
of low-income housing on the east side and 800 more units of
housing throughout the city _ 160 low-income homes and the rest for
moderate incomes.
   When they campaigned last fall, six of the seven council members
pledged to fight the Sand plan. But in January, under threat of
fines, the council agreed to a consent decree that would allow
construction to go forward.
   The public recoiled. Residents mobbed council meetings,
screaming for hours on end. Council members received bullets in the
mail. Picket lines formed in front of the judge's homes in
Manhattan and Pound Ridge.
   The council flip-flopped, and sought to appeal the plan. The
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal, but the council
persisted in its opposition.
   The threat of fines has special resonance in Yonkers, which
required a state bailout to avoid bankruptcy in 1984 and has
struggled to regain its financial footing. The city has seen three
years of budget surpluses as well as a growing tax base.
   Susan Brewster, executive director of the Emergency Financial
Control Board established to monitor Yonkers spending, said if the
city was found in contempt of court, Moody's Investment Co. would
suspend the city's BAA bond rating. Such a move would jeopardize
the city's financial future, she said.

<HEAD>Cypriot President Appeals For Removal Of Turkish Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cypriot President George Vassiliou said
President Reagan accepted his proposal of persuading Turkey to
withdraw its troops and Turkish settlers from his divided island,
but a White House spokesman disputed that.
   Vassiliou, in an interview after the 30-minute White House
meeting Monday, said Reagan ``was favorably accepting those
principles.''
   Cyprus has been divided since a Turkish invasion 14 years ago.
Vassiliou proposed the demilitarization of the Mediterranean
country and the creation of a federalized republic.
   ``I said it would be beneficial to Cypriots, Turks and Greeks,
and act as a stabilizing role in the region,'' he said.
   ``I said Cyprus should be Cypriot,'' Vassiliou said of his
conversation with Reagan. ``The solution of the Cyprus problem is
very simple. It depends on the implementation of principles the
United States believes in. That means no foreign troops should be
in the country and human rights should be implemented.''
   However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan did
not take a position on the Turkish-Cypriot problem, but merely had
endorsed using the United Nations' auspices to negotiate a
settlement to the longstanding dispute.
   Fitzwater said Reagan only generally favors withdrawal of
foreign troops, and there was no statement made about the Turkish
troops.
   ``The president has taken that position around the world, in
country after country,'' Fitzwater said. ``But what we said in
there (the meeting with Vassiliou) was that the proper place to
resolve it was the U.N.''
   Vassiliou has talks scheduled Aug. 24 in New York under United
Nations auspices with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Dentash.
   Greece and Turkey have stepped to the brink of war in recent
years because of long-standing differences over Cyprus and
oil-prospecting rights in the Aegean Sea.
   Turkey invaded and seized the northern part of the island in
July 1974, saying it was protecting the Tyrkish Cypriot minority in
the wake of a Greek-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
   The 120,000-strong Turkish Cypriot community, forming 17 percent
of the island's population, established a breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied area in November 1983. Only Turkey has recognized
it.
   The reunification of the island is blocked by Turkey's refusal
to implement a series of U.N. General Assembly and Security Council
resolutions.
   These demand the withdrawal of the estimated 30,000 Turkish
troops and 50,000 mainland settlers brought to northern Cyprus
since the invasion, the abrogation of the breakaway move and the
return of 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, one-third of the
population, to their homes in the north.

<HEAD>Barge Operators: Great Lakes Diversion Merits More Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The barge-shipping industry group _ which says
drought may cost the industry up to $200 million _ wants the Army
Corps of Engineers to re-examine a proposal to divert Great Lakes
water to the Mississippi River if the drought reduces river levels
further.
   ``We're not disagreeing with the corps on whether it's needed or
not,'' said Joseph Farrell, president of The American Waterways
Operators. ``But if the diversion proves to be necessary, they say
it won't have any effect.
   ``The industry thinks them wrong.''
   Inland barge and towboat operators already have lost $45 million
to $60 million since June 15 because of the drought, Farrell said
at a news conference Monday. He predicted they would lose $150
million to $200 million _ 20 percent of their annual revenue _ even
if conditions do not worsen.
   Although some smaller barge operators could be forced out of
business because of losses, Farrell said he knew of none which have
folded so far and is unaware of layoffs.
   He also said executives of major shipping firms unanimously
agreed after reviewing loss projections that they would not seek
government relief in the form of grants, loans or a fuel tax
exemption.
   ``The industry feels that this is one of the risks of
business,'' he said.
   Unprecedented low-water levels are making it impossible to move
t oload them as heavily, and Farrell
said shorter, lighter tows are taking twice the usual time to reach
their destinations.
   ``The effect is on the bottom line,'' he said. ``Time is always
money.''
   For example, he said it now takes 28 to 30 days to make what
customarily is a two-week trip pushing grain barges from processing
plants in Minneapolis to New Orleans for shipment overseas.
   The lower Mississippi, downriver from the confluence of the
Missouri and the Ohio, is experiencing the worst problems because
it has no lock-and-dam system to hold back water and maintain
higher levels, he said.
   ``The Ohio has got locks and dams up and down its length.
Because of that, the ability to regulate the flow has made that not
a critical problem,'' Farrell said. ``It's the same with the
Missouri.''
   The Mississippi at New Orleans currently is flowing at a rate of
90,000 cubic feet per second, down from the normal rate of 500,000
cubic feet, and the Corps of Engineers does not expect the flow to
drop further, Farrell said.
   Assistant Secretary of the Army Robert Page recently denied a
request to increase diversion of Great Lakes water through the
Illinois River to the Mississippi, saying the greater flow would
raise the level on the river at St. Louis only six inches to a foot
_ not enough to benefit shipping.
   ``We think six inches to a foot at St. Louis would be a big
help,'' Farrell said. ``We just don't think it's needed yet. But
when the time comes, if sacrificing an inch on the Great Lakes for
six inches to a foot can save the Mississippi system, I think it
will be accepted by everybody.''

   A referendum on casino gambling in Detroit and a GOP Senate
contest between two millionaires highlight Michigan's ballot today,
while Missouri voters decide whether to raise their lottery jackpot
and make a former first lady the Democratic candidate for governor.
   Missouri Democrats a~so are expected to nominate Rep. Richard
Gephardt for a seventh term and give farm activist Wayne Cryts a
second shot at Congress.
   Kansas also has primaries, but there are no statewide races and
only three congressional contests. In the 3rd District, GOP
incumbent Jan Meyers faces Charles B. ``Bat'' Masterson, 73, a
retired school administrator.
   The Detroit advisory referendx
opponents of gambling, who want to discourage the Legislature from
legalizing casinos. Similar referendums showed voters opposed tom
gambling in 1976 and 1982.
   Mayor Coleman Young believes casinos can bring desperately
needed money into the city and help lower the 9.6 percent
unemployment rate, a position that has pitted him against the
ministers and church members who have formed the core of his
constituency. All over the city on Sunday preachers used their
pulpits to make one last anti-casino pitch.
   Michigan's hottest statewide race is for the GOP nomination to
challenge Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle, who has no primary
opposition as he seeks a third term.
   Robert Huber and Jim Dunn, each of whom served one term in
Congress, have tried to portray Riegle as too liberal for Michigan
voters. They have had trouble attracting contributions and both
have spent more than $200,000 of their own money, while Riegle has
campaign funds of $4 million.
   Huber, the more conservative of the two, has sought to win
support from the partisans brought into the party by the Rev. Pat
Robertson's presidential campaign, and has prominently mentioned
his anti-abortion stand in ads.
   AIDS became an issue in the race last week when Dunn said in a
radio interview that he took ``a reasonable, rational, I think very
responsible approach to the problems that face this nation. Mr.
Huber has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath of
God, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users.
   Huber, asked about Dunn's remarks, said ``I don't know whether
it's the wrath of God, but if it isn't it should be.''
   In Missouri, state Rep. Betty Hearnes, who calls herself a
compassionate friend of working Missourians, is considered the
Democrats' best bet for unseating Republican Gov. John Ashcroft.
   She's expected to face little trouble with her only primary
opposition, Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis area teacher who is
making his second bid for governor.
   Mrs. Hearnes, 61, is the wife of Warren Hearnes, who was
governor from 1965-73. If elected, she would be Missouri's first
woman governor.
   Gephardt, who filed at the last minute for a seventh term after
dropping his presidential bid, faces three little-known Democrats
in the St. Louis-area 3rd District.
   Cryts, who gained national publicity in 1981 when he took his
family's soybeans out of a bankrupt, padlocked grain elevator, is
favored to win the Democratic nomination for the 8th District
congressional seat. That would entitle him to a rematch with
Republican Rep. Bill Emerson, who won by 8,000 out of 150,000 votes
cast in 1986.
   A statewide measure asks voters to remove most spending
restrictions on the 2{-year-old lottery, a change supporters call
crucial in light of a $24 million drop in sales during the last
fiscal year. Officials say the decline was probably caused by a
lack of advertising.
   Currently, 45 percent of lottery proceeds must go for prizes, 45
percent to the state and 10 percent for administrative costs,
including advertising.
   Critics say the prize limit does not allow the lottery to
compete with neighboring states with higher prize structures. The
amendment would change the prize limit to a minimum of 45 percent,
and lottery officials would like to give out about 50 percent in
prizes. It also would permit the state to spend more on advertising.

   Martin Scorsese's film ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' will appear in the Venice Film Festival, despite being
branded by some church leaders as blasphemous and condemned by
Italy's leading political party.
   ``Why not show it?'' asked Genny Fiorin, head of the Cinema
Office, in a telephone interview Monday from Venice.
   The Christian Democrats denounced the movie in which Jesus must
endure the ``last temptation'' _ making love to Mary Magdalene.
   The Italian Roman Catholic organization Reagire (React) also
sent the festival's director a telegram criticizing the film as
blasphemous. The festival begins Aug. 28.
   Fundamentalist church groups also have protested the movie in
the United States. The movie, which stars Willem Dafoe as Jesus and
Barbara Hershey as Mary, is to be released next month.

   ``La Bamba'' star Lou Diamond Phillips says
he's a shoo-in for most ethnic roles, thanks to his multiracial
heritage _ mostly Filipino with a little Chinese, Hawaiian and
Spanish mixed in.
   ``There are a lot of blond-haired, blue-eyed actors out there,
and good ones at that,'' Phillips said recently. ``But in my
category there aren't that many actors in the running.''
   Phillips made his film debut portraying Ritchie Valens in last
summer's hit ``La Bamba.'' Now he's joining other young Hollywood
actors in ``Young Guns.''
   The Billy the Kid movie starring Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen,
Kiefer Sutherland and Phillips will be released Aug. 12. Phillips
stars as Jose Chavez y Chavez of Mexican and Navajo Indian heritage.

   Police from four states have canceled
plans to protest at a performance by Willie Nelson after the
country singer decided to give a concert that will partially
benefit law enforcement officers.
   ``If everything goes as planned, we probably won't have any
demonstration,'' said Al Leavitt, president of the state Fraternal
Order of Police, of Nelson's concert scheduled for Aug. 27.
   Police nationwide criticized his appearance last October at a
benefit for Leonard Peltier, an American Indian activist serving
two life sentences for the 1975 slayings of two FBI agents.
   Peltier's supporters are raising money to pay for an appeal.
   The West Virginia FOP made plans to protest at Nelson's Aug. 27
concert in Charleston after Rhode Island police said they would
picket the singer concerts last weekend in Warwick, R.I.
   About 800 officers from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Virginia demonstrated at a Nelson concert Friday in Warwick, R.I.,
but canceled plans for a demonstration Saturday after Nelson agreed
to the new benefit concert.
   Proceeds will go to the American Indian Relief Fund and the
National Police Memorial Fund.

Reagan to be a member of the National Council on the Arts.
   Hamlisch has written numerous scores for movies and Broadway
musicals, including ``They're Playing our Song'' and ``Chorus
Line,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award. He often is
host of a broadcast concert series presented at the White House and
is a favorite of Nancy Reagan's.
   If Monday's nomination is confirmed by the Senate, Hamlisch

<HEAD>US Plays Down Significance of Iranian Message</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration says it received a
private message from Iran, but it didn't include anything that Iran
hasn't been saying publicly about improving relations, and the
United States has not responded to it.
   ``The thrust of it was that they said the same thing in private
that they've been saying in public _ that any improvement in
relations would require some kind of action'' to prove U.S.
interest in improved relations, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Monday.
   Neither Fitzwater nor State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley would dwell on the contents of the message. Fitzwater said
it did address the issue of the return of Iranian assets, estimated
to be worth more than $1 billion, that the United States froze in
the wake of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Fitzwater said the message indicated the United States would be
expected to move on the assets issue or ``some other quid pro quo
kind of movement, which we are not prepared to do.''
   Last week, Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's parliament
and acting commander-in-chief of Iranian armed forces, said he
would help obtain the release of American hostages in Lebanon if
the United States returned the assets.
   ``No deals,'' Fitzwater retorted at the time, reflecting
repeated official U.S. statements that there would be no
negotiations with Iranian officials for the release of nine
Americans believed held hostage in Lebanon by people sympathetic to
the revolutionary government of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Fitzwater repeated that stand Monday, saying: ``We have always
said that the best signal they can give to new relations and new
dialogue is to release the hostages. But we don't make the direct
linkage. In fact, we just simply state they should release the
hostages.''
   At the State Department, Mrs. Oakley said the Iranian message
came late Friday through a ``third party.''
   ``We simply said that we had sent a message. We had a
response.'' Asked whether the United States had replied to Iran,
she said: ``No.''
   The Reagan administration had written a letter to Iran
congratulating the government for accepting U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598, seeking a cease-fire to the Iran-Iraq war and
expressing an interest in an improvement of relations.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Sunday that he is
willing to meet with his Iranian counterpart to discuss an end to
the Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking _ but not the
return of Iranian assets.
   U.S. officials are trying to find ``an authoritative channel''
for direct talks with Iran, but Shultz said he has not sought a
meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati during the
Iranian official's visit to the United Nations for peace talks.
   The frozen Iranian assets include military equipment and some
funds in American bank accounts.
   Many of the assets were released in January 1981, as Iran freed
the Americans embassy hostages after a 444-day ordeal. A special
tribunal in The Hague, which arbitrated claims by the two
governments, has jurisdiction over the assets that remain frozen.
Iran has petitioned that tribunal for return of those assets.

   ``Cocktail,'' starring Tom Cruise as an
acrobatic bartender who gets shaken and stirred by romance, was
moviegoers' choice last weekend as it earned $11.7 million at the
nation's box offices.
   Besides ``Cocktail,'' Walt Disney had two other films in the top

   An unspecified mechanical

International Airport said.
   The Challenger jet was on a flight to Kelowna from Nanaimo,
British Columbia, when it landed about 6 p.m. PDT. The plane took
off for Kelowna again about an hour later, officials said.
   Earlier Monday, Mulroney ignored heckles and jeers from
anti-abortion demonstrators and opponents of a free-trade pact with
the United States during Vancouver Island stops in Comox and
Nanaimo.
   Mulroney wraps up a four-day visit to Alberta and British

   A tour bus carrying 34 children and seven
adults veered off a road and down an embankment on the outskirts of
the state capital Monday, killing the driver, leaving four people
hospitalized and dozens of others with minor injuries, authorities
said.
   Authorities said they were investigating the possibility that
the driver, Dominic Boudreau, 42, of Biddeford, suffered some kind
of an attack that led to the crash. An autopsy report was scheduled
to be released Tuesday.
   The Maine Line Tours bus was taking 12- and 13-year-old boys and
their chaperones from Camp Cedar, a private, overnight camp on
Sebago Lake in western Maine, on a camping and fishing trip to Bar
Harbor when the accident occurred at 11:20 a.m., said Henry Hacker,
a camp director.
   Twenty-nine passengers were taken to the Kennebec Valley Medical
Center in Augusta for treatment, hospital spokeswoman Mary Plumer
said. Eight were taken to the nearby Togus Veterans Administration
Hospital, while others were sent for treatment to Waterville.
   A counselor and three children were hospitalized, two of them in
intensive care with broken bones, Plumer said Monday night. The
rest were sent back to Camp Cedar, said Hacker, who described their
injuries as minor.
   Witnesses said the 49-seat bus veered off Route 3, about seven
miles outside downtown Augusta. The bus traveled down an embankment
and rolled onto its side before coming to rest in a stand of trees.
   ``Eyewitnesses said it was going down the (road) and just (went)
right off the road into the trees, kabang. ... Fortunately it
wasn't any worse,'' said Albert L. Godfrey Sr. of the Maine Highway
Safety Commission, who was at the scene.
   Other witnesses said the accident looked much worse at first.
   ``The kids were laying all along here with the blood, they were
a mess,'' said Frances Cunningham, who lives near the scene of the
accident.
   ``They were all so scared, and they wanted their parents,'' said
another resident from nearby, Connie Boggs.

<HEAD>Students Plan First School Dance In Wake Of Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PURDY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students in this tiny Ozarks town are getting
ready for their first school dance now that a federal judge has
ruled that a century-old ban on such festivities is
unconstitutional.
   ``I want to get right on the stick and get it rolling,'' said
16-year-old Nancy Fox, president of the Purdy senior and junior
high school council. ``I think most of the kids are excited.''
   ``It's wonderful,'' added Jonathan Clayton, who graduated from
Purdy High School in May. ``It's my dream come true.''
   Clayton and Miss Fox's parents were among 21 plaintiffs who sued
the school board in 1986, claiming that the ban was inspired by
religious beliefs. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark
agreed but didn't order the school to sponsor dances.
   Clark, whose court is in Springfield, said the rule in effect
promoted the religious beliefs of those in Purdy ``who believe that
social dancing is sinful.''
   School board attorney Ransom Ellis Jr. said that conclusion was
incorrect, although no decision has been made about an appeal.
   School board members cited other reasons for the ban, including
potential discipline and drinking problems.
   The board, whose district has 520 students, including about 250
in the junior-senior high school, could still seek to ban dancing
for other reasons, said William Fleischaker, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer who helped represent the plaintiffs. ``But
in my opinion that would be a foolish step.''
   Although dances were banned on school property, they have been
held at a town community center, and students have organized
junior-senior proms and held them in neighboring communities.
   The controversy escalated after the Class of 1986 failed to
persuade the school board to drop the ban, and dance supporters
held a rally like the one in the movie, ``Footloose,'' about a
fictional Texas town where dancing was banned.
   Miss Fox said her executive council and its adviser will meet
soon to plan a dance, which she said might be a back-to-school
celebration.
   ``We'll draw up a proposal to bring before the administration
... just like we would any other activity,'' Miss Fox said.
   Most students are happy the ban has been ruled unconstitutional,
she said.
   ``There may still be students who don't want to dance because of
their religious beliefs. But those who dance and want to dance, we
will have dances for them if all goes well.''
   Clark conducted a four-day hearing for the lawsuit in June. In
his order, he granted the plaintiffs' request for a symbolic $1
plus attorney fees.
   Church leaders in this southwestern Missouri town of about 900
people made no secret of their opposition to the school dances and
openly lobbied board members. At a spring school board election,
anti-dancing members were overwhelmingly re-elected.

   A 71-year-old man who swam around Manhattan now
plans to swim across the English Channel and around Catalina Island
off California in memory of a son he lost in an automobile accident.
   ``Every time I swim, it's a tribute to Richard,'' Ashby Harper
said. Harper has dedicated all his marathon swimming efforts to his
son since 1981, the year he died.
   ``I'm doing something that has ruined men half my age,'' said
the prep school headmaster from Albuquerque, N.M., of the three
swims before completing Sunday's 28.5-mile trip around Manhattan in
8 hours 34 minutes.
   He said the Channel swim on Aug. 21 and the excursion around
Catalina Island on Sept. 12 will be more difficult.
   Harper became the oldest person to cross the 21-mile Channel in
1983. He had held the record for the oldest person to swim around
Manhattan until his record was broken in 1984 by 73-year-old Adrian
Kanaar.

   The city announced plans Monday to stop putting
homeless families into hotels within two years, speeding up a
previous five-year commitment.
   The announcement by Mayor Edward I. Koch came during a
congressional hearing to determine whether the city was living up
to a promise to end the use of welfare hotels in exchange for
Congress' continued funding for the hotels.
   Congress is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to extend the
program another year.
   Some political leaders present at the hearing, including Rep.
Bill Green, R-N.Y., said the proposal might be an effective
political move but also might become an unkept promise.
   William J. Grinker, commissioner of the city's Human Resources
Administration, told the panel the ``problem will not be solved, we
will still have homelessness.''
   Under a plan developed earlier this year, the city said it would
stop using the hotels by the end of fiscal year 1993. It was
projected that 1,179 families would still be in hotels and 3,906
families would be in city operated transitional shelters by the end
of fiscal year 1990.
   Under the plan announced Monday, by the end of 1989, some 1991
families would be in hotels and 2,256 families in the transitional
shelters. By the end of 1990, no families are expected to be in
hotels and 3,534 would be in the shelters.
   One of the plan's key components, Koch told the panel, is that
``we will be providing 2,300 more Housing Authority and HPD
(Department of Housing, Preservation and Development) apartments to
homeless families over the next two years than we had anticipated
under the original plan.''
   Koch noted that Congress had changed its regulations recently,
allowing the city to give homeless families priority over families
on waiting lists.
   He said the plan would work only if a sufficient number of large
apartments and shelter units become available, and families
continue to enter and leave the hotel system at the same rate they
are doing so now _ and find apartments on their own.

   Hinckley, who shot and wounded President Reagan and three others

he was acquitted of criminal charges by reason of insanity.
   Last year, the government successfully opposed an attempt by

   Motorists who don't like driving around

this year by the General Assembly and took effect July 15. The move
was in response to complaints by gambling opponents and those who
equate the twin spires of the home of the Kentucky Derby with a
state promotion of a private industry.
   Churchill Downs President Thomas H. Meeker said the Louisville
track had not pushed to have the spires put on the plate initially.
   ``I can see a situation where there may be people who for moral
reasons don't particularly appreciate Churchill Downs, and I
respect their feelings on that,'' Meeker said.
   But he was less sympathetic of the private industry argument
because of the part Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby play in
the state economy.

<HEAD>Firefighters' Union Endorses Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the annual convention of
the International Association of Fire Fighters voted overwhelmingly
to endorse Democrat Michael Dukakis in this year's presidential
election.
   The 1,200 delegates to the 170,000-member union passed a
resolution Monday saying the Massachusetts governor had done more
for firefighters than the Reagan administration, spokesman Henry
Fleischer said.
   The resolution said ``firefighters cannot be burdened for
another four years with a president who is indifferent to the needs
and concerns of firefighters,'' Fleischer said.
   The IAFF statement said that as governor of Massachusetts,
Dukakis has shown that he ``understands firefighters' issues and
has demonstrated his support in Massachusetts by signing into law
several petitions that benefit fire fighters and their families.''

<HEAD>Glenn Presidential Committee Agrees to $30,000 Penalty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has closed the books on a case
involving the 1984 presidential campaign committee of Sen. John
Glenn, with the committee agreeing to pay a $30,000 civil penalty
for alleged violations of federal election law.
   The Federal Election Commission said Monday it had found
probable cause to believe that the Glenn committee and its
treasurer, William R. White, accepted excessive campaign
contributions, misreported cash and spending levels, and exceeded
spending limits in the 1984 presidential campaign.
   The information was made public in a voluntary ``conciliation
agreement'' between the agency and the campaign committee that was
released by the FEC. The agreement requires that the committee pay
a $30,000 civil penalty for the alleged violations.
   ``This is something we've negotiated out with the commission
over the last few months,'' said White. ``I guess both sides felt
that this was the best way to dispose of the matter.''

<HEAD>Bush Boosting Campbell With Running Mate Suggestions, Some Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is floating Gov. Carroll
Campbell's name as a potential running mate, but some political
leaders in South Carolina say its being done out of respect more
than a serious desire to see Campbell as vice president.
   Republicans and Democrats interviewed Monday said they believe
Bush is trying to boost his chances in the south and that former
Campbell political adviser Lee Atwater _ now Bush's campaign
chairman _ is maneuvering to boost an old friend's national stature.
   ``I see Lee Atwater _ not only his fingerprints but also his
toeprints _ all over this one,'' GOP state Sen. John Courson said.
   Campbell said Friday he is one of several people who have been
asked by the Bush campaign to submit background information.
   Campbell's chief of staff Warren Tompkins acknowledged the
attention extended Campbell's opportunities, but was careful not to
say those opportunities went beyond the Statehouse.
   ``It certainly doesn't hurt his opportunities and the chances
for re-election to a second term,'' Tompkins said.

   Pat Robertson has returned to the
Christian Broadcasting Network as co-host of ``The 700 Club'' after
his unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination.
   ``For better or worse, the health of this ministry depends on
this program. It is our bread and butter,'' the television
evangelist said Monday after the first broadcast of his revamped
program.
   Robertson's return also marked a departure from the previous
incarnation of the program.
   Robertson said the new format will be one-third news, one-third
ministry and teaching and one-third lifestyle features. During the
news section of Monday's program, Robertson and new co-host Sheila
Walsh presented stories about the Middle East, drugs in the
workplace, abortion demonstrations in Atlanta and the first in a
weeklong series on health and nutrition.
   ``We're going to add more people to our Washington bureau. We're
going to be covering more news,'' said Robertson, who has not ruled
out a future bid for the White House.

   Will and Verba Maye Mayo escaped from a
fire with their 11 foster children but their house was destroyed.
Now, volunteers touched by the couple's open-door policy for foster
children are coming to the family's aid.
   They plan to start clearing land for a new house today.
   Mrs. Mayo, the 65-year-old pastor of the Mecis Temple Church of
God, and her husband, a retired coal miner in his 70s, have been
foster parents to about 100 children over the years, including
those who escaped from the burning house in this town about 45
miles northwest of Birmingham.
   ``So many people have been touched by their lives,'' said Joe
Wood, who is helping coordinate plans for a new five-bedroom house
for the Mayos and their foster children.
   Mrs. Mayo and three other adults evacuated the children during
Thursday's fire, but the heat and smoke kept her from going back to
get her purse.
   ``They may catch me without a driver's license but that is all
right,'' Mrs. Mayo said.
   Russell Lyons, a Carbon Hill city council member and retired
carpenter who will take part in the house-raising, said, ``She
deserves anything anybody can do for her.''
   On Monday, friends in this town of 2,500 people opened an
account in the Bank of Carbon Hill with $65 to go toward building
the house.
   But Wood said a church has pledged the help of a dozen men for
two weeks in the building work.
   Wood said the Mayos had some insurance, ``but not near enough.''
   Much labor and materials will be donated, but Wood said, ``if we
get out for $20,000 we'll be doing real good.''
   Unless the house can be put up in a month, the state Department
of Human Resources might be forced to take the children away
because of inadequate conditions of their temporary home in a
nearby house of a relative of Mrs. Mayo.
   ``We're going to do our best to put it up in three weeks,'' said
Wood.
   He said he does not want to see the children _ seven girls and
four boys ranging from age six months to 11 years _ taken from the
Mayos.
   ``Six of those children are in one family and we don't want them
to be separated,'' he said.
   The Mayos, he said, have sent several foster children through
college.
   ``They live a poor life in order to do it but they make
something out of these children,'' Wood said.
   Mrs. Mayo said the children are frightened at the prospect of
leaving.
   She said she cried when one told her, ``Don't worry, we'll get
something else.''
   ``I hate for them to see me cry, but I did when he said that,''
she said. ``The babies don't know what is going on, but the older
ones are scared. They couldn't sleep because they have never been
anywhere else.''
   Johnny Lampley said it is time to repay what his grandmother has
done for him, and the children.
   ``She raised me from a little child,'' he said. ``We all love
her. She is the best mother we could have.''

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Reach Compromise On Woman Bishops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican bishops from throughout the
world agreed overwhelmingly that the thorny issue of consecrating
women as bishops and ordaining them as priests should not splinter
the Anglican Communion.
   They voted Monday night for a carefully worded compromise
resolution that was designed to keep their churches together
despite deep divisions on the issue.
   The bishops, representing 70 million Anglicans in 164 countries,
said the churches must respect one another's decisions and
attitudes and maintain communications with other bishops regardless
of gender or viewpoint.
   The voting by a show of hands was 423-28, with 19 abstentions.
   The U.S. Episcopal Church, a member of the Anglican Communion,
and the Canadian and New Zealand Anglicans are considering
consecrating woman bishops this year. They have admitted more than
1,000 women to the priesthood in the past 11 years.
   The 27 Anglican chuches worldwide are self-governing. They look
to the Lambeth Conference for guidance but the conference, which is
holding its first meeting in Canterbury in 10 years, cannot give
them orders.
   The extent of the bishops' anxiety was shown in a secret ballot.
By 277-187, they defeated a call to the churches to ``refrain from
consecrating a woman as bishop'' because of the damage it would do
to the Anglican Communion.
   The successful compromise was moved by conference participants
who spent most of the first two weeks of the three-week gathering
discussing and drafting it. The conference ends Sunday Aug. 7.
   The defeated resolution was proposed by Archbishop Donald
Robinson of Sydney, Australia, who wants to keep the priesthood and
episcopate all-male and who said he wanted the secret ballot.
   Robinson said a woman bishop was ``contrary to the explicit
teaching of the New Testament'' and threatened a ``fundamental
breach'' of Scripture, faith and order.
   South African Bishop George Swartz of Kimberley and Kuruman
supported him. Swartz said that while the women priests movement
was right to say that many would be hurt if women were not
consecrated bishops, ``many more will be hurt if they are.''
   Margaret Hewitt of England, who attended the conference as a
member of the Anglican Consultative Council, was the only woman to
speak in the debate.
   She opposed women being priests and bishops, saying: ``Not all
the women of the Anglican Communion are convinced that women's
ordination is acceptable, desirable or appropriate ... The Anglican
Communion has seemed for some time to be the Anglican Confusion.''
   But Bishop Edmond L. Browning, presiding bishop of the U.S.
Episcopal Church, said it would be ``only a matter of time before
women are elected bishops'' in his church.
   ``This (Robinson's) resolution misrepresents what women have
learned about ministry and what we have learned from these women.
It ignores the maturity we have achieved and the gifts we have been
given and share,'' he said.
   ``In failing to reflect what we have forgotten and what we have
learned, it invites mischief, rebellion and anarchy. In so doing,
it would foster what it seeks to avoid: it would usher in
disunity.''
   Bishop of London Graham Leonard, the leading opponent of women
priests in the Church of England, said he would vote for the
compromise because it was ``realistic and honest.''
   Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu said he supported women
priests and women bishops but regretted the issue was overshadowing
questions of justice and poverty.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said before the vote that
whichever way the count went, he would take up the compromise
resolution's recommendation to appoint a commission. The commission
will examine relations between Anglican churches and prepare
guidelines for them once a woman is consecrated bishop.
   Runcie is spiritual head of the Church of England and presides
over the conference as the world Anglican leader.
   He warned that even if the conference passed Robinson's
resolution, ``we have no guarantee that all churches will heed it.''

<HEAD>Prime Minister Takeshita Will Not Make Controversial Shrine Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has decided not to
pay an official visit to a shrine dedicated to Japanese war dead on
Aug. 15, the 43rd anniversary of Japan's World War II defeat, a
government spokesman said today.
   Keizo Obuchi, chief Cabinet secretary, told a news conference
Takeshita ``will adopt the same stance as last year,'' when his
predecessor Yasuhiro Nakasone refrained from visiting the Tokyo
shrine for a second straight year.
   Among the 2.4 million Japanese war dead enshrined at Yasukuni
are 14 class-A war criminals, including wartime Prime Minister
Hideki Tojo.
   In 1985, Nakasone visited the shrine in his official capacity as
prime minister to mark the 40th anniversary of the war's end. The
visit was strongly criticized by China, South Korea and other Asian
countries that suffered the effects of Japanese militarism during
the war.
   Last year, the government said Japan must give appropriate
consideration to the national sentiment of its neighbors.
   Yasukuni Shrine was established in 1869 to honor Japan's war
dead. The military used the shrine, which was supported by the
government, to promote patriotism and militarism during the war.
   Government support of the shrine ended in 1945, at the end of
World War II. Japan's Constitution states that no religious
organization shall receive any privileges from the state or
exercise any political authority.

   Inmates complaining of harassment by
officers at a maximum-security prison took five guards hostage
Monday and held them for up to 14 hours before surrendering
peacefully early Tuesday, officials said.
   ``The crisis has ended,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said.
   Four Coxsackie Correctional Facility guards were released at
12:45 a.m. Tuesday, said Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer. One hostage
was taken out on a stretcher and the three others walked out under
their own power, he said.
   Late Monday, guard Warren Agostinoni was released.
   Agostinoni, 28, who was taken by ambulance to a hospital, said
Correction Department spokesman James Flateau. The guard was listed
in fair condition at Albany Medical Center with cuts and bruises,
hospital spokeswoman Peggy Pitcher said.
   The other former hostages also were taken there, with the most
seriously injured identified as David Pratt, 31. Pratt was in
serious condition with abdominal injuires, Pitcher said. The three
others _ Lewis Bloom, 41; Douglas Roberts, 37; and John Shipley, 32
_ were in good condition and were being treated for bruises, she
said.
   Monday evening, the inmates allowed the hostages to stand one at
a time before a window, giving prison officials their first look at
the five guards since they were seized more than nine hours earlier.
   Flateau said the guards looked to be in ``reasonably good
condition'' but that some appeared to have cuts and bruises. He
said the inmates allowed the guards to be seen ``as a show of good
faith, I guess.''
   Earlier, officials said the 32 inmates believed to be involved
were armed with homemade knives. But Flateau said Monday night that
he could not confirm any knives were involved and he said the
complaints with harassment were no longer being talked about.
   Flateau said that as of 11 p.m., the inmates had not given a
list of demands to prison officials. He would not discuss
negotiations other than to say they were ongoing.
   He said the inmates controlled the console that operates their
unit's gates and doors, which lead to other parts of the prison and
a recreation yard.
   Prison Superintendent John Twomey, assisted by a crisis
intervention team, communicated with some of the inmates, Flateau
said.
   ``There have not been demands made at this point as much as
complaints made by the inmates about harassment (by guards),''
Flateau said.
   ``Verbal harassment was the (complaint) they mentioned most
often, food complaints, things like that,'' Flateau said.
   How the takeover occurred was not known, Flateau said.
   The inmates were assigned to the prison's special unit for
prisoners with disciplinary problems, Flateau said.
   State troopers and local police with rifles blocked the entrance
of the prison, which houses 951 prisoners and is about 20 miles
south of Albany.
   All of the prison's roughly 180 guards were called to duty and
about 40 police officers were sent to the prison. All prisoners
were confined to their cells, Flateau said.
   Flateau said the families of the five guards had been contacted
and members of three of those families were at the prison.
   Outside the prison, guard Ralph Scott said inmates had been
warning for weeks that there might be trouble. In the last two
weeks, he said, prisoners' verbal and physical assaults on
corrections officers had increased.
   ``Every so often you hear something might happen, and I had a
feeling something was going to happen,'' Scott said.
   At a news conference in Albany, Cuomo said he did not think the
generally crowded condition of New York state's prisons contributed
to the incident because ``capacity is not a problem'' at Coxsackie.

   Michael Dukakis chided rival George Bush for
refusing to address an Urban League convention and defended his own
running mate's support of Contra aid despite the Democratic
nominee's vocal opposition.
   ``I hope you will note who's here and who isn't here,'' Dukakis
told the Urban League convention Monday night, winning a standing
ovation from the black audience.
   Dukakis returned home late Monday and was spending today and
Wednesday tending to his duties as Massachusetts governor before
resuming campaigning Thursday.
   The applause Dukakis won for the Bush line was the loudest of
his speech, which was greeted cordially but not enthusiastically.
He also won loud applause when he mentioned former Democratic rival
Jesse Jackson, who endorsed Dukakis at the Democratic National
Convention.
   Dukakis praised Jackson's call for ``common ground'' and
promised to march later this month to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights march on
Washington.
   ``Together we can remember the dream,'' Dukakis said.
   Urban League President John E. Jacob said at the opening of the
convention that the organization would have to pressure the next
president on issues such as civil rights and affirmative action.
   Dukakis disputed that.
   If he's elected, Dukakis said, ``next year the pressure is going
to come from the president.''
   There has been increasing pressure on Dukakis in recent weeks to
spell out what he thinks about Bentsen's support of aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels, and the question surfaced again Monday as Senate
Democrats, Bentsen among them, worked to craft a compromise aid
package.
   ``No. No. No,'' Dukakis said whether his running mate's support
for Contra aid bothered him. ``I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen to be a
clone of Michael Dukakis. We agree on most things but we disagree
on some.''
   Still, Dukakis pressed his opposition to Contra aid, a favorite
policy of President Reagan.
   ``It's a failed and an illegal policy and it ought to stop,''
Dukakis told reporters. Referring to the peace plan drafted by
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, he said, ``If we had
enthusiastically supported the Arias plan a year ago this mess
would be over with, the war would be over with.''
   Dukakis' appearance before the Urban League was no accident
began a week in which the candidate is expanding his effort to win
the support of black voters. His campaign is mailing literature
about his affirmative action and judicial appointments record to
nearly 7,000 black elected officials.
   Dukakis told the Urban League ``cramped ideals and the limited
ambitions of the past seven years'' have hurt blacks and other
minorities and said Reagan had engaged in reckless spending that
took money away from more important programs.
   Dukakis criticized the Reagan Justice Department's record on
civil rights and promised to appoint an attorney general ``who will
enforce the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Restoration Act
and the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988.''
   ``We're going to have a president and a vice president who
understand that affirmative action is an essential part of making
the American dream come true for each and every citizen in our
country,'' he said.
   Bush, who will formally accept the GOP nomination in two weeks,
declined to address the Urban League. His campaign said the vice
president had a scheduling conflict.
   Dukakis had both good news and bad news on the home front Monday.
   A preliminary FBI inquiry into allegations the Dukakis
administration acted improperly in placing a prison in central
Massachusetts concluded without charges being filed. Law
enforcement sources said the review found no evidence of any
violations of federal law in the process, which had been challenged
by opponents of the prison plan.
   But his administration had to borrow $200 million to pay its
bills, a sign of a continued slump in state revenue collections.
The state also was forced to borrow money _ through short term
notes _ several times in the fiscal year that ended June 30.

   Share prices closed higher while the dollar
weakened in slow trading in Tokyo Tuesday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which won 126.37 points Monday, gained another
40.02 points, or 0.14 percent, closing at 28,366.33.
   Volume in the first section totaled 800 million shares, down
from Monday's 900 million.
   The dollar opened at 132.65 yen and ranged between 132.30 yen
and 132.70 yen before closing at 132.40 yen, down 0.85 yen from
Monday's close.
   Dollar-sensitive stocks such as electricals and automakers
declined, following the dollar's slip below 133 yen overnight in
New York.
   ``Prices on the stock market were mixed following the upswing of
the yen,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a stock researcher at Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Umemori said some real estate, construction and other issues
less sensitive to the dollar's value rose, but most other sectors
were mixed or weaker.
   Foreign exchange dealers said market participants did not expect
much market-moving news until Friday, when U.S. employment figures
are to be released in Washington.

   Iran said seven rebels were publicly
hanged and their group's attack crushed, but the rebels claimed
they had killed or wounded thousands of Iranian soldiers.
   Some fighting and air strikes were reported Monday along the
Iran-Iraq border while U.N.-mediated peace talks pressed on in New
York.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he would
announce a cease-fire date as soon as a fact-finding team he sent
to the Persian Gulf region returns this week and he consults with
the Security Council.
   The announcement appeared aimed a pressuring Iraq into dropping
its demand that Iran agree to direct talks before a truce takes
effect.
   Ten days of battles sparked by Iraqi offensives followed Iran's
announcement July 18 that it would accept a year-old U.N.
resolution for a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war.
   A U.N. report on chemical weapons released Monday accused Iraq
of using the illegal materials ``on an intensive scale.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the seven
``counter-revolutionaries'' of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's
Holy Warriors, were hanged Monday in Bakhtaran, the provincial
capital of a western region the rebels attacked last week.
   ``Death to the Munafiqeen!'' the crowd chanted, substituting the
Farsi word meaning hypocrite for the one that means holy warrior.
   Official news reports described the seven as the remnants of a
4,800-member Iranian rebel force ``destroyed'' in western Iran last
week.
   Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedeen Khalq, said in a
statement released in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, that the rebel
attack caused ``havoc'' in Iran. He repeated the claim that the
rebels reached 95 miles into western Iran and killed or wounded
40,000 soldiers.
   Neither side's claims could be verified because neutral
observers were not allowed into the area.
   Tehran radio said an Iraqi attack near Mehran, a town in western
Iran, was crushed before dawn Monday and 270 Iraqis were killed.
Iraq did not comment on the claim.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency said helicopter gunships
flew 50 sorties Monday and Iraqi forces killed seven Iranian
soldiers in ground fighting. Iranian dispatches claimed Iraqi
warplanes bombed six Iranian villages, killing ``several domestic
animals.''

   Services were scheduled today in Harvard University's Memorial
Church for Mrs. Mumford, who died Saturday.
   She wrote three collections of poetry _ ``The Door in the
Forest,'' ``Willow Water,'' and ``The Karma Bazaar.''
   Her poems appeared in Ploughshares, Hudson Review, Yankee,
Sequoia and Sojourner. She received prizes from the Poetry Society
of America and Poet Lore and a fellowship from the Massachusetts
Artists Foundation.
   She was born in Geneva, Switzerland, and spent her childhood in
Germany, coming to the United States in 1946. She was graduated
from Radcliffe College in 1957 and received a doctorate in Celtic
languages and literature from Harvard in 1973.
   Mrs. Mumford is survived by her husband, four children and two
brothers.

   Actor Cleavon Little put his money where his
mouth is at a star-studded benefit to support black theater.
   Little, star of Mel Brook's riotous film ``Blazing Saddles,''
and the Broadway play ``I'm not Rappaport,'' drew the winning
raffle tickets Monday night at a midtown Manhattan restaurant, then
pulled out a check for $200.
   ``It's just something important that I think needs to be done,
hopefully to encourage other people,'' said Little. He added that
too often people enjoy themselves at benefits without thinking
about how they can help others.
   ``I was overwhelmed. People just don't pull out checks,'' said
South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, co-author of ``Sarafina!,''
a Broadway play about children in his homeland.
   ``If more people did that, black theater would fly,'' he added.
   The benefit was staged to help the Roger Furman Theater, which
bills itself as the city's oldest black not-for-profit theater.
   The cast of ``Sarafina!,'' which was nominated for five Tonys
this year, performed at the gathering. They were joined by Anna
Maria Horsford, one of the stars of the NBC sit-com, ``Amen'' and
Rosalind Cash, a movie and theater actress with a recurring role on
``The Cosby Show'' spinoff, ``A Different World.''

   A fractured vertebra has forced Elizabeth Taylor
into a hospital for rest and therapy, her physician says.
   The 56-year-old actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in
Santa Monica, Calif., last Thursday. She will require strict bed
rest and physiotherapy, her physician, William Skinner, said in a
brief statement Monday.
   He said X-rays showed a compression fracture of the first lumbar
vertebra had produced lower back muscular spasm that required the
hospitalization.

   A federal lawsuit brought by a girl who
refused to dissect a frog in biology class was dismissed after the
school agreed to let her use photographs of a frog that died of
natural causes.
   Victor Valley Union High School District officials said Jenifer
Graham, 16, can complete the coursework by using the pictures to
identify parts, precluding the need for her to dissect a frog
herself.
   U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real, who proposed the
alternative plan Monday, dismissed Miss Graham's lawsuit against
the school district.
   She contended school officials violated her rights by ordering
her to dissect a frog that was killed for scientific use. Miss
Graham opposes killing animals for science.
   After her refusal to dissect a frog, Miss Graham, a vegetarian,
received a zero for that assignment, lowering her grade from A to
B. Her records also showed that she balked at her teacher's order.
   The girl's lawyers said finding a dead frog in good enough shape
to serve the purpose would be a problem, but they didn't say they
would appeal the ruling.
   ``If we have to station somebody down at the swamps or wherever
it is they live to see them die, we'll do it,'' promised school
attorney Joseph Arias.
   Meanwhile, a new state law, which takes effect Jan. 1, allows
students to be excused from lab dissections if they object on
religious or moral grounds.
   Miss Graham and her lawyers fought to allow her to use models of
a dissected frog. She gained national attention with her fight and
even appeared in a TV commercial for Apple Computers, demonstrating
a computer mock-up of a dead frog that she said would serve the
same purpose as a frog corpse.
   Apple later dropped that commercial because the company said the
animal rights issue was getting more attention than the computer
they advertised.
   The school objected to models, saying they could give Miss
Graham an advantage over other students and could jeopardize the
school's credibility with universities.

   Flash floods triggered by a sudden torrent killed
at least 214 people and left 499 missing in the worst inundation in
eastern China's Zhejiang province in 40 years, a provincial
official said today.
   The Foreign Affairs Department official, who identified himself
only as Huang, said most of the damage hit five counties of the
thriving commercial city of Ningbo on the East China Sea coast.
   Huang said up to 20 inches of rain fell in the area in a ``short
time'' Friday evening. The storm continued through Saturday morning.
   The official China Daily today quoted an unidentified official
of the provincial Flooding and Drought Combating Department as
saying those missing in the sudden squall were ``not likely to
survive.''
   The official said the storm destroyed 16,949 homes, 100
reservoirs and 305 bridges. He put the economic losses at $167
million.
   He said communication, power and water supplies were cut off in
the hard-hit areas of Zhejiang until Sunday.
   Huang said helicopters had been used to rescue some people
stranded by the floods. He said the floodwaters covered 154,400
acres of farmland. About half the waters have receded, he said.
   The storm was the second to pound Zhejiang, one of China's most
prosperous provinces, this year, following torrential rains in late
June that killed 45 people.
   At least 750 people have been reported killed in floods ravaging
coastal, southern and northern China this year, while wide areas of
central China are suffering from severe droughts.
   Floods are a perpetual threat to areas along the Yangtze River
basin and storm-prone coastal regions.
   About 3,000 people died in Sichuan province in Yangtze River
flooding in 1981, 430 were killed by flooding in coastal Shandong
province in 1982 and 400 perished in floods in northeastern China's
Liaoning province in 1985.

<HEAD>Paraplegic Dangles in Wheelchair from Brooklyn Bridge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 years after Stephen Brodie
supposedly took his famous dive off the Brooklyn Bridge and lived
to brag about it, a paraplegic dangled off the span in a wheelchair
for a shot at the record books.
   Ramond Masa, 40, carrying fireworks and samurai swords, lowered
himself on a rope Monday morning from the middle of the bridge and
dangled 75 feet above the East River for more than an hour.
   Police finally persuaded him to lower himself further so he
could be guided on to a police launch.
   The Cuban refugee, who came to the United States in 1969, called
himself ``America's No. 1 Stuntman,'' although it was his first
stunt. Masa claimed he had dangled from the 105-year-old landmark
for seven hours.
   ``I planned for three months to do something real crazy to get
into the Guinness record book,'' he said. Originally, he had
planned to don a Ninja costume, light six M-80 firecrackers and
hold two, 3-foot-long samurai swords and plunge off the bridge.
   But he changed his plans after the two nylon bags of equipment
made the 75-foot leap without him.
   Masa, who lost use of both legs after a shooting in 1977, said
his making the Guinness Book of World Records would inspire other
paraplegics. ``They think that because they're in wheelchairs their
life is ended,'' he said.
   Masa was booked on charges of disorderly conduct, illegal
possession of a knife and dealing with fireworks, said police
spokesman Sgt. John Clifford.
   Masa, who also uses the name El-Shah Muhammed El-Ratuli and has
a minor criminal record dating to 1977, was given a summons to
appear in court Sept. 19.
   He initially told reporters his name was ``Megaman.'' He handed
out red, white and blue business cards that proclaimed, ``Living on
the edge is my business _ American No. 1 Stuntmen.''
   He said he was dropped off in the center of the span about
midnight by his brother, whom he refused to identify by name.
   Dragging his wheelchair and bags containing the swords and
firecrackers behind him, Masa crawled to the edge of the span,
where he tied a nylon cord used by mountain climbers around his
waist, through the wheelchair and secured it to a 5-inch thick
piece of bridgework. He then pushed the wheelchair off the bridge
and shimmied down the rope after it.
   Masa said he was not afraid while dangling. He was noticed after
dawn by a tugboat.
   According to the legend, in July 1886, Brodie, a 23-year-old
shoeshine man, took the leap from the bridge.
   Reporters were on hand to see what appeared to be a man dive 135
feet and emerge unscathed from the river. However, skeptics believe
that Brodie, with the help of cohorts, threw a weighted dummy into
the river.
   Masa expressed no remorse over the rush-hour traffic jam his
stunt caused. ``This is New York. They (the commuters) like the
excitement on Monday morning.''

   Police in Leningrad broke up a demonstration by
about 1,000 people who displayed placards and banners critical of
the Kremlin's handling of ethnic disputes, a Moscow activist
reported today.
   Police detained 27 of the participants and filed criminal
charges against 10 in the Monday night demonstration at Nevsky
Square, said Yevgenia Debryanskaya of the unofficial Democratic
Union political group.
   She said she was informed of the incident by telephone by Valery
Terekhov, a Democratic Union activist in Leningrad.
   The demonstrators displayed signs critical of the leadership's
handling of a dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over
control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, as well as other aspects of
relations among the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities, Ms.
Debryanskaya said.
   Participants also passed around pictures of victims of the Feb.
28 rioting in Sumgait, an Azerbaijani city where 32 were killed
when youths went on a rampage to protest the Armenian claims to
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
   Those arrested in the Leningrad demonstration face fines of $80,
Ms. Debryanskaya said.
   The Democratic Union was formed by activists in the spring to
serve as a rival political force to the Communist Party.
   The state-run press has denounced the organization as disruptive
and unconstitutional and authorities have harassed its members.

   Trustees of this tiny town, faced with a
new state law that prohibits hiring part-time police officers, have
ordered a ban on crime, accidents, emergencies and deaths on
Mondays and Tuesdays.
   Those are the marshal's days off.
   ``We are really a rather peaceful little town,'' Mayor John
Neill said Monday, admitting that the ban is to call attention to
the state law that took effect on July 1.
   ``One of the hardest things in the world is to get a bad law
repealed, and we wanted to make the point that the new state law is
kind of ridiculous.''
   The law prohibits communities from legally hiring part-time
officers, as Hotchkiss has done for years to cover vacations and
days off for full-time law officers.
   Neill said the western Colorado town of 780 residents can't
afford to hire another full-time officer.

<HEAD>Wildlife Officials Call Early Hunting to Rid Ranchers of Hungry
Deer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leroy Horn raises cattle and grows alfalfa at
his rural central Nevada spread, but this year's harvesting is
being done by hungry deer that have broken his fences, trampled the
ground and nibbled his hay.
   Horn's ranch is one of scores in Nevada where thousands of
marauding deer have found green fields tempting in this drought
year. A special hunting season has been called to thin their record
numbers.
   ``The deer come and mow the alfalfa down,'' Horn said Monday.
``I've got 35 acres but they just eat it as fast as it grows.
   ``Every year it seems like a few more deer come back.''
   The Nevada Department of Wildlife has come to the rescue by
calling an emergency early hunting season to trim the state's
record 250,000 deer herd.
   Twenty antlerless deer tags will go on sale for the area where
Horn lives beginning Wednesday with 170 to 200 more available in
other rural areas to control the deer depredation, officials said.
The permits will be good for about two weeks.
   Additional hunts are likely before the normal October through
December hunting season, said David Rice, a department spokesman.
   ``This isn't the first time we've had emergency depredation
hunts,'' Rice said. ``But this is pretty bad this year because we
have a record deer population.''
   The number of deer is the largest since records began in the
early 1960s, Rice said.
   Opening the hunting season early and in specific problem areas
is the best way to reduce the deer population when it intrudes on
ranchers and farmers, he said.
   Even so, Horn said he doesn't plan to kill a deer. ``I'll leave
that up to the hunters.''

<HEAD>Promiscuity, Unwanted Pregnancies On The Rise In Industrial
District</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Promiscuity, homosexuality and unwanted
pregnancies are on the rise in Shenzhen, a district near Hong Kong
where most of the factories are funded from abroad, a newspaper
reported today.
   The China Youth News called the developments ``serious social
problems'' and attributed them to a lack of men in the area.
   The report, rare for its explicitness, was the paper's second in
a week on the lives of the part-time women workers of Shenzhen.
   The first focused on labor strife in the area, one of four
Special Economic Zones set up by China in 1980 for factories and
businesses funded partly or wholly by foreign capital. It said 21
strikes broke out in the area in 1986 and 1987 and told of worker
exploitation, making an unprecedented call for a labor law to
protect workers.
   Today's report said there were 250,000 part-time women workers
in Shenzhen, in Guangzhou province.
   The women are in a particular bind because not being permanent
residents of the area, not many men want to marry them. In China,
if a person doesn't have a residence permit for a certain area,
they cannot live there on a permanent basis even if they marry a
native.
   The report said that in one factory, a plastic bag enterprise,
the number of part-time women workers outnumber men by 50 to one.
   ``Here women are everywhere,'' the paper said, ``so the area is
now called a `Woman's Kingdom.' ''
   The paper said that to help part-time women workers, some
districts of Shenzhen have set up sports complexes, clubs and dance
halls.
   ``But with their thirst for love and sex, the newness of these
facilities quickly fades,'' it said.
   The paper quoted one young woman as saying: ``Who isn't willing
to fall in love. After we work all day, who doesn't want to lay
one's head against the chest of a man. Even if I'm not married, I'm
willing.''
   A psychologist working for the Public Securuty Bureau was quoted
as saying that ``the womens' hearts are like kindling wood. When
they meet the fire of love, the flames will rage.''
   The paper said that even though most of the women have
difficulty getting married, many are getting pregnant anyway.
   In the Shekou industrial district, the paper said, the number of
unwanted pregnancies jumped from more than 200 in 1985 to more than
800 in 1987, out of a population of 10,000 part-time women workers.
   In the Nantou industrial area, the paper said more than half of
the divorces were caused because husbands had affairs with
part-time workers, the paper said.
   ``In addition,'' the paper said, ``there is homosexuality and
prostitution.'' It did not elaborate.
   Reports on prostitution and homosexuality are almost
non-existant in the Chinese press. Even though today's report did
not go into detail about their extent in Shenzhen, the report was
significant in that it raised the issues.
   The Chinese officially treat homosexuality as an illness.
Prostitution, which plagued China before the revolution in 1949,
has in recent years been making a steady comeback in some urban
areas.
   The paper said the problem of part-time women workers would not
be easily solved in Shenzhen.
   ``Some people say, just bring in more part-time men workers,''
the paper said. ``But that won't do, because the jobs aren't
suitable and there will still be the problem of residence cards.''
   ``No matter what,'' the report said, ``this problem won't easily
go away.''

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson has completed his
journey from religious broadcaster to presidential candidate and
back, returning to the Christian Broadcasting Network as co-host of
``The 700 Club.''
   ``For better or worse, the health of this ministry depends on
this program. It is our bread and butter,'' Robertson said Monday
after the first broadcast of the revamped program, which included
the introduction of a new co-host, Sheila Walsh, a gospel singer
and songwriter from Scotland.
   Robertson, who founded CBN, left the network in 1986 to pursue
his political goals. In 1987, when the Southern Baptist minister
formally announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential
nomination, he installed his son, Tim Robertson, as president of
CBN and one of three hosts of the program.
   During that period, donations dwindled. CBN officials blamed the
decline on scandals in other television ministries, changes in
``The 700 Club'' format and a poor economy in oil states where many
CBN donors live. Robertson later said his absence was the reason
for the drop.
   During that time, CBN laid off more than 1,000 employees _ about
half its workforce _ and cut its operating budget by more than 40
percent.
   Ratings for ``The 700 Club'' also dropped, giving rise to the
format unveiled Monday.
   Gone were the dramatic recreations of religious conversions and
the public prayers for healing that marked the old program.
   Robertson said the new formula for the 90-minute program will be
one-third news, one-third ministry and teaching and one-third
lifestyle features.
   Robertson still plans to campaign for Vice President George Bush
during the presidential election.
   ``When I leave that desk,'' he said, pointing to the studio desk
from which he delivers the news and commentary segment of the
program, ``I am no longer a newsman. When I'm there, I will try to
report the news fairly.''

<HEAD>Crackdown Continues: Two Prominent Dissidents Arrested In Burma</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs with unconfirmed reports of Sein Lwin
assassination attempt. Picks up 5th graf pvs: Also, pamphlets ...</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   In a further crackdown on dissent,
authorities in Burma arrested two prominent war heroes for
allegedly plotting against the week-old government of President
Sein Lwin, sources said today.
   The arrests came as Amnesty International, the London-based
international human rights group, criticized the hardline one-party
government for arresting up to 25 other opponents in recent days.
   The arrests of Ta Ya and Yan Nyang, who helped lead the fight
for Burmese independence during World War II, is part of an
apparent government attempt to to root out potential threats,
diplomatic sources in Rangoon said.
   Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports from the Burmese capital said
Sein Lwin was the target of an assassination attempt on Friday by
an assistant who wounded him slightly in the arm, then killed
himself, sources said.
   ``The rumors are widespread enough to be taken seriously but we
cannot confirm them,'' a western diplomat reached in Rangoon said.
   The official Radio Rangoon said today that Sein Lwin had met
with members of the ``central organs of power'' Monday and
delivered a speech.
   In other developments, Western sources said about 500 students
and some Buddhist monks gathered Monday at the Shwedagon Pagoda,
Burma's holiest shrine and a traditional center for protest.
   Also, pamphlets have been circulating in the Burmese capital
calling for a nationwide general strike on Aug. 8.
   On Monday, the official News Agency Burma acknowledged the
arrest of the government's most outspoken critic, Aung Gyi, and
nine other people.
   The agency said Aung Gyi and the nine ``associates'' were
arrested on Saturday for ``attacking the state'' and would be
punished under criminal law.
   Aung Gyi emerged as the regime's leading critic this year in a
series of letters decrying economic and political conditions in
authoritarian Burma.
   He singled out Sein Lwin for ``turning a blind eye'' to gross
human rights abuses while overseeing the suppression of student
riots in March and June. Hundreds were killed in the violence.
   News Agency Burma's list of those arrested included Associated
Press correspondent Sein Win and a number of aging, retired
military officers who fell out of favor with former leader Ne Win
in the 1960s.
   The U.S. State Department and other sources said they believed
as many as 25 people may have been arrested in the sweep of
dissidents that netted Aung Gyi. Rangoon has mentioned only the 10
cited in the official media.
   Amnesty International has expressed concern over the arrests of
Aung Gyi and what it said were 24 of his friends and political
associates.
   Amnesty said it believed they may have been arrested ``for the
peaceful expression of their non-violent political beliefs.''
   ``At last report, they were held incommunicado without charge or
trial in Insein Central Prison, near Rangoon,'' it said in a
statement released Monday.
   The London-based International Press Institute, a media watchdog
group, protested the detention of Sein Win in a letter to Sein
Lwin, according to Peter Galliner, director of the institute.
   Ta Ya and Yan Nyang were members of a closely knit group of
young Burmese nationalists known as the ``Thirty Comrades'' or
``Thirty Heroes.''
   Hoping to rid Burma of British colonial rule, they sided with
the Japanese in the early stages of World War II but later fought
with the allies against Japan's forces in Burma.
   Their leader, Aung San, negotiated the end of colonial rule and
would undoubtably have become the country's first leaders if he had
not been assassinated in 1947. Ne Win was also among the thirty.
   Sein Lwin, a hardline, former military officer, took over the
chairmanship of the ruling Burma Socialist Program party one week
ago and was named president.
   The 77-year-old Ne Win stepped down a few days earlier after a
26-year rule marked by isolationist economic policies and
intolerance of free speech.
   Virtually all the country's institutes of higher learning were
closed in June. They are scheduled to reopen in mid-August.
   ``The unanswered question is whether the students and public can
translate distaste for Sein Lwin into action and what response the
army will have,'' one knowledgeable diplomat said.
   This source and others have noted that while Sein Lwin's
emergence has fueled protest, his recent moves have also left his
opponents with few if any real leaders.
   However, there is increasing speculation that a sizable number
of army officers are troubled by recent developments and owe little
loyalty to Sein Lwin.
   Travellers coming from Rangoon said there has been some ``panic
buying'' in recent days and the price of basic commodities has
risen sharply.
   The black market rate of the Burmese kyat has risen to eight
times the official rate of 6 kyat for one U.S. dollar.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Sweep Through Much Of The Nation As Heat Lingers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms swept from Michigan through South Dakota
early today as other storms thundered through the South, bringing
harsh winds and large hail. Temperatures remained high after a day
in which numerous heat records were broken.
   A tornado touched down briefly in a field just north of Nevis,
Nev., Monday night. No damage or injuries were reported. Hail
pummeled Holabird, S.D., and winds raced to 60 mph when
thunderstorms moved through the area.
   In northern Minnesota and southwest upper Michigan, strong winds
accompanying thunderstorms damaged trees and power lines in many
areas.
   Thunderstorms were spotty early this morning over central and
southeast Texas into parts of eastern Mississippi and western
Alabama. Other isolated storms hit parts of northeast Colorado,
northwest Arizona and southern Nevada, and from northern Georgia
into south central South Carolina.
   High temperatures continued to plague much of the nation early
today, following Monday's scorcher in which heat records were
broken in eight states.
   ``It's like a blast furnace out there,'' said Rich Naistat, a
forecaster in Minneapolis.
   Records were broken Monday in Michigan, Illinois, Iowa,
Wisconsin, South Carolina, Mississippi, Minnesota and Indiana.
   The night offered little relief. Temperatures were in the low to
mid 80s early this morning from the central Plains into the middle
and lower Missouri valleys into the western and central parts of
the lower Great Lakes.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from northern parts of the upper Great Lakes and the upper
Mississippi Valley into central North Dakota; showers and
thunderstorms developing through the eastern half of the Gulf Coast
region, Alabama, Florida and the along the coast of North Carolina;
showers and thunderstorms scattered through southwest Texas,
northwest Arizona, southwest Utah, and through parts of eastern
Colorado; showers through northwest Montana; and sunny and dry
throughout the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the low to mid 90s across
much of the nation; in the 70s and 80s along the Pacific Coast
through the Pacific Northwest, the northern Rockies and the
northern Plains into northwestern parts of the Great Lakes; in the
80s across the eastern half of New England; from the middle 90s to
105 degrees from the lower Great Lakes through the middle
Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys into central Kansas; and
between 100 and 110 degrees from the central California valleys
into the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 93 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Blazes Continue to Rage in Yellowstone; Headway Made Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fires fanned by gusty winds raged over thousands of acres in
Yellowstone National Park, while firefighters mopped up a
cigarette-ignited blaze in Idaho that officials said has cost $9
million.
   Firefighters also were working to contain or control fires in
Montana, Washington, Oregon and Utah.
   Weather forecasters offered some hope by forecasting rain for
today in Yellowstone. On Monday, winds estimated at 15 to 20 mph
pushed the Shoshone fire closer to Yellowstone Lake, forest
spokesman Larry Blade said. The fire grew by about 6,000 acres, to
19,100 acres.
   The nearby south entrance to the park was closed again Monday,
but officials hoped to reopen the gate today.
   The Red fire, south of the Shoshone, grew Monday by about 5,000
acres, and Blade said it may soon merge with the Shoshone fire.
   The wind helped instead of hindered firefighters at the
12,700-acre North Fork fire, as gusts pushed the blaze back into an
already burned area and strengthened the line on the south flank.
   ``It was and still is putting up one big smoke column though,''
Blade said.
   The Clover Mist fire in the northeast part of the park grew
5,700 acres since Saturday and has charred nearly 74,000 acres.
Blade said strong winds pushed the fire closer to its eastern
containment line
   Throughout Yellowstone, the oldest national park, roughly
140,000 acres have been blackened since late June when lightning
strikes opened the fire season a month earlier than usual.
   East of Yellowstone, in the Bighorn National Forest, nearly 800
firefighters battled three fires. Fire Information Officer Dave
Damron said the 1,800-acre Intermission fire was half-contained by
Monday evening, with full containment expected by Thursday night
and control by Friday evening.
   The Wyoming Travel Commission opened a hot line Monday to answer
tourists' questions about the fire at Yellowstone.
   ``The forest fires have certainly gained us national attention,
but we are concerned that tourists planning to visit Yellowstone
and the Cowboy State may change their plans,'' said commission
director Gene Bryan.
   In Idaho, firefighters in the Boise National Forest contained
the 5,000-acre Willis Gulch fire Monday evening. But more than
1,100 firefighters continued mopping up. The blaze, which was
started by a cigarette, has destroyed $7.5 million in timber and
other resources and cost $1.5 milion to fight, officials said.
   Forest officials said they expected to begin sending crews home
today.
   A beefed-up firefighting force worked through Monday night and
nearly contained the pesky Rock Creek fire in southwestern Montana.
Forest officials there also looked forward to a cooling trend and
possible rains today.
   About 200 firefighters joined another 630 people battling the
blaze, which has burned about 3,200 acres in the Bitterroot
National Forest and was more than 90 percent contained as of
Meonday night, said Jo Barnier, a fire information officer for the
forest.
   The additional manpower was used to add a night shift. Full
containment was expected tonight. Winds 40 mph hampered
firefighting efforts at Rock Creek on Monday, causing spot fires,
she said.
   A Texas man was charged Monday with failing to extinguish a
campfire, which fire officials say ignited the blaze.
   Firefighters contained a 1,500-acre brush fire in northern Utah.

   The Israeli Embassy thanked Peru for arresting
three men suspected of being members of the Palestinian terrorist
group and said their capture prevented attacks against diplomats.
   In a statement released Monday, the embassy thanked ``Peruvian
authorities and police for having frustrated the criminal attempt
of Palestine terrorists to attack Peruvian citizens and diplomats
of Israel and other countries.''
   The government on Friday said it had arrested Hocine Bouzidi,
36, who they said carried Algerian identity papers; Mohamed
Abdelrahman Abed, 19, of Egypt; and Ahmad Assaad Mohamed, 19, of
Lebanon.
   The government said Bouzidi was suspected of helping plan
simultaneous December 1985 raids at the Rome and Vienna airports in
which 14 people were killed and 120 were wounded.
   Police said an Interpol report listed Bouzidi as being a Central
Committee member of the radical Abu Nidal group, a splinter group
of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Police said he also was
linked to the November 1985 hijacking of an Egyptian jetliner in
which 59 people were killed when Egyptian troops stormed the craft
in Malta.
   They said their investigation indicated the suspects may have
been planning attacks against Peruvian, U.S. and Israeli targets in
Peru.
   A police spokesman said documents were recovered showing the men
kept the U.S. Consulate, the Israeli Embassy, the Synagogue of
Israel in Lima and the Israeli-owned Shalom travel agency under
surveillance. government since 1980.
   Officials said Saturday the three might be deported but did not
name a country or say if any extradition requests had been
received. Police said Bouzidi has been in Peru since mid-June and
the others seven months.

   U.S. and Filipino negotiators
unexpectedly resumed talks today on the status of American military
bases, a week after the negotiations broke down in a disagreement
over compensation.
   Members of the two negotiating teams met for more than two hours
at the Department of Foreign Affairs and agreed to meet again on
Wednesday. They refused to answer reporters' questions.
   In a joint statement, the sides said they discussed financial
compensation as well as security around the bases and the issue of
Filipino court jurisdiction over U.S. troops.
   ``The discussion of the compensation issue encompassed a variety
of economic options and the exchange of views will continue,'' the
statement said.
   Before the session a Filipino source close to the talks said the
Philippine panel expected the Americans to make a new offer on
compensation for use of the six installations, including Clark Air
Base and the Subic Bay naval base. Clark and Subic are the largest
U.S. military bases outside the United States.
   Earlier today, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus announced the
resumption of talks but would not tell reporters if any significant
breakthrough had been made. He said only that ``the situation seems
to warrant a resumption of the talks.''
   Manglapus, the chief Philippine negotiator, broke off the talks
one week ago over what he described as American inflexibility on
the amount of compensation.
   The United States currently pays the Philippines $180 million
annually in exchange for the bases. Sources close to the Philippine
panel said the Filipinos wanted the amount raised to $1.2 billion,
but the Americans refused.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Americans were willing to increase compensation only by $360
million. The Filipinos at first rejected a U.S. proposal to include
salaries paid to base workers and purchases of locally manufactured
goods in the compensation package.
   Asked whether the Filipinos would modify their demand, Manglapus
said: ``Our position has already been subjected to change and we
are not about to change it again.''
   American negotiators, headed by Ambassador Nicholas Platt, have
consistently refused to comment on the talks.
   But sources close to the talks said the Americans were reluctant
to agree to a drastic increase because of uncertainty over the
status of the bases after their lease expires in 1991.
   Any extension of the bases must be under a formal treaty
ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Phillipine Senate, where
opposition to them is strong.
   President Corazon Aquino, whose term expires in 1992, has
pledged to honor the current agreement but refuses to say whether
she will support an extension.
   In June, the Philippine Senate approved a bill banning nuclear
weapons and nuclear-powered warships from Philippine soil. Similar
legislation is pending in the House of Representatives. Filipino
sources say Washington has been lobbying against the bill.
   The base negotiations, which began four months ago, are actually
a review of a 1947 agreement giving the Americans right to operate
military bases in the Philippines. They are merely a review of what
terms, such as compensation, should apply during the agreement's
last two years.

<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of Lebanon's most
radical pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group was quoted today as saying
American hostages may be freed before the U.S. presidential
election.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah previously has predicted that
the fate of the nine American hostages would be determined during
or after the Nov. 8 election.
   Today, an Arab-language weekly quoted him as suggesting for the
first time that freedom for the hostages may come sooner.
   ``I do not have any detailed information on the hostages issue
within the context of U.S.-Iranian relations,'' Fadlallah was
quoted as saying in an interview published by the Paris-based
Mostakbal magazine.
   ``But I have a feeling that the problem of the hostages is an
essential factor in the American presidential election because
their card will be of no importance after the elections,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   Fadlallah is spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God. The
group is believed to be the umbrella organization for Shiite
militants holding most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   ``My feeling is that the American hostages issue will be
completely resolved just as the issue of the French hostages was,''
he was quoted as saying.
   The last three French hostages in Lebanon were freed May 4, a
few days before the French presidential election.
   Fadlallah was quoted as saying the United States and Iran were
bound to normalize relations now that the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war
is nearing an end.
   On Monday, an Anglican archbishop just back from a mission in
Tehran said Terry Waite, the kidnapped envoy of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and the other hostages might be released by the end of
the year.
   ``I would not be surprised if Terry Waite and the others were
released before the end of the year,'' David Penman, the archbishop
for Melbourne, said in Canterbury, England.
   The Church of England last week sent Bishop David Brown to
Lebanon to speak to Christian leaders about four Iranians who
disappeared in a Christian-controlled zone outside Beirut in 1982.
They were presumed kidnapped, and there been unconfirmed reports
they were killed.
   In addition to the nine Americans, the 18 foreign hostages
include three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian, an Indian, a West
German and two unidentified men. The longest held is Terry A.
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer, said it will start selling appliances and home
electronics made by other companies.
   Sixty national brands, including Sears' Kenmore appliances, will
be available Thursday at 13 Indiana stores, the company said Monday.
   That is a first step in a plan to sell other brands at its
stores nationwide, said Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive
officer of Sears Merchandise Group.
   Telephones, stereo equipment, televisions, electronic office
equipment and kitchen appliances are among the products to be
offered, said Marvin Stern, a company vice president.
   Sears now operates 819 retail stores and more than 3,000 other
catalog and specialty stores in all 50 states and Puerto Rico,
company officials said.
   Sears holds 25 percent of the country's appliance market and its
Kenmore brand is the country's biggest seller.

<HEAD>US Defense Chief Sees Top-Secret Soviet Bomber</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Carlucci inspecting Soviet bomber,

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military unveiled its new top-secret
Blackjack bomber to U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today and
staged thundering aerial and artillery displays at two bases
normally off-limits to foreigners.
   Carlucci spent about 10 minutes in the cockpit of the strategic
bomber while foreign reporters were allowed within about 50 yards
of the sleek white jet. Soviet military brass were clearly
uncomfortable with the access accorded the visitors and refused to
tell reporters anything about the plane.
   ``Why do you want to know about the bomber? Why frighten
people?'' asked Col. Gen. Boris F. Korolkov.
   He refused to identify the aircraft, whose only markings were a
red star and a No. 12 on the tail.
   The Pentagon's reference book Soviet Military Power says the
plane is the world's heaviest and largest bomber, but does not give
exact dimensions.
   Jane's All The World's Aircraft, a respected British reference
book, says the plane, codenamed Blackjack by NATO, is known in the
Soviet Union as the Tupolev strategic bomber. It says the jet is
177 feet long, has a wingspan of 182 feet and weighs 550,000 pounds.
   The aircraft has been under development for 10 years, can travel
twice the speed of sound, has a flying range of 4,500 miles and can
be armed with bombs and cruise missiles, according to Jane's.
   No Western official had been shown the plane before Carlucci's
visit to the Kubinka airfield 30 miles west of Moscow.
   Jane's and the U.S. Defense Deparment predicted the Blackjacks
would be deployed this year. Korolkov said they became operational
``recently.''
   Carlucci first inspected a MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet before
turning to the nearby Blackjack. As he did, two Blackjack bombers
flew overhead in formation in the partly cloudy blue sky, and the
roar of their engines broke the silence of the largely deserted
airfield.
   Carlucci inspected the underbelly of the four-engine Blackjack
and then climbed orange stairs into the open bomb bay doors and
entered the cockpit. He told reporters later he could not give
technical details of the plane but compared it to the B-1 bomber of
the United States in that it can fly at low altitudes and carry
heavy payloads.
   ``I'm not a qualified intelligence officer,'' said Carlucci, a
former senior official with the CIA. ``I'm not a qualified
observer. They let me sit in the cockpit but I couldn't tell one
instrument from another.''
   The American defense chief, who arrived in the Soviet Union on
Monday for a four-day visit, said the tour was largely symbolic.
   ``It's a way of continuing the dialogue between our two military
establishments,'' Carlucci said.
   The Soviet military chief of staff, Marshal Sergei F.
Akhromeyev, climbed aboard a B-1 bomber at Ellsworth Air Force Base
in South Dakota last month.
   At Kubinka, Carlucci also inspected an Ilyushin-78 tanker plane
and an Mi-26 helicopter, and was treated to an acrobatic flying
display by four MiG-29s.
   Next it was the army's turn to put on a show for Carlucci. He
drove to the Taman Motorized Division Headquarters 12 miles to the
southwest to watch noisy and dusty war games.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, the host of Carlucci's
visit, stood next to his American counterpart on a two-story
building overlooking a vast field. Soviet Mi-24 helicopter gunships
shot out from behind the buildings, guns firing, and artillery
shells bombarded targets in the field, spewing gray-black smoke and
dirt.
   ``It's not very comfortable to drive,'' quipped Yazov as
infantry fighting vehicles bumped along the dirt.
   After the display, Carlucci asked Yazov's 10-year-old grandson
if he wanted to shoot like the soldiers. The grandson, Oleg Losik,
appeared to be too shy to answer.
   Later, Oleg, wearing a military officer's jacket to keep warm,
told a reporter the war games were ``very interesting'' and that
they were only the second he'd seen.
   On Wednesday, Carlucci heads to the Soviet Crimean Peninsula,
where he will visit the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet.
   Among those traveling with Carlucci are Ron Lehman, assistant
secretary of defense, and representatives of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and State Department.

<TEXT>
   Israel's ambassador to the United States said
today that the decision by King Hussein of Jordan to cut his ties
to the West Bank will make the peace process more difficult, but
may not be cast in stone.
   Moshe Arad said on NBC's ``Today'' show that he believes
Hussein's decision ``is not irreversible. In any case, it will not
help the peace process.''
   ``While he made the dramatic gesture, he left some roads open
and it's premature to decide whether this is a tactical or a
strategic decision,'' Arad said.
   The Reagan Administration, meanwhile, is sticking to its formula
for Arab-Israeli peace talks despite Hueesin's decision.
   The U.S. plan calls for a mixed delegation of Jordanians and
Palestinians to negotiate with Israel. Even before Hussein's
statement Sunday abandoning the West Bank to the Palestine
Liberation Organization, the United States had made little progress
in trying to promote negotiations.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy, who was heading
toward the Middle East, already was scheduled for talks in Egypt,
Israel, Jordan and Syria. Now he has the added job of seeking an
explanation from Hussein and to determine if prospects for peace
talks are even dimmer.
   In the meantime, the State Department asserted Monday there
would be no immediate change in the U.S. approach to resolving the
40-year Arab-Israeli dispute.
   ``Our position on how to begin peace negotiations is unchanged,
and we remain actively engaged,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   Hussein's declaration Sunday severed Jordan's ``legislative and
administrative links'' to the Israeli-held West Bank that was ruled
by Jordan between 1948 and 1967. Israel has controlled the
territory and the Gaza Strip since winning a six-day war against an
Egyptian-Jordanian-Syrian alliance in 1967. The population is
predominantly Palestinian Arab.
   The king's announcement apparently did not take U.S. officials
by surprise.
   ``We had intimations,'' said one official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``We did not have a text, but we had an
idea in general.''
   Hussein made the speech after a series of moves in which Jordan
seemed to be separating itself from the West Bank even though most
of the Palestinians hold Jordanian citizenship and U.S. policy in
the Mideast for 21 years has been based on the idea that the king
wanted to recover the territory.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who made four trips to the
region this year, pushed for an Israeli withdrawal while also
informing Jordan that a total retreat was ``not in the cards.''
   Murphy is due to fly to the Middle East after winding up talks
today in Geneva, Switzerland, with Vladimir Polyakov, the senior
Mideast expert in the Soviet Union's foreign ministry.
   Department officials said last week that Murphy would like to
talk to ``responsible Palestinians'' while he is in the Middle
East, but that U.S. policy still prohibited any discussion with the
PLO, whose covenant calls for the destruction of Israel as a Jewish
state.
   Hussein's detachment from the West Bank could be a blow to U.S.
hopes to set up Arab-Israeli peace talks. The king long has
supported publicly the unanimous decision of Arab governments that
the PLO was the only legitimate representative of Palestinians.
Still, the Reagan administration and its predecessors had tried to
engage him in peace talks over the West Bank's future.
   Shultz ran into a roadblock with both Hussein and Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Hussein insisted on a commitment in
advance that Israel would give up the West Bank and Gaza. Shamir
refused. The Israeli leader also opposed a peace conference in
which the Soviet Union might have a chance to influence the outcome.
   Despite the setbacks, the United States pursued Hussein as a
force for moderation. Even after Jordan said last week it would
abandon an assistance program for Palestinians on the West Bank, a
U.S. official said privately that the move might have been
calculated to show the PLO was incapable of taking over.
   With Murphy en route to Jordan, the State Department tried to
strike a positive stance and keep Hussein engaged.
   ``We welcome the fact that King Hussein in his speech
underscored Jordan's commitment to continue in the peace process,''
Mrs. Oakley said. ``The Jordanian role in a Mideast peace process
remains essential. We said repeatedly Palestinians also must
participate at every stage of the process and we hope that they
will meet this challenge by seeking responsible dialogue with
Israel.''
   Her statement continued: ``It's not yet clear what effect
Jordan's pronouncements will have on the situation. We will
maintain our close contacts with Jordan as well as the other
involved parties in advancing the peace process.''
   On a related subject, the State Department sharply criticized
Israel for arresting a prominent Palestinian activist in Jerusalem
on Sunday. The jailing of Faisal Husseini, 41, followed a speech he
gave four days earlier calling for a compromise between Israel and
Palestinians.
   ``We oppose Israel's use of administrative detention in the
occupied territories,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``We are seeking
information about the nature of the charges. ...
   ``If Mr. Husseini acted illegally, he should be charged and
tried in a court with appropriate open judicial processes. ... We
always encourage Palestinians who seek compromise and accommodation
with Israel. We think the Israeli government also should encourage
dialogue with Palestinians.
   ``In the absence of evidence that Husseini is involved in
illegal acts, we believe that the decision to detain him can only
discourage those Palestinians who advocate peace and reconciliation
with Israel,'' the spokeswoman said.

been used to deliver illegal drugs, Lt. Tom Hull said on Monday.
   ``That's our impression,'' Hull said. ``You see it going down
the road, who's going to stop it?''
   Officers arrested John Gilbert Nunes, 41, and DeAnn Marie Stone,
20, on Friday, he said. They also seized $9,000, a submachine gun
and nearly a dozen other weapons, as well as seven pounds of
methamphetamine and a half-pound of cocaine, Hull said. Police put
the value of the drugs at $300,000.
   Investigators said they are not sure what police agency once
owned the car.
   ``We auction them off,'' Hull said. ``It could be anybody's.''
   Stone was booked for investigation of methamphetamine for sale.
Nunes faces a half-dozen additional charges, including possession
of a machine gun, possession of an explosive device and possession
of a sawed-off shotgun.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Nude Sunbathing Not A Constitutional Right</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nude sunbathing on public beaches is not
a constitutional right, according to a judge who refused to grant
an injunction that would have reopened an environmentally protected
area to naturists.
   ``While nudity is the privacy of one's own property and nudity
in the context of artistic expression may be protected, it seems
clear that nude sunbathing on a public beach is not a right of
constitutional dimension,'' U.S. District Judge Ernest C. Torres
wrote Monday.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service closed a one-mile stretch of
Moonstone Beach in South Kingstown from April 1 to Aug. 31. to
protect two species of shore birds, the piping plover and the least
tern.
   The New England Naturist Association sued the federal
government, claiming their constitutional rights were violated by
the closure, which included a narrow strip of beach traditionally
opened to nude sunbathers.
   ``In this case, it is not nude sunbathing that has been banned
on Moonstone Beach. What has been prohibited is any use of the
disputed area,'' the judge said.
   Torres, who heard testimony in May, said the naturists had
``failed to demonstate a likelihood of success'' for their case.

<HEAD>Judge Warns Man To Stay Away From Buses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who says buses are so near to his heart
that he stole as many as 100 of them was ordered to keep them at
arm's length for 10 years or go to prison.
   Patrick Carl Johnson, 23, put on uniforms and persuaded bus
company officials to let him drive buses away from their lots,
sometimes on jaunts of several hundred miles, police said.
   Johnson told police he loves buses so much that he has stolen
dozens, perhaps nearly 100, since 1986, they said.
   Visiting District Judge Randy Stout on Monday banned Johnson
from buses for a decade.
   ``Next time you set your foot on a bus, or go around a bus, you
can go to prison for 10 years,'' he said.
   Johnson pleaded guilty to stealing a 1983 Trailways Eagle bus
worth $195,000 on June 11. His punishment was 10 years of
probation, 30 days in Harris County Jail, 300 hours of community
service and $200 restitution for a broken window.
   Johnson was arrested after an eight-minute chase through narrow,
congested streets in Houston, police Sgt. David J. Klinger said.
   ``The officers said, `This guy can really drive a bus,'''
Klinger said. ``Even on those narrow streets he didn't hit a thing
except one street sign.''
   The sign broke the window.
   ``He took all those buses, and the total damages were $200,''
Klinger marveled. ``That's probably a better history of damages
than most of their drivers have.''
   Johnson told police, Klinger said, that his love for buses stems
from the time his mother dated a bus driver, and Johnson, then 11,
rode for hours at a time.
   Klinger said Johnson told him he never sped and one occasion his
stolen bus broke down after he took a group of his relatives on an
outing. Johnson called the same wrecker company that Kerrville Bus
Co. uses.
   ``I didn't want just anybody towing that bus,'' Klinger quoted
Johnson as saying. ``They might have torn it up.''
   Prosecutor Don Calvert said Johnson was careful about
maintenance of the buses and washed and refueled them before they
were returned or abandoned.

   Iranian media reports said millions of
people rallied across Iran today in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and the Islamic revolution that brought him to power.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency compared the
gatherings to the demonstrations that swept Iran when Khomeini
returned from exile on Feb. 1, 1979, after the overthrow of the
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   ``History is once again repeated to mark another occasion _ `To
renew allegiance to the Imam,''' IRNA said.
   The rally in Tehran was organized by Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri in support of Khomeini's decision, announced July 18, to
accept a year-old U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire in the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, the press reports said.
   A rally was also held in the western city of Ahvaz, where
President Ali Khamenei addressed the crowd. The Iranian reports
indicated demonstrations were held in other cities, but gave no
specifics.
   Those participating in Tehran converged on the city's Azadi
Square early today to recite verses from the Koran, chant slogans
and listen to a resolution outlining support for Khomeini.
   Many carried pictures of relatives and loved ones killed or
taken prisoner in the Iran-Iraq war, IRNA said. It said the crowds
were served water and soft drinks because of the heat and air force
helicopters whirred overhead, dropping flowers on the crowd.
   The resolution read in Tehran included promises to obey all
Khomeini's orders, to recognize Montazeri as his successor and to
seek peace in the war with Iraq.
   It also called for revenge against the United States and Saudi
Arabia for the death of Iranians at last year's Islamic pilgrimage
in Mecca and condemned the United States for shooting down an
Iranian passenger jet.
   A U.S. Navy ship shot down the plane July 3 in the mistaken
belief that it was an F-14 fighter jet.

<HEAD>Police: Toll Taker Opened Her Own Lanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida Turnpike toll booth
manager took over a lane and pocketed up to $15,000 in tolls,
officials said.
   ``It was the Lorna J. Hoff Expressway,'' said Tim Valentine, a
Palm Beach State Attorney official who headed the investigation.
   Ms. Hoff, 33, admitted to having pilfered ``several hundred
dollars'' worth of tolls ``two or three'' times following her
promotion to toll booth manager in March.
   But state officials estimated she could have taken as much as
$15,000.
   Department of Transportation and state attorney's office
investigators arrested Ms. Hoff on April 2 as she left the Palm
Beach Gardens Interchange with $844 and 750 toll tickets, according
to Valentine.
   Prosecutors agreed to drop charges when Ms. Hoff offered to pay
back the $844 and participate in a pre-trial intervention program.
They took into account her 10-year employment with the DOT and no
prior criminal record.
   The DOT, however, refused to consent to the deal and is pursuing
grand theft charges against Ms. Hoff, who was dismissed from her
$17,394-a-year job.
   John Berry, DOT chief of toll facilities, explained that further
investigation showed that Ms. Hoff may have diverted tolls from a
single lane about 14 times.
   Berry said evidence indicated that Ms. Hoff, who as manager was
not supposed to work a toll booth, took regular attendants off the
schedule and put herself on an operating lane.
   Her alleged scam was noticed because the regular attendants were
logged in for the day's work, but their end-of-day receipts were
not reported. In addition, he said, other attendants at the
interchange reported Ms. Hoff's behavior as suspicious.

<HEAD>Eight-Year-Old Boy Freed After 17 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOCRI, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old Italian boy was released by
his abductors today in the mountains of Calabria after a 17-month
kidnapping that prompted appeals for his release by Pope John Paul
II.
   Marco Fiora, kidnapped in Turin on March 2, 1987, walked to a
forest ranger's station in the Aspromonte mountains after being
freed at about 8 a.m., police said.
   The boy was immediately taken to a police barracks in this
southern Italian town, where he was examined by a doctor and
pronounced in fair condition, according to Lt. Col. Sabato Palazzo.
   Italian news agencies reported the boy looked exhausted and
there were rope marks on his wrists. Wearing a dirty white shirt
and pants held up by a string, Marco was given a bath and clean
clothes by the wife of a police officer.
   ``Mama, I'm okay, but I'm so scared,'' he said to his mother,
Piera, who spoke with him by phone from Turin.
   Marco was kidnapped by a gang of masked and armed bandits as his
parents were driving him to school. Riding in two cars, the bandits
blocked the Fiori's vehicle, beat the parents and sped off with the
boy.
   The kidnappers demanded a ransom of about $4 million. Marco's
parents, who run a garage and bakery in Turin, said they were
unable to pay the high sum. In December, the family delivered
$220,000 as a first ransom installment.
   News agencies said the father, Gianfranco Fiora, arrived in
Calabria a few days ago to pay the second installment. But the
ransom was never paid, and the kidnappers apparently decided to
free the boy because extensive police patrols had begun in the area.
   Numerous public appeals were made for Marco's release during the
17 months, including several by the pope, who last made an appeal
during a Sunday blessing in February.
   In May, four people were arrested in Turin and Calabria on
charges of complicity in the kidnapping.

   Israeli troops shot and killed an 18-year-old
Palestinian and wounded four others in clashes in the occupied West
Bank today as Arabs closed businesses for a second day to protest
deportations.
   The clash occurred in the West Bank's largest city of Nablus,
where soldiers opened fire after a military patrol was stoned, said
an official at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital.
   The victim, identitied as Alla Edin Al Aghbar, was hit by a
bullet in the stomach, the hospital official said.
   Two other Palestinian teen-agers were hit in the legs by bullets
in the same clash today, the hospital official said. The army said
it was checking the reports.
   In a second incident, soldiers shot and wounded two Arabs in the
legs in the town of Dura after masked Palestinians stoned a patrol
and tried to prevent Arab laborers from boarding a bus to work in
Israel, Arab news reports said.
   The army confirmed the clash but said it had no further details.
   The death raised to 236 the number of Arabs killed since the
uprising broke out Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died.
   In a move prompted by eight months of Palestinian unrest, King
Hussein of Jordan announced Sunday he was severing legal and
administrative links with the West Bank that he ruled until Israel
captured it in 1967.
   Pro-Jordanian Palestinians in the territory were angered by the
move, but a majority praised the monarch for ceding control over
them to the PLO. The uprising has been led by underground leaders
tied to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Arabs shuttered their stores and halted public transportation
today to protest the expulsions Monday of eight reputed leaders of
the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Israeli army's chief prosecutor said the eight Palestinians
were expelled to deter further violence in the territories.
   Lt. Col. Amnon Strasnov said on Israel army radio that Israel
had ``no choice'' but to expel the eight. Western countries,
including the United States, say Israel's deportation policy
violates human rights.
   ``This step of expulsion is definitely a deterrent. People fear
it more than lengthy detentions,'' Strasnov said.
   He added: ``From a legal standpoint, they (the deportees) could
not have been put on trial. There is no acceptable evidence for the
court.''
   He did not elaborate, but a military official said the eight
could not be taken to court because the evidence was either
top-secret or sketchy. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Monday's expulsions brought to 29 the number of Palestinians
deported since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   The deportees, six from the West Bank and two from the Gaza
Strip, were flown by helicopter to southern Lebanon and then placed
in waiting taxis taking them further north.
   Also Monday, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres acknowledged that no
progress would be made in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict until
after the November elections in Israel and the United States.
   Hussein's decision was a setback for Peres' Labor Party which
had campaigned for the so-called ``Jordanian option'' _ resolving
the dispute with the Palestinians by negotiating with Jordan.
   But Peres suggested Jordan could be drawn back into the peace
process if Labor formed the next government. ``The elections will
determine if the Jordanian option is dead or not,'' Peres said.
   In a related development, state-run Jordan television cancelled
weather reports and a Palestinian program for the Israeli-occupied
territories, the television's news editor said today in Amman, the
Jordanian capital.
   The editor, Alfred Asfoor, said the cancellations were part of
Hussein's move to sever administrative and legal links.
   ``I am sure that Palestinians there are disturbed by our
action,'' he told The Associated Press, adding that the programs
might be aired again in the future.

   More than 4,000 teachers assigned to
maintain security at schools and colleges were relieved of the
additional duty today, officials said. Many of the appointees had
been accused of spying for the government.
   An Education Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the four-decade-old practice of having each public
school appoint one of its teachers to be responsible for
``maintaining school security'' was abolished to help promote
democracy on campuses.
   The ministry notified about 4,000 public colleges, elementary
and high schools throughout the island Monday to dismiss the
security officers, ministry officials said. The affected employees
will retain their jobs as teachers.
   Many of the security officers have been accused of filing false
reports on outspoken teachers who did not agree with the ruling
Nationalist Party and its authoritarian rule in Taiwan.
   The Association for Promoting Teachers' Rights has said the
security system has interfered with freedom of speech on campuses.
The association was formed by hundreds of teachers last year after
Taiwan lifted martial law.

   The Queen Elizabeth 2 sailed from the port of
Southampton today in the early morning hours, six hours late on its
first voyage to New York since new $3.5 million propellers were
installed.
   The luxury liner, which departed at 2 a.m., was delayed because
the crew was testing the propellers, according to Eric Flounders, a
spokesman for the ship's owner, the Cunard Steamship Co. PLC.
   More than 1,700 passengers paid up to $5,950 for the voyage.
   The 19-year-old liner last year underwent a $190 million
overhaul at Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, West Germany. The
liner was sent back last month after a new, fuel-saving type of
propeller caused problems.
   Flounders said LLoyd Werft refitted the QE2 with traditional
propellers at a cost of nearly $3.5 million.

<HEAD>Scientists Uncover Force That Boosts Gravity's Pull</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts throughout to clarify, include mention of Boynton
research in Washington; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experiment beneath the Greenland ice
sheet has fueled the debate over the existence of a ``fifth force''
in nature, and whether gravity might be more complex than Sir Isaac
Newton thought.
   Researchers last year lowered a gravity meter down a 1\-mile
hole and found that gravity diminished faster than expected,
indicating a second pull at work and was being reduced as the meter
descended, geophysicist Mark Ander reported Monday at a meeting at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
   The strength of the second pull is about one-fiftieth that
conventionally assigned to gravity, said Ander. The force has been
measured over distances ranging from 1,600 to 5,500 feet, enhancing
gravity by up to 3.9 percent.
   Other experiments have raised the possibility of a fifth or even
a sixth that either attract or repel objects in contradiction to
Newton's theories. The four known forces are gravity;
electromagnetism, which holds atoms together; the strong nuclear
force that holds atomic nuclei together; and the weak nuclear
force, which causes radioactive decay.
   Los Alamos scientists said their discovery may be the
theoretical fifth force or a component of gravity.
   ``Either way, we're saying something pretty big, something you
don't say every day in physics,'' Ander told The Washington Post.
``We're saying we appear to have the cleanest evidence to date of
something that cannot be explained by Newtonian gravity.''
   A change in the understanding of gravity may help physicists
formulate a long-sought ``unified field theory'' to explain all the
forces of the universe in a single equation. It also might lead to
recalculation of the masses of the stars and planets, and new
estimates of the universe's age.
   ``Gravity could be more complicated than Newton or even Einstein
thought,'' said Richard Hughes, a physicist at Los Alamos.
   Newton suggested in 1687 that gravity causes all bodies to
attract each other and that the attraction increases as the weight
of the objects increase and the distance between them decreases. He
suggested that gravitational fields should decline slightly as a
body moves down a shaft, but concluded that gravitational
acceleration is always the same.
   Australian scientist Frank Stacey said he found discrepancies
when he measured gravitational fields in a mine shaft in 1981. He
reported that the fields dropped off more rapidly than Newton's
conclusions suggested.
   Newtonian theory says gravity should change in a certain way
because, as a meter goes down, there is less matter below it to
exert a pull.
   Paul Boynton, a University of Washington physicist-astronomer,
reported last year that he had found evidence of a force that would
make a feather fall ever so slightly faster than an iron ball.
   Boynton suspended a 3-inch metal ring horizontally at the base
of 400-foot granite cliff in the North Cascade mountains near
Index, Wash. Half of the ring was aluminum, the other half
beryllium. Both halves had the same mass, which is what gives an
object weight when the object is pulled by gravity.
   Newtonian theory says the two halves should have been pulled
toward the cliff equally if only gravity was working. The aluminum
half twisted slightly toward the cliff and the beryllium half
rotated away, suggesting a force acting on the basis of the two
halves' chemical composition.
   Donald Eckhardt of the Air Force Geophysical Laboratory reported
late last year that gravitational-field measurements made from a
2,000-foot TV tower also revealed discrepancies. And, like Stacey's
findings, it suggested a force that attracts rather than repels.
   Ander said the Greenland experiment was concluded before
Eckhardt released his findings and that the researchers had not
expected to find a force that enhances gravity's pull. ``That was a
big surprise,'' he said.
   Others working on the Greenland project with Los Alamos were the
Scripps Institution at the University of California at San Diego;
Amoco Production Co.; Air Force Geophysical Lab; and the National
Science Foundation.
   Another experiment is under way in the Pacific Ocean a few
hundred miles north of Hawaii, with gravity measurements two miles
deep, Ander said. Some preliminary results are expected by the end
of the year.
   The team also hopes to test a deep hole in Antarctica near the
Soviet Union's Vostok station during 1990-91, he said.

   A suspect bit the ear of a
4-year-old police dog and injured the animal's neck during a chase
and arrest, police said today.
   The dog, Rex, was on patrol with Constable Philip Rajah in the
Natal provincial capital during the weekend when they came across
two ``suspicious individuals,'' police said.
   While Rajah searched one man, Rex chased the other _ and got the
worst of it when his quarry turned on the animal and bit him.
   Rajah had to yank the man off the dog, police said.
   They said the dog was being treated for a serious neck injury at
a veterinary clinic.
   The man who bit the dog may face a charge of malicious injury to
state property.

   Warning signals along the track could have
prevented a head-on collision of two freight trains that killed two
crewmen and forced as many as 2,000 people from their homes for
three days, an investigator said.
   The signal lights had been vandalized after Rock Island Lines
abandoned the line in 1980, said Dennis Shaffer, vice president for
marketing of Iowa Interstate Railroad, which took over the tracks
in 1984.
   Signal lights warn train operators of approaching traffic.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Edward
Dobranetski also said the trains wouldn't have crashed Saturday if
they had followed their schedules. ``We don't know if one left
early or the other was running late,'' he said.
   The railroad, Shaffer said Monday, had complied with Federal
Railroad Administration regulations by operating trains through
orders transmitted by radio or telephone from dispatchers.
   The westbound train was to have cleared the track by 11:56 a.m.
_ while the eastbound train was not to have left Altoona until
12:01 p.m., Dobranetski said. Federal investigators, he said,
planned to check police logs and canvass residents to determine
exactly when the trains crashed, he said.
   The tracks, just east of Altoona in central Iowa, were to be
reopened this afternoon, officials said.
   Residents were allowed to return home Monday night after
firefighters spent three days battling burning alcohol from two
tanker cars they feared might explode, said Police Chief Britt
Adair.
   The bodies of William Peers of Des Moines and Larry Buckingham
Jr. of Winterset were recovered from beneath tank cars, which each
held 20,000 gallons of denatured alcohol.
   Dobranetski also said his team was checking on the hazardous
materials in the train and the safety devices and operating methods
used by the railroad.
   The highly volatile alcohol kept the situation tense throughout
the weekend. Fears of explosion delayed attempts to recover the
bodies as fires continued to burn from escape valves in the tankers.
   One of the cars burned itself out Monday but a foot-high flame
continued to burn on the other until Monday night.
   Federal officials interviewed the two employees on the eastbound
train who jumped to safety before the collision, Orville Harger,
51, of Johnston, and Dennis Schrader of Indianola.
   Dobranetski declined to discuss the interviews. The NTSB is not
expected to issue a ruling on the accident's cause for six to nine
months.
   The crash occurred when the Council Bluffs to Chicago train,
pulling 78 cars, collided with the westbound Newton to Des Moines
train, pulling eight cars.

   George P. Shultz and four Central American
foreign ministers called for peace and democracy in the region in a
watered-down declaration lacking the denunciation of Nicaragua the
U.S. envoy had sought.
   In fact, the document they issued Monday during the secretary of
state's eight-hour stop did not even mention Nicaragua by name.
   Only at a later news conference was the country named when
Shultz expressed continued U.S. support for the Contra rebels, who
after nearly 7 years of war reached a preliminary cease-fire accord
in March with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Shultz flew today to Buenos Aires, Argentina, the second stop of
a nine-country tour of Latin America.
   The final version of the declaration _ signed by Shultz and the
foreign ministers of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa
Rica after a three-hour meeting _ called for ``peace, democracy,
security, social justice and economic development'' in the region.
   In the statement, the parties ``reaffirmed that authentic
democracy require, among other requisites, political pluralism,
freedom of association, freedom of the press, an impartial justice
system that guarantees due process, an apolitical armed forces, an
honest and open electoral system and respect for human and
individual rights.''
   The Sandinistas have been criticized for maintaining a political
monopoly and suppressing dissent and talks with the Contras on
forging a lasting peace have stalled.
   Senate Republican leaders are working on legislation in Congress
which would provide the Contras with $27 million in humanitarian
aid and include an additional $20 million that would be set aside
for possible new military assistance. President Reagan has
indicated he supports such a bill.
   The last congressional appropriation for military aid ran out in
February. It has not been renewed, largely pending the outcome of a
year-old regional peace plan that has so far proved ineffective.
   Shultz said the Contras ``are an important element, expressing a
strong desire for freedom and democracy in Nicaragua and we
continue to support them.
   ``I didn't come here basically to discuss that subject, and we
didn't have very much discussion of it, although I certainly hope
that we will extend funding for the Contras.''
   Monday's 10-paragraph document differed sharply from an initial,
10-page draft that harshly criticized Nicaragua as failing to live
up to the peace plan the five Central American presidents signed
Aug. 7, 1987.
   The original draft, written shortly after Shultz's last visit to
the four countries, was softened at the insistence of Guatemala and
Costa Rica, which apparently felt tough language would encourage
the Sandinistas to adopt an even harder line.
   Honduras, which favors the hard line against Nicaragua, made
public some of the criticism of the Sandinistas contained in the
initial draft, calling Guatemala's and Costa Rica's attitude
``incomprehensible'' and ``strange.''
   A Honduran statement Sunday said the original draft criticized
Nicaragua for not separating its army from the governing party and
denounced ``subversion against democratic governments'' by
Nicaragua.
   Shortly after he arrived in Guatemala on Monday, Shultz
contrasted what he described as democracy and growing prosperity in
the four nations with Nicaragua, where he said nine years of
Sandinista rule have virtually destroyed the economy.
   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega on Monday accused the
United States of trying to encourage anti-Sandinista aggression
with Shultz' visit.
   ``We hope that common sense might prevail, because to want to
sign a death sentence against Nicaragua, because the United States
wants one, would be the equivalent of signing a death sentence
against Central America,'' he said during a ceremony on the
Sandinista air force's ninth anniversary.
   Ortega expressed ``hope that these (Central American)
governments might be sufficiently reasonable and pragmatic so as
not to fall in the trap that the United States is laying in
Guatemala.''
   The United States and the four nations shared common goals of
democracy, the rule of law and economic progress, but admitted
problems existed in reaching those objectives, Shultz told
reporters shortly after he arrived, as he went into a meeting with
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Shultz's 10-day trip will also take him to Uruguay, Brazil and
Bolivia, and back to Central America Aug. 8-9 for meetings with the
presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.

   Police today arrested two cemetery
workers who allegedly damaged the tomb of President Corazon
Aquino's husband, the president's spokesman said.
   Sen. Benigno Aquino's tomb apparently was damaged in hopes the
vandalism would cause the firing of two security guards with whom
the cemetery workers had recently had a fight, presidential press
secretary Teodoro Benigno said.
   The vandalism occurred Friday and was discovered Saturday when
authorities at Manila Memorial Park cemetery received a telephone
warning that a bomb had been planted in Aquino's concrete tomb, a
military official said.
   Maj. Hernando Patawaran of the Presidential Security Group said
the vandals pried loose a slab of concrete from the top of the
tomb. He said explosives experts found no explosives.
   Workers reinforced the tomb with steel sheets and resealed it.
   Benigno said the vandalism upset Mrs. Aquino.
   ``The president was very much affected by the news that the tomb
... was vandalized because if there is any tomb in the Philippines
today that draws universal respect and admiration, it is the tomb
of Ninoy,'' Benigno said. Ninoy was the former senator's nickname.
   Aquino was shot and killed at Manila airport on Aug. 21, 1983 as
he returned from three years of voluntary exile in the United
States. The murder fueled opposition to President Ferdinand Marcos
which culminated in the civilian-military revolt that ended his
20-year rule in February 1986 and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.

   A man has claimed $17,600 that was found
last week along a parkway, police said.
   A woman found the bundle of $100 bills Thursday while walking
and turned it over to police, police Lt. Joseph Sumner said.
   ``The gentleman is very lucky, and the finder is very honest,''
Sumner said.
   Sumner refused to release the name of the man or the woman.
   The man lost the money Wednesday night and searched for it all
day Thursday, the lieutenant said. Then he heard a news report that
a bundle of money had been found, and he went to police to claim
it, Sumner said.
   Sumner said the man correctly identified the exact amount, its
denominations and that the cash was bound with a rubber band.
   Police also verified that the man had received $17,600 in cash
for business services, Sumner said.

   Cardinal John Dearden, considered one of
America's most influential Roman Catholic leaders for his role in
modernizing church doctrines, left behind accomplishments that will
stand for centuries, church officials said.
   Dearden died from pancreatic cancer Monday. He was 80.
   ``As time goes by, Dearden's place becomes even greater,'' said
the Rev. Richard McBrien, chairman of the theology department at
the University of Notre Dame. ``He was already perhaps the leading
Catholic bishop when he retired. In the last several years, his
reputation has only grown. He was a giant.''
   Dearden, who headed the Archdiocese of Detroit from 1959 to
1981, voted in the elections of two popes and played a major role
in the Second Vatican Council, which from 1962 to 1965 launched
extensive doctrine changes, including departure from the Latin
Mass, greater emphasis on laypersons' roles and fostering greater
unity among all Christians.
   ``His work will be remembered for a long time,'' said Michael
Ghering, director of communications for the Grand Rapids Diocese.
``I think the most important thing right now is for the faithful of
the diocese to join together and remember him in prayer.''
   Dearden decided to become a priest when he was 16. He joined the
priesthood in Cleveland in 1932 and was a bishop in Pittsburgh
before coming to Detroit, where he worked to combat discrimination
and develop programs to help inner-city blacks.
   While considered liberal by some members of the church, he was
known to others as ``Iron John'' for his strict adherence to
traditional church rules and discipline.
   Dearden officially retired as archbishop of the 1.2
million-member archdiocese in 1980 after suffering a heart attack.
He continued to administer the diocese until May 1981, when he was
succeeded by Edmund Szoka, who was elevated in June to cardinal.
   Dearden founded the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and
was its president from 1966 to 19871. The conference worked to
adopt Vatican II philosophies in the United States and currently
addresses social, political and economic issues within the context
of Christian principles.
   Pope Paul VI named Dearden a cardinal in 1969.
   Dearden will lie in state at the Blessed Sacrament Cathredral
until Friday, when burial is scheduled at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.

   An officer known as the oldest rookie in the force
died today of injuries from a shootout that left another man
mortally wounded, marking the fourth fatal attack on Dallas police
this year, authorities said.
   Officer Walter Williams, 47, was ambushed Monday night in the
parking lot of an apartment complex where he was investigating a
disturbance call, said Capt. John Holt.
   Williams, a five-year veteran of the department, was taken off
life support systems early today and died a few hours later, said
Lou Caudell, acting police chief. Two of the officer's three
children, his brother and his wife were at the hospital.
   Caudell said Williams joined the force in 1983 at age 42, making
him the oldest rookie. ``The younger guys called him `grandpa' and
stuff like that, but he liked it,'' Caudell said.
   A man whose name was being withheld was shot numerous times by
police and died at Parkland Memorial Hospital Monday night, Holt
said.
   Williams was answering a disturbance call at an apartment
complex when the shooting began about 10 p.m., Holt said. He and
his partner, officer Terry Caldwell, were talking to one of the
residents when they heard gunshots and went to investigate, Holt
said.
   They encountered a wounded woman on the way.
   ``One officer continued downstairs to investigate the
gunshots,'' he said. ``The second officer took the wounded woman
and placed her in apartment 206 where she would be safe and he
followed his partner downstairs.''
   But, as the second officer went downstairs, he heard more shots,
Holt said.
   ``As he got downstairs and rounded the corner he saw his partner
on the ground,'' the captain said.
   The second officer didn't see a suspect and called for
assistance.
   One of the assisting officers also was fired upon, Holt said.
   ``That man then charged the officers trying to get into the car
where the officer was going to get on the radio. The officers
returned fire _ a total of five officers returned fire _ he was
shot numerous times,'' Holt said.
   In January, off-duty Officer James Joe was killed while working
as a security guard at an apartment complex. Less than two weeks
later, Officer John Chase was shot to death by a homeless man who
police and witnesses said took his gun during a routine traffic
stop. And another officer was shot to death as he worked off-duty
at a grocery warehouse in west Dallas.
   Williams, who is from Elmore City, Okla., spent 20 years in the
military before entering police work.

<HEAD>Second Witness Links Hamadi to TWA Hijacking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second witness in the trial of
Mohammed Ali Hamadi has linked the defendant to the 1985 hijacking
of a TWA airliner to Beirut, according to evidence presented in
court today.
   Also today, court spokesman Falk Thomas told reporters that
pilots of the hijacked jet are scheduled to testify in September.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 1985
commandeering of TWA Flight 847 to the Lebanese capital. His trial
entered its fourth week today.
   Questioning witness Hazma Kassin, a Palestinian, Chief Judge
Heiner Mueckenberger read from a police report on Kassin's
recounting of a conversation with Hamadi's older brother, Abbas.
   Abbas was convicted in April of kidnapping two West Germans in
Beirut in an attempt to force West Germany to free his younger
brother.
   Quoting the police report, Mueckenberger told Kassim: ``You told
police, `Abbas told me that Mohammed was arrested because he was a
hijacker of the American airplane. Abbas said Mohammed is to be
extradited to the United States. Abbas didn't say how he knew about
this, but I assume that he had heard it from Mohammed.'''
   Kassim responded: ``It could be that I told that to the police.''
   ``Are you afraid to repeat it?'' Mueckenberger asked.
   ``No, but I can't remember now,'' Kassim said in the heavily
guarded Frankfurt courtroom.
   Kassim said he lived in Lebanon before coming to Germany in
1979. He now lives in the town of Merzig in Saarland state, near
the former residence of Abbas Hamadi.
   Mueckenberger said police questioned Kassim after Mohammed
Hamadi's arrest in January 1987, but did not specify the date.
   Last week Gaazi Yazbeck, a Lebanese man who lives in West
Germany and knows the two Hamadis, said that Abbas told him
Mohammed had ``something to do'' with the hijacking.
   ``He (Abbas) just said it, he was sort of bragging,'' Yazbeck
told the court. He said the conversation occurred at a bar in
Saarland state a few weeks after the hijacking.
   Mohammed Hamadi, who lived in West Germany from 1982 to 1984,
has not been asked directly about the hijacking.
   Flight 847 was seized after taking off from Athens on June 14,
1985, and diverted to Beirut. The gunmen killed U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem and held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days.
   Three other men who were allegedly involved in the hijacking
remain at large.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,
1987, after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his
luggage.
   In a brief exchange today, Mueckenberger asked Hamadi if he had
been sick. The defendant responded: ``I don't want to discuss this
in public.''
   Thomas later said Hamadi has been ill and requested hospital
treatment when the court recesses for four weeks on Aug. 9. He
declined to specify the nature of the illness.

   An outdoorsman says an encounter with a
seemingly friendly black bear that suddenly attacked him has taught
him a lesson.
   ``I guess I learned that I'm not as smart as I thought I was,''
Louis Gallian said Monday, nursing nine long scratches on the left
side of his face.
   ``I've spent an awful lot of time in the outdoors and know the
rules and I broke them. I made the mistake of feeding a wild bear.
I consider myself a little more educated now.''
   Gallian, 51, of Reno, got the scratches early Sunday when a 2-to
3-year-old bear took a swipe at him after the two had shared a
half-hour of eating, petting and ``generally good communication.''
   ``He was grunting at me and I was grunting back. We were having
a fairly good time, I thought,'' Gallian said. ``I was scratching
him behind his ears, patting his head and feeding him.''
   But when Gallian ran out of the bread and raw eggs he had been
giving the 4-foot-tall, 100- to 150-pound bear, the animal
apparently became frustrated, stood up and took a swing at Gallian.
   ``It startled me because I just didn't expect it at all,''
Gallian said. ``I shook my finger at him and yelled and he finally
ran off. I don't know what would have happened if I'd have run or
if his mother had been around.''
   Gallian, who had been camping alone, drove himself 10-15 miles
into Reno for emergency treatment. He did not require stiches.
   ``I think I'll have scars, though,'' Gallian said. ``I won't
forget this.''
   David Rice, spokesman for the state Wildlife Department, said it
was the first bear attack in Nevada that he knows of.
   ``The bear was provoked, so I'm not sure if it's really an
attack,'' Rice said. ``It's not like the bear saw a human and went
after it. But he did hurt Mr. Gallian and that's unusual around
here.''

   A new aid package for Nicaragua's Contra
rebels may include a plan to call Congress back into session during
its election recess if the leftist Managua government engages in
``some provocative act,'' Majority Leader Robert Byrd said today.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., said Senate Democrats continue to work on a new
aid package that will ``send a message to (Nicaraguan President
Daniel) Ortega that Congress supports the Arias peace plan,'' a
reference to the regional accord worked out by Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias.
   ``It is still my hope that we can develop a consensus that will
see Democrats unite'' on the aid package, Byrd said.
   Byrd said the plan likely will include a provision to bring
Congress back from its August recess should Ortega begin some new
offensive against the Contras.
   ``We will not forsake the Contras if he (Ortega) elects to
engage in some provocative act while Congress' back is turned,''
Byrd said.
   ``We're getting ready to go into a highly political period,''
said Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., who was among a dozen senators
scheduled to resume discussions today on the issue.
   ``I think it's important to get an agreed-on policy everyone can
live by until we get a new president,'' Boren said.
   The group was trying to find the magic combination of
humanitarian and military aid and the timing and conditions for its
release that could muster broad support among Senate Democrats as
well as among Republicans, and defuse the issue as a political
weapon.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he hoped an
aid package could be assembled by midweek, when it likely would be
attached to either a supplemental spending bill or a Defense
Department money bill.
   He said he then would take the Democratic plan to Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and seek a bipartisan
agreement. But he added: ``We're not quite there yet.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said a final aid plan ``might include
the opportunity for people to be able to have a vote (on military
aid) under some circumstances, at some point in time.''
   Kerry and other anti-Contra Democrats made clear, however, that
they wanted a high threshold for triggering any new arms shipments
to the rebels.
   Dole has proposed his own Contra aid package, which would send
$27 million in new humanitarian aid to the rebels after a current
humanitarian aid program ends Sept. 30.
   The Dole plan also would set aside $20 million for new weapons
for the rebels, but would release that money only if Congress
authorized it in a separate vote.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan
administration is encouraged that Democrats are working on an aid
proposal, and would cooperate ``to get an acceptable plan.''
   The congressional dilemma over how to treat Nicaragua has been
exacerbated in recent weeks by growing tensions in the region.
   The leftist Sandinista government has cracked down harshly on
internal opposition, arresting protesters and shutting down
dissenting media outlets. At the same time, the Contras have grown
more intransigent, installing a new, more hard-line political
directorate.
   Democrats were searching for an aid formula that would keep the
Contras alive as an opposition force and strengthen their hand in
negotiations with President Daniel Ortega's government, but would
not provoke renewed hostilities or be perceived as violating a
regional peace accord.
   Yet unanswered are questions of how much aid to provide, whether
it should include new weapons, who would have authority to order
resumption of any arms aid, what conditions would trigger the flow
of weapons and how the aid would be delivered.
   The Democrats also are seeking to defuse an issue that has
divided their conservative wing from the party majority. The issue
now divides presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, who opposes
Contra aid, from his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who
has supported it consistently.
   Although the Senate seemed likely to approve some sort of aid
package, prospects for House passage of anything including a
military component remained clouded.
   Speaker Jim Wright said the House would wait to see what
senators agree on before taking any action.
   ``I still tend to doubt there will be votes in the House to
resume the war,'' Wright said.

   The U.S. Armed Forces newspaper
today appealed to servicemen and their families to come forward
with information about a man suspected of being an East German spy.
   Investigators at the Bitburg Air Base, 13 miles from the
Luxembourg border, asked that the article appear in the Stars and
Stripes newspaper, said Larine Barr, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air
Force Office of Special Investigations.
   Ms. Barr said investigators believe the man, known as
``Mickei,'' no longer lives in the area and has fled to East
Germany.
   According to the brief article on the second page of Stars and
Stripes, Mickei worked as a taxi driver in the Bitburg area and
owned a camping trailer. ``The man often held weekend parties at
his trailer,'' Stars and Stripes said. It printed a telephone
number for people to call if they had any information.
   It said investigators are ``exploring the possibility that Air
Force members or members of their families had contact with the man
or have details about him.''

<TEXT>
   South Carolina's largest cash crop _
aromatic, golden tobacco leaf _ went to market today as the
staccato chant of auctioneers sounded on warehouse floors.
   This year's crop was expected to bring $160 million in revenues.
   ``Overall it's one of the best crops we've had in a long time,''
said Agriculture Commissioner Les Tindal as he surveyed piles of
tobacco at the growers Big 4 Warehouse.
   Warehouses here as well as in Mullins, Lake City and
Darlington-Timmonsville had opening-day auctions today. Auctions
will be held for the first time this year in Loris, Conway and
Kingstree on Wednesday.
   Observers predicted higher prices in South Carolina than last
year's opening day average of $138.58 per hundredweight. For the
1987 season, $151.6 million worth of tobacco was sold.
   Early prices at the Star-New Hope Warehouse outside Lake City
ranged from $124 to $148 per hundredweight. At Planter's Warehouse
in Lake City, some tobacco brought as much as $164.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell stopped by Planter's Warehouse, walking
along the rows of tobacco as the auctioneers and buyers followed
purchasing leaf.
   Later, Campbell criticized anti-smoking activists for attacking
the crop which he said pumps $300 million, with the ripple effect,
into the South Carolina economy.
   ``If some of these people who are screaming and yelling did as
much to fight illegal things _ if they shut down the marijuana
fields and eliminated the dope _ instead of going and trying to
beat down something that's legal and has been forever in the United
States this country would be a lot better off,'' he said.
   ``We've got a good quality crop,'' said DeWitt Gooden, a tobacco
specialist with the Clemson Extension Service. ``While weather
conditions haven't been ideal this season, recent rains have filled
out the tops of the crop.''
   There were strong opening day sales on Georgia-Florida markets
last week _ with prices averaging $136.59 per hundredweight. That's
up $8.70 from last year.
   Cooler weather than normal during the spring left this year's
crop about a week behind, Tindal said earlier. ``What we have to do
now is to convince the growers to leave their crop in the field
until it's fully mature,'' he said.
   While there are more acres of soybeans than any other crop
planted in the state, tobacco is stil king in sales, said Sonny
Smith of the South Carolina Agriculture Department.
   Tobacco brought in $156.1 million last year, and soybeans just
over $91 million.

<HEAD>Hospital Turns Away Burn Victims Because of Nurse Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two critically burned patients were turned away
from the only hospital in Denver with a special burn unit because
of a shortage of nurses.
   ``We are absolutely stretched to the limit,'' Sue Browning,
associate director of University Hospital, said Monday. ``We never
go on divert unless we are absolutely forced to do so.''
   Mark Bell, 17, with burns over 60 percent of his body, and
Clarence Kellogg, 76, with burns over 30 percent, were brought to
St. Anthony Hospital Central, which does not have a special burn
unit. St. Anthony officials tried unsuccessfully to get them
admitted to University's burn unit Monday.
   Bell, Kellogg and Mark Troudt, 25, suffered burns in an
explosion at Kellogg's home. A pilot light apparently ignited fumes
from a lacquer sealer the men were applying in the basement.
   Troudt suffered minor burns.
   Browning said staffing could not be arranged and even the most
serious emergencies are no exception under University Hospital's
new policy of diverting ambulances and patients. Only four of the
five beds in the burn unit were occupied.
   ``We don't have enough nurses to staff all the beds in the
hospital,'' Browning said. ``We are accepting every patient we can
possibly provide safe care for.''
   The two men remained at St. Anthony, officials said.

   Kidnappers of the wife of a
multimillionaire businessman have yet to tell him how much or where
to pay her ransom, even though only three days remain before their
deadline, officials said.
   ``There's been no contact,'' Wayne Taylor, special
agent-in-charge of the FBI in Mississippi, said Monday. ``We've got
leads, but no contact.''
   Taylor said a lack of communication was common in kidnapping
cases.
   FBI agents and police are investigating the disappearance of
Annie Laurie Hearin, 72. She was last seen by the family maid on
July 26.
   That day, Robert Hearin returned home and discovered a rambling,
typewritten letter and blood stains near the front door. The letter
said Hearin had wronged various groups and must pay several
individuals _ among them actor Vincent Price _ an unspecified
amount of money.
   If Hearin complied, his wife of 48 years would be returned after
10 days, the letter said.
   No further instructions arrived.
   Mrs. Hearin suffers an intestinal disorder known as ileitis, and
requires daily medication. Without medication, a person with the
condition would develop diarrhea and eventually could dehydrate and
die.
   Area churches have prayed for the safe return of Mrs. Hearin and
7-year-old Daffany Tullos, who also has been missing from her
Jackson home since July 26. Police say they don't believe the cases
are related.
   As president and chief executive officer of Mississippi Valley
Gas, Hearin's net worth is more than $100 million.

<HEAD>Nurses Join Service Workers In Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two thousand registered nurses walked off
their jobs today at six hospitals already trouble by a week-old
strike by 1,700 service workers.
   Negotiations betwen the hospitals and representatives of the
California Nurses Association ended just before midnight Monday,
and the strike began at 7 a.m., a CNA spokeswoman said.
   Karen Henry, chief negotiator for the hospitals, said her group
made a new proposal but ``CNA refused to even submit that economic
package to a vote.''
   The hospitals, she said, asked the association to submit the new
offer to a vote of its membership before Friday and to extend the
strike deadline until then. The new offer included an immediate 7
percent pay hike for all nurses, she said.
   However, Donna Hansen of the CNA said the offer was
``unacceptable'' and the hospitals were already 8 percent ``behind
other area hospitals in wage.''
   The nurses are seeking a 13 percent raise that would bring
salaries to $35,000 to $40,000 for day shifts. They are also
fighting hospital proposals for 12-hour shifts and demanding a 15
percent differential for night shifts.
   ``We think 12-hour shifts are unsafe as a general rule,'' said
Jessie Bostelle, director of collective bargaining for the CNA.
   The six Affiliated Hospitals transferred some intensive care
patients to other facilities Monday and planned to limit surgery to
emergencies.
   The average starting salary for a nurses working in the city for
Affiliated Hospitals is $30,072 to $37,692 for day shifts and
$34,583 to $43,346 for night shifts, according to a spokeswoman for
the hospitals.
   The nurses say that although those salaries are higher than the
nationwide average of about $28,000, they are lower than what 80
percent of the hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area pay.
   The strike was the first by registered nurses in the city since
1974.
   The six hospitals are Children's, Marshal Hale, Mount Zion, St.
Francis and St. Mary's in San Francisco and Seton Medical Center in
Daly City. Service workers struck those hospitals and one other a
week ago in a contract dispute.

<TEXT>
   The PLO said today it is calling a special
session of its parliament to discuss King Hussein decision to cut
Jordan's legal and administrative links with the Israeli-occupied
West Bank.
   Egypt, meanwhile, called for coordination between Jordan and the
Palestine Liberation Organization in efforts to achieve Middle East
peace.
   A statement issued in Cairo by Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Hussein's announcement Sunday did not mean Jordan
was abandoning its role in the quest for a Palestinian settlement.
   ``The advancement of the peace process ... requires a unified
Arab front based primarily on effective Jordanian-Palestinian
coordination,'' the statement said.
   The director of the PLO's Baghdad office, Azzam al-Ahmad, said
the organization's Central Council called for a meeting of the
400-plus member National Council within a month. The decision was
made during two days of meetings in Baghdad.
   The last National Council session, held in Algeria, came late
last year before the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The Central Council is the upper branch of the
bicameral National Council.
   On Monday, PLO foreign relations chief Farouk Kaddoumi called
during a closed Central Council meeting for the maintenance of
rights of Palestinians living in Jordan, PLO officials said on
condition they not be identified.
   King Hussein, in a televised speech, said he was cutting ties
with Palestinians in the West Bank because the PLO should be
primarily responsible for them.
   The PLO has been leading the uprising in Israel's occupied
lands. Most of the 850,000 Palestinians in the West Bank have
Jordanian passports, use Jordanian money and worship in
Jordanian-supported mosques.
   The Israelis do not recognize the PLO, but moderates among them
have expressed a willingness to talk peace with a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   On Saturday, Hussein dissolved Jordan's lower house of
parliament. Half of the 60 members of the Chamber of Deputies were
Palestinians from the West Bank. Three days earlier, he canceled a
$1.3 billion development project for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In his speech Sunday, the king said, ``Jordan is not Palestine.
The independent Palsetinian state will be established on occupied
Palestinian land after its liberation, God willing.''
   The PLO sources said Kaddoumi praised Jordan's ``distinguished''
relations with the world's 5 million Palestinians and the PLO and
said, ``These relations will remain.''
   They said Kaddoumi emphasized the importance of maintaining
``all the rights acquired by the Palestinian people in Jordan.''
   More than half of Jordan's residents are refugees or immigrants
from Palestine and there are fears Hussein's action could lead to a
loss of some of the rights they now have.
   PLO officials said PLO chief Yasser Arafat has ordered PLO
officials not to make any public comment on Hussein's action until
the Executive Committee, which serves as a Cabinet, can review the
possible consequences.
   They said Arafat had canceled a trip planned to the Jordanian
capital of Amman next week.
   Kaddoumi also was quoted by the PLO sources as saying support by
some Arab governments for the Palestinian uprising was ``below
required levels.''
   They said he accused Syria of undermining the insurrection by
sponsoring attacks by PLO dissident factions on Beirut refugee
camps held by Arafat loyalists.
   ``Syria's role in the attacks against Palestinian camps is clear
as the sun itself,'' Kaddoumi was quoted as saying.
   ``If they (the Syrians) are really after strategic parity (with
Israel), they should have dropped their anti-PLO policies,
especially during the uprising.''
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

   About 200 police applicants were
rejected after admitting they used illegal drugs or testing
positive for illegal drug use, a department spokesman said.
   A total of 640 people applied to become officers during a recent
recruitment drive.
   Urine tests showed that some applicants used cocaine, marijuana
or prescription drugs not issued to them, Chief John Pialorsi said
Monday. Others admitted during polygraph examinations they had used
illegal drugs.
   The urine samples were tested by the sheriff's office; the
results were verified by an independent laboratory.
   Sheriff Jim McMillan said he was not surprised. ``That shows you
just what we've been saying about the drug problem out there,'' he
said.
   But the sheriff said he does not think that drug use is a
problem among those who already wear police uniforms, although the
department does not test officers for drug use because of
constitutional questions.
   Testing of applicants is required by state law.

<TEXT>
   Arbitration and other methods of solving
legal disputes should be explored to save time and money for an
already overburdened judicial system, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist said today.
   State courts must lead the way, he told participants at the
annual Conference of Chief Justices.
   ``They have to be the pioneers in this,'' he said.
   Rehnquist called such alternatives to civil trials ``the wave of
the future.''
   However, Rehnquist said alternatives cannot be used in some
cases, such as those involving legal aid and complicated matters
such as the breakup of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co., but
can be a solution ``for the great body of cases.''
   Seventy to 90 percent of all civil cases are settled before
trial, said Carl F. Bianchi, administrative director of Idaho state
courts, but what is new is the ``enthusiastic packaging and
selling'' of alternatives.
   Bianchi said there are more than 800 alternative programs around
the country, ranging from state-financed programs to a canine court
in Los Angeles, which uses an animal trainer to solve disputes
between dog owners and plaintiffs.
   While half the nation's law schools offer courses in dispute
resolution, a Harvard Law School professor said he believed
attorneys will not encourage alternatives to trial because that
results in smaller fees.
   ``The pressure for change is going to come from judges and
courts and court administrators on the one hand, and from clients
on the other hand,'' said Frank E.A. Sander, who also is chairman
of the American Bar Associaton's Standing Committee on Dispute
Resolution.
   Rehnquist also told participants that a committee of the
Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by retired
Justice Louis Powell, has been appointed to look into the review
process of capital punishment cases.
   The committee will try to determine if the combined review
process of capital sentences in state and federal courts takes too
much time, and ``whether there's coherence and rationality'' in the
process, Rehnquist said.
   Rehnquist said the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 12 years ago that
capital punishment was constitutional and that he believes courts
should not stop executions.
   The highest judge or justice in each of the 50 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American
Samoa and Guam were invited to attend the five-day conference.

<TEXT>
   More than half the city's 83 private and
municipal hospitals have been sending infectious waste out with
regular garbage, city officials confirmed today.
   The Environmental Control Board has fined 50 hospitals a
combined $481,000 from November 1985 to May of this year for the
illegal practice, the Sanitation Department said, confirming a
report in today's New York Post.
   ``This has been a problem for a long, long time,'' said Andrew
McCarthy, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation. ``It's getting attention now because of the beach
problems.''
   Hospitals that have been fined lose their city pickup service
for as long as six months, forcing them to use more expensive
private carriers, said Vito Turso, spokesman for the Sanitation
Department.
   None of the 40 state-licensed, private infectious-waste carriers
are monitored by the Sanitation Department.
   Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said last week that his
office is investigating whether ``criminality in the carting
industry'' may be partly to blame for the medical waste that has
been washing ashore this summer, forcing the closure of beaches in
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
   City law requires that infectious hospital waste be
``red-bagged'' _ separated from general waste and removed out of
state or incinerated under controlled conditions at a temperature
of at least 2,000 degrees.

Counts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today asked a judge to consider
severing the main Iran-Contra conspiracy counts from Oliver L.
North's case and try the former White House aide on obstruction,
false statements and tax-fraud charges.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh asked U.S. District Judge
Gerhard Gesell to put off trial of the three main charges of the
Iran-Contra indictment if he refuses to relax an Aug. 1 deadline
for producing a host of secret documents to the defense.
   If the first three counts are severed from the indictment, ``the
intelligence agencies can continue the process of collecting and
analyzing their documents to assure completion of any additional
discovery ordered by the court,'' while North is tried on the other
charges, Walsh said in a court filing.
   In turning over a number of documents on Monday for North's
inspection, the government made ``a reasonable, good-faith effort
to comply with the court's order,'' Walsh said. But the government
agencies need more time to find the documents covered by the
judge's order, the prosecutor said.
   Failure to comply fully with the order should not result in
dismissal of the first three counts of the indictment, Walsh said.
North should be ordered to make a more specific request for
documents he wants to see, the prosecutor added.
   Walsh said the 13 charges that North lied to Congress, shredded
documents, illegally enriched himself and committed tax fraud to
raise money for the Contras are ready to be tried on Sept. 20 as
originally scheduled by the judge.
   ``The criminal conduct alleged in these counts is discrete, and
the allegations, far from involving novel legal theories, are
routine,'' the prosecutor said.
   The charges, which include allegations that North illegally
accepted the installation of a $13,000 security fence outside his
home and pocketed $4,300 in travelers checks from the Contras,
don't involve a wide range of classified documents, Walsh said.
   But unless Gesell gives the government more time to produce
secret documents to the defense, Walsh said, the main charges
against North could not be tried next month.
   Those three counts charge that North conspired with former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to
illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   In addition to the conspiracy charge, the four defendants are
all charged with wire fraud and theft of government property.
   The three charges constitute what Walsh has previously
characterized as the main part of the case against North and his
three co-defendants, who will be tried separately.
   Gesell ordered the government to produce a large quantity of
secret documents to the defense that he ruled would help North
establish that he acted with approval of higher authorities.
   In a filing last week, prosecutors asked that Gesell extend the
Aug. 1 deadline for production of those documents, noting that the
CIA and other government agencies had opposed public disclosure of
many of the documents.
   ``Much of the information called for by the court's July 8 order
can never be disclosed publicly. The need to search it out,
nevertheless, now threatens to derail the schedule for trial set
down by the court,'' Walsh said in his pleading last week.
   North, meanwhile, has asked Gesell to postpone the trial until
next March, saying his defense team needs more time to study the
thousands of pages of documents already turned over by Walsh.
   The defense also contends that trying the case during this
fall's presidential campaign would make it impossible to obtain an
impartial jury verdict.
   At a hearing last week, Gesell threatened to dismiss the first
three counts of the indictment unless the government turns over the
secret documents North needs to defend the charges.
   In a recent letter to Walsh, the CIA said that it was willing to
let North inspect most of the documents covered by his request but
the agency would not allow their declassification for use at a
public trial.
   Walsh conceded in today's filing that ``the problems of public
disclosure are formidable and the outlook discouraging.'' But he
urged the judge to give him a chance to show the documents wouldn't
further a defense that North acted with approval of higher
officials in the Reagan administration.
   The prosecutor said he can prove that ``no authorized covert
actions identified in North's supplemental discovery request were
sufficiently similar to the conduct charged in the indictment to
lead North to believe that that conduct would be proper.''
   Walsh said he knew ``of no analogue for the diversion (of
arms-sale funds) charged in the indictment.''

   The parole board announced today it has denied
parole for Wayne Carl Coleman, originally sentenced to die for his
part in the 1973 slayings of six members of a family but sentenced
to life in prison following a retrial.
   The decision by the Board of Pardons and Paroles, reached July
22, also said the panel would not review Coleman's case again for
eight years _ in July 1996.
   Coleman was one of three men originally convicted of murder and
sentenced to death for the May 14, 1973, slayings of six members of
the Ned Alday family. A federal appeals court ordered them retried
in 1985.
   Coleman and George Elder Dungee both received life sentences
this year. Carl Isaacs, alleged to be the mastermind, was again
sentenced to death.
   Parole board spokesman Silas Moore said Coleman's case came up
for an automatic review by the board when the retrial jury imposed
a life sentence. Coleman has already served 15 years in prison, and
prisoners are eligible for parole consideration after seven years.
   Policy allows the board to set future review dates from one to
eight years in the future.
   Coleman was notified of the action in a letter dated July 22.
Moore said the decision was not announced until today because most
of the board's administrative officers were at a seminar away from
the Capitol last week.

   National car rental companies and
regional companies squared off over fees for fuel and mileage and
collision damage waivers at a conference intended to draft consumer
guidelines for the industry.
   Testimony by representatives of the car rental companies opened
a four-day meeting of attorneys general from 17 states. A National
Association of Attorneys General task force is hearing car rental
officials respond to a preliminary report aimed at eliminating
misleading and confusing advertising and marketing policies.
   Regional companies, such as Alamo and General, advertise low
daily rates with no additional charge for mileage. However, larger
companies, such as Hertz, complained that those companies don't
always advertise other charges, such as up-front fuel costs and
airport fees.
   Alamo and General responded Monday that Hertz and other
companies haven't always advertised actual costs to consumers,
particularly those who exceed mileage limits.
   They contended that driving hundreds of miles above the limits
could triple the advertised rate and that some of the larger
companies charged a service fee of up to 1.75 times the local pump
price to refill tanks with fuel.
   The companies were also divided on collision damage waivers, an
optional charge that waives a customer's liability if the rental
car is damaged.
   Hertz, Thrifty, Budget and the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners all support laws eliminating the waiver, saying that
most consumers have auto insurance that covers rental car accidents.
   General and Alamo oppose attempts to eliminate collision damage
waivers.
   Representatives of several rental companies said they generally
support efforts to force their competitors to disclose more in
their advertising, as long as they all must do it.
   ``Partial disclosure is more deceptive than no disclosure at
all,'' said William E. Lobeck Jr., president of Thrifty Car Rental
of Tulsa, Okla.
   Kansas Attorney General Bob Stephan is the chairman of the task
force. Final recommendations will be presented to the association
at its national meeting in December.

   A suspected land mine blew up
an army Land Rover in the County Tyrone village of Carland this
morning, slightly injuring six part-time soldiers, police said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for
the attack in a message to news organizations.
   On Monday, an IRA bomb ripped through a British army barracks in
north London, killing one soldier and injuring nine.
   After this morning's attack, the soldiers struggled out of the
Land Rover and guerrillas lying in ambush opened fire with machine
guns. Soldiers in the vehicle that was attacked or in another
nearby army Land Rover returned fire, a police spokesman said. The
guerrillas escaped.
   Police said the six members of the locally recruited Ulster
Defense Regiment were treated for minor injuries at South Tyrone
Hospital in Dungannon and released. One suffered a broken arm.
   The police spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the
explosion occurred at 9:30 a.m. on the Cookstown Road in Carland, 4
miles from Dungannon and about 35 miles west of Belfast, where at
least two army Land Rovers were on patrol.
   The area was sealed off and security forces were investigating,
the spokesman said.
   Last month near Coalisland, a few miles away, security forces
found an 800-pound bomb abandoned by the IRA because cattle had
eaten through the command wires.

<TEXT>
   A state trooper was in custody today after a
drug-sniffing dog found six kilograms of cocaine in her rental car,
an FBI spokesman said.
   Jacqueline Denise Robinson, 27, of Miami, was already under
surveillance by the Florida Highway Patrol and FBI and was spotted
receiving a package from a man at the Florida Turnpike's Pompano
Beach rest station Monday afternoon, said FBI spokesman Joe Del
Campo.
   She then headed north on the Turnpike, but her rental car broke
down and an trooper with a drug-sniffing dog named Ulf stopped to
help.
   Ms. Robinson flashed her FHP identification, but the dog smelled
drugs, and a search of the car turned up six kilograms of cocaine,
said Del Campo.
   The arrest was coincidental to the investigation, said the
agent. He said he had no information on the man who allegedly
handed her the package.
   Ms. Robinson, who had been on the force for a year, was
suspended at the scene by FHP Commander Col. Bobby Burkett, said
Del Campo, and was taken to the Dade County Jail.
   She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute, and if convicted faces a minimum mandatory sentence of
10 years up to a life term, and a possible fine of $4 million.

   Cellist Andre Navarra, known for his performances
ranging from Bach to contemporary music, has died of a heart attack
at the age of 77.
   Navarra, considered one of the virtuosos of the French School,
died Sunday at a hotel in Siena, Italy, said a spokesman for the
Accademia Chigiana della Musica.
   A professor at the Conservatoire de Paris, Navarra had taught
advanced music courses at Chigiana since 1954.
   The French state-run classical music radio network
France-Musique said it would broadcast a special program Thursday
on Navarra, including homages from other musicians and several of
his best-known recordings.

<TEXT>
   A law under consideration would grant a
proper funeral to executed leaders of the 1956 anti-Communist
uprising, as well as their reburial in marked graves, according to
a weekly publication.
   Gyula Borics, state secretary in the Ministry of Justice, told
the weekly Oetlet that under a 1979 decree, a regulation was
revoked regarding the burial in unmarked graves of people who have
been sentenced to death and executed.
   The law apparently never was made retroactive, however.
   ``Now owing to the humanitarian considerations, a ruling might
be adopted that a proper funeral may take place of the persons ...
executed because of their role in 1956,'' the weekly quoted Borics
as saying in its Aug. 4 edition.
   There has been increasing debate in Hungary over whether or not
to reevaluate the events of 1956 and calls for the rehabilitation
of Imre Nagy, Hungary's leader at the time, and others executed
following the revolt. They are buried in unmarked graves.
   Premier and Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz has rejected any
revision of Hungary's assessment of 1956 as
``counterrevolutionary,'' but has said there would be a review of
how it came about.
   Some people were said to have been injured when police broke up
a June 16 demonstration to commemorate the 30th anniversary of
Nagy's execution when people called for his rehabilitation, but a
memorial service earlier that day at the cemetery where he is
believed to be buried was not interrupted.
   Last week, a Justice Ministry official announced that people
sentenced for their part in 1956 would be eligible to apply for an
invalidation of their criminal record.

<TEXT>
   A probe into possibly illegal trading based on
leaked Business Week stock tips has prompted the firing of one
printing worker and suspension of another, the first non-Wall
Street casualties in the scandal.
   R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. of Chicago announced the disciplinary
actions Monday and said it was continuing to investigate whether
other members of its staff helped purloin ``Inside Wall Street''
columns to share with stockbrokers.
   Donnelley spokesman James M. Ratcliffe said the fired production
employee, who had worked at the company's printing plant in Old
Saybrook, Conn., admitted furnishing advance copies of the columns
to William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch broker in nearby New
London who was fired last week.
   Ratcliffe also said the company suspended a worker in its
Torrance, Calif., plant after cooperating with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., which fired broker Brian Callahan from its branch
in nearby Anaheim on Friday.
   The Donnelley spokesman declined to identify either employee.
Officials reached by telephone at both plants referred all queries
to Ratcliffe.
   ``What has happened is an object lesson to employees,''
Ratcliffe said. ``We simply have to reiterate on the plant-wide
level and department by department that this is not to be done.''
   Asked if he expected more dismissals or suspensions, Ratcliffe
said, ``I have no reason to think there's another one imminent.''
   The printing company's action marked the first time since the
burgeoning scandal surfaced late last month that individuals
outside the investment business were disciplined.
   In addition, five more investment firms have acknowledged they
are investigating trading activity surrounding the columns prior to
their publication. That raised the total number of firms disclosing
their investigations to at least nine, amid reports that more than
two dozen firms were under scrutiny, and increased the likelihood
that the scandal is more widespread than earlier believed.
   Mary McGeachy, public relations director for Business Week,
declined to comment on the Donnelley actions, calling them a matter
between the company and its employees. Securities and Exchange
Commission officials also declined to comment in accordance with
agency policy regarding current investigations.
   Leaking and using market-sensitive information for trading in
securities before it becomes public knowledge is loosely referred
to as insider trading and is a form of fraud under federal law.
   Business Week acknowledged on July 21 that it long had suspected
leaks of tips in its ``Inside Wall Street'' column, which regularly
touts little-known stocks as good buys.
   Besides Merrill Lynch and Prudential-Bache, the Hartford, Conn.,
brokerage Advest Inc. has suspended one broker, and Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. says three former brokers from the Hartford branch of
E.F. Hutton Group Inc. also may have been involved before Shearson
acquired Hutton earlier this year.
   Late Monday, PaineWebber Inc. spokeswoman Mary Anne Myers said
it recently had hired at least two of those former brokers, who are
now the subject of an internal investigation. She wouldn't disclose
their identities or provide further details.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. confirmed today it also was
investigating suspicious trading in Business Week-related stocks at
one of its California offices and had alerted the SEC.
   In addition, the discount brokerages Quick & Reilly Group Inc.
and Charles Schwab & Co. acknowledged Monday they were conducting
internal queries into Business Week-related trading through some of
their accounts and were cooperating with SEC requests for
information.
   Integrated Resources Inc., a diversified financial services firm
headquartered in New York, said its lawyers also were investigating
a possible link to the scandal. Spokesman David Fluhrer said the
query began in response to a report in The Wall Street Journal that
the firm was possibly involved.

   U.S. jet fighters streaked
across rainy skies to strafe a hill in northeastern Thailand on
Tuesday, as U.S. and Thai forces climaxed war games aimed at
repelling a supposed invasion of Thailand.
   The half-dozen F-16 fighters were joined by helicopters, armored
personnel carriers and tanks in the assault on the hill in Nakhorn
Ratchasima, 140 miles from Bangkok.
   The exercise is the seventh of an annual series dubbed ``Cobra
Gold,'' and this year involves 15,000 troops.
   The exercise began last month, and on July 23, 400 Thai and
American marines assaulted a beach in Cholburi province about 80
miles south of Bangkok.
   The radio station of the Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia has condemned the games as ``hostile acts.''
   Thailand considers the 9{-year-old Vietnamese occupation of
Cambodia its top security threat. To bolster its defense
capabilities, Thailand recently took delivery of a squadron of
F-16s bought from the United States, its key Western ally.

   The audience at an opening performance by the
Kirov ballet booed and hissed because the show was delayed for an
hour by workers still installing seats in the temporary theater.
   The final checks of the house ``ran a bit longer than
expected,'' said Zoe Coles, spokeswoman at the Business Design
Center in north London.
   She said the center had installed 3,200 seats in six days,
transforming the exhibition and conference center into a theater
the size of the Kirov's Mariinsky theater in Leningrad.
   The week-long appearance by the Kirov performing ``Giselle'' at
the Business Design Center is the second of the Kirov's
three-theater London tour.
   Last week the company performed ``Giselle'' at the London
Coliseum, home of the English National Opera, and next week will
dance ``Le Corsaire'' at Covent Garden.
   Ms. Coles said that using the Business Design Center meant more
people could come because of cheaper tickets. Tickets to the
Business Design Center performance cost from $14.50 to $60,
compared with $76 to $119 at Covent Garden.

<HEAD>PEN President Says Writers Won Victory Against Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Polish PEN Writer's
club, banned by the government five years ago, said Tuesday that
official permission to resume the group's activities was won
without concessions.
   ``We have won a victory,'' said Juliusz Zulawski, who was the
club's president when the group ran afoul of communist authorities
in the early 1980s.
   ``It is very important because this happened without any
concessions on our part,'' Zulawski told The Associated Press in an
interview.
   Minister of Culture Aleksander Krawczuk gave Zulawski, 77, a
letter Monday from the mayor of Warsaw authorizing the writer to
hold new elections for the club's leadership.
   ``There were no political conditions. There will be free
elections (of new club officers), probably this September,'' he
said.
   The government suspended the club's activities in 1981 when
martial law was imposed and banned it in 1983, charging it had been
taken over by anti-government and anti-socialist elements.
   Since the club was banned, its offices and official charter have
been overseen by a government commision.
   ``The commission was removed yesterday and I have full access to
our office,'' Zulawski said.
   He declined to speculate on why the government had decided to
recognize the group again, adding that its membership has remained
the same.
   A softening in the government position was signaled in June,
when an official newspaper printed a letter from 150 writers and
intellectuals demanding the club's reactivization.
   After the government banned the club, its members and the
international PEN Organization refused to recognize the new
commission.
   Zulawski said the international group will recognize the
reformed club and its leaders.
   He said the future of the club is far from certain.
   ``It is impossible to predict whether the government will
interfere again,'' he said. ``No one knows what will happen.''

<HEAD>Federal Agencies Directed to Implement Guidelines Barring AIDS
Discrimination</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 3 grafs, Rep. Henry Waxman, with reaction.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today directed all federal
agencies to implement guidelines that bar discrimination against
employees infected with the AIDS virus, but declined to back his
AIDS commission's call for federal anti-discrimination legislation.
   That recommendation, delivered to the White House by the AIDS
panel in June, was referred to the attorney general for study.
   Meanwhile, Reagan said private and non-federal groups should
consider adopting similar policies.
   ``I ask American businesses, unions and schools to examine and
consider adopting education and personnel policies based on the OPM
(Office of Personnel Management) and Centers for Disease Control
guidelines,'' Reagan said in a statement.
   Calling AIDS a ``public health threat that has touched the lives
of Americans with alarming speed and frightening consequences,''
Reagan issued what he called a 10-point action plan.
   ``These directives will assure compassion toward those with the
HIV infection, provide dignity and kindness in treatment and
medical care, and require that we inform and educate our citizens
to prevent further spread of the disease,'' Reagan said.
   He did not appear at a White House briefing where the plan was
presented by aides. Moments later, he spoke at a ceremony in the
White House complex honoring senior federal employees.
   The official White House response to the AIDS commission's 597
recommendations was coordinated by Dr. Donald Ian Macdonald, a
special presidential assistant and director of the Drug Abuse
Policy Office.
   Defending the administration's refusal to support the AIDS
commission's call for federal anti-discrimination legislation,
Macdonald told reporters that 36 states already have similar laws.
   Moreover, he said discrimination ``is not a problem'' in New
York, Los Angeles or San Francisco, cities with the largest
populations of people with AIDS.
   Macdonald maintained that by calling for government-wide
application of OPM guidelines for federal workers, ``the president
clearly puts himself out front'' in crusading against
discrimination aimed at people with the AIDS virus, or HIV.
   Although a little over 65,000 people in the United States have
been diagnosed with full-blown AIDS, federal estimates put the
number infected with the virus at between 1 million and 1.5 million.
   Scientists are increasingly coming to the conclusion that most
if not all of those infected with the virus eventually will succumb
to the disease and die unless a cure is found. No one has been
known to have recovered from the disease.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins, the AIDS commission
chairman, had characterized the panel's call for
anti-discrimination legislation as the keystone for all its other
recommendations.
   At a breakfast meeting with reporters in advance of the White
House release, Macdonald acknowledged Watkins was not likely to be
pleased with the administration's failure to heed that call.
   Watkins was out of the country and could not be reached.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., reacted angrily to the White House
announcement, saying Reagan was ``stalling'' on the issue and
ignoring his own commission's key recommendations.
   ``Why are they stalling?'' Waxman said in a statement. ``This
administration has done its best to avoid making even a single
helpful AIDS decision in the eight years of the Reagan presidency.
They hand-pick a commission, and then don't even have the courage
to accept its recommendations.''
   Added Waxman, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
health subcommittee: ``We don't need another study. What we need is
leadership, and while Dr. (C. Everett) Koop (the surgeon general)
and Admiral Watkins have given that, once again the president is
hiding.''

<DATELINE>KUBINKA AIR FORCE BASE, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci boarded the Kremlin's new secret bomber and watched
war games on tours Tuesday of two bases that had been off-limits to
Westerners.
   The visits to Kubinka, including the bomber NATO calls the
Blackjack, and to an army artillery division were unprecedented for
an American official, Carlucci said later, but did not persuade him
that the Soviets had made moved from an offensive to defensive
military posture.
   ``We, for example, have seen no change in force structure nor
have we seen any change in the resources going into the Soviet
military establishment,'' he told a news conference back in Moscow.
The Pentagon chief said he would continue seeking a 2 percent
increase after inflation in the U.S. military budget.
   During his visit to the air base 31 miles west of Moscow,
Carlucci spent about 10 minutes in the cockpit of the long-range
Blackjack bomber. Foreigners had seen it previously only in
drawings and reconnaissance photographs.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the Soviet military chief of
staff, inspected a B-1 bomber last month at Ellsworth Air Force
Base outside Rapid City, S.D.
   Soviet military officials were much more forthcoming to Carlucci
than to foreign journalists about the sleek white plane with a
sharply pointed nose.
   They kept reporters and photographers behind a rope barrier
about 50 yards from the plane and refused to tell them anything
about it.
   ``Why do you want to know about the bomber? Why frighten
people?'' asked Carlucci's host, Col. Gen. Boris F. Korolkov.
   Korolkov, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet air
force, refused to identify the aircraft, whose only markings were a
red star and a number 12 on the tail.
   Soviet Military Power, the Pentagon reference book, says the
four-engine bomber is the world's heaviest and largest but does not
give dimensions.
   Jane's All The World's Aircraft, a respected British
publication, says the plane is known in the Soviet Union as the
Tupolev strategic bomber, is 177 feet long, has a wingspan of 182
feet and weighs 275 tons.
   The plane has been under development for 10 years, can fly at
twice the speed of sound, has a range of 4,500 miles, and can carry
bombs and cruise missiles, according to Jane's.
   It and the U.S. Defense Department had predicted Blackjacks
would be deployed this year. Korolkov said they became operational
``recently.''
   Carlucci inspected a MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter first, then turned
to the nearby bomber. As he did so, two Blackjacks emerged from
patchy clouds and roared by.
   The American visitor inspected the Blackjack's underbelly, then
climbed orange stairs through the open bomb-bay doors and entered
the cockpit.
   He told reporters later he could not reveal technical details of
the aircraft but compared it to the B-1 in the ability to fly at
low altitudes and carry large payloads.
   ``I'm not a qualified intelligence officer,'' said Carlucci, a
former senior CIA official. ``I'm not a qualified observer. They
let me sit in the cockpit but I couldn't tell one instrument from
another.''
   He said his four-day visit to the Soviet Union, which began
Monday, is largely symbolic, ``a way of continuing the dialogue
between our two military establishments.''
   At Kubinka, Carlucci also inspected an Ilyushin-78 tanker plane
and Mi-26 helicopter, and watched a display of aerobatics by four
MiG-29s.
   Carlucci then traveled 12 miles southwest to the headquarters of
the Taman Motorized Rifle Division to watch war games. Defense
Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, Carlucci's host, stood next to him on a
two-story building overlooking a huge field of mock battle.
   Mi-24 helicopters flew past the building with guns firing.
Artillery blasted targets in the field.
   Infantry vehicles bounced over terrain pocked with shell craters
and Yazov joked to Carlucci: ``It's not very comfortable to drive.''
   Another guest was the defense minister's 10-year-old grandson,
Oleg Losik. He rode around the Taman base on his 64-year-old
grandfather's lap, next to Carlucci in the back seat of a black
limousine.
   When the games were over Carlucci asked Oleg if he wanted to
shoot like the soldiers, but the boy appeared too shy to answer.
   Oleg told a reporter later, wearing an oversized military
officer's jacket to keep warm, that the war games were ``very
interesting'' and only the second he'd seen.
   On Carlucci's schedule for Wednesday is a visit to Black Sea
fleet headquarters on the Crimean Peninsula.

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court today reversed one
conviction of the youngest murderer sentenced to die under New
Jersey's 6-year-old capital punishment law, but ordered him
resentenced _ possibly to death _ for a second slaying.
   The court ruled that Marko Bey's constitutional rights were
violated when police persisted in questioning him about the slaying
of 19-year-old Cheryl Alston of Asbury Park, despite his wish to
remain silent.
   Because of the improper interrogation, the court ruled, Bey's
confession to beating and strangling Miss Alston with her bra
should not have been admitted into evidence. The court reversed the
conviction and sent the case back to the lower court for a new
trial.
   The court also ruled that Bey, who was 17 at the time of the
Alston slaying, should not have been subject to the death penalty
because he was a minor. After the murders, the Legislature modified
the death penalty so convicted murderers cannot receive a death
sentence if they are under 18 at the time of the homicide.
   But Bey remains exposed to a possible death sentence for the
murder of Carol Peniston, 46, of Asbury Park. Bey turned 18 less
than two weeks after Miss Alston died on April 2, 1983, and about
two weeks before murdering Mrs. Peniston.
   Although the court ruled the conviction for Mrs. Peniston's
murder should stand, it reversed Bey's death sentence for that
killing because of a trial error. But the court ordered him
resentenced and said he could again receive the death penalty.
   ``We're real pleased that the conviction was reversed in the
Alston case. We would have been more pleased had the conviction
been reversed in Peniston as well,'' said Bey's attorney, Judith
Borman.
   Citing a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, the state
court ruled that instructions given the jury could have prompted
them unfairly to dismiss factors about Bey that may have caused
them to be more lenient.
   In death penalty cases, juries first decide the guilt or
innocence of the defendant. If guilty, a sentencing phase is held
during which defense lawyers present evidence of mitigating factors
to support sparing the defendant's life, while prosecutors present
aggravating factors that would warrant a death sentence.
   The court ruled that in the sentencing phase of the case
involving Mrs. Peniston's death, the judge improperly told the jury
it must agree unanimously if it is to consider a mitigating factor.
   Bey is one of 29 people on death row in Trenton State Prison. He
was the youngest inmate on death row until the conviction of Philip
Dixon, 21, last year of sexually assaulting, stabbing with a
railroad spike and then drowning a 13-year-old girl.

   A federal judge found the city of Yonkers in
contempt of court today because the City Council failed to pass a
housing desegregation resolution.
   Calling Yonkers ``a national symbol of defiance to civil
rights,'' U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand imposed a fine of $100 a
day, doubling daily, to begin today. The fine would surpass the
city's $337 million operating budget by the 23rd day.
   The Yonkers City Council voted Monday night against endorsing a
court-ordered desegregation plan for 800 units of affordable
housing to be built by private developers throughout the city north
of New York City.
   Three of four council members who voted against the resolution
also were found in contempt today and fined $500 per day, beginning
today. The fourth, Vice Mayor Henry Spallone, was given at least a
one-day adjournment to hire a lawyer.
   ``The city of Yonkers is in contempt because it chooses to be in
contempt,'' Sand said after a one-hour hearing in federal court in
Manhattan. ``It does not find itself inadvertently in that
position.''
   An attorney representing the city, Michael Sculnick, had argued
against the contempt ruling, saying, ``Fines of that magnitude are
devastating and will bankrupt the city in three weeks.''
   Earlier, Yonkers Mayor Nicholas Wasiscko had said he hoped the
judge would see ``good faith'' in the closeness of the 4-3 vote and
delay the fines.
   Wasiscko, who voted for the desegregation plan, said he would
call for another council meeting this week to reconsider the issue.
   Sand insisted the fines were ``remedial, not punitive,'' because
they would end if the council changed its vote. Sand has said that
if the defiant council members remained in contempt until Aug. 10,
they would face prison.
   Monday's vote came after a raucous hourlong meeting highlighted
by shouts and jeers from the 150 people in the chambers and about
300 outside. One person was arrested for disorderly conduct and one
person was ejected from the meeting.
   In 1980, the U.S. Justice Department charged that Yonkers, a
city of 195,000 people, had intentionally segregated its housing
and schools for 40 years.
   The east side of the state's fourth-largest city is
predominately white, middle to upper class. It borders the wealthy
towns of Scarsdale and Bronxville. The west side is older, more
industrial, and mostly black and Hispanic. It adjoins New York
City's poorest borough, the Bronx.
   In 1985, Sand found Yonkers liable. It was the first time school
and housing segregation were linked.
   The city's Board of Education began an integration plan in 1986.
That year, Sand ordered the city to build 200 units of low-income
housing on the east side and 800 others throughout the city _ 160
low-income homes, the rest for moderate incomes.
   Sand ordered the council to pass a resolution by Monday
supporting the plan. It could not pass the actual plan because it
must first hold a state-mandated public hearing before voting on a
zoning matter.
   The council has wavered in the face of public opinion.
   Spallone, the judge's most vociferous critic, demanded an
investigation into the city's low-income housing and into Sand's
law practice. Spallone charged that Sand was violating state law by
forcing the vote before the public hearing.
   ``The judge feels above the law,'' he told a cheering crowd.
``This judge can no longer address this case.''
   Council member Peter Chema said it was not ``solely a black and
white issue, but a green issue'' that involves real estate
development.
   Chema said Sand, who lives in the exclusive Westchester enclave
of Pound Ridge, was being ``autocratic not democratic.''
   Council member Nicholas Longo called Sand's actions ``a typical
case of the hypocrisy of the rich and elitist looking down upon
those who must work for everything they have.''
   While six of the seven council members, including Wasiscko,
campaigned last November on opposing Sand, the council agreed to a
consent decree in January after Sand threatened to fine the city
into bankruptcy.
   But residents vehemently against the decree began showing up in
force at council meetings, sent bullets in the mail to the
councilmembers and picketed Sand's Manhattan and Pound Ridge homes,
causing some of the councilmembers to backtrack.
   Even the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to hear the city's appeal
hasn't daunted opponents of the housing.
   Sand proposed creating an independent commission to build the
housing to circumvent city politicians.
   But the Justice Department argued that a commission would be
``effectively letting the city off the hook once again'' and would
allow the city to ``flout with impunity'' the court order.

   More than 1.3 million students earned
Presidential Academic Fitness Awards this year, the Department of
Education said Tuesday.
   The winners finished elementary, junior high or high school with
grade averages of B-plus or better and achievement test scores in
the top 20 percent on standardized tests.
   The program rules also allow principals to present awards to a
limited number of students who demonstrated extraordinary effort
but did not meet all the criteria.
   Each of the 1,315,081 winners, from 47,166 public and private
schools, are receiving a certificate signed by President Reagan,
Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and the school principal.
   The recognition program, in its fifth year, is modeled after the
presidential physical fitness awards.

<HEAD>South Africa Offers To Begin Withdrawing From South-West Africa On
Nov. 1</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   South Africa has offered to
begin withdrawing its troops from South-West Africa on Nov. 1,
Foreign Minister Pik Botha said today.
   Botha said South Africa made the offer today in Geneva during a
new round of peace talks on southern Africa. The talks involve
South Africa, Angola, Cuba and U.S. mediators.
   Botha also said the South African proposal calls for elections
in South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, on June 1 next year.
   ``It follows that the total withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola will be completed by June 1, 1989,'' Botha said.
   An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops now are in Angola supporting
the country's Marxist government.
   Botha said the South Africans want a cease-fire in the
13-year-old Angolan war to go into effect Aug. 10.
   Botha said this would give United Nations almost three months to
prepare for the implementation of U.N. Resolution 435, which calls
for South Africa to grant independence to Namibia.
   South Africa and the United States support the rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in
their fight against the Angolan government. An estimated 3,000
South African troops are in southern Angola fighting alongside
UNITA.
   Botha gave no indication how the Cubans and Angolans have
responded to the South African offer.
   However, the offer is the first time South Africa has offered a
specific date for the implementation of Resolution 435.
   South Africa, backed by the United States, has insisted that
independence for Namibia must be linked with a Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola.
   Cuba and Angola have said that such a withdrawal could take up
to four years, while the South Africans and the United States are
seeking a much shorter timetable.
   South Africa's mandate over South-West Africa was terminated by
the United Nations in 1966. But in defiance of several U.N.
Security Council resolutions, it has retained control of the
country, which possesses considerable mineral wealth.

   U.S.-mediated talks on peace in southern Africa
opened here today, and South Africa's foreign minister said his
country offered to withdraw troops from South-West Africa starting
Nov. 1.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said in Johannesburg that the
proposal also called for elections in South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia, on June 1 next year.
   ``It follows that the total withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola will be completed by June 1, 1989,'' Botha said.
   The talks, the fifth round of closed-door negotiations that
started in May in London, are being held in Geneva's bunker-like
International Conference Center. The U.S. team and the joint
Angolan-Cuban delegation arrived ahead of the South Africans.
   A U.S. spokesman, Art Skop, said U.S. officials would maintain a
news embargo until a news conference planned by Chester Crocker,
the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, after
completion of the talks here.
   Hopes have been buoyed by an agreement announced in New York
July 20 on a set of 14 principles designed to establish the basis
of peace in the region.
   Crocker, who takes part in the talks as a mediator, has
described the July 20 accord as an ``important step'' but has
warned that a ``great many hard and difficult compromises have yet
to be achieved.''
   The accord was the first joint document accepted by the three
parties locked in an undeclared war since 1975. The principles
include an end to South African administration of South-West Africa
and the withdrawal of all Cuban troops from Angola.
   South African, Angolan and Cuban military commanders who met in
a fourth round of talks late last month on Cape Verde off the West
African coast were reported to have made significant progress
toward the disengagement and withdrawal provisions.
   The Geneva talks were expected to focus on timetables for
military disengagement in southern Angola, and for the eventual
withdrawal of all Cuban troops from Angola and of South African
troops from Namibia. They are also to agree on provisions ensuring
U.N.-monitored compliance with the withdrawal schedules.
   Comments from other parties directly involved in the talks
ranged from cautious optimism voiced by South African officials to
Cuban President Fidel Castro's statement last week that the talks
are ``on the threshold of a political solution.''
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamyshin, who on Monday
completed two days of preliminary consultations with Crocker, later
told reporters chances are good of a settlement ``in the nearest
future.''
   Moscow is not directly involved but has been regularly consulted
by the United States. Both superpowers have spoken of a growing
convergence of views on the regional issues.
   South Africa's mandate over South-West Africa was terminated by
the United Nations in 1966. But in defiance of several U.N.
Security Council resolutions, it has retained control of the
country, which possesses considerable mineral wealth.
   Cuban troops, estimated by U.S. officials to total up to 50,000,
have helped the Marxist Angolan government to fight UNITA, the
rebel movement of Jonos, which receives military aid from South
Africa and the United States.
   Angola has also been used as a base by SWAPO, the South West
Africa People's Organization that has been waging an armed struggle
for Namibian independence since 1966.
   SWAPO and UNITA are not parties to the agreement but spokesmen
for both have welcomed it.

<HEAD>Reagan Gives Bush Campaign Present: Plant-Closing Law</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds full identification of Dukakis in 5th graf, On the</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, nearing the Republican presidential nomination,
flew to Chicago today for a foreign policy speech after receiving a
campaign present from President Reagan.
   While Bush headed west for what aides said would be a major
address, Reagan said he had decided to let a bill he opposes _ to
require companies to give workers 60 days notice before closing
plants _ become law without his signature.
   That could relieve some of the campaign pressure on Bush from
Democrats who have been using the issue to suggest the
administration lacks compassion for workers.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff who accompanied him to
Chicago, said Reagan's decision ``will make it more difficult for
the political game to be played over the plant-closing issue.''
   On the other side, an aide to Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, who has argued strongly in favor of a notification
provision in federal law, said of the decision: ``I think it's a
testament to the people around the nation who supported this bill
that it's finally going to be in effect.''
   Asked if Reagan's decision takes an issue away from Dukakis,
spokesman Dayton Duncan said, ``Not at all. The point is that
Ronald Reagan and George Bush tried to stop it. Where is George on
this? He used to oppose it.''
   Reagan, in a statement read by spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, said
the action was being taken to get the issue over with and have
Congress ``get on with the nation's business.''
   But Fitzwater also noted that the Democrats had been hitting
Republicans hard on the issue, and he said when asked if Reagan was
acting on political considerations, ``Certainly they're a part of
the equation.''
   Monday night in Detroit, Dukakis continued efforts to win over
former supporters of Jesse Jackson, telling a national civil-rights
organization that government can help ``transform the cycle of
poverty into a ladder of opportunity.''
   Earlier in the day, Reagan had asserted that Dukakis would
destroy that opportunity.
   Reagan's remarks Monday on behalf of a Senate candidate provided
the only Republican campaign salvo. Bush remained at the White
House while continuing to work on choosing a running mate.
   In a speech before the National Urban League in Detroit, Dukakis
accused the Reagan administration of having ``cramped ideals and
limited ambitions'' and spending huge amounts of money on wasteful
projects rather than helping blacks and poor people.
   ``We have to transform the cycle of poverty into a ladder of
opportunity, and that ladder must be sturdy and strong for all our
citizens,'' he said.
   ``Some people say it can't be done,'' he said. ``I say we
haven't tried.''
   Reagan, speaking to a fund-raiser for Sen. William V. Roth,
R-Del., took the Massachusetts governor to task for declaring in
his nomination acceptance speech that ``the Reagan era'' is ending.
   ``Does he want to end the era of lower tax rates and higher real
income for families, record numbers of jobs, low inflation and
interest rates, steady growth and respect, not just lip-service for
families?'' Reagan asked.
   He said that if the Democratic ticket is elected, ``all of us
may be picking up the pieces.''
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was working
on welfare legislation today on Capitol Hill.
   Jackson, at home in Chicago, spoke by telephone Monday with New
York Mayor Edward I. Koch as part of an effort to make peace at
least long enough to help Dukakis win the election.
   Koch criticized Jackson during the New York primary race, saying
Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for Jackson, who supports
Palestinian self-determination.
   ``I hope to work in support of Dukakis and then we'll continue
the ideological battle at another time,'' Koch said.
   Jackson did his part locally for Dukakis, telling some 5,000
members of the American Postal Workers Union: ``Bush believes
government is a tool for private industry. Dukakis believes the
government is a tool for public service.''
   Monday night in Charlotte, N.C., Jackson emphasized his own
defeated campaign for the presidency during remarks to nearly 6,000
people at the AME Zion Church.
   ``Politics is not a one-round fight,'' Jackson said. ``It's not
even an even fight. Sometimes referees, judges and the rules are
all stacked against you. And yet you can't surrender. You can't
lose by a forfeit. You can't have a glass jaw. You have to hang on
in there.''
   ``There are no more impossible dreams,'' he said. ``I'm taking
the ceiling off dreams every day. I may or may not make it to the
White House, but our children will. And they must.''
   Jackson referred directly to Dukakis only once, a brief mention
that the Massachusetts governor garnered more primary votes than he
did.
   In a continuation of a legal battle that flared last week, the
Federal Election Commission asked an appeals court to side with its
decision that the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign should get $46 million
in funds despite Bentsen's re-election campaign for the Senate.
Bentsen's challenger for the Senate seat and the Republican
National Senatorial Committee contend the presidential and
senatorial campaigns give Bentsen an unfair financial advantage.
   Dukakis had some welcome legal news waiting for him on the home
front. Law enforcement sources who spoke only on condition they not
be named said the FBI has informed Massachusetts that it found no
evidence that the Dukakis administration leaked confidential
information on prison-siting plans to developers who then bought
land and offered to sell it to the state.
   The allegations, lodged by opponents of plans to build a 500-bed
state prison in rural New Braintree, Mass., had been cited by
Dukakis critics to attack the good-government pledges at the center
of his presidential campaign.

   A bomb exploded today in a busy
shopping area, killing a policeman, and a soldier was shot and
killed after being dragged from a store in west Belfast, police
said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsiblity for
both attacks. Earlier today, the IRA said it launched a morning
ambush on an army patrol in which six part-time soldiers were
wounded. On Monday, the IRA blew up a British army barracks in
north London, killing one soldier and injuring nine.
   Belfast police Sgt. Harry Hussey said the bomb that killed the
police officer went off at 3:40 p.m. under a car in a main street
in Lisburn, 11 miles southwest of Belfast. At least 18 people were
injured by flying debris, Hussey said.
   About 20 minutes later, a gang accosted a member of the Ulster
Defense Regiment, a locally recruited and predominantly Protestant
unit of the British army, in a shopping center in Roman Catholic
west Belfast, Hussey said.
   The part-time soldier, who was shopping with his wife, was taken
outside and fatally shot, Hussey said.
   Today's string of attacks in Northern Ireland began this morning
when a land mine blew up near a Land Rover in the County Tyrone
village of Carland, slightly injuring six Ulster Defense Regiment
soldiers.
   After the explosion, the soldiers struggled out of the Land
Rover and guerrillas lying in ambush opened fire with machine guns.
Soldiers in the vehicle that was attacked or in another nearby army
Land Rover returned fire, a police spokesman said. The guerrillas
escaped.
   Police said the six injured men, all local recruits, were
treated for minor injuries at South Tyrone Hospital in Dungannon
and released. One suffered a broken arm.
   The police spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the
explosion occurred at 9:30 a.m. on the Cookstown Road in Carland, 4
miles from Dungannon and about 35 miles west of Belfast, where at
least two army Land Rovers were on patrol.
   Last month near Coalisland, a few miles away, security forces
found an 800-pound bomb abandoned by the IRA because cattle had
eaten through the command wires.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British
from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province
with the Irish Republic.

   The government ordered a security review of all
military bases after an IRA bomb killed one soldier and injured
nine at a north London army barracks considered an easy target for
a terrorist attack.
   In Northern Ireland today, the IRA killed a part-time soldier
and a policeman and wounded six soldiers in three separate attacks.
Eighteen bystanders were injured in one of the attacks.
   Security was reported so lax at Inglis Barracks in suburban Mill
Hill that the perimeter fence was riddled with holes and broken
traffic barriers were still unrepaired after two months.
   The barracks houses the Directorate of Defense Postal and
Courier Services, where a staff of 250 handles mail for British
armed services personnel around the world. It also houses some
personnel from the Royal Engineers, the Royal Navy and the Women's
Royal Army Corps.
   ``This was a soft target and this makes it an extremely cowardly
attack,'' Archie Hamilton, minister of state for the armed forces,
said of Monday's blast. ``We don't keep the military apart from the
community but we will obviously now have to review our security
arrangements.''
   Conservative Party legislator John Gorst, whose parliamentary
constituency includes the barracks, said security was appalling.
   ``With the benefit of hindsight, I think it would be crystal
clear that it would be possible to move into this place with
impunity and to move around without being challenged,'' he said.
   Monday's 7 a.m. blast, the fifth IRA attack since May against
British military targets outside Northern Ireland, knocked down
most of a two-story brick dormitory and started a fire.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a message to
the bureau of the British domestic news agency Press Association in
Belfast, Northern Ireland.
   The 15 men living in the dormitory were in bed when the
explosion tore out the first floor, an army spokesman said. The
building can accommodate up to 70 people.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the Republic of Ireland.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is on a trip to Australia,
today condemned the attack, describing it as ``a negation of
democracy.''
   ``It is again another lesson why no one, but no one, should
support the IRA or any form of terrorism,'' she said. ``They don't
like the results at the ballot box, so they turn to bombing,
maiming and killing.''
   Early today, a suspected land mine blew up near an army vehicle
in Northern Ireland, slightly injuring six part-time soldiers,
police said. The IRA claimed responsibility for the 9:30 a.m.
explosion in the village of Carland, about 35 miles west of Belfast.
   The IRA said it also was behind a bombing today in Lisburn, 11
miles from Belfast, in which a policeman was killed and 18
passers-by were wounded. The IRA also said its members shot and
killed a part-time soldier today after pulling him out of a store
in west Belfast.
   The blast in London raised new fears for British armed forces
personnel at home and abroad, because Inglis is only one of
hundreds of small, lightly guarded British bases.
   Reporters who went to the barracks after the blast found the
5-foot-high, wire mesh perimeter fence riddled with holes. One
section had a 50-foot gap.
   Monday's explosion was the first fatal attack by the IRA in
mainland Britain since guerrillas blew up Mrs. Thatcher's hotel
during a political convention in Brighton in October 1984. She
narrowly escaped injury, but five other people were killed in the
assassination attempt.
   On March 6 in Gibraltar, British commandos killed three unarmed
IRA guerrillas who were said to have been on a bombing mission.
   In apparent retaliation, the IRA resumed attacks on British
military targets in continental Europe after a 14-month lull.
   In the past three months, three British servicemen have been
killed and 12 other people injured in four machine-gun and bombing
attacks in West Germany and Holland.
   The soldier killed Monday was identified as 23-year-old Michael
Robbins, a lance corporal in the Royal Engineers.

   The United States is consulting with several
of its allies about the possibility of establishing an
international peace-keeping force in Cambodia once Vietnam pulls
out its troops, the State Department said today.
   An international force is one of several measures being
discussed by the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia and the
three main guerrilla factions fighting to overthrow it, said deputy
spokesman Phyllis Oakley.
   ``We have been consulting with our friends,'' she said, but
added that ``this is in a very preliminary stage.''
   The Phnom Penh government held a first round of talks last week
in Indonesia with the guerrillas and representatives of Vietnam to
work out a plan for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from
the country.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and China have all pledged
to support efforts to find a solution.
   The State Department comments followed a call by the chairman of
a key congressional panel to set up an international force to
prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., also urged the United States and
other western governments to prevent the re-emergence of the Khmer
Rouge, which he said ``could very easily lead to another holocaust
in Cambodia.''
   ``I think the West needs to do much more than what it has been
doing in order to prevent such a dreadful eventuality from coming
about,'' Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Asian and Pacific affairs, said on the CBS-TV ``This Morning''
program.
   The Khmer Rouge are accused of killing hundreds of thousands of
people from 1975 to 1978 while trying to turn Cambodia into a
primitive agrarian society.
   Vietnam ended the Khmer Rouge reign when it invaded Cambodia in
1978 and Vietnamese troops have occuped the nation since then.
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw its remaining 120,000 troops by
1990, but is demanding assurances that the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol
Pot, will not return to power. But the Khmer forces remain the
strongest of the three resistance groups fighting the Hanoi-backed
government in Phnom Phen.
   Talks between Vietnam, the resistance forces and other southeast
Asian nations were held last week in Indonesia, but little progress
was reported.
   Solarz called on the United States and other nations to pressure
China to end its military assistance to the Khmer Rouge and urge
Thailand to deny the Khmer guerillas the use of Thai territory as a
base.
   But he indicated more than diplomatic pressure is needed against
a Khmer army Solarz called a ``ruthless gang of murderers.''
   ``We need to prevail upon the Vietnamese to accept the
establishment of an international peace-keeping force which could
be sent into Cambodia as the Vietnamese withdraw in order to
provide some insurance against the return of the Khmer Rouge to
power,'' Solarz said.
   Dith Pran, a Cambodian who escaped captivity under the Khmer
Rouge and now works as a photographer for The New York Times,
appeared in the same interview as Solarz and urged western
governments to isolate the Khmer Rouge.
   ``I'm afraid another holocaust (could happen),'' said Pran,
whose escape was dramatized in the film ``The Killing Fields.''

   Five passengers and two crewmen escaped
injury today when the nose gear on an Allegheny Commuter plane
collapsed during an emergency landing at Indianapolis International
Airport, officials said.
   ``It was a delicate situation, but the pilot put it down very
gently and smoothly and he made it a happy ending,'' said Bob
Spitler, managing director of administration for the Indianapolis
Airport Authority.
   The crew of Flight 3876 was identified as pilot Roger Plymate
and copilot Arman Avakian, both based at Indianapolis, according to
Mickey Bowman, vice president for scheduling and planning of
Allegheny Commuter.
   The twin-engine turboprop Beechcraft left Indianapolis for
Owensboro, Ky., about 10 a.m. and the landing occurred at 11:08 a.m.
   Spitler said the pilot was preparing to land at Owensboro when
instruments showed the landing gear would not lock in place.
   ``He came back to Indianapolis because he could burn off fuel
and we have longer runways and more rescue equipment,'' said
Spitler.
   ``He held the nose gear off and then just let if fall down very
slowly,'' said Spitler. ``He skidded down the runway on his nose,
scraped the bottom of the plane and bent the propeller tips and
came to rest about 5,500 feet down the 7,600 foot runway.
   ``There was no further damage and no fire. The five passengers
left quickly and were taken to the main terminal by bus.''
   Spitler said crews were working to remove the crippled plane
from the runway.

   The United States sharply criticized Iraq
today for its use of chemical weapons against Iran, after a U.N.
team found the Iraqis were using deadly gases in large quantities.
   ``We condemn Iraq's use of chemical weapons,'' said deputy State
Department spokesman Phyllis Oakley. ``There can be no
justification whatsoever for this practice, and we condemn its use
anywhere.''
   The United States has in the past made its views on the subject
known to Iraq, she added. Mrs. Oakley declined to say whether a
similar message had been conveyed to Iraq since the U.N. report was
released Monday.
   A team that visited Iran and Iraq last month found that Iraq is
continuing to use mustard and nerve gas ``on an intensive scale''
despite frequent pleas that it stop.
   The U.N. inquiry was requested by Iran, which charged that Iraq
had killed thousands of people in the spring with chemicals. At
Iraq's request, the team later went to Baghdad but its report about
Iran's use of chemical weapons was much less detailed.
   The secretary-general is conducting talks with both sides on
ending their eight-year war and implementing a cease-fire.

   Bruce David Kimball, an Olympic silver
medalist in diving four years ago, was charged with two counts of
vehicular homicide today, after police said he ran his car into a
crowd of people, killing two people and injuring six others.
   Kimball, 25, posted $10,000 bond and was released from the
Hillsborough County Jail where he was taken late Monday night, said
sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa.
   Espinosa said Kimball, who survived an automobile crash in 1981
and recovered from injuries to finish second in platform diving
competition at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, was estimated to be
traveling 70 to 90 mph when his car struck three parked cars before
ramming into a group of 30 to 40 teen-agers standing on a dead-end
road.
   The road is a popular gathering place, and the crowd was
standing in the street, Espinosa said.
   The dead were identified as Kevin Gossic, 16, of Brandon, and
Robbie Bidell, 19, of East Hillsborough.
   Raymond Kerker, 16, of Brandon, was listed in fair condition at
Tampa General Hospital after surgeons reattached a leg. One other
injured person was listed in serious condition at Brandon Humana
Hospital, and the others were treated and released.
   A witness said she saw the car approaching but thought it would
stop.
   ``We were just standing around talking,'' Lara Beck, 17, said.
``We saw this car just come racing down. ... He was going so fast.
... He skimmed about three cars and then he started to hit one and
then another.''
   Kimball, of nearby Valrico, made the U.S. Olympic team in 1984,
just three years after a head-on automobile crash in Michigan left
every bone in his face broken. Kimball's leg was also broken,
ligaments in his knee were torn and his spleen had to be removed.
   A blood-alcohol test was administered after Monday night
accident, but results were not yet available.

   A school teacher who was fired
when she got tuberculosis nine years ago and whose case eventually
went to the U.S. Supreme Court has accepted a non-teaching position
with the school district and $125,000 in back pay.
   Gene Arline said Monday she would accept the Nassau County
School Board's offer to rehire her and pay the back wages ordered
by U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II.
   Mrs. Arline, a third-grade teacher, was fired after suffering a
relapse of the tuberculosis she had as a child.
   The Supreme Court ruled the ailment was a disability and that
Mrs. Arline was protected under a 1973 law prohibiting institutions
receiving federal funds from firing a person because of a handicap.
   The high court sent the case back to Moore, who told the board
it could rehire Mrs. Arline and pay her $125,470 in back pay or
sever all relations with her and pay $768,724.
   Mrs. Arline told the board she was afraid of potential public
outcry should she return to the classroom. The board said she could
work as an elementary school resource aid, handling teaching
materials.

   Two teen-age boys who allegedly confessed
to killing a bus driver in a vengeful shooting had planned to
hijack the vehicle and execute the passengers, police said.
   The boys, arrested Sunday night, were booked for investigation
of murder and remained in custody at a juvenile detention center.
They faced arraignment later today in the slaying of AC Transit
driver Billy ``B.J.'' Givens.
   Givens, 43, died Thursday shortly after being shot at
point-blank range with a .22-caliber rifle. Three passengers
suffered gunshot wounds.
   The suspects, 15 and 17, told police they wanted to avenge a
traffic accident that killed their friends' mother, Ellen Palmer,
police Lt. Jim Hahn said.
   ``They had several meetings to plan their attack. They were
going to board the bus, force the driver to a remote area and
execute him and any passengers that might be witnesses,'' Hahn
said. ``If the first bus was too crowded, they would wait for
(another).''
   But the two scrapped the plan at the last minute for an unknown
reason, Hahn said, when they boarded a bus with 20 people on it.
After the 17-year-old shouted obscenities at Givens, the driver
asked ``What's wrong?'' and was shot several times, police said.
   The day before, Mrs. Palmer, 52, was killed in a collision with
an AC Transit bus. Givens was not the driver, and the fatal
accident did not occur on his line, Hahn said.
   ``In their interviews with investigators, the juveniles gave the
sole motive for the murder as a retaliation against AC Transit for
what they perceived as the wrongful death of their friends'
mother,'' Hahn said.
   The older youth escaped six or seven months ago from a detention
center in San Leandro, where he had been sent in connection with
drug charges, Hahn said. A warrant had been filed for the younger
boy, who failed to appear in juvenile court recently on a burglary
charge, police said.
   Witnesses said four young men had stepped aboard Givens'
vehicle, but Hahn said Monday that only two youths actually got on
the bus. A third youth was a friend who followed the suspects in a
vain attempt to dissuade them from carrying out their plan, and the
fourth probably was a passer-by, he said.

<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists using a
one-person submersible craft plan Wednesday to make the first of 20
dives looking for hot springs at the bottom of Crater Lake, the
deepest lake in the United States.
   At a news conference on the lake rim, National Park Service
officials and researchers said they hope to confirm the existence
of thermal vents on the lake bottom and gather data on many other
features of the unusual body of water.
   Scientists began assembling gear for the unprecedented dive
Monday. The submersible craft, called ``Deep Rover'' and designed
for ocean exploration, was scheduled to be placed in the lake today.
   The lake, which resulted from the explosion of Mount Mazama
nearly 7,000 years ago, is 1,932 feet deep and is famous for its
clear, cobalt-blue water.
   The water's clarity is the main reason for the exploration of
the lake, which comes about halfway through a 10-year study
launched by Congress in 1983.
   Scientists in the 1970s noticed that a small device used to
measure the clarity of Crater Lake barely could be seen at 85 feet
below the lake's surface. Before then, the device frequently could
be seen as deep as 115 feet.
   Scientists theorize vents below the lake's floor may be altering
the clarity by stirring up sediment and plant life in the lake,
which has no inlets or outlets.
   Oregon State University researchers Jack Dymond and Robert
Collier will take turns manning the submersible vessel on the
dives. They discovered small vents on the lake bottom last summer
using a remote control diving device, and say there is sufficient
evidence to indicate the vents are hydrothermal _ that is, the
water coming from them is heated somehow.
   Dymond said it would ``require a remarkable coincidence of
events to justify any other hypotheses'' because of the chemical
differences found near the vents.
   Although the focus of the project is a search for geothermal
activity, the scientists are looking at it as a general study of
the famous lake, Dymond said.
   The lake has an ``incredible and complex volcanic, glacial, and
explosive history,'' he said.
   Officials said the major advantages of the Deep Rover, which
resembles a clear, plastic bubble, are its mobility and the
exceptional visibility the operator has, virtually 360 degrees.
Extending arms on the device can be used to collect water samples
and to probe into the vents.
   Dymond said it will allow the scientists to see crater walls
below the surface that for the most part have never been observed
before.
   The exploration will be based on Wizard Island in the lake. As a
result, the regular tour boat runs to the island have been
suspended until the end of the project Aug. 28.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Oscar Back To 20th Century Fox</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Oscar awarded to 20th Century Fox for the
development of CinemaScope has been ordered off the auction block
and back to the studio for safekeeping until its ownership is
decided.
   The statuette for technical achievement, which is smaller than
the figurines handed to producers, actors and directors, was
scheduled to be auctioned Tuesday with two other Oscars at the
Collectors' Bookstore in Hollywood.
   But Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel agreed with an attorney
representing the studio Monday that there were enough unresolved
questions about the Oscar's custody to prevent it from being sold.
   She set an Aug. 24 hearing on the matter.
   ``This is a real travesty of justice,'' said Collectors'
Bookstore owner Malcolm Willits after the ruling. ``Those
Indian-givers. Fox, after 34 years of not even missing it, is now
demanding it back.''
   Willits said the Oscar, presented in 1954, has been in the
possession of Esther Roberts, who was personal secretary for 15
years to late Fox President Darryl Zanuck.
   He declined to say why Roberts wanted to sell the statuette.
   Willits said Roberts discovered the Oscar in a back room at Fox
the year Zanuck accepted it. When she asked her boss about it,
Willits said Zanuck told her it had no sentimental value to him and
she could have it.
   But Fox attorney Louis Meisinger claimed in his lawsuit to stop
the auction of the statuette that Zanuck ``was acting in the
absence of any corporate resolution or other authorization'' when
he gave his secretary the Oscar.
   Willits countered that the powerful Zanuck ``reigned supreme''
at the studio and in the entertainment industry, and controlled at
that time a majority of Fox stock. He said it was obvious that
Zanuck needed to consult no one about giving away the statuette.
   Vogel ordered Collectors' Bookstore not to sell, conceal or
diminish the value of the statuette, and extended the order to
Roberts.
   Meisinger said the studio's legal claim on the Oscar evolved
through an agreement it signed with the Motion Picture Academy of
Arts and Sciences upon receipt in 1954 to offer the statuette back
to the Academy before selling it.
   The Academy since relinquished those rights to the studio, and
Fox argues that Roberts must offer the Oscar to it for a $10
consideration before she can sell it.
   Meisinger estimated the statuette's value at $3,000, and the
studio on Monday posted a $6,000 bond for its possession.
   Willits said he thought it would bring $10,000 at auction
because it was awarded to a major studio for an important
contribution.
   In CinemaScope, special lenses compress and distort images
during filming, while special projector lenses correctly
reinterpret the film on a special wide screen.

<HEAD>Students Charged $2.25 to Go to Bathroom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOCASTEE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Summer school students who went to the
bathroom outside of an approved break were charged $2.25 per visit,
to pay teachers who had to stay late with them to make up the lost
time.
   The policy at Socastee High School, which has been in effect for
many years, was denounced by some students as unfair, but Horry
County School Superintendent John Dawsey said it was not a hardship
for students and was necessary financially.
   The bathroom fee stems from a state rule that students are
required to attend 124 hours of summer school classes to make up
work they did not pass during the school year.
   When summer school students are late for class, leave early or
use the bathroom, they must make up the time lost after school, and
teachers must stay late with them.
   Students were charged a $100 fee for the six-week summer
session. For time missed from class, students were charged $2.25
per 15 minutes, derived from a breakdown of teacher salaries at $9
an hour.
   They were given one ``free'' break each day, during a half-hour
in the middle of the four hours.
   For 10th grader Angel Sparks, bathroom fees amounted to $20.25
for the six-week session.
   ``I think it's stupid,'' she said. ``You can't help it if you
have to go to the restroom. When you have to go, you have to go.
You shouldn't be charged for something like that _ it's dumb.''
   ``I thought it was unfair and unreasonable,'' said Keith Jones,
another 10th grader.
   But Dawsey said students should be able to limit their bathroom
trips to the break.
   ``Unless you've got diarrhea or food poisoning, your system is
such that you can go two hours without using the bathroom,'' he
said.
   Still, for next year, Dawsey said he will change the schedule a
bit. Instead of a 30-minute break after two hours, he said students
will be given 10-minute breaks after each of three hours.

   An arbitrator has refused to award damages to
a woman who charged that celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson
raped her, Mitchelson's lawyer said. The woman had sought $6.5
million.
   Bernard Selber, a retired Superior Court judge who sat as an
arbitrator in the case, refused to award damages to Patricia French
after a one-day hearing, Mitchelson's attorney, Harold Rhoden, said
Monday.
   The 1983 Superior Court lawsuit alleged that Mitchelson raped
Mrs. French three times at his office in 1981 and also failed to
return a $5,000 fee.
   Mrs. French never told police of the incident, and the district
attorney declined to prosecute when she contacted the office years
later, Rhoden said.
   Calls to Mrs. French's attorney were not returned.
   Another lawsuit filed by Kristan Barrett-Whitney, who also
accused Mitchelson of rape, is pending. The two women's allegations
were the subject of a recent ``60 Minutes'' program.
   Mitchelson has represented such clients as actress Joan Collins;
he was the lawyer in a landmark ``palimony'' case brought by the
live-in girlfriend of the late actor Lee Marvin.

   American and Filipino negotiators
Tuesday resumed talks on the status of U.S. military bases but gave
no indication of progress on the issue of compensation for the use
of the bases.
   After a meeting lasting more than two hours, the two panels
issued a statement saying they would meet again Wednesday. They
refused to answer questions.
   Tuesday's session was the first since talks broke off a week ago.
   According to the statement, the negotiators discussed
compensation _ the main problem _ as well as security around the
sites and the issue of criminal jurisdiction over U.S. troops.
   Filipino officials said last week that U.S. inflexibility over
compensation was responsible for the interruption in the talks.
   The United States pays the Philippines $180 million in military
and economic aid each year in exchange for the use of Clark Air
Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller facilities.
   Sources close to the talks said the Filipinos demand a raise of
at least $1.2 billion, but the Americans have refused. The sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Americans were
willing to increase compensation only by $360 million.
   The Americans have proposed that the Philippine side also
consider as compensation the $500 million the bases spend annually
in salaries to Filipino employees and on local purchases, the
sources said.
   After announcing the resumption of the talks Tuesday, Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus said, ``Our position has already been
subjected to change and we are not about to change it again.''
   A source, who asked not to be identified, said that during
Tuesday's session, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt and Manglapus
secluded themselves from the rest of the negotiatiors to discuss
the question of compensation.
   The sources said the Americans were reluctant to agree to a
drastic increase in compensation because of uncertainty over the
status of the bases after their lease expires in 1991.
   The lease may be extended by a formal treaty ratified by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases
is strong.
   The Senate in June approved a bill banning nuclear weapons and
nuclear- powered ships from Philippine territory. The United States
opposes such legislation because of its policy refusing to confirm
or deny the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons.
   President Corazon Aquino, whose term expires in 1992, has
pledged to honor the current agreement, but refuses to say whether
she will support an extension.
   The talks are part of negotiations that began four months ago to
review a 1947 agreement giving the Americans the right to operate
military bases in the Philippines.

   The University of Minnesota Hospital is
investigating its chief heart-lung surgeon for allegedly ordering
an associate to perform a bypass operation on a patient considered
dead before surgery began, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Hospital officials also are looking into an allegation that
Stuart Jamieson or one of his assistants left a pair of surgical
forceps in another heart patient's chest, then failed to inform the
patient, the patient's family or operating room personnel when the
instrument was removed during a second operation, the Minneapolis
Star Tribune said in a copyright story.
   Jamieson, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of
Minnesota Hospital and director of its Heart-Lung Institute,
declined to comment, but spokeswoman Sue Swenson said Jamieson has
denied all the accusations in interviews with hospital officials.
   ``What you have are rumors that are the product of professional
jealousy,'' Ms. Swenson said. ``Dr. Jamieson has decided not to
dignify them with a response.''
   Jamieson, a former director of Stanford University Medical
Center's heart-lung transplant program, was hired by the university
in March 1986 to develop a similar program, the first in the
Midwest.
   The newspaper quoted sources who said that Jamieson overruled a
heart surgeon in his department on May 5 and ordered her to perform
a coronary artery bypass on a 43-year-old woman. Minutes earlier,
the surgeon had canceled the operation because she believed the
patient was dead.
   However, about 10 minutes after the operation was canceled, the
surgeon notified operating room nurses the bypass would be
performed after all, on orders from Jamieson. After the operation,
the patient remained attached to a mechanical heart pump but never
regained consciousness, the newspaper said.
   A hospital pathologist who performed an autopsy concluded the
surgery had been unnecessary since the woman either was clinically
dead at the time or had no chance of surviving the bypass operation.
   The woman's medical insurance carrier was billed more than
$22,000 for that operation and for a second, exploratory operation
hours later in which doctors attempted to stop internal bleeding.
   Jamieson also is under investigation for allegedly failing to
disclose that a pair of forceps had been left in the chest cavity
of a 78-year-old man who underwent a coronary artery bypass April
15, the newspaper said.
   The forceps were discovered in a routine chest X-ray, but the
three X-rays showing the location of the forceps have been missing
from the patient's medical records since shortly after the second
operation was performed, the newspaper said.
   The patient's insurance company was billed about $19,000 for the
two operations, the newspaper said.
   Jamieson has told hospital officials that no forceps were found
in the patient's chest.

   Modifications are needed on five types of
Whirlpool undercounter dishwashers that could catch fire, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission warned Tuesday.
   Whirlpool Corp. of Benton Harbor, Mich., is offering to replace
the potentially faulty selector switch on the approximately 75,000
dishwashers, the commission reported.
   Involved are Whirlpool undercounter dishwasher models
DU7400XS-0, DU7600XS-0, DU7800XS-0, DU900XR-0 and DU900XR-1.
   According to the company, the pushbutton selector switch, under
certain circumstances, could catch fire. Twelve incidents have been
reported, the safety agency said.
   Whirlpool is asking owners of the washers to telephone the
company at 1-800-541-5746 to arrange for the free repairs.
Consumers can check the model number on a plate found on the right
front edge of the tub after the door is opened.
   Safety officials urged owners not to use the washers until the
repairs are completed.
   Consumers needing more information can contact the safety
commission at 1-800-638-2772.

   Postage stamp sales are a big success in
supermarkets and are being extended experimentally to banks and
subway stations, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank reported
Tuesday.
   Frank told the Postal Service board of governors meeting in
Seattle that the mail agency and SeaFirst Bank of Seattle have
agreed to a one-year experiment selling stamps through the bank's
automatic teller machines.
   The teller machines will sell stamps at banks and at some postal
facilities where they will be installed said Frank, whose statement
was released here.
   At the same time, he said, vending machines will be installed in
stations of the Washington Metro subway system for one year to
dispense postal items as well as Metro materials.
   An earlier test of selling stamps through supermarkets has
proved widely popular, Frank said. Stamp sales have expanded to 22
major grocery chains with 13,000 outlets across the nation.

   A 14-hour uprising at a maximum-security
prison ended peacefully early today when inmates, who had
complained of being harassed by officers, released the last four of
their five hostage guards.
   Two guards at the state's Coxsackie Correctional Facility were
hospitalized and listed in good condition this morning. Three
others were treated and released for minor injuries. One inmate
received minor injuries.
   A guard who went into the prison after the uprising said the
inmates had destroyed their unit, designated for inmates with
disciplinary problems.
   ``It was 15 hours of terror'' for the guards, state Corrections
Commissioner Thomas Coughlin said.
   At a news conference in Albany today, Gov. Mario Cuomo and
Coughlin described the uprising as an unorganized chain of events
that escalated quicker than the inmates had intended.
   ``What we're dealing with is a mob,'' Coughlin said. ``It was a
bunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32. There was no
planning, there was no organization. They knocked an officer down,
they took two other officers' nightsticks and they said, `Oh my
God, look what we've done now.'''
   Cuomo said earlier, ``A potentially explosive confrontation has
been defused without loss of life, or the surrender to any
demands.''
   Inmates seized the guards about 10:30 a.m. Monday during a
recreation period, said James Flateau, a spokesman for the state
Corrections Department. The unit housed 32 inmates, but it was not
known how many participated in the uprising, said Flateau.
   Inmates throughout the prison remained confined to their cells
this morning, he said.
   Coughlin said he wasn't sure what provoked the takeover, which
began when an unidentified inmate attacked guard Lewis Bloom in a
recreation yard and took his nightstick. Then seven other inmates
overpowered two more guards, took their nightsticks and and command
of the unit.
   Coughlin said none of the inmates had additional weapons,
although he said one may have taken a guard's pocket knife.
   Cuomo and Coughlin said no demands were made during
negotiations, which were mostly between two inmates and prison
Superintendent John Twomey, who was assisted by a department crisis
intervention unit.
   Cuomo said the inmates had only requested that they not be
beaten up when they released their hostages.
   ``I think they got tired,'' Coughlin said. ``I think they felt
very strongly that they were in over their heads after the initial
assault and for a number of hours last night, I think they were
trying to figure a way out. We just sat back and waited and kept
talking to them and kept giving them their options.''
   Earlier, Flateau had said some of the inmates had complained
about verbal harassment by guards. ``Verbal harassment was the
(complaint) they mentioned most often, food complaints, things like
that,'' Flateau said. But he later said harassment was not the
major point being negotiated.
   Outside the prison, which houses 951 inmates, guard Ralph Scott
said inmates had been warning for weeks that there might be
trouble. In the last two weeks, he said, prisoners' verbal and
physical assaults on corrections officers had increased.
   But Coughlin said this morning that the prison showed none of
the usual signs of an imminent uprising.
   ``The indicators that I judge were not there,'' Coughlin said.
``Sure, people were saying it was getting tense. Prisons are tense
in hot weather.''
   Cuomo had said earlier he did not think the generally crowded
condition of New York prisons contributed to the problem because
``capacity is not a problem'' at Coxsackie.
   Guard David Pratt, 31, of Coxsackie, was upgraded today from
serious to good condition with abdominal injuries, said Albany
Medical Center spokeswoman Mary MacIntosh.
   The three others released this morning _ Bloom, 41, of Freehold;
Douglas Roberts, 37, of Troy; and John Shipley, 32, of Scotia _
were treated and released, she said.
   A guard released Monday night, Warren Agostinoni, 28, of Cairo,
was in good condition with cuts and bruises, said another
spokeswoman, Peggy Pitcher.
   Inmate Anthony Milo, 19, was treated for chest and back injuries
and released, Pitcher said.
   A guard who said he helped carry Bloom out to an ambulance said
this morning his colleague was ``badly battered. I believe all of
them were.''
   Joe Kraft, president of Local 1264 of the prison guards' union,
also said broken glass was strewn about the prison unit, there was
an inch of water on the ground and cabinets were moved, he said.
   ``There was probably nothing that could be destroyed that they
didn't destroy,'' Kraft said. Coughlin said today that the unit
will require repairs but he wouldn't elaborate.

   The United States is holding
billions of dollars worth of impounded Iranian military equipment
and Iran has raised the issue in connection with American hostages
in Lebanon.
   Statements last week by Iran's acting commander-in-chief,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, marked the third time since the 1979 seizure of
the 52 American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran that the
issue of Iranian assets frozen by the United States has been linked
to American hostages.
   ``If he is talking about military equipment, then the
arbitration of Iran's claim against the United States for the value
of spare parts and other equipment ordered before the revolution is
continuing,'' said an American official at the Iran-U.S. Claims
Tribunal.
   The tribunal is adjudicating billions of dollars worth of claims
arising out of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The American official
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iran has filed a $12 billion claim against the United States for
the miltary equipment and spare parts, the largest claim before the
tribunal. Iran seeks delivery of the equipment or payment of its
value.
   The military materiel was ordered by Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's government through the U.S. government's Foreign Military
Sales program.
   Transfer of the equipment to Iran, as well as billions of
dollars of Iranian funds on deposit in American banks, was frozen
by the U.S. government after the seizure of the embassy hostages.
   The Algiers Accords that resulted in freedom for the hostages in
January 1981 also unblocked the Iranian assets.
   But despite the Algiers Accords, the military equipment, much of
which was already paid for, was then impounded by the U.S.
government to prevent its use in the Iran-Iraq War.
   ``We do have a bunch of their (Iran's) stuff, and there's no
question that it's their stuff,'' said a tribunal official, who
also spoke on condition he not be identified.
   In August 1980, almost 10 months after the hostage seizure, Iran
said at the United Nations that the United States' release of the
frozen Iranian funds would be a ``symbolic gesture'' that might
speed the Iranian parliament's debate on the fate of the 52
American hostages.
   In addition to freedom for the hostages, the 1981 Algiers
Accords effectively worked out guidelines for the arbitration of
financial claims against Iran and the return of money left over.
   The American official at the tribunal said that the $9 billion
in financial assets frozen by the United States already has been
returned to Iran or dispersed to its creditors via the Algiers
Accords, which established the tribunal.
   The bulk of the money went to repay bank loans to Iran, but
$2.915 billion left after repayment was returned to Iran during the
course of 1981.
   In late 1986, Rafsanjani reportedly linked the return of
U.S.-held Iranian assets to possible Iranian intercession for
Americans taken hostage in Lebanon.
   The issue came up against the backdrop of negotiations for the
release of $451.4 million in a New York Federal Reserve Bank
account.
   That money was the residue of $3.667 billion deposited at the
bank to repay syndicated bank loans owed by Iran.
   The reported hostage-assets link was later denied by Iran, and
the $451.4 million was paid to Iran in May 1987.
   Much of the impounded military materiel, which reportedly
includes spare parts for Iran's outgunned air force, is stored in
various private warehouses rented by Iran.
   On July 27, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Rafsanjani, who is also speaker of the Iranian parliment, as saying
that ``if (President) Reagan were sincere ... he would release the
Iranian assets. I have said that once he does so then we will use
our leverage in Lebanon and help solve the issue of the hostages.''
   The agency said Rafsanjani ``cited the example of the United
States' freezing of and its refusal to deliver the items purchased
and paid for during the shah's rule in Iran.''
   On Monday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disclosed that
the Iranian government had communicated directly to the U.S.
government its insistence that the United States release Iranian
assets.
   U.S. officials reiterated that they would not enter into any
discussions with Iranian officials to negotiate the release of the
nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon by people sympathetic to the
revolutionary government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

   Parliament on Tuesday voted unanimously to
amend the constitution to give the president greater control over
the judiciary and to broaden police arrest power.
   The changes were pushed through Parliament just five days after
Attorney General Matthew Muli proposed them in the official Kenya
Gazette.
   Clergymen and the Law Society of Kenya opposed the changes,
warning that they would weaken constitutional checks and balances
and erode individual liberties.
   The changes empower the president to fire a High Court or Court
of Appeals judge without having to go through the current tribunal
process and without giving a reason.
   Parliament also voted to expand from 24 hours to 14 days the
period in which police can hold a person suspected of a capital
offense before bringing him to court.
   There normally is a 14-day period between the time a bill is
proposed and Parliament debates it. But legislators voted Tuesday
to reduce the waiting period for debate on the constitutional
changes to the elapsed five days.
   Joshua Angatia was the only member of the 201, one-chamber
legislature to vote against the procedural change that allowed for
the quick debate and vote.
   The bill was read three times, as required by law. Votes were
taken only on the second and third reading.
   The vote on the second reading was 151-0 in favor of the
constitutional changes. By the time the third vote was set, more
members had entered the chamber and the bill passed 160-0.
   Kenya, by law, is a one party state and the approval of the
constitutional changes had been expected.
   Tuesday's bill was the 10th amendment to the constitution since
1969.
   In December 1986, Parliament amended the constitution to remove
tenure for the offices of attorney general and auditor-general.
   Lawyers and clergymen fought against those changes, saying they
reduced the independence of the attorney general and the
auditor-general.
   The constitution was written in 1969 to update a bulky 1963
independence constitution which had become cumbersome because of
numerous amendments.

   Sybil Ludington is foaming at the mouth
again and Putnam County officials are considering having her head
cut off.
   Decapitation is one proposal for the repair of a statue of
Sybil, who was 16 in 1777 when she rode through the countryside
warning the colonists that the British were burning Danbury, Conn.
   The statue, of Sybil on a horse, overlooks Lake Gleneida in
downtown Carmel.
   The problem is white corrosion around the mouth of the statue,
which makes it look as if Sybil is foaming. The corrosion has been
removed several times but always returns.
   County Legislator Lynn Greenwood said a foundry in Beacon has
recommended that the head be removed to get at the source of the
corrosion.
   A company in Connecticut, however, says it can correct the
problem while keeping the statue intact. Both estimates are under
$10,000.
   The statue is valued at $150,000. It was a gift to the county
chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1962 from a
sculptor in Danbury.
   Sybil's story has been the subject of a postage stamp, a song, a
poem and a play.

   Fort Worth's efforts to promote tourism
fell apart _ literally _ when an envelope containing pamphlets and
the city's ``Fun Guide'' tore in the mail.
   The package was mailed to a fictitious ``Priscilla Whiteside''
in San Francisco. Unknown to the tourism bureau, the address
funneled mail to Consumer Reports Travel Letter so the editors
could rank responsiveness to tourists' requests.
   The travel letter received only the fun guide and ranked Fort
Worth the worst of the 46 cities that sent mail to ``Priscilla
Whiteside.''
   Tom Hanlon, director of Fort Worth's tourism bureau, called a
news conference Monday after USA Today publicized the travel
letter's findings. His staff, he said, will begin designing a new
cover folder that he hopes won't break apart.
   Fort Worth wasn't the only city with mail trouble. Los Angeles
sent an elaborate package that arrived as the 60,000-circulation
monthly magazine was going to press. As a result, the City of the
Angels was unranked.
   The big winners were San Francisco, Houston, Cincinnati,
Portland, Ore., Milwaukee and Long Beach, Calif.

   When television engineer Brent Perry wanted
his relationship with his girlfriend to progress from ``The Dating
Game'' to ``The Newlywed Game,'' he turned to a 30-second spot.
   The 26-year-old KOTV operations engineer bought the time in the
middle of his station's noon newscast to air his marriage proposal
to Sandra Vanderlugt, a teacher at Victory Christian School.
   ``I wanted to do something completely original when I asked her
to marry me,'' Perry said.
   Wearing a tuxedo and reciting his proposal in verse, he taped
the spot in front of Gilcrease Museum. On Monday, the first
anniversary of the couple's relationship, Perry said they watched
television together.
   ``It was perfect timing because they had just gone to a
commercial on the news so I just turned up the TV and there I
was,'' he said.
   ``She couldn't believe it. She kept asking me if this was really
me on TV,'' Perry said. ``The important thing was, she said yes, so
I felt like it was all worth it.''
   Perry said he and Miss Vanderlugt plan to be married next year.

   A Lutheran minister and a journalist
accused of smuggling two pregnant Salvadorans into the United
States were acquitted today by a federal jury.
   The U.S. District Court jury, which was given the case Monday
afternoon, returned innocent verdicts on all counts after 4{ hours
of deliberations.
   The Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert, 44, had been charged with one count
of conspiracy and two counts each of transporting, harboring and
inducing Ines Campos-Anzora and Cecelia Elias-Alegria to enter the
United States.
   Demetria Martinez, 28, had been charged with one count of
conspiracy to violate immigration laws and two counts each of
transporting and inducing the women to enter the United States.
Their trial began July 13.
   Outside court, Remer-Thamert called the verdict a victory for
the sanctuary movement, a grassroots effort that has been going on
since 1980 to aid refugees from Central America.
   Ms. Martinez said she hoped the ``victory will encourage other
reporters to get out and find out what the government has to hide
in its role in the situation in El Salvador.''
   U.S. Attorney William Lutz said he believed there was good
evidence the Salvadoran women entered the country illegally and
were transported illegally.
   ``But the question was one of intent and the jury disagreed with
our position on what the intent was,'' he said.
   U.S. District Judge John Conway on Monday denied a defense
motion for a mistrial made on the basis of evidence introduced
early in the trial regarding two mail fraud charges against
Remer-Thamert. Conway has thrown out those charges, ruling the
prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence.
   Alice Hector, attorney for Remer-Thamert, portrayed her client
as a religious man who believed he could legally help two refugees
under then-Gov. Toney Anaya's proclamation declaring New Mexico a
sanctuary state.
   Ms. Martinez's attorney, Tova Indritz, contended her client went
as a journalist on the August 1986 trip to bring the women to
Albuquerque and was protected by the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of the press.
   But Lutz said the case concerned the smuggling of illegal aliens
to put their babies up for adoption and then send the mothers back
to El Salvador.
   ``It's about two people who thought they were above the law,''
said Lutz.
   He called the situation of the two Salvadoran women an American
tragedy. ``Cecelia and Ines are victims,'' Lutz said.
   Lutz also said the defendants knew Anaya's proclamation was not
valid, citing the fact that they took a back road to avoid the U.S.
Border Patrol in bringing the women from El Paso, Texas, to
Albuquerque.
   But Ms. Hector said it made sense for Remer-Thamert to believe
he was acting legally because of the declaration.
   She said that in 1986 there were conflicting statements about
the meaning of the sanctuary declaration, which does not contain
the words ``symbolic proclamation.''
   Ms. Hector also cited statements the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service made at the time that people would be
deluded into relying on the proclamation.
   ``If they thought no one would believe it, why did they warn
people about it?'' she said.
   Ms. Indritz said Ms. Martinez, who writes for the Albuquerque
Journal and National Catholic Reporter, made no arrangements for
the women and did not help them.
   Ms. Martinez testified she never wrote about the women because
she feared it could jeopardize their safety or their families in El
Salvador.
   ``The mere fact someone does not write an article does not mean
she was not engaged in news gathering,'' Ms. Indritz said.
   The attorney also attacked the credibility of the two
Salvadorans, who testified as prosecution witnesses. She said their
testimony contradicted other evidence and testimony and at times
they contradicted themselves.

   A nurse was sentenced to nine years
in prison on a no-contest plea to trying to kill an AIDS-stricken
lawyer by posing as a doctor and prescribing a lethal dose of
insulin.
   Superior Court Judge Laurence J. Rittenband on Monday sentenced
Hal Speers Rachman, 42, to seven years on the attempted murder
charge and two years for his no-contest plea to five counts of
forgery.
   Police said Rachman stole $30,000 from the man by forging
withdrawal slips from his savings account and using stolen credit
cards.
   Rachman's pleas entered July 18 were part of a deal with
prosecutors who agreed to dismiss seven counts of credit card
forgery and one count of grand theft.
   Rachman, a registered nurse who worked with a temporary nursing
service, was accused of calling St. John's Hospital and Health
Center on Sept. 20, 1986, and ordering insulin for an AIDS patient
he had taken to the hospital three days earlier.
   The patient was given the insulin and fell into a coma. He was
revived but died four days later. An autopsy showed he died of
AIDS-related cancer.

<HEAD>Railroad Workers Challenge Police Drug Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three railroad employees forced to undergo
drug testing after they found a corpse on a stretch of track have
accused police of violating their constitutional rights.
   The Railway Labor Executives Association, representing the men
in a federal lawsuit, claims police acted unconstitutionally
because there was no probable cause and because they ignored
provisions on worker testing outlined in the Federal Railroad
Safety Act.
   According to the complaint, filed July 13, the three Soo Line
employees were working on a switch engine early May 29 in a
Minneapolis train yard when they discovered the corpse on the
tracks near the Nicollet Bridge.
   The plaintiffs alleged there was no evidence the dead man had
been involved in a train crash or had been struck by a train, yet
police took the three in for drug and alcohol testing.
   The men were made to undergo urine tests, which came back
negative, without probable cause or suspicion they were impaired by
alcohol or drugs or were in any way involved in the man's death,
according to the suit, which names Police Chief Anthony Bouza.
   Police also violated the Federal Railroad Safety Act, which
delegates to the U.S. secretary of transportation the authority to
set appropriate regulations and standards for all areas of railroad
safety _ chemical testing included, the suit alleged.
   Police are pre-empted from testing railroad workers except as
permitted by the federal act and this incident was not an
exception, it contended.
   The lawsuit asks the court to find that the testing of the three
men was unconstitutional and that testing in such situations is
governed by federal regulations.
   Steve Fredrickson, assistant Minneapolis city attorney who will
handle the case, said he couldn't comment on the suit until he had
conferred with Bouza about the department's position. Bouza said he
wouldn't not comment until he had read the complaint.

<HEAD>Fire Death Totals Stuck on Plateau</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's fire deaths shrank just a fraction
last year to 5,810, the sixth year that preventive strategies
failed to make a significant dent in the death toll, the National
Fire Protection Association said Tuesday.
   The number of civilians who died in 1987 decreased less than 1
percent from 1986's total of 5,850 deaths, according to the report
compiled by the Quincy-based association. Firefighter deaths were
not included in the totals.
   Reasons for the six-year plateau in the death toll include
waning interest in home safety, a slowing in development of fire
retardant home products, which made significant advances in the
last decade, and growth in the high-risk populations of the elderly
and the very young, said Dr. John R. Hall Jr., the association's
director of fire analysis and research.
   ``We're somewhat grasping at explanations, too,'' Hall said.
``Fire is so complicated that you can't say for sure you know
what's driving it. We've reached a point where those national
strategies like smoke detectors that were big enough and effective
enough ... have leveled off.''
   Home fires killed 4,570 people last year, down 1.8 percent from
4,655 in 1986, but they still accounted for 78.6 percent of all
fire deaths.
   Since 1984, there has been little progress in installing smoke
detectors and about one-third of those already in place are
inoperable, many because of dead batteries, Hall said.
   Fires caused by smoking materials remain the leading cause of
fatal home blazes, Hall said. The most common fires are caused by
cigarettes smoldering in couches or chairs, he said.
   Outdoor fires were up 10 percent, with 56,000 more brush, grass,
wildland, crop and timber fires, an increase partly blamed on
drought conditions.
   ``You've got an arson problem in outdoor fires. You've got a lot
of carelessness, then if you drop the weather situation on top of
that, what might have been a small fire turns into a large fire.''
   The South led all regions with a fire death rate of 29.0 per
million population, a regional rate that was 21.1 percent higher
than the national average of 23.9 per million. The higher incidence
of fire deaths in the South is partly due to its large population
of rural poor, Hall said.
   The number of civilians injured in fires totaled 28,215 in 1987,
a 5.2 percent increase from the previous year that brought figures
back to the levels of 1984-85.
   The Northeast region had the highest civilian fire injury rate
with 126.4 fire injuries per million population, but that was
similar to other regions, the report said.
   Property damage increased 4.9 percent to $7.04 billion, in
keeping with inflation, the report said.
   Breaking the impasse on fire deaths will require more widespread
education programs, renewed attention to home smoke detectors,
wider use of residential sprinklers and improvements in products
typically involved in home fatal fires, such as cigarettes and
lighters, said Michael J. Karter Jr., a senior statistician with
the association and author of the report.
   National Fire Prevention Week in October will focus on
installing and maintaining smoke detectors, Hall said.
   ``Our biggest obstacle right now is trying to break through that
misguided belief in personal invulnerability. All we can do is
point to the numbers.''

Finds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Amorous but sterile male Mediterranean fruit
flies tinted shocking pink were released today over the San
Fernando Valley to breed fertile flies out of existence.
   Buckets of sterilized flies were unleashed starting at 10 a.m.
by workers in trucks cruising neighborhoods 20 miles northwest of
downtown. Four million flies were being released.
   An airplane was to release more flies in the afternoon, said
Robert Donley, deputy director of the county Agriculture Commission.
   The release follows the weekend discovery of two Medflies in the
valley, bringing the total to six. Earlier aerial spraying also was
aimed at the pest that threatens the state's $14 billion-a-year
agricultural industry.
   The tiny flies, dyed fluorescent pink to distinguish them from
fertile wild Medflies, mate with females so their eggs will never
hatch. The eggs can be deposited inside more than 250 varieties of
fruits and vegetables.
   ``They're interested in eating and mating,'' state Agriculture
Department spokeswoman Gera Curry said. ``They'll all go their
little ways looking for mates.''
   The latest two live Medfly captures occurred in a backyard in
Reseda, inside a 62-square-mile quarantine area, said Robert
Donley, deputy director of the Los Angeles County Agriculture
Commission.
   The immature male flies, one found Saturday, the other Sunday,
are thought to have survived last week's malathion pesticide
spraying because they were in ground cocoons, Donley said.
   Officials think the flies flew almost immediately to the baited
traps after emerging from their cocoons, Donley said, adding that
ground spraying was carried out at the property.
   The discovery won't force another round of aerial pesticide
spraying, he said.
   Officials removed thousands of traps in preparation for the
sterile fly release, Donley said. Previously, more than 100 traps
per square mile were hung from trees in the residential
neighborhoods, he said.
   The first release of 4 million from an airplane and roving
trucks was to be followed by daily releases for about two months,
totaling between 20 million and 40 million flies weekly, coverering
two possible generations of Medfly development, Donley said.
   Similar use of sterile male flies helped eradicate Medfly
infestation in eastern Los Angeles County last summer.
   Three Medflies were discovered July 20 in fruit tree traps, and
a fourth was found just before officials sprayed a 16-square-mile
area of Northridge, Reseda and Sepulveda on July 25.
   The Medflies are feared because they reproduce rapidly and use
so many different fruits and vegetables as egg-laying sites,
infesting the fruit with maggots.
   Medflies are often brought to the mainland accidentally by
tourists who bring fruits from Hawaii and Pacific Rim nations.
   The sterile flies may wander into homes, but pose no health
threat to humans, and most people won't notice them, Ms. Curry said.
   The sterile flies are raised at a state laboratory in Hawaii.
The lab was established after the California's damaging 1981 Medfly
infestation, which cost the state $97.6 million in eradication
efforts.

<HEAD>Common Cause Counts $9.8 Million in Speaking Fees to Lawmakers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special-interest groups gave $9.8 million in
speaking fees to members of Congress last year in hopes of
influencing legislation, the public interest lobby Common Cause
said Tuesday in arguing that the practice should be banned.
   ``Members of Congress simply cannot fully meet their public
responsibilities when they are indebted to private interest groups
who are paying them large honoraria fees,'' said Common Cause
President Fred Wertheimer.
   Large amounts of money are going into the pockets of legislators
with direct jurisdiction over matters of interest to the interest
groups, the group said.
   ``These fees are being used to try to influence congressional
decisions,'' said Wertheimer. ``Honoraria fees are undermining the
integrity of Congress and should be banned outright.''
   At the same time, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, endorsed
the concept of a ban on outside speaking and writing fees if it is
linked to a pay raise for members of Congress.
   Wright disagreed with the contention that the fees influence
lawmakers in their policymaking, but he acknowledged there is an
appearance of a conflict of interest that warrants banning the
practice.
   ``I've seen the growth in honoraria by trade associations and
the appearance of it has been made to look evil, so let's get rid
of it,'' Wright told a group of reporters at a luncheon Monday.
``It would be a very healthy thing for Congress.''
   A Common Cause study found that senators received a total of
$3.1 million in honoraria in 1987, according to their financial
disclosure reports, an average of $31,000 each. House members got a
combined total of $6.7 million, averaging $15,500 apiece.
   The averages don't tell the full story, however. Some members
refuse to accept honoraria, and others _ particularly committee
chairmen and influential senior members _ are in positions to
garner far more than the average amount.
   House members are allowed by law to keep for their own use an
amount of outside earned income up to 30 percent of their salaries.
That meant they could keep as much as $25,885 in 1987. Senators
could keep up to 40 percent of their salary amount, or $34,993.
Amounts received in excess of those limits had to be donated to
charity.
   Current congressional salaries are $89,500 a year, but a
presidential commission appointed to study the politically delicate
pay issue has recommended that they be raised to $135,000.
   Some forms of income, such as book royalties, are not included
in the lid on outside earned income. Wright's receipt of more than
$60,000 in such royalties is among six counts now under
investigation by the House ethics committee.
   The Common Cause study focused on the House and Senate Commerce
and Banking committees as particularly subject to honoraria
payments from groups with interest in their legislative areas.
   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee got a total
of 905,000 in fees from interest groups in 1987, nearly half of it
from communications, energy and health interests with legislative
matters under the panel's jurisdiction, the study found. Senate
Commerce Committee members received $662,000, one-quarter of it
from communications and transportation interests.
   The House and Senate Banking committees each received in excess
of $600,000 in speaking fees last year. For the House panel, nearly
half came from financial interests, and for the Senate committee,
the proportion was 26 percent.
   For Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., the leading honoraria recipient on
the House Banking Committee, 70 percent of his $36,780 came from
financial groups, the study found. Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the
panel's senior Republican, received $25,050, 89 percent of it from
financial interests.
   Among interest groups, the top givers in the study were the
American Trucking Associations, which gave $117,500 in fees to 21
senators and 62 House members; the National Association of
Broadcasters, which gave $114,300 in honoraria; the Securities
Industry Association, $110,000; the Tobacco Institute, $102,000;
and the investment firm Paine Webber, $100,688.

   Criminal cases have gone to court against 20
people charged in ethnic rioting in the Caucasus, and Communist
Party leaders from Azerbaijan and Armenia met to discuss ways to
ease remaining tensions, Tass said Tuesday.
   The riots erupted Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait,
leaving 32 people dead, 26 of them Armenians, and more than 200
people injured.
   The unrest began amid an emotional Armenian campaign calling for
the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh to be annexed by Armenia.
   The disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has been part of Azerbaijan
since 1923. Its population is more than three-quarters Armenian,
but it has no common borders with the Armenian republic.
   The official Soviet news agency quoted the Soviet prosecutor's
office as saying that 94 people had been arrested to date in the
Sumgait rioting, ``among them murderers, rapists and robbers.''
   In addition, Tass said 200 apartments in Sumgait were ransacked,
about 50 cultural and service facilities damaged, and 40 cars
vandalized and some set on fire.
   Sixteen criminal cases involving 20 defendants in the rioting
have been submitted to court, Tass said. It gave no indication of
when trial would begin, or where.
   On July 8, the Soviet Supreme Court and the prosecutor's office
transferred the legal cases against the rioters out of Azerbaijan
and into courts of the Russian republic.
   That demand had been voiced by Armenian activists, who said the
courts in Azerbaijan were incapable of ruling fairly in cases where
Azerbaijanis were accused of attacking Armenians.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet intervened in the dispute on
July 18, ruling that the district will remain in Azerbaijan and
calling for measures to develop the district's economy and culture.
   The Presidium, the nation's top executive body, also dispatched
an envoy to the area, Arkady Volsky, as its representative and that
of the Central Committee, the Communist Party's policy-making body.
   Tass said Volsky met Tuesday with Armenian party chief Soren
Arutyunan and Azerbaijan party boss Abdul Rakhman Vezirov in
Stepanakert, capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   The leaders discussed how to fulfill decisions of the party and
state leadership on bringing the situation back to normal in
Nagorno-Karabakh and stimulating the area's economic and social
development, Tass said.
   Armenians have accused the Azerbaijani leadership of ignoring
the needs of the region's Armenian population.
   ``It is impermissible that the decisions adopted by the party
and the government are so far being fulfilled in an unsatisfactory
manner by union ministries and agencies, by republican and regional
bodies,'' Tass said.
   The participants in the Stepanakert meeting called for
``exhaustive measures'' to rectify the situation, Tass said.
   It did not say what steps were considered, only that ``a number
of constructive proposals were worked out to ensure a fuller
utilisation of the possibilities of both republics to accelerate
the social, economic and cultural development of the
Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region.''

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran said
Tuesday his government won't agree to the direct peace negotiations
Iraq demands and an end to the 8-year-old war appears ``extremely
doubtful.''
   A spokesman for Javier Perez de Cuellar said the U.N.
secretary-general would not declare a cease-fire unilaterally,
which had appeared previously to be his intention. Iraq said it
would not accept the ``fait accompli'' of a unilateral declaration.
   Official news reports from Tehran said millions of people filled
streets of Iranian cities to show support for Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the 87-year-old patriarch of the fundamentalist Islamic
revolution.
   Khamenei said Iran would not accept preconditions for a truce
based on Resolution 598, which the U.N. Security Council passed
unanimously a year ago. Iraq said it would accept the resolution
soon after it was passed, but Iran did not do so until July 18.
   Iraq has launched several attacks in frontier areas since Iran
offered to accept the resolution, and insists on face-to-face talks
before a truce is declared.
   An Arab League committee trying to end the war met with high
Iraqi officials Tuesday in Baghdad.
   Perez de Cuellar said Monday he would announce a cease-fire
starting date after his fact-finding team returned from to U.N.
headquarters in New York this week from the Persian Gulf, adding
that it ``does not depend on the parties.''
   On Tuesday, however, spokesman Francois Giuliani said Perez de
Cuellar would consult the Security Council and possibly the two
belligerents before proclaiming a truce.
   ``It is not his intention to declare a cease-fire
unilaterally,'' Giuliani said. ``Theoretically he can do so.
Practically he will consult.''
   When he arrived at U.N. headquarters Tuesday, the
secretary-general told reporters: ``When I say I will declare a
cease-fire (in consultation) with members of the Security Council,
I do not exclude that I would be in touch with the two foreign
ministers.''
   Khameini said in a speech broadcast by Tehran radio: ``The Iraqi
regime's attitude during the past two weeks, its obstructionist
behavior regarding the implementation of Resolution 598 and its
excuses have cast doubts on the prospect of achieving peace.''
   ``In the light of this situation I look at the prospect of
achieving peace and an end to the war in the context of Resolution
598 as extremely doubtful and suspect.''
   He addressed a rally in Ahvaz as part of the celebrations
honoring Khomeini and the revolution that brought him to power in
1979. The president spoke in Arabic, the tongue of Iranians in
Ahvaz, the main city in the oil province of Khuzestan near the
Iraqi border.
   Iraqi newspapers have urged soldiers to keep their ``fingers on
the trigger,'' and Khamenei delivered a similar message.
   ``This enemy has proved that it understands nothing except the
language of force and of strength,'' he said. ``The armed forces
and everyone within the nation and volunteer combatants must
demonstrate and prove that the revolution, through its armed and
military forces, is always able to defend its borders.''
   ``Unless this is demonstrated this enemy will remain a constant
threat.'' About Iraq's demand for direct talks, he said:
   ``We shall not accept any preconditions from Iraq over the
implementation of the resolution and a cease-fire on the fronts ..
. such as direct negotiations or any other condition. If Iraq sets
down preconditions, we too shall set down a condition and ours will
be what we have stated before, the punishment of the aggressor.''
   During the year of Iran's holdout on the resolution, it insisted
there could be no truce until Iraq was branded as the aggressor.
Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border skirmishes.
   Resolution 598 provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to
recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an
investigation of which side started the war.
   Dispatches from Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said scenes in the streets Tuesday resembled the joy when Khomeini
returned from exile Feb. 1, 1979, after the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi was overthrown.
   Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's designated
successor, organized the rallies.
   In Tehran, participants assembled at the Azadi (Freedom Square)
to recite verses from the Koran, chant slogans and listen to a
resolution of support for Khomeini. Air force helicopters dropped
flowers, IRNA said.
   The resolution included vows to obey all Khomeini's orders,
recognize Montazeri as his successor, defend the Islamic
revolution, remain non-aligned and seek peace with Iraq.

<HEAD>Leading Indicator Report Signals Healthy Growth, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief barometer of future
economic activity soared 1.4 percent in June in a performance that
analysts said signaled healthy growth for the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the increase in its Index
of Leading Indicators was the sharpest rise in 18 months and
reflected healthy gains in virtually all of the statistics that
comprise it.
   In other good economic news, the government said sales of new
homes and orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods also
posted solid increases.
   The 5.5 percent rise in factory orders was the largest one-month
advance in more than 17 years and was propelled by the biggest
increase in military orders in more than five years.
   New-home sales shot up 8.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 734,000 units, the fastest sales rate in 16 months.
Analysts credited renewed consumer confidence for the rebound in
sales after a sluggish period earlier this spring.
   Analysts said the triple dose of strong economic statistics
should provide cheer for Republicans hoping to hold onto the White
House, although it is most certain to renew fears of higher
inflationary pressures in the months ahead.
   ``The leading index has been up in four of the last five months.
You have to consider that very good news for the economy,'' said
David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. ``
There is certainly no sign of a recession coming at least for the
rest of this year.''
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded
at a healthy 3.3 percent annual rate in the first six months of
1988, far better than economists had been expecting following last
October's stock market crash.
   Given the momentum provided by exceptionally strong activity in
June, many analysts said they expected growth in the current
July-September quarter to remain strong as well.
   The rapid economic growth helped to push the unemployment rate
down to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June, lending rise to
concerns that tight labor markets will begin to translate in higher
wage demands and rising inflation.
   ``We have an economy that is cooking along at or near full
employment. The byproduct of that is almost certain to be high and
accelerating inflation,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co. ``But these reports show that the end of the expansion
is not yet anywhere in sight.''
   Many analysts believe that higher inflationary pressures will
prompt the Federal Reserve Board to continue its efforts to boost
interest rates to dampen demand.
   The Fed, in a review of the economy released Tuesday, noted
rising prices for a wide variety of materials from metals and paper
to food. The report, prepared for Fed policymakers, said high
factory operating rates in many industries were beginning to bump
against capacity restraints.
   Many analysts say that while the economy will continue to grow
at a good clip this year, the Fed's efforts to fight inflationary
pressures could well result in a recession sometime in 1989.
   Analysts said the increase in the leading index was in part a
rebound from May, when the index had dropped a sharp 0.8 percent
after three months of solid gains. The June advance was the biggest
one-month rise since the index climbed 2.2 percent in December 1986.
   In June, the strength in the leading index was widespread, with
seven of the available nine components registering advances.
   The biggest source of strength came from a 5.7 percent rise in
stock prices as measured by the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's
index.
   Other business barometers showing strength were a slowdown in
business delivery times, considered a sign of increasing demand; an
increase in plant and equipment orders; a drop in unemployment
claims; an increase in building permits; a change in raw materials
prices and a rise in the money supply.
   One indicator, orders for consumer goods, was a negative factor
on the index; another indicator, the length of the average work
week, was unchanged in June.
   The 1.4 percent rise left the overall index at 194.0 percent of
its 1967 base of 100.

   The volume of world merchandise trade grew by 5
percent last year and is expected to rise by the same percentage in
1988, according to a study released Wednesday by the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The study by the international trading body paints a more upbeat
picture of the world economy than one issued in February that
estimated 4 percent growth in 1987 and 1988.
   Five consecutive years of growth have brought the volume of
world trade one-quarter above that in 1982, a recession year, the
study said.
   Trade in manufactures led the expansion with an estimated 5.5
percent increase in growth, exceeding the average annual increase
so far this decade, the study said.
   The report said agricultural trade volume ``turned in the best
performance since 1981,'' with 4.5 percent growth, compared with a
1 percent decline in 1986. The previous prediction was 4 percent.
   However, world agricultural output declined for the first time
since 1950, by an estimated 3 percent, largely because of high
levels of world stocks for major agricultural products, the report
said.
   The report also said that ``the pick-up in many agricultural
prices since the beginning of 1987 has done nothing to reduce the
urgent need for major reform in trade-related agricultural
policies'' which include trade-distorting measures such as
subsidies and market restrictions.
   Imports by industrialized countries remained the strongest force
in world trade expansion, though growth slowed to 6 percent from
8.5 percent in 1986, the report said.
   The volume of imports by developing countries increased by 3
percent last year after declining 5 percent in 1986, the report
said. Growth in those countries' exports dropped to 6 percent from
9 percent.
   For 15 heavily indebted developing countries, merchandise
exports in 1987 rebounded after dropping 15 percent in 1986, the
report said. It traced the recovery to firmer oil and metals
prices, and to increased manufactured exports.
   Imports by those countries _ Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, the
Philippines, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia _ rose by 7 percent
last year after stagnating from 1984 to 1986.

<TEXT>
   Divisions in its own ranks and
differences with the military over the communist insurgency have
weakened the ability of the Roman Catholic Church to influence a
government it helped catapult to power more than two years ago.
   In February 1986, priests and nuns heeded the call of Manila
Archbishop Cardinal Jaime L. Sin and poured into the streets to
support the military-civilian uprising that toppled President
Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Corazon Aquino into office.
   The church traditionally has played a strong role in the
Philippines, where more than 85 percent of the 59 million people
are Catholic. Priests in Asia's only Christian country still wield
considerable influence over the daily lives of parishoners.
   But the church now finds its influence on government policy
reduced, especially on the issue of the 19-year communist
insurgency.
   The ranks of Catholic clergy and laity are split between
staunchly anti-communist conservatives and those who support many
of the proclaimed reformist goals of the rebels.
   The military has accused many priests and nuns of actively
supporting the those fighting for the communist New People's Army.
Despite the anti-communist stands of Sin and others, priests from
the communist-dominated Christians for National Liberation lead
guerrilla units.
   Meanwhile, military influence over the government has grown
steadily in the wake of a half-dozen coup attempts put down by
loyal members of the armed forces.
   The clearest sign of the church's declining influence on
official policy has been Mrs. Aquino's response to a call by the
Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines for a resumption of
peace talks with the rebel National Democratic Front.
   Last month, the 115-member conference called for a restart of
peace negotiations, which collapsed in January 1987. Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos has opposed peace talks, saying they would
only serve to give the rebels a propaganda forum.
   Mrs. Aquino, herself a Catholic, made no reference to the
bishops' call in last month's ``state of the nation address,'' in
which she outlined her agenda for the coming year.
   Instead, she said the rebels' refusal to lay down their arms had
given her government the ``moral basis'' for war. Mrs. Aquino said
earlier she was amenable to new talks but the rebels must make the
first move.
   The bishops' call for talks with the insurgests ``reflects the
growing falling out by the Church with the Aquino government,''
columnist Amando Doronila said in a commentary in The Manila
Chronicle newspaper. He said the bishops' position is ``certain to
put pressure on the government to reassess its relationship with
the church, one of Mrs. Aquino's most powerful allies in the
struggle to overthrow the Marcos regime,'' Doronila said.
   Rep. Venancio Garduce, former attorney for the conference's
National Secretariat for Social Action, blamed the decline of the
church's influence on the inability of its collective leadership to
assert a strong, unified position on key issues.
   Despite its size, however, the church has been unable to forge a
common stand on many issues because it lacks a clearly acknowledged
leader. Each diocese technically is independent and answerable only
to the Vatican.
   In the May 1987 Senate elections, Sin urged voters to reject
leftist candidates whom he branded as ``lepers'' and openly
endorsed 11 other candidates, angering some bishops as well as
influential laymen.
   In the same election, Garduce noted that the bishops' conference
lobbied for enactment of a far-reaching land reform bill proposed
last year in the House of Representatives.
   Many prominent legislators, including Mrs. Aquino's brother,
Rep. Jose Cojuangco, opposed the House measure. Instead, the House
and Senate in June approved a compromise version, which church
leaders still accepted.
   ``(The church) can always adapt,'' Garduce said. ``It is too
compromising.''
   Garduce said the bishops, concerned over the government's
deference to the military, backed out of supporting the original
land reform bill because of army allegations that the church had
been infiltrated by the communists.
   Last year, the military charged that the church's social action
secretariat, which coordinates welfare programs, was diverting
funds to the New People's Army.
   After an investigation, the bishops decided to reorganize the
secretariat.
   ``The church should be liberational in its approach,'' Garduce
said. ``But then the institutional church probably is aware that
there will be problems in case this thrust will be continued.''
   Some bishops have complained that the military often charges
Catholic clergy with supporting the rebels simply because of their
work with the poor.
   ``We regret that our people who are engaged in the work for
Philippine Christian communities or social action work are
suspected sometimes,'' Manila Bishop Teodoro Bacani said after a
recent meeting with military authorities.

   A senior Iraqi official said today his
government would never accept a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war if
it were declared by the U.N. without Iraq's consent.
   Riyadh al-Qaysi, Iraq's former U.N. ambassador, also told
reporters, ``We demand face-to-face talks in the interest of real
peace, rather than a temporary truce.''
   ``We will not accept a fait accompli, no matter in what form or
from which quarter it comes,'' said Al-Qaysi, a member of the Iraqi
delegation in the current U.N. peace talks with the foreign
ministers of Iran and Iraq.
   On Monday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he
would declare a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war after receiving
the report from a U.N. cease-fire team and consulting the Security
Council. The U.N. chief said he also might consult with
representatives of Iran and Iraq.
   ``The D-Day (beginning of a cease-fire) does not depend on the
parties,'' the secretary-general said.
   His statement fueled speculation that he was trying to pressure
Iraq to drop its demand for face-to-face talks before a cease-fire
and to agree to an early peace. Iran has been pressing Perez de
Cuellar to announce a cease-fire and has said it will comply at
once.
   Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati of Iran reaffirmed today
that his government believes the secretary-general is obliged to
declare a cease-fire, even if Iraq is opposed.
   ``The secretary-general is mandated to declare a cease-fire,''
he told reporters after meeting with some members of the Security
Council. He said Iran accepts the secretary-general's ideas on a
troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and other elements of a peace
plan.
   Earlier today, Francois Giuliani, spokesman for the
secretary-general, said the U.N. chief does not intend to act
unilaterally. ``It is not his intention to declare a cease-fire
unilaterally,'' Giuliani said. ``Theoretically he can do so,
practically he will consult.''
   No meetings were scheduled today between the secretary-general
and Iranian or Iraqi envoys.
   Iran's announcement on July 18 that it was finally accepting a
year-old U.N. cease-fire resolution came after it suffered a string
of battlefield defeats, and was followed by a series of Iraqi raids
into Iran.
   Iraq accepted the cease-fire resolution last year, but has been
demanding face-to-face talks with Iran before a truce takes effect.
   The announcement of a cease-fire date would put pressure on Iraq
to compromise and drop its insistence on direct talks, which have
hampered a week of U.N.-mediated negotiations between the warring
nations.
   The Security Council resolution provides for a cease-fire,
withdrawal to recognized borders, a prisoner exchange, peace
negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started
the war.
   Perez de Cuellar said a U.N. military team is now in Amman,
Jordan, preparing its report. He said he is to receive it on
Wednesday.
   ``I will be in touch with members of the (Security) Council and
then I will decide on a D-Day,'' the Peruvian said.
   The secretary-general said that once a date for a cease-fire is
decided, he will begin consulting nations that could provide about
250 military observers to monitor the truce and troop withdrawal.
   Perez de Cuellar on Monday held his sixth meeting with Velayati
since talks began last week. He has met three times with Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq.

<HEAD>Friend Took Mahoney's Keys Away, Then Returned Them</HEAD>

   A friend of the man charged in a church
bus crash that killed 27 people testified Tuesday that he took the
driver's pickup truck keys away before the accident but returned
them because ``he wasn't drunk enough that he couldn't drive.''
   ``I had ridden with him earlier that night,'' added Taylor Fox,
who was at a friend's house with Larry Mahoney before the accident.
``He told me he was going home.''
   But when he watched Mahoney leave, Fox recalled, Mahoney drove
past the turn to his house.
   Fox was among the first witnesses at the hearing by the National
Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the May 14
crash. NTSB officials have said the hearing will focus mainly on
drunken driving and bus safety.
   NTSB Chairman James Burnett, interviewed Tuesday on NBC's ``The
Today Show,'' said the licenses of drunken drivers should be
revoked on their first offense ``through a speedy process rather
than through a process that's severely delayed and the judicial
system.''
   Asked Tuesday whether he would have done anything differently,
Fox said, ``I would have kept his keys ... but you can't predict''
that type of accident.
   Both Fox and Phil Downey, who was also at the house with
Mahoney, said Mahoney was holding a beer when he pulled up to the
house a few hours before the crash.
   Downey said Mahoney apparently ``had had a few,'' but added, ``I
wouldn't say he was drunk.''
   An expert on the effects of drinking and driving, however,
testified that Mahoney's blood-alcohol level of .26 percent _ more
than 2{ times the legal limit in Kentucky _ would have ``massively
impaired'' his driving ability.
   ``I would estimate that he drank about a case ... 24 cans'' of
beer, said Dr. Herbert Moskowitz of the Southern California Researh
Institute.
   Mahoney, 35, has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder, 13
counts of first-degree assault, 44 counts of first-degree wanton
endangerment and one count of drunken driving.
   The crash was the deadliest involving an allegedly drunken
driver, according to the NTSB.
   A third witness, Clint Bradley, who was heading south to
Louisville shortly before the accident, said he saw Mahoney pass
him going south on I-71. He said Mahoney's truck was weaving and
tailgating a tractor-trailer rig.
   Bradley got off the interstate at a Carrollton exit to buy some
cigarettes. When he returned to the highway, he said, Mahoney was
heading north in the southbound lane.
   Bradley said he flashed his lights and honked his horn at him.
   The NTSB will report on the crash's probable causes and
recommend how to avoid similar accidents. Recommendations could be
directed toward federal, state and local officials, as well as bus
manufacturers, but the board has no power to require implementation.
   Since the crash, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson ordered officers
enforcing the state's liquor laws to increase inspections of bars,
liquor stores and other establishmentsd that sell alcoholic
beverages to intoxicated customers.

<HEAD>President Endorses Payment to Interned Japanese-Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Tuesday endorsed
compromise legislation providing compensation payments of $20,000
to Americans of Japanese descent who were interned during World War
II, saying the bill ``will close a sad chapter in American
history.''
   The administration had previously objected to some features of
the bill, but Reagan said the version approved by a House-Senate
conference committee and passed last Wednesday by the Senate ``is
substantially improved over the versions previously considered.''
   The House is scheduled to vote on the measure Wednesday.
   In a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and House
Republican Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill, the president said, ``We
are particularly pleased that the bill provides for a measured
disbursement of the amounts authorized for the trust fund.''
   The compromise sets disbursement of the tax-free payments over a
10-year period, for a total cost of more than $1 billion. Of the
120,000 people of Japanese ancestry detained during the war, about
60,000 are still alive and eligible for the payments.
   Reagan said the administration was also glad to see that the
bill ``ensures that acceptance of compensation under the
legislation fully satisifies claims against the United States based
on the unique circumstances of the internment.''
   Enactment of the bill, he said, ``will close a sad chapter in
American history in a way that reaffirms America's commitment to
the preservaion of liberty and justice for all.''

   The PLO will convene a special session of
its parliament to discuss King Hussein's decision to cut Jordan's
legal and administrative links with the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Also on Tuesday, Egypt called for Jordan and the Palestine
Liberation Organization to coordinate their efforts to achieve
peace in the Middle East.
   A statement issued in Cairo by Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Hussein's announcement Sunday did not mean Jordan
was abandoning its role in the quest for a Palestinian settlement.
   ``The advancement of the peace process ... requires a unified
Arab front based primarily on effective Jordanian-Palestinian
coordination,'' the statement said.
   The director of the PLO's Baghdad office, Azzam al-Ahmad, said
the organization's Central Council called for a meeting of the
400-plus member National Council within a month. The decision was
made during two days of meetings in Baghdad.
   The last National Council session, held in Algeria, came late
last year before the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The Central Council is the upper branch of the
bicameral National Council.
   Hussein said he was cutting ties with Palestinians in the West
Bank because the PLO should be primarily responsible for them.
   The PLO has been leading the uprising in Israel's occupied
lands. Most of the 850,000 Palestinians in the West Bank have
Jordanian passports, use Jordanian money and worship in
Jordanian-supported mosques.
   The Israelis do not recognize the PLO, but moderates among them
have expressed a willingness to talk peace with a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   PLO officials said PLO chief Yasser Arafat has ordered PLO
officials not to make any public comment on Hussein's action until
the Executive Committee, which serves as a Cabinet, can review the
possible consequences.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

   Producers and scriptwriters have approached
each other informally after management's chief negotiator declared
a deadlock in bargaining to end a crippling 22-week-old walkout, a
union spokeswoman said.
   The formal talks collapsed Saturday, but intermediaries made
contact to determine if a basis existed to resume negotiations,
Writers Guild of America spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said Monday.
   ``We are attempting to get the talks going,'' Ms. Rhoden said.
   She said ``a variety of resources'' were being used to
accomplish that, but she declined to identify the go-betweens.
   The informal contacts spurred optimism among some at guild
headquarters Monday afternoon that a settlement with the Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers might be near, said two
sources within the guild.
   Federally mediated talks had ended early Saturday after
foundering on issues including payments for television reruns. On
Sunday, the alliance's chief negotiator and president, Nicholas
Counter III, declared the contract talks ``hopelessly deadlocked.''
   The 9,000-member guild blamed the collapse of formal
negotiations on the alliance, while producers have charged the
guild with making unreasonable demands and refusing to compromise.
   The guild's main negotiator, meanwhile, asked dissident guild
members to give him until Wednesday to resolve the strike,
according to another guild source. The sources spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Brian Walton, executive director of the guild on the West Coast,
made the request Monday to members who were considering resigning,
the source said.
   Walton spoke by telephone to the Writers Coalition group, said
Ms. Rhoden, who refused to disclose details of the conversation.
   The coalition of 21 writers has pushed for a strike settlement
under contract terms that the guild has strongly opposed.
   The group had threatened to drop out of the strike in the past
and was expected to resign from the guild this week. After a
four-hour strategy conference Monday, the coalition announced it
would continue to honor the walkout that began March 7.
   But the dissidents will reconsider whether they should resign if
the strike continues past week's end, said Lionel Chetwynd, a
spokesman for the coalition.
   Also Monday, officials of the Walt Disney and 20th Century Fox
film studios said Monday that their companies will pay any union
fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who cross pick lines.
   Jeffrey Katzenberg and Barry Diller, the respective heads of
Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox, made the offers. Fox
spokesman Michael Binkow confirmed Diller's offer. Katzenberg's
proposal was reported in today's editions of The New York Times.
   Guild fines against strike-breaking writers are set at 110
percent of all compensation received for unauthorized strike work,
and violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild, Ms.
Rhoden said.
   She said that she knew of no movement within union ranks to
accept the proposal.

<HEAD>Fires Hurt Yellowstone's Tourism, Help Habitat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This summer's wildfires
are exciting scientists over the prospect of a wilderness
laboratory, while dismaying tourism officials faced with fewer
visitors to the oldest national park.
   The fires also have touched off a lively debate about how much
man should interfere with nature's ways in the West.
   ``There is a great scientific interest in this because there
will be a tremendous release of forage and habitat for wildlife,''
Yellowstone Superintendent Robert Barbee said Tuesday. ``On the
other hand, if you are making your living on tourism ... you don't
want to impede tourism to the area.''
   ``That's the horns of our dilemma,'' Barbee said.
   Indeed, while scientists wait eagerly to reach charred
backcountry areas to study the effects of the park's most
extraordinary fire assault in three centuries, Wyoming and
Yellowstone officials are trying to get the word out that the park
remains open.
   Most fires, they emphasize, are burning in the park's
backcountry and only two front-country areas, the Grant Village
complex and Lewis Lake campground near the park's south entrance,
have been closed by the fire.
   ``Yellowstone is keeping a relatively normal operation, although
we have minor disruptions from time to time,'' Barbee said. ``We
have thousands of people here, the hotels are full, the campgrounds
are full and people haven't left yet.''
   Fires that have burned in the park since June now involve some
140,000 acres, although not all of the land within fire lines has
burned, creating a mosaic of burned and unburned areas.
   ``And that's the way these forests have already proceeded,''
said Barbee. ``The fire process has always played itself this way
throughout the West.''
   ``It's a rebirth,'' said John Varley, park biologist. ``One of
the public perceptions that's hard to deal with is all this talk of
destruction, devastation and damage.
   ``To the ecologist, those are all inappropriate terms. It is
really rebirth and renewal. It is the end of one cycle of life and
the beginning of the next,'' Varley said.
   Such fires eliminate old underbrush and stimulate new growth
while clearing land for wildlife forage.
   ``What is left behind is a rich mosaic of old growth and new
growth,'' Barbee said. ``What occurs then is a whole host of
different organisms are on the scene. It will be black this year,
next year it will be a carpet of green. It is opening habitat that
has been closed for a couple of hundred years.
   ``It is all part of this dynamic process that occurs in nature.
So what is destruction for one person is a reason for champagne
corks to pop for the next.''
   Nevertheless, publicity generated by the blazes is discouraging
some tourists, according to Wyoming Travel Commission Director Gene
Bryan.
   ``I don't think there is any question the fires are beginning to
have an impact,'' he said. ``Initially, with those folks who were
already on the road and still planning to go, it didn't seem to
have any immediate impact. We are beginning to feel it now in some
key areas.''
   Yellowstone tourism surveys show that when the South Entrance
closed July 23 the park's overall visitation dropped about 20
percent from 1987 levels.
   To combat the perception that the park and northwestern Wyoming
are inaccessible, the Travel Commission is running 60-second radio
advertisements in Salt Lake City, Omaha, Neb., and Des Moines,
Iowa, to announce that the park's major facilities and attractions
are open.
   The commission has also asked Wyoming's congressional delegation
to consider taping public service announcements and to ask
President Reagan to tape one as well.
   Some groups are taking exception to contentions by the U.S.
Forest Service and Park Service that the fires are good for the
area.
   A number of people have criticized both agencies for their
policy of allowing naturally caused fires to burn, particularly in
the park and in the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   However, because of this summer's extremely dry conditions, the
agencies are fighting most new fires regardless of how they started.
   Park policies do allow for a change in the practice of allowing
natural fires to burn depending on the conditions, a point Keith
Hamilton, a Wyoming Farm Bureau official in Big Horn County, finds
difficult to understand.
   ``(Park and forest) officials have been telling the public they
feel fires are a natural occurrence and should be allowed to
burn,'' Hamilton said. ``But for some strange reason, they place
several hundred firefighters on the line. Their real policy is
still a mystery. I think they would like to have their cake and eat
it, too.''

<HEAD>Worker Gets Back Pay, New Job After Taking 20-Ton Loader As Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A construction worker who took home a
20 ton front-loader worth $125,000 after he failed to get his
paycheck has collected his pay and gotten a job with another
company.
   When James Artie Flanagan, a heavy-equipment operator for a
Tampa company, was told Friday that an accounting mistake would
delay his pay for work on a project at Jacksonville International
Airport, he rode off on his machine.
   Flanagan, 41, said Monday that he took the front-end loader home
to Yulee because he worried he wouldn't get his next check either.
   ``They (company officials) said, `Maybe Monday.' And I said,
`I'll just take this and you'll get it back Monday _ maybe.'''
   He said he was warned last week that he would be arrested on
grand theft charges when he returned to work, but he said his boss
with Parking Lot Striping Service Inc. of Tampa told him that
charges will not be pressed.
   The front-loader was seized by Nassau County authorities Friday
night and returned to Parking Lot Striping.
   News coverage of the dispute led to job offers, and Flanagan
said he will start work as a welder later this month in West Palm
Beach.
   ``It was two weeks' pay. Six hundred dollars, when you've been
out of work six weeks, is a lot of money,'' he said.

<HEAD>Retarded Man, Missing For 17 Years, To Be Reunited With Sister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 17 years hitchhiking across the
country, panhandling for food and living in shelters and a mental
hospital, a 51-year-old retarded man has found his family.
   ``It's a miracle,'' said Frank Caswell, who has been a patient
at Eastern State Hospital since last November. He had no
identification, money or additional clothes when a mission for the
homeless in Norfolk sent him to Eastern.
   Caswell was unable to tell workers at the hospital his hometown
until last month, when he said he may have lived in Dover, N.H. He
told social worker Martin Phillips he thought he had a sister who
was still alive.
   PNo one would miss me anyway,'' Caswell said Monday. But he
said he was eager to return to New Hampshire and promised never to
leave again.
   Caswell's memory loss and an unusual limp had led hospital
workers to believe he had been a chronic alcoholic. Actually, the
limp came from his contracting polio in 1949.
   The challenge of piecing together his past had been made more
difficult by false leads he gave the hospital. He guessed his age
to be about 40 and came up with inaccurate names of relatives.
   Phillips said officials hope Caswell can return to New Hampshire
and be reunited with his sister in the next two months.
   ``Basically, for the last 17 years, he has been a mystery man,''
Phillips said.

<HEAD>Reagan Relents, Will Let Plant Closing Bill Become Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Tuesday he will
reluctantly allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law
and accused Democrats of ``political shenanigans'' that had
jeopardized legislation aimed at curbing the huge U.S. trade
deficit.
   Without relenting in his view that requiring 60 days' notice of
plant closings or mass layoffs was wrong, Reagan conceded that
political realities rendered a veto of the bill impractical.
   ``The Senate leadership refuses to even consider important trade
legislation until final action is taken on the plant-closing
bill,'' he said.
   Reagan and his chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, accused
pro-labor Democrats in Congress of exploiting public sentiment for
a plant-closing bill to force the administration's hand.
   ``But the national interest now dictates that the majority in
the Congress must be forced to stop playing politics,'' Reagan said.
   ``Therefore, in order to end these political shenanigans and to
get on with the business of the nation, I have decided to allow the
plant closing bill to become law _ but without my signature.''
   The bill becomes law at 12:01 a.m. EDT Thursday, but it will not
be enforced for six months, until Feb. 4, 1989.
   Vice President George Bush's staff chief, Craig Fuller, said
Reagan's decision ``will make it more difficult for the political
game to be played over the plant-closing issue'' in the November
presidential election.
   Bush, the certain Republican presidential nominee, has opposed
mandatory plant-closing notices. Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis
has repeatedly cited Bush's position as evidence of his and
Reagan's insensitivity to workers.
   Under the bill, notices are required of any employer with at
least 100 full-time workers if a plant closing will result in loss
of jobs for 50 or more of employees.
   In case of layoffs, notices are required only if one-third of a
company's employees or 500 of them _ whichever figure is lower _
are involved.
   Exemptions are provided if employers can show that plant
closings or mass layoffs are caused by ``not reasonably foreseeable
circumstances'' such as flood, drought or sudden cancellation of a
major contract, or that notices would prevent raising enough
capital to keep the business open.
   The president had vetoed an earlier version of the trade bill
largely because it included a plant-closing provision, and his veto
was upheld. But the House and Senate subsequently passed separate
plant-closing legislation by veto-proof margins.
   Thus, Reagan abandoned the fight Tuesday in the face of
virtually certain defeat in Congress. A veto became untenable when
Republicans deserted Reagan apparently because of polls which
showed that 80 percent of the public favored plant-closing notices.
   Fifty-four of the 177 Republicans in the House and 19 GOP
senators supported the bill last month, enough to muster the
two-thirds majorities in each chamber to override a veto.
   Fitzwater chided Democrats for turning the bill into a
``political football,'' and Reagan said some legislators were
``more interested in scoring political points with organized labor
than in saving workers' jobs.''
   But Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., dissented. ``The president's
done the right thing although I wish he had done it sooner,'' she
said.
   ``It became an election year issue of fairness and
compasssion,'' said Mrs. Roukema, who had led a GOP fight against
the bill in the House but wound up supporting it.
   ``The heat of the summer is not the only heat the White House
has been feeling,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va. ``The president has felt the heat from working Americans
who want fair treatment and common decency.''
   The bill's enactment is organized labor's biggest legislative
victory since 1978, when Congress last voted to raise the minimum
wage.
   ``Workers, their families and their communities will now have a
better chance to plan for the future,'' said AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland, who called Reagan's decision ``long in coming but
welcome.''
   The National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce had engaged in aggressive grass-roots lobbying over the
past two weeks to pressure Reagan to veto the bill.
   ``This has really sent a shock wave through the business
community,'' said Renee Reymond, the NAM's chief lobbyist on the
issue.
   She said the plant-closing notices wee ``part of a broad scheme
to get many mandated benefits enacted into law instead of through
the collective bargaining process so that unions can bargain for
other things.''
   A Bureau of Labor Statistics study last year indicated that 64
percent of the workers affected by plant closings or large-scale
layoffs received no advance notice and that another 16 percent were
told less than two weeks in advance.
   Supporters of the legislation said it would provide notices to
800,000 workers, most of them non-union, who do not receive advance
warnings as part of collective bargaining contracts.

   A Balkan Bulgarian airlines jet crashed
shortly after taking off from Sofia on Tuesday, killing 23 people
and injuring 14, the official Bulgarian news agency said.
   Bulgarian airport officials reached by telephone from Vienna
confirmed the crash, but refused to give details.
   The Yak-40, a Soviet-built plane with three engines, crashed at
5:29 p.m. (10:29 a.m. EDT) at the start of a 280-mile scheduled
flight from the Bulgarian capital to Varna on the Black Sea coast.
   The plane carried 33 passengers and four crew members, BTA said.
It did not say whether any foreigners were aboard.
   It said 14 people were hospitalized ``for emergency treatment.
The rest were killed in the crash,'' BTA said.
   The agency said a commission had been appointed to investigate
the crash.
   The accident was believed to be the worst Bulgarian air disaster
since the crash of Bulgarian airliner that was preparing to land in
Sofia in 1984. All 50 people on board were killed in that accident,
involving a Tu-134 jet.
   In 1978, a Balkan Bulgarian plane en route from Sofia to Warsaw
crashed and killed 73 people.

   U.S. Rep. Edolphus Towns took a firm stand
against crime Tuesday _ he nabbed a suspected burglar on the roof
of his home, told him not to move or ``I'm going to break your
legs,'' and used a tree limb to keep him cornered until police came.
   ``I was just so angry about the whole thing, I just didn't think
it through,'' Towns said. ``I just didn't want him to get away.''
   ``I don't recommend that people do this, but I guess it was just
instinct,'' Towns said in a telephone interview from his office in
Washington.
   Towns, D-N.Y., was at his Brooklyn home Tuesday when a man
allegedly entered through a second-floor bedroom window.
   ``I heard the noise, went into the room and saw him, then I
yelled,'' Towns said. The would-be burglar tried to climb back out
the window, and Towns reached out and unsuccessfully ``tried to
grab his leg.''
   Towns, 54, raced from the house and waited near his garage while
the burglar jumped from the roof.
   Armed with a tree limb, Towns told the man, ``Don't get up, if
you do I'm going to break your legs,'' he said. The congressman's
wife called police, who arrived a short time later.
   ``I'm just so sick and tired and fed up with crime,'' he said.
``We have to do everything we possibly can to eliminate crime.''
   The man, who was not armed, was charged with burglary and
criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Police said he would not
give his name.

<HEAD>Say Six of Seven Safety Hazards Corrected at Henderson Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials at Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp.
say they have corrected six of the seven safety hazards cited by
state officials last month at their Henderson plant.
   Spokeswoman Annita Bridges said the company is appealing the one
citation that has not been corrected. She confirmed that citation
involves storing ammonium perchlorate, a rocket fuel oxidizer, on
asphalt pads. Ms. Bridges said she does not know why the state
opposes the asphalt pads.
   Fines for the Kerr-McGee citations exceed $5,200, according to
federal records.
   The seven citations were issued by the Nevada Division of
Occupational Safety and Health and disclosed last week by company
officials.
   Ms. Bridges said the citations were issued following inspections
made at a time when the plant was not in operation.
   Kerr-McGee shut down production for a period following an
explosion at the nearby PEPCON plant, the only other facility in
the country producing the critical oxidizer used in the space
shuttle and military rockets.
   Kerr-McGee resumed production following a series of inspections
by safety officials.
   PEPCON announced last week it will build a new plant in Cedar
City, Utah.
   The May 4 explosion killed two people, injured 326 and caused
$73 million in property damage.

<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes surged 8.4 percent in June
as rising mortgage rates spurred the biggest increase in sales in
four months, the government reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 734,000 units in
June, the highest sales level since February 1987.
   The June increase followed a revised 0.6 percent decline in home
sales in May and was the biggest one-month advance since an 11.9
percent sale rise in February. The government also revised upward
the level of sales for March, April and May, showing more strength
in the residential market than previously believed.
   Analysts said these developments were encouraging signs, but
they cautioned against too much optimism, primarily because of a
belief that mortgage rates are headed still higher.
   ``Demand is still there as long as interest rates can stay at a
reasonable level,'' said Kent Colton, executive vice president of
the National Association of Realtors. ``But we are concerned that
for the rest of the year, the pressure on rates will be upward.
That means that this is probably the peak as far as sales are
concerned.''
   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said part of the sales push in June came from attempts
by home buyers to close deals before rates went higher.
   Peach noted that the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates
twice in May and once in June in highly publicized moves to dampen
inflationary pressures.
   Fixed-rate mortgages now stand at 10.5 percent on average. James
Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, predicted they would hit 11 percent by the end of the
year.
   But even with the continued rise in rates, Christian predicted
that new-home sales would total 650,000 units this year, down only
3 percent from the 1987 pace.
   ``The upward revisions in sales back through March indicate the
housing market was doing pretty well through the spring,'' he said.
``People have confidence that the economy will remain strong and
they don't have to worry about going out and making a commitment to
buy a home.''
   Prices of new homes were up sharply in June, with the median
price at $117,800, up $7,800 from May. The median price means half
the homes sold for more and half for less.
   The average price of a home was up as well, climbing 5.7 percent
to $141,200.
   Analysts said much of the price increase reflected the
geographic composition of the sales increase. Sales were up sharply
in the Northeast and West, the two regions with the highest home
prices.
   The sales advance was led by a 28.9 percent rise in the West,
where sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 245,000
units. Sales in the Northeast climbed 15.5 percent to 119,000 units.
   Sales fell 4.2 percent in the South to an annual rate of 273,000
units. Sales were down 1 percent in the Midwest to a rate of 97,000
units.
   For the first six months of the year, new-home sales were 3.2
percent lower than in the same period a year ago.

   The higher postage stamp prices that took
effect April 3 boosted the Postal Service out of the red, the
agency reported Tuesday.
   The mail service said it had net income of $48 million for the
quarter between March 12 and June 3. In the same quarter a year
earlier, the agency had lost $171 million.
   Senior Assistant Postmaster General Comer S. Coppie said
quarterly revenue was 1.6 percent higher than expected, primarily
because the new rates took effect a week earlier than originally
planned and mail volume was higher than anticipated.
   In addition, the Postal Service received $10 million in
unplanned revenues for nationwide delivery of an AIDS pamphlet from
the U.S. Surgeon General.

   The countdown for a Thursday
test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's main engines proceeded
Tuesday while technicians searched seals, fittings and welds for an
elusive hydrogen leak that could once again delay the vital test.
   Shuttle managers said they hoped to avoid a fifth postponement
of a test which is necessary to certify Discovery for the first
shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion 2{ years ago.
   They said they would meet Wednesday morning to assess the leak
situation and decide whether to continue or delay the countdown.
   The problem is in a launch pad service mast and not on the
shuttle itself.
   Officials said there were indications the leak could be
temperature related and occur only when hydrogen flowed through the
service mast into the shuttle's fuel tank at a temperature of 423
degrees below zero, necessary to keep it in liquid form.
   If that were the case, the leak might be difficult to find at
air temperature and suspect parts might have to be removed and
subjected to tests in a supercold laboratory chamber.
   The leak is in the same service mast as another hydrogen leak
that developed last Friday in a pressure monitoring connector. That
leak was fixed, but it forced a three-day delay in a practice
countdown.
   The new leak, believed different than the first, was detected
Monday while hydrogen was flowing into Discovery's tanks during a
renewed practice countdown. The launch team stopped hydrogen
loading and continued the countdown to conclusion without a full
load.
   A new countdown then was started, aiming for the firing of
Discovery's three main engines at 7:30 a.m. Thursday.
   The 20-second ignition is to test modifications made to
highspeed turbopumps and other engine systems and to provide the
launch team with practice in new countdown procedures initiated
since the Challenger accident.
   Officials believe the practice countdown and firing delays,
combined with an unresolved leak in the spaceship's steering
thruster system, could slip the launch date from mid-September into
October.
   NASA has deferred action on the steering thruster leak until
after the engine test. Then shuttle managers will determine whether
to move Discovery from the launch pad to a hangar for repairs or if
engineers should try to fix the leak on the pad by entering the
shuttle's cargo bay and cutting a hole through the rear bulkhead to
gain access to the thruster compartment.
   A fix on the pad would delay the launch about two weeks, while
moving Discovery to a hangar could put it off as much as two months.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian who testified at
the trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi on Tuesday was the second witness
to link the defendant to the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner to
Beirut.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 1985
commandeering of Trans World Airlines Flight 847 to the Lebanese
capital.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger read from a police report in
which Hazma Kassin, a Palestinian, recounted a conversation with
Hamadi's older brother, Abbas.
   Abbas was convicted in April of kidnapping two West Germans in
Beirut in an attempt to force West Germany to free his younger
brother. Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   One West German, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September, but
the second, Rudolf Cordes, remains a hostage.
   Quoting the police report, Mueckenberger told Kassim: ``You told
police, `Abbas told me that Mohammed was arrested because he was a
hijacker of the American airplane. Abbas said Mohammed is to be
extradited to the United States. Abbas didn't say how he knew about
this, but I assume that he had heard it from Mohammed.'''
   Kassim responded: ``It could be that I told that to the police.''
   ``Are you afraid to repeat it?'' Mueckenberger asked.
   ``No, but I can't remember now,'' Kassim said in the heavily
guarded courtroom.
   Kassim said he lived in Lebanon before coming to Germany in
1979. He now lives in the town of Merzig in Saarland state, near
the former residence of Abbas Hamadi.
   Mueckenberger said police questioned Kassim after Mohammed
Hamadi's arrest in January 1987, but did not specify the date.
   Last week, Gaazi Yazbeck, a Lebanese man who lives in West
Germany and knows the Hamadis, said Abbas told him that Mohammed
had ``something to do'' with the hijacking.
   ``He (Abbas) just said it, he was sort of bragging,'' Yazbeck
told the court. He said the conversation occurred at a bar in
Saarland state a few weeks after the hijacking.
   Mohammed Hamadi, who lived in West Germany from 1982 to 1984,
has not been asked directly about the hijacking.
   Court spokesman Falk Thomas told reporters Tuesday that pilots
of the hijacked jet are scheduled to testify in September.
   Flight 847 was seized after taking off from Athens on June 14,
1985, and diverted to Beirut. The gunmen killed U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem and held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days.
   Three other men who were allegedly involved in the hijacking
remain at large.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,
1987, after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his
luggage.
   In a brief exchange Tuesday, Mueckenberger asked Hamadi if he
had been sick. The defendant responded: ``I don't want to discuss
this in public.''
   Thomas later said Hamadi has been ill and requested hospital
treatment when the court recesses for four weeks on Aug. 9. He
declined to specify the nature of the illness.

   Thirteen people died and 18 were
injured when a passenger bus slammed into a truck that has just
overturned on a highway early Tuesday, Federal Highway Police said.
   Ricardo Rijoas, a highway police spokesman, said 11 people died
at the scene and two more died in a hospital in San Luis Potosi,
capital of the north central state of the same name. The dead
included the bus driver, Riojas said.
   The accident took place on the San Luis Potosi-Queretaro highway
37 miles south of San Luis Potosi. The city is 334 miles north of
Mexico City.
   Highway police said the speeding trailer truck had overturned
only moments before the Omnibus del Jorullo bus came down the
highway. They said the truck driver abandoned his rig and has not
been found.
   The impact threw the bus against an embankment, they said.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods advanced in June at the fastest rate in more than 17 years, a
5.5 percent increase that reflected strong demand for civilian and
military aircraft, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods hit a record $229.84 billion in June following a
0.7 percent decline in May.
   It was the biggest one-month increase since a 6.8 percent rise
in December 1970 and left economists impressed with the continued
showing of strength by American manufacturing.
   ``Even after you take out defense and civilian aircraft, it was
a very nice number,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist
for Data Resources Inc. ``The manufacturing sector is now
competitive in world markets.''
   American manufacturers suffered through lean years earlier in
the decade because of a huge trade deficit caused by shrinking
export sales and a big surge in imports. The administration
launched an effort in 1985 to devalue the dollar as a way of making
imports more expensive and boosting the competitiveness of U.S.
goods overseas.
   ``The June orders report is another indication that the
industrial side of the economy is close to a boom,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The strength and
momentum in orders suggests that the capital spending boom we have
had will keep going though the rest of the year.''
   Much of the overall strength in the economy in the first half of
1988 has come from the improvement in the trade deficit and a big
rise in business investment as manufacturers expanded production
facilities to meet the rising export demand.
   The June orders increase came from a $10.1 billion rise in
transportation orders, which jumped to $38.2 billion, 35.9 percent
over the May level. The increase included a $5.2 billion rise in
demand for military aircraft and a $4.6 billion rise in
shipbuilding and tanks.
   Overall, the volatile defense category shot up 78.6 percent, the
biggest increase since December 1982. Without the rise in military
demand, total orders would have risen by a smaller, but still
healthy, 2.7 percent.
   The category of non-defense capital goods rose 13.2 percent to
$35.76 billion, reflecting in large part the increase in civilian
aircraft orders, most placed with the Seattle-based Boeing Co.
   Total orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or
more years, rose 9.4 percent to $125.9 billion. This represented a
slight upward revision from an advance report a week ago that put
the increase in durable goods at 8.8 percent.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel fell by 3.3 percent, the
only major sector to post a decline during the month.
   Orders for non-durable goods rose 1.2 percent to $104.03
billion, reflecting increases in demand for food, clothing, paper
and petroleum products.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 1.5 percent in June to
$220.6 billion, with over half of that increase coming in the
durable goods sector.

<HEAD>South Africa Proposes Cease-Fire in Angolan War, Withdrawal from
Namibia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa on Tuesday
proposed a cease-fire next month in the Angolan war that would lead
to a withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and independence for
South-West Africa by next June.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, speaking in the capital of Pretoria,
said South African delegates made the offer Tuesday in Geneva,
where a new round of peace talks began.
   The talks involve South Africa, Angola, Cuba and U.S. mediators.
   The proposal marked the first time South Africa has offered a
specific date for granting independence to South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia, and was seen as a major development in efforts to
resolve the 13-year-old Angolan war.
   ``If these proposals are accepted, it is the South African
government's firm belief that there will be no losers,'' Botha said.
   ``The sovereignty of Angola will be without question, South-West
Africa will have gained independence and ... peace will have been
restored,'' he said.
   Botha said that if the cease-fire offer is accepted, South
Africa would withdraw its estimated 3,000 troops from southern
Angola by Sept. 1.
   On Nov. 1, South Africa would begin withdrawing from South-West
Africa under the guidelines of U.N. Resolution 435, which calls for
independence in the territory.
   Botha said the South African proposal envisions elections in
South-West Africa on June 1, 1989, provided Cuba has withdrawn its
estimated 50,000 troops from Angola by the same date.
   Cuba and Angola did not immediately comment on the proposal and
Botha said he could not say how they had responded at the Geneva
talks.
   Cuban troops are in Angola supporting the country's Marxist
government. South Africa and the United States support the rebels
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
   The South African proposal calls for the cease-fire to be
monitored by committees established at the current round of talks
in Geneva. Botha's statement did not specify who would do the
monitoring, although in the past he has proposed a U.N. presence.
   Botha said that if a cease-fire were to begin Aug. 10, it would
give U.N. officials almost three months to prepare for South
Africa's withdrawal from South-West Africa under the terms of
Resolution 435.
   South Africa, backed by the United States, has insisted that
independence for South-West Africa must be linked with a Cuban
troop withdrawal from Angola.
   Cuba and Angola have suggested a four-year timetable for the
Cuban withdrawal, while the South Africans and the United States
are seeking a much shorter time period.
   South Africa's mandate over South-West Africa was terminated by
the United Nations in 1966. But in defiance of several U.N.
resolutions, it has retained control of the country, which
possesses considerable mineral wealth.
   Among other issues addressed by the South African proposal are:
   _ The South-West Africa People's Organization, whose guerrillas
have been fighting for independence for 22 years. South Africa says
they must stop launching raids into South-West Africa from their
bases in southern Angola.
   _ African National Congress bases in Angola. South Africa says
the ANC, the main black group fighting to overthrow South Africa's
white government, has seven major military bases in Angola, and the
Pretoria government wants those bases closed down.
   _ Financial assistance for Namibia. South Africa spends billions
of dollars annually on South-West Africa. It is looking for someone
else to help the territory pay its bills, and has suggested the
five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
   The South African plan does not mention UNITA. The group's
leader, Jonas Savimbi, wants a power-sharing accord with the
Angolan government, but the country's Marxist leaders have so far
refused to negotiate with the guerrilla movement.
   None of the negotiating teams in Geneva made any comments
following Tuesday's session. The talks were scheduled to continue
Wednesday and Thursday.
   The Geneva talks are the fifth round of negotiations started in
May. Participants agreed last month on a basic set of 14 principles
that would lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Angola
and the granting of independence to Namibia. No timetable was
agreed on.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Pete Domenici says he doesn't think it's
likely he'll be chosen as George Bush's running mate, but he's
making some plans just in case.
   ``I still believe it's a long shot, but I can't go down (to the
convention in New Orleans) without a support group and without some
plans,'' he said.
   Domenici, R-N.M., said he would talk to New Mexico's convention
delegation and has already contacted some of his former staff
members for support at the convention.
   He mentioned one possible problem that could be brought up if he
were to be chosen _ ``the fussing with President Reagan'' over the
federal budget in 1986. The White House and the Senate Budget
Committee, which Domenici chaired at the time, were at odds over
how to cut the federal deficit.
   If he is chosen by Bush and if they are elected in November,
Domenici said, he has some science-related ideas for his own role
in the White House.
   ``I'd clearly want to define a few roles,'' he said. ``I'd like
to be the science and technology coordinator for the federal
government and bring the private sector into play.
   ``I'd like to see better use of the national laboratories and a
better organization of our effort in science,'' he said Monday.
``It's fragmented now. There's no continuity.''
   Domenici said he first learned last month he was on Bush's list
of possible running mates while flying from Albuquerque to
Washington on Air Force II with the vice president.

<HEAD>Commonwealth Meeting Opens With Call For Stronger Sanctions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADD 3 grafs UPDATING with South African statement objecting
to Commonwealth actions.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Stronger sanctions are needed to counter
increased repression and censorship in South Africa, a meeting of
Commonwealth foreign ministers was told Tuesday.
   Studies show that sanctions are working but ``could bite
harder,'' said Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal.
   He told the ministers from eight Commonwealth nations reviewing
the fight against apartheid that South Africa has reason to feel
secure.
   ``The sharply increased censorship and repression of the past
six months has drawn only verbal responses. The apartheid regime
long ago learned to ignore these ritual condemnations, and it is
growing increasingly confident that its major trading partners in
the West are not prepared to widen, tighten and intensify
sanctions,'' Ramphal said.
   Britain, which opposes sanctions, was conspicuous by its absence
from the committee of foreign ministers. Canada's Joe Clark is
chairman and the other envoys are from Australia, Guyana, India,
Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   The committee's task is to counter South African censorship and
propaganda; study security problems facing the black front-line
states; review the economic impact of sanctions; and examine South
Africa's continuing financial links around the world.
   Canada has organized a ``Rekindle the Light'' festival of
concerts and public forums to coincide with the two-day meeting,
climaxed by the lighting of candles on the shores of Lake Ontario
and in homes Tuesday night.
   The South African government fought back Tuesday with a
full-page advertisement in The Globe and Mail, the nation's leading
newspaper, which accused the Commonwealth envoys of slander and
hypocrisy.
   Signed by South African Ambassador Hendrik de Klerk, the ad said
five of the eight Commonwealth countries represented in Toronto
have press restrictions equal to, or more stringent than, South
Africa.
   ``We resent, as do South Africans of all colors, being singled
out for special condemnation.''
   It said more than 100 discriminatory laws have been abolished in
South Africa in the past decade, and claimed great improvements in
black income, education and housing. ``Sanctions, rejected by the
majority of blacks, frustrate this progress.''
   But Clark blasted South Africa for its crackdown on free speech,
including the refusal to grant a travel visa to Cyril Rhamaposa,
head of the South African miners' union, so he could attend the
Toronto meeting.
   ``In presenting a false image to the world, the government of
South Africa is also pretending to itself,'' Clark said. ``We will
consider individual new steps ... until the system of apartheid is
ended.''
   Canada made censorship the theme of the meeting and will propose
measures such as establishing a short-wave radio service from
neighboring countries.
   But Ramphal's speech underlined concern by many delegates to
keep the focus on economic sanctions.
   ``In the absence of sanctions, apartheid will persist and the
cycle of violence will only intensify. Effective sanctions have
been withheld; apartheid has persisted; the cycle of violence has
intensified.''
   Ramphal welcomed new sanctions that have been proposed in the
U.S. Congress and threatened by the European Community. ``South
Africa is immune to anti-apartheid gestures. It is only action that
will bring the whole sordid system down,'' he said.
   In South Africa, the Department of Foreign Affairs called the
Commonwealth's actions in Canada a ``blatant interference in the
domestic affairs of South Africa.''
   J.W. Meiring, deputy minister of foreign affairs, called in
Canadian Ambassador R.S. Maclean to express South Africa's
objections to the scheduled events.
   The department statement said, ``The South African government
objected to the biased selectivity of the Canadian government. .. .
By these actions the Canadian government does not contribute in any
way constructively toward achieving a peaceful solution to the
problems of southern Africa.''

   A list of the most sought-after books in the
Soviet Union this summer shows readers are clamoring for works like
Anatoly Rybakov's ``Children of the Arbat'' and other novels born
in the age of glasnost or released after years on the censor's
shelves.
   The government newspaper Izvestia ranked the most popular works
of literature in an article that urged larger printings of books,
both in hard-bound novel form for library sales and in the
circulation of monthly magazines that serialize major books.
   Izvestia said Monday it determined the 12 most popular books in
the Soviet Union based on waiting lists at library reading halls,
where Soviets can sign up for a turn to read the works on the
premises.
   Some books can be checked out of libraries, but works with an
especially strong following are kept at the libraries to prevent
theft. Fines for books that aren't returned are a fraction of what
it might cost on the black market.
   Most of the books occupying the top spots on the Soviet list
compiled by Izvestia are stories written years ago but banned by
authorities or held back by the authors for fear of censorship.
   ``Children of the Arbat,'' written two decades ago and, is the
most popular book among Soviet readers, according to the newspaper.
It takes the reader into the life of a student persecuted and
exiled during the 1930s under Josef Stalin. It was published last
month in the United States by Little, Brown and Co.
   Stalin's repressions feature in several of the best sellers,
including No. 2 ``White Clothing,'' about Soviet scientists'
manipulation of genetic research in the late 1940s, and No. 6 ``The
Golden Cloud Slumbered,'' recounting the horrors perpetrated on
Soviet ethnic groups exiled for alleged collaboration with the
Nazis during World War II.
   Other works popular with readers now were held back by Soviet
censors for decades, like Boris Pasternak's ``Doctor Zhivago,'' a
sympathetic account of the hardships endured by an aristocratic
doctor following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Izvestia said
Pasternak's work, for which he won the 1958 Nobel Prize, is the
fourth most popular book among Soviets. It was released two years
ago in a limited printing mostly sold to foreigners for hard
currency and early this year was serialized in the monthly magazine
Novy Mir.
   Serial printings in mass-circulation magazines like Novy Mir
offer the best access to new releases for most Soviets. Even the
most popular books are issued in relatively small quantities in
comparison with demand.
   But the periodicals are usually available only by subscription,
and they are relatively costly for Soviet pensioners and others
with low incomes.
   Izvestia complained that Soviet publishers waste their limited
resources producing political tomes and brochures that few want to
read. As a result, waiting lists for popular books at public
libraries have more than tripled in the past year, the newspaper
said.
   Izvestia pressed state publishers to redirect resources so the
avid reading public would not have to waste so much time waiting in
line for books.
   ``Economists have calculated that for various goods and services
we stand in lines for 65 billion man-hours a year,'' the newspaper
said of the Soviet Union's 284 million citizens. ``But the time we
have to spend in pursuit of culture is no less expensive.''
   Part of the increase in interest at public libraries has been
the release of thousands of previously banned works.
   The newspaper Soviet Culture reported in March that GlavLit, the
state body which since 1922 has been responsible for censorship, is
conducting a review of 6,000 books held in ``special detention''
storehouses.
   Of the 4,000 titles reviewed by spring, 3,500 had been returned
to library shelves, the newpaper reported.
   Izvestia said No. 3 in popularity among Soviets is ``Favorite''
by Valentin Pikul, about one of Catherine the Great's lovers,
Grigory Potemkin.
   Following No. 4 ``Doctor Zhivago'' was Alexander Bek's ``The New
Appointment,'' which portrays a bureaucrat's fall from power.
   Izvestia ranked the remaining books as follows: No. 6, ``The
Golden Cloud Slumbered'' by Anatoly Pristavkin; No. 7, ``The
Chopping Block'' by Chingiz Aitmatov; No. 8, ``The Godfather'' by
American writer Mario Puzo; No. 9, ``Onward, Onward, Onward,'' a
play by Mikhail Shatrov; No. 10, ``Life and Fate'' by Vasily
Grossman; No. 11, ``History of the Government of Russia'' by
Nikolai Karamzin; and No. 12, ``The Master and Margarita'' by
Mikhail Bulgakov.

   A maple syrup producer has agreed to pay
$25,000 in fines as part of a settlement following allegations that
the firm mislabeled maple products.
   Maple Grove Farms of Vermont Inc. in St. Johnsbury neither
admitted nor denied any wrongdoing. But it agreed to pay the fines
to the state and to reimburse the $10,000 it cost the Vermont
Department of Agriculture to investigate the matter.
   The company also agreed to make a $15,000 donation to maple
research at the University of Vermont.
   The complaint included allegations that the company labeled
maple syrup at a higher grade than it should have been and sold
products carrying labels such as ``pure Vermont maple candy'' that
included cane sugar.
   Maple Grove President William Callahan III said in a prepared
statement that the company was being ``taken out to the woodshed
for some problems beyond our control and others for which we can
make little argument.''
   He said the company agreed to the fine to avoid a costly legal
battle.
   The settlement followed an investigation by the attorney
general's office.
   ``We've just come through the two absolute worst years in the
maple business, not only in terms of quantity but also in terms of
quality,'' Callahan said in a telephone interview. ``It was
difficult to have syrup at the higher end of grade range. It would
not withstand the test of time.''
   As part of the settlement, Maple Grove is to notify customers
that some sryup sold in 1987 and during the first three months of
1988 may have darkened, fallen below grade or been misgraded. Some
changes in labeling also were agreed upon on containers that
contain syrup not produced in Vermont.
   Maple Grove also agreed to recall maple candy sold between April
1987 and April 1988. The candy is to be re-labeled as a
maple-flavored product or destroyed.
   Steven Wallach of the Vermont Department of Agriculture said
that while inspectors are continously sampling maple products, no
other companies were involved in this investigation.

   Flying enthusiasts from Brazil to Australia
have gathered here for what some call an aviation paradise, where
supersonic jets fly over the countryside, pilots discuss the latest
innovations and flying families camp under the wings of planes.
   They are here for the 36th annual Experimental Aircraft
Association fly-in and convention. An estimated 1 million people
and 14,000 planes are expected to visit Wittman Field before the
week-long convention ends Friday.
   ``People who are into airplanes are airplane nuts and this is
like Mecca to us and we'll do anything to get to Oshkosh,'' said
Frank Stankiewicz, 53, of Fort Meyers, Fla.
   Thousands of them crowd the flight line during the daily
airshows to watch a fly-by of the supersonic Concorde or see a
Wildcat Flyer, a biplane crop duster, lace the sky with looping
ribbons of pink, yellow and white smoke.
   They fill workshop tents where they learn tips for making wings
and tails out of metal or wood and exhibit halls where they can see
the weather mapping systems.
   They also attend seminars where they can learn such things as,
``How to prepare your aircraft and safety precautions when
painting,'' or ``The basics of friction wear and lubrication.''
   Some camp under the wings of the planes parked wingtip to
wingtip that fill much of the 1,200 acres in the convention area.
Others park in nearby grounds or drive 50 miles away to Green Bay
for a hotel room.
   ``As an aviator and pilot, I wouldn't miss it for the world,''
T. Allan McArtor, Federal Aviation Administration administrator,
said Tuesday.
   McArtor, whose agency adds about 40 extra air traffic
controllers to help direct planes during the convention, called it
``the biggest gathering of the clan'' in general aviation.
   For nine days before and during the convention, Wittman Field
becomes the world's busiest airport with between 57,000 and 60,000
takeoffs and landings, said Zonnie Fritsche, FAA Oshkosh control
tower manager. The average of more than 6,000 operations a day is
more than double the 2,500 Chicago's O'Hare International Airport
usually has, he said.
   By Monday, 1,405 people from 61 countries, including 128 from
Brazil, 64 from England, 165 from Australia and 51 from Japan, had
registered.
   ``They love planes,'' said Flavio Del Mese of Porto Alegre,
Brazil. ``We have small shows, but after you watch Oshkosh, it's
better if you say we have no shows.''
   The aircraft displayed, and in many cases flown, include the B1B
bomber, a Marine Corps Harrier vertical takeoff and landing jet,
the Goodyear blimp, vintage World War II fighters and bombers, and
homebuilt airplanes constructed by association members.
   Convention Chairman Tom Poberezny, whose father, Paul, founded
the EAA in 1953, said the planes may draw the crowds but the real
reason people come is for the company of other aviation buffs.
   The EAA attracts such people as Neil Armstrong, the first man to
walk on the moon, and the crew that flew around the world in the
lightweight Voyager aircraft.
   ``Where else could you talk to the captain of the Concorde or
pilots who flew around the world?'' asked Dr. David Bryant, an EAA
member, pilot and doctor at the medical tent.
   ``Whether you're a doctor or farmer ... you're on the same level
here,'' said Oliver Washburn, 56, a corporate pilot from Pittsburgh.
   For W. K. Kellum, 69, of Jackson, Miss., who has built one plane
and is working on two others, part of the attraction is a flea
market with nuts, bolts, screws and other plane parts.
   ``It would be hard to find around at that price,'' he said. ``It
looks junky to people if they don't know what they want but it
might be just what I need.''
   One volunteer EAA flagman died this year after being struck by a
plane and knocked to the ground, but EAA spokesman John Burton said
there have been fewer than a dozen fatal accidents at the
convention over the years.

<HEAD>Pilot's Unorthodox Landing Approach Blamed For Detroit Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot's decision to make an unorthodox
landing approach using an abrupt reduction in speed led to the
March 1987 commuter plane crash at Detroit in which nine people
were killed, federal investigators concluded Tuesday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board faulted David Sherer,
45, of Crestline, Ohio, the pilot of the Northwest AirLink commuter
plane, for the crash. Investigators said he was unable to control
his aircraft after he deliberately put its propellers in
``reverse'' pitch to hasten his descent.
   The technique, which the pilot has used at least three times
previously, was contrary to the airline's procedures and ``against
common sense and proper pilot techniques,'' board vice chairman
James Kolstad told reporters.
   The NTSB said the nine crash victims probably would have
survived had the plane not been engulfed in flames. Kolstad said
all nine died of smoke inhalation and burns rather than injuries
suffered from the impact of the crash.
   The board urged the Federal Aviation Administration to expand
its requirements for materials blocking fire and toxic smoke in
smaller commuter aircraft such as the 22-seat CASA 212 plane that
crashed at Detroit. The FAA requires such protection in large jet
aircraft.
   The twin-engine AirLink turboprop, Flight 2268, was carrying 19
people when it came in for a landing at Detroit's Metropolitan
Airport on March 4, 1987, and went out of control.
   The plane cartwheeled onto a taxiway and slid upside down into a
service vehicle before it burst into flames. It narrowly missed a
jetliner taking on passengers at a gate.
   The plane was operated by Fischer Bros. Aviation but flew under
the name Northwest AirLink because of a marketing agreement with
Northwest Airlines.
   The NTSB said the probable cause of the accident was ``the
captain's inability to control the airplane in an attempt to
recover from an asymmetrical power condition ... following his
intentional use of (a reverse power) propeller position'' during
descent.
   The investigation showed that the pilot had used a similar
approach technique on at least three previous occasions in an
attempt to bring his plane down rapidly and land ``on the numbers''
near a taxiway turnoff to AirLink's gate.
   Sherer as well as the co-pilot and seven passengers were killed
in the crash.
   One investigator compared the technique used by Sherer in
attempting to land Flight 2268 as a ``slam dunk'' onto the runway.
   During the approach, according to the NTSB, the pilot switched
the twin-engine aircraft into so-called ``beta'' mode where the
propellers are positioned to provide reverse power instead of
normal positive power. This position is similar to reverse engine
thrust in a jet aircraft and is used to slow the plane once on the
ground.
   When such a technique is used while a plane is airborne, it has
the effect of causing a rapid descent. But in the case of Flight
2268, the pilot lost control of the aircraft, the board said.
   Sherer's problems may have been aggravated by a
higher-than-normal fuel flow setting for both the plane's engines,
which caused a speed increase as the plane approached the runway.
   The NTSB also suggested that Sherer might have been concerned
about the presence of a Northwest Airlines DC-9 which was on the
runway preparing to depart.

   Westfield State College trustees chose a

President Irving H. Buchen.
   Buchen quit last week after his use of college trust funds for
personal expenses came under scrutiny and criticism.
   He also had been under fire for waiving entrance requirements
for his 16-year-old daughter. She attended the college and lived in
a dormitory during the fall semester last year although she had not
graduated from high school.
   ``We are very fortunate to have someone of her intellect,
ability and common sense to oversee the supervision of the college
during this period,'' said John St. Clair, chairman of the
trustees, in announcing the appointment of Tilia J. Fantasia.
   Buchen was hired by Westfield State 15 months ago, succeeding
Francis J. Pilecki, who left amid charges of sexual misconduct with
male students, and a furor over a $10,000 payment by trustees to
one of the students. He was cleared of criminal charges.

<HEAD>Beer Industry Official Supports Drunken Driving Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of an association of beer
distributors voiced support Tuesday for a bill that would encourage
states to crack down on drunken drivers.
   ``Beer wholesalers don't need the business of drunk drivers,''
Ronald R. Rumbaugh, president of the National Beer Wholesalers'
Association, told the Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee. ``We
don't want their business. In fact, we want to put them out of
business.''
   The subcommittee heard from Rumbaugh and other private and
government officials about proposed legislation offering increased
federal aid to states that adopt several strict plans intended to
prevent traffic accidents caused by drunken drivers.
   Among them are the immediate confiscation of a driver's license
when the operator fails a chemical test for intoxication or refuses
to take such a test. The state would have 15 days to suspend the
license or return it to the operator.
   Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia already have
programs in which drivers' licenses can be suspended through
administrative action, rather than by the courts, according to the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
   ``By encouraging states to adopt tough laws that have proven to
be effective, the bill will save lives,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., the measure's chief sponsor.
   An official of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said his agency opposed the legislation.
   George Reagle, associate administrator for traffic safety, said
the bill had such tight procedures _ such as allowing only 15 days
to decide on license suspensions _ that most states would not be
able to benefit from it.

   Israeli troops killed one Palestinian and
wounded 13 others in clashes Tuesday, hospital officials said.
Arabs staged a commercial strike protesting Israel's deportation of
29 Palestinians in the last seven months.
   In Nablus, the largest city in the occupied West Bank, troops
opened fire when their patrol was hit by a barrage of stones,
killing said 18-year-old Edin Al Aghbar with a bullet to the
abdomen, an official at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   An army official confirmed the death but said the Palestinian
was shot as he was about to hurl a brick from a rooftop at a
soldier standing below.
   The death brought to 236 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Arab rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip began last Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died.
   Disturbances in Nablus and the nearby Balata refugee camp broke
out after the killing, and nine Palestinians were wounded by army
gunfire, officials at two Nablus hospitals said. Seven Arabs were
injured by rubber bullets and beatings, doctors said.
   The army official said he only had reports of two Palestinians
being injured in Nablus either by live gunfire or rubber bullets.
   In the West Bank village of Dura, about 25 miles south of
Jerusalem, troops shot and wounded two Arabs, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip's Shati refugee camp, troops fired tear gas
after demonstrators violated a curfew and stoned an army patrol, an
Arab reporter said.
   Officials at Shifa hospital said two Palestinians suffered
bullet wounds and another was beaten by soldiers at Shati. An army
spokesman confirmed that Israeli soldiers shot and wounded two
Palestinians.
   Also on Tuesday, an Israeli newspaper reported that Jordan's
King Hussein told Foreign Minister Shimon Peres through an
intermediary that he was still committed to the Middle East peace
process.
   The message was conveyed to Peres by an American Jewish leader,
the daily Yediot Ahronot said. It said the Jewish leader met with
Hussein before the Jordanian monarch's announcement Sunday that he
was cutting legal and administrative ties with the West Bank.
   Hussein's decision was a serious setback for Peres' left-wing
Labor Party, which had cultivated Jordan as a negotiating partner.
   On April 11, 1987, Peres and Hussein met secretly in London and
agreed to direct talks between Israel and a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation under the aegis of an
international conference.
   Yediot Ahronot said Hussein indicated in his message to Peres
that he still abided by the London agreement.
   Throughout the occupied territories, Palestinians shuttered
shops and halted transport for a second straight day to protest
Israel's deportation policy.
   The strike was fueled by the expulsion Monday of eight more
Palestinians accused of inciting the rebellion. The expulsion
brought the number of deportations since the uprising began to 29.
   The chief army prosecutor, Lt. Col. Amnon Strasnov, described
the deportees as ``encouragers and inciters in the territories who
have played a substantial role in'' the uprising.
   He said the deportations were an effective deterrent, adding
that the policy had to be carried out selectively.
   In another development, the English-language daily Jerusalem
Post said a group of prominent Israelis had formed an organization
to publicize the dangers a high Arab birth rate poses to the Jewish
state.
   The committee published figures showing there are 630,000
Palestinian and 590,000 Israeli children under 8 years of age in
Israel and the occupied territories. By 2000, Arabs under the age
of 18 will outnumber Jews 1.4 million to 1.3 million, the committee
said.

<HEAD>Irving Berlin's Wife Eulogized: `The Song Is Not Ending'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Irving Berlin wasn't there, but his words echoed
through St. Patrick's Cathedral on Tuesday as his wife of 62 years,
Ellin Mackay Berlin, was eulogized for her role in one of America's
greatest love stories.
   ``The song is not ending; it will continue into eternity,'' the
Rev. Anthony Dalla Villa told the Berlins' three daughters and
several hundred other mourners at the funeral Mass for Mrs. Berlin,
85, who died Friday. ``To use your father's words, `Always,
always.'''
   Berlin, who is now 100 and has shunned public occasions for
decades, wrote the songs ``Always'' and ``The Song is Ended'' for
his wife, the daughter of a socially prominent family who married
the composer over her father's vehement objections.
   Their marriage, on Jan. 4, 1926, was one of the most publicized
social events of its era. Mrs. Berlin's father, Clarence,
threatened to disinherit his daughter for marrying Berlin, a
Russian immigrant and a widower.
   Mrs. Berlin was a successful author whose works included four
novels.
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, in brief remarks at the end of the
Mass, praised Mrs. Berlin for having had ``the courage and common
sense ... to recognize the fraudulence'' of social conventions and
follow her heart.
   ``No man could have given the joy to the world (that has been)
given by Irving Berlin without the love of a woman like Mrs.
Berlin,'' O'Connor said.
   Among the mourners at the funeral were Kitty Carlisle Hart,
former Mayor John Lindsay, David and Helen Gurley Brown and Jean
MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

   The world's Anglican bishops urged
governments Tuesday to press for the release of hostages held in
Lebanon, and an American bishop said he was optimistic after months
of talks with Iranian officials.
   A resolution passed unanimously by the 525 bishops said
governments ``with influence'' should pressure kidnappers in
Lebanon to free foreign hostages, who include Anglican church envoy
Terry Waite and nine Americans.
   Mostakbal, an Arabic-language weekly published in Paris, quoted
the spiritual leader of Lebanon's most radical pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem group Tuesday as saying American hostages may be freed
before the U.S. presidential election in November.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah's organization is Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella for groups
holding most of the 18 foreign hostages.
   Episcopal Bishop Robert C. Witcher of Long Island, N.Y., said he
began talks in April with Iranian officials accompanying victims of
chemical weapon attacks in the Iran-Iraq war who were taken to New
York for treatment.
   ``I would say from my conversations with the Iranians that they
really want to solve this problem,'' Witcher said in an interview
after addressing the Lambeth conference of Anglican bishops in
Canterbury.
   The resolution, which welcomed U.N. efforts for a cease-fire in
the 8-year-old war, also condemned the use of chemical weapons and
said ``further use by any country should immediately be met by
punitive sanctions.''
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has made new
efforts to free Waite and the other foreigners.
   Australian Archbishop David Penman returned last week from Iran
and the Rt. Rev. John Brown, bishop in Cyprus and the Persian Gulf,
was in Lebanon seeking information about four Iranians who
disappeared in a Christian area of the city in July 1982.
   Penman said Monday he believes the Western hostages will be
released after national elections in November in Israel and the
United States.
   Runcie has tried to learn the fate of the Iranians as part of an
attempt to get Iran to use its influence with kidnappers holding
foreign hostages. Unconfirmed reports say the Iranians, all
Moslems, were killed.
   ``The grief of the families of hostages is universal, knowing no
boundaries of religion or nationality,'' he said at the conference.
   About Waite, who disappeared in January 1987 after leaving his
hotel to negotiate for the release of Americans, Archbishop Runcie
said: ``He was kidnapped more than 18 months ago, 561 days ago, and
it is day by day that the families of hostages count their misery.''
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Witcher, 61, said he met Iranian officials for the first time at
St. John's Episcopal Hospital in the New York City borough of
Queens _ part of his diocese _ where several Iranian Kurds gassed
in the war were treated.
   He said in an interview he continued talks with the Iranians
``at the hospital, at their office in the embassy and at their
homes.'' Witcher said he had not discussed the talks with the State
Department.
   ``They (the Iranians) said they would deliver the message to
Tehran and left it at that,'' the bishop said.

<HEAD>Panel Reports On Police Handling of Bond Allegations</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with more details from report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen months after it was appointed, a panel
that looked into the handling of drug abuse allegations against
former state Sen. Julian Bond by his wife has concluded its work
with only one recommendation _ that standard operating procedures
in the Atlanta Police Bureau be redefined.
   The committee of civic leaders was appointed by Mayor Andrew
Young in April 1987 to look into how police and other city
officials handled Alice Bond's allegations that her estranged
husband and other prominent Atlantans abused cocaine. Bond denied
using drugs.
   In its report to the mayor Monday, the panel did not address the
conduct of any city officials.
   Co-chairmen Jesse Hill Jr. and Thomas R. Williams wrote that the
redefinition of police procedures the panel called for ``will
probably occur during the (police department's national)
accreditation review, which the panel understands is presently
under way.
   ``However, if this does not occur, a management study of the
department and its standard operating procedures should be
conducted.''
   Young ``really didn't have anything to say about the report,''
said his spokesman, Nehl Horton. ``He thanked them for their hard
work.''
   Public Safety Commissioner George Napper could not be reached
for comment. He was testifying Tuesday in Washington before a
Senate committee about gun control.
   Mrs. Bond made her allegations to Atlanta police narcotics
investigators in March 1987.
   She later withdrew the allegations after a call from Young.
There were accusations at the time that the mayor pressured Mrs.
Bond and that the white officers who talked to her manipulated the
statement to implicate black officials.
   The panel made five observations about the Police Bureau in its
report.
   It said standard operating procedures frequently were not
followed, that levels of competence in the Police Bureau are
varied, that residual racial problems exist in the bureau, that
internal security and confidentiality are lax, and that discipline
is inconsistently administered.
   The bulk of the six-page report complained about roadblocks to
the panel's work resulting from media and court activities, saying,
``we regret the combination of circumstances that rendered
concerned, well-meaning citizens not as effective in this challenge
for our community as we would have preferred.''
   ``The initial delay came with the investigation by the federal
grand jury. This investigation resulted in no indictments. The next
delay came with the request from The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution that all of the panel's meeting be opened to
all media and the public.''
   The panel's refusal of that request resulted in a lawsuit that
eventually resulted in a ruling from the Georgia Supreme Court that
the panel was not subject to the state's open meetings laws.
   The panel did not meet during those court proceedings.
   The investigation also was hindered by a restraining order
obtained by radio and televison stations that prohibited the
Atlanta Police Department's Office of Professional Standards from
handing over the so-called ``Bond Report,'' a review of the charges.
   ``Without this report, the panel, without any funding to employe
investigators or other staff, was stymied in its efforts to conduct
a timely and adequate review,'' the report said.
   ``Its subpoena power had been declared illegal by the Supreme
Court of Georgia. It was clear that the newspapers and television
stations had as much or more documentation of relevant information,
in that they had obtained copies of the Alice Bond interview tape,
the confidential memo from the interview officers ... directed to
Chief (Morris) Redding summarizing the Alice Bond interview, as
well as a copy of the complete detailed Office of Professional
Standards' report.
   In addition, the panel said, ``the mayor's pardon of all police
officers mooted most of what remained for the panel's
investigation'' and it decided its work was concluded.

   The United States is examining creation of an
international peacekeeping force as a way to prevent the Khmer
Rouge from resuming power in Cambodia, the State Department said
Tuesday.
   The proposal is one of several that were explored in talks last
week between the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh and
three guerrilla factions seeking to overthrow the rulers, said
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   Other State Department officials said discussions on the
possibility of a peacekeeping force were in a very preliminary
stage and thus it was too early to tell which nations, including
the United States, might supply troops for it.
   A peacekeeping force would be designed to take over from the
Vietnamese troops who are scheduled to withdraw from the country by
1990. Vietnam and other countries are fearful that the vacuum left
by the pullout would allow the murderous Khmer Rouge group to take
over Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge, who were accused of killing hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians during their three-year rule, were replaced
by Vietnam when it invaded Cambodia in 1978.
   Some Khmer Rouge found refuge in China and neighboring Thailand,
while others stayed in Cambodia and joined the anti-government
rebels.
   China has reportedly promised to cease its support for the Khmer
Rouge if Vietnam pulls out.
   In a television interview Tuesday, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
urged the United States and other western governments to prevent
the re-emergence of the Khmer Rouge, which he said ``could very
easily lead to another holocaust in Cambodia.''
   ``I think the West needs to do much more than what it has been
doing in order to prevent such a dreadful eventuality from coming
about,'' Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Asian and Pacific affairs, said on the ``CBS This Morning''
program.
   ``We would support any reasonable measures to prevent the return
of the Khmer Rouge and to safeguard the right of the Cambodian
people to choose their own destiny,'' said Mrs. Oakley.
   ``But the shape of a final settlement depends on direct
negotiations between the key parties, and must be in the context of
agreement on complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' she added.
   The first-ever talks between the sides last week in Indonesia
failed to achieve a breakthough although working groups were set up
to negotiate and make recommendations by year's end.
   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Tuesday, another State Department official said an international
peacekeeping force is one of several options being considered to
prevent the Khmer Rouge from again taking power in Cambodia.
   ``Crafting a solution will not be easy,'' said David Lambertson,
deputy assistant secretary of State for South East Asia. ``The
Khmer Rouge remain probably the most militarily powerful of the
Cambodian factions.''
   Lambertson said options advanced by Cambodia's neighbors and by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the nation's former ruler, include holding
internationally supervised elections.
   ``We cannot imagine the Cambodian people would willingly vote
for the return of the Khmer Rouge,'' Lambertson said.
   He said other options include removing Pol Pot and other Khmer
Rouge leaders ``most responsible for crimes against the Cambodian
people'' and disarming all Cambodian political factions.
   Also under consideration, he said, are a cutoff of the flow of
arms from outside Cambodia's borders. ``We believe some combination
of these or other approaches could prove effective,'' Lambertson
said.
   Lambertson said the United States also believes it is important
to maintain diplomatic pressure against Vietnam until it has
completely withdrawn its troops from Cambodia.
   He reiterated that the Reagan administration opposes legislation
under discussion in Congress to establish diplomatic interest
sections in Hanoi and Washington to expand contacts between the two
nations.
   Lambertson said such a step now would be seen as ``a major
political victory'' by Hanoi and a sign by the non-communist
resistance inside Cambodia as ``a deeply discouraging signal of a
weakened American commitment.''
   Under pressure from the Soviet Union, Vietnam has promised to
pull out its estimated 120,000 troops by 1990, but has demanded
assurances that the Khmer Rouge will not return.
   The Soviet Union and China have scheduled an unusual meeting in
Peking later this month to discuss a Cambodian settlement.
   China has told the United States that Soviet cooperation on the
Cambodia issue could remove one of the remaining obstacles to a
top-level summit meeting between the two communist giants, who have
been at odds for more than 30 years.

<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate Tuesday refused a
request by two newspapers to release documents relating to a search
by federal agents of three Unisys Corp. offices as part of the
Pentagon procurement probe.
   U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd agreed with the government's
position that release of search warrants, affidavits and other
documents would jeopardize the federal investigation into possible
illegalities in Defense Department contracting.
   ``The court finds that preserving the sensitivity of the ongoing
criminal investigation is a sufficiently compelling interest to
justify denial of public access,'' Cudd wrote in his decision.
   The Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch had sought
access to the documents.
   ``We're going to appeal,'' said Tim McGuire, Star Tribune
managing editor. ``It's a matter of important public interest. The
progress of this investigation demands press scrutiny.''
   Cudd said the sealed material contains sensitive information
identifying people who are the focus of the investigation, their
activities, and programs being investigated, as well as documents
the government hopes to obtain.
   ``Were this information made public, there is a substantial
probability the investigation would be irreparably damaged,'' Cudd
wrote.
   He said he was concerned about the possibility that documents
might be destroyed and witnesses might attempt to tailor their
accounts of events if they knew the scope and direction of the
investigation.
   ``The court is also concerned that disclosure would interfere
with the legitimate privacy of persons whose conversations were
intercepted during authorized wiretaps and who are therefore
mentioned in the affidavits, but who, upon further investigation,
may not be criminally culpable,'' Cudd wrote.
   Although Cudd acknowledged that release of the documents would
be in the public interest, he found that ``disclosure at this
preliminary stage would unnecessarily subject innocent third
parties to the risk of serious injury.''
   Patrick Schiltz, attorney for the Star Tribune, argued at a July
22 hearing that keeping the search warrants and affidavits sealed
is pointless because ``any reasonably informed observer'' could
make a good guess as to what is involved in the investigation
simply by reading newspapers.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Anderson told the magistrate
that because the information was printed in newspapers ``doesn't
make it accurate.''
   FBI agents on June 13 searched three offices at the Unisys plant
in Eagan, Unisys plants elsewhere in the country and offices of
other major defense contractors in 11 other states and the District
of Columbia.
   The Eagan facilities of Unisys Defense Systems make mainframe
computers for the U.S. Defense Department. No weapons are made at
the facilities and most of the computers are used by the Navy.
   Other news organizations are seeking release of similar
documents around the country.
   Last week, the new head of the Minneapolis FBI office said he
expects indictments and guilty pleas in the Twin Cities area as
part of the national defense procurement investigation.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday imposed fines that could
bankrupt the city of Yonkers because of its defiance of a housing
desegregation order and suggested that Gov. Mario Cuomo remove
recalcitrant council members from office.
   ``There does have to come a moment of truth, a moment of
responsibility, a moment when the city of Yonkers seeks not to
become the national symbol of defiance to civil rights, heaping
shame upon shame upon itself,'' said District Judge Leonard Sand.
   Ruling that Yonkers was in contempt for not approving his plan
to desegregate housing, Sand fined the city $100 for the first day
and said the amount would double each succeeding day. After 22
days, the fines would swallow the city's entire $337 million budget.
   Sand also found three of four councilmen who voted against his
plan in contempt and fined them $500 a day. The fourth had his case
adjourned so he could get a lawyer. The judge also said the council
members could go to jail if they remain in contempt until Aug. 10.
   The council members have said they would appeal the contempt
finding and the penalties, but no quick hearing is likely and all
previous attempts to appeal Sand's rulings have failed.
   Sand's action came after two years of threats against Yonkers
for failing to build low- and middle-income housing after he ruled
i 1985 that the city had segregated housing and schools
intentionally over a 40-year period. It was the first time a judge
had tied school segregation to housing segregation.
   On Monday night, the City Council voted 4-3 against the
court-ordered package of bonuses, financial incentives and zoning
variances to attract developers to build 800 units of affordable
housing throughout the city.
   Michael Sculnick, the city's outside counsel, asked the judge
not to fine the city because it was the council, not the city,
which had taken the action. The fines would ruin the city's fiscal
standing, he said, noting that Moody's Investors Service has said a
contempt finding would jeopardize the city's bond rating.
   But Sand said the council had been aware of the implications of
its actions all along and called its action a ``competition to see
who can attract the greatest notoriety ... who will be the
political martyr without regard for what is in the best interest of
the city of Yonkers.''
   Saying the council was unable to govern in a ``fiscally
responsible manner,'' Sand urged the state to step in.
   The city was saved from bankruptcy in 1984 by a state bailout
and has its finances supervised by a state-run Emergency Financial
Control Board, which can remove council members for fiscal
irresponsibility.
   When Sculnick said that might be an unfair burden on the state,
Sand angrily replied, ``Unfair to have a responsibility when a city
of almost 200,000 totters on the brink of bankruptcy, makes itself
a symbol of defiance to a federal court and acts in a manner so
devastatingly adverse to the interest of its citizens? It's too
much to ask state officials to respond?''
   After the ruling, a spokesman for the governor said only that
Cuomo's office and the Financial Control Board were monitoring the
situation. On Monday, Cuomo said it would be ``inappropriate'' for
the state to intervene.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasiscko, who has supported the desegregation
plan, said he would contact Cuomo Tuesday but would not ask for the
removal of council members.
   If the council doesn't reverse its opposition to the plan and
the state doesn't intervene, Sand could form a housing commission
to build the new housing without council approval.
   Attorneys for Nicholas Longo, Peter Chema and Edward Fagan said
they opposed the plan because of procedural deficiencies in the
resolution. Sand set an evidentiary hearing for Monday, but still
found them in contempt.
   Vice Mayor Henry Spallone, the most vociferous opponent,
appeared without a lawyer and had his case adjourned until at least
Wednesday.
   Fagan said he would consider resigning from the council but
Longo and Spallone said they would not resign. Chema declined

   After the court session, officials were greeted outside the
courthouse by about 100 demonstrators chanting, ``Don't get mad,
get a new mayor,'' referring to Wasiscko's support for the plan,
and ``No justice, no peace.''

<HEAD>College Where Student Died After Lab Experiment Fined $3,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A community college has been fined $3,000
as a result of an investigation ordered after the death of a
student who was given the wrong liquid to drink in a laboratory
experiment.
   Pierce College was cited Monday for 10 violations of safety
procedures and fined for failing to implement a program to inform
employees about hazardous chemicals, said Barbara Dunn of the state
Department of Labor and Industries.
   The school failed to carry out a ``hazardous communication
program'' for handling chemicals 10 months after first being cited
for that shortcoming, Ms. Dunn said. The college had the program in
writing but had not implemented it, she said.
   School president Brent Knight said safety programs had been
improved and the fine would be appealed.
   The investigation followed the death of Dawn Collins, 29, of
Puyallup, on June 5, four days after she drank a solution during a
urinalysis experiment in an anatomy and physiology class.
   The experiment called for a simple saline solution, basically
salt water, but instead she was mistakenly given a solution
containing sodium azide, a preservative.
   Richard Montecucco, an assistant attorney general investigating
the case, said a lab technician apparently used a premixed saline
solution containing sodium azide, rather than mixing the solution
using salt tablets and water.
   Ms. Dunn said her agency, which investigates accidents involving
workers, was not legally required to reinspect the school after the
woman's death, since she was not a college employee. But she said
it decided to do so because it was ``very obvious'' the school had
not complied with the order issued in August.
   The latest citations were praised by Jack Connelly, an attorney
for the Collins family who said he was preparing a lawsuit against
the college.
   ``It's very apparent in Dawn Collins' case that the appropriate
measures were not followed, and somebody should have known what was
in that container,'' Connelly said.
   Investigators found improperly labeled chemicals at the school,
their 11-page report said.
   A half-gallon metal container with tape marked ``poison'' on the
side was found in the art building, and an unmarked brass can of
lithotine, a toxic mineral spirit with pine oil, was in the art
building storage room, Ms. Dunn said.
   One violation said college employees, including lab workers,
were not given information and training on hazardous chemicals in
their work areas.
   Knight, however, contended that officials of the 8,000-student
school in the suburbs south of the city had been working to meet
the requirements of a workers' ``right to know'' law adopted in
1986. The law requires employers to inform employees of hazardous
chemicals in the workplace and have available information on
procedures for chemical emergencies.
   The state agency fined the college $240 last September for seven
violations, including lack of programs for accident prevention or
handling hazardous materials. College officials appealed and the
fine was reduced to $60, which was paid in November, said agency
spokesman Rolland Lund.
   The first citations resulted from an investigation after an
employee was burned when an electric spray-painter came in contact
with flammable liquid.
   Last month, a Washington State Patrol bomb squad removed 13
liters _ more than four gallons _ of hazardous, outdated ether from
the school's science labs during a cleanout of lab chemicals.

<HEAD>US Proposes Tough Rules to Ensure Accuracy of Pap Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government proposed tougher
uniform standards Tuesday for clinical laboratories in an effort to
ensure the accuracy of Pap Smears and other tests.
   The proposed rules, published in the Federal Register, apply to
the 12,000 labs that are federally regulated either because they do
work under Medicare or Medicaid or engage in interstate commerce.
   The practial effect is to cover virtually all commercial labs,
except those in physicians' offices. However, Congress has ordered
the Health Care Financing Administration _ or HCFA _ to regulate
physicians' office labs that test 5,000 specimens or more starting
Jan. 1, 1990.
   The 90-day public comment period outlined in Tuesday's notice
also solicits comments on whether the uniform standards should
apply to physicians' office labs once they are covered by federal
standards.
   Under current law, labs must participate in an approved program
of proficiency testing to receive Medicare or Medicaid funds. The
standards can vary from state to state and between groups that
conduct the proficiency exams, such as the College of American
Pathologists and the American Association of Bioanalysts.
   ``At present, there are no uniform or minimally acceptable
federal standards for proficiency testing programs,'' said HCFA
Administrator William L. Roper. ``Program criteria and grading
standards vary widely. Our regulatory reform initiative will
resolve these problems.''
   HCFA had previously disclosed its plans to propose the new
standards, which include:
   _A uniform national proficiency testing program developed by the
Centers for Disease Control with specific standards for such things
as throat and urine cultures and glucose and cholesterol tests.
   _Options for required proficiency testing for Pap Smears and
tougher rescreening requirements for negative Pap Smears,
especially those performed for women in high-risk categories. The
proposal seeks comment on whether the final regulation also should
get into workload criteria for individuals who screen Pap Smear
slides.
   _Revised rules to ensure that lab workers are qualified, with
additional requirements for lab directors.
   _A new requirement that individual labs establish their own
quality assurance programs.

<HEAD>House Votes Tenfold Increase In Industry Liability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted 346-54 Tuesday to require a
tenfold increase in the amount power companies must pay to victims
of an accident at a nuclear generating plant.
   Despite the proposed jump, however, critics inside and outside
Congress blasted the plan as corporate bailout that would still
leave taxpayers and victims footing most of the liability costs of
a major nuclear accident.
   The legislation, expected to win Senate approval, is a 15-year
renewal of the Price-Anderson Act, the unique law that limits the
amount the nuclear power industry would have to pay in damages to
accident victims.
   The law, first enacted in 1957, expired a year ago. It is the
only federal statute setting a cap on how much an industry would
have to pay to victims _ in this case $710 million.
   The House-passed plan would set the industry liability limit at
$7.1 billion, with $160 million covered by private insurance and
the rest apportioned among the nation's utilities owning nuclear
plants.
   If it appeared that damage awards would exceed the limit,
Congress would have to come up with legislation to provide the
additional money needed to compensate victims.
   ``This leaves the government and the taxpayers holding the
bag,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio. ``These corporate bailout
amendments ... perpetuate the most egregious form of taxpayer
support imaginable.''
   Also attacking the legislation was Public Citizen, the Ralph
Nader-founded organization that said government studies have
suggested that a catastrophic accident at a nuclear power plant
could cause $100 billion or more in damages.
   ``The Price-Anderson Act is a multibillion-dollar annual
windfall for the nuclear industry which distorts the energy
marketplace, encourages unsafe nuclear facilities, and dumps the
risk of a major accident in the lap of federal taxpayers or the
victims themselves,'' the organization's Ken Bossong said in a
prepared statement.
   Steve Unglesbee, director of legislation communications for the
American Nuclear Energy Council, an industry group, said in an
interview that the legislation is ``a big step forward in
compensation'' for victims.
   Unglesbee said he did not think that the law's renewal by itself
would signal a revitalization of the nuclear power industry, which
has appeared almost moribund in recent years.
   To do this, the federal government must streamline the process
for licensing new nuclear generators and settle on a standardized
design for nuclear plants, according to Unglesbee.
   Barring an accident requiring industry payments to victims,
renewal of the compensation-limit law is not expected to affect
homeowners' electricity rates very much because liability insurance
costs are a small part of a utility's operating expenses.

   A senior Iraqi envoy declared Tuesday that
his government will reject any attempt by the United Nations to
impose a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war with Iraq without
previous consent from Baghdad.
   ``We will not accept a fait accompli, no matter in what form or
from which quarter it comes,'' said Riyadh al-Qaysi, Iraq's former
U.N. ambassador and now a member of the Iraqi delegation to U.N.
peace talks.
   Qaysi repeated Iraq's demand for face-to-face talks with Iran
before any truce. He said Iran's insistence on an immediate
cease-fire and rejection of direct talks at this time shows ``what
they are aiming at is simply a cease-fire which they so urgently
need after their successive defeats.''
   He said, ``We shall never give the Iranians that chance (to use
a truce to regroup).''
   Qaysi was reacting to reports that Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar might unilaterally declare a cease-fire in the
war, even if Iraq rejects it. That would increase pressure on Iraq
to agree to an early peace settlement and drop its demand for
direct talks.
   But Perez de Cuellar later told reporters, ``I am prepared to
continue discussions with all parties concerned and I think `fait
accompli' is a little of imagination of those who use the word and
don't know what it means.''
   He and U.N. officials emphasized Tuesday that the U.N. chief did
not intend to declare a cease-fire unilaterally, although he has
the power to do so.
   They said he would consult first with the head of U.N.
cease-fire fact-finding team, Gen. Martin Vadset, who arrives
Thursday from the region, then the Security Council and possibly
the foreign ministers of Iraq and Iran.
   Perez de Cuellar held no official meetings Tuesday with Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati or Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz. He has been seeing them since last week.
   On Monday night Perez de Cuellar told reporters, ``Listen, D-Day
(the day a cease-fire begins) does not depend on the parties.''
   Asked if he might announce D-Day if Iraq remains opposed, the
U.N. chief said: ``That is a decision which I have to take in any
case in consultation with the members of the Security Council.''
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters on Tuesday he may be in touch
with the Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers as well.
   Iran rejects direct talks with Iraq before a cease-fire, troop
withdrawal and prisoner exchange.
   Iranian Mission spokesman Amir Zamani told reporters Tuesday
that Qaysi's statement was ``a demagogic argument'' because it
claims Iran does not seek a lasting peace, only a temporary truce.
   An estimated million people have died in the Iran-Iraq war that
began in September 1980.
   Iran resisted for a year a U.N. Security Council demand for a
cease-fire, but last July 18, the Tehran government abruptly
announced it would go along. Now it accuses Iraq of procrastinating.
   Qaysi said that Resolution 598 ``is not simply a cease-fire. It
is a peace plan and that has to be negotiated face-to-face to test
the real intentions of Iran.''
   On Tuesday Francois Giuliani, spokesman for the
secretary-general, told reporters the U.N. chief does not intend to
act unilaterally. ``Theoretically he can do so; practically he will
consult.''
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati reaffirmed Tuesday
that his government thinks the secretary-general is obliged to
declare a D-Day to begin a cease-fire, even if Iraq is opposed.
   Mahallati said the Security Council should consider imposing an
arms embargo against Iraq if it does not accept a truce. He also
said the council should act swiftly to condemn Iraq by name for
repeated and large-scale use of outlawed chemical weapons.

<HEAD>President Of Cyprus Disavows Union With Greece</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus pledged
Tuesday his country would not seek union with Greece if Turkish
troops departed.
   ``The concept of union with Greece is not anymore considered a
realistic objective,'' Vassiliou said at a news conference.
   Turkey invaded the island in 1974 ostensibly to protect the
minority Turkish Cypriot population against the possibility that
Cyprus would unite with Greece.
   Greek Cypriots form about 70 percent of the country's population.
   Vassiliou said most want Cyprus to develop as an independent
country with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living in peace.
   But he stressed the estimated 30,000 Turkish troops and 50,000
Turkish settlers must leave. They are concentrated in the north
where there is a separate Turkish Cypriot state.
   Vassiliou, who met on Monday with President Reagan, has proposed
the creation of a federalized republic and the demilitarization of
Cyprus.
   He will hold talks in New York on Aug. 24 with Rauf Denktash,
leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, under United Nations
auspices.
   Vassiliou said he hoped the meeting was the first step toward a
settlement.
   If the Turkish troops and tanks depart, he said, Cyprus will
give up its right to have its own military forces and dismiss its
army of 10,000.
   ``The several hundred million dollars saved would be diverted to
economic development, especially the Turkish Cypriot community,
which has fallen behind,'' he said.
   ``Today, the free part of Cyprus has a healthy economy,'' he
said earlier in a speech. ``Our standard of living is high. We are
farming, we are producing, we are trading, we are investing, we are
growing.
   ``And I must emphasize that this near miraculous recovery of our
country was achieved in the face of the Turkish occupying forces.
But despite our success, the real potential of Cyprus cannot be
realized because of the presence of this occupation force which
prevents the Turkish Cypriot community from contributing and
sharing in Cyprus' growth.''

<BYLINE>Black Caucus Calls on Japan To End Derogatory Advertising
^By JIM STRAUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and
other lawmakers on Tuesday called on Japan to end advertising and
marketing practices that are derogatory and offensive to blacks in
the United States.
   The lawmakers accused three Japanese firms of producing products
and mannequins which show blacks in a stereotypical and degrading
light. They are the Sanrio Co., Sogo Department Store and Yamato
Mannequin Co.
   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., the caucus chairman, suggested
blacks might boycott Japanese products if changes are not made. He
said the portrayal of blacks in marketing and advertising in Japan
is insensitive and racially inflammatory.
   Dymally made public a letter to Japan's Prime Minister, Noboru
Takeshita, urging him to call a meeting with Japanese businessmen
``to formally bring an end to the negative stereotypic
representations of black Americans once and for all.''
   ``As pressure mounts for national boycotts of Japanese
products,'' Dymally added, ``it is imperative that your country
sends a clear message that it understands and is sensitive to the
political environments in which it does business.''
   Kenichiro Ide, a spokesman for Sanrio, told the Washington Post
last month that the firm's line of toys, which portray Little Black
Sambo with large white eyes and a round, black face, was not meant
to offend blacks.
   He said they should be seen in a humorous and friendly light,
adding, ``Nobody in Japan regards this as racist.''
   Sogo Department Stores and Yamato Mannequin Co. also have said
they had no racist intentions.
   Masaaki Honjo, spokesman for Sogo, told the Post the store had
no intentions of discriminating. Kauhiro Nakajima, an official with
Yasmato, said the black mannequins, ``show strong personality,
energy and charm.'' He also said that it was the company's
conclusion that the exaggerated racial features on the mannequins
were not racist depictions of blacks.
   However, members of the caucus, as well as Reps. Julian C. Dixon
D-Calif., and Robert T. Matsui D-Calif., disagreed.
   ``When officials repeatedly apologize for offensive racial slurs
by calling them `humorous' and seeing no harm done, it is not a
faux pas, an aberration, a gaffe or a slip of the tongue. It is a
dangerous mind set,'' Matsui said.
   Dixon said Japan ``is not an isolated colony that could hide
behind the defense of ignorance. It is a worldwide, economic giant
... a leader in overseas investment in an era of global travel. ...
It has the new responsibility to act like a world leader.''
   Dymally and other caucus members also complained about Japan's
becoming South Africa's No. 1 trading partner at a time when the
United States is encouraging other nations to join its partial
trade boycott against that country's white minority government.

   Officials suspended classes at
three high schools in the huge Soweto black township outside
Johannesburg on Tuesday, the day after widespread disruptions and
damage to school property.
   Students threw stones at security personnel, damaged school vans
and intimidated other pupils into leaving classes when education
inspectors arrived at the schools Monday, officials said. No
injuries or arrests were reported.
   Peet Struwig, acting chief director of the Department of
Education and Training, said he would recommend schools remain
closed until ``parents can give assurances that normal teaching can
be resumed without further disruptions.''
   Campus unrest and school boycotts occurred during the 1984-86
period of nationwide violence in most black urban areas, but
violence and boycotts have been only sporadic in the past 18 months.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest black
labor federation, reported Tuesday that 16 members of affiliated
unions had been detained in recent days. It said most were union
officials involved in labor disputes with management.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency in effect since June
12, 1986.
   In downtown Durban, police cordoned off the area and detonated a
grenade workers found in a manhole.
   Three black people were killed and five stabbed or burned when
groups of blacks attacked houses, vehicles and individuals in five
Natal province townships overnight, police reported.
   National police headquarters in Pretoria reported these
incidents in its unrest report for the preceding 24 hours:
   _One attacker was fatally stabbed during an assault on a house
in Amanzimtoti, outside Durban.
   _Two men were stabbed by crowds, one fatally, in two separate
attacks in Nhanhlakahle, near Greytown. Two houses were attacked in
the area, during which a black woman was shot to death and three
women were burned.
   _A crowd attacked a private vehicle in Hammarsdale and stabbed
one of its occupants; a bus was stoned in Georgetown, and a house
was firebombed in Sweetwaters, resulting in the arrest of a black
man.
   _A man fired at a security patrol in Kwanobuhle, outside
Uitenhage in eastern Cape province, wounding an officer.
   No further details were given in any of the cases.
   State of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and a wide range of statments the government classifies as
subversive.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The nation is beginning to see increasing
inflationary pressures, with prices rising for a wide range of
products from metals and paper to food, the Federal Reserve Board
said in a review of the economy Tuesday.
   The outlook, based on reports from all 12 regional Federal
Reserve banks, found that bottlenecks were beginning to develop in
some sectors of the economy. U.S. industry is now operating at 83.1
percent of capacity, the highest level in eight years.
   ``Capacity constraints and shortages have developed in some
(Federal Reserve) districts and materials price increases are
widespread,'' the summary of the report concluded.
   The report, known internally as the ``tan book,'' will be used
as a starting point for discussions when Fed policymakers gather in
two weeks to map monetary strategy.
   The central bank has instituted a series of small
credit-tightening moves this year in an effort to dampen growing
inflationary pressures. Those efforts have pushed a variety of
interest rates, including mortgage rates, higher, with many
analysts forecasting further tightening in the months ahead as
price increases continue unabated.
   Price increases for metals, paper and food were widely noted in
the reports from the various Fed districts. Several districts
reported shortages for such manufactured products as steel, valves,
motors and chemicals.
   ``In this environment, manufacturers are reportedly choosing to
hold higher inventories and are finding it easier to raise their
own finished goods prices,'' the report said.
   It said tight labor markets were being reported in some areas as
the current economic recovery, now almost six years old, continued
at moderate to strong levels in most areas.
   On other economic issues, the report found:
   _The impact of the drought varies considerably, even within a
state. Corn and wheat crops have suffered extensive damage, but
recent rains may be enough to save much of the soybean crop.
   _Retail sales have been generally lackluster, with only the
Atlanta and Minneapolis regions reporting any real strength. Sales
of clothing and furniture have been particularly weak, although
demand for autos has rebounded.
   _Residential construction is below levels of a year ago, but
non-residential construction showed signs of higher activity in
some regions of the country.

<TEXT>
   U.S. ``blackmail'' has not ended just
because Secretary of State George P. Shultz could not persuade
Washington's Central American allies to condemn Nicaragua, the
Sandinista newspaper said Tuesday.
   Barricada said Monday's visit to Guatemala by Shultz ``means a
new level of North American pressure and blackmail aimed at
blocking the Central American peace process again.''
   Shultz and the foreign ministers of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Honduras met in Guatemala City and issued a
declaration calling for ``peace, democracy, security, social
justice and economic development'' in Central America.
   The United States had wanted a statement denouncing Nicaragua on
grounds it had failed to comply with a Central American peace plan
the five Central American presidents signed at a meeting in
Guatemala on Aug. 7, 1987.
   Guatemala and Costa Rica opposed a strong statement, saying it
would harden the Sandinistas' position, and the final statement did
not specifically mention Nicaragua. Shultz flew to Argentina
Tuesday, the second stop on his nine-nation Latin American tour.
   Honduras was angered by the soft stand taken by Costa Rica and
Guatemala. President Jose Azcona Hoyo sent a sharp message to
President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua saying Honduras would never
form alliances with ``represive and totalitarian'' governments.
   A Honduran intelligence report, obtained by The Associated from
Honduran military sources, describing Nicaragua as a military
threat to the entire region.
   Barring a U.S. invasion, Nicaragua will remain in the hands of
the Sandinistas, the report said. It predicted the Sandinistas
would not enact democratic reforms and would grow even closer to
the Soviet Union.
   Barricada, the official paper of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, said Shultz tried to pressure the four Central
American nations into signing a ``virtual declaration of war''
against Nicaragua.
   ``Even though Shultz has failed in his primary goal of getting
the Central American governments to sell out the promises of
Esquipulas II, everyone in the region expects new pressures and
blackmail when he returns from South America,'' Barricada said.
   Esquipulas II is the name given the regional peace plan.
   In line with the plan, the Sandinistas and Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras, reached a cease-fire agreement in March. The
peace talks have been stalled since June, however, and the
Sandinistas have cracked down on internal dissent.
   Shultz is to return to Central America on Monday and Tuesday
before going to Ecuador for the Aug. 10 inauguration of
President-elect Rodrigo Borja.
   Ortega's office said Tuesday he had decided to attend Borja's
inauguration. Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Nicaragua in
1985 but is expected to re-establish them under Borja.
   In Washington, State Department officials said there are no
plans for a Shultz-Ortega meeting while both are in Ecuador. The
Reagan administration's position is that the Sandinistas should
negotiate directly with the Contras.

<HEAD>Registered Nurses Strike Six Hospitals Over Pay Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some 2,000 registered nurses demanding
higher pay went on strike Tuesday at six major hospitals, joining
nearly 1,700 service employees who walked off the job last week.
   ``We're really behind other RNs in the area, and in view of the
nursing shortage, that becomes a patient-care issue,'' said Paula
Fillari, a nurse at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San
Francisco.
   But the five hospitals in San Francisco and one in neighboring
Daly City said they would continue to provide good care despite the
first widespread strike here by nurses in 14 years.
   The hospitals said they were flying in temporary nurses,
transferring some patients and planned to restrict surgery to
emergencies and defer admissions.
   ``We have a labor pool in place to continue providing quality
patient care,'' said Terry Hastings, a spokeswoman for Children's
Hospital in San Francisco.
   The strike by members of the California Nurses Association
followed a breakdown in talks with a federal mediator shortly
before midnight Monday. The union rejected a revised offer by the
employers, and picket lines went up at 7 a.m. when overnight shifts
ended.
   Nurses, many in white uniforms, walked in quiet, orderly lines
outside hospital entrances, carrying signs reading: ``Thou shalt
not commit scabbery. Love thy nurses as thyself,'' ``Why is there a
nursing shortage?'' and ``Really needed, little noticed.''
   ``None of us like being out here. There's a lot of personal
agony doing this,'' Fillari said.
   Other affected hospitals were Children's, Marshal Hale, Mount
Zion and St. Mary's in San Francisco and Seton Medical Center in
Daly City. The six negotiated jointly as Affiliated Hospitals of
San Francisco.
   The same hospitals, along with Pacific Presbyterian Hospital in
San Francisco, were struck July 26 by 1,700 licensed vocational
nurses and service workers in a dispute over sick leave and health
benefits. Registered nurses at Pacific Presbyterian, also part of
Affiliated Hospitals, do not belong to the California Nurses
Association.
   Pay has been the chief issue in the dispute.
   The nurses group originally asked for 15 percent raises for each
year of a two-year contract but later changed its proposal to 11
percent the first year and 10 percent the next. Nurses also sought
higher pay for working on weekends and regular pay raises for
veteran nurses.
   On Monday night, Affiliated Hospitals made a new proposal that a
spokeswoman said would bring nurses parity with those working at
Kaiser Foundation hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area.
   The hospitals' previous offer included 5 percent increases for
each year of a three-year contract.
   Monday night's proposal called for a 7 percent increase the
first year with an extra 2 percent for nurses with 10 years or more
of service, a 5 percent increase effective Jan. 1, 1989, and
another 6 percent the following year, Affiliated Hospitals
spokeswoman Janis MacKenzie said. Nurses with 15 years or more
tenure would get another 2 percent in the final year.
   The nurses association, however, called the offer unacceptable
and declined to present it to its members.
   Registered nurses at Affiliated Hospitals earn from about
$31,000 to about $36,000 for day shifts and up to $43,000 a year
for night shifts.

<HEAD>Sterile Fruit Flies Released in Second Phase of Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials unleashed millions of sterile pink
Mediterranean fruit flies over a 16-square-mile area Tuesday in an
effort to breed the agricultural scourge to extinction.
   The release of 4 million sterile flies, including the afternoon
release by an airplane strafing the San Fernando Valley, is the
second phase of a two-pronged battle to get rid of the voracious,
crop-destroying pest.
   Last week, agriculture officials bombarded the area with the
pesticide malathion. Any survivors of that attack should be so
outnumbered by the swarms of sterile flies that they will mate only
with sterile flies, said Robert Donley, deputy director of the
county Agriculture Commission.
   ``They breed themselves out of existence,'' explained Donley.
   Cardboard buckets laden with sterile Medflies were carried by
truck throughout the area and released starting at 10 a.m.
   Officials will release about 20 million flies over four days
this week and continue the procedure each week for about two months
to cover two potential generations of Medflies, which have a
lifespan of about a month, Donley said. Inspectors continued to
monitor traps scattered in trees throughout the area. Sterile flies
attracted by the baited traps can be distinguished by their
fluorescent pink dye.
   ``The color isn't visible to the naked eye,'' Donley said.
``When collected in traps, they are looked at under black lights to
see if they are sterile ones.''
   The Medfly threatens the state's $14 billion-a-year agricultural
industry because it lays eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits
and vegetables. The flies usually enter the state on fruit brought
back from Hawaii by tourists.
   Six flies had been found recently in the San Fernando Valley, a
100-square-mile area that includes a number of bedroom suburbs
northwest of Los Angeles, Donley said. No new flies were found
Monday or Tuesday, he said.
   The use of sterile flies helped eradicate a Medfly infestation
last summer in eastern Los Angeles County.
   The cobalt-treated sterile flies are raised in Hawaii at a
laboratory established after California's 1981 Medfly infestation.

<HEAD>Diplomats Say Soviet, Afghan Troops on Offensive Around Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and Afghan troops are on the
offensive around Kabul in an attempt to stop guerrilla attacks on
the Afghan capital, Western diplomats reported Tuesday.
   They said 15-20 rockets had hit Kabul in the past week, killing
at least 19 people, but the number was lower than for comparable
periods recently.
   Diplomats said Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city,
probably will be the next major troop withdrawal point as the
Soviets try to meet the Aug. 15 deadline for pulling at least
50,000 Red Army troops out of the country.
   The Western sources quoted East European diplomats as saying the
Soviets already had begun leaving Kandahar. The southern city,
Afghanistan's ancient capital, is under siege by guerrillas.
   An estimated 100,000-115,000 Red Army soldiers were in
Afghanistan when the Soviets signed a U.N.-mediated agreement April
14 to pull its forces out. The withdrawal began May 15, with half
to be gone by Aug. 15 and the rest by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a
communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces were sent
to the country in December 1979.
   Diplomats said Soviet and Afghan troops, officers of the Khad
secret service and members of the presidential guard were trying to
drive the insurgents away from Kabul.
   They said the defenders moved into the besieged Paghman area
nine miles west of Kabul late last week. The town of Paghman is
said to have been abandoned by its civilian population.
   Other troop movements southwest and northwest of the city also
have been reported, said the Western sources, all of whom spoke on
condition of anonymity. Some reports from diplomats and guerrillas
have said Soviet soldiers were being brought in from northern
Afghanistan.
   Soviet officials say 35,000 soldiers have left Afghanistan since
May 15 and the diplomats say Kandahar will be the next city whose
defense will be turned over to government troops.
   Estimates of the number of Soviet troops in Kandahar range from
2,000 to 8,000.
   Azim Nasser-Zia of the National Islamic Front, one of the
strongest guerrilla organizations in Kandahar, said about 6,000
Soviet soldiers are in the area.
   Guerrillas have operated in Kandahar since the war began, making
regular forays into the city, and most Soviet soldiers in Kandahar
are at the heavily fortified airport.

   Firefighters battling Western wilderness blazes got a break
Tuesday from the weather in Montana, but lost out in Wyoming as
rain forecast for Yellowstone National Park never fell.
   In Idaho, crews turned their attention to other fires after a
5,000-acre fire sparked by a cigarette was contained. The eight-day
blaze 35 miles northeast of Boise destroyed $7.5 million in timber
and other resources while costing $1.5 million to fight.
   Firefighters in both Montana and Idaho were aided by cooler
temperatures and higher humidity, and wind in Montana was the
lightest in days, thanks to a cool front from Canada.
   At Yellowstone, rain was a failed hope for firefighters trying
to keep a 17,700-acre fire about eight miles west of Old Faithful
from moving toward the fabled geyser.
   ``It's all gone to Canada on us. We had rain forecast for us,
but it all moved north of us,'' said fire information officer Earl
LaOrange.
   Three air tankers and two helicopters toting 700-gallon water
buckets were called in as air support for crews tackling the North
Fork fire, one of several blazes involving more than 145,500 acres
of park land.
   Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to block the fire's path
toward Old Faithful, although if they failed, officials did not
think the geyser complex would be immediately threatened, said Lee
Poague, another fire information officer.
   ``The amount of fuel between the fire and Old Faithful, there's
not nearly as much fuel there to carry the fire,'' he said.
   Still, fire managers were bracing for the worst as gusting winds
fanned the flames Tuesday.
   Elsewhere in the park, crews tackled the Shoshone fire, which
had spread to 19,100 acres Monday, although about 6,000 acres
within the fire lines had not yet been burned, according to Poague.
The adjoining Lewis Lake, or Red, fire, involved 17,700 acres, of
which some 5,000 were still green, he said.
   In Idaho, firefighters faced an uphill fight against the
1,000-acre Spring Canyon II fire eight miles east of Swan Valley
near the Wyoming border.
   ``The crews had to be pulled off the line yesterday because it
was really dangerous,'' Targhee National Forest spokeswoman Lisa
Lew said. ``... They're expecting strong winds again.''
   In the Boise National Forest near Cascade, firefighters pushed
toward full containment of the 200-acre Riordan Lake fire, aided by
cooler temperatures and higher humidity.
   Fire managers in Montana predicted that the 3,200-acre Rock
Creek fire near Darby would be contained by Wednesday morning. The
fire was held in check Tuesday by 871 firefighters and the Canadian
cool front that pushed temperatures to shivering levels overnight
and produced a cool, still, autumnlike day.
   The only other major fires in Montana were in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness complex, the Gates Park blaze west of Choteau and the
Canyon Creek fire near Ovando.

   A strong earthquake rattled windows in Tokyo and
shook the metropolitan area Tuesday night, but police said it
caused no immediate damage.
   The tremor measured 5.1 on the Richter scale and was centered
six miles under the sea off the Izu Peninsula, 75 miles southwest
of Tokyo, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   It was among the strongest in a week of tremors in the Izu
region. The agency said 24 quakes were recorded Monday, most of
them minor, but seismologists said they do not expect a major
earthquake soon.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A reading of 5 could cause considerable damage in the
local area, and an earthquake measuring a 6 could cause severe
damage.

   Burma's new leadership, continuing its
campaign to stamp out dissent, arrested two aging war heroes who
allegedly plotted to overthrow the week-old government, Western
diplomats in Burma said Tuesday.
   Reports of the latest arrests came amid rumors that Sein Lwin,
the country's leader, was the target of an assassination attempt
Friday by a personal assistant who wounded him slightly in the arm
and then killed himself.
   ``The rumors are widespread enough to be taken seriously but we
cannot confirm them,'' said a Western diplomat reached in Rangoon,
the Burmese capital. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International,
meanwhile, expressed concern over the arrests last week of Aung
Gyi, the country's most vocal dissident, and as many as 24 of his
friends and political associates.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ta
Ya and Yan Nyang were arrested Monday in connection with
underground pamphlets calling for the overthrow of Sein Lwin.
   The two were members of ``Thirty Comrades'' _ a group of young
men who in December 1941 mixed blood from their arms in a silver
bowl and vowed to liberate Burma from British colonialism.
   The men at first fought with the Japanese, then switched
allegiance to the allies battling Japan's forces in their homeland.
Their leader, Aung San, negotiated the end of colonial rule and
would have become one of the country's first leaders had he not
been assassinated in 1947.
   On Monday, the government announced it arrested Aung Gyi and his
associates for allegedly ``attacking the state.''
   A list of the detainees released by the official News Agency
Burma included a number of retired military officers who had fallen
out with former leader Ne Win in the 1960s as well as Associated
Press correspondent Sein Win.
   Initial reports on the government announcement did not mention
Sein Win as one of those listed.
   Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the AP, said
in a letter to Sein Lwin, dated Tuesday, that The Associated Press
is ``deeply concerned'' over Sein Win's arrest and detention and
``would appreciate further information and a clarification of the
charges'' against him.
   Boccardi asked that an AP representative be allowed to visit
Sein Win and expressed hope the family already had that privilege.
   Boccardi said a reported charge of ``attacking the state''
against the correspondent ``does not comport with our long
knowledge of'' Sein Win.
   He said that until his arrest, Sein Win ``was in daily contact
with officials and media there in his attempt to report
impartially, honestly and accurately on the situation in your
country.''
   ``In his conversations with other AP correspondents and
executives he has made clear his determination to portray Burma
impartially and fairly to the world,'' Boccardi noted, adding that
Sein Win at times objected when he felt a news report ``did not
justly describe the situation as he knew it.''
   The U.S. State Department and other sources say as many as 25
people may have been arrested in the sweep last week. Rangoon has
only mentioned 10.
   In statements released Monday and Tuesday, Amnesty International
said the detainees ``may be prisoners of conscience held for their
non-violent, political beliefs.''
   ``At last report, they were held incommunicado without charge or
trial in Insein Central Prison, near Rangoon,'' the statements
said, adding they had not been brought before a court and had been
refused visits by lawyers or family members.
   The group quoted journalists as saying that Sein Win's recent
reporting on Burma was ``independent and objective,'' and
speculating that the reporting contributed to his arrest.
   The London-based International Press Institute, a media watchdog
group, protested the AP reporter's detention in a letter to Burmese
leader Sein Lwin, according to Peter Galliner, director of the
institute.
   Rangoon radio said the new leader had met with members of the
``central organs of power'' Monday and urged them to abide by the
law, respect human rights and review the country's run-down economy
to implement needed reforms.
   ``This new government is trying to effect some economic reform
but it's quite clear that the hopes of political reform have been
pretty well bashed,'' said one Western diplomat in Bangkok.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said students and some Buddhist monks have
been staging peaceful protests daily at Shwedagon Pagoda, Burma's
holiest shrine and a traditional center for protest.
   Pamphlets also have been circulating in the Burmese capital
calling for a nationwide general strike Aug. 8.
   Western diplomats have described Sein Lwin, who took power when
Ne Win resigned last month after 26 years of authoritarian rule, as
widely unpopular in Burma. He is blamed for ruthless suppression of
student riots in Rangoon last March in which more than 100 people
are said to have died.
   ``The unanswered question is whether the students and public can
translate distaste for Sein Lwin into action, and what response the
army will have,'' one diplomat said.

<HEAD>Suspected Palestinian Terrorist Undergoes Identity Check</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district attorney identified a man in
custody as a Palestinian wanted by the United States for a 1982
bombing of a passenger jet that killed one person and wounded 15.
   District Attorney Ioannis Lambropoulos, after a court-ordered
identity check, said Thursday he was convinced the man was Mohammed
Rashid, 39, and not Mohammed Hamdan, as the Palestinian claimed.
   ``That's who I said he was. It's now a matter for the council to
decide,'' the district attorney told reporters after the
closed-door examination.
   Lambropoulos will submit his findings to a three-member Appeals
Council to rule on the Palestinian's identity. If the Appeals Court
also identifies him as Rashid, an extradition hearing could be held.
   The United States accuses Rashid of planting a bomb on a Pan Am
jumbo jet. It exploded in Hawaii, killing a Japanese teen-ager and
injuring 15 others.
   Rashid, who also may be linked to a terrorist attack on a Greek
cruise ship three weeks ago, was sentenced July 13 to seven months
in jail for entering Greece on a forged Syrian passport in the name
of Mohammed Hamdan.
   Police theorize the July 11 terrorist attack on the City of
Poros was a botched attempt to hijack the cruise ship and force
Rashid's release. Nine people were killed and 90 of the 471
passengers were wounded.
   Rashid was arrested at Athens airport May 29 on a U.S. Embassy
tip.
   He also is accused of planting a bomb on a TWA jet that exploded
during a flight between Rome and Athens in 1986, killing four
Americans.
   According to his lawyer, Spyros Fitrakis, Rashid told the
district attorney police had arrested the wrong man, but admitted
to membership in the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The Palestinian was identified when his fingerprints were
matched with those of Mohammed Rashid, who was jailed in Greece
from 1973-76 on narcotics smuggling charges.
   Rashid did not speak to reporters as police escorted him from
the courthouse.

   A Canadian light aircraft crashed
Tuesday while trying to land at Reykjavik Airport, killing all
three crewmen and narrowly missing a crowded street, authorities
said.
   The twin-propeller Casa C-212 Aviocar transport plane, on a
flight from Goose Bay, Labrador, emerged from clouds too close to
the runway and stalled as the pilot tried to bring the nose up, the
Directorate of Civil Aviation said.
   It slammed into the ground 150 feet from a road crowded with
traffic and exploded in flames at 6 p.m., the aviation authority
said.
   The plane, owned by the Ottawa company Geoterrex, was bound for
Europe with an overnight stop in the Icelandic capital, it said.
   The identities of the crew members were not immediately released.

<HEAD>Plane's Nose Gear Collapses During Emergency Landing, No One Hurt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nose gear on a twin-engine Allegheny
Commuter collapsed as it was making an emergency landing Tuesday,
but none of the seven people aboard was injured as the plane
skidded down the runway.
   The five passengers and two crewmen had left Indianapolis
International Airport an hour earlier on the Beechcraft turboprop
en route to Owensboro, Ky. After the bumpy landing, four of the
five passengers continued on to Owensboro aboard a second Allegheny
plane, said airline vice president Mickey Bowman.
   ``The fifth passenger said he had had his fill of flying for the
day,'' said Bowman.
   Damage included the nose gear, scrapes along the plane's bottom
and bent propeller tips, said Bob Spitler of the Indianapolis
Airport Authority.
   There was no fire.
   ``Apparently the passengers were calm'' throughout the ordeal,
said Bowman.
   Roger Plymate, the pilot of Flight 3876, noticed smoke when the
motor that retracts the nose gear failed to shut off just after
takeoff.
   ``He declared an emergency and was going to land in
Bloomington,'' said Spitler.
   But Bloomington airport personnel radioed Plymate that the nose
gear was not fully retracted, and he decided to return to the
longer, wider runways at Indianapolis, which also houses the
airline's maintenance base and has more emergency equipment.
   ``There was not a lot of smoke,'' said Bowman. ``Just a smell.
He pulled the circuit breakers, which is standard procedure, and
the smoke went away.''
   After a couple of flybys so control tower personnel could look
at the plane, Spitler said, Plymate put the two main gears onto the
runway, then held the nose gear off as long as possible.
   Spitler praised the crew, saying it was ``a delicate situation
but the pilot put it down very gently and smoothly and he made it a
happy ending. They did a fine job in a difficult situation.''
   Bowman said Indianapolis-based Allegheny Commuter is a feeder
airline for USAir. It has 47 departures daily to various cities in
the Midwest.
   Bowman said he did not know what caused the malfunctioning gear
motor and did not have a damage estimate for the aircraft.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Calls for Postponing North Trial on Some Counts</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top six grafs new to UPDATE with Gesell order, picks up 7th
graf pvs bgng: ``Meantime, North''
^By JAMES ROWLEY</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra prosecutor on Tuesday
suggested postponing Oliver L. North's trial on major conspiracy
counts while he attempts to solve the problem of disclosing
classified documents in court.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, conceding the ``problems
of public disclosure are formidable and the outlook discouraging,''
urged the judge to consider trying North on 13 other charges before
taking up the three counts stemming from the diversion of Iranian
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell indicated in an order
issued later in the day that he would go along with Walsh's
suggestion. The order, which et procedures for next Monday's closed
hearing on classified documents, said the proceeding would focus
only on the 13 other charges that Walsh contends are ready for
trial.
   In his pleading, Walsh said Gesell could still hold a trial _
now set for Sept. 20 _ on all 16 counts against the former White
House aide if he relaxes a July 8 order that the CIA and other
intelligence agencies turn over highly classified documents for
North's defense.
   Gesell has ruled that North needs the material to try to show he
acted with the understanding his activities were approved by higher
authorities in the Reagan administration.
   Under the proposed procedure, ``the intelligence agencies can
continue the process of collecting and analyzing their documents to
assure completion of any additional discovery ordered by the
court,'' Walsh said.
   Meantime, North could be tried on charges that he made false
statements to Congress, obstructed justice by shredding documents,
illegally accepted installation of a $13,800 security fence outside
his home and pocketed $4,300 worth of travelers' checks from the
Contras.
   The former National Security Council aide is also charged with
tax-fraud conspiracy involving private fund-raising for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh said these charges do not involve nearly as many
classified documents. Moreover, he said, ``the criminal conduct
alleged in these counts is discrete and the allegations, far from
involving novel legal theories, are routine.''
   That statement amounted to a concession of the legal
difficulties posed by the conspiracy charge against North and three
co-defendants: former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   The four, who are scheduled to be tried separately, all are
charged with conspiring to defraud the government, theft of
government property and wire fraud in connection with the diversion
of arms-sale proceeds to the Contras.
   Gesell has threatened to dismiss those charges if the government
does not produce the documents North says he needs to show that the
Iran-Contra operation was no different than other covert operations
authorized by President Reagan.
   In a July 25 letter to Walsh, the CIA said it was willing to let
North and his lawyers inspect most of the documents. But the agency
said that details _ or the very existence _ of many covert
activities identified in North's top-secret request cannot be
disclosed in court without jeopardizing national security.
   The CIA said it would take several months to collect many of the
documents sought by North.
   In a filing last week, prosecutor Walsh said much of the
material ``can never be disclosed publicly.''
   But in Tuesday's pleading, he said the charges should not be
dismissed before he is given an opportunity to show that North does
not need the documents for his defense.
   Walsh said he could show ``no authorized covert actions
identified in North's supplemental discovery request were
sufficiently similar to the conduct charged in the indictment to
lead North to believe that that conduct would be proper.''
   Walsh said he knew ``of no analogue for the diversion (of
arms-sale funds) charged in the indictment.''
   North, meanwhile, has asked Gesell to postpone the trial until
next year to give his lawyers more time to study the thousands of
pages of documents already turned over by Walsh. The defense also
contends that North would be unable get a fair trial during the
presidential campaign this fall.
   At last week's hearing, Gesell said he was ``not wedded'' to the
Sept. 20 trial date, adding ``we cannot go forward until we
understand what we are going to try.''
   North faces the most charges in the 23-count indictment returned
March 16.
   Poindexter is additionally charged with obstructing
congressional investigations into covert aid to the Contras. Hakim
and Secord are accused of conspiring to offer an illegal gratuity
to North by setting up a $200,000 Swiss-bank account for his
children's education.
   Secord is also charged with paying an illegal gratuity by
financing the installation of North's security fence.

   Four of the six opposition parties in
the National Assembly said Tuesday they will boycott debate on a
new election law because the proposal is ``arbitrary,
anti-democratic and anti-pluralistic.''
   A boycott by the Communist, Socialist, Liberal Independent and
Popular Social Christian parties could not block the measure. The
four hold a total of 19 seats in the 96-member legislalture and the
governing Sandinistas have 61.
   The two other opposition parties, the Conservative Democrats and
the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement, hold 16 seats and are
expected to participate in the debate.
   Luis Sanchez Sancho, secretary-general of the Socialist Party,
said the proposed election law would virtually exclude opposition
parties.
   He noted the law would require a party to obtain the signatures
of 10 percent of the nation's registered voters to be considered
legal.
   Sanchez Sancho also said the proposed legislation negates
Sandinista promises of democratic reforms and defies provisions of
a regional peace accord that President Daniel Ortega and the
presidents of four other Central American countries signed on Aug.
7, 1987.
   Ortega submitted the 195-article election-law draft on July 2,
bypassing reform negotiations with the Nicaraguan rebels known as
Contras. At that time, Assembly President Carlos Nunez promised
``intense and controversial'' debate.
   National elections are scheduled for November 1990, and the new
law will replace regulations adopted by the Supreme Electoral
Council in November 1984 when Ortega won a six-year term. Most of
the opposition boycotted the 1984 balloting.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front has controlled the
government since leading the revolutionary war that ended 42 years
of rule by the rightist Somoza family in July 1979.

   Republican George Bush, hailing what ``President Reagan and I''
have accomplished, said Tuesday a new era in foreign relations
demands experienced leaders rather than ``on-the-job training'' at
the White House. Reagan, meanwhile, helped Bush on a major issue
dogging his campaign.
   In Washington, the president said he had decided _ against his
better judgment _ to allow a plant-closing notification bill to
become law. He said he wanted to end Democratic ``political
shenanigans.''
   Bush, in a foreign policy speech in Chicago, said: ``I think the
president made a good decision, and that matter is now resolved and
now we can get the focus where it belongs, on plant openings.''
   A Bush spokesman suggested Reagan's action would prevent further
efforts by presidential rival Michael Dukakis and other Democrats
to use the issue against Bush.
   But Dukakis rejected the idea that he no longer had the issue in
his battle with Bush.
   ``I don't think we lost an issue,'' said Dukakis, who spent the
day at the Massachusetts statehouse. ``I think we won a great
victory.''
   And Leslie Dach, Dukakis' spokesman, told reporters after the
governor's news conference: ``The vice president opposed the bill.
The president still said it was a terrible bill. Certainly it's
going to be an issue right through November.''
   Dukakis credited Congress, and in particular running mate Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, with forcing Reagan to make the decision.
Dukakis said the progress of the plant-closing bill and other
legislation _ all sponsored by Democrats _ had ``a great deal to do
with the attitude of the American people that they want something
different.''
   Bentsen told reporters at a news conference, ``I certainly think
that plant closing is going to remain a very strong issue and it
shows the difference, that we are for fairness in this.''
   Bentsen said of Reagan, ``I think he saw the polls, and I think
he also saw what was going to happen in the Senate.''
   Reagan said that Democrats in Congress had exploited public
sentiment on the issue. The president had vetoed an earlier trade
bill, citing the inclusion of a provision that requires a 60-day
advance notice of plant closings and layoffs involving companies
with 50 or more employees.
   The veto was upheld, but both the House and Senate subsequently
passed a separate plant-closing bill by seemingly veto-proof
margins.
   The Democrats have used the issue to suggest the Reagan
administration lacks compassion for blue-collar workers.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said Reagan's decision
would put a damper on Democratic plans ``for the political game to
be played over the plant-closing issue.''
   Dukakis has argued strongly in favor of requiring notification,
raising the issue in his speech to the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta.
   Dayton Duncan, a Dukakis aide, said Reagan's decision is a
``testament to the people around the nation who supported this
bill.'' Asked if the decision takes an issue away from Dukakis, he
said: ``Not at all. The point is that Ronald Reagan and George Bush
tried to stop it. Where is George on this? He used to oppose it.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said after Reagan's
announcement, ``Even though Ronald Reagan still occupies the White
House, we can safely say Michael Dukakis has just signed into law
his first bill as president.''
   In his speech, Bush took a sharp jab at his opponent's ability
to succeed in the White House based on experience as governor of
Massachusetts.
   ``It is not a time for timidity, hesitancy and on-the-job
training,'' Bush told the Mid-America Committee. ``This new era
demands from America, and its elected officials, firm, consistent
and experienced leadership.''
   Bush said, ``President Reagan and I'' have worked successfully
to restore American leadership since taking office and have
``repaired our nation's defenses, modernized our strategic nuclear
forces, deployed intermediate nuclear forces in Europe and restored
pride in our nation's military services.''
   The vice president, outlining his foreign policy plans, said he
would deploy a space-based missile defense system ``as soon as
feasible,'' provide support to freedom fighters around the world
and continue arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union _ but
warily.
   On the issue of freedom fighters, Bentsen on Tuesday called for
a new aid package for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels that includes
standby military supplies. Unlike Dukakis who strongly opposes
Contra aid, Bentsen has consistently voted for assistance to the
rebel forces fighting the Sandinista government.
   As Democrats met behind closed doors to work on the aid package,
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., a former Republican
presidential candidate and possible Bush running mate, sought to
highlight the differences on the issue between Bentsen and Dukakis.
   ``It is a political issue,'' Dole told reporters. ``There is a
schism between the two candidates. Senator Bentsen was right.
Governor Dukakis is wrong.''
   In his speech, Bush said the Soviet Union should be judged by
``what it delivers'' in arms reductions, human rights, immigration
and lessening of tensions around the globe.
   He spoke forcefully in favor of Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative, also known as ``Star Wars,'' which Dukakis has
criticized.
   In a comment that seemed to open up a new argument for the
system as well as challenge Dukakis, Bush said, ``It is one thing
to say you are committed to Israel's security, but in an age of
ballistic missiles, if you are against defensive systems such as
SDI, that slogan has little meaning.''
   In Boston, Christopher Edley, Jr., national issues director for
the Dukakis campaign, questioned Bush's logic, saying ``the point
makes no sense whatsoever.''
   ``Israel's security is no more an important argument for SDI
than water quality or auto safety is an argument for SDI,'' Edley
said.
   The vice president later returned to Washington where he told a
rally of ethnic leaders supporting his candidacy that he will win
because ``I can speak our language of ethnic values and pride,
everlasting pride in the United States of America.''
   ``We are the only hope for freedom and democracy in the world,''
Bush told about 200 members of the Bush-88 Coalition of American
Nationalities. ``I'll never apologize for the United States of
America, ever. I don't care what the facts are.''
   Some may wonder,``what's a nice WASP like you doing '' in the
company of such ethnic Americans as Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.;
Edward J. Derwinski, a top State Department official and former
Chicago congressman, and Joseph Evara, president of the Sons of
Italy, Bush said.
   ``We'll, it's values. That's why I'm a member.'' he said.
   Earlier, Bush's aide, Fuller, said the list of possible running
mates had been narrowed somewhat in recent days, but he gave no
further information on that issue.

<HEAD>Japanese-American League To Consider Apology Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Congress poised to approve reparations to
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II, the country's
largest Japanese-American organization will consider apologizing to
members of its own community for labeling them as disloyal more
than 40 years ago.
   Among the roughly 120,000 U.S. citizens and resident aliens of
Japanese descent who were put in internment camps during the war,
several hundred young men were labeled ``No-No boys'' for refusing
to sign a U.S. loyalty oath, forswear allegiance to Japan or be
drafted into the military.
   The No-No boys were considered disloyal and some were beaten by
fellow Japanese-Americans. Dozens ended up in prison for refusing
to cooperate.
   Now, the Japanese American Citizens League, which had urged
Japanese-Americans to enlist in the U.S. military during the war,
will consider issuing an apology to the No-No boys at its 30th
annual convention at the University of Washington this week.
   Ben Nakagawa, who is proposing a resolution to issue an apology,
was an elementary school student when his family was shipped to the
Tule Lake camp in California during the war. He said an apology
would heal wounds within the Japanese-American community at a time
when many internment camp survivors are in their last years.
   ``The No-No boys, if they're alive now, they're in their 70s,''
he said. ``I want to have them die in peace with themselves and
with their Nikkei (Japanese-American) community.''
   ``At least within our chapter, there's a feeling people like the
No-No boys ... they, too, were real heroes and victims who have
never been redressed,'' said Roger Shimizu, president of the
league's Seattle chapter.
   ``There's never been any recognition of them. And among other
Japanese-Americans who served in the military, these No-No boys
really were traitors,'' he said.
   The league meets in a week when the Congress is expected to give
final approval to pay tax-free reparations of $20,000 to
Japanese-Americans who were interned.
   Jim Akutsu was a No-No boy. Akutsu said he revolted because he
had tried unsuccessfully to enlist before the government labeled
him an alien and shipped him to an internment camp.
   ``Citizenship is a contract between the people of the country
and the government: You protect me during peacetime and I will
protect you during war,'' said Akutsu, 68, a retired Seattle city
employee.
   ``Someplace along the line, somebody breached the line and took
away my citizenship. All of a sudden, I was 4C, an enemy alien. ...
That's why I challenged it. Am I a citizen? Am I an alien? If I was
an alien, I had no obligation to serve.''
   But Akutsu said he isn't bitter about the treatment he received,
even though he spent about three years in McNeil Island
Penitentiary with 44 other No-No boys from the Minedoka internment
camp. And he said he doesn't need an apology from the league.
   ``I don't belong'' to the league, he said. ``Whatever they did,
it's their thing. Whatever I did is my thing.''

   Opposition leaders accused the military
government Tuesday of using scare tactics and creating ``a climate
of violence'' in its campaign to win the October presidential
referendum.
   Genaro Arriagada, executive secretary of a 16-party opposition
coalition, said right-wing supporters of President Augusto Pinochet
attacked its campaign offices late last month. Gen. Pinochet is
expected to be the single candidate in the ``yes or no' referendum.
   Arriagada also told a news conference the Interior Ministry gave
``its full support'' to the filming of simulated anti-government
street violence Sunday near the presidential palace.
   Actors with faces masked by kerchiefs, in the style of leftist
extremists, overturned a small truck and built barricades of
burning tires. The film crew would not talk with reporters and
police barred journalists from the area.
   ``A climate of violence is being promoted'' by the Interior
Ministry, Arriagada said. ``The filming of these spots is a
violation of law ... an apology of violence.''
   He said he believed the footage would be used in pro-government
television advertisements.
   Newspapers began publishing paid advertisements Monday with the
headline ``It Happened Just 15 Years Ago'' about violence in the
final weeks of President Salvador Allende's government. Pinochet
led a coup in September 1973 that ousted Allende, an elected
Marxist who died during the military takeover.
   Gutenberg Martinez, secretary-general of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, claimed the ads were part of a government
``campaign of terror'' and paid for with public funds.
   Carlos Cabello, leader of a pro-Pinochet organization, said the
charges were ``absurd.''
   ``We are only reminding the public that ... these same men who
now are pretending to lead us to democracy and freedom are the same
ones who 15 years ago destroyed the fatherland's roots, trying to
subject Chileans to a tyranical totalitarian dictatorship,'' he
said in an interview with the government news agency Orbe.
   The government candidate will be chosen Aug. 30 by the
commanders of the armed forces and national police, and his name
will be the only one on the ballot. Pinochet is the army commander.
   If a majority approves the candidate, he will serve an
eight-year term starting in March. If he is rejected, open
elections are to be held in 1990.

<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined
other legal experts Tuesday in applauding the growing use of
arbitration and other alternatives to litigation, saying they offer
a ``new path for justice.''
   Rehnquist told a conference of state chief justices and court
administrators that the use of non-traditional mechanisms to
resolve disputes could turn out to be ``the wave of the future.''
   ``Unless something is done to bring under control the cost of
litigation in our courts, what we now call alternative dispute
resolution may become the mainstream for many kinds of cases,'' the
chief justice said.
   Rehnquist's remarks set the stage for a series of presentations
and panel discussions on innovative procedures established by the
various states to encourage mediation and arbitration to resolve
civil disputes without lengthy court battles.
   Up to 90 percent of all civil cases are settled before trial,
said Carl F. Bianchi, administrative director of Idaho state
courts, but what is new is the ``enthusiastic packaging and
selling'' of out-of-court options for settling disputes.
   Bianchi said there are currently more than 800 such programs
around the country, ranging from ambitious state-financed systems
to a canine court in Los Angeles in which a trained animal handler
attempts to mediate disputes between dog owners and plaintiffs.
   Rehnquist said that while the federal courts are trying some
alternative dispute procedures, most of the action is in state
courts because they have the bulk of the caseload.
   ``They have to be the pioneers in this,'' he said of state
courts, adding that they can serve as laboratories in which legal
scholars can examine which methods work and which do not.
   The chief justice characterized as ``a bum rap'' the suggestion
that alternative options are tantamount to ``a second-class system
of justice.''
   Noting that ``a first-class lawsuit'' can remain tied up in the
courts for five years and conclude with a lawyer receiving more
than half the amount recovered, Rehnquist said it should come as no
surprise that many would-be litigants would prefer a different
approach.
   ``If alternative dispute resolution can provide a fair system of
resolving a claim and do it in a reasonable amount of time and at
reasonable expense, it can be the wave of the future,'' he said.
   Rehnquist also announced that he has appointed a committee of
the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by retired
Justice Lewis Powell, to look into the review process in capital
punishment cases.
   The committee will try to determine whether the combined review
process of capital sentences in state and federal courts takes too
much time, and ``whether there's coherence and rationality'' in the
process, Rehnquist said.

   Vice President George Bush and the Senate's
top Republican urged President Reagan on Tuesday to veto the
Pentagon budget bill but a leading Senate Democrat said such a step
would be a serious mistake and national security should not ``take
a back seat to election-year politics.''
   Reagan has until Friday to act and the president ``has not made
a final decision,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
``We'll have to wait and see.''
   The bill authorizes $299.5 billion in defense spending for the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which is the amount Reagan asked. But
it sharply reduced spending for the Star Wars anti-missile program
and includes some Democratic-backed arms control restrictions
Reagan opposes.
   Bush, the certain Republican presidential nominee, said in a
speech in Chicago he hopes Reagan rejects the bill. He said it is
``a bad bill and I'm convinced that the president ought to veto
it.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., met with Reagan
earlier Tuesday and said the president was undecided. But Dole's
advice was clear: ``In my view, he should veto it.''
   Later, Dole called the bill ``a Dukakis package that ought to be
vetoed.'' He said at a news conference that the bill contains a
number of defense positions advocated by Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said a presidential veto ``would be a serious mistake''
and that the bill ``will definitely strengthen our national
security.''
   ``Politics should not guide nor be the basis for national
security decisions,'' said Nunn. ``The security of the nation is
too important to have it take a back seat to election-year
politics,'' said Nunn.
   The measure ``is a good bill, one that will definitely
strengthen our national security,'' he said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
said Republicans want to use the bill ``to argue that Democrats are
weak on defense,'' but he predicted the strategy would backfire
because Democrats would unite against such charges.
   The Wisconsin Democrat said the bill ``does less violence to the
president's programs than previous bills'' that were not vetoed.
   ``Why didn't the White house veto those bills?'' Aspin asked.
``Because George Bush wasn't running for prersident, that's why.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other senior advisers to
Reagan are urging him to sign the measure, according to
congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The bill was passed July 14 by both the House and Senate. The
margin was 229-183 in the House and 64-30 in the Senate as both
Democratic-led chambers generally split along party lines. Neither
margin would be large enough to overturn a Reagan veto.
   For the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally
known, the bill authorizes $4 billion, slightly more than the
current SDI budget of $3.9 billion but far less than the $4.8
billion Reagan wanted.
   The bill also deeply reduced spending for the space-based
interceptor, which is being developed as the first phase of an
eventual SDI program. The Pentagon wanted $330 million for the
program, but the bill restricts the total to $85 million.
   The measure also requires the retirement of three aging
missile-firing Poseidon submarines as new subs are built. That
continues the policy of generally keeping the United States near
weapons limits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty, a
policy Reagan opposes.
   The bill also directs the Energy Department to prepare for a
comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goal of arms
control supporters.
   The measure bans flight testing of ``depressed trajectory
missiles'' as long as the Soviets refrain from testing their
versions of those weapons, a ban opposed by the administration.
   Fitzwater said Reagan believes the Star Wars cuts are too deep
and the measure ``restructures many of the spending priorities in
the Defense Department (and) ... ties our hands in many cases
related to arms control negotiations.''

   A Lutheran minister and a free-lance
journalist were acquitted Tuesday of violating federal law by
bringing into the United States two pregnant Salvadoran women
described by the defense as refugees.
   A jury deliberated 4{ hours over two days before acquitting the
Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert and Demetria Martinez of all charges.
   The defense billed the case as the first court test in New
Mexico for the sanctuary movement, which since 1980 has sought to
aid refugees from war-torn areas of Central America.
   Remer-Thamert's attorneys portrayed him as a religious man who
believed he could legally help two refugees under then-Gov. Toney
Anaya's March 1986 proclamation declaring New Mexico a sanctuary
state.
   ``It all came down to intent. I think this would have been a
different case without the sanctuary proclamation,'' juror
Antoinette Tellez, 23, said after the verdict.
   Juror Yvette Carrillo also said the jury was swayed by the
sanctuary proclamation arguments in the case of Remer-Thamert. She
added that jurors agreed from the start of deliberations that Ms.
Martinez was along solely as a reporter on the August 1986 trip to
bring the women to Albuquerque.
   Ms. Martinez's attorney, Tova Indritz, had contended her client
was protected by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the
press.
   Remer-Thamert, 44, was charged with one count of conspiracy and
two counts each of transporting, harboring and inducing the women
to enter the United States. Ms. Martinez, 28, was charged with one
count of conspiracy to violate immigration laws and two counts each
of transporting and inducing the women.
   Prosecutors alleged Remer-Thamert schemed with a Salvadoran
attorney to bring the women to the United States to give their
babies up for adoption and then return the mothers to El Salvador.
   They contended Ms. Martinez helped Remer-Thamert get the women
into the United States from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Prosecutors said
the defendants knew they were acting illegally because
Remer-Thamert paid a Juarez family to get the women from Mexico
into the United States and the group took back roads on the way to
Albuquerque to avoid U.S. Border Patrol checkpoints.
   The women, Ines Campos-Anzora and Cecelia Elias-Alegria, were
the chief prosecution witnesses in the two-week trial.
   The prosecution contended the women were not refugees because
they came to the United States to give up their babies for adoption
and perhaps to get jobs, and because they intended to return to El
Salvador. Ms. Campos testified she was not afraid in her native
country.
   Defense attorney Alice Hector countered that most refugees
intend to return to their native land sometime.
   Remer-Thamert said he hopes immigration authorities grant the
women refugee status and allow them to stay in the the country.
   The babies already are U.S. citizens, because they were born in
New Mexico. Ms. Compos kept her baby, while Ms. Elias' baby was
given up for adoption.
   The women remain in the United States on temporary permits from
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The courtroom was packed with family, friends and supporters of
the defendants, who gasped as the court clerk read the verdicts on
each of the counts against Remer-Thamert. The minister stood with
his attorneys, hugging one of them.
   When it was Ms. Martinez's turn to hear the verdicts on the
charges against her, she and her attorney stood with their hands on
each other's shoulders. After the acquittal, they both sat down and
wiped tears from their eyes.
   U.S. Attorney William Lutz said after the verdicts, ``We felt
there was good evidence the (Salvadoran) women entered illegally
and were transported illegally. ...
   ``But the question was one of intent and the jury disagreed with
our position on what the intent was,'' Lutz said.
   Lutz, who contended all along the case was not one of sanctuary
or freedom of the press, said the decision would have no effect on
his office's prosecution of future alien cases.
   ``Each case involves its own set of facts,'' he said.
   Ms. Martinez, who writes for the Albuquerque Journal and the

   The IRA staged a bomb attack,
land mining and killing of a part-time trooper Tuesday and warned
civilians to avoid British soldiers. A policeman also was killed
and 25 people were wounded.
   The attacks came a day after an explosion killed a soldier and
wounded nine at an army postal sorting center in Mill Hill, a
London suburb.
   The IRA's close concentration on security targets followed a
series of botched and mistaken IRA operations since last November
that killed 17 civilians and damaged the guerrilla organization's
image.
   What apparently was a land mine blew up a military vehicle in
County Tyrone, wounding six part-time soldiers; a bomb exploded
under a car in Lisburn, killing a policeman and wounding 18 people,
and a gunman killed a part-time soldier in front of his wife and
baby daughter in Belfast, police said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for all four
attacks. The almost exclusively Roman Catholic guerrilla group is
fighting to drive the British from the Protestant-dominated
province and united it with the Irish Republic.
   An IRA statement issued in Dublin, capital of the predominantly
Catholic republic, told civilians to stay away from British
military installations in Britain and Europe, and to avoid bars and
discotheques patronized by off-duty servicemen.
   ``The close presence of civilians often forces us to abandon
operations,'' the statement said. ``No one should travel close to
or with clearly identified members of the British forces.''
   Tom King, Britain's top official for Northern Ireland, said the
IRA message was ``vile and offensive.''
   ``It really is a matter of the IRA trying to give the impression
to the public that they are somehow in control of the situation,''
said Ken McGuinness, security spokesman for the Protestant Ulster
Unionist Party.
   McGuinness also told Britain's Channel 4 News, however, that the
IRA had ``given an answer'' to King's assertion last week that
British security forces were on the way to defeating the IRA.
   Police said a three-pound bomb exploded about 3:40 p.m. Tuesday
under the car of an off-duty policeman in Lisburn, killing the
officer and scattering flames and debris.
   At least 18 passersby were treated for minor injuries, police
said.
   About 20 minutes later a gunman accosted part-time soldier Roy
Butler, 26, in a shoe store in Catholic west Belfast, dragged him
outside and shot him dead in front of his wife and 2-year-old
daughter, police said. A stray bullet hit a woman bystander in the
foot and the assailant escaped in a waiting car, police reported.
   Earlier Tuesday, the military vehicle was heavily damaged by the
explosion on a road near Carland in County Tyrone. IRA guerrillas
opened fire with automatic weapons as the part-time soldiers tried
to escape on foot.
   Police said other soldiers returned the fire and the gunmen fled
across open fields. Six soldiers were treated for wounds, most of
them minor, they reported.
   Forensic experts used a hydraulic platform to help sift through
rubble at the Inglis army barracks at Mill Hill, trying to
establish the cause of Monday's explosion.
   Defense Ministry officials refused comment on reports that
security was so lax at the barracks that the perimeter fence was
riddled with holes and broken traffic barriers were unrepaired
after two months.
   ``Investigations are still very much going on,'' a ministry
spokesman said. ``Naturally, after an event like that we would be
looking very closely at our security. If there are lessons to be
learned, they will be applied.''
   Officials have ordered a security review of all military bases
in Britain.
   The explosion at Inglis was the first fatal attack in mainland
Britain since IRA guerrillas bombed Mrs. Thatcher's hotel during a
political convention in October 1984. She escaped injury but five
other people were killed.
   It was the fifth IRA attack since May on British military
targets outside Northern Ireland. Three servicemen were killed and
12 people wounded in four machine gun and bombing attacks in West
Germany and the Netherlands.
   On March 6, British commandos shot and killed three unarmed IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar.

<TEXT>
   A senior Reagan administration official
Tuesday urged Congress to reject calls by savings and loan
executives for a taxpayer bailout of their industry.
   ``From the administration's perspective, it is unnecessary to
transfer resources from the American taxpayer,'' said George D.
Gould, under secretary of the treasury for finance.
   However, others, including the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, William Proxmire, D-Wis., said the problem has grown so
large that healthy S&Ls can't alone assume the burden of restoring
the rest of the business to solvency.
   ``We are in a big, black bottomless pit,'' said Herbert M.
Sandler, chairman of World Savings and Loan Association in Oakland,
Calif.
   ``It looks like there is virtually no way we can avoid some sort
of hit on the Treasury,'' Proxmire said.
   Gould, the No. 3 official at Treasury and the administration's
chief policymaker on banking and financial issues, urged senators
not to be spooked into hasty and drastic action by exaggerated
estimates of the problem facing the savings industry, where 500 of
3,100 institutions are considered insolvent.
   Some private analysts have said it will take as much as $100
billion to restore the industry to health, but Gould dismissed
those estimates as out of line. He suggested that $30 billion, the
estimate of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Congress' General
Accounting Office, ``is not a bad number.''
   However, Gould conceded that $50 billion was not out of the
question, particularly if the oil-dependent economy in Texas, where
many of the insolvent S&Ls are located, doesn't begin recovering.
   Whatever the size of the problem, Congress should turn to
taxpayer money only after ``we ... exhaust all other available
resources,'' he said.
   He suggested that, first, Congress could expand the
industry-financed recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which began last summer.
   Savings institutions are charged an extra assessment to pay off
$10.8 billion in borrowing for FSLIC over three years. The
administration originally urged that the industry be tapped for $15
billion.
   Gould was backed by Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking
Republican on the committee, who said, ``I'm not going to ask the
taxpayers of this country to bail out fraud, mismanagement and
abuse of managerial powers'' by S&Ls.
   Pressed by senators to recommend action for Congress this year,
Gould advised only that they pass legislation forming a blue ribbon
commission to study the problem and report back next spring.
   The Senate Banking Committee endorsed such legislation last week
and a House Banking oversight subcommittee on Tuesday urged its
passage. However, the full House Banking Committee already voted
32-19 last week against attaching it to an unrelated banking bill.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
complained that the commission as proposed by Rep. Stan Parris,
R-Va., would be too heavily weighted with appointees of President
Reagan, a lame duck.
   Proxmire said he would propose bills to restrict insolvent S&Ls
from growing, a tactic critics maintain only compounds their
problems. He also advocated restricting the ability of federally
insured thrift institutions to expand into real estate and other
risky investment areas permitted by some states.
   The top federal S&L regulator, Federal Home Loan Bank Board
Chairman M. Danny Wall, said his agency already limits the growth
of insolvent S&Ls and was stepping up enforcement of the rule.
   In an interview with several reporters after the hearing, he
said he was not opposed to a move by Congress to give the S&L
insurance fund more money by expanding the existing
industry-supported borrowing program.

   A bus driver killed when his vehicle
veered off the highway and overturned had suffered a heart attack
moments before the crash, officials said Tuesday.
   Dominick Boudreau, 42, died of multiple injuries in Monday's
crash but lost control of the bus as a result of the heart attack,
said medical examiner Pat Toman.
   The tour bus was carrying 34 children and seven adults from a
private overnight camp on Sebago Lake when it careened off Maine
Route 3 near the state capital, rolled down an embankment and
overturned in some woods.
   Two campers and a counselor remained in the hospital Tuesday.
   ``I thought it was all over,'' said 12-year-old Lee George of
Philadelphia, who is spending his third summer at the camp. ``First
the bus wavered from side to side. When we hit the trees, I said,
`This is business'.''
   ``I've never been so scared in all my life,'' added Andrew
Stern, 13, of Long Island, N.Y., who sat on a steep bank above the
battered bus Monday, his T-shirt stained with blood.
   Giles Ouellette, general manager of Maine Line Tours in
Brunswick, said Boudreau did not have a history of heart problem,
and all the company's drivers are required to have physical
examinations every two years.
   Forty passengers were taken to hospitals, most with minor
injuries.
   The three still being treated Tuesday were Jared Gerstenblatt,
12, of Newton, Mass.; Alex Ney, 13, of Pacific Palisades, Calif.;
and Richard Winkler, 20, of Sharon, Mass.
   Gerstenblatt was listed in guarded condition at Kennbec Valley
Medical Center in Augusta with a broken leg and chest injuries
suffered when he was pinned beneath the bus.
   Ney, who suffered a broken collar bone, chest injuries and
facial cuts, was listed in stable condition.
   Winkler, a camp counselor, was in stable condition with bruised
lungs and broken bones.

<HEAD>Record Heat Bakes Midwest; Storms Drop Tornado in Minnesota</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Midwest baked under record high temperatures Tuesday while
cooler air stretched from the Pacific Northwest to northern
Minnesota.
   Storms peppered the edges of the hot weather area and parts of
the Southeast, with a tornado reported in the Twin Cities area of
Minnesota and thunderstorms dropping up to one inch hail just west
of Akron, Ohio.
   A high pressure system over Ohio scorched the Midwest and is
expected to show little movement, keeping the eastern Midwest hot
and mostly dry. Very high humidity combined with the heat to
produce effective heat values of up to 115 degrees in places.
   Record highs for the date included 102 in La Crosse, Wis., 101
in Alpena, Mich., 98 in Detroit and Milwaukee and 97 in Cleveland
and Madison, Wis. Rockford, Ill., tied a record with 99.
   It was the 35th day this year of temperatures of 90 or higher in
La Crosse, tying a record set in 1955.
   Ahead of the hot air, thunderstorms hit northern Ohio and
northwest Pennsylvania.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered from the Carolinas across the
Gulf Coast states to Texas. A storm generated torrential rain and
40 mph gusts near Pinson, Ala., during the morning.
   In contrast to the Midwest, cooler temperatures in the 60s and
70s stretched from the Pacific Northwest to northern Minnesota.
   There were a few thunderstorms over Minnesota and the Dakotas,
between the cool northern air and the hot Midwest.
   A tornado touched down in an undeveloped area 15 miles southwest
of the Twin Cities in Minnesota and about a half-dozen funnel
clouds were sighted in the area but did not touch ground.
Accompanying storms generated winds up to 60 mph in the area.
   Thunderstorms also developed across portions of the Southwest
from western Colorado across Utah and Arizona to the desert
Southwest.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 55 degrees at Crescent
City, Calif., to 102 degrees at La Crosse, Wis. The overnight low
was 34 degrees at Ketchum, Idaho.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
the northern border states from eastern Montana to Michigan and
from New York to Maine, with the heaviest rain in North Dakota and
northern New England. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms also were
expected over the Rockies and the southern Plateau region,
particularly the central Rockies and Arizona mountains. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms were forecast to stretch from Texas
across the lower Mississippi Vally to Tennessee, Georgia and
Florida.
   Most of the nation was forecast to have highs in the 90s. Highs
were predicted to be in the 70s along the Pacific Coast and from
the Pacific Northwest to Montana; in the 80s over parts of the
Plateau and the southern Rockies, from North Dakota to northern
Michigan, and over parts of Maine; around 100 degrees from the
central Plains and middle Mississippi valley to the upper Ohio
Valley and southern Michigan; and to between 100 and 110 degrees
across the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Government Explains Economic Plan; Banks to Stay Closed Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials explained on
Tuesday the economic changes being put in place to reduce the
budget deficit and curb triple-digit inflation, and asked
Argentines to give the changes time to work.
   Presidential spokesman Jose Lopez also announced that banks and
exchange houses, which were ordered closed for two days last
Sunday, will stay shut on Wednesday. He gave no details.
   Lopez said a 30 percent increase in utility rates, announced
Monday night, will be the only increase for the next two months.
Cutbacks in public employment will be done voluntarily through
incentives to retire.
   Agriculture Minister Ernesto Figueras meanwhile met with angry
farmers and ranchers, who may have to turn in their dollars from
export sales at a new, lower commercial exchange rate. This will
give the government access to hard currency at a lower cost.
   Figueras later told reporters, ``You will see ... Once the
confusion passes, the agriculture sector will be OK.''
   Further elements of the government's plan, which may include
devaluation, were expected to be disclosed shortly.
   ``In 30 or 40 days, we can't overcome inflation, but after this
period we will arrive at the figures given by the president of the
republic, absolutely,'' Vice President Victor Martinez said.
   President Raul Alfonsin says the monthly inflation rate in this
nation of 31 million people can be reduced to below 10 percent by
year's end. In June, the cost of living rose by 18 percent. July's
figure, still unreleased, is expected to be higher.
   Health Minister Ricardo Barrios Arrechea said the economic
changes are ``an effort to arrive by the end of the year at an
acceptable inflation rate.''
   Alfonsin has been plagued by economic problems since he took
office in December 1983. Argentina's foreign debt has risen to $53
billion. Repayment of the interest alone consumes a major portion
of the national budget.
   Inflation rose by 121.2 percent in the first six months of 1988
and by 321.7 percent from the 12-month period ending June 30, 1988.
   Financial institutions have been jittery for weeks. Unsure about
pending changes, they refused last week to sell certificates of
deposit for longer than seven days. The interest rate was 19
percent.
   The opposition Peronist Party and the 3-million-member General
Labor Confederation complained Monday that they were not consulted
about the changes.
   Alfonsin spent most of Monday at his official residence in
suburban Olivos with top advisers, including Economy Minister Juan
Sourrouille, Central Bank President Jose Machinea and Treasury
Secretary Mario Brodersohn.
   Machinea and Brodersohn returned Sunday from Washington, where
they reportedly negotiated a $1.2 billion standby loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
   The $10.6 billion budget Alfonsin presented to Congress two
months ago included a $3.5 billion deficit, and followed last
year's $8 billion shortfall.
   The budget has been blocked in Congress by the Peronists.
   While the economic adjustments under consideration are
significant, they fall short of Alfonsin's June 1985 overhaul. That
was when he introduced the austral as Argentina's currency to
replace an almost worthless peso; froze wages and prices, and put a
cap on government employment.
   Success was immediate, but temporary. Inflation dropped to its
lowest rate in the 1980s when it hit 82 percent in 1986, but that
rate more than doubled the following year.
   The economy is shaping up as the major issue in elections that
will be held next year.
   The candidate from the governing Radical Civic Union political
party, Eduardo Angeloz, is seen as having little chance of
defeating the Peronist candidate, Carlos Menem, if the situation
does not improve.

   Wyoming's crime rate has dropped so low
that some county sheriffs say it's a waste of money to keep their
jails open.
   ``It's kind of hard to justify operating a jail with no
prisoners in it,'' said Hot Springs Sheriff DeLoyd Quarberg. ``We
have to do it, but it's not efficient.''
   Quarberg was one of nine sheriffs contacted by the Casper
Star-Tribune who said they were concerned about the drop in jail
populations. Along with Quarberg, sheriffs in Sublette, Johnson,
Converse, Crook, Platte, Lincoln, Washakie and Campbell counties
said the lack of inmates was making it inefficient to keep their
jails open 24 hours a day. The state has 23 counties.
   Johnson County Sheriff Larry Kirkpatrick, whose jail had been
averaging five inmates a day, says there have been times when ``we
didn't have a prisoner there.''
   The same goes in Converse County, where Sheriff John Bey agrees
with his colleagues that perhaps the state can send some work _ and
money _ their way by paying counties to house state inmates in
county jails.
   Such a move would be ``a real benefit to both the state and the
counties,'' said Bey.
   However, state Board of Charities and Reform officials in
Cheyenne says it's unlikely that state inmates will be sent to
county jails on a long-term basis.
   ``I don't think there's a single jail in the state that provides
the services that an inmate that is sentenced for a long period of
time ... is entitled (to),'' said Don Boyer, the board's
corrections administrator.
   Such services include counseling, access to a law library,
exercise yards, and chaplains, he said.
   Sublette County Sheriff Jack Cain said he must staff his jail
around-the-clock with six employees at a cost of about $100,000
annually. The sheriff said he thought about closing the facility
but learned that would be against the law.
   Quarberg, who said he thinks he could provide the needed
services for state inmates, is upset that his jail is partially
empty while the penitentiary is releasing some inmates early
because of overcrowding.
   ``All the things that they provide (at the penitentiary), we
have in Hot Springs County,'' he said.

   Five years ago, members of the International
Astronomical Union decided to hold their 1988 general assembly in
Baltimore, expecting to see exciting new data from a spaceborne,
$1.5 billion Hubble telescope.
   More than 1,500 astronomers from around the world gathered here
Tuesday for the 20th union assembly, but the Hubble, touted as the
most powerful space telescope ever built, is still sitting on Earth.
   The 1986 Challenger accident grounded the shuttle fleet,
stranding the Hubble and leaving the Space Telescope Science
Institute here with no new data for the IAU delegates.
   ``It was to be the centerpiece of the meeting,'' said Lisa
Hooker, a spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins University, which is host
for the assembly. ``They expected to have their first views ready
by now.''
   The Hubble is scheduled for launch next year.
   Even without the new space telescope views of the heavens,
astronomers attending the first IAU meeting in the United States
since 1961 expect to have lots to talk about.
   Since the last IAU assembly three years ago in India,
astronomers have conducted the first modern investigation of a
visible supernova and studied the latest sighting of Halley's comet.
   A number of papers are expected on studies of Supernova 1987A,
the first exploding star visible in 400 years. Researchers from a
number of countries are expected to report on their results of
studies of Halley's comet, still visible to powerful telescopes
following its retreat from the sun.
   A Soviet astronomer will report on a robot spacecraft launched
recently toward Phobos, a moon of Mars. There will be reports on
observations of a variety of objects, from quasars to pulsars and
cosmic dust.
   The meeting is to end on Aug. 11.

   At least eight people died of cholera or
gastroenteritis in New Delhi on Tuesday, raising the death toll
since the beginning of July to 223 people, a city health official
said.
   The official said the deaths were reported from hospitals, where
more than 5,000 people suffering from the diseases have sought
admission.
   At least 223 people have died in the epidemic, which broke out
last month, said the city health official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Most of the victims have been children.
   The official said more than 19,800 cases of cholera and
gastroenteritis, contracted from contaminated drinking water, have
been reported in New Delhi, a city of 8 million.
   The diseases have broken out in slums where wells were
contaminated by rainwater flowing through sewers and uncollected
garbage.
   Garbage had not been collected in some slum areas for the past
three months because of a dispute over which municipal agencies are
responsible.
   Cases of the two diseases have also been reported in other parts
of India. At least 630 deaths have been reported in the states of
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Punjab and Gujarat.
   The diseases broke out after the annual southwest monsoon hit
India and the rains contaminated drinking water supplies.

   Vice President George Bush, sketching the
outlines of a foreign policy for the 1990s, said Tuesday he would
deploy a space-based missile defense system ``as soon as feasible''
and would support freedom fighters around the globe.
   ``It is not a time for timidity, hesitancy and on-the-job
training,'' he said in a dig at his Democratic presidential
opponent, Michael Dukakis. ``This new era demands from America, and
its elected officials, firm, consistent and experienced
leadership.''
   Bush extolled what ``President Reagan and I'' have accomplished
since taking office in 1981.
   The vice president, who will formally win the Republican
presidential nomination two weeks from Wednesday at the party's
national convention, pledged to pursue arms control negotiations
with the Soviet Union _ but warily. In keeping with his recent
slightly skeptical statements about Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform drive, he said Russia should be judged by ``what
it delivers'' in arms reductions, human rights, immigration and
easing of tensions around the globe.
   The vice president also took time in his foreign policy speech
to express satisfaction with Reagan's decision to permit plant
closing legislation to become law without his signature. ``I think
the president made a good decision, and that matter is now resolved
and now we can get the focus where it belongs, on plant openings,''
Bush said.
   Dukakis campaigned extensively against an earlier Reagan veto of
a trade bill that contained the same provision to require 60 days'
notice to employees before a plant is closed.
   The vice president didn't mention that issue in his speech, nor
did he discuss his search for a vice presidential running mate. On
the latter subject, Fuller said only that the list of possible
candidates had been narrowed somewhat in recent days.
   Bush suggested that development of the administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as ``Star Wars,'' might be
critical to Israel's security. In a remark that seemed to open up a
new argument for the system as well as a challenge Dukakis, he
said, ``It is one thing to say you are committed to Israel's
security, but in an age of ballistic missiles, if you are against
defensive systems such as SDI, that slogan has little meaning.''
   Aides said the vice president was likely to deal more harshly
with Dukakis in a second speech, perhaps as early as Thursday in
Texas.
   In Boston, the national issues director for the Dukakis campaign
questioned Bush's logic in the SDI-Israel statement.
   ``The point makes no sense whatsoever,'' said Christopher Edley,
Jr. ``Israel's security is no more an important argument for SDI
than water quality or auto safety is an argument for SDI.''
   ``If the vice president wants to discuss the merits of the
president's space boondoggle he should explain how SDI is
consistent with the ABM treaty, how the system would work given the
unanimous scientific community agreement that it is unworkable and
how billions more wasted on SDI will give us a stronger America,''
Edley said.
   The vice president said Reagan and he have worked successfully
to restore American leadership and have ``repaired our nation's
defenses, modernized our strategic nuclear forces, deployed
intermediate nuclear forces in Europe and restored pride in our
nation's military services.''
   As for the future, Bush said he would continue to modernize the
American nuclear force ``as we pursue a verifiable and stabilizing
agreement'' for a 50 percent cut in U.S. and Soviet arsenals. He
also called for a reduction in conventional forces in Europe.
   He blamed Democrats in Congress for dragging their feet on Star
Wars. ``I am committed to deployment of SDI as soon as feasible and
will determine the exact architecture of the system in my first
term, as the technologies are tested and proven,'' he said. ``As
president I will not leave America defenseless against ballistic
missiles.''
   Bush called a $299.5 billion Pentagon budget-authorization bill
approved by Congress last month ``a bad bill'' and said Reagan
should veto it.
   Congressional Republicans likewise have urged a veto because the
bill, though giving Reagan what he sought for the overall defense
budget, sharply reduces the White House request for Star Wars
spending and also includes arms control policy restrictions opposed
by the administration.
   Bush said he would work to increase the ``scope and momentum of
the democratic revolution'' around the world.
   ``We must support genuine freedom fighters and assist fledgling
democrats,'' he said. He made no mention of the Contra rebels
fighting the Nicaraguan government and cited no other examples.
   He also said he would try to stop the spread of ballistic
missiles around the world.
   The vice president said he would place one senior official in
charge of the U.S. ballistic missile program and give him the
overall responsibility for the ``intelligence, military, technical,
diplomatic and economic resources needed to respond.''
   Bush also said he would combat drugs internationally and seek
elimination of trade barriers around the world.
   Bush later returned to Washington and addressed 200 people at a
rally of ethnic leaders supporting his candidacy. He told the
Bush-88 Coalition of American Nationalities, ``I can speak our
language of ethnic values and pride, everlasting pride in the
United States of America.''
   Acknowledging his own ``WASP'' background, Bush said many ethnic
Americans are likely to share his support for voluntary prayer in
public schools and the death penalty.

   Twelve foreign companies have invested
in Vietnam this year, and calls are increasing for countries to end
policies of isolating that communist country, an official Voice of
Vietnam radio broadcast said.
   The broadcast said Monday that 20 foreign companies expressed
interest in a liberal investment code promulgated in January, and
that 12 companies have invested in areas including banking,
tourism, electronics and aquatic products.
   A text of the broadcast was obtained Tuesday from a Western
embassy in Bangkok.
   The radio said Vietnam also signed contracts with companies from
India, Belgium and Holland involving oil and gas surveys and
exploitation.
   ``We should recall an old proverb which goes: `It is the early
bird that catches the worm,''' the broadcast said.
   It said recent progress on resolving the Cambodian issue,
including the withdrawal of many Vietnamese troops, made it
possible for countries to end their isolation of Vietnam.
   A Thai newspaper, The Nation, has called for improving relations
and lifting a ban on rice sales to Vietnam, the broadcast said. It
quoted The Boston Globe newspaper as urging establishment of U.S.
diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
   Thailand and the United States back guerrillas fighting the
9{-year-old Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.

<HEAD>University To Open 1st Secondary School For Japanese Children in
U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first fully accredited Japanese
secondary school in the United States will open next spring at an
old military academy in east Tennessee farm country, officials said
Tuesday.
   Hiroshi Jo, managing director of Meiji Gakuin University, said
the boarding school will make it possible for Japanese children to
get the education necessary for admittance to Japanese universities
without staying in Japan.
   Many Japanese who come to work in one of the 650 Japanese
companies in the United States now leave their families behind, Jo
said, so as not to disrupt the children's education.
   He said Japanese workers in America ``want to know they can send
their children to a school without anxiety, and know they have a
chance for higher education in Japan.''
   Officials said Tuesday that Meiji Gakuin agreed to pay $2.5
million to Sanford Gray, owner of TMI Academy in Sweetwater, for
the grounds where the new school will be located.
   TMI Academy opened 114 years ago as a military school for boys,
and later became a co-educational private school. It went up for
sale early this year.
   Gray said the purchase includes the 45-acre campus and its 12
buildings, as well as an adjacent 100-acre horse farm.
   Jo said the new school will be called Tennessee Meiji Gakuin
(TMG) Academy and plans call for it to open in April 1989 with
about 70 high school sophomores.
   The curriculum will be expanded to include junior high and high
school grades in coming years, he said, with an eventual goal of
about 200 students.
   Jo said the number of Japanese employees in Tennessee was part
of the reason Sweetwater was chosen, but that Japanese children
could come from anywhere in the United States.
   Jo and Meiji Gakuin Chancellor Nobumichi Hiraide both visited
the TMI Academy campus and toured the region, Jo said. They visited
with executives of the several Japanese companies with facilities
in east and middle Tennessee, and found widespread support for such
a school, Jo said.
   ``The children often become the victims'' in the increasing
Japanese investment in the United States, Jo said, adding there are
schools for Japanese children in Europe.
   ``With the support of the Japanese Ministry of Education, we
decided we must have on in America, too,'' he said.
   Gov. Ned McWherter said the school ``will help strengthen the
close ties of culture, commerce and friendship that already exist
between Japan and Tennessee.''
   The largest Japanese employer in Tennessee is the Nissan truck
plant in Smyrna, south of Nashville. Japanese companies in East
Tennessee include ACOM, which makes Panasonic electric components
in Knoxville; Sharp; Matsushita; and Komatsu. Nippondenso recently
announced it would build a $200 million manufacturing plant in
nearby Maryville.
   Meiji Gakuin University has campuses in Shirokanedai, Higashi
Murayama and Totsuka, Yokohama. It is a Christian school founded in
1859 by a Presbyterian missionary.

<HEAD>Reports Ransom Was Paid for German Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news magazine Stern on Tuesday
quoted Syria's defense minister as saying a ransom of $9.7 million
was paid last year to win the release of a West German businessman
kidnapped in Lebanon.
   It reported Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass as saying, ``The
ransom for Siemens technician Alfred Schmidt amounted to 18 million
marks.''
   But the West German government and a spokesman for Schmidt's
employer, the Siemens electronics firm, repeated their denials that
either had paid a ransom.
   ``The federal government has neither paid nor offered any ransom
money in the case of German hostages held in Lebanon and also does
not intend on doing that in the future,'' said government spokesman
Norbert Schaefer.
   Schmidt was released last September and at that time Siemens
said it had not paid a ransom.
   Horst Siebert, a spokesman for the Munich-based company, told
The Associated Press Tuesday, ``We have not changed our previous
statements.''
   The report in Stern did not say who provided the money or who
received it.
   Schmidt and West German businessman Rufolf Cordes were kidnapped
separately in January 1987 by Shiite Moslem extremists. When
Schmidt was released his captors said they freed him as a
``goodwill gesture.''
   Cordes is among 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, still
held hostage in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for AP, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped
in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Stern also quoted Tlass as saying that a West German-approved
``trade'' for Cordes collapsed following ``intervention by the U.S.
government.''
   He apparently referred to a possible exchange involving Cordes
and Mohammed Hamadi and his older brother Abbas Hamadi, who are
imprisoned in West Germany.
   Schaefer said the government never considered such an exchange.
   Mohammed Hamadi is on trial in Frankfurt charged with air piracy
and murder in the June 1985 hijacking of a Trans World Airlines
jetliner to Beirut. A U.S. Navy diver was killed by the hijackers.
   Abbas Hamadi was convicted by a Duesseldorf court in April of
kidnapping Schmidt and Cordes in an effort to force West Germany to
free his brother. Abbas Hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   West Germany refused a U.S. extradition request for Mohammed
Hamadi.
   A government official testified at Abbas Hamadi's trial that
fears for Corde's safety played was in important factor in turning
down the U.S. request.
   Schaefer said of the Stern account: ``If the Syrian defense
minister really said what Stern has quoted him as saying, then he
is relying on false information.''
   After Schmidt was freed West Germany said Syria helped gain his
release.
   Hamburg-based Stern made its report available to other news
organizations in advance of Thursday's publication.

   Riot police used tear gas to scatter
demonstrators who took to Khartoum's streets for a third straight
night Tuesday to protest flood-induced shortages of power, water,
bread and public transportation.
   Witnesses said the rioters burned tires on the main streets of
Khartoum, Omdurman, and Khartoum North, the three sections of this
Sudanese capital.
   Khartoum is suffering acute shortgages of electric power and
potable water resulting from the seasonal flood of the Blue Nile.
   Power turbines at Erroseiris dam and water treatment stations
were knocked out of action by huge amounts of silt carried by the
floods. Bakeries using electricity were affected.
   Torrential rains meanwhile brought public transport to a
near-halt.
   The state-owned Sudan News Agency said rains washed away
thousands of mud huts. Relief officials said canvas was being
distrubuted for use as shelter by those who lost their homes.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Dante Caputo
said Tuesday that Secretary of State George P. Shultz's visit to
Argentina underscores U.S. support for this South American nation's
return to democracy.
   Caputo told Shultz in a welcoming toast, ``We Argentines have
not forgotten the deep support received from you those times a few
tried to threaten Argentine democracy.''
   Shultz said in a return toast at the Foreign Ministry:
   ``The people of the Argentine republic have overcome great
difficulties in returning their nation to the democratic fold ...
and in establishing a social peace based on consensus and mutual
respect.
   ``For those who have followed your history, Argentina's
political achievements over the past five years are fully worthy of
the nation which gave birth to the liberator, (Jose de) San
Martin.''
   Elected President Raul Alfonsin took office in December 1983,
ending nearly eight years of military rule.
   Shultz arrived Tuesday from Guatemala, where he failed to obtain
a condemnation of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
Instead, Shultz and the foreign ministers of Honduras, El Salvador,
Costa Rica and Guatemala issued a declaration calling for ``peace,
democracy, security, social justice and economic development'' in
Central America. The word-softening reportedly came at the
insistence of Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   Caputo's mention of threats to Argentina's democracy referred to
two challenges to Alfonsin's government during the past 15 months
by factions in the armed forces. The Reagan administration on both
occasions publicly expressed its strong support for the government,
which brought the incidents under control.
   After lunch with Caputo, Shultz met separately with Alfonsin,
Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille and Carlos Menem, presidential
candidate of the opposition Peronist Party.
   Sourrouille outlined the economic reforms his government is
putting together in an attempt to reduce the budget deficit and
curtail triple digit inflation, a spokesman for the U.S. State
Department said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   Shultz is scheduled to meet Wednesday with Defense Minister
Horacio Juanarena and the governing Radical Civic Union's candidate
for next year's presidential election, Eduardo Angeloz.
   About 8,000 leftists marched downtown near Government House
Tuesday evening to protest the Shultz visit. No incidents were
reported.
   On Thursday, Shultz will travel to Uruguay, the third stop on
his 10-day, nine-country Latin America tour, and meet President
Julio Sanguinetti.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Shultz's visit to Argentina was
mainly symbolic. ``It's a way to pay attention to, and show respect
for, their (the Argentines') problems,'' he said.
   The spokesman also said Shultz did not bring any new debt
repayment proposals or offers of financial assistance.
   Argentina has a foreign debt of $53 billion and currently is
paying only the interest and nothing on the principal. Alfonsin is
under pressure from his political rivals to get the country out
from underneath the debt burden.
   Menem, chosen as the presidential candidate of the opposition
Peronists in a party election last month, has suggested that
Argentina ask its creditors for a five-year grace period during
which ``not a single dollar would leave Argentina.''
   In Managua, Nicaragua, the official Sandinista newspaper
Barricada said Shultz had failed to persuade Washington's Central
American allies to condemn Nicaragua but U.S. pressure would
continue.
   It said the one-day visit to Guatemala by Shultz ``means a new
level of North American pressure and blackmail aimed at blocking
the Central American peace process again.'' That referred to the
regional peace plan signed by the presidents of the five Central
American countries at a meeting in Guatemala Aug. 7, 1987.
   The United States, which supports Nicaraguan rebels known as
Contras in their fight to overthrow the government, claims the
Sandinistas have not complied with provisions of the plan.

   The Japanese submarine that collided with a sport
fishing boat in Tokyo Bay last month, killing 30 people aboard the
boat, tried to veer out of the way much later than its captain
testified, a news report said Tuesday.
   Kyodo News Service quoted unidentified officials of the Maritime
Safety Agency as saying the submarine began turning when it was
about 650 feet from the No. 1 Fujimaru, a charter fishing boat.
   Keisuke Yamashita, captain of the Self-Defense Force submarine
Nadashio, told investigators the submarine began turning when it
was slightly less than 2,000 to about 2,230 feet from the fishing
boat, Kyodo said.
   The two vessels collided at the mouth of Tokyo Bay on July 23,
sending the No. 1 Fujimaru to the seabed in less than two minutes
with most of its 48 passengers and crew. Eighteen people survived.
The submarine reported no casualties.
   Witnesses have said the Nadashio was proceeding recklessly fast
in a busy sea lane and was distracted by a yacht approaching from
the other side, and that its crew was slow in pulling victims from
the water.

<TEXT>
   Presidents Jose Sarney of Brazil and
Victor Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia signed accords Tuesday to share
intelligence information in anti-drug efforts and to trade natural
gas and petroleum byproducts.
   Sarney, on a three-day visit to South America's poorest country,
called the agreements ``historic ... not only for Bolivia but for
all of South America.''
   ``The agreements call for sharing intelligence information on
drug trafficking activities between Brazil and Bolivia, the
training of personnel to combat the drug trade'' and increased
anti-drug border controls, Sarney told a news conference after the
signings.
   Under the agreements, Bolivia will sell 3 million cubic meters
of natural gas to Brazil daily for 25 years. Sales are to begin in
1992, when Bolivia's contract to sell natural gas to Argentina
expires.
   Conditions for the sale would be agreed upon within 180 days,
Bolivia's Foreign Ministry said. Natural gas provides $350 million
of Bolivia's annual $470 million in export earnings, the Central
Bank said.
   Brazil also agreed to help Bolivia build a fertilizer and
hydroelectric plant near the Brazil-Bolivia border and assured
Bolivia a market for agricultural and petroleum byproducts for 25
years.
   The two neighbors also agreed to build roads and railroads that
would increase commercial links. One railroad under consideration
would connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

<HEAD>Lady Bing Hospitalized in Psychiatric Ward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lady Carroll Douglass Bing, wife of former
Metropolitan Opera impresario Sir Rudolf Bing, has been
hospitalized in a psychiatric ward for the past two weeks, her
lawyer said Tuesday.
   ``She's at St. Luke's,'' said lawyer Harvey Sladkus, referring
to a private hospital in Manhattan.
   He said police took her to the hospital July 17 and she was
admitted after ``an incident involving some friends of hers. What
the incident was, I don't know.''
   ``She's an emotionally fragile lady,'' Sladkus said. He blamed
her current instability on attempts by Bing's lawyers to annul her
marriage.
   The Bings were married in January 1987 in Maclean, Va. Bing's
lawyers are trying to get the marriage annulled on the ground that
the 86-year-old former opera general manager, who has Alzheimer's
disease, did not know what he was doing.
   On May 9, state Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick ordered a
psychiatric examination of Lady Bing at her lawyer's request
because of her apparent inability to follow the court's directions.
   That same day the judge ordered Lady Bing, 48, to leave her
husband's Essex House apartment for six specific hours each day so
nurses could attend to Bing.
   ``My client has lost touch with reality,'' Sladkus told the
judge.
   Sladkus said he was told of Lady Bing's hospitalization by her
sister, Dianne, who called from her home in Washington, D.C. He
said he has no idea how long she will stay at St. Luke's. ``That's
a medical determination,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Sladkus said, he has asked that the judge stay all
annulment proceedings until doctors say Lady Bing is able to defend
herself. He said the judge scheduled further proceedings in the
case for Aug. 10.

<HEAD>Rain Helped, But Farmers Fear Return Of `Blowtorch' Conditions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS Twin Cities temperature record in 6th graf
`Scorching temperatures...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A spate of showers has brought short-term relief to some of the
nation's scorched crops, but farmers fear the return of
``blowtorch'' heat will blast what is left in their fields before
the fall harvest.
   And the drought may threaten next year's crops as well, experts
say.
   Scattered rainfall helped some fields, came too late to reverse
drought damage in others and missed parts of the Farm Belt
entirely. Following the showers, glaring, cloudless skies and
temperatures near 100 degrees have returned.
   ``I'd say we're in a real blowtorch pressure-cooker right now,''
said Indiana farmer Dan Donathen, who has 300 acres of corn and
soybeans in St. Joseph County.
   ``We've never had temperatures like this that I can recall. I'd
say we're going downhill real quick if it stays hot.''
   Scorching temperatures toppled records in Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Michigan and Illinois Tuesday. La Crosse, Wis., set a record for
the date of 102 degrees and tied a record set in 1955 with its 35th
day of 90 degree or hotter weather this summer. In Minnesota, the
Twin Cities set a mark with 99 degrees.
   Chicago hit 100, the seventh time this year the mercury has
soared into triple-digits, a new record.
   Up to 5 inches of rain fell recently on central Illinois fields
farmed by Larry Dallas and his brother in Douglas County, but they
need more after a hot, dry spring and early summer.
   ``What corn there is, the rain helped, and we've got some
decent-sized ears,'' said Dallas, who expects no more than half a
normal harvest.
   ``The soybeans perked up and grew a foot, but it gets hot and
dry again, we'll lose all we've gained,'' he said.
   ``Certainly, the drought is not over,'' said Ken Kunkel,
director of the Midwestern Climate Center at Champaign, Ill.
   ``Soil moisture reserves are very limited and it will be
difficult to fill those kernels and pods.''
   Rain soaked many fields in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and southern
Illinois in recent weeks, Kunkel said. But Iowa, western Illinois,
southern Minnesota and Wisconsin got little relief.
   The drought could threaten next year's crop production because
it has taken so much deep, reserve moisture out of the soil.
   Experts say it is unlikely that hard-hit areas will get enough
rain this year to replenish the supply. That will make winter snow
and early spring rains critical.
   ``It's going to be tough to go into the spring with adequate
soil moisture,'' said Dallas, who has 560 acres in corn and
soybeans.
   For now, some farmers are assessing the benefit of the late-July
rains.
   ``It's looking a whole lot better,'' said Kentucky farmer Homer
Hurst Jr. of Fleming County. ``We actually cut some hay yesterday.
... We reseeded 65 acres of corn and we're hoping for a late fall.
A half inch of rain a week would be a lifesaver.''
   Showers made a difference in Arkansas, too.
   ``Sorghum was heading out _ the rain made their crop,'' said
Lonoke County extension agent Blair Griffin. ``The soybeans were
just beginning to bloom. If it had continued to be dry, they would
have lost a large percentage of their crop.''
   Farmers in other states have not been as fortunate.
   ``It's the same old story: we need rain _ we're not getting
any,'' said Herb Halvorson, assistant agriculture commissioner in
Minnesota, who indicated heat now may be causing more damage than
drought.
   ``The impact on the corn and the soybeans and the canning crops
has been devastating.''
   In South Dakota, experts said rains came too late to save most
crops. The state approved a program to provide money to help
farmers and ranchers replace water supplies dried up by the drought.
   Rain in parts of North Dakota also will have limited benefit,
experts said.
   ``It's too late for most of it _ all the small grains,'' said
Morton County extension agent Jack Stewart. ``But there are some
corn and sunflowers that are going to benefit from this rain.''
   Despite some showers in July, farmers in Barron County, Wis.,
have given up hope for a second hay crop and a corn harvest, said
agriculture agent Don Droft.
   ``They're green chopping (corn) for silage,'' he said. ``They've
given up hope of getting any corn.''
   Dallas, the central Illinois farmer, said one alternative is to
sell some 1989 corn while futures prices are high, hoping to raise
that much grain next year.
   ``After seeing a year like this, it kind of freaks you out,'' he
said. ``But if we could lock in $3 (per bushel) corn for the fall
of '89, that would be good.''

   Missouri Democrats nominated Betty Hearnes, wife of a former
governor, for the state's top job Tuesday, and endorsed Rep.
Richard Gephardt's last-minute bid for a seventh term in Congress.
   Detroit voters appeared to be endorsing a ban on casino
gambling, while former congressman Jim Dunn jumped ahead of a
fellow Michigan millionaire in a Republican primary for the right
to challenge Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle.
   Gambling was on the ballot also in Missouri, where voters were
favoring a measure to raise the limit on the lottery jackpot.
   With 7 percent of the Missouri vote counted, Mrs. Hearnes, who
would be the state's first woman governor, had 25,410 votes or 85
percent and Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis area teacher, had
4,574 votes or 15 percent.
   ``It's a big step. You've got to cross this hurdle and then go
for the next one,'' Mrs. Hearnes said early in the day. Republican
Gov. John Ashcroft, seeking a second term, did not face a primary.
   Gephardt, who abandoned his bid for the presidential nomination
just in time to file for re-election, piled up 82 percent of the
vote against three little-known Democrats.
   In another Missouri congressional race, farm activist Wayne
Cryts also swamped three opponents for the Democratic nomination,
setting up a rematch with Republican Rep. Bill Emerson.
   Detroit voters were declaring for the third time in 12 years how
they felt about Mayor Coleman Young's plan to improve the economy
with hotel-casinos, and before the first votes were tallied exit
polls conducted for WXYZ-TV and the Detroit Free Press said voters
favored a ban by 60 percent to 40 percent.
   The Missouri amendment to let lottery officials use a higher
percentage of sales for prize money and advertising was ahead 3,832
votes or 55 percent to 3,097 or 45 percent with 1 percent of
precincts counted.
   In Michigan, Dunn and Robert Huber _ also a former one-term
congressman _ competed for a chance to face Riegle, who had no
primary opposition in his bid for a third term. With 4 percent of
the precincts reporting, Dunn had 9,227 votes or 62 percent to
Huber's 5,581 votes or 38 percent.
   Kansas also had primaries. The only congressional incumbent
facing a challenge, GOP Rep. Jan Meyers, tallied 85 percent of the
vote in the 3rd District to overwhelm Charles B. ``Bat'' Masterson,
73, a retired school adminstrator.

   Detroit's referendum on casino gambling generated the most heat
of any issue in Michigan. Young, who is expected to seek
re-election next year, said casinos could bring desperately needed
money into the city and help lower its 9.6 percent unemployment
rate. His position pitted him against the ministers and church
members who in the past have formed the core of his constituency.
   Voters previously rejected the idea of casinos in 1976 and 1982.
   The current measure was designed to put a law on the books that
would ban casinos from Detroit even should the Legislature someday
legalize gambling in the state.
   Huber, who was in Congress in 1973-74, and Dunn, who served from
1981-82, had little success in winning financial support, and each
spent more than $200,000 of his own money. By contrast, Riegle, who
has not lost an election in 22 years, has a $4 million warchest for
the fall.
   Dunn, 44, who ran unsuccessfully for a Senate nomination 1984,
had the support of most party officials this time.
   Huber, 65, the more conservative of the two, emphasized his
opposition to abortion and sought support from the partisans
brought into the party by Pat Robertson's presidential campaign.
   Dunn said in a radio interview last week that his opponent
regarded AIDS as God's punishment of homosexuals and drug users.
Huber, asked about Dunn's remarks, said ``I don't know whether it's
the wrath of God, but if it isn't it should be.''
   Supporters of the Missouri lottery amendment called it crucial
to the future of the 2{-year-old games. Currently the lottery is
required to give 45 percent in prizes, 45 percent to the state and
spend 10 percent on administrative costs. The change would require
only that a minimum of 45 percent go for prizes, and officials say
they want give about 50 percent in prizes.
   ``The issue is not to give the Missouri Lottery more than any
other state, but rather to put it on the same playing field as
neighboring lotteries,'' said Mike Morris, executive director of
the lottery.
   Mrs. Hearnes, 61, is a state representative whose husband,
Warren, was governor from 1965-73.
   Cryts, who nearly beat Emerson in the 8th District race in 1986,
was catapulted to fame in 1981 when he took his family's soybeans
from a padlocked grain elevator.
   Missouri will have a Senate race on the ballot in November, but
neither Democratic state Sen. Jay Nixon nor Republican Sen. John
Danforth had any primary opposition.

   The military censor on Tuesday ordered the
Israeli afternoon tabloid Hadashot closed for a week for violating
censorship, but canceled the order hours later when newspaper
officials apologized.
   Hadashot violated censorship regulations intentionally after
receiving recent warnings about previous offenses, the army said in
a statement.
   At issue was an article outlining new appointments expected to
be made by army Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Dan Shomron. Hadashot did
not submit it to the censor before publishing it Tuesday.
   Under censorship regulations, all stories relating to security
matters must be submitted to the military censor.
   Hadashot's news editor, Danny Dor, complained before the closure
order was canceled that Hadashot was being singled out.
   ``The rules are not applied equally,'' Dor said. ``When other
newsapers publish articles without going to the censor, nothing
happens to them.''
   Hadashot, with a circulation of 50,000, was founded in March
1984. A month later, it was closed for four days for violating
censorship.
   The military censor has rarely closed down Israeli newspapers,
but repeatedly applied such measures against Palestinian
publications in Arab east Jerusalem.

   Immigration officers cannot order housing
or labor camps to turn over their records of tenants to see if any
are in the United States illegally, a federal appeals court ruled
Tuesday.
   In a case from southeast Washington, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said federal law does not authorize the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to issue ``John Doe'' subpoenas _ those that
do not name a specific individual _ for records of suspected
undocumented aliens.
   Lawyers for managers and residents of the Walla Walla Labor
Camp, which resisted a subpoena for records of about 150 families
in 1984, said the tactic was a departure from INS practices of over
30 years.
   ``We felt it was a dangerous precedent as well as being a
tremendous invasion of privacy,'' said Dan Clark, a lawyer for the
residents' tenant council. ``It's a way of getting into personal
records and doing an investigation of a whole class or group of
people without any individualized suspicion or cause to justify
it.''
   ``They were basically going on a fishing expedition,'' said
Rebecca Smith, a lawyer for the tenants. ``Several times in the
past, the INS has contended its authority is broader than a number
of police agencies. This ruling shows that it's not, and that farm
workers have the same rights as other citizens.''
   Justice Department lawyer Ellen Shapiro, who represented the
INS, did not immediately return a phone call late Tuesday.
   The federally funded labor camp, operated by the Walla Walla
Housing Authority, houses mostly Hispanics. The head of each
household must document legal residence, and lawyers for the
tenants said an inspection by the U.S. Farmers Home Administration
shortly before the case arose had found no violations.
   The INS subpoena was issued by an agent who said he had arrested
about 300 illegal aliens at the camp in 11 years, 19 in 1984, and
was continuing to receive complaints about undocumented aliens who
were receiving housing benefits illegally.
   The records, sought for an unspecified ``criminal
investigation,'' covered U.S. residency, income, welfare status,
vehicles and prior tenancy of all residents of the camp.
   After the camp manager refused to turn over the records on
privacy grounds, U.S. District Judge Robert McNichols ruled in
March 1986 that the subpoena was legal. He noted that the Internal
Revenue Setvice can issue subpoenas for unnamed persons if it has a
reasonable basis to believe they are violating the tax laws, and
said the INS had equal authority.
   But the appeals court ruled 3-0 that the IRS authority was based
on express provisions of federal law that do not exist for the
immigration agency.
   ``Despite the INS's concededly broad subpoena and investigatory
authority, we are reluctant to assume the existence of the power to
issue third-party subpoenas directed at unspecified targets where
Congress has not provided for them specifically, nor provided
procedural safeguards,'' said the opinion by Judge Robert Beezer.
   Because the court concluded that the subpoena was unauthorized
by law, Beezer said, it was not necessary to decide whether it also
violated the constitutional right to privacy, as argued by lawyers
for the tenants and the American Civil Liberties Union.

<TEXT>
   A juror in the wrongful death civil
trial of Cullen Davis and a victims' rights group Tuesday demanded
that the bankrupt oil heir be retried for a 1976 shooting spree at
his remote Fort Worth mansion that left two dead and one crippled.
   Condemning Davis as a ``cold blooded killer,'' a group called
the Alliance for Justice urged Tarrant County District Attorney Tim
Curry to reopen the 12-year-old criminal case against Davis. He has
been acquitted in two criminal trials.
   ``The evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it was
Cullen Davis who killed those people,'' said Kenneth Pool, 29, the
jury foreman in a 1987 wrongful death civil trial that ended with a
hung jury.
   ``Cullen Davis got away with murder ...,'' Pool said. ``With
God's help, justice can be done.''
   District Attorney Curry said Davis cannot be prosecuted again
because the ``double jeopardy provision of the U.S. Constitution
prohibits us from any further prosecution of these cases.''
   But Alliance for Justice members noted that Davis was tried and
acquitted for murder of only one of the two victims of the 1976
shooting. They want him tried for the other murder.
   Davis, a born-again Christian, could not be reached for comment
but his attorney, Steve Sumner of Dallas, accused the group of
``tasteless, grandstand tactics'' designed to gain leverage in
civil suits still pending against his client.
   The accusations against Davis, 55, stem from an Aug. 2, 1976,
episode in which a man dressed in black and wearing a wig invaded
the $6 million Davis mansion and shot four persons, including
Davis' ex-wife Priscilla.
   Mrs. Davis, now 47, survived a gunshot wound in the chest but
her boyfriend, Stan Farr, 30, and her daughter, Andrea Wilborn, 12,
were killed.
   A mansion visitor, Gus ``Bubba'' Gavrel, then 22, was crippled
by a bullet that lodged near his spine.
   An Amarillo jury in 1977 acquitted Davis of killing his
stepdaughter, despite the testimony of three survivors who blamed
him for the murder.
   Less than a year later, Davis was arrested and accused of
masterminding a separate murder-for-hire scheme in which he
allegedly targeted for death a divorce judge, his ex-wife and
several Amarillo witnesses.
   A Houston jury deadlocked 8-4 in favor of conviction in the
murder solicitation case, and a Fort Worth jury acquitted him in a
retrial.
   After that acquittal, the district attorney's office dismissed
charges against Davis for the murder of Farr and the attempted
murder of Mrs. Davis and Gavrel.
   In 1986, Davis settled Gus Gavrel's $13 million civil lawsuit
out of court. The settlement wasn't disclosed but has been reported
to be worth about $1 million. A year later, a jury deadlocked 8-4
against Davis in a wrongful death and personal injury suit filed by
Mrs. Davis and her second husband, Jack Wilborn, the father of
Andrea.
   Mrs. Davis said she hasn't decided whether to continue the civil
action.
   Davis later filed for bankuptcy in federal court, leaving in
limbo his ex-wife's civil suit and suits filed by the Farr estate
and his heirs.
   ``I think jurors have been in awe of his money,'' Mrs. Davis
said. ``Maybe now that he's supposed to be broke they won't be as
interested in his wealth and might listen to the truth.''

<HEAD>Suit Over Church with Diocese Resolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Vietnamese-Americans
occupying a Roman Catholic church settled their lawsuit against the
local diocese, agreeing to purchase the building and turn it into a
cultural center.
   The dissidents took over the San Jose property in 1986, when the
Rev. Paul Luu Dinh Duong was appointed pastor of a temporary
mission for Vietnamese-Americans that was housed in the church.
   The protesters refused to accept Duong's authority, and said
they wanted the temporary mission upgraded to a permanent parish
where they can worship in their own language.
   Bishop Pierre DuMaine, who appointed Duong, has refused to back
down from his mission plan and has encouraged the Vietnamese to
attend services throughout the diocese.
   The dissidents sued the San Jose diocese in 1986, claiming that
the building belonged to them. The diocese bought the property for
an undisclosed sum in 1982.
   Under terms of the out-of-court settlement reached late Friday,
the dissidents agreed to pay $400,000 for Our Lady Queen of Martyrs
church. They also promised to remove all signs identifying the
building as a Catholic church or affiliated facility.
   Diocese spokesman Terrence Sullivan said the dissidents planned
to turn the building into a cultural center.
   The protesters plan to continue prayer services, religion and
language classes for children and occasional masses, said Bai An
Tran, leader of the dissidents.
   Bishop DuMaine said the settlement ``removes a major obstacle to
re-opening discussions for a reconciliation in the Catholic
Vietnamese community.''
   There are about 8,000 Catholic Vietnamese-Americans in the San
Jose area, and they appeared about evenly split over the church
dispute.
   If the group cannot raise at least $175,000 over the next 105
days for a down payment on the building, the settlement requires
the dissidents to vacate the property.

<HEAD>Judges Find Louisiana Maintains Unlawful University Segregation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of three federal judges ruled Tuesday
that Louisiana has allowed ``unlawful'' segregation to persist in
state colleges and universities despite a 1981 agreement to end
racial bias.
   ``Despite the slight increase in black enrollment statewide, the
racial polarization has increased as a whole during the term of the
consent decree,'' said the unanimous opinion by U.S. District Judge
Charles Schwartz Jr.
   The judges acknowledged, however, that part of the problem was
with the consent decree itself, an agreement with the U.S. Justice
Department that called for the state to encourage integration by
spending money to improve black colleges and universities.
   ``If money was the sole problem, then there should still be
improvement, though perhaps an insufficient improvement for
constitutional purposes, in desegregation of Louisiana's public
universities,'' said Schwartz.
   Of Louisiana's 20 institutions of higher education, Schwartz
said, those originally established as ``black'' schools _ Southern
University-Baton Rouge, Southern-New Orleans, Southern-Shreveport,
and Grambling _ remain predominately black.
   ``The court finds, except for Bossier Parish Community College
and the St. Bernard Parish Community College, that Louisiana is
continuing to operate an unlawful, dual system of public higher
education,'' said Schwartz.
   The court said drastic changes may be needed to remedy remaining
vestiges of the former segregated system.
   ``A possible remedy that suggests itself to the court would be
one that reduces the number of senior colleges and many of their
duplicative programs, in particular, the duplication in
institutions in the same vicinity, institutes a system of junior
colleges with open admissions to all high school graduates,
institutes a higher minimum entrance requirements to the remaining
senior colleges, and vests the state supervision over the
institutions to a single board,'' the opinion said.
   John Kennedy, Gov. Buddy Roemer's lawyer in the case, said the
court could order all of those changes, require additional spending
and more.
   ``We need to settle this and do it on an innovative basis.
That's what they're telling us,'' said Mack Barham, an attorney
representing the Board of Regents, which oversees all four of the
state's higher education panels.
   Lawyers for the mostly black Southern University and Grambling
University systems could not be reached for comment immediately.
   Both the U.S. Department of Justice and the state, without
admitting liability, agreed in the consent decree to dismantle the
system of higher education divided by race under state law prior to
1954, when a landmark U.S. Supreme Court outlawed segregation.
   The decree was intended to resolve a 1974 lawsuit filed by the
Justice Department against the state. The agreement was to have
expired Dec. 31, 1987, but the Justice Department extended it
indefinitely at the insistence of lawyers for the Southern and
Grambling systems.
   The court acknowledged that Louisiana has spent more than $200
million on black colleges since 1981. But the judges agreed with
the Justice Department's position that Louisiana's failure to keep
all the promises it made in the consent decree is the chief reason
segregation still exists.
   And, in a concession to an idea that was rejected by the 1988
Legislature, the court said supervision of the state's colleges and
universities perhaps should be the work of a single board, rather
than four separate ones.
   A trial is scheduled for Sept. 22 if negotiations between the
Justice Department and the state don't yield a remedy to the
consent decree. Tuesday's ruling by Schwartz and his colleagues was
part of a move to dispose of all pending motions before the trial
begins.

   China is increasing its patrols of military ships
and warplanes around the disputed Spratly Islands in the South
China Sea, the official China Daily newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Last March, Chinese warships sank three Vietnamese ships in a
clash off the Spratly chain that both countries claim. The
archipelago of hundreds of mostly uninhabited islands and reefs
also is claimed by the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia, but China
and Vietnam have engaged in hostilities over control.
   The islands range from 300 miles southeast of the Vietnamese
mainland to 500-700 miles south of China's Hainan Island.
   Geological reports have indicated there could be large oil
deposits in the area.
   The China Daily reported a senior naval officer, who was not
identified, said training exercises around the Spratly Islands,
known in China as the Nanshas, are both offensive and defensive.
   It quoted him as saying navy and air force warplanes have
increased their maneuvers in co-ordination with navy ships to
create a rapid-response force.
   Since the March clash, China has made public pronouncements and
taken military measures to back up its claims to the islands.
   Navy officials said in June that the Vietnamese had occupied 21
islands in the archipelago and China was strengthening it forces to
defend the islands.
   They alsosaid at that time that an air traffic control center
was being built on Hainan to monitor international flights over the
Spratlys and also the disputed Parcel Islands, 250 miles east of
Vietnam and 200 miles southeast of Hainan.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that a
maritime observation station had been completed on Yongshu Reef at
the southern end of the Spratly Islands.
   It said the station was China's first permanent base in the
Spratlys and was built at the request of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for the
exploration of maritime resources.

   Two alcohol tankers that burned after a
head-on train collision should have been in the rear of an Iowa
Interstate Railroad freight train instead of the front, company
officials told federal investigators Tuesday.
   The tank cars, which each contained 20,000 gallons of denatured
alcohol, were the second and third cars in the westbound train that
wrecked Saturday, killing two crewmen.
   ``They were not placed as they should have been placed according
to instructions that the Interstate Iowa Railroad had given,'' said
Edward Dobranetski of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Dobranetski declined to speculate whether correct placement
would have prevented the outbreak of fire, which forced a two-day
evacuation of 2,000 residents in the Altoona area just northeast of
Des Moines.
   Investigators also confirmed Tuesday that the crash happened at
11:45 a.m. Dobranetski said Monday that the eastbound train had
been ordered to stay in the Altoona switching yard until 12:01 p.m.
   Interviews with the surviving crewman from the eastbound train
showed the conductor and the engineer believed they had left early.
   But Dobranetski said investigators still aren't sure if the
train had left the Altoona yard because there aren't any signs
showing yard limits.
   Federal investigators plan to wrap up their on-site
investigation Friday. The NTSB is not expected to rule on the
accident's cause for six to nine months.
   Iowa Interstate officials hoped to resume traffic on the line
Tuesday night.
   The crash occurred on what is known by railroad workers as
``dark territory,'' a rail line lacking lighted signals to warn of
oncoming traffic.
   ``Signals could have prevented that,'' Dobranetski said.
   Iowa Interstate has been operating without signals because
previous signal lights were vandalized before the railroad began
running on the track in 1984, according to Dennis Shaffer, the
railroad's vice president for marketing.
   Iowa Interstate leases the track from Heartland Rail Corp.
Heartland attorney Scott Bannister declined to say whether lighted
signals would have prevented the crash, but noted that Iowa
Interstate traffic on the line is much lighter than the traffic of
the line's previous operator, Rock Island Lines.
   Neil Volmer, manager of engineering and safety for the Iowa
Department of Transportation's rail division, said Iowa Interstate
was complying with Federal Railroad Administration regulations by
running trains via orders transmitted by radio or telephone from
dispatchers.

   Missing: 730 miles of Philippine
highways. If found, contact the Philippine Department of Public
Works.
   Public Works Secretary Juanito Ferrer told a House of
Representatives committee on Tuesday that a recent survey found the
government had been paying about $400,000 a year for maintenance of
roads that don't exist.
   Ferrer said corrupt officials were apparently pocketing the
money.
   He said most of the ``ghost highways'' were in the northern
Luzon island stronghold of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
Others were in central Luzon, the central Visayas islands and
Mindanao.
   It was the latest in a growing series of charges of corruption
within President Corazon Aquino's government.
   Mrs. Aquino, who took office in February 1986, has pledged to
curb corruption, which was rampant in the Marcos administration.
   But Filipino political commentators and others claim corruption
remains widespread in the government.

   Floods caused by sudden heavy rains left 225
people dead and 449 missing and affected nearly 100,000 residents
of coastal Zhejiang province, China's official Xinhua News Agency
reported Tuesday.
   Downpours from Friday evening through Saturday poured up to 19.6
inches of rain in 12 hours on parts of five hard-hit counties
around Ningbo, a prosperous commercial city on the East China Sea.
   Xinhua said water resources in flood-hit areas were polluted and
drinking water supplies were inadequate.
   An official of the Zhejiang provincial Foreign Affairs Office,
identifying himself only as Huang, said helicopters rescued some
people stranded by floods. He said floodwaters had covered 154,400
acres of farmland. About half the waters now have receded, he said.
   The official China Daily newspaper quoted an unidentified
official of the provincial Flooding and Drought Combating
Department as saying Tuesday that those missing were ``not likely
to survive.''
   He said it was the worst flooding disaster to hit Zhejiang in 40
years, destroying 16,949 homes, 100 reservoirs and 305 bridges. He
put the economic loss at $167 million.
   It was the second storm this summer to pound Zhejiang, one of
China's richest provinces. Torrential rains in late June killed 45.
   At least 750 people have been reported killed in floods ravaging
coastal, southern and northern China this year, while wide areas of
central China are suffering from one of the worst droughts in
memory.
   Searing temperatures in Shanghai, Nanjing and other cities along
the Yangtze River have been linked to more than 500 deaths.
   Rain-swollen rivers led to two boat accidents in Sichuan
province late last month which left 103 dead and at least 100
missing.

<TEXT>
   Pentagon investigators have concluded that human
error was primarily responsible for the shooting down of an Iranian
jetliner by a U.S. warship, according to published reports.
   The official American report on the disaster that killed 290
people last month says that the sophisticated radar equipment on
board the cruiser USS Vincennes functioned well, ABC News reported
Tuesday.
   In its Wednesday editions, The New York Times said the
investigators believed the crew members' error stemmed from the
psychological stress of being in combat for the first time.
   U.S. Navy officials have said the report will not be released
before mid-August. Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty heads the team that
is investigating the disaster. Fogarty presented his findings
Monday to Gen. George Crist, commander of the U.S. Central Command,
the military organization responsible for all U.S. forces in the
Mideast.
   The Pentagon declined to comment on the reports.
   Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down in the Persian Gulf while en
route from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai. All passengers and crew
aboard were killed. Navy officials said the crew believed the plane
was an attacking Iranian fighter.
   Quoting an unnamed Pentagon source, ABC News said the report
indicates that the Vincennes' computerized records show that the
plane was traveling much more slowly than the 415 nautical mph
estimated on the day of the attack. An attacking F-14 jet fighter
would have been flying faster and lower.
   The report also indicates the plane was climbing rather than
descending toward the ship, as officials first said.
   Information on a plane's speed and altitude are not presented on
the main Aegis radar screen on board the Vincennes but must be
called up separately on a smaller screen by one of the officers
operating the system, ABC News said.
   The network said it could not immediately be learned whether the
report concluded that those in the ship's combat information center
misinterpreted the information on the screens, or conveyed it
inaccurately to Capt. Will C. Rogers III, who made the decision to
fire.
   The Times, quoting unidentified officials familiar with the
inquiry, said the error stemmed from misinterpretations by radar
operators who ``in the stress of battle ... mistakenly convinced
themselves that the aircraft they had spotted'' on their screens
was hostile.
   The investigators concluded that tension aboard the Vincennes
was particularly high because the ship had just engaged in a brief
battle with some Iranian attack boats, the Times said, noting that
the ship's crew had received extensive training but had never been
in battle before.
   The newspaper said the full conclusions of the investigators
were not known but ``it is also believed that the Vincennes crew
mistook an electronic identification signal from a C-130 aircraft
at Bandar Abbas airfield to be from the passenger airliner.''
   Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman William Crowe defended Rogers
after the plane was downed. American military officials said the
plane was approaching in an ``attack pattern'' and transmitting
military-style transponder signals.
   Iran denied both claims.
   Crowe is still convinced that Rogers acted properly on the basis
of information available to him, ABC News reported.

   Missouri Democrats on Tuesday gave Betty
Hearnes a chance to return to the governor's mansion _ this time as
chief executive rather than first lady. Voters also approved a
measure to raise the limit on their lottery jackpot.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt easily won the Democratic nomination for a
seventh term in Congress, while farm activist Wayne Cryts earned a
chance for a rematch against Republican Rep. Bill Emerson.
   In the Democratic primary for governor, with 48 percent of the
vote counted, Mrs. Hearnes, who would be the state's first woman
governor, had 201,089 votes or 82 percent and Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed,
a St. Louis area teacher, had 45,338 votes or 18 percent.
   Republican Gov. John Ashcroft had no primary opposition in his
bid for a second term.
   The lottery measure was ahead by 260,801 votes or 58 percent to
191,294 or 42 percent, with 51 percent of precincts counted.
   Supporters of the amendment called it crucial to the future of
the state's 2{-year-old games. The amendment would remove current
restrictions that now limit how much can be spent on prizes and
adminstrative costs.
   In the 3rd District, Gephardt was piling up 81 percent of the
vote against three lesser-known Democrats who had jumped in during
his run for the presidency. Gephardt filed for re-election after
folding his presidential bid.
   Cryts also swamped three opponents in the 8th District
Democratic primary.

   Under current law, the lottery gives 45 percent of proceeds to
prizes, 45 percent to the state and spends 10 percent on
administrative costs. The change would require only that a minimum
of 45 percent go for prizes.
   Ideally, lottery officials want to give about 50 percent in
prizes to make the games more competitive with neighboring states.
Lottery officials say without the changes, the games could fold
next spring when a special reserve fund the lottery has been using
runs dry.
   Most Democratic primaries for statewide posts were lopsided
affairs with one clear favorite, such as the gubernatorial primary
where Mrs. Hearnes, a 61-year-old state House member, was expected
all along to win the right to a November showdown with Ashcroft.
Her husband, Warren, was governor from 1965-73.
   Cryts, who nearly beat Emerson in 1986, gained national
attention in 1981 when he took his family's soybeans from a
padlocked grain elevator.
   Democratic state Sen. Jay Nixon was unopposed in his bid to take
on Republican Sen. John Danforth in November.

   The Reagan administration is sticking to its
formula for Arab-Israeli peace talks despite a decision by King
Hussein of Jordan to cut his ties to the West Bank.
   The U.S. plan calls for a mixed delegation of Jordanians and
Palestinians to negotiate with Israel. Even before Hussein's
statement Sunday abandoning the West Bank to the Palestine
Liberation Organization, the United States had made little progress
in trying to promote negotiations.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy, who was heading
toward the Middle East, already was scheduled for talks in Egypt,
Israel, Jordan and Syria. Now he has the added job of seeking an
explanation from Hussein and to determine if prospects for peace
talks are even dimmer.
   In the meantime, the State Department asserted Monday there
would be no immediate change in the U.S. approach to resolving the
40-year Arab-Israeli dispute.

   Seoul wants to be a clean, green
municipal machine by the time the Summer Olympics hit town, even if
it means evicting some slum dwellers and putting a lid on the
city's worst polluters.
   The city, seeking to shine during its stint in the limelight, is
in the midst of an enormous spruce-up campaign that includes
curbing its wreckless drivers and urging its restaurant patrons to
use better table manners.
   ``I find Seoul citizens quite cooperative with what the city
government is doing,'' says Seoul Mayor Kim Yong-nae.
   The South Korean capital's 10 million residents are being asked
to make more than a few sacrifices for the games, which run from
Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   Highway use, for example, will be rationed. Private cars,
depending on their license numbers, will be only allowed to drive
on odd- and even-numbered days during the games.
   In the meantime, scores of citizens have been cleaning and
painting to brighten the city, and officials say 125,000 trees have
been planted.

   President Reagan said Tuesday he will
reluctantly allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law
and accused Democrats of ``political shenanigans'' that had
jeopardized legislation aimed at curbing the huge U.S. trade
deficit.
   Without relenting in his view that requiring 60 days' notice of
plant closings or mass layoffs was wrong, Reagan conceded that
political realities rendered a veto of the bill impractical.
   ``The Senate leadership refuses to even consider important trade
legislation until final action is taken on the plant-closing
bill,'' he said.
   Reagan and his chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, accused
pro-labor Democrats in Congress of exploiting public sentiment for
a plant-closing bill to force the administration's hand.

House can accept Senate changes or try to seek a compromise between
the two versions. President Reagan has endorsed the Senate approach.

   A federal judge Tuesday imposed fines that could
bankrupt the city of Yonkers because of its defiance of a housing
desegregation order and suggested that Gov. Mario Cuomo remove
recalcitrant council members from office.
   ``There does have to come a moment of truth, a moment of
responsibility, a moment when the city of Yonkers seeks not to
become the national symbol of defiance to civil rights, heaping
shame upon shame upon itself,'' said District Judge Leonard Sand.
   Ruling that Yonkers was in contempt for not approving his plan
to desegregate housing, Sand fined the city $100 for the first day
and said the amount would double each succeeding day. After 22
days, the fines would swallow the city's entire $337 million budget.
   Sand also found three of four councilmen who voted against his
plan in contempt and fined them $500 a day. The fourth had his case
adjourned so he could get a lawyer. The judge also said the council
members could go to jail if they remain in contempt until Aug. 10.

   In February 1986, priests and nuns heeded the call of Manila
Archbishop Cardinal Jaime L. Sin and poured into the streets to
support the military-civilian uprising that toppled President
Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Corazon Aquino into office.
   The church traditionally has played a strong role in the
Philippines, where more than 85 percent of the 59 million people

   In the realm of television programming there
is no such thing as a sure thing, but if there was one it would
probably be ``Columbo.''
   After a decade off the air, ABC is bringing back Peter Falk as
the beloved, rumpled detective in a series of movies. Like other
fall shows, its debut has been delayed by the writers' strike.
   Falk told a meeting of television critics that, far from balking
at a return to the small screen as Columbo, ``I never wanted it to
go off in the first place.
   ``It was always a problem to find out some way whereby from my
point of view, we could do a limited number of `Columbos' and still
do something else, so I wouldn't spend my whole life doing this.
There were movies I wanted to do.''
   Since the show left the air in 1977, Falk has had a successful
movie career. But he still is recognized worldwide as the
character, even when he was shooting a movie, ``Vibes,'' in South
America recently.
   ``We're in the Andes Mountains, 18,000 feet above sea level,''
he said. ``And there are these little villages, Indians,
descendants of the Aztecs, very poor little hovels. I come there,
and they all run out and yell, `Columbo!'
   ``God did not design anybody to be recognized by 2 billion
people. It's something I can't get used to. Do you know what that
is, that they know who you are? You don't know who they are. ...
It's a strange thing, this television.''
   Executive producer William Link, who created ``Columbo'' with
his late partner Richard Levinson, expects ``Columbo'' to be a hit
once again.
   For one thing, he says, ``Columbo'' is still wildly popular in
foreign reruns. For another, mysteries are more popular than ever.
   Link is also the producer of the highly successful and
long-running CBS series ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   The reason ``Columbo'' remains so popular, said Link, ``is that
the format and that character met Falk, and it was a marriage made
in TV heaven.
   ``Peter brought to it I think a humanity that wasn't there on
paper. He brought an everyman quality to it.''
   ``Columbo'' will be part of a rotation series of mystery movies,
as it was in the '70s. The other two movies will be ``Gideon
Oliver,'' starring Louis Gossett Jr., and an as yet-untitled movie
starring Burt Reynolds.
   Link said ``Columbo'' will not likely get on the air before
January because of the writers' strike, and because the producers
refuse to rush the series.
   There will be no tinkering with the successful format of
``Columbo,'' he said. Each episode pits the seemingly dull-witted
detective against a brilliant killer who has gotten away with a
perfect crime until Columbo hesitates, turns and issues his
tradmark line, ``There's just one thing that bothers me ...''
   ``It's a rigid format. We're not going to change it,'' said
Link. ``There'll be no car chases, he doesn't carry a gun, still
smokes cigars, still has that raincoat that probably stands up by
itself.''
   The raincoat may even be the same one Columbo wore during seven
years on the air in the '70s, though Falk worries that the aging
and fragile garment is not as up for a new round of crime-solving
as he is.
   The raincoat became almost as big a star as Falk. One of the TV
critics was even convinced it had been enshrined in the
Smithsonian. Falk said no, the coat he bought on 57th Street in
Manhattan in 1967 is only enshrined in his closet.
   ``I have a great deal of affection for it, and I take very good
care of it. I've been known to say I put out a saucer of milk for
it every night.''
   He and Link get a little fuzzy on who is responsible for the
raincoat.
   Falk insists the raincoat was called for in the first
``Columbo'' script, based on the stage play ``Prescription:
Murder.''
   ``I would like to get that script and see, because I think it
said in the script that he wore a raincoat,'' Falk told Link.
   ``In the stage play, I remember it was a topcoat,'' recalled
Link. ``The screenplay `Prescription: Murder,' which was based on
the play _ I suspect it said a topcoat. I think you brought the
raincoat.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   INCREDIBLY SIMILAR... Executive producer Woody Fraser says his
new ABC show, ``Incredible Sunday,'' is not going to be just like
his old show, ``That's Incredible.'' Just compare the two premiere
shows: Nine years ago, ``That's Incredible'' featured a forest
ranger who had been struck by lightning seven times, a doctor who
did something Fraser can't quite recall that involved covering
seven cheerleaders with bees, and a martial arts master who stuck
needles in his body, then hung buckets of sand from them. The new
show, premiering Oct. 9, will be toned down. It will have the
Australian who claims to be the real ```Crocodile'Dundee,'' a woman
who invented magnetic underwear to protect women from exposure to
radiation, and a doctor who freezes embryos of endangered species
for implantation in surrogate mothers.

   With its European sensibilities and native
accents closer to Brooklynese than a ``Gone With The Wind'' drawl,
New Orleans hardly fits the image of a Southern city.
   The contrasts are obvious in the French Quarter, where France
founded La Nouvelle Orleans in 1718, and where nearly 200-year-old,
wrought-iron adorned brick buildings stand today, a reminder of
European style.
   On Bourbon Street, police have been known to watch quietly as
college students stumble past the strip joints, beer in hand. The
conservative American South is not always prevalent in New Orleans.
   As the Republicans arrive for their national convention Aug.
15-18, perhaps expecting a typical Southern city, other
contradictions will be evident.
   Hearty drinking is a favorite pastime, rich food is a reason for
living and pre-Lenten Mardi Gras street parties draw a million
people a year with parades a passion _ there were 281 of them in
1987.
   But all that revelry is tempered by an economic depression that
gripped the city in 1985 and hasn't let go. Joblessness hovered
around 10 percent for three years. The homeless number about 8,000.
   In the central business district, gleaming skyscrapers tower
over the modern Superdome and on the Mississippi riverfront, a
glitzy, new shopping mall shines.
   Uptown, in the Garden District, the wealthy reside in stately
19th century mansions lining St. Charles Avenue. But deteriorating
row houses are a short walk away, and the city's low-income housing
projects are plagued by crime and a burgeoning drug trade.
   The good news is that recent signs indicate the worst of the bad
times may be over.
   Local experts say the economy shows signs of a slow, fragile
recovery. A decline in business at the second largest port in the
nation leveled off last year and joblessness appears to have
peaked. It fell to 9.3 percent in June.
   The Republican convention is expected to help the recovery by
spurring $137 million in spending, prompting the Democratic
leadership of this Democratic stronghold to welcome the GOP.
   Republican nominee-to-be George Bush will be greeted by Mayor
Sidney Barthelemy, a Jesse Jackson supporter running a city where
registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 189,741 to
34,853.
   In addition, a bipartisan welcoming committee has been working
for more than a year to ensure that the Republicans' visit goes
smoothly. Still, conventioneers will do well to remember a few
facts:
   _It rains almost every day in August. The high humidity makes
the 90 degree highs feel like 100.
   _Jokes about the once-hapless New Orleans Saints football team
are no longer in vogue. They went 12-4 last fall for the first
winning season in their 21-year history.
   _``Pinch the tails and suck the heads'' is a reference to the
best way to eat boiled crawfish.
   _Some of the women strolling through the French Quarter are men.
   _Native cuisine is extremely spicy. Chicory-laced coffee is
extremely strong.
   _The Hurricane rum punch at Pat O'Brien's on St. Peter Street
tastes as innocent as Kool-Aid, but don't be fooled.

   When it comes to the weather in New Orleans,
city officials have one bit of advice for the thousands attending
the Republican National Convention.
   ``You'd be crazy not to carry an umbrella, for the sun as well
as the rain,'' says Yvonne Gelpi, a member of the city's GOP Host
Committee.
   New Orleans in August means high temperatures about 90.3 degrees
and relative humidity that rarely dives below 50 percent.
   The heat index _ a formula used by the National Weather Service
that combines both heat and humidity _ hovers close to 100.
   Perspiration doesn't evaporate in the damp air and the only
respite from the sticky heat comes in the form of brief
thundershowers that hit almost every day.
   Convention officials plan to use awnings, covered walkways and
air conditioned convention vehicles in an attempt to help those
unaccustomed to such unkind conditions.
   Hurricanes are another summer weather worry, although the storms
are more likely to threaten later in the year.
   Convention manager Bill Philips said the city would have several
days notice should a hurricane or tropical storm form in the Gulf
and head toward the city. He said plans and schedules would have to
be adjusted on a day-to-day basis to ensure convention-goers'
safety.
   But he added, ``I'm more concerned about the humidity.''

<HEAD>Superdome Once Said to Be Too Big for A Political Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans meeting in the Superdome next
week are unlikely to see a repetition of the overcrowding that kept
many Democratic delegates locked out of their party's convention in
Atlanta.
   In fact, it was once said that the Superdome was too big to host
a political convention.
   Still, the Republicans have chosen the home of the National
Football League's New Orleans Saints as the site of their Aug.
15-18 convention.
   Twenty-two lawsuits were filed when art dealer Dave Dixon
proposed building the huge domed stadium in a decaying New Orleans
railroad yard. Critics said the cost, $163 million, was too big and
the operations would be too expensive.
   But Dixon and his supporters won out, and since its opening in
1975, the Superdome has hosted Super Bowls and Sugar Bowls, college
basketball's Final Four, the Pope, rock concerts and big-time prize
fights.
   The centerpiece of the city, the state-owned stadium sits just
off Interstate 10, 280 feet high and 680 feet wide. Its off-white
polyurethane roof glows in the sunlight, its anodized aluminum
siding shimmers.
   By night, it glows underneath futuristic lighting.
   A University of New Orleans study estimates the dome has spurred
some $2.6 billion in consumer spending during its first 10 years of
operation. Still, the state of Louisiana this year will spend more
than $9 million to cover the stadium's operating deficit.
   Seating for football games is more than 69,000. With chairs
added on the floor, it expands to 97,300. Fifty-two meeting rooms
can accommodate several thousand more.
   That's a far cry from the Omni, the site of the Democratic
National Convention last month.
   The Atlanta basketball arena seats a mere 16,237. Construction
of the podium and network skyboxes reduced that to about 11,000
seats during the convention. On several occasions, the fire marshal
deemed the hall overcrowded and kept delegates and others with
credentials from entering the arena.
   GOP convention manager Bill Phillips says, however, that the
Superdome still is not big enough.
   One problem: ``It's 27 stories tall and it's got a nine-acre
ceiling _ and we don't have enough space,'' says Phillips. ``It's
all air.''
   When the Republicans meet Aug. 15-18, the stadium floor will be
divided by a nine-story tall, three-ton blue curtain that was added
sometime ago to satisfy critics who said the Superdome was too big
for some events, including political conventions and rock concerts.
   On one side of the curtain will be 27 trailers that serve as
offices. On the other, George Bush will receive the Republican
presidential nomination.
   The huge, red, white and blue $570,000 podium will be elevated
10 feet above the floor. Above the podium will be three giant
television screens.
   ``One thing we've learned,'' Phillips said, ``is you have to
make things big.''

<HEAD>More Than Money Is The Big Payoff From The GOP Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>

   The city's depressed economy could benefit to
the tune of $137 million from the Republican convention, but Mayor
Sidney Barthelemy hopes the real payoff comes later from the
benefits of international publicity.
   ``It may be our last chance,'' he said. ``Or a very, very rare
opportunity.''
   The slump in oil prices hit this petroleum center hard. Tax
revenues plummeted while unemployment in Louisiana peaked last year
at around 14 percent. It remains above 10 percent.
   The hard times hit right after the 1984 world's fair proved to
be a world class financial flop. It got great reviews but never
drew the crowds local merchants had hoped for. The fair ended its
six-month run in bankruptcy court with $120 million in losses.
   Barthelemy believes the GOP's decision to hold its national
convention in the Louisiana Superdome may signal a reversal in the
city's fortunes.
   ``I think it's already meant an awful lot,''' he said. ``We were
kind of on a down side from the world's fair as far as the national
media was concerned.''
   With 31,000 people expected, this won't be the largest
convention for New Orleans. Sixty thousand attended a religious
conference last year and 35,000 Shriners met in April.
   But the GOP convention promises to attract the most money and
the most media attention.
   To make sure the publicity is good, elected officials and
community leaders formed a host committee 17 months ago. More than
10,000 volunteers are sorting mail, answering phones and painting
signs.
   Chief executive officers from the Fortune 500 companies have
been invited to town for the convention, and helicopter tours of
industrial areas are planned for those who want a better look.
   Visiting journalists already are being flooded with information
about the state _ including a list of New Orleans restaurants that
will stay open to feed them after late-night deadlines.
   ``The city is going to be on national and international
newspapers and television for a week,'' said Barthelemy. ``You
can't buy that kind of publicity.''
   To serve as host for the convention, the city agreed to raise
about $5.5 million from private sources to pay for sound and
lighting systems in the Superdome and other construction projects.
After a slow start, collections are now said to be on track.
   If projections in a University of New Orleans economic study pan
out, the money will be a good investment.
   That study breaks down like this:
   _With each of 21,000 hotel rooms filled for an average of seven
days, hotels will rake in more than $15 million.
   _About 31,500 convention-goers are expected to spend an average
of $100 a day and generate more than $22 million during convention
week.
   _Some 200 convention staffers who took up full-time residence
here prior to the convention, some as early as March, will generate
an additional $2 million.
   _Even if construction spending is only 62 percent of what it was
during the Detroit GOP convention in 1980, it will total $15
million.
   _The host committee is spending $650,000, bringing total
projected direct spending to more than $55 million.
   On the theory that each dollar spent will be spent again,
sometimes twice, a multiplier of 1.5 was applied, adding $82
million to the $55 million for a total impact of more than $137
million.
   State tax revenue would reach $5.7 million under those
projections; city tax revenue, $4.2 million.
   By contrast, advance projections for the Democrats' gathering in
Atlanta put the impact on the local economy at about $60 million.

<HEAD>Presents Galore Await GOP Convention Delegates</HEAD>

   Cajun spices, a 629-page Creole cookbook, a
bag of grits, go-cups and strands of cheap plastic beads fill the
gift bags that New Orleans officials hope will provide a taste of
their city to Republican delegates.
   This effusion of corporate and institutional goodwill is part of
the welcome for the 2,277 delegates and thousands of alternates who
will descend upon New Orleans Aug. 15-18 for the Republican
National Convention.
   ``I hate to put a dollar value on goodwill ... but I would guess
there's about $300 to $400 worth of stuff in each bag,'' said
Winnie Beuerman, a staff member on the committee putting together
the gift bags.
   In fact, bottle stoppers, hot sauces, recipe cards, pens,
binoculars, two types of shampoo and hair conditioner, key rings
and even red, white and blue pompons forced the original canvas
tote bags to runneth over.
   A container company stepped in and provided thousands of
specially printed paper bags for grouping items in the 5,000 tote
bags, and the state Office of Tourism sent plastic bags.
   Among the items in the bags are the famed go-cups _ printed
plastic cups that are part of two of New Orleans' most popular
traditions, drinking and Mardi Gras.
   The cups first surfaced at French Quarter bars, where patrons
who departed before finishing their drinks discovered that in New
Orleans, you can take your liquor with you.
   Carnival parade groups riding the floats during Mardi Gras soon
began tossing out specially decorated go-cups, along with the famed
strings of plastic beads.
   The most notable liquids in the gift bags are the bottles of hot
pepper sauce provided by four separate companies _ enough to allow
a taste-testing for the brave or foolhardy. A fifth company sent
barbecue sauce.
   A half-dozen different companies sent spices _ generally,
all-purpose Cajun mixes. Many of those companies also included
recipe cards.
   For the cooks interested in more detailed recipes than ``open
jar and shake,'' The Times-Picayune newspaper provided its 629-page
Creole cookbook, a clothbound annotated reprint of a cookbook it
originally published in 1901.
   A local gallery also has given donated lithographs by two
post-impressionist artists.
   Some of the companies apparently gave thought to what might be
useful in the immense Superdome. Those whose seats are far from the
podium can use the binoculars while anyone who doesn't have a sign
or an American flag can shake the red, white and blue pompons.
   If the chock-full bags are still not enough, delegates can
choose from a vast collection of souvenirs being offered for sale,
including T-shirts, baseball caps, sweaters, scarves, hankies, and
even bobby socks with the GOP or convention logos.
   One T-shirt bears the drawing of an animal, half pachyderm, half
reptile and carrying a pennant that says, ``Louisiana Elegators
Never Forget to Vote.''
   There are sterling silver add-an-elephant necklaces, each $15
link a GOP logo, and a chunky white bracelet and earrings bearing
the logo. Suspenders with the words Republican Convention also are
available.
   ``Believe it or not, we've got boxer shorts,'' said David Rains,
vice president of Sports Novelties Inc. of Duncanville, Texas.
``One of them has the logo all over. Another would embarrass me to
tell you about. It's a comic design.''
   Sports Novelties Inc. is screening those companies who want to
use the logo or to sell their wares in a Convention Marketplace to
be set up in and near the Superdome.
   Perhaps the most expensive souvenir is a gold-and-silver version
of a wooden child's puzzle showing an elephant charging out of a
map of Louisiana. The map is blank except for the Superdome, which
marks New Orleans.
   ``It's going to be 14-karat gold and sterling silver. The tusks
will be gold, the feet gold,'' said Fanny M. Berdugo of Sports
Novelties. The puzzle will retail for $2,500.
   She said there will be 200 of those puzzles made and 1,000
sterling silver puzzles selling for $150 each. The 6,000 wooden
ones will sell for $40 each.
   Some retailers, however, lost so much money on souvenirs for the
1984 World's Fair and Pope John Paul II's visit last year that they
are shying away from souvenirs at the convention.
   ``We are not going to carry the Republican convention souvenirs.
We have no space for it,'' said John Salles, manager of a gift shop
just down the block from some of the biggest hotels on Canal Street.
   To allay concerns, Sports Novelties is modifying many of its
usual policies. For instance, stores can buy as few as 36 T-shirts
or a dozen glasses rather than the usual minimum orders of 144
T-shirts or a case of 36 glasses. And about 30 items can be
delivered on three-day notice, Rains said.
   New Orleans officials have a reason for supporting sales of
official souvenirs: Money from those sales will help the city meet
its $5.5 million share of convention expenses.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Prices Slightly Lower In Quiet Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of crude oil futures contracts have
dipped slightly in advance of Wednesday's scheduled meeting of
OPEC's price monitoring committee.
   The contract for September delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 23 cents to $16.08 a
barrel Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Prices of some refined products rose slightly because of
short-term supply and demand imbalances, analysts said.
   The September contract for No. 2 heating oil rose .02 cent a
gallon to 45.12 cents and the September contract for unleaded
gasoline rose .32 cent to 48.45 cents a gallon.
   William Byers, an analyst for Bear, Stearns & Co., said the
absence of news about the likelihood of a price accord by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries left traders cautious.
   ``If there's an incentive to do anything, it's to limit
exposure,'' Byers said.

<HEAD>Gillette Settles Coniston Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. has fended off another possible
takeover attempt by settling lawsuits with Coniston Partners
stemming from their bitter proxy fight earlier this year.
   As part of the settlement outlined Monday, Gillette will buy
back an estimated 16 million shares at $45 each, or a total of $720
million.
   The deal also contains a standstill agreement under which
Coniston is barred from buying significant numbers of Gillette
shares, participating in any proxy contest or otherwise seeking
control of the company for three years.
   The settlement ends Coniston's suit over the April 21 proxy vote
it lost to Gillette. As a result, the personal care products giant
does not face a rerun of the election.
   A federal judge said last month he was inclined to order a new
vote _ which many observers thought would favor Coniston _ because
Gillette misled stockholders in an advertisement about Coniston
before the election.
   Under terms of the settlement, all Gillette stockholders may
sell one share back to the company at $45 for each seven they own.
   Gillette officials estimated that 16 million of the company's
112 million outstanding shares likely would be purchased under the
settlement.
   Gillette has relied on standstill agreements and stock buybacks
in the past to fend off unwanted suitors.
   After Revlon Group's failed bid for Gillette in 1986, Gillette
paid $558 million to buy back 9.2 million shares of stock and got
Revlon chairman Ronald O. Perelman to make a similar standstill
agreement.
   In addition, Gillette has reached a series of other standstill
agreements with potential suitors since then. The company's failure
to disclose the agreements during its proxy fight with Coniston was
another issue in its legal dispute with the partnership.
   Edward Froelich, an analyst with Pershing & Co., said Monday
that the latest settlement means Gillette management ``wants to
keep the status quo. But they're shrinking the capital and diluting
earnings a bit.''
   Froelich said the company would be able to continue fighting off
such overtures ``as long as they keep the earnings rising, and they
have. I don't think the stockholders will be too badly off.''
   Gillette stock fell $2.62{ a share to $37.50 in composite
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Coniston, which owns nearly 6 percent of Gillette's outstanding
shares, waged the proxy battle earlier this year in an effort to
win four directors seats and pressure the 12-member Gillette board
to sell the company. Coniston believes a sale would boost the value
of Gillette stock.
   Gillette filed suit April 14 to block Coniston's proxy bid on
the grounds that Coniston falsified Securities and Exchange
Commission filings and did not fully disclose all its investors.
   Coniston countersued, alleging Gillette misrepresented the
partnership in advertisements and mailings to the company's 27,000
shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all companies that had
expressed interest in buying Gillette.
   U.S. District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf ruled in early April that
Gillette inaccurately portrayed Coniston in newspaper
advertisements leading up to the proxy vote in which shareholders
rejected Coniston's slate of four director candidates.
   Paul Tierney Jr., a Coniston general partner, issued a statement
Monday saying: ``We believe this settlement at this time is in the
best interests of all concerned.''
   Joan Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for Gillette, maintained that
``all shareholders will benefit'' from the repurchase agreement and
said it was similar to the stock buy-back plan the company began in
1986, prior to Coniston's action.

   Butcher & Singer's merger with Wheat, First
Securities of Richmond, Va., will create a financial services
company with brokers in 92 locations from Massachusetts to South
Carolina, officials of the regional brokerage firms say.
   ``I think that everyone is enthusiastic about it because it
makes you much more of a contender when you're this size,'' McBee
Butcher, chairman and chief executive of Butcher & Singer, said of
Monday's merger announcement.
   Complete financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   The two firms plan to form WBF Securities Inc., a financial
services and investment banking holding company with two separate
divisions and capital of $56 million, about $15 million of which
will be contributed by Butcher & Singer.
   WBF Securities will be owned by WFS Financial, the
Richmond-based parent of Wheat, First Securities.
   WBF Securities will have about 2,000 employees, including 750
investment brokers. Butcher & Singer has 38 offices from
Massachusetts to Maryland. Wheat, First Securities, established in
1934, has 54 offices from South Carolina to Pennsylvania.
   Butcher, whose privately-held firm has roots dating to the
American Revolution, said the merger will help cut costs and raise
efficiency at Butcher & Singer. He said about 100 of the company's
500 jobs in Philadelphia will be eliminated by the merger.
   Both companies will maintain separate brokerage offices, and all
will remain open, the two parties said. The WBF Securities
headquarters will be in Richmond.
   John L. McElroy Jr., chairman and chief executive of Wheat,
First Securities, will hold the same titles with WBF Securities.
Butcher and other executives from Butcher & Singer will become
officers of WFS Financial.
   Wheat interests will own a majority in the combined companies.
Butcher said Johannes Fuerst von Thurn und Taxis, a West German
prince who last December bought one-third interest in Butcher &
Singer, will be a minority owner in WFS.
   Both parties would like to complete the merger by the end of
September, Butcher said.

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Files For Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First RepublicBank Corp., whose subsidiary banks
have been declared insolvent by federal regulators, has filed for
protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy laws.
   Federal banking authorities closed the holding company's 40
Texas banks after the close of business Friday and turned them over
to Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB Corp.
   Following that action, First RepublicBank Corp. and IFRB Corp.
its wholly owned subsidiary and intermediate holding company formed
in last year's merger with InterFirst Corp., on Saturday each filed
a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 court protection from creditors.
   First RepublicBank Corp. was left with a single bank in Delaware
and certain subsidiaries engaged in non-banking activities,
according to a prepared release issued Monday.
   ``The bankruptcy filings by the holding companies do not affect
their former banking operations in Texas,'' the statement said.
``First Republic understands that such banking locations will open
for business today as banking offices of a newly chartered bank
named NCNB Texas National Bank.''
   Formerly Texas' largest bank holding company, First RepublicBank
Corp. was declared insolvent by the U.S. comptroller of the
currency. Furthermore, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
loaned First Republic $1 billion in March, called for repayment of
its note.
   When the flagship bank could not meet the obligation,
authorities took over the bank and its subsidiaries across the
state and the FDIC awarded them to NCNB.
   The petitions, filed in a U.S. bankruptcy court for the Northern
District of Texas, listed estimated assets of $535.7 million and
liabilities of $788.2 million for First RepublicBank.
   IFRB Corp. had estimated assets of $279.2 million and
liabilities of $638.9 million, papers filed with the court said.
   FirstRepublic Bank officials said estimated assets reflected in
the petitions ``may ultimately prove worthless, including certain
intercompany accounts and sums receivable from former subsidiary
banks.''
   Liabilities of the holding companies exclude liability to the
FDIC for repayment of its $1 billion loan to some subsidiary banks
before closure.
   Other First RepublicBank subsidiaries _ First RepublicBank
Delaware, Republic Money Orders Inc. and First RepublicBank
Services Corp. _ will continue in business and serve customers
without interruption, the statement said.

   The dollar steadied at lower levels against most
major foreign currencies in thin late-morning trading in Europe
today.
   Traders said the dollar was showing little movement ahead of the
release of U.S. leading indicators for June.
   Gold prices fell.
   Traders said some dollar buying emerged in the mid-morning after
the dollar slid to a European low of 1.8575 West German marks.
   ``The dollar's fall this morning wasn't really justified, but
then again its recent rise has also been exaggerated,'' said one
trader in Milan.
   She said the markets were waiting for the release of the U.S.
leading indicators. The markets were expecting the June index to
rise between 1.1 percent and 1.5 percent, following a 0.1 percent
fall in May.
   However, she said the market probably already discounted a
better figure for June so that there would be little substantial
improvement in the dollar even if a good figure emerged.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7190, stronger
than $1.7130 Monday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8665 West German marks, down from 1.8758; 1.5555
Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 6.2963 French francs, down from
6.3255; 2.1061 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145; 1,377.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,381.50; 1.2095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2075.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.85 yen to a closing 132.40 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 132.65 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $435.25 a troy ounce, up
from late Monday's $433.75. But at mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of
$432.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $434.25, down from $436.50 late
Friday. Zurich was closed Monday for a Swiss national holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.56 to close at a bid $436.37.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.80 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $6.81.

points, or 0.14 percent, closing at 28,366.33.
   After opening lower, share prices rebounded on late buying
concentrated in heavy electrical and construction issues, dealers
said.
   The blue chip stocks and large-capital steel and heavy
industrial issues, which have led the market for some months,
faltered and left the market adrift in the morning session, they
added.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 448 to 418, with 179
others unchanged.
   On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the dollar opened at 132.65 yen
and ranged between 132.30 yen and 132.70 yen before closing at
132.40 yen, down 0.85 yen from Monday's close.
   Foreign exchange dealers said market participants did not expect
much market-moving news until Friday, when U.S. employment figures
are to be released.
   Spot trading totaled $4.253 billion, up from Monday's $3.664
billion.

<HEAD>C&NW Officials: Strike ``Inevitable''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by railroad workers against Chicago &
North Western Transportation Co. cannot be avoided, and an extended
cooling-off period would only ``prolong the inevitable,'' a company
official says.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., planned to introduce legislation today
to extend a cooling-off period in the labor dispute for 36 days,
hoping to avert a strike Thursday that would disrupt rail service
to 41,000 Chicago-area commuters and stall Midwest freight.
   But an official of CNW Corp., the railroad's parent firm, said
late Monday night such a move would be fruitless since the United
Transportation Union had rejected the company's latest compromise
offer.
   ``All it would do is prolong the inevitable,'' said James Foote,
assistant vice president of communications for the Chicago-based
company. ``Eventually there's going to have to be a strike over
this issue. There appears to be no way around it.''
   The union's general chairman, Donald Markgraf, did not return a
telephone message left at his home Monday night seeking a response
to Foote's comments.
   The dispute revolves around the railroad's plans to save $51
million a year by cutting the size of most train crews from four to
two people. The company wants to eliminate what it considers
unnecessary brakemen's jobs, leaving an engineer and conductor on
board _ a move the union vigorously opposes.
   ``These work rules date back to the steam engine era,'' Foote
said. ``We've compromised and compromised and compromised, but the
union has remained steadfast on this issue.''
   In its latest proposal, the railroad offered Monday to accept a
recommendation by a presidential emergency board and eliminate 700
brakemen's jobs instead of the 1,150 cuts it has been planning to
make.
   But union general counsel Robert Hart said such a compromise was
unacceptable and would not settle the dispute as the 12:01 a.m.
Thursday strike deadline loomed.
   In Washington, Simon spokesman David Carle said the Illinois
senator would propose an extension of the cooling-off period
imposed by President Reagan to give both sides ``breathing room''
to come up with a solution.
   Foote said, however, he did not see any reason for such a step
because more than two years of negotiations with the union have
failed to solve the dispute.
   The presidential emergency board, appointed by Reagan to resolve
the dispute, recommended in July that all the railroad's freight
trains be operated with three brakemen instead of four, and that
only two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains, Foote
said.
   The railroad initially rejected that proposal, but said Monday
it would accept it in hopes of averting a walk-out.
   A strike would affect commuters in a six-county area around
Chicago for whom C&NW provides service through an agreement with
Metra, a suburban commuter rail service.
   It also could affect freight service in several Midwestern
states. But Foote said C&NW had trained management personnel to
perform the unionized jobs and planned to operate its freight
service _ constituting 95 percent of its business _ throughout any
strike.
   Foote said the railroad would not resume commuter service
because of the potential for vandalism or other problems during a
strike.
   ``We're prepared to operate our freight lines for however long
it takes,'' Foote said. ``As long as we're under a strike
situation, we will not operate our commuter rail lines because
every day that goes by the union will become more desperate.''
   Metra Chairman Jeff Ladd said Monday both sides ``are acting
with callous disregard to the public'' by failing to settle the
dispute.
   Ladd and Samuel Skinner, chairman of the Regional Transportation
Authority that oversees Chicago-area commuter rail service, urged
both sides to resume negotiations because a strike would cause
chaos throughout the suburbs.
   C&NW's freight operations run on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000
employees in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   C&NW ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in revenue, generating
$893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight.

   Massachusetts Computer Corp. has agreed to buy the
larger Concurrent Computer Corp. for $230 million, the two
minicomputer makers have announced.
   Although Westford, Mass.-based Masscomp is the purchaser, the
resulting company will be named Concurrent Computer Corp., and
James K. Sims, president and chief executive officer of Concurrent,
will become chairman, president and chief executive of the merged
company.
   The deal, announced Monday, is expected to be completed late
next month. It will create a company with about 3,600 employees and
annual sales of about $350 million.
   Both companies make computers used in flight simulators, lottery
systems and manufacturing systems. They compete with such companies
as Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   About 180 employees at Masscomp's manufacturing plant in
Westford, Mass., are to be laid off. That plant will be closed by
Jan. 1, and the work transferred to Concurrent plants in New Jersey
and Ireland.
   Masscomp now employs 660, and Concurrent 2,800.
   Concurrent, based in Tinton Falls, N.J., had sales of $247.7
million last year. Masscomp had revenue of $74.6 million in its
1987 fiscal year.
   The merger calls for Masscomp to buy all of Concurrent's 11.5
million shares for $20 a share, a total of $230 million.
   Perkin-Elmer Corp. now owns 82 percent of Concurrent, and the
Masscomp purchase will free the merged company of outside ownership.
   Masscomp also is to assume $150 million to $170 million of
Concurrent's debt.
   Russell E. Planitzer, Masscomp president and chief executive,
will become a board member.

Holding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate developer Donald Trump has acquired
400,000 shares of Pillsbury Co. as an investment and is seeking
federal approval to buy nearly 25 percent of the ailing food giant,
according to news reports.
   Trump's new holding represents 0.4 percent of Pillsbury's
outstanding shares, according to today's editions of the New York
Times. The newspaper quoted the New York-based developer as saying
he paid $15 million for the stake, which he acquired over the last
week.
   The 0.4 percent stake is the maximum Trump was able to buy under
government antitrust regulations.
   Pillsbury has been the subject of lively takeover speculation
recently. Last week, the Minneapolis-based company named Philip L.
Smith, the head of rival General Foods Corp., as its new chairman.
But some analysts were skeptical that Smith would be able to turn
around Pillsbury, especially its Burger King fast-food chain.
   Trump often has acquired large blocks of stock in companies that
later became targets of hostile takeovers, including Gillette Co.
and Federated Department Stores Inc. He is estimated to have netted
$100 million on his investment in Federated, which he made two
weeks before Canadian retailer Campeau Corp. launched a hostile,
and ultimately successful, bid for the company.
   The Times said Trump declined to discuss his plans for the
Pillsbury stock but is not expected to try to take over the
company. ``I think it's got potential,'' he told the paper.
   Trump told the Times he had sent a letter to Pillsbury
management Monday informing the company of his acquisition and
plans to buy more.
   Pillsbury's brands include Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs
ice cream and Van de Kamp's frozen fish.

   South Korea's four major automobile

to 3.42 million vehicles by 1993, government and industry officials
said Tuesday.
   Officials at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, quoting
investment proposals by the four companies, said a sharp increase

   Industry officials said the projects would cost more than $4
billion over the next five years.
   South Korea is pushing to develop its car industry as a major
export earner. South Korean firms plan to produce 1.3 million cars
this year, about two-thirds of them set aside for exports to the
United States and other countries.
   Industry officials said Hyundai Motor Co., the country's largest
car maker, plans to build a new plant with an initial production
capacity of 360,000 vehicles by 1993 on the west coast.
   The new plant will increase Hyundai's capacity to 1.1 million
vehicles, they said.
   Daewoo Motor Co., South Korea's No. 2 automaker, also plans to
triple its capacity from the present 445,000 to 1.45 million
vehicles by 1993, the officials said.
   The expansion, if pushed successfully, would make Daewoo, a
50-50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. of the United States,
the largest car maker in South Korea, replacing Hyundai, the
officials said.
   Kia Motor Co., the No. 3 manufacturer, is currently building a
new plant capable of producing 150,000 cars in 1989 and 300,000
cars in 1991, they said. The expansion will boost Kia's total
capacity to 650,000.
   Ssangyong Motor Co., which specializes in ``Korando'' jeeps,
plans to enter the passenger car market by 1993 under a possible
technical tieup with Renault of France, the officials said.
   Ssangyong Motor, owned by the Ssangyong group, one of the
largest conglomerates in South Korea, plans to produce 200,000 cars
by 1993 and increase the capacity to 400,000 by 1997, they said.
   Most of the production would be exported, they said.

<HEAD>Major Rustproofing Company Stops Its Warranty Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rusty Jones Inc. says it is scrapping warranties
on the company's car rustproofing products because of competition
from automakers _ a move its rivals predicted could put the firm
out of business.
   Mark Drinan, a vice president of Chicago-based Rusty Jones, said
Monday the company would not issue warranties on cars sold or
treated with rustproofing Aug. 1 or later. The company also
announced it was completely suspending sales in New York because
that state requires warranties on all rustproofing products.
   Drinan acknowledged that ending warranties might force Rusty
Jones out of business altogether because consumers may be unwilling
to buy the product without a warranty.
   Drinan said the company was withdrawing its warranties because
of increased competition since the nation's major automakers
introduced in early 1987 limited, six- or seven-year warranties
against holes caused by rust.
   ``I'm not really excited about the prospects for Rusty Jones
now,'' said William Pochiluk, president of AutoFacts Inc., of
Paoli, Pa., an automotive research and consulting firm.
   ``If I were a dealer, I think I'd have a hard time giving Rusty
Jones away without a warranty, much less trying to sell it,''
Pochiluk said. ``There's going to have to be massive price slashing
to sell the product. The extended rustproof warranties from Detroit
certainly had an effect on Rusty Jones' decision.''
   Officials of Rusty Jones and Beatrice Co., which acquired the
rustproofer in 1984, would make no predictions on the future.
   Asked if the decision to drop the warranties meant Rusty Jones
would go out of business, Michael Mater, president of the Beatrice
subsidiary, said, ``Reviews are taking place, things are being
looked at. I hope it's not the end.''
   Drinan refused to say how much Rusty Jones' sales have decreased
since the automakers started their warranty program.
   He refused to provide the company's 1987 earnings or revenues.
Drinan also would not say how many outlets Rusty Jones has across
the country, although he said its operations were concentrated east
of the Mississippi River and north of the Mason-Dixon line.
   Rusty Jones' warranties covered holes in the auto's body caused
by rust. The length of the warranties varied from several years to
the life of the vehicle, depending on conditions, Drinan said.
   Under a warranty, a customer had the option of receiving the
cost of the repairs or a full refund for Rusty Jones treatment,
Drinan said.
   The automakers also now offer repairs if rust develops, Drinan
said.
   Warranties for treatments done before August 1 will still be
valid, Drinan said.

<HEAD>GCC Oil Ministers May Hold Conference in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council may meet in September to discuss the glut on the world oil
market and the stability of oil prices, the Kuwait news agency
reported.
   Citing unidentified sources, KUNA said Tuesday that the GCC
secretariat is consulting with the oil ministers of the six nations
to finalize an exact date for the meeting at the organization's
headquarters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   The GCC is comprised of four members of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates _ along with Bahrain and
Oman.
   The sources said the ministers were keen to find a way to drive
oil prices up to the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel. A barrel is
equivalent to 42 gallons.
   KUNA's sources said the GCC ministers were expected to appeal to
the OPEC member states to adhere until the end of the year to the
individual production quotas to absorb the surplus on the world
market and thereby bolster oil prices.
   Oil prices have been running about $3 a barrel below the OPEC
benchmark.
   The sources expect the GCC ministers to warn OPEC that further
increases in oil production ``could push oil prices to further
deterioration if the member states do not adhere to the official
decisions agreed upon.''
   The GCC meeting will await the outcome of the meeting of OPEC's
five-member price-monitoring committee this week, KUNA said. The
committee, comprised of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Algeria, Indonesia and Nigeria, is scheduled to begin
talks Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   The price-monitoring committee is meeting against the background
of a possible end to the 8-year-old war between Iraq and Iran, both
members of OPEC.
   The conflict had been casting shadows on the cartel, with Iraq
currently producing almost double its assigned oil quota and
insisting on having the same quota as Iran. The Iranians have been
widely accused of discounting oil because of the costs of the war.

<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s profit more
than doubled in its fiscal fourth quarter as its full-year revenue
passed the billion-dollar mark, the company sais.
   Sun reached $1 billion in annual revenue in six years, getting
to the mark about a year sooner than Apple Computer Inc. did and
coming close to the five-year record of Houston-based Compaq
Computer Corp.
   The company reported fourth-quarter net income that more than
doubled to $25.3 million or 66 cents a share from $10.9 million or
31 cents a share in the year earlier period.
   Revenues increased 96 percent to $365.1 million from $185.9
million.
   For the year, net income was up 83 percent to $66.4 million, or
$1.79 a share, from $36.3 million, or $1.11 a share. Revenue rose
to $1.05 billion from $537.5 million, a 96 percent increase.
   Scott McNealy, the president and chief executive, warned that
sales increases in the first quarter are likely to be only modest
when compared with the period that ended in June.
   He said the company made a big effort to increase shipments and
reduce its backlog in the fourth quarter.

   The stock market advanced early today, mirroring
a rally in the credit market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.83 to 2,138.34 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 620 issues up, 342
down and 445 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 35.48 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said equities were supported by bond prices, which rose
in reaction to the Commerce Department's monthly report on the
Index of Leading Indicators.
   While the government's chief forecasting gauge of future
economic activity shot up 1.4 percent in June, the biggest increase
in 18 months, investors were more interested in a downward revision
in the May index.
   The May decrease, originally estimated at 0.1 percent, was
revised to a 0.8 percent decrease, which worked to depress fears
that the economy is overheating and that interest rates inevitably
must rise.
   Analysts said the June figure mostly was in line with
expectations.
   The market's early advanced marks the fourth consecutive session
of gains in the Dow average. Still, analysts note that the gains
were posted in thin volume and were restricted to certain issues,
and they therefore remain reluctant to proclaim the stock market's
summer rally back on track.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up \ at 126{,
Boeing was up ] at 62}, Gillette was off | at 36~, and Tenneco was

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.50 to 154.02. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 306.52, up 0.19.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.78 to 2,130.51.
   Gaining issues outnumbered declines by about 11 to 9 on the

today.
   Dow has bought more than 20 million shares through nine
repurchase programs since August 1983. The most recent was in May.
   Enrique C. Falla, financial vice president of Dow, said because
it is currently undervalued and because Dow predicts continuing

   Dow stock was up 25 cents to $88 a share in early New York Stock

<HEAD>Utility Rates Hiked 30 Percent; More Economic Changes On The Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has increased
utility rates by 30 percent as part of its efforts to narrow the
budget deficit and bring triple-digit inflation under control.
   Presidential spokesman Jose Lopez, who announced the increase
late Monday night, said wage and price controls, which were
introduced in 1985 and abandoned last year, were not being
considered.
   More elements of the government's plan, which may include
devaluation, were expected to be disclosed later today.
   Banks and exchange houses remained closed for a second day. Vice
President Victor Martinez, dismissing speculation to the contrary,
said they will reopen as scheduled on Wednesday.
   Financial institutions have been jittery for weeks about the
impending changes. They were ordered closed by the government on
Sunday. Last week, they refused to sell certificates of deposit for
longer than seven days. The interest rate was 19 percent.
   The opposition Peronist Party and the 3-million member General
Labor Confederation complained Monday that they were not consulted
about the changes.
   The agriculture sector, which produces the soy and wheat and
cattle that generate most of Argentina's foreign exchange, bitterly
opposed exchange restrictions that would limit their profits.
   The government reportedly is considering requiring farmers and
ranchers to turn in their dollars at commercial rates that are
lower than the financial exchange rates.
   President Raul Alfonsin spent most of Monday closeted at his
official residence in the suburb Olivos with top advisers.
   Central Bank President Jose Machinea and Treasury Secretary
Mario Brodersohn returned Sunday from Washington, where they
reportedly negotiated a $1.2 billion stand-by loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
   Alfonsin, who took office in December 1983, has been plagued by
economic problems, principally a foreign debt of $53 billion, and
an inflation rate that has risen by 121.2 percent during the past
six months, and by 321.7 percent over the past year.

   Braniff Inc.'s short-lived expansion in
Orlando has come to a halt with plans to cut service by 30 percent
and eliminate 154 jobs.
   Braniff, announcing the cutbacks Monday, called them seasonal
and temporary. The airline has opened a new hub in Kansas City,
Mo., and is concentrating much of its attention there in the wake
of Eastern Airlines' recent pullout from Kansas City.
   Dallas-based Braniff returned to Orlando in January and expanded
rapidly when it acquired Florida Express Inc., a regional carrier.
Braniff had pulled out of Orlando in 1982.
   Braniff, recently acquired by investment group BIA-COR Holdings
Inc. for $100 million, employs about 600 people in Orlando. The
cutbacks take effect next month.
   ``We're trying to build some hubs that will have good sustaining
power,'' Braniff spokesman Don McGuire said. ``September is not the
time to build a hub in Orlando.''

<HEAD>George Russell: Tacoma's Close Enough To Wall Street, Thanks</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A half century ago, the Russell clan left
Wall Street for the much quieter avenues of Tacoma. Today, even
though he keeps a minute-by-minute watch on New York markets,
George Russell has no desire to trade his view of Puget Sound for
Manhattan.
   Russell runs the Frank Russell Group of Companies _ named for
his grandfather _ which advises pension funds and other large pools
of capital on how to make the most money with the least risk.
   Clients include 40 of the largest U.S. corporations _ among
them, International Business Machines Corp., General Motors Corp.,
Boeing Co., Hearst Corp. and Xerox Corp. _ plus a growing number of
foreign companies, foundations, profit-sharing plans and a few very
rich individuals.
   In all, Russell clients have holdings totaling about $240
billion.
   The 56-year-old Russell pioneered the idea of tracking
performance of money managers so pension funds can rely on more
than just intuition in deciding where to entrust their assets.
   The privately held company now employs about 700 people, and has
annual revenues ``in the neighborhood of $100 million,'' Russell
says.
   He's proud of a new home office due to open in downtown Tacoma
this fall: A telescope in his current headquarters lets visitors
monitor the new building's progress. Moreover, he's proud the
company's been able to make it in Tacoma, a city that suits his
style.
   ``I had a chance to go to Wall Street, and didn't choose to get
into that herd-type thought-process,'' he said.
   ``If you're on Wall Street, what you've got is a beeper on your
belt, and if you don't answer that beeper 24 hours a day, you're
not going to get your bonus at the end of the year.
   ``We look at it quite differently, and maybe it's because we're
in Tacoma. I don't know, but it seems to me that we ought to have
the family beeper on the belt and if the family yells for help then
the person ought to go solve that problem and then come do the
business work.''
   In his line of work, things ``will never improve unless the
people that are in charge hire people that are smarter than they
are,'' Russell said.
   ``If you get the priorities in the right place to begin with as
you run a business and you put the people ahead of the business,
then they'll eventually realize they can have fun in life, too, and
the business will be fun, too.''
   Russell's office reflects his work-hard-but-have-fun beliefs.
Folding doors screen off a narrow, wall-length work area from the
rest of the room, which is filled with comfy furniture and
photographs of his family, the Northwest and his 60-foot yacht.
   The boat, he says, has entertained a lot of clients. ``If you
come to New York, you go out to a fine restauraunt. In Tacoma, your
options are different.''
   Russell defines his outfit as ``asset management consultants,''
three words that take him about 30 minutes to explain. ``This is
not an easy organization to understand,'' he conceded.
   Besides advising the 40 corporate pension accounts, the company
gathers and sells statistics on money managers, runs mutual funds
for bank trust departments, operates a brokerage house, and offers
investment funds and advice for smaller clients, including
endowments, foundations and individuals.
   It also has developed indexes for measuring stock and real
estate performance, including the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000
indexes traded on the New York Futures Exchange.
   ``If you think of a compass, we pretty much on the consulting
side are covering 360 degrees,'' Russell said.
   Doing so has brought his privately held company 25 percent
growth in each of the past 15 years, he says.
   ``The staff he's put together has been helpful to us in deciding
what we want to do in making investment decisions,'' said Al
Wolfarth, assistant treasurer for pensions at Monsanto Corp., which
has used Russell since 1974. In a field with many good companies,
Wolfarth said, ``I would refer to the Russell firm as the Cadillac
of the industry.''
   Russell's grandfather, Frank, started the company in 1936 when
he retired as a Merrill Lynch broker to come to Tacoma where his
son was a newspaper executive. He kept busy as an investment
counselor and by running a small mutual fund.
   ``All his friends were in it _ there were about 176 stockholders
and $300,000 in assets,'' George Russell said.
   Russell joined his grandfather when he graduated from Harvard
University in 1958. He took over the firm two months later when his
grandfather died.
   It prospered, with about 300 salesmen by 1965, selling mutual
funds, life insurance and real estate syndication. But, ``the fact
was that I didn't feel that we were adding any particular value,''
Russell said. ``There were a lot of people doing what we were
doing.''
   About 1968, he says, he began looking at pension accounts, which
then were usually in conservative investments and managed by one
person, ``generally selected for some political reason.'' A few
years earlier, researcher Peter Dietz, later hired by Russell, had
come up with a set of formulas for tracking pension fund
performance.
   In 1969, Russell made a cold telephone call to J.C. Penney Co.,
and sold the treasurer on a service to provide information on where
to put Penney's pension money. Penney was the first client in
Russell's core consulting company, which he limits to 40 clients.
   More cold calls and word-of-mouth advertising helped the company
grow. In 1979, Russell opened a London office and later added
offices in Sydney, Tokyo and Toronto. Each foreign office also
limits its list of clients, which include Rolls Royce and the
largest banks in Australia and Japan.
   By limiting clients, Russell says, they get better service and
he gets a stable business. In the last 19 years, there have been
only 10 changes in the list , he says.
   ``After this long time, we're quite happy,'' said client
Wolfarth. ``Don't tell George that because we try to keep them on
edge once in a while.''

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Futures Open Sharply Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn and soybean futures opened sharply
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade as crops continued to
bake in the heat wave gripping the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
Wheat opened slightly lower.
   Demand for soybean futures was especially strong following the
Agriculture Department's weekly crop progress survey, which found
soybean plants blooming on 76 percent of the soybean acreage in the
top 19 producing states.
   ``You're looking at most of the beans in the most critical stage
of yield determination, the pod-setting and pod-filling stage,''
said Cathy Leow, a grain market analyst in New York with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. ``Given that, and given the adverse
weather, the bean market is showing strength.''
   But she said fears of severe yield reductions were tempered by
the National Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day outlook, which
predicted normal rainfall and above-average temperatures in the
Midwest and the Northern Plains during the first five days of next
week.
   Wheat opened slightly lower, partly in reaction to the USDA's
rejection of China's bid for 600,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S.
wheat, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3\ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.77 a bushel; corn was 5{
cents lower to 13 cents higher with September at $3.03 a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 9{ cents higher with September at $2.92 a
bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 31{ cents higher with August at
$8.46 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .30 cent higher with August
at 65.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .55 cent
lower with August at 78 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to
.93 cent higher with August at 45.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .30 cent lower to .38 cent higher with August at 32.75
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled sharply lower on Monday while pork
futures were sharply higher.

   President Reagan said today he will
reluctantly allow a plant-closing bill that he called ``bad
legislation'' to become law without his signature.
   While Reagan called the bill requiring companies to give 60 days
advance notice of plant closing, or layoffs of 50 or more workers,
a dangerous step ``down a road of European labor policy,'' he
acknowledged the ``political realities'' of public support for the
measure.
   ``In the national interest and to end these political
shenanigans and get on with the business of the nation ... I have
decided to allow the plant closing bill to become law, but without
my signature,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the bill had become
a ``political football'' that was being used by Democrats ``more
interested in scoring political points with organized labor'' to
hold up trade legislation.
   ``Sometimes you have to take a touchback in order to get better
field position,'' Fitzwater said. ``The political show that the
Democrats have put on over this bill is evident to everyone.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called Reagan's decision ``a
victory for communities across the country, a victory for America's
competitive position in the world and a victory for common sense in
the federal budget.''
   Senate Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia
congratulated Reagan on what he called a good law ``for the
American working people.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said after meeting
with Reagan earlier today that the president's intention in not
exercising a veto was to prod Congress into action on other
legislation, rather than to take some heat off likely Republican
presidential candidate George Bush.
   Dole said Reagan is ``swallowing something that he doesn't
totally like in order to get us off the dime'' on separate
legislation overhauling the U.S. trade laws.
   The senator noted that there are only 25 to 28 legislative days
remaining in this session, and that several crucial issues remain,
including new assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels and drought
assistance to farmers.
   Assistant Republican leader Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said
there are no more than 23 votes in the Senate for upholding a veto,
saying ``the reality is it's a very difficult exercise to get 34,''
the number of votes necessary.
   Dole said that Reagan ``very much wants'' a trade bill passed
during this session and said the president is ``willing to swallow
a little bit, even though he doesn't like it.''
   Both Dole and Simpson have been mentioned as possible vice
presidential running mates with Bush. Both said they did not think
politics played any role in Reagan's indication that he intends to
let the bill become law.
   ``I haven't lost a bit of sleep thinking about that,'' Simpson
said.
   House Republican Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi said that while
there might be a chance in the House to sustain a Reagan veto of
the plant-closing bill, ``it would be very difficult.''
   ``The battle is over and we ought to move on to the next
issue,'' Lott said. He said that congressional Democrats would
merely attach the same plant-closing provision to subsequent
legislation _ if a veto were upheld _ and said that lawmakers
should not ``play with this cat'' any longer.

   The stock market headed lower today after an
early advance as fresh economic data gave traders reasons to fear
the economy may be overheating.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.11 to 2,123.40 at
midday.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 544 issues up, 732
down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 92.70 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street.
   The market advanced sharply on the opening and then gradually
gave back the gains in listless dealings.
   Analysts said equities initially were supported by bond prices,
which rose in reaction to the Commerce Department's monthly report
on the Index of Leading Indicators.
   While the government's chief forecasting gauge of future
economic activity shot up 1.4 percent in June, the biggest increase
in 18 months but in line with expectations, it was partially offset
by a downward revision in the May index.
   The May decrease, originally estimated at 0.1 percent, was
revised to a 0.8 percent decrease.
   Separately, the government said factory orders rose 5.5 percent
in June, far above market expecations of a 3.5 percent increase.
   ``Stocks are responding to the fact that the economy is in the
late stages of the business cycle, which will precipitate action by
the Federal Reserve'' to raise interest rates, said Alfred Goldman,
vice president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Goldman noted that volume is light, when trading in takeover
stocks and strategies to capture quarterly dividends are subtracted.
   ``This shows a lack of conviction,'' he said. ``Market
participants are hanging on every bit of economic news, but there's
no long-term investment buying coming in.''
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Texaco was up ] at 47\.
The oil giant said it would sell its 78-percent stake in Texaco
Canada. Pillsbury was up 1] at 38[; developer Donald Trump revealed
he owns 0.4 percent of the food company and is seeking to boost

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Central Railroad saw the drought coming
and geared up to handle the mountains of grain and coal diverted to
the rails when Mississippi River levels dropped too low for barge
traffic, railroad officails say.
   While barges were stranded in shallow water, the IC _ whose
tracks have paralleled the river for 137 years _ was chugging
along, bringing grain and coal from Illinois to the South.
   In the first 26 days of July, the IC moved 9,201 carloads of
corn and soybeans from Illinois to elevators between Baton Rouge,
La. and New Orleans _ 4,815 more carloads than in the same period
last year, the Chicago Tribune reported in today's editions.
   In the same period, coal shipments totaled 12,972 cars, an
increase of 4,361 loads, and chemical carloads were up 8,500 from a
year earlier, the Tribune reported.
   The report quoted railroad officials as saying that last spring,
before the impact of the drought was felt in the Midwest, Illinois
Central hired consultants to study water levels in the Mississippi.
   When the consultants concluded 1988 would be an extremely
difficult year for barge operators who depend on deep water to move
their towboats, the railroad began stockpiling rail cars and other
equipment, officials said.
   The preparations paid off.
   ``We've never made a profit in July since 1851,'' said Harry J.
Bruce, chairman and chief executive officer of the railroad.
   This year the carrier went beyond the ``break-even'' point,
Bruce said, though he would not indicate the exact profit.
   The railroad's consultants have said the low river levels will
last into the winter, causing ice jams to form earlier than usual,
Bruce said.
   This also will mean more business for the railroad, he said.
   ``The new business isn't the result of an aberration that just
happened since Easter,'' Bruce said.
   ``The situation has been coming on for about 10 years with the
declining water levels.''
   He said he hopes the recent traffic surge provides an
opportunity for the railroad to demonstrate to shippers that it can
handle their commodities regularly, not just when barges are
stranded.
   ``I don't want to be their fire department,'' Bruce said.

<TEXT>
   The government said today its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity shot up 1.4 percent
in June, the biggest increase in 18 months.
   The big advance in the Commerce Department's Index of Leading
Indicators provided fresh evidence that the current recovery, which
has already lasted a peacetime record of 69 months, is in no danger
of collapsing.
   In other economic news, the government reported today that
orders to U.S. factories surged 5.5 percent in June to a record
$229.8 billion. It was the biggest monthly increase in 17 years and
was credited to the sharpest rise in military demand since December
1982.
   In a third report, the government said that sales of new
single-family homes shot up 8.4 percent in June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 734,000 units, the fastest sales pace since
February 1987.
   Analysts said the string of reports, while reflecting a strong
pace of business activity, also increased fears that the economy
was overheating with higher inflation pressures likely in coming
months.
   Those fears were evident in the stock market today, where prices
headed lower after an early advance. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials was off 7.11 at 2,123.40 at noontime and falling issues
outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   But in the credit markets, bond traders shrugged off the
inflation worries, took their cue from a rising dollar and pushed
prices higher at midday. The Treasury's closely watched 30-year
bond was up about $6.25 for every $1,000 in face value, while its
yield fell to 9.09 percent from 9.15 percent late Monday.
   Analysts said the increase in the leading index was in large
part a rebound from May, when the index had dropped a sharp 0.8
percent.
   The June advance was the biggest one-month gain since the index
rose by 2.2 percent in December 1986. It was the latest in a string
of reports reflecting better-than-expected economic growth this
year.
   The government said last week that the economy, as measured by
the gross national product, expanded at a 3.1 percent annual rate
from April through June. This robust growth helped to push the
unemployment rate down to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June.
   This performance was a far cry from the recession that many
analysts were predicting in the wake of last October's stock market
crash.
   In June, the strength in the leading index was widespread, with
seven of the available nine components registering advances.
   The biggest source of strength came from a 5.7 percent rise in
stock prices in June. The increase in the Standard & Poor's index
of 500 stocks was followed by a slowdown in business deliveries,
considered a sign of increasing demand; an increase in plant and
equipment orders; a drop in unemployment claims; an increase in
building permits; a change in raw materials prices and a rise in
the money supply.
   One indicator, orders for consumer goods, was a negative factor
on the index and one other indicator, the length of the average
workweek, was unchanged in June.
   The 1.4 percent rise left the overall index at 194.0 percent of
its 1967 base of 100.
   The economy has been bolstered this year by a boom in U.S.
export sales and heavy business investemnt. The GNP, the total
output of goods and services, grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent
in the first quarter and 3.1 percent in the second quarter.
   The Reagan administration, which began the year forecasting GNP
growth for all of 1988 at a lackluster 2.4 percent, is now
forecasting growth of around 3 percent, when measured from the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   This is in line with the view of many private analysts, who see
the economy slowing from the 3.3 percent average rate in the first
six months of the year.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm, said he expected the GNP would grow about
2.8 percent this year, about the same as DRI was predicting before
last October's stock market crash.
   ``We still expect the second half to be a little slower than the
first, but the first half was very good,'' he said. ``We will have
a much better year than everyone assumed right after the market
crash.''
   David Berson, chief economic forecaster at the Federal National
Mortgage Association, predicted the GNP would expand at an annual
rate of 2.6 percent from July through December.
   He said interest rates are likely to continue rising, even with
this slight slowdown in growth, as the Federal Reserve continues to
worry about inflationary pressures from tight labor markets and
high factory operating rates.
   As a consequence of further Fed credit tightening, Berson
forecast that a wide variety of interest rates would head higher as
well, with mortgage rates, now at 10.5 percent, climbing above 11.5
percent next year.

   Stock prices fell Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange in a lackluster session.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 6.7
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,855.5.
   Volume was a moderate 376.5 million shares, down from 381.7
million shares a day earlier.
   Stock prices remained locked in a narrow range throughout the
day, dealers said. The other major markets failed to provide much
impetus to London stocks.
   The majority of British blue chip stocks closed lower as the low
trading volume prompted market makers to push down prices in an
effort to generate some buying interest. A handful of shares bucked
the negative trend on dividend-related buying or special situations.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 5.1 points to 1,491.4.
The Financial Times 500-share index fell 3.1 points to close at
1,058.5.

   Alfred M. Lewis Inc., an 83-year-old

the grocery distribution business.
   The deal is set to close in about six weeks.
   Lewis has warehouses in Riverside, Los Angeles, San Diego and
Phoenix, Ariz.
   The unsolicited offer from Price was made two weeks ago, said
Lewis Chairman Carl Peterson.
   Price Co. has 38 retail warehouse stores which sell food and a

   The stock market held at lower levels today as

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 3.55 to 2,126.96 at
midafternoon.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 11 to 8 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 580 issues up, 792

   But a separate report that put the June rise in factory orders

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade while drought-stunted crops
baked in a sizzling Midwestern heat wave.
   But forecasts for scattered showers in the Corn Belt later this
week limited gains in the potentially explosive corn and soybean
markets, and wheat closed lower on disappointing export news,
analysts said.
   ``We're quite surprised that with this heat out there, the
markets aren't doing better than they did,'' said John Frazier, a
grain market specialist in Chicago with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   The closely watched soybean crop in the central Farm Belt is in
the midst of a critical pod-development and pod-filling stage that
will last about three more weeks, Frazier said. The soybeans need
cooler weather and moisture during that period to avoid severe
yield losses, he said.
   ``Our (soybean production) forecasts are dropping daily,''
Frazier said.
   Wheat prices fell partly in reaction to the USDA's rejection of
China's bid for 600,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat,
analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 6 cents lower with September
at $3.75{ a bushel; corn was 10{ cents lower to 11 cents higher
with September at $3.01 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 8{
cents higher with September at $2.90 a bushel; and soybeans were 15
cents lower to 18{ cents higher with August at $8.28 a bushel.

   The stock market struggled to finish
fractionally higher today as investors digested a host of fresh
economic data.
   The gain, however unconvincing, is the market's fourth
consecutive advance and comes on the heels of a 77-point jump in
the previous three sessions.
   The market rose sharply at the opening but continued to move in
and out of negative territory during a volatile session marked by
computer-triggered selling.
   Analysts said a strong bond market and a firm dollar helped
support equities.
   The day's first gains were felt in the credit markets, where
bond prices rose in reaction to the Commerce Department's monthly
report on the Index of Leading Indicators.
   The government's chief forecasting gauge of future economic
activity shot up 1.4 percent in June, the biggest increase in 18
months, but the gain was partially offset by a downward revision in
the May index.
   Another government report put the June rise in factory orders at
5.5 percent _ far above market expecations of a 3.5 percent
increase.
   Analysts said there was plenty of confusion over what the data
would mean in terms of interest rates.
   Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president at First Albany Corp.,
said the overriding sentiment among investors is reluctance.

<HEAD>Shareholder Group Opposes Heck's Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Heck's Inc. stockholders
said Tuesday it opposed a recently filed company reorganization
plan because it dilutes its shares.
   The plan, filed late Monday, has what was described as crucial
support of the discount retail chain's creditors' committees, said
Maarten Hemsley, Heck's chief financial officer.
   ``We're excited by having accomplished this,'' Hemsley said.
``It's has been a major hurdle.''
   But Robert Miller, an attorney for the shareholders' committee,
said his group opposes the plan and called it illegal and
unfeasible.
   ``Among other things, the plan illegally denigrates the
shareholders' rights in favor of a sweetheart deal for
management,'' Miller said Tuesday.
   Heck's filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws a year ago.
   Under the 60-page plan, Heck's would issue new stock to replace
current shares. Stockholders would receive up to 10 percent of the
new stock, while about 85 percent of the shares in the reorganized
company would go to Heck's major bank and other uninsured
creditors. The remaining 5 percent would be issued to key Heck's
employees.
   The plan also calls for major creditors to gain four seats on
the reorganized, nine-member board of directors.
   The reorganization plan must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Ronald Pearson.
   Heck's operates about 85 retail stores in West Virginia and
several surrounding states.

   The dollar rose Tuesday against most major
currencies after the government released a triple dose of strong
economic data, including a report forecasting solid growth for the
rest of the year.
   Gold prices slipped, however. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid for gold at $431.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down $3 from late Monday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar firmed after the government
reported that the Index of Leading Indicators _ its chief barometer
of future economic activity _ increased a robust 1.4 percent in
June, its sharpest gain in 18 months.
   In two other economic reports for June, the government said
sales of new homes shot up 8.4 percent and orders to U.S. factories
for manufactured goods soared 5.5 percent.
   ``The economic numbers that came out were good for the dollar,''
said George DeLuna, a vice president and trader for Irving Trust Co.
   ``They are bullish, but people are still worried about possible
central-bank intervention'' to keep the dollar from rising too
high, added Dan Holland, a trader at Discount Corp.
   DeLuna said that while traders were impressed with the reported
economic strength, they weren't too concerned about inflation
getting out of hand. He noted that the government revised downward,
to 0.8 percent from 0.1 percent, the decrease in the May leading
indicators.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 132.40 yen.
The dollar was quoted at 132.95 yen later in London. Later, in New
York, the dollar stood at 132.98 yen, up from 132.585 Monday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound, which
fell to $1.7093 from $1.7130 late Monday. The pound fell to
$1.70675 in New York from $1.7202 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.87725 West German marks, up from 1.86795;
1.5628 Swiss francs, up from 1.5546; 6.3185 French francs, up from
6.3075; 1.20595 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20825; and 1,383.25
Italian lire, up from 1,377.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday,
included: 1.8760 West German marks, up from 1.8758; 1.5635 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5615; 6.3265 French francs, up from 6.3255;
2.1140 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145; 1.2068 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2075; and 1,380.75 Italian lire, down from 1,381.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $431.50 a troy ounce, down from $434.40 Monday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $433 a troy ounce, compared
with $433.75 bid late Monday. Gold also fell to a bid of $433 an
ounce in Zurich, down from $436.50 there late Friday. The Zurich
market was closed Monday for a Swiss national holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.56 an ounce to close at
$436.37.
   Silver prices were mixed. Silver for August delivery finished at
$6.792 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, down from $6.867 on
Monday. But in London silver rose to a late bid of $6.86 a troy
ounce from Monday's $6.81.

<TEXT>
   A West German firm has agreed to
buy and modernize an 80-year-old steel mill here, possibly tripling
employment at the plant, officials announced Tuesday.
   Korf KG has agreed to buy the mill from Rhode Island Forging
Steel Inc. and make it a supplier for the Connecticut Steel Corp.'s
Wallingford, Conn., facility. Terms of the deal were not disclosed
and some Connecticut Steel shareholders were said to be involved in
the purchase.
   The mill currently employs 50 people, but that number could
triple within the next two years, Louis A. Fazzano, director of the
state Department of Economic Development, said in a news release.
   The plant currently melts down scrap steel, forming it into
semi-finished billets that are sold to rolling mills around the
world. It will become the prime supplier of billets to Connecticut
Steel's rolling mill and wire drawing plant in Wallingford, the
release said.

   The stock market finished fractionally higher
Tuesday in a volatile session that saw investors hesitate in the
face of fresh economic data.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 0.71 point to
close at 2,131.22, its fourth consecutive advance. The key
indicator gained nearly 77 points in the previous three sessions.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 issues
up, 711 down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 166.66 million shares,
up from 138.17 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
188.53 million shares.
   The market rose sharply at the opening but then faltered, moving
in and out of negative territory amid computer-triggered selling.
   Analysts said a strong bond market and a firm dollar helped
support equities. The government released fresh evidence of the
economy's strength, which the currency markets embraced as a sign
to buy dollars. The bond market, which usually sinks in the face of
strong economic signals, also moved sharply higher.
   The government said its main forecasting gauge, the Index of
Leading Indicators, shot up 1.4 percent in June, the biggest
increase in 18 months. But the gain was partially offset by a
downward revision in the May index.
   Another government report put the June rise in factory orders at
5.5 percent _ far above market expectations of a 3.5 percent
increase.
   Gene Jay Seagle, director of research at Gruntal Financial Inc.,
attributed the rise in factory orders to a cheap dollar that has
made U.S. exports more attractive. ``If that were inflationary, the
bond market wouldn't have rallied,'' he said.
   Still, analysts said there was plenty of confusion over what the
data would mean in terms of interest rates.
   Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president at First Albany Corp.,
said the overriding sentiment among investors is reluctance. ``You
get this kind of rollercoaster behavior because investors are
skeptical and cautious and digging their heels in,'' he said.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Texaco was up } at 47|.
The oil giant said it would sell its 78-percent stake in Texaco
Canada.
   Pillsbury rose 1| to 38]; developer Donald Trump revealed he
owns 0.4 percent of the food company and is seeking to boost that
stake to 15 percent.
   Elsewhere, NCNB, which has agreed to take over First
RepublicBank, jumped 2~ to 27~. Armtek was off \ at 42]. Mark IV
Industries plans to begin a tender offer for Armtek common shares
at $40 each.
   Elsewhere, IBM was down { at 125}, and Gillette was off 1 at
36{. Tenneco, the most active issue with more than 10 million
shares trading hands, fell [ to 48] as traders moved to capture the
company's dividend.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $82 million in value.
   The NYSE index was up 0.02 at 153.54.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.34 to 313.61,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was off 0.15 at 272.06.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.21
to 306.50. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 387.80, off 0.20.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday it is
easing restrictions on the export of ``lower-level'' computers and
computerized equipment to China, the Soviet Union and other Eastern
Bloc countries.
   The decision means that China will be permitted to buy computers
with double the processing speed of those it previously has been
allowed to purchase.
   By eliminating the requirement that such exports be cleared by
COCOM, the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls, license processing should be cut by 50 days, the
department said.
   ``This change is part of the United States' objectives aimed at
making the multilateral export control system stronger by focusing
controls on truly strategic equipment and reducing unnecessary
burdens imposed on industry,'' Commerce Under Secretary for Export
Administration Paul Freedenberg said in a statement.
   The new regulation also eases restrictions on the export of
personal computers to those countries.

<HEAD>Heat Wave Persists But Jittery Grain Markets Close Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop futures closed mixed Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
despite a third day of scorching heat in the Corn Belt.
   On other markets, coffee futures plunged again; cotton was
sharply lower; livestock and meat futures were mostly lower;
precious metals slipped; energy futures declined and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Corn and soybean futures settled mostly higher while wheat
finished lower in Chicago.
   But with temperatures in the Midwest again peaking near 100
degrees on Tuesday, ``we're quite surprised that with this heat out
there, the markets aren't doing better than they did,'' said John
Frazier, a grain market specialist in Chicago with Balfour Maclaine
Corp.
   Frazier said buying was limited by traders' memories of steep
losses in the soybean market during the previous two weeks and by
at least one private forecaster's prediction of widely scattered
showers in the Corn Belt during the rest of the week.
   Experts said the closely watched central Midwestern soybean crop
was in the midst of a critical pod-development and pod-filling
stage that will last about three more weeks.
   But the soybeans need cooler temperatures and more moisture to
avoid severe damage and Frazier said his company's soybean
production estimates were falling daily.
   ``As we do our crop tours, we're finding a tremendous number of
bean stalks that have very few pods if any pods at all,'' he said.
   The National Weather Service has predicted normal precipitation
and above-average temperatures for the Corn Belt during the first
five days of next week, but the market disregarded the forecast.
   ``It's difficult to make a forecast any more than four or five
days out,'' said Cathy Leow, assistant vice president in charge of
grain futures trading with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   Corn and oat futures followed the soybean market while wheat
prices fell partly in reaction to news that the Agriculture
Department had rejected China's bid for 600,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 5{ cents lower with September at
$3.75{ a bushel; corn was 10} cents lower to 11 cents higher with
September at $3.01 a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 7\ cents
higher with September at $2.88} a bushel; soybeans were 15 cents
lower to 18 cents higher with August at $8.29 a bushel.
   Coffee futures plummeted for the fifth time in the last six
sessions on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on fears that
producer and consumer nation-members of the International Coffee
Organization will be unable to come to an agreement on quotas,
analysts said.
   The September coffee contract settled 7.84 cents lower at
$1.0883 a pound, compared with $1.3295 cents a pound just one week
ago.
   Cotton futures fell to new life-of-contract lows for all
delivery months except October on the New York Cotton Exchange
after a USDA report showed the cotton crop improving, analysts said.
   October cotton settled 1.13 cents lower at 55.02 cents a pound.
   Sagging demand for beef weighed on the cattle futures market at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the bearish sentiment spilled
over into the neighboring pork pits, said Dale Durchholz, livestock
analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .28 cent to 1.33 cents lower with August at
65.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .78 cent lower
with August at 77.85 cents a pound; hogs were .57 cent lower to .35
cent higher with August at 45.32 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .37 cent to 1.90 cents lower with August at 32.15
cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices fell moderately late in the day on the New
York Mercantile Exchange on fears that Saudi Arabia will not
cooperate with other OPEC members when the cartel's pricing
committee meets Wednesday to consider measures aimed at raising
prices, said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders
Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents to 55 cents
lower with September at $15.61 a barrel; heating oil was .62 cent
to .88 cent lower with September at 44.29 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .43 cent to .73 cent lower with September at 47.86
cents a gallon.
   The drop in crude oil prices weighed on the inflation-sensitive
precious metals market, pushing gold and silver futures lower on
New York's Commodity Exchange, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.90 to $3.60 lower with August at $431.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 7.9 cents lower with September at
$6.84 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .40 point higher at 273.05.

<HEAD>SEC Reminds Contractors to Report Involvement in Pentagon Probe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Monday correct in 2nd graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
reminding defense contractors that federal securities laws require
them to reveal any involvement in the Pentagon procurement
investigation.
   The SEC, in a statement Monday, said, ``Companies are reminded
to consider their disclosure obligations in connection with issues
arising from the government's defense contract procurement
inquiry.''
   Securities laws requires companies to reveal to potential
investors any known factors that may hurt profits, including
investigations by government agencies.
   The reminder could flush out names of companies previously not
known to be part of the scandal.
   The SEC's statement said, ``The commission recognizes the exact
subjects and scope of the government's inquiry are still unknown.
... However, companies engaged in the defense business should
review on an ongoing basis the need for appropriate disclosure.''
   Companies file their financial statements with the SEC every
three months. Statements for the April-June quarter are due by the
middle of this month.
   Justice Department investigators are looking into allegations
that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former
military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   The SEC said its warning applies not only to companies that are
targets of the probe, but also to companies that would be adversely
affected by resulting changes in Defense Department procedures.

   Senate leaders pushed Tuesday for speedy floor
action on a major trade bill only hours after President Reagan
reluctantly agreed not to veto legislation requiring companies to
provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs.
   ``The president wanted a trade bill _ that's why he swallowed
the plant closings,'' said Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., as
the Senate began debate on the 1,000-page bill that is intended to
curb U.S. trade deficits.
   The Senate had been waiting to act on the trade bill, which the
House passed, 376-45, on July 13. There had been an implied threat
that the trade bill might die if Reagan balked at signing the
plant-closings bill.
   Reagan vetoed an earlier version of the trade bill, largely
because it included the plant-closing provision he opposed. That
section was removed and passed separately by veto-proof margins in
the House and Senate.
   The latest version of the trade bill would give the
administration urgently sought authority to make agreements in the
current ``Uruguay Round'' of international trade talks, and would
assure accelerated congressional approval of any such deals.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., expressed hope the
Senate would approve the House-passed trade bill without amendments
and send it quickly to the president for signing.
   Before recessing for the night, Byrd announced tentative plans
to vote on the bill Wednesday. But leaders failed to dissuade
senators from offering amendments. They had sought to do so as a
way of hastening the bill directly to Reagan's desk and avoiding
the potential quagmire of negotiations to resolve differences with
the House.
   There was still a chance of sending the bill directly to Reagan
but only if all amendments offered were defeated.
   Farm Belt senators attempting to strip from the bill or at least
weaken a provision that would increase duty-free imports of
Caribbean ethanol _ ethyl alcohol that is mixed with gasoline to
form the fuel gasahol. Ethanol is made from farm products and U.S.
corn growers are anxious to block further imports.
   Besides giving the administration authority to reach agreements
on modifying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the major
pact that regulates world commerce, the bill would streamline
mechanisms for imposing import curbs to protect U.S. industries and
retaliate against trade violations by other countries.
   Other provisions range from a potential $2 billion in
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
industry earnings.
   The bill was largely stripped of protectionist provisions that
drew fierce opposition from the administration and a broad
coalition of ``free trade'' advocates in Congress.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee
and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, told reporters he
would ``pursue a no-amendments strategy'' to keep the bill out of a
House-Senate conference.
   Asked about Reagan's about-face on the plant-closing notices,
Bentsen replied, ``I think he saw the polls, and I think he also
knew what was going to happen in the Senate.''
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said he was glad to see the
plant-closings controversy resolved.
   ``I think that this issue has been a tar baby as far as
Republicans are concerned,'' Danforth said. ``That was a political
mistake. Most people in the country did not agree with the
president's position on plant closings and he finally reached the
conclusion that this was not a winner and the time had come to get
rid of the tar baby.''

<HEAD>NL Industries Drops Proposed Merger With Valhi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NL Industries Inc. has dropped consideration of a
proposed merger with its majority shareholder Valhi Inc., the
holding company for investor Harold Simmons, after failing to reach
a merger agreement, NL said Tuesday.
   NL Industries' board of directors plans meet Aug. 12 to review
alternatives with respect to the separation of its chemicals and
petroleum services operations and the redemption of its Series C
preferred stock, the company said.
   ``Exactly what the alternatives are, we really can't say,'' said
NL spokesman Patrick M. Murray. ``We've had some very preliminary
discussions and we'll be working through that process in next two
weeks.''
   Valhi gained control of Houston-based NL, a petroleum services
and chemical company, in a hostile takeover in 1986. It owns about
52 percent of NL's outstanding common shares and 67 percent of the
Class C shares.
   Valhi has offered to acquire NL's Series C preferred stock,
which represents the chemicals unit and was issued as a takeover
defense in June 1986, while giving common shareholders cash and
stock in a new company that would own the oilfield business.
   NL's three independent directors, who retained the right to veto
merger and acquisition plans following the hostile takeover, have
blocked Valhi's attempts to acquire the chemicals business.
   ``The issue all along has been an issue of valuation and how the
stock was valued,'' said Murray. ``It was really an issue of our
independent directors approving the proposal from Valhi, and they
did not do that. It was not whether we valued it higher or lower
than Valhi.''

<HEAD>Washington Rejects Batus Takeover of Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID AMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington's insurance commissioner on
Tuesday rejected an unfriendly takeover of Farmers Insurance Group
by Batus Inc., making his state the fourth to do so.
   ``The policyholders could quite possibly lose from the
acquisition, and they do not stand to gain anything from it,''
Commissioner Dick Marquardt said in an order turning down the
takeover proposal.
   Washington joins Oregon, Idaho and California in rejecting the
$4.5 billion, $63 per share hostile takeover bid. Arizona has
approved the takeover and decisions are pending in Illinois, Ohio,
Kansas and Texas.
   Ed Ives, a spokesman for Marquardt, said an appeal of the order
was certain. Batus, the U.S. arm of British conglomerate BAT
Industries PLC, has 30 days to appeal to the commissioner.
   Marquardt's decision followed nearly a week of hearings in
Seattle last month. As have regulators in other states, he
expressed concern that, if it took over Farmers, there was a
likelihood Batus might drop the company's non-smoker discounts on
auto and homeowner policies.
   Louisville, Ky.-based Batus is the parent of Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp.
   The commissioner also said there was a chance Batus would end
Farmers medical malpractice coverage.
   ``Farmers' withdrawal from this market would have seriously
adverse, anti-competitive effects, particularly in the Washington
market'' and would ``tend to create a monopoly in that line in
Washington,'' he said.
   Farmers Insurance Co. of Washington, based in Vancouver, and
Farmers New World Life, headquartered on Mercer Island, are
affiliates of Farmers Insurance Group of Los Angeles.
   Farmers is the state's largest auto insurance company, writing
17.4 percent of the market, Marquardt said. It ranks third in
homeowner policies, 10th in commercial insurance sales and provides
a quarter of all Washington hospitals with their medical
malpractice coverage.

<HEAD>Western Union Loses $3 Million During Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. posted a
$2.99 million loss during its second quarter, the company announced
Tuesday.
   The latest loss compared to a loss of $990,000 during the same
period in 1987.
   Revenue during the quarter rose to $235 million from $206.5
million.
   The telecommunications company lost $628.2 million during the
first six months of 1988, compared with a $19.8 million loss in the
first half of 1987, due largely to restructuring charges of $603
million in the first quarter, resulting from Western Union's recent
reorganization.
   Revenue during the six-month period rose to $469.5 million from
$411.1 million in the same period a year ago.
   Year-earlier figures do not include revenue from the former ITT
World Communications Inc., which Western Union acquired Dec. 30.
Including income from the business, now known as Worldcom, revenue
would have been $266 million in second quarter 1987 and $522
million in the first half of last year.
   Following a series of unprofitable years, Western Union
completed a plan Dec. 30 to reorganize and move from providing
communications facilities to providing specialized business and
consumer services.
