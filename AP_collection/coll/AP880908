<HEAD>Police: Palestinian Killed Jewish Teen Who Dreamed Of Co-Existence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli teen-ager who dreamed of Jewish-Arab
co-existence and befriended many Arabs in the West Bank was slain
by a Palestinian acquaintance after she refused to get him a gun,
police said Wednesday.
   The Palestinian, whose name was not released, confessed to the
slaying of 18-year-old Ziva Goldovsky and reconstructed the crime
for police, said investigator Uri Weisskoop.
   Ms. Goldovsky's charred remains were found Aug. 15 in a field
near the West Bank town El Bireh. Weisskoop said her assailant
choked her from behind and struck her repeatedly with a large stone
before he and an accomplice set the corpse on fire.
   Ms. Goldovsky became the fifth Israeli to die in the 9-month-old
Palestinian uprising. The Palestinian death toll has reached 259.
   Israel radio described Ms. Goldovsky, an immigrant from the
Soviet Union, as an activist in the left-wing Mapam party ``who
could be found at most pro-Palestinian demonstrations.''
   Ms. Goldovsky, a resident of the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, was
engaged to a Palestinian from the West Bank city of Hebron, friends
of the victim told The Associated Press last month.
   Ms. Goldovsky's fiance, who has a police record, is in custody
on robbery charges but is not a suspect in the slaying, police said.
   On Aug. 13, Ms. Goldovsky and a Palestinian acquaintance went
for a walk near El Bireh and began to argue, Israel radio said.
   The man started hitting her and shouted: ``Why do you dress so
immodestly?'' the report said.
   ``Don't hit me,'' she said. ``Even my parents don't beat me.''
   The man then accused her of being an informer for Israel's Shin
Bet security service. When she denied this, he said: ``Prove it,
get me a pistol.''
   She refused, saying: ``I should get you a gun so you can kill
young Jewish boys and girls?''
   The man again slapped Ms. Goldovsky and then choked her.
   ``He took us to the place where he killed her,'' Weisskoop was
quoted as telling the radio. ``He approached her from behind,
choked her and laid her on the ground.
   ``Then he hit her with a large stone. About 50 yards from the
site of the killing he and a friend burned the body and this is how
she was found.''
   One of Ms. Goldovsky's Jewish friends, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said last month she often hitchhiked to the West Bank
and formed friendships with many Palestinians.
   The friend said Ms. Goldovsky dreamed of Jewish-Arab
co-existence.
   ``Ziva would have continued her road of co-existence even if she
knew what her end would be,'' he said.

<HEAD>Security Council Asked To Act For Iraqi Kurds</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Kurdish leader saying
fighting continues in Iraq. No pickup.</NOTE>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said on Thursday that it has
appealed to the United Nations Security Council to ``act
immediately to stop the massacre of Kurdish civilians by Iraqi
forces.''
   Meanwhile, the leader of the Kurdish rebels said that Iraqi
government troops are still attacking guerrillas and civilians in
northern Iraq despite the government's amnesty offer.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said in a statement that it made its first direct
appeal on Wednesday night to the 15-member U.N. body in New York
because the ``systematic and deliberate'' killings ``call out for
immediate action by the Security Council.''
   The statement charged Iraq wants to punish the Kurds for their
political sympathies and in retaliation for opposition Kurdish
activities. More than 100,000 Iraqi Kurds fled across the border to
Turkey and many of them gave consistent accounts of the use of
chemical weapons, the statement said.
   Amnesty last week accused Iraq of killing hundreds of Kurdish
villagers with chemical weapons in mountainous northern Iraq and of
employing helicopter gunships, tanks and artillery in Duhok, Mosul
and Arbil provinces.
   Iraq's ambassador to Britain, Mohammed Sadiq al-Mashat, denied
chemical weapons were used. He was summoned to the Foreign Office
in London on Tuesday and was told of British concern over the large
numbers of Kurdish refugees and the reports of chemical weapons use.
   The latest Amnesty statement gave a qualified welcome to the
Iraqi amnesty for Kurds, saying it received reports in the past of
Kurds being imprisoned and executed after responding to previous
amnesties.
   Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party,
said in a telex sent to The Associated Press office in Cyprus on
Wednesday that the Kurds will not accept the general amnesty
offered by Iraq the day before.
   ``The Kurds have not struggled to be pardoned but to acheive
their national and democratic rights within autonomy,'' Barzani
said. ``Our struggle will continue until these goals are
fulfilled.''
   Iraq launched the offensive against the Kurdish rebels after a
cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iran went into effect Aug.
20. Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been struggling on and off for 50
years for an autonomous homeland.
   The Kurdistan Democratic Party has said that nearly 2,000
civilians have been killed and another 5,000 injured, many by
chemical weapons.
   In his statement Wednesday, Barzani said the amnesty offer was
an attempt by Iraq to deflect attention from its use of chemical
weapons.

   Republican George Bush stunned an
American Legion convention Wednesday by mistakenly saying Sept. 7
marked the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor that led
America into World War II.
   The gaffe _ which he corrected after prompting from the audience
_ overshadowed a campaign day in which the vice president also
stumped for Jewish votes at a B'nai B'rith convention in Baltimore,
Md.
   Bush said he opposes creation of an independent Palestinian
state in the Middle East, but also cautioned Israel against
annexation of the occupied territories or exercising permanent
control by military occupation.
   In another matter signaling a departure from the Reagan
administration, Bush told Knight-Ridder newspapers Wednesday he
will soon outline a proposal calling for ``some adjustment'' in the
minimum wage.
   The administration opposes raising the minimum wage, which is
now $3.35 an hour. But campaign sources told Knight-Ridder that
Bush was expected to link a raise in the minimum wage to a
sub-minimum wage ``training differential'' for teen-agers and other
new hires. Congress has opposed such a differential in the past.
   ``We ought to maintain a minimum wage differential for training
people,'' Bush said. Bush has been criticized by his opponents as
insensitive to the needs of working people.
   The vice president received encouraging news from the latest ABC
News-Washington Post poll which found Bush leading Dukakis by an
eight-point margin.
   The survey of 1,104 likely voters found that 51 percent favored
Bush while 43 percent prefer Dukakis. The poll, conducted Aug. 31
to Sept. 6, had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
   On the question of a Palestinian state, Bush sharply criticized
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, although he didn't mention him by
name. ``Anyone who has trouble making up his mind on this issue, or
who proposes to leave it open, just doesn't understand the dangers
to Israel and to the United States; just doesn't understand the
very real threats that continue to exist,'' Bush said.
   Bush opened the day in Louisville with a speech before about
6,000 veterans at their 70th annual meeting.
   Departing from his prepared remarks, Bush said, ``I wonder how
many Americans remember today is Pearl Harbor Day. Forty-seven
years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard at Pearl Harbor
and we were not ready.
   ``In a Bush administration that lesson would not be forgotten,''
said Bush, who was a Navy flyer decorated for combat missions
during the war. ``It would guide my defense and foreign policy.''
   The words were barely out of his mouth before the crowd turned
uneasy. A buzz of mumurs rose among the audience as legionnaires
began whispering about it. ``I thought nobody would forget that
date,'' one veteran commented to another.
   A minute after his mistake, Bush stopped dead in his speech,
alerted by the stir in the audience and people waving at him over
his error.
   ``Did I say Sept. 7th? Sorry about that,'' Bush said, adding
quickly that the correct date of the attack was Dec. 7, 1941. The
audience applauded his correction and generally gave him a warm,
polite reception.
   Bush told reporters later, ``I just got messed up. I wanted to
work Pearl Harbor in and just got carried away.''
   It was the second rocky day in a row for Bush's campaign,
following a booing, jeering reception from shipyard workers in
Portland, Ore. on Tuesday.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said the vice president had
ad libbed his Pearl Harbor remark, perhaps because it was 44 years
ago this week that Bush, a decorated Navy flyer in the war, was
shot down on over the Pacific.
   The gaffe marred Bush's attempt to highlight differences with
Dukakis.
   He accused Dukakis of trying to ``cancel and delay our strategic
modernization with what amounts to an undeclared unilateral
freeze.''
   Bush noted that Dukakis opposes the MX and Midgetman missiles,
the Strategic Defense System and has called for cancellation of two
aircraft carrier task forces.
   Bush said Dukakis has opposed the Stealth bomber in the past
``although this may be changing.''
   ``Let me be clear,'' Bush said. ``I do not question his
patriotism. But patriotism is not the issue. The issue is how best
to deter war, to keep the peace, to fulfill our country's special
responsibility as leader of the free world.''
   Bush said, ``I think America wants tough, tested, experienced
leadership .... I am proud of having served my country in combat. I
believe I have the fiber and the experience to lead this country.''
   Later, in Baltimore, Bush underscored the closeness of
U.S.-Israeli relations.
   ``No threat, no stone thrown, is strong enough to divide us. No
wedge will be driven between us,'' Bush pledged.
   In warning against Israeli annexation of the occupied
territories, Bush said, ``There has got to be another way, and
that's what the peace process is all about.''
   Bush said he opposes creation of a Palestinian state on grounds
it would be a threat to Israel as well as to Jordan, which he said
is crucial to any lasting peace settlement.
   Moreover, he said, ``it would be contrary to American
interests.''
   On the flight from Louisville to Baltimore, Bush said that
anti-abortion protestors who disrupted Dukakis' speech Tuesday in a
Chicago suburb ``in my view went too far.''
   Bush, who opposes abortion in most instances, said, ``I would
ask any supporter of mine to resist carrying their right to
demonstrate to an extreme.''
   Explaining his gaffe, Bush explained: ``I just got messed up. I
wanted to work Pearl Harbor in and just got carried away, and then
I looked up and saw incredulity on the face of one particular guy
down to my left and I thought, `Whoops...My Heavens! I've done it!'
So I was glad to correct it.''

<HEAD>Calif. County Moves To Save Fairy Shrimp's Skunk Hollow Swimming
Hole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MURRIETA HOT SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny Riverside fairy shrimps
can keep splashing around in their swimming hole thanks to county
supervisors who ordered developers to help save the recently
discovered fresh-water crustacean.
   Developers planned to bulldoze a low-lying pond and build more
than 2,500 homes, unaware that the species, whose ancestors date
back millions of years, occupied the seasonal pool.
   Riverside County supervisors on Tuesday ordered The Tolman Co.
of Irvine to preserve the threatened habitat after they were
alerted by biologists who discovered the fairy shrimp species two
years ago.
   The 22-legged fairy shrimp is about as wide as a pencil and 1{
inches long. It has been described by biologists as the most
primitive crustacean living in fresh water.
   A group of biologists named the species the Riverside fairy
shrimp after finding them in 15-acre Skunk Hollow pond and five
smaller ponds in southern Riverside County, about 80 miles
southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   The fairy shrimp population survives dry summer months by
burying eggs in the clay soil of the seasonal pools. The eggs of
some desert species have been known to survive for as long as 25
years between adequate rains.
   The Board of Supervisors gave the developer and the biologists
until Sept. 27 to come up with a proposal that would permit the
survival of the fairy shrimp and Tolman's proposed 2,571-unit
housing project.

   Robert Wilke parlayed $500 and frugality into
a quarter-million-dollar estate, but after eight decades of tending
his finances' growth, his harvest is heartache. At age 103, his
yield is unhappiness.
   A family feud has grown up over who should handle his money and
how his estate should be divided. As a result, the courts have
declared him incompetent and placed him and his personal wealth
under guardianships.
   Advocates for the elderly say proposed reforms in Pennsylvania's
guardianship law might have spared him anguish and indignities in
old age, including three medical examinations and the loss of many
of his rights.
   On the one side are Wilke and his two sons, Robert, 60, and
William, 54. On the other side are his two daughters, Frances
McAleer, 62, and Sylvia Eaborn, 50, who successfully petitioned a
judge to declare him incompetent and to appoint guardians to make
his personal and financial decisions.
   It was in the midst of the incompetency hearings in April that
Wilke's wife of 63 years, Amelia, died at age 89, and his mourning
for her mixes with bitterness toward his daughters, with whom he no
longer speaks.
   ``Both daughters wanted to take everything over that I worked
all my life for,'' Wilke contends, even though an audit found no
impropriety when Mrs. McAleer was handling his day-to-day finances.
   ``I can't even spend my money after saving it,'' complains
Wilke, who started work at age 15 for a dollar-and-a-half a week.
``When you think you got money, you ain't got nothin'.''
   He never earned more than $4,200 a year in 57 years of work as a
machinist and maintenance engineer. He retired at age 72.
   He started saving when he was 29 by putting $500 from his share
of the family house, sold upon his father's death, into five banks.
   Shopping for bargains and rarely traveling, Wilke saved and
saved. His will provided that each of his children would receive
one-fourth of the accumulated wealth.
   After he and his wife entered a nursing home, he asked his elder
daughter in late 1986 to help with his bill-paying and other
accounts and gave her legal authority under a power of attorney.
   Still, he continued to monitor his finances, and at one point
their figures conflicted. Father accused daughter of being unable
to explain how $20,000 was spent.
   Last October, Wilke transferred his power of attorney to his
sons. He also changed his will to make the sons executors instead
of the daughters.
   ``I cried the whole day,'' Mrs. McAleer testified. ``My heart
was broken that my father would do this to me without telling me.''
   Mrs. McAleer and her sister filed the incompetency petition 2{
weeks later, and an Orphans Court judge declared Wilke incompetent
on June 1, naming the Pittsburgh National Bank as his financial
guardian and a lawyer as his personal guardian.
   The incompetency petition upset Wilke so much that he rewrote
his will in March. Now, the daughters are to receive 10 percent
each, the sons 40 percent each.
   The daughters declined to be interviewed, but their lawyer,
Geoffrey P. Wozman, said they apparently ``wanted protection''
after Mrs. McAleer was accused.
   ``I don't think they particularly thought the sons were going to
take his money. They didn't think the sons were the proper people
to take care of it. They didn't think they were either. No matter
who controls the money, someone is going to complain they're not
doing something right,'' Wozman said.
   Explaining why the guardianship was sought, the lawyer said the
old man was not ``rational in terms of financial affairs.''
   A psychiatrist testifying for the daughters said Wilke was
incompetent ``due to the infirmities of old age.'' Another
psychiatrist testified for the sons that while Wilke needed help
managing his finances, he found no evidence of incompetency. A
third psychiatrist, appointed by the court, examined Wilke seven
weeks after he was declared incompetent and concluded that he is
``suffering from some mild cognitive impairment.''
   When the guardianship was declared, Wilke lost the right to
vote, to make decisions about his own health care and to travel
without approval from his guardian.
   Against his wishes, he was initially ordered back into a nursing
home. Later, the judge allowed him to continue to live with son
William in suburban Green Tree, where he had moved after his wife's
death. The elder Wilke is permitted to keep his monthly $537 Social
Security check and his $210 pension check for expenses and for
spending money.
   ``I think the Wilke case provides an example of flaws in our
current state law,'' said Dr. Linda M. Rhodes, secretary of the
Pennsylvania Department of Aging.
   Among proposed legal changes now before the Legislature is a
provision to authorize limited guardianships for people who are
only ``partially incapacitated,'' as two doctors found Wilke to be.
   A number of states already allow such guardianships, which
tailor assistance to specific areas, such as managing a person's
income and assets, while leaving most rights intact.
   Current Pennsylvania law does not recognize partial incompetence
and allows only for a blanket guardianship, under which virtually
all decision-making is turned over to someone else.
   ``Here's an individual who could use some assistance in
financial planning but certainly he can make choices we all make
every day,'' Mrs. Rhodes said of Wilke.
   At a Department of Aging hearing last month, Wilke himself
testified in favor of the reform bill, which would also eliminate
``infirmities of old age'' as a reason for a finding of
incompetency. An individual's faculties, not birth date, should be
the deciding factor, department officials have argued.
   Meanwhile, Wilke is challenging the incompetency finding. A
hearing is set before an Orphans Court panel Sept. 12.
   As he sits in a rocking chair, watching the news or the Pirates
ballgames, the white-haired man ponders what he'll do if he's
declared competent and gets control of his money again.
   He'll pay off some bills, he says, and visit his son Robert, who
lives in Tallahassee, Fla. William says his father also feels he
should pay him and his wife, Margaret, for his care and shelter, no
more than $1,000.
   But reconciliation with his daughters is not in the cards.
   ``They're looking out for themselves, not me,'' he said. ``It
hurt me a lot. I just can't forget.''

<HEAD>Black Medical School In South Africa Debunks Skeptics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   GA-RANKUWA, South Africa (AP) _ A creation of apartheid
politics, South Africa's black medical school is producing 70 badly
needed doctors a year, and even those who oppose it concede it is
advancing black medicine in the country.
   South Africa has 26 million blacks but only about 800 black
doctors, as opposed to more than 21,000 white doctors among its 5
million whites.
   When the Medical University of Southern Africa was established
11 years ago in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, however, many
activists rejected the school as an inferior institution built to
keep medical training segregated.
   However, modern facilities and a qualified staff have helped the
university graduate 273 doctors who work in some of the country's
best hospitals as well as remote rural areas where health workers
are in severely short supply.
   ``The students reject the idea of segregated education, but we
accept that we are getting good training,'' said a 26-year-old
student asking to be identified only as Gwen.
   The school's new buildings and landscaped grounds sit behind a
barbed-wire fence 20 miles outside Pretoria, the capital. The
pristine campus appears out of place in dusty, run-down Ga-Rankuwa,
a sprawling collection of dirt roads and squatter shacks.
   Many of the prospective doctors come from similarly impoverished
communities. Some students arriving for the six-year program live
with electricity for the first time, and most have little or no
experience in laboratories.
   ``When students come here, they face tremendous adjustments,''
said the vice principal, Len Karlsson, who is white, as are all the
top administrators. ``The pace and the intensity of the program is
unlike anything they've experienced previously.''
   He said black public high schools do not adequately prepare
students for the rigors of medical school, and therefore the
university often selects older students with some practical medical
experience.
   About half the students are at least 25 years old and most have
worked in the health care field before enrolling, said Karlsson.
   The university offers remedial courses in most basic subjects,
but the failure rate remains high. About 40 percent of the 120
first-year students fail, although they are given the chance to
repeat.
   The university is expanding its entering class annually and is
one of the largest medical schools in Africa with about 1,500
students including its denistry, veterinary, nursing and
post-graduate programs.
   The school, referred to by the acronym MEDUNSA, produces half of
South Africa's 140 new black physicians each year. The rest come
from schools that are predominantly white, such as the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   ``MEDUNSA is producing some outstanding doctors,'' said Dr.
Nthato Motlana, a prominent anti-apartheid activist who runs a
clinic in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg.
   Motlana and other activists initially opposed MEDUNSA, calling
it a ``racist plan to build black medical school out in the bush.''
   Motlana still opposes segregated schools, but says MEDUNSA has
served to increase the meager supply of black doctors.
   Health services remain segregated, and the shortage of doctors
and facilities is acute in most black areas.
   Johannesburg's main white hospitals are about 50 percent empty,
while an average of more than 200 patients sleep on the floor each
night at Soweto's 2,700-bed Baragwanath Hospital, the only
full-service health facility for the township's 2.5 million
residents.
   Despite the overcrowding at black hospitals in urban areas, the
quality of care is much higher than in rural areas where the
doctors are far too few and the facilities often inadequate or
non-existent, Motlana said.
   MEDUNSA encourages graduates who want to work in rural areas,
but most students are from the cities and see no incentive to
relocate, school officials and students said.
   To combat the dearth of rural doctors, black homeland
governments provide scholarships for MEDUNSA students, who then are
required to return to work in the territories for several years
after graduation.
   ``Until its becomes attrative for doctors to practice in rural
areas most blacks will have trouble getting adequate health care,''
said Motlana. ``MEDUNSA has helped the situation, but it is not
enough by itself.''
   The university is financially supported by the South African
government, but students are required to pay a tuition the
equivalent of about $2,500 a year.
   Virturally every student receives some form of financial aid,
however.
   School officials say U.S. companies were generous with
scholarship money, but many of them have pulled out of South Africa
because of its apartheid policies and no longer donate funds.
   School officials didn't have exact figures on the reduction in
American assistance, but said its amounts to thousands of dollars
annually. Some U.S.-based firms still operating in South Africa,
including 3M, Colgate, and Johnson and Johnson, continue to provide
scholarship money.

   Buddhists in Burma kill each other
while saffron-robed monks shake fists against the government,
violating a 2,500-year-old rule against taking life and a tradition
of Buddhist clergy shunning politics.
   Buddhist societies from Sri Lanka to South Korea, Burma to Tibet
have proved as prone to violence as others in recent times despite
the precepts of Lord Buddha, the great religious teacher of the 5th
century B.C.
   Cambodia, once a land of 90,000 monks in scores of quiet
temples, was turned into a killing field by the savage Khmer Rouge.
The current government says 3 million died in the 1975-78 reign of
terror.
   In wartime South Vietnam, protesting monks set themselves afire.
More recently, conflict between the majority Sinhalese Buddhists
and Hindu Tamils have left more than 8,000 dead in Sri Lanka.
   A monk in Burma told an American visitor: ``If the government
doesn't change, the only way to prevent shedding the people's blood
is to fight them to the death.''
   The image of Buddhist gentleness persists, however. Proponents
like to say Buddhists have not waged crusades or burned heretics at
the stake, as Christians did, or established anything akin to
today's strident Islamic states.
   Southeast Asia's Theravada Buddhism, one of the religion's two
major branches, places special emphasis on tolerance, equanimity
and non-confrontation.
   William Klausner, an American expert on Thai culture, says
Buddhists try to avoid the confrontational behavior _ a sharp word,
a push, a slap _ others might employ in a situation of conflict.
   ``Violence is the last resort,'' he said, ``but when the
eruption comes it's going to be more dramatic. The Thais say there
is little maneuvering room between the smile and the knife.''
   Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, a religion professor at Bangkok's
Thammasat University, believes Buddhism to a large extent explains
why the Burmese put up with 26 years of authoritarian misrule
before rising up last month.
   Demonstrating along with students and workers were monks who, at
least in Theravada tradition, are enjoined to restrict their
activities to the sprititual.
   But monks marched, gave fiery speeches and were said to have
largely replaced the government in Mandalay, Burma's second-largest
city and a great religious cener.
   Klausner said in an interview that monks in Sri Lanka, Burma and
to some degree Vietnam had ``legitimized a politial role for
themselves.''
   When Britain was the colonial power in Burma, it reduced the
power of the monkhood, or ``sangha,'' and the Buddhist clergy
assumed a political role, helping expel the alien, Christian
conquerors. Burma became independent in 1948.
   Some analysts say many monks similarly regarded the socialism of
military strongman Ne Win as an alien ideology and resented his
efforts to co-opt and control clergy after he seized power in 1962.
   A strain of aggressiveness is a long-standing characteristic of
Mahayana Buddhism, practiced in Japan, Korea, China and Tibet.
   Buddhist-backed groups in 16th century Japan would band together
to overthrow feudal lords, and the monks of the Shaolin Temple in
China were noted for truculence and their skill as warriors. The
Shaolin Temple remains a center for the study of martial arts.
   About 70 people have been injured in recent fueding between the
main Chokey sect in South Korea and its rivals. The antagonists,
including monks, have attacked one another with clubs, iron pipes
and knives.
   Although Tibet's exiled religious leader, the Dalai Lama, urges
non-violent resistance to Chinese rule, young Buddhist monks led
riots last year and in March. They were involved in throwing rocks,
burning vehicles and the death of a policeman who was beaten and
flung from a monastery window.
   In a little-publicized conflict, Buddhist rebels called Chakmas
raid villages and battle authorities in eastern Bangladesh to halt
government efforts to settle Moslems on land traditionally held by
Buddhists. At least 4,000 people have been killed, by official
count.
   Thailand, which calls itself the ``Land of Smiles,'' has one of
Asia's highest homicide rates periodic outbursts of brutality.
   Faced with mounting evidence in the early 1980s that Thai
pirates were killing and raping Vietnamese ``boat people,'' several
officials said the equivalent of: ``They can't be Thais. Thais are
Buddhists and Buddhists wouldn't act like that.''
   Buddhist scholars say much of this violence, and political
activism by the clergy, results from rapid modernization, economic
inequalities and political repression.
   Chatsumarn, the Bangkok professor, said in an interview:
``Buddhism molds the mentality to be tolerant, to bear all, but
even good Buddhists can't live solely on religion. Basic needs must
be met and stomachs filled.''

<HEAD>Neighbors Remember Slain IRA Man As `Friendly Lad'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SIXMILECROSS, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elderly manager of a
hardware store in this farming village remembered Brian Mullin as
``a friendly lad,'' a bricklayer who often dropped by for supplies.
   ``He just got caught up in the troubles because he knew nothing
else,'' the manager said. ``He's only one of hundreds of young men
in the area who have been harassed every day by the security
forces.''
   Mullin, 25, and two other local Irish Republican Army men died
in a British army ambush Aug. 30 as they drove along a country road
near Drumnakilly, 5 miles north of here.
   Their funerals over the weekend drew mourners from all around
the area and hundreds of riot police. The mourners, mostly
Catholic, and the police, mostly Protestant, faced each other in
stony silence. Physically, they were inches apart. Mentally, a gulf
separated them.
   Police said the three dead men were armed and dressed in ski
masks when they died. The London newspapers called them terrorists,
murderers and ``IRA rats.''
   But in the countryside of County Tyrone, many residents knew
these part-time guerrillas or their families and spoke of them in
sympathetic terms.
   Their deaths helped exacerbate the divisions between local
Catholics and the IRA's most frequent targets in rural districts _
the police and the Ulster Defense Regiment.
   ``There's a majority of Protestants with nothing wrong with
them,'' said a 28-year-old decorator sitting on a grassy bank
outside Dunmoyle Catholic Church on Saturday waiting for Mullin's
hearse to pass.
   ``It's those that join the security forces we can't live with,''
he said, glancing at policemen searching mourners at a crossroads
at the start of a two-mile trek to Mullin's family farm outside
Sixmilecross.
   Like the store manager, he spoke on condition of anonymity,
fearing retaliation for criticizing the police.
   ``If you come up this road at 2 or 3 in the morning, and you're
stopped by them, you're sure to get a kicking because of who you
are,'' he said. ``The police force would be welcome, surely, if
they were 50-50 (Catholic-Protestant) and they were fair.''
   The police and army say they can't get Catholic recruits because
the IRA would kill them as collaborators.
   William Gallagher, 53, of Strabane in neighboring County
Fermanagh, said he was a ``political activist'' with two sons
serving lengthy prison sentences for IRA bombings.
   ``The British never listen to anything except a gun,'' he said.
``You couldn't name three countries the British have not been at
war with.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the 95
percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Like many IRA recruits in rural districts alongside the Irish
Republic's border, the slain men led double lives, their IRA
activities camouflaged by ordinary civilian pursuits.
   Brothers Gerard and Martin Harte, who were buried Friday in
their nearby home village of Loughmacrory, were leading players in
the local Gaelic football team.
   Gerard Harte, a 29-year-old architect, designed his own
grandiose house overlooking the village. His 21-year-old brother
was a carpenter. Both were married, Martin Harte to Mullin's
sister, and each had an infant son.
   Police said Gerard Harte was the commander of the IRA's
mid-Tyrone unit and that his brother was responsible for selecting
IRA targets from police and Ulster Defense Regiment ranks.
   Mullin, whose elder brother Patrick is serving a life sentence
for the 1977 IRA murder of a bus driver, was questioned after a
bomb killed eight British soldiers Aug. 20 in a bus in nearby
Ballygawley. He was released without charge after five days.
   News reports said the trio were on their way to kill an off-duty
member of the Ulster Defense Regiment when soldiers ambushed their
stolen car. The government says the IRA men fired first.
   At Mullin's funeral, riot squads massed to block any repetition
of the IRA gun salutes that have sparked clashes with police at
previous burials.
   The 2,000 mourners inched along narrow country lanes, flanked by
long lines of police in helmets, guns and riot shields. They
trudged through rain-sodden fields, climbing over ditches and
hedges and scattering cows and sheep.
   When one policeman fell over a barbed-wire fence, the crowd
roared approval.
   Police ringed the church walls during the Mass, sometimes
banging batons against shields in what sounded like a tribal beat.
   Three officers videotaped the crowd, and a helicopter clattered
overhead, almost drowning out the graveside prayers.
   When the service ended, the crowd quickly dispersed. The weather
switched from driving rain to warm sunshine, and the tensions from
the 3{-hour service lifted.

   NBC made it 11 in a row in the weekly A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings, but as summer reruns dragged into September,
not that many people were watching.
   Reruns of ABC's ``Full House'' and CBS' ``Designing Women''
turned up in the top 10, but they were behind five NBC comedies.
   ``Full House'' is being broadcast two nights a week. A Tuesday
episode came in sixth, but the episode on Friday, the regular time
period, was 40th.
   The top 10 shows last week were: NBC's ``A Different World,''
``Cheers,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Night Court'' and ``Golden
Girls,'' ABC's ``Full House,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' and ``Amen'';
and a tie between CBS' ``Blood and Orchids, Part Two'' and
``Designing Women'' and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   NBC finished the week with an average, prime-time rating of
11.6; CBS 10.8; and ABC 9.3. The network averages for the season
that began 50 weeks ago are: NBC 14.5, CBS 12.3 and ABC 12.1. The
three-network share of the total viewing audience was 60, up
somewhat from the the previous week's 56. The all-time low, set
this summer, was 47.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes
with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' regained the lead in the news race with
an average rating of 9.8 and a 21 share. ``ABC World News Tonight''
had a 9.4 and 20; ``NBC Nightly News'' an 8.8 and 19.

   Four decades after its founding, North Korea
remains an isolated, secretive state with an enigmatic leader who
shows no signs of handing over power to his designated heir _ his
son.
   The Democratic People's Republic of Korea celebrates its 40th
anniversary Friday with praise for President Kim Il Sung, 76, the
communist strongman.
   The country plans a huge celebration, with senior foreign
emissaries including President Yang Shangkun of China and Soviet
KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov representing North Korea's two major
allies.
   No political figures or journalists from the West have been
invited, and requests from Western news agencies to cover the
anniversary have gone unanswered. North Korea rarely allows Western
journalists into the country.
   The ceremonies Friday will include a mass rally, a sports
competition and cultural performances in praise of Kim.
   ``Koreans respect Kim Il Sung as a prominent leader in
anti-Japanese warfare and hero of the Korean revolution,'' said
Choe Kwan Ick, an official of the pro-North Korean General
Association of Korean Residents of Japan (Chongryon). ``He goes to
every corner of the country, among farmers and workers, to solve
problems they face. The people respect this, and that is why he has
remained in power so long.''
   A 1986 U.S. State Department report called Kim ``the object of
an intensive and far-reaching personality cult, probably unequalled
in the rest of today's world.''
   Huge statues of the Great Leader, as Kim is known, stand
throughout the country and almost all North Koreans wear badges
with his picture.
   Similar public loyalty to Kim's son Kim Jong Il, 46, is
encouraged. The elder Kim plans to hand power over to his son in
what may be the world's first communist dynasty.
   It has been a troubling year for North Korea. World attention
has focused on rival South Korea and on the upcoming Olympic Games,
which begin in Seoul Sept. 17. South Korea has stressed security
preparations against a possible terrorist attack from the north.
   North Korea finally stated this week that it would not use
military or other means to interrupt the Olympics.
   ``As for `terrorism,' it is utterly alien to us and the United
States itself is the chieftain of state terrorism as already
exposed to the world,'' the North Korean Foreign Ministry said.
   Tension remains high along the Demilitarized Zone with North
Korea's deployment of Soviet-made missiles and jet fighters,
including MiG-23s and MiG-29s. The North has an estimated 850,000
troops _ the world's fifth largest army _ against 650,000 South
Korean and 42,000 American soldiers.
   North Korea failed in its attempt to share in the glory of the
Olympics, and is now watching allies China, Yugoslavia, Hungary and
probably Poland establish trade relations with Seoul.
   Eclipsed by South Korea in industry and foreign trade, the
country faces two formidable tasks: ensuring a smooth transfer of
power and modernizing its economy.
   The country has a foreign debt of about $4.2 billion against
foreign trade of only $3.5 billion annually, according to Western
estimates. Last year,North Korea was declared in default on its
foreign loans.
   Trade is modest, amounting to only $1.7 billion annually with
the Soviet Union, North Korea's largest trading partner and main
economic benefactor.
   ``They (North Korea) import machinery and vehicles, but lack
parts and skill and can't get them repaired,'' a Japanese
intelligence official said.
   To earn badly needed foreign currency, North Korea is on a
building spree of luxury hotels and sports and cultural facilities,
but ``they're building everything literally by hand, with shovels
and wheelbarrows,'' the official said.
   ``It reminds me of Japan in the 1950s,'' said Masaru Nishida, a
literature professor at Tokyo's Hosei University who has visited
the country three times.
   Strapped for cash, North Korea has been shifting some of the 20
percent of its GNP currently spent on the military to joint
ventures with the Soviet Union, according to the Japanese official.
The products include household goods, clothing, shoes and are sold
in Siberia.
   ``North Korea wants to cut down military expenditures because
they're a waste of money,'' said Choe. Authorities have demobilized
200,000 soldiers in the last two years and shifted them to economic
reconstruction, he said.
   How to solidify the political position of Kim's son is a more
delicate issue. Little is known about Kim Jong Il, but he clearly
lacks the charisma of his father, the Japanese official said.
   Kim Pyong Il, 34, Kim Jong Il's half-brother, has been posted as
ambassador to Hungary in an apparent move to avoid a challenge to
Kim Jong Il, the official said.
   A major question is when Kim Il Sung will abdicate in favor of
his son _ or be forced to for health reasons. During a visit to
Mongolia in July, he had difficulty climbing slopes and once
abandoned an attempt to enter a pavillion because he could not
negotiate the stairs, the Japanese official said.
   ``Kim Il Sung wants quickly to give reins to his son,'' the
official said. ``But the domestic situation doesn't allow that
right now.'' He said Moscow and Beijing had been pressuring Kim not
to put his son in power yet because they do not have complete
confidence in him.

   Don't try to tell Joe Camerada about Madonna,
Tom Selleck or Elvis. He's got his own idol: Barnaby Jones.
   ``I just like his easygoing style,'' Camerada says.
   Camerada is not alone. He is one of more than 800 members of the
Barnaby Jones Fan Club, dedicated to the memory of the venerable
detective who ambled across the nation's television screens from
1973 to 1980, and in countless reruns.
   Unlike most fan clubs, the members of this one actually get to
meet their idol regularly. Buddy Ebsen, who played Jones, is a
frequent guest at the club's weekly meetings at a restaurant off
Times Square.
   ``It's a cult now,'' says Ebsen, 80. ``I love them. They're
great guys.''
   The great guys are mostly retired executives, men of Ebsen's own
generation. They include former President Richard M. Nixon, a fan
of the show who joined the club at Ebsen's suggestion.
   This fan club collects no dues, sells nothing, follows no rules
and only loosely organizes an occasional golf outing. ``It is
instantaneous. You walk in and you're a member,'' said member Joe
Desimone, 57.
   ``It really was a sincere, grass-roots germination,'' Ebsen said.
   President Alfred Lamberti said the club started some years ago
when a retired Army colonel was hospitalized for an operation. Each
day, the patient watched Barnaby Jones reruns, and soon he and his
visitors were hooked.
   Thereafter, they met for lunch or drinks each week. They would
send Ebsen birthday cards each year. His curiosity was piqued, and
one day he dropped in to La Vert-Galant, official meeting place of
the BJFC.
   Now, whenever he's in town, Ebsen is a regular. And when he
shows up, the bartender whips up an alcoholic drink that looks like
the favored drink of the club's favorite detective _ a glass of
milk.
   The meetings are not like Trekkie conventions _ there are no
trivia contests, with questions of what color tie Barnaby wore in
episode 33; there is no swap meet of Barnaby memorabilia.
   Mostly, the guys talk about sex, fights, baseball and dirty
jokes.
   ``It's like a family,'' said Gordon McKay, 60.
   The club has attracted Ebsen lookalikes and a Scottish man who,
like Jones, drank only milk. There are members in Ireland,
California and Florida.
   Then there was the visit from Nixon. Ebsen, who is on the board
of directors of Nixon's library, said he recruited Nixon into the
club when Nixon asked him why the Barnaby Jones private detective
show was taken off the air in New York and how he could help get it
back on.
   Now, said Ebsen, ``He's a card-carrying member.''
   When Nixon stopped by, more than 40 members gathered at the
restaurant and listened to plenty of behind-the-scenes stuff, as
Lamberti recalls.
   ``He was going to stay a half hour but he stayed two hours,'' he
said. ``He told us things about Washington that I can't tell you.
He said of all the clubs he ever went to this was the greatest
because there was no ulterior motive.''
   Nixon also figured in another big moment in club history _ the
time members rented a yacht and followed Ebsen in a race around
Staten Island.
   ``I had a Richard Nixon mask on,'' Lamberti said, with a chuckle.
   Ebsen said he recalls racing in the Liberty Regatta. There,
tagging along behind him, was a yacht bearing a large banner.
   ``Go Barnaby,'' the sign said.

   The Norwegian Nobel Committee says it will
choose this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate from 97 candidates,
including 74 people and 23 organizations.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
reportedly are in the running for their agreement to dismantle
intermediate range nuclear missiles.
   Jakob Sverdrup, secretary of the five-member committee, said
Wednesday that the winner will be announced Sept. 29 by chairman
Egil Aarvik.
   The number of approved candidates is close to the all-time
record of 100. Last year, President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica was
chosen from among 93 candidates for his Central American peace plan.
   The committee refuses to confirm the names of candidates.
Nominations for the 1988 prize closed on Feb. 1
   Speculation has focused on United Nations' General Secretary
Javier Perez de Cuellar, who reportedly was nominated for the 1989
prize by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany
for his efforts to end the Iran-Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
   A Norwegian member of parliament has said he has proposed
President Cory Aquino for her efforts for a peaceful tranisition in
the Philippines.
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway reportedly was
nominated for her U.N.-appointed work on drafting a program for
environment and development.
   Other unconfirmed nominations were jailed black anti-apartheid
leader Nelson Mandela of South Africa, and Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
   Members of Finland's parliament reportedly have nominated the
World Health Organization (WHO) celebrating its 40th anniversary
this year, and Swedish parliamentarians proposed the Rev. Joseph
Ingle of the Nashville-based Southern Coalition on Jails and
Prisons, who campaigns against the death penalty.
   This prize is worth about $385,000, up 15 percent from last year.

   A visiting-card case made from the skin
of executed 19th century mass murderer William Burke was bought at
auction for $1,785 by a man whose business takes tourists to the
scenes of notorious crimes.
   ``The price was much more than Burke and William Hare, his
accomplice, received for all the bodies of their victims, which
they sold to anatomists,'' said Robin Mitchell, who bought the
relic in a sale at Knowle in central England.
   Burke and Hare, who began as grave-robbers, went on to murder at
least 15 people in Edinburgh in 1827 and 1828, a time when medical
professors could not get enough bodies for demonstrations to their
students.
   Burke was hanged in 1829 on the evidence of Hare, who fled the
city and disappeared.
   Burke's body was flayed after dissection by Edinburgh's medical
authorities and part of his skin was used by one of those surgeons
to make the ornate case with gold tooling which passed to his
descendant _ who sold it Wednesday.
   A notebook covered in Burke's skin is still in the possession of
Edinburgh's Royal College of Surgeons.
   Mitchell is a partner in an Edinburgh guide business, which
takes tourists to the scenes of notorious crimes.
   ``We will be showing the case to our clients on the tours,'' he
said.

   Under the agreement, the two radio networks will co-produce an
anthology of traditional Chinese music and other programs. Radio
reporters will receive technical assistance in the country they are

   Quiba, Jamal, Zubag, Kubla Khan and six
pals give new meaning to the expression ``dog's life.''
   Every canine should be as lucky as the 10 silky Salukis who
share a posh Marin County doghouse with color television, art
gallery and raised beds with white fur blankets.
   ``I just thoroughly love them,'' Sandra Wornum said Wednesday of
her pampered purebreds.
   Wornum built the $15,000 enclosed kennels partly to appease
neighbors, who complain about noise and worry about property
values, but also out of devotion to her thin, elegant hounds,
believed to be the world's oldest breed.
   The carpeted dog home designed by Wornum's architect husband,
Michael, also features four redwood-and-glass bedrooms and a
bathroom with a Moroccan tile shower and claw-footed bathtub.
   Salukis, which resemble greyhounds, were developed in the Middle
East as early as 4000 B.C. for hunting gazelles. Wornum, like other
lovers of the breed, say their animals are delightfully different
from other dogs.
   ``Their demeanor is much more like a cat,'' she said. ``They are
reserved, quiet, intense. They like to sit up high and observe.
They are not ground sleepers.''

   A baggage handler may keep the $10,000 he
found at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport, authorities say.
But his wife says she still feels bad for whoever lost the cash.
   ``We had kind of hoped the guy who lost it would have gotten
it,'' said Gloria Shergi.
   Allegheny County Deputy Solicitor Ira Weiss said Wednesday that
Patrick Shergi may keep the cash because the owner hasn't turned up.
   ``To date, no one has satisfactorily established that he or she
is the owner of the property,'' Weiss wrote.
   The law states that ``reasonable time'' must elapse before a
finder may claim the goods. Weiss said a month is sufficient.
   Shergi found the hundred $100 bills Aug 3 in a bag beside a curb.
   Publicity about the discovery brought claims of ownership from
more than a dozen people who telephoned police, but none was able
to provide convincing evidence.
   Mrs. Shergi said her husband never thought twice about turning
the money over to authorities.
   ``He is probably one of the most honest people I've ever met,''
she said. ``He never would have been able to sleep, worrying about
whether someone had lost the money and really needed it.''

<HEAD>TVA Names Successor To Nuclear Chief White</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver Kingsley Jr., a retired Navy
man with more than 20 years experience in nuclear energy, was hired
Wednesday to succeed Steven A. White as head of the Tennessee
Valley Authority's nuclear program.
   White, 59, has run TVA's nuclear program since January 1986,
five months after the federal utility shut down its five-reactor
system because of safety and management concerns.
   Since then, Unit 2 at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant outside Chattanooga
has returned to operation and Unit 1 is scheduled for restart later
this month. Browns Ferry Unit 2 is expected to be back on line by
next spring.
   Kingsley, vice president of nuclear operations for Systems
Energy Resources Inc., in Jackson, Miss., will join TVA on Oct. 1
and assume command of the nuclear program a month later.
   TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon revealed Kingsley's appointment and
White's resignation during a TVA board meeting in Tupelo, Miss.
   ``Steve White has done an excellent job of starting the TVA
nuclear program on its way to complete recovery,'' Runyon said in a
statement released in Chattanooga.
   ``His assignment is essentially complete and he has stated
several times that he wants to return home to his farm in Virginia.
TVA appreciates the work he has done in making our nuclear program
safer,'' Runyon said.
   White indicated in recent weeks that he would probably leave the
$355,200-a-year job in January 1989 when his contract expires to be
with his family in Charlottsville, Va.
   The retired admiral who once headed the Navy's nuclear submarine
program has also been under fire from congressional staffers
critical of TVA's nuclear program.
   The U.S. Department of Justice is still investigating claims by
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that White lied in March 1986
when he told the NRC that TVA's unlicensed Watts Bar Nuclear Plant
near Spring City, Tenn., met certain safety standards.
   White has denied the charges, and Gerald Charnoff, an attorney
for TVA, said he expects the investigation to be dismissed soon.
   Like White, Kingsley is an ex-Navy officer, retiring in 1971 to
join Alabama Power Co. as senior engineer in nuclear production.
   Unlike him, he will be paid as a TVA employee, not a contractor,
and his $77,200 salary will be governed by a federal pay cap. He
also will receive a $100,000 cash relocation incentive and $40,000
in retirement benefits.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force officer who heads the nation's
anti-missile program says tens of billions of dollars could be cut
from the program to develop a ``Star Wars'' system.
   Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson says in an interview in today's New
York Times that the design of the weapons to be used in the system
can be simplified and that the Reagan administration's deployment
date of the late 1990s still could be met.
   He said the savings can be made by changing the design of a few
major components, including the space-based anti-missile rockets
that would be the most expensive element of the program.
   ``We're not trying to restructure the program,'' Abrahamson
stressed.
   He said his proposal was developed over the last several months
at the request of Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and will be
presented to top Pentagon officials in about two weeks.
   The Pentagon told Congress last year that development of the
first phase of the Strategic Defense Initiative would cost between
$75 billion and $150 billion.
   Estimates of the long-term cost of the program have ranged as
high as $1 trillion.

   A woman who successfully fought the city's

charged with possessing $40 worth of heroin and two hypodermic
needles, police said.
   Joyce Brown, who also has used the name Billie Boggs, was
arrested on the street Wednesday evening, shortly after she was
discharged from a hospital, authorities said.
   She was charged with criminal possession of a controlled
substance, a misdemeanor because of the amount of heroin recovered,
and issued a desk appearance ticket to return to court Sept. 28,
said Officer Peter O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   Ms. Brown, 40, was admitted to St. Clare's Hospital on Aug. 29,
but neither the hospital nor her lawyers would say what was wrong
with her. She was discharged Wednesday, said Rose Viera, a nursing
supervisor.
   Ms. Brown was the first person picked up last fall under Mayor
Edward I. Koch's plan to hospitalize some of the mentally ill
homeless. She was released when a judge ruled that city doctors,
who contended she was psychotic, could not force her to take
medication for the condition.
   She later moved into a hotel.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Windblown embers from a
165,000-acre forest fire ignited rooftops Wednesday inside the Old
Faithful Geyser complex of Yellowstone National Park, after
hundreds of tourists evacuated the area.
   At least 17 buildings were destroyed as the big North Fork fire
moved into the outskirts of the complex Wednesday afternoon when
40-mph winds shifted, creating a wall of flame that forced 40
firefighters to retreat from the lines.
   ``When that firestorm went through there, we had to move our
people out of there,'' said Denny Bungarz, fire incident commander.
``When you can feel the heat inside your car, it's time to move.''
   Embers rained down on firefighters who wetted roofs inside the
complex and activated a sprinkler atop the historic Old Faithful
Inn to protect the 84-year-old log building, a national historic
landmark since 1987.
   Two cabins in the employee housing area were destroyed by the
wall of flame and winds gusting to 50 mph showered sparks into the
complex, igniting the roofs of 14 other guest cabins and a utility
shed, Bungarz said.
   As winds died down late Wednesday night, authorities began to
hope that the fire threat near the park's most popular attraction
again was over. ``I would consider it over,'' Bungarz said. ``The
main fire front passed through here. It really fireproofed this
area.''
   Wednesday's evacuation of the geyser complex was the first in
the 116-year history of the oldest U.S. national park, ordered as
the fire burned to within a half-mile of the park's most popular
attraction.
   About 800 visitors calmly left the 320-room inn, which park
officials decided to close for the season more than a month early.
Later, however, park officials decided to allow day visitors in the
area.
   Inside the complex, firefighters hosed down buildings to protect
them from flames as a handful of tourists sightseeing when the
flames erupted, were held in the area until fire activity slowed.
   ``It's the safest place to be in spite of what it feels like,''
Bungarz said.
   ``I've been coming up here a long time,'' said Ken Miller, a
visitor from Denver. ``Thank God I've got a lot of pictures of the
way the park was, because I'll never see it like that again.''
   Bungarz said he expected winds to subside by midnight and
weather to remain calm Thursday and Friday, but he added forecasts
called for a return of high winds by the weekend.
   The National Weather Service said a storm front could bring
significant precipitation to Yellowstone by Sunday or Monday.
Forecaster Mike Oard in Great Falls, Mont., said the storm was
``looking more likely all the time.''
   In Washington, Wyoming's U.S. Sens. Malcolm Wallop and Alan
Simpson asked Interior Secretary Don Hodel to declare their state a
disaster area, eligible for relief because of the forest blazes in
and around Yellowstone.
   The two Republicans also called for the resignation of National
Park Service Director William Penn Mott for his service's policy of
letting naturally-sparked fires burn unless they threaten manmade
structures or people.
   However, in the last month Yellowstone officials have tried to
suppress all new fires, whether caused by man or nature, but
unusually dry conditions and gusting winds thwarted efforts by
thousands of firefighters.
   Fires in the Greater Yellowstone area, which includes nearby
national parks in Montana, have charred close to 1 million acres,
park spokeswoman Marsha Karle said.
   On Yellowstone's northern border, a river of fire flowed within
feet of two small tourist towns, and firefighters hoped winds would
continue to shepherd the Storm Creek fire past Cooke City and
Silver Gate, Mont.
   Nearly 550 firefighters and a fleet of bulldozers were moved to
the Island Park area, across the state line in Idaho, to keep the
North Fork fire from spreading there.
   Forest fires also burned in California, Washington, Idaho and
Utah.
   Officials expected winds of 30 to 40 mph from midday to
midnight, he said.
   Bungarz said the 13 fires in the Greater Yellowstone area had
advanced a total of about 80,000 acres on Tuesday.
   The fires burning in the park, which has a total of 2.2 million
acres, are the worst by far in the park's history. In no year has
the acreage consumed by fire exceeded 30,000 acres, park
naturalists say.
   Elsewhere in the Greater Yellowstone complex:
   _ The 260,000-acre Clover Mist fire made a 10-mile run toward
the east entrance of Yellowstone. Fire information officer Dave
Damron said the fire grew 20,000 acres Tuesday night and endangered
the Pahashka Tepee, which was Buffalo Bill Cody's original hunting
lodge.
   The east and northeast gates to the park were both closed
Wednesday. Two fires in Montana have cut off access to the roads
leading to the northeast entrance.
   _ The 224,600 Mink fire, 15 miles northeast of Moran Junction in
the Teton Wilderness, continued to burn to the northeast near the
boundary of the Bridger-Teton and Shoshone national forests.
   _ The 53,275-acre Huck fire spread to the southeast into the
Teton Wilderness in the Bridger-Teton.
   _ The 22,195-acre Fayette fire, five miles east of Pinedale,
Wyo., continued to burn.
   In Southern California, firefighters extinguished the last in a
series of wildfires that blackened more than 25,000 acres.
   A shift in winds and weather and the use of irrigation systems
spared central Washington's orchard belt from a 30,000-acre fire.
The fire, 50 percent contained on Wednesday, was not expected to be
completely contained before Friday, officials said.
   In Utah, residents of more than 60 canyon homes were allowed to
return home as firefighters neared containment of a 5,600-acre fire
east of Salt Lake City, officials said. Fire bosses hoped to
contain the fire by late Thursday.
   A fire in Idaho's Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho spread from
25,900 acres Monday to 36,780 by Tuesday night.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the coordinating office for
firefighting in the West, said fires this year have charred 3.65
million acres, an area larger than Connecticut. Slightly more than
2 million of the acres are in Alaska. During the last big fire
season, 1985, 2.8 million acres burned. The fire center has called
this the worst fire season in 30 years.

   Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Sting
and other top performers entertained 81,000 people in an eight-hour
concert organized by Amnesty International that mixed music and
politics.
   ``You have the right to be free,'' folk singer Tracy Chapman
told the capacity crowd at Nep Stadium, many of whom came from
across the Soviet bloc for Tuesday night's concert. ``Tell the
government to support your rights.''
   Gabriel, speaking in Hungarian he learned for the concert, urged
Romania to respect the rights of ethnic Hungarians.
   A song by Sting, ``Set Them Free,'' dedicated to children in
South African jails, was especially well received.
   Springsteen, who played for nearly two hours, was joined by
spectators in singing his opening number, ``Born In The U.S.A.''
   The concert was the only Soviet bloc stop on the six-week global
tour, and was unusual because it was sponsored by a Western human
rights group. Western governments and organizations, including
Amnesty International, have accused East bloc countries of rights
violations.
   Spectators included Soviet government spokesman Gennady

   Gov. Mario Cuomo turned into a crimefighter as
he helped police capture a man who allegedly stole tokens from a
subway station.
   ``It happened very, very suddenly,'' Cuomo said after
Wednesday's excitement. ``We joined the chase.''
   Cuomo was in Harlem on his way to a school to promote school
construction legislation when he and two state troopers in his car
spotted police officers chasing a man with a bag of tokens around
his neck.
   Cuomo said his driver, Trooper Mary Ellen Fitzpatrick, tried to
cut the man off with the car. When he kept running, she and Cuomo
hopped out and chased him.
   Fitzpatrick, dressed in a business suit, kicked off her shoes
and ran in her stockings.
   ``I maintain _ she differs with me _ that I beat her down the
block,'' Cuomo joked.
   The man ran into a store, where a police officer stopped him. He
was charged with tampering, larceny and resisting arrest.
   The man had been seen tampering with a turnstile at a subway
station and collecting tokens from passengers, said transit police
spokesman Al O'Leary.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expected 11 percent drop in wheat exports
in 1988-89 will cut into the U.S. share of the world wheat trade,
according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   ``World market share may fall from 43 percent in 1987-88 to
about 40 percent,'' says the department's Economic Research
Service. ``Reduced sales to the Soviet Union are expected to
account for most of the decline in volume.''
   The drought-battered Northern Plains, which produces most of the
spring-planted durum wheat used in spaghetti and other pasta
products, suffered low yields this year. The report said tighter
U.S. durum supplies may result in some market loss in North Africa.
   Some renewed activity in wheat sales resulted from the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, which provides
subsidized sales to selected foreign countries, the report said.
New offerings were made this summer to India, China and Algeria.
   A rise in world grain prices has resulted in a reduction in EEP
subsidies, the report said. The subsidies, or bonuses, are paid to
exporters in the form of government-owned surplus commodities so
the companies can sell wheat at reduced prices to meet foreign
competition.
   Bonus levels have declined, averaging $17.80 per metric ton of
wheat between Aug. 1 and Aug. 22, only about half that of a year
earlier.
   ``The rising export price for wheat and the smaller EEP bonuses
imply that EEP importers are picking up a greater share of the
total cost,'' the report said.
   The European Economic Community, which is expected to produce a
bumper wheat crop this year, is expected to be the major U.S.
competitor in many export markets. However, the EEC was said to
have limited exports through this month due to budget constraints
and relatively tight wheat supplies.
   ``Other major competitors will not have the supplies to compete
effectively with the United States in many markets,'' the report
said. ``Canada's carrying (beginning inventory) stocks are low and
the drought is expected to leave Canada with only 16 million tons
of exportable supplies. Canada's exports at this level would be 32
percent below the 1987-88 record and the lowest since 1979-80.''
   Australia and Argentina were also said to have reduced or
below-average wheat availability for export in the coming year.
   But higher wheat prices are expected to encourage minor
exporters, such as Eastern European countries and Turkey,
particularly for durum wheat, the report said. Primary markets for
these exporters will be North Africa, the Middle East and the
Soviet Union.

   The Environmental Protection Agency says the
two sellers of chlordimeform, a pesticide used on an eighth of the
nation's cotton crop which causes cancer in lab animals, are giving
up their federal licenses for the product and will recall leftovers
from farmers.
   The agency said Wednesday it would make the distribution or use
of the chemical, used to destroy the eggs and larvae of the tobacco
budworm and the cotton bollworm, illegal after Feb. 19.
   Pesticide recalls are rare, and a spokesman for one of the
companies, Ciba-Geigy Corp., said in Greensboro, N.C., he could
recall none that took products back from farmers.
   Recalls will begin in four or five weeks, after use for the
current growing season is over, said the spokesman, Steve Powell.
Farmers will receive refunds for unused amounts and reimbursement
for any shipping expenses.
   ``It's our hope'' that little will be left over, he said.
   The other license holder is Nor-Am Chemical Co. of Wilmington,
Del. Powell said he did not know whether Nor-Am bought its product
from Ciba-Geigy or manufactured its own. At Nor-Am, spokesmen who
could discuss chlordimeform were not immediately available.
   Ciba-Geigy has sold chlordimeform under the trade name Galecron,
while Nor-Am sold it under the name Fundal. About a million pounds
annually had been used in recent years.

   Private exporters have sold the Soviet Union
an additional 300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery during
the coming year, says the Agriculture Department.
   More than 2 million tons of corn have been sold in the last
week, according to USDA announcements. All have been for delivery
in the 1988-89 which began on Sept. 1.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of
corn would be about 11.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.72 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale, announced Wednesday, could have a farm value of around $32
million.
   As with the other recent sales, no indication was given whether
the new sales of corn would count under the current long-term grain
supply agreement between the two countries or be carried forward
separately in case a new pact is forthcoming.
   The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and
negotiators are trying to work out a new one, or at least an
extension of the current agreement, to take effect Oct. 1.

   An 84-year-old woman attacked in a
church confessional by the ``ski mask rapist'' retold her ordeal in
court but was unable to identify the man accused of sexually
assaulting her.
   Two other victims also testified at a preliminary hearing for
27-year-old George Anthony Sanchez. Sanchez is charged with 124
counts of rape, sexual assault, robbery and burglary against 27
women in the San Jose area over a three-year period ending in
December.
   The Santa Clara Municipal Court hearing, which began Wednesday,
is to determine if there is enough evidence for a trial and is
expected to last up to a month.
   Although the assailant usually wore a ski mask or other facial
covering, two of the women who testified said they caught glimpses
of their attacker, but could not identify Sanchez as the assailant.
   Two of the women identified items found in Sanchez's home as
property that had been stolen from them.
   The 84-year-old woman described in a steady voice how she was
accosted by a man who had asked to use a telephone at a San Jose
church.
   At first, the attacker wore no disguise, but the woman said that
after he forced her into a confessional and left her for about 10
minutes, he returned with a ``black face.''
   ``I was in a trance,'' she said. ``I couldn't think.''
   She said the man brandished a black gun and raped her in the
confessional.
   Prosecutor Alan Nudelman showed her a pellet gun recovered from
Sanchez's home and asked if it was similar to the the one used by
the assailant. ``It could be the same,'' she answered.
   She also identified a red, clutch-type purse and wallet she said
were taken by the assailant. The wallet, which authorities said was
found in Sanchez's home, contained her driver's license and
photographs of her and her husband and other family members.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee OKs Bill To Fight Medical Waste Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disposable medical supplies of the type that
turned up on East Coast beaches this summer would have to carry
identifying marks under a bill passed by a House subcommittee.
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., was
approved Wednesday by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
subcommittee on oceanography.
   It would require creation of Environmental Protection Agency
regulations forcing manufacturers to imprint some identifying mark
on the items to help investigators track the origins of medical
waste that turns up on beaches and shorelines.
   The measure, one of a series of medical waste bills working its
way through Congress, also would impose stiff fines and prison
terms on illegal medical waste dumpers and require the EPA to issue
regulations for generators, haulers and disposers of the infectious
materials.
   ``It's time to end the litter and crack down on polluters,''
Saxton said.
   The original version of Saxton's bill provided maximum penalties
of $100,000 in fines and one year in prison.
   But the subcommittee, meeting on the first day Congress returned
from its August recess, approved an amendment by Rep. Claudine
Schneider, R-R.I., to increase the maximum penalties to $250,000 in
fines and five years in prison.
   Another amendment, by Rep. Robert Davis, R-Mich., would extend
the bill's coverage to the Great Lakes.
   In other action, the subcommittee approved a measure by Rep.
Mike Lowry, D-Wash., to move the U.S. sea boundary from three miles
to 12 miles offshore, a move designed to make it more difficult for
Soviet vessels to detect U.S. submarine movements.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Urban Air Cleanup Efforts May Be Missing Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban air cleanup programs are neglecting
sources of pollution that might be killing trees in rural areas,
according to an environmental researcher.
   By concentrating on efforts to limit emissions of hydrocarbons,
rather than nitrogen oxides, the urban programs could be allowing
nitric acids to form ozone in other areas, said James J. MacKenzie,
one of the authors of a report released today by the World
Resources Institute.
   An official of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gerald
Emisson, said the agency's latest computer models showed no such
result, at least for the Northeast.
   Ozone, which damages the lungs, is believed by many researchers
to be helping to kill high-altitude red spruce in the eastern
United States and several species in West Germany. It is formed
from the reaction in sunlight of volatile hydrocarbons such as
gasoline and the nitrogen oxides emitted in all combustion.
   Quite small concentrations of nitrogen oxides, in contact with
hydrocarbon compounds from trees, can form ozone, according to
research completed within the past year.
   The hydrocarbons from trees, mainly terpene or isoprene, ``in
the presence of almost trace amounts of nitrogen oxides, about 1
part per billion, can produce fairly large amounts of ozone,''
noted a report authored by MacKenzie and institute Vice President
Mohammed T. El-Ashry.
   In trying to bring 68 cities and other areas into compliance
with federal clean air standards for ozone, EPA seeks lower
emissions of compounds such as gasoline. In polluted urban areas,
reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone at first before
eventually reducing it.
   ``All that (nitrogen oxide emitted in urban areas) is going to
go somewhere. It's going to increase ozone in rural areas,''
MacKenzie said in an interview.
   ``I think (EPA's policy) is a mistake. ... In urban areas you
have to reduce both'' hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, he said.
   Emisson, head of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that with computer
models, ``when we have looked at the Northeastern United States on
a very crude scale, we don't see big ozone concentrations taking
place if you don't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative
results do not lead us to say there's a big problem in the
forests.''
   The institute surveyed the latest research on the effects of
ozone and acid rain on crops and forests. Like many other
environmental groups and several proposals in Congress, it called
for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide from
industrial and utility fossil fuel burning, a major precursor of
acid rain, and a 25 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen
oxides, which become nitric acid and increase rainfall acidity.
   Today's typical rural concentrations of ozone are roughly twice
normal background. They probably reduce overall crop yields by 5
percent to 10 percent, resulting in the loss of about $5 billion a
year, the report said.
   Ozone on rural mountain peaks in the east can approach levels
EPA has defined as unhealthy, and the frequent clouds shrouding the
peaks can be 100 times more acidic than rainfall, the report noted.
   The report itself did not examine EPA's urban-air strategies.
   Heavy doses of ozone have long been known to kill trees
directly. The report outlined theories by which the acids and ozone
in combination could be killing trees by leaching out nutrients or
leaving them too ill to resist drought or insects.
   A 1987 scientific paper cited in the report said, ``In the
absence of (man-made nitrogen oxide) emissions, isoprene
contributes little to ozone formation.''
   A simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons still might initially increase ozone in some urban
areas, said Jennifer Logan, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard
University. Emisson agreed, noting that no one knows yet which
cities might reduce nitrogen oxides without increasing ozone
locally.
   ``An approach that helps ozone in urban areas might not do a lot
of good in rural areas,'' Ms. Logan said. ``It's important to
recognize that this is being actively investigated and people are
only beginning to grasp the science,'' but policymakers could find
themselves forced to favor trees or people, she said.
   ``In a lot of the Northeast, it doesn't make a lot of
difference'' to ozone formation whether urban nitrogen oxides are
reduced, ``but if you get into the more forested areas it can make
a difference,'' Ms. Logan said.

<TEXT>
   The stage is set for a showdown over a bill
guaranteeing job-protected leave to new parents, with supporters
urging politicians to ``put your votes where your mouths are'' or
risk being turned out of office.
   ``If politicians truly want to capture women's votes, they must
go beyond pro-family rhetoric and photo opportunities with
children,'' said Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal
Defense Fund. ``It's really quite simple: Put your votes where your
mouths are.''
   Added Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's
Political Caucus: ``We need a response beyond window dressing.''
   The caucus is among more than two dozen women's groups, ranging
from Church Women United to the National Abortion Rights Action
League, mounting an intensive lobbying drive for the Family and
Medical Leave Act. It is scheduled for a House vote next Wednesday.
   The bill has 151 co-sponsors, but only 16 of them are
Republicans. Compromises are being discussed with conservative
lawmakers, many of them southern Democrats, as supporters attempt
to secure a majority for the bill before the floor vote.
   The act would require businesses employing more than 50 people
to offer unpaid job-protected leave of at least 10 weeks to parents
of newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children. At least 15
weeks would have to be available to employees suffering a serious
illness themselves. An ``elder care'' provision would permit leaves
to care for seriously ill parents.
   The elder care section is likely to die either in the House or
later in the Senate, supporters acknowledge, and the bill may
ultimately guarantee workers a single 12-week leave for either
illness or parental responsibilities.
   Lichtman cited several cases that illustrate why the legislation
is needed. She described a baker who lost his job because he took
off a day to be with his daughter during her heart operation; a
postal worker denied a week of unpaid leave after his wife had
twins, and a hospital supply technician who returned from an
approved maternity leave to be told her job was gone.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has endorsed the
family leave bill. The Reagan administration opposes it but one
women's group official said Vice President George Bush, the GOP
nominee, was re-evaluating his position late last week.
   ``We think the Bush campaign is showing some very good signs,''
said Linda Dorian, executive director of the bipartisan National
Federation of Business and Professional Women. ``There is room for
some productive dialogue on this.''
   Small businesses are planning a major lobbying effort next week
against the family leave measure.
   ``What plant closings was to large business, this is to small
business,'' said Mary Tavenner, a founder of the 160-member
Concerned Alliance of Responsible Employers. ``It's even more
dangerous. ... They're telling America's employers, `We don't care
who needs it and who doesn't, this is what you've got to do,
whether or not you can afford it.'''

   The likelihood of injury from a car accident
ranges widely among different car models, but for the most part
safety increases with automobile size, according to an insurance
industry report.
   The report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows
that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records, while
station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection.
   According to the insurance group, the Mercedes-Benz SDL-SEL
sedan, which is equipped with a driver-side airbag, had the best
safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than
the average for all cars. Close behind was the Pontiac Safari
station wagon.
   The least safe car was the 4-door Chevrolet Spectrum which had
injury losses that were 78 percent above average, followed by the
4-door Chevrolet Sprint and 4-door Hyundai Excel, both of which had
losses 67 percent above average, the report said.
   Of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record, nine were
categorized as ``large'' cars including five station wagons and
vans. The Saab 9000 was the only ``mid-size'' car in the top 10
vehicles, ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower
than average.
   The 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in
the small sedan or small sports car category.
   Exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least
protection include another Saab model, the Saab 900, as well as the
Volkswagen Vanagon, the Toyota van, Porsche 944 coupe and Mercedes
Benz 380-560 SL convertible. All are in the ``small'' category but
had better than average injury loss records.
   But except for the Saab 900, all 60 of the ``small'' sedan
models had higher injury losses than average.
   The report by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
industry research group, covered 1985-87 model cars, but spokesmen
said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles
as well.
   ``The loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model
year to another,'' said Brian O'Neill, the institute's president.
   The report said the results were adjusted to take into account
various ``non-vehicle factors'' such as types and ages of drivers
that might be associated with particular vehicles.
   The 2-door Chevrolet Cavalier was the only mid-size car to have
``substantially worse than average'' injury losses _ 36 percent
worse than average for all vehicles.
   All but two of the 35 ``large'' cars, station wagons, vans and
speciality cars had lower than average injury losses. The 4-door
Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Cadillac Fleetwood-Deville were the
exceptions, ranked as average.
   Of the 207 cars and vans included in the study, 40 had safety
records that were characterized as ``substantially better'' than
average, while 32 were ``substantially worse.''

<HEAD>Utility To Pay Record NRC Fine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Philadelphia Electric Co. has decided not to
contest a Nuclear Regulatory Commission fine of $1.25 million for
failing to prevent control room workers from sleeping on duty at
Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom nuclear plant, officials said.
   The fine is the largest ever imposed by the NRC.
   The utility is expected to announce later this week or Monday
that it intends to pay its share of the fine, which amounts to
about $531,000, according to Philadelphia Electric officials who
spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
   Three other utilities in New Jersey and Delaware are liable for
portions of the fine because they are part owners of the plant at
Delta, Pa., near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, according to
Philadelphia Electric, the plant operator.
   The fine was assessed on Aug. 11 ``for failing to detect, report
and deal with inattentive operators, and supervisors who condoned
it.'' Thirty-three present and former Peach Bottom reactor
operators have been fined between $500 and $1,000 by the NRC for
``sleeping and-or other acts of inattention to duty.''
   Last month, the NRC called the levy a ``proposed fine,''
explaining that the utility had 30 days either to admit or deny the
proposed violations. If it admits the allegations, Philadelphia
Electric is required to list any corrective actions.
   Philadelphia Electric spokesman William Jones said Wednesday
that a decision had been made, ``but obviously I'm not at liberty
to say what it is.''
   However, two officials said the company had decided to pay the
fine in the interest of putting the issue behind it and focusing on
getting the plant restarted.
   If it admits the allegations, Jones said, Philadelphia Electric
will be liable for about $531,000, or 42.49 percent of the fine.
That is the percentage share of Peach Bottom held by Philadelphia
Electric, which operates the plant.
   Public Service Electric and Gas Co. of Newark, N.J., also owns
42.49 percent of the plant. Other co-owners are Atlantic Electric
Co. of Atlantic City, N.J., and Delmarva Power and Light Co. of
Wilmington, Del., both with 7.51 percent.
   The Peach Bottom fine is the largest since Congress gave the NRC
authority to issue civil penalties in 1969. But it pales in
comparison to the $100 million that Philadelphia Electric has
already lost because of the cost of purchasing replacement power.
   Peach Bottom, which is capable of producing 1 million kilowatts
of electric power, was ordered shut down by the NRC on March 31,
1987, because operators sleeping on duty were said to pose a safety
threat.
   Since then, Philadelphia Electric has shuffled management at the
plant and ordered reactor operators retrained.

<TEXT>
   The Senate is preparing to act on proposed new
limits on textile, apparel and shoe imports, giving little heed to
complaints that it is reverting to protectionism.
   ``The textile and apparel industries will be extinct in a few
years unless the flooding of our markets is stopped,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., said Wednesday as the Senate voted 68-29 to force
action on the longstanding issue.
   The Senate voted to limit debate, giving opponents of the
proposed restrictions no more than 30 hours to express their
objections. As a result, action on the bill is expected by Friday
at the latest.
   Senate allies of the textile and apparel industries were in
command of the debate at all times. Critics, who say U.S.
manufacturers are exaggerating their problems to win special
treatment, were reduced to giving their adversaries a futile,
daylong tongue-lashing.
   ``You are being absolutely shameless,'' declared Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, who opposes the measure.
   Under the bill, this year's textile and apparel imports would be
frozen at 1987 levels and growth would be limited to 1 percent
annually in succeeding years. Non-rubber footwear imports would be
capped at 1987 levels.
   The president would be authorized to compensate countries hurt
by the restrictions by negotiating tariff cuts.
   Textile-state lawmakers and their free-trade critics butted
heads over just how much the industry is earning.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., told the Senate that before-taxes
earnings of U.S. textile companies zoomed 26 percent last year.
That brought Thurmond rushing to the floor with figures suggesting
a 12 percent drop in profits thus far this year.
   Prospects for the bill remain clouded despite the Senate's
action. The House has passed a differing version and it is unclear
whether compromise can be reached in the month remaining before
lawmakers adjourn. A veto also is a possibility.
   President Reagan vetoed a similar bill in 1985 and the
administration is suggesting that the same fate may await the
latest version.
   A wave of Asian textile and apparel imports jolted U.S.
manufacturers in the early 1980s and they have been seeking
congressional import curbs ever since.
   Textile and apparel companies as well as their allies in the
shoe industry and a variety of labor unions say such restrictions
are needed to salvage jobs in an industry whose very existence they
claim is threatened by foreign competition.
   The Reagan administration and lawmakers from export-minded
states, however, have been pointing to an upturn in textile
industry earnings. They say a steep fall in employment represents a
shakeout traceable largely to increased productivity and efficiency.
   Layoffs came at the same time as a modernization of many U.S.
textile plants with automated equipment. The upgrading came in
large part as a response to increased competition from overseas
manufacturers, mainly in Asia.
   But apparel manufacturing has not been able to automate to
anything near the same extent. As a result, labor-intensive,
low-wage companies in Korea and elsewhere in Asia have enjoyed a
substantial advantage in many cases.

   Vice President George Bush, who stunned
Democrat Michael Dukakis with a barrage of tough attacks on the
presidential campaign trail last month, is trying for a different
image in his opening television ads.
   ``I want a kinder and gentler nation,'' Bush said in his
convention acceptance speech. That moment and others like it are
now being replayed for California audiences in two 30-second spots.
   The ``kinder and gentler'' pitch was designed in large part to
increase Bush's lagging support among women voters. It is being
replayed in an ad called ``The Future,'' in which domestic images
of Bush cooking at the stove, Bush eating at a picnic and Bush
kissing a grandchild are mixed in with excerpts from his speech.
   ``I'm a quiet man but I hear the quiet people others don't. ...
I hear them and I am moved,'' Bush continues.
   ``The president,'' intones a honey-voiced narrator. ``The heart,
the soul, the conscience of the nation.''
   A second Bush ad, also running in California, features another
moment in his acceptance speech. After describing his years serving
``a great president,'' Bush says it all comes down to ``the man at
the desk, and who should sit at that desk.''
   Cheers break out on the convention floor as he declares, ``My
friends, I am that man.'' Scenes of the convention alternate with
shots of the White House, strikingly lit in the dark of night.
   Dukakis is competing with Bush on both the compassion and
competence fronts, mostly in Texas _ like California, another
critical battleground.
   A Dukakis spot running in Texas shows a padlocked plant gate as
a narrator asks, ``Shouldn't there be a law to give you and your
community 60 days' notice? George Bush says no and Dan Quayle led
the fight in the Senate against making it a law.''
   The ad says the Massachusetts governor had one of the first such
laws in the country passed and touts Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, his
running mate, as ``the man who won the fight to make 60-day
notification law.'' The two are shown in their shirtsleeves,
chatting genially with a group of workers at a plant.
   ``Who cares about your life?'' a narrator asks in closing. ``The
choice is clear.''
   Dukakis also has revived an ad called ``New Era,'' which ran in
a limited fashion during the Republican convention and started up
Wednesday on national network television. The spot features
excerpts from his acceptance speech and a list of his
accomplishments as governor.
   Neither campaign is using negative ads yet, but the Democratic
National Committee unveiled one Wednesday and said it would start
airing late this week. Called ``Hey Pal,'' the spot charges that
the GOP is responsible for tripling the federal deficit from $900
billion in 1980 to $2.6 trillion this year. ``We can't afford the
Republicans,'' it concludes.
   The generic ad was scheduled to play in several battleground
states, but the campaign declined to specify which ones.
   A group called Americans for Bush, not associated with the Bush
campaign, has prepared two ads slamming Dukakis' record on crime
and plans to show them on several national cable networks. The ads
were to be shown at a news conference today.

   Here are the cars ranked as having
``substantially better'' and ``substantially worse'' injury loss
records, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
industry research group.
   These vehicles have injury loss records of at least 30 percent
greater or 30 percent less than the average for the 207 vehicles
examined.
   The number in parenthesis after each vehicle represents the
relative injury loss rate. The lower the number the better the loss
rate; 100 is the average for all vehicles. For example, a 40 would
mean a loss rate of 60 percent below average. A 140 would be a loss
rate of 40 percent greater than average.

   It was an ambush.
   More than a dozen youths waited menacingly outside the entrance
in Blacksburg, Va., where, in a few minutes, an older, wealthy man
was expected to emerge.
   Would he give them what they wanted?
   What the fraternity brothers from Sigma Nu at Virginia Tech
wanted, it seems, was a secret handshake. And they wanted it from
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee who
had just addressed a rally at their school.
   More than 40 years ago, Bentsen was the president of his Sigma
Nu chapter at the University of Texas. And the Virginia Tech
students wanted to give him a proper send-off.
   A handful of reporters waited in suspense to see if he
remembered.
   Exactly what he was supposed to remember could not be
determined. A conversation with one of the sweat-shirted frat
members went something like this:
   What does your secret handshake look like?
   ``You can't see it.''
   How will you know when he does it?
   ``We'll know.''
   Do you think he'll remember it?
   ``He'll know.''
   The media watched anxiously as Bentsen emerged. He started
shaking hands, moving toward the gathering between him and his car.
   Suddenly, there was a puzzled look in his face. A moment of
hesitation. Then a smile. And the Sigma Nus cheered. They posed
gleefully for pictures with their older frat brother, who beamed.
   Later, on his campaign plane, Bentsen confirmed what reporters
could not see. He had remembered.
   ``Yes _ thank the Lord,'' he said, with an exaggerated sigh of
relief.
   What was it exactly that he did, he was asked. Bentsen just
smiled _ the secret's good with him.
   Evidently some other secrets are safe as well.
   When a reporter asked for some stories about life back at Sigma
Nu, Bentsen scolded, ``Get back to the back of the plane.''
   Bentsen's wife, B.A., was monitoring that exchange.

   By far the most frequent non-political topic of conversation
among reporters covering the campaigns this year is airplanes.
   Several times campaign jets have been grounded because of
malfunctions and safety concerns, earning planes nicknames such as
``Sky Pig.'' Pilots have been dubbed ``Captain Crash.''
   But when campaigning with Bentsen it's clear he still sees
romance in the air despite surviving a couple of crash landings in
his life.
   In his political rhetoric, Bentsen talks about the Republican
opposition being on ``auto-pilot'' and says America needs to ``set
its sights'' on something, recalling his World War II days as a
bomber pilot.
   After his big Boeing 737 campaign jet was grounded in Jackson,
Miss., last month, Bentsen was forced to travel to Hot Springs,
Ark., in a fleet of three small twin-engine propeller planes.
   Along the way, he reminisced about flying his own small plane
with Lyndon Johnson to retrieve Lady Bird one time when the LBJ
Ranch was flooded. And he recalled how Johnson had forty years ago
campaigned for the Senate by helicopter _ when those craft were so
rare that excited crowds would form at the pulsing sound of the
rotors arriving in town. Johnson would throw his cowboy hat from
the chopper, and then greet the gatherings when he went to retrieve
it.
   Well, modern campaign jets certainly didn't have the same
panache. But what about a fleet of those smaller planes,
barnstorming around the country.
   A Bentsen air force?
   ``We could fly down the runways in formation, and then peel off
one at a time,'' Bentsen said, demonstrating with his hands.

   For four days before Labor Day, Bentsen disappeared from the
campaign trail for some relaxation at a friend's ranch in Wyoming.
   Responding to reporters' questions on his first outing on Labor
Day, Bentsen said he played a lot of tennis, rested, and went
fishing with what he claimed was great success.
   ``Hold up your hand,'' he told a reporter a few rows back on the
plane. She did.
   Bentsen held up his own hand facing hers and declared: ``That's
how big it was.''

<HEAD>Bacteria Found To Pass On Acquired Characteristics To Offspring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bacteria can pass on to their offspring
characteristics they acquire during their lifetimes, according to a
discovery that challenges one of the central tenets of Charles
Darwin's theory of evolution.
   John Cairns and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public
Health in Boston reported today that bacteria threatened with
starvation can size up their troubles and mutate in ways that
enable them to survive.
   Cairns said in a telephone interview that the inheritance of
acquired characteristics can probably occur in other single-celled
organisms like algae and fungi but is unlikely to occur in higher
animals.
   Franklin Stahl, a professor of molecular genetics at the
University of Oregon in Eugene, said of Cairns' finding, ``It will
be very interesting to a lot of biologists. Whether it's important
_ it won't do anything to reduce the national debt.''
   The idea that acquired characteristics could be passed on to
succeeding generations was proposed early in the 19th century by
Jean de Lamarck. But Lamarckism, as the theory was called, was
generally discarded early in this century, said Stahl.
   If Lamarckism is correct, it would mean that a blacksmith, for
example, who developed strong muscles during his lifetime, would be
destined to have children with stronger-than-average muscles, said
Cairns.
   The idea fell out of favor, Cairns said, because biologists
could never explain how changes in muscles could lead to changes in
sperm and eggs _ which would be necessary if the blacksmith's
acquired characteristics were to be passed on to his children.
   Cairns and his colleagues, Julie Overbaugh and Stephan Miller,
report their findings in Nature magazine. In an accompanying
article, Stahl said the job of biologists now is to explain how
bacteria can do this.
   Natural selection, Darwin's theory that stands in opposition to
Lamarckism, says that mutations arise spontaneously in organisms,
and by chance some of those mutations may allow an organism to
survive better than others of its kind.
   Cairns showed that the life-saving mutations in the bacteria he
studied were produced in response to the stressful situation _ they
were not naturally occurring variations that simply turned out to
be advantageous.

<HEAD>Commercial Bank Profits Soaring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profits at the nation's commercial banks are
soaring toward record levels this year after hitting bottom in 1987
when big banks wrote off billions in Third World loans, the
government says.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Wednesday that 13,403
banks reported $10.5 billion in earnings for the six months ending
June 30. That is the biggest six-month profit since the agency
began keeping track in 1934, topping the $9.7 billion in net income
for the second and third quarters of 1985.
   ``We think ... we will see record profits for the year if the
economy continues on its current level,'' said FDIC Chairman L.
William Seidman, whose agency insures commercial bank deposits up
to $100,000.
   The most profitable year for banking was 1985, when the industry
posted earnings of $18.1 billion.
   In the first half of 1987, banks lost $5.4 billion and went on
for the full year to post the weakest earnings since the
Depression, $3.7 billion.
   The poor performance was almost entirely attributable to huge
reserves set aside by the largest banks for expected losses on
loans to Third World countries.
   Banks haven't seen the need to build those reserves further this
year and are thus earning strong profits. They set aside only $916
million on foreign loans in the first six months of this year,
compared with $16.4 billion in the same period a year ago.
   But even as industrywide earnings are climbing, the number of
bank failures also seems certain to set a post-Depression record.
   More than half of the failures have been in Texas, a state still
reeling from the worldwide depression in the oil industry and the
resulting slump in Southwestern real estate prices.
   Texas banks lost $2.9 billion in the first half, with $2.3
billion of that attributable to a single institution: First
RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, which has since been rescued with $4
billion in federal money. Elsewhere in the oil-dependent Southwest,
banks earned modest profits.
   Seidman said he hoped that the condition of banks in Texas would
improve now that so many have been closed or merged with healthier
institutions. At the end of August, 173 banks had failed or
required government assistance to stay open. Ninety-seven of those
_ including 42 First RepublicBank subsidiaries _ were in Texas.
   Seidman said failures would continue at the same rate this year,
setting a post-Depression record, but then decline next year.
   In the Midwest, battered earlier in the decade by farm bank
failures, the profitability of most banks has been restored. In the
first half, just 7 percent of banks in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota lost money,
compared with nearly double that amount a year ago.
   Farm losses caused by this year' drought may check the
improvement in banks in the region, but Seidman said Midwestern
banks should be able to weather any difficulties because they've
lent more carefully than in the past and because of government aid
to farmers.
   Other figures cited by the FDIC include:
   _The number of unprofitable banks has dropped from 2,243 in the
first six months of 1987 to 1,729 this year.
   _Banks on the FDIC's problem list dropped from a peak of 1,601
at midyear 1987 to 1,455 on June 30 of this year.
   _Bad loans, those on which payments are not being made, totaled
$73.4 billion in the second quarter, 3 percent less than a year ago.
   _Bank lending in real estate and to consumers grew at the
expense of traditional commercial loans to business. Much of the
expansion in real estate loans was to build commercial projects
such as offices and shopping centers. Much of the growth in
consumer lending was in home equity loans.
   Seidman also noted that growth in commercial bank deposits
barely matches inflation and is not keeping up with growth in the
economy. Meanwhile, deposits at savings and loan institutions have
grown twice as fast, he said.
   Many insolvent S&Ls, which have not yet been closed by
regulators, are paying high interest rates in order to attract
depositors.

<HEAD>U.N.'s Dilemma: Going Broke, But Holding $7.2 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. officials are caught in a maddening
situation, sitting on a $7.2 billion nest egg they can't touch
while planning to close the world body next month for lack of cash.
   Members countries owe the United Nations $602 million in dues.
Two-thirds of it is owed by the United States, which has been
withholding funds to try to force the world body to implement
fiscal reforms.
   Undersecretary-General Joseph V. Reed, the top U.S. official at
the United Nations, says the organization will be unable to meet
its payroll and other fixed expenses by late October if the United
States doesn't pay some of its $467 million debt.
   Meanwhile, the untouchable pension fund managed by the United
Nations since 1949 has grown to a gross value of $7.2 billion, a
U.N. official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United Nations manages the pension fund for its employees
and those of 16 related agencies such as UNESCO, the World Health
Organization, and the International Labor Organization.
   About 43 percent of the fund is invested in stocks; 34 percent
in bonds; 11 percent in real estate funds, but not in any actual
property; and 12 percent is in short-term investments, said the
official.
   The investments are spread among 27 different currencies in 44
nations, so the U.N. pension fund won't be sapped by currency
fluctuations.
   The fund grew at an average rate of 22.3 percent each year for
five years while riding the stock market boom, a cycle that went
bust last October when the markets crashed. Because of the
diversity of the fund, it lost only about 5 percent of its value in
the crash, the official said.
   About 54,000 participants are paying into the fund, and about
27,000 people are receiving benefits, he said.
   While the pension fund is solvent, the U.N. budget is about to
go bust.
   The United States is assessed one-fourth of the regular U.N.
budget, which in 1988 was $876 million. Congress appropriated $144
million this year toward U.N. dues but Washington has paid only $60
million.
   The United States began withholding a portion of its dues early
in the 1980s due to displeasure over anti-U.S. and anti-Israel
rhetoric in the General Assembly, and to save funds at a time when
the U.S. budget deficit was growing rapidly.
   More recently, funds have been withheld in an effort to force
the United Nations to cut its staff by 15 percent, reduce expenses
and make personnel changes.
   In particular, the United States wants Soviet U.N. staffers
converted from temporary contracts to permanent international civil
servant status, thus making them independent of the Kremlin's
policy goals _ at least in theory.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry has said it will transfer some of
its U.N. staff to the international civil service, but so far none
of its U.N. employees has been reassigned.
   Trimming spending in the U.N.'s regular budget is an ongoing
battle currently being fought in the U.N.'s key budget committee,
the Committee for Programs and Coordination.
   That committee consists of 34 nations, including the United
States and the other large contributors. They began meeting on
Tuesday for two weeks to consider the U.N.'s budgets for 1990 and
1991.
   U.N. officials hope the United States will be satisfied enough
with the proposals presented to the committee to release more than
$100 million in back dues.
   The General Assembly opens Sept. 20, the day after the committee
finishes its work.
   President Reagan may face a chilly reception when he addresses
the General Assembly on Sept. 26 if the United States is still as
deep in arrears, U.N. staff and diplomats say.

   An election-year bookkeeping change pushed by
the Reagan administration will cause official estimates of the U.S.
trade deficit to drop $1.5 billion a month, even though the actual
imbalance won't have changed at all.
   The change is being made two months before a presidential
election in which Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis has repeatedly
attacked soaring trade deficits, calling them examples of failed
Reagan administration economic policies.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner defended the change at a
briefing Wednesday, telling reporters it was not an effort to
manipulate government statistics for political purposes.
   ``It doesn't change the basic story,'' he said. ``Either way the
trade deficit is still large, but it is now improving
substantially.''
   The monthly merchandise trade report due out next week will be
the first to reflect the new accounting procedure.
   It will show that the United States is importing about $1.5
billion less each month even though the total amount of color
televisions, cars and other foreign products purchased by Americans
will not have changed at all.
   Since the official import figure will be on average $1.5 billion
lower, the closely watched monthly trade deficit, the difference
between imports and exports, also will be $1.5 billion lower.
   Since 1979, the government has included the costs paid to
foreigners to ship and insure their products as part of the
country's total import bill.
   Before then, the monthly merchandise trade figures did not
include shipping and insurance costs for imports. These payments
were classified as a service and were added to a quarterly trade
report known as the current account, which reflects U.S.
transactions in both goods and services.
   Former Sen. Russell Long, D-La., sponsored an amendment in 1979
that changed the merchandise trade report to include the insurance
and shipping costs, arguing that without these costs, the monthly
trade report did not properly reflect U.S. obligations to
foreigners.
   The Long amendment prohibited the Commerce Department from
releasing any trade figures stripped of insurance and shipping
costs until 48 hours after release of the initial trade report.
   The government continued to release the lower import figures,
but they received little notice compared to the initial trade
report, with its larger deficit.
   The administration has now changed that process by getting
Congress to approve an amendment removing the 48-hour delay
requirement. The change, which attracted little notice, was part of
the 1,000-page omnibus trade bill.
   Beginning with next Wednesday's release of the July merchandise
trade report, the government will release both sets of import
statistics. Beginning next year, only the trade data minus shipping
costs will be released, Ortner said.
   He said the other figure will still be compiled and will be
available to those who request it.
   Ortner said the new accounting process would put service
payments for shipping and insurance where they belong in the
services category of the current account, the broadest measure of
U.S. trade.
   ``This will give a slightly rosier tint to the numbers, but from
an economists' point of view it makes sense to have exports and
imports on the same basis. I don't object to the method at all,''
said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm.
   But Evans said political motivations almost certainly played a
role in the action.
   ``There were politics involved on both sides. Russell Long
wanted to embarrass the administration with higher trade deficits
and this move is political as well,'' he said. ``If politics didn't
enter in, then they would have waited until next year to introduce
the new system.''
   However, Ortner said that by publishing both import figures, it
would be up to the news media to decide which one to emphasize.
   The merchandise trade deficit for 1987 under the old system was
$170.3 billion. With shipping removed, the deficit would have been
a lower $152.1 billion.
   But that would still be a record, up 10 percent from a $138.3
billion 1986 deficit as calculated with the revised accounting
procedure.

   A 63-year-old real estate broker,
saying she was middle class ``and the middle class always needs
money,'' stepped forward Wednesday to claim a record world lottery
prize of $55 million.
   The winner, Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, said she watched
Saturday's drawing on television and realized then that she had the
winning ticket.
   ``I just kept saying `Oh, my God,'' she told a room packed with
journalists as she was introduced at the offices of the Florida
Lottery Department.
   Ms. Ryan said she didn't know what she'd do with her winnings,
but didn't think that finding things to do with the wealth would be
a problem. ``I've always been middle class and the middle class
always needs money,'' she said.
   The first of 20 annual installments of $2,767,361 _ less 20
percent withheld for the Internal Revenue Service _ is due to be
paid to Ms. Ryan next week. She said she didn't know if she'd quit
her job.
   The native New Yorker, a single woman with no children who said
her hobbies were tennis and music, moved to central Florida in
1975. She said her relatives include a brother and nephews in New
York.
   She said her Wednesday flight to Tallahassee to present the
winning ticket was her first plane ride.
   ``I've had three firsts today,'' she said. ``It has been my
first plane ride. ... No. 2, this is my first press conference. No.
3, this is the first time I've ever won $55 million.''
   It was Ms. Ryan's third winning ticket in Florida's 8-month-old
lottery _ the other two prizes were for $4 each.
   She picked the first six numbers she came across in various
stories on the front page of The Orlando Sentinel last week and
bought the winning ticket Friday at a grocery store in Longwood,
like Winter Springs a suburb of Orlando. The winning combo was 3,
5, 19, 20, 27, and 35.
   ``These numbers were driving me crazy,'' she said. Ms. Ryan said
she had been buying four tickets a week until Florida offered a $23
million jackpot in early August. Since then, she's been buying five
tickets.
   Before Ms. Ryan claimed her prize, several dozen other people
claimed they had the winning ticket. It's not a crime to claim a
winning lottery ticket, but it's a felony to present an altered
lottery ticket for payment.
   One of the claimants was Charles Hill, an elementary school
janitor in the tiny hamlet of Bristol, about 280 miles northwest of
Longwood.
   Hill's claim was enough to get him a $23,000 Chevrolet van with
no cash down, but Wednesday morning in Tallahassee, he submitted
only a photostat copy of a ticket, saying the original had been
damaged in the laundry.
   ``We have denied Mr. Hill's claim based on the fact he does not
have the original of his ticket,'' said a statement by Tom Bell,
general counsel for the Lottery Department. ``The Lottery's
verification procedures on the copy provided by Mr. Hill indicate
that he does not have the winning ticket.''
   It was not immediately clear whether officials would pursue
charges against Hill, based on his submissal of the photostat
lottery ticket. Bell was in a meeting Wednesday afternoon and not
available for comment, his office said.
   Tommy Thomas, owner of a Panama City Chevrolet dealership, said
he let Hill drive away in a brand new mauve van after Liberty
County Sheriff Harrell W. Revell told his credit manager that
Hill's ticket was genuine.
   ``We're sorry for him, but we're not too shook up about it,''
Thomas said Wednesday afternoon upon learning that Hill wasn't a
winner. He said he expects to get the van back, and joked that
``maybe we'll raffle it off.''
   Several dozen people called the department claiming to have the
winning ticket, according to Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The jackpot's final value was put at $55.16 million. Earlier
estimates put the jackpot at $54 million.
   It was the largest single lottery jackpot in the United States.
   Previously, the largest single jackpot in U.S. history was the
$46 million that went to Donald R. Woomer Sr. and Linda K. Despot,
a couple, of Hollidaysburg, Pa., last October. Two individual
ticket-buyers divided a $51.4 million California lottery jackpot in
June.
   Two other large lottery drawings that were held Saturday night
in New York and Illinois totaled $44 million, bringing the night's
take for the three states to nearly $100 million.
   In New York, $23 million winner Anthony Valentino, 29, of Port
Chester said he would quit his job as a truck driver and his wife,
Connie, said, ``I'd like to see Europe. All of Europe.''
   In Illinois, four ticket-buyers split a $21 million jackpot. As
of Wednesday afternoon, only one of the four had come forward.
Lottery officials identified them as the Kole family of Chicago, a
machine operator, her four children and a cousin, who asked
officials not to give out their full names.

   The Senate has voted unanimously to ratify two
international conventions that were prompted largely by the
Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in the Soviet Union.
   The accords, approved by a 97-0 vote Wednesday, were negotiated
under auspices of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency.
   In the wake of the April 1986 Chernobyl accident, Moscow came
under heavy criticism for delaying release of information on the
reactor explosion to the outside world until large amounts of
airborne radioactivity were detected in Sweden.
   Representatives of more than 60 countries met in the summer of
1986 to negotiate the two pacts: the Convention on Early
Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance
in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency.
   The notification convention has been signed by 72 countries,
while the assistance convention has 70 signatories.
   In urging ratification, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the two conventions
``positive international achievements'' that could prove invaluable
in case of another Chernobyl-scale nuclear accident.
   Under the early notification convention, each signatory nation
pledges prompt notification of other affected countries and the
atomic energy agency in case of a nuclear accident that is likely
to result in the spread of radioactivity beyond its borders.
   Information to be provided includes:
   _The time, exact location and nature of the accident.
   _The nuclear facility or activity involved.
   _The assumed or established cause and foreseeable further
development of the accident.
   _Characteristics of the radioactivity released by the accident.
   _Weather conditions.
   _Environmental monitoring and protective measures taken or
planned in the vicinity of the accident.
   The second convention establishes an international legal
framework for assistance by other nations in case it is requested
by the government of a country hit by a major nuclear accident. It
seeks to encourage such help, while not obligating any nation to
provide assistance.

<TEXT>
   The Cabinet voted to cut the pay of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and other top officials because of a
cash shortage caused in part by U.S. economic sanctions.
   A Cabinet resolution passed Tuesday mandates pay cuts of 12.5
percent to 30 percent for Noriega, President Manuel Solis Palma and
heads of state-owned companies.
   The government did not provide the individuals' salaries, but it
said they make more than $3,000 a month.
   Salaries will return to normal ``when public finances allow,'' a
government communique said. It acknowledged a ``deterioration'' in
state income and said the pay cuts will save the government
$230,000 a month.
   Business sources say the size of the economy is about half what
it was in early 1987, before the United States imposed economic
sanctions in an attempt to drive Noriega from power.
   Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces and the real power
behind the civilian government, is reputed to have become
independently wealthy during his military career. He is under U.S.
indictment on drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega denies the drug trafficking charges and says the United
States is trying to undermine the Panamanian government as part of
a plan to renege on the 1977 Panama Canal treaties. Under the
treaties, Washington must cede control of the canal at the turn of
the century.
   The United States on Wednesday marked the 11th anniversary of
the treaties, saying it would respect the accords but that
relations with Panama could improve only with a democratic
government in Panama.
   ``Panamanians and North Americans have worked together to
implement the treaties and to ensure the continued and efficient
operation of the Panama Canal. We promise that this will
continue,'' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
   It said, however, that the U.S. government ``continues believing
that relations between our two peoples will be stronger when
democracy is restored in Panama.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Urges Brazil To End Land-Related Killings, Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 people have died since 1980 in
land disputes in northern Brazil, where landowners hire gunmen to
abuse or kill peasants, Indians, church workers and trade
unionists, Amnesty International said today.
   The London-based human rights group chastised Brazilian
authorities for not enforcing laws to stem the violence and said it
has evidence public servants were themselves involved in some
incidents.
   Land reform is a deeply divisive issue in Brazil, where 4
percent of the population of 141 million own almost half the arable
land.
   Amnesty said the report that although it takes no position on
land issues, it was ``alarmed at systematic and widespread failure
to enforce the rule of law which has led to serious human rights
violations in Brazil.''
   The report accuses authorities of allowing abuses to go
virtually unpunished and speaks of ``overwhelming evidence that the
intimidation and violence of landowners and land speculators is not
only sanctioned, but frequently assisted by state authorities.''
   In an example of official indifference, the report said, a
police chief at Goianesiua police station in Para state allegedly
told one woman whose husband and son were shot dead in October 1987
that he could not register the crime because he had no pen and
paper.
   In addition to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in land
disputes since 1980, hundreds more were tortured or ill-treated and
countless others were forced off their land, the group said.
   It said it sent its report to Brazilian authorities in April and
discussed its concerns with senior federal government officials in
the capital city of Brasilia in June.
   The officials acknowleged state action had been inadequate ``but
did not accept that this called for direct federal intervention,''
Amnesty said.
   The group said evidence suggested most of the killings were
carried out by gunmen hired by landowners to terrorize and evict
those considered a threat to their interests. Most victims were
peasants, native Indians, priests, nuns, church workers, lawyers
and trade unionists, it said.
   The report quotes the Brazilian Bar Association as saying
killings can allegedly be contracted through a ``death syndicate''
with offices in Imperatriz in Maranhao state. It says police are
reported to have been recruited by such syndicates.
   ``Local police treat these killings so lightly that they often
do not bother to register the crimes,'' the report says.
   ``Even when crimes are recorded, police have failed to collect
evidence and ignored routine procedures such as visiting the scene
of the crime and interviewing suspects,'' it says.
   Convictions or punishments were imposed only in two land-related
killings, the report says.
   It says police routinely carry out arbitrary arrests of
peasants, mistreat and sometimes torture them and evict them from
their land illegally, apparently to discourage them from pursuing
political activities.
   It says hired gunmen sometimes accompany police.
   In February 1987, military police are reported to have illegally
rounded up 50 peasants, including children, in the vicinity of Sao
Geraldo do Araguaia, south Para, and marched them at gunpoint to a
landowner's ranch house, Amnesty said.
   ``They are alleged to have raped two women, savagely beaten the
peasants with rifle butts and sticks, compelled some to eat
excrement, thorns and lighted cigarettes and forced bottles down
the throats of others,'' it said. ``None of the peasants returned
to their land afterward.''
   Peasants arrested after gunmen or landowners were killed were
held incommunicado without judicial order and mistreated or even
tortured to obtain confessions or statements that would incriminate
others, Amnesty said.

<HEAD>Poet's Son Denies Wrong Bones Were Reburied in Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of William Butler Yeats says he has the
documentation to disprove a biographer's claim that the poet's
bones are in a pauper's grave in France, not in Yeats' grave in
Ireland.
   English biographer Diana Souhami says Yeats was buried in France
in a mass paupers' grave and that when the bones were dug up for
transfer to Ireland in 1948, there was no way of telling whose
bones they were.
   Michael Yeats accused Ms. Souhami of ``whipping up cheap
publicity out of a great man's death,'' The Irish Times said
Wednesday.
   He called her claims ``the greatest nonsense'' and said, ``It is
absolutely certain that my father is buried in County Sligo. I have
the documentation to prove it,'' the newspaper said.
   Ms. Souhami based her claim Tuesday on a mix-up she said she
found in the papers of Yeats' friend, the painter Hannah Gluck. She
is working on a biography of the painter, who she said tried for
years to convince Yeats' friends of the mistake.
   She cited correspondence between Yeats' friends and the keeper
of the cemetery in Roquebrun, southern France, saying it was
impossible to establish that the remains were the poet's.
   The younger Yeats was quoted as saying when his father died in
1939, the body was not put in a pauper's grave but placed in a
temporary grave, and its transfer to Ireland was delayed by World
War II.
   Nine years later, the poet was exhumed, his bones measured and
the remains placed in a casket for transfer to Drumcliffe, County
Sligo, where he had asked to be buried, Yeats was quoted as saying.
   The Irish Times quoted Yeats as saying his mother oversaw the
whole operation to transfer the bones and that he had documents
from various officials who witnessed the procedure.
   Ms. Souhami said she never sought the kind of publicity to which
Yeats referred, and ``offending people certainly wasn't my
intention.''
   ``I'm sure he (Yeats) believes that story, but unfortunately the
letters among Gluck's papers don't confirm his account,'' she told
The Associated Press. ``Unfortunately I have the letters from the
priest in Roquebrun and letters from the undertakers.''
   She said Hannah Gluck spent years trying to convince Yeats'
friends the wrong bones went to Drumcliffe and that the affair
needed to go into the biography because it illustrated her
obsessive character.

   Michael Milken, who was charged by
a federal lawsuit with insider trading, almost single-handedly
built ``junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporate
raiders during the past dozen years.
   Milken was seen for years as a Wall Street whiz kid, who had
helped transform Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from a minor player
into a powerhouse.
   Even when it became known several months ago that he was under
investigation for insider trading, Milken and Drexel took the
offensive.
   Drexel waged a public-relations blitz, stressing the role of
junk bonds _ notes that are highly risky but offer high yields _ in
helping small companies get off the ground and downplaying their
role megabuck takeover battles.
   The normally secretive Milken, 42, began accepting speaking
engagements and granting some interviews _ with the condition that
questions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
investigation of him were off limits.
   His comments focused almost solely on his latest pet plan _ to
alleviate the Latin American debt crisis by swapping debt for
equity or selling securities backed by those countries' oil and
silver resources.
   Milken reportedly makes $40 million a year as the head of
Drexel's junk-bond operation. That is several times more than the
firm's chairman. Milken's personal fortune has been estimated at
more than $500 million.
   He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high school
sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former
estate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, an
upper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two miles
from his childhood home.
   Milken's fascination with finance dates to his boyhood. At age
10, a favorite pastime was poring over tax returns prepared by his
father, an accountant.
   After studying business at the University of California,
Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone & Co. in Philadelphia as a
junior bond trader.
   Drexel merged with Burnham & Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels
Witter in 1976, and Milken's job was moved to New York. Milken
worked hard to make a name for himself but never became acclimated
to the East.
   In 1977, he persuaded Drexel to let him move the company's
junk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly Hills, just off
swank Rodeo Drive.
   Milken became enormously successful in California, building a
close-knit network of junk-bond investors. He is in charge of the
150 people who work at Drexel's junk-bond operation.
   He still works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week and won't
tolerate lack of drive among those who work for him.
   Associates say they need to make appointments to meet with him
even on weekends.
   He once said he had no hobbies ``because what I do is fun.''

   Here are what some big state lottery winners of the past are
doing now:
   _ Donald R. Woomer Sr., a plastering contractor, and Linda K.
Despot, a bookkeeper, from Hollidaysburg, Pa., won $46 million in
the Pennsylvania Lottery on Oct. 14, 1987. Their attorney, Larry
Lashinsky, says they retired. They garden in their yard, visit
relatives and tend to Ms. Despot's child by her previous marriage.
   ``They really haven't done anything extraordinary or extravagant
by any means,'' Lashinsky said.
   _ Three winners _ 23 people _ shared a $41 million New York
state lottery jackpot on Aug. 21, 1985. Joseph Moore, 39, of
Brooklyn, still works as a computer consultant. Debbie Turcotte,
32, of Troy, a housewife, quit her part-time job as a waitress to
take care of her family.
   Most of the 21 factory workers who shared a third of the prize
still are employed in the machine shop of Hantscho Inc., of Mount
Vernon, N.Y., which makes web offset presses.
   _ Pasquale Consalvo, 60, of New York, won $30.5 million in the
New York lottery on Jan. 18, 1986. He retired from his mason's job
and lives on Staten Island with his family, spending part of the
winter in Florida.
   _ Louis Eisenberg, 62, of Brooklyn won $5 million in the New
York lottery in 1981, and promptly retired from his $225-a-week job
changing light bulbs in Manhattan office buildings. He bought an
ocean-front condo in his native Brooklyn, where he lives with his
wife. He travels widely.
   _ Curtis Sharp, 57, of Newark, N.J., won $5 million in the New
York lottery in 1982 _ he showed up to claim his prize with the
wife he was divorcing as well as his fiance _ but still works as a
supervisor at a New Jersey automobile plant. During the Ethiopia
hunger crisis he organized a food airlift and accompanied the
flight to Africa.
   Sharp and Eisenberg have appeared in New York lottery
advertisements.
   _ Four construction workers who shared $28 million in the Jan.
20 Pennsylvania lottery quit their jobs at IMA Construction in
Mechanicsburg. Three of the winners, Bryan Ferry, 27, of Pine
Grove, his brother, Todd, of Lebanon, and Gerald Walsh, 46, of
Ebervale, no longer are listed in the local telephone directories,
and the fourth winner, Frank Rubinic, of Oberlin, has an unlisted
telephone number and could not be reached.
   _ Two winners _ 49 people _ split a $26 million Pennsylvania
lottery jackpot in 1987. Some of the 20 produce workers in Scranton
and 29 Philadelphia school workers have taken extra trips or
purchased new cars.
   ``We're still working,'' said Marlene Laderman, one of the 29
winning workers at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School. The annual
lottery check for the 29 is $13,818.34 each. ``It was nice winning,
but it's not enough to allow anyone to retire,'' she said.
   At the Joseph Notarianni & Co. produce warehouse in Scranton,
most of the winners are still working at the same jobs, according
to one of the winners, James Hart. Two winners quit after the
drawing to start their own car business.

   A 63-year-old real estate agent who
``always needs money'' randomly picked numbers from the front page
of a newspaper to beat the 14 million-to-1 odds for Florida's
Lotto, winning a U.S. record $55 million.
   Sheelah Ryan, 63, said Wednesday her winning six-number
combination _ 3, 5, 19, 20, 27 and 35 _ was drawn from the first
six numbers she saw in The Orlando Sentinel last week. She then
bought her ticket near her home in central Florida's Winter Springs.
   Twice earlier, Ms. Ryan said she had $4 winners in Florida's
8-month-old lottery. Since then, she bought five tickets each week
but was stunned when she watched Saturday's drawing on television
and realized she was rich.
   ``I just kept saying `Oh, my God!''' she told a room packed with
journalists as she was introduced at the Florida Lottery Department
offices.
   Her first call was to her lawyer. ``She told me not to leave the
house,'' Ms. Ryan said, calling Wednesday a day of firsts.
   ``Today I had my first plane ride. It is not that I'm afraid. I
never had a reason to fly before,'' she said. ``This is my first
press conference. And this is the first time I ever won $55
million.''
   The prize was the largest single lottery jackpot in U.S.
history. The odds of winning were estimated by lottery officials at
14 million to 1.
   Previously, the largest single jackpot was Pennsylvania's $46
million that went to Donald R. Woomer Sr. and Linda K. Despot, a
couple from Hollidaysburg, Pa., last October. Two individual
ticket-buyers divided a $51.4 million California lottery jackpot in
June.
   Publicity from Florida's jackpot spurred a buying frenzy before
Saturday night's drawing here and in Illinois and New York, lottery
officials in those states said.
   Saturday night's prizes in New York and Illinois totaled $44
million, bringing the night's take for the three states to nearly
$100 million.
   The winner of the New York lottery's second largest prize, $23
million, was a 29-year-old truck driver who also presented his
ticket Wednesday, then announced his retirement, kissed his wife
and forecast a rosy future.
   ``Right now we're just going to stick with the simple things,''
said Anthony Valentino of Port Chester. ``Maybe a house, a couple
of cars. Put money away for my son. Maybe another baby. That's
about it.''
   In Illinois, four ticket-buyers split a $21 million jackpot. As
of Wednesday afternoon, only one of the four had come forward.
   Florida's new winner said she didn't know if she'd keep her job
or what she would buy when the state next week hands over the first
installment of $2,767,361 _ minus 20 percent that goes to the
Internal Revenue Service. She will receive 19 other slightly
smaller payments.
   ``I've always been middle class and the middle class always
needs money,'' said the New York native, who moved to Florida in
1975.
   ``I can buy an awful lot of things now,'' said Ms. Ryan, who is
single, has no children but has a brother and nephews in New York.
``I'm overwhelmed.''
   Before Ms. Ryan claimed her prize, dozens of people claimed they
had the winning ticket.
   One claimant, a janitor named Charles Hill, submitted a machine
copy of the purported winning ticket Wednesday, saying the original
had been damaged in the laundry.
   Hill's claim was enough to get him a $23,000 van with no cash
down from a car dealer.
   ``We're sorry for him, but we're not too shook up about it,''
said Tommy Thomas, owner of a Panama City Chevrolet dealership. He
said he expects to get the van back. ``Maybe we'll raffle it off.''

   A difficult and sultry opera aria by
Miss Oklahoma and Miss Louisiana's ``super'' swimsuit helped win
them first honors in preliminary competition at the Miss America
Pageant.
   Lori Lee Kelley, a music student at Oklahoma City University,
sang what she called a ``very tough'' aria Wednesday to win the
talent competition among her group of 17 first-round contestants.
   She won with her rendition of ``Una Voce Poco Fa'' from ``The
Barber of Seville,'' which the 23-year-old soprano said she's
practiced for three years.
   The Clinton, Okla., resident, who called her performance ``very
flirtatious,'' performed in a slinky gown, overlayed with sequined
patterns of gold, bronze and charcoal and a charcoal-colored
feathered flounce.
   ``I praised God. I just left it up to him,'' Miss Kelley said.
   Miss Louisiana Valerie Brossett, a 5-foot-8, 115-pound brunette
from West Monroe, took the first round swimsuit competition in her
group.
   Swimsuit winners often go on to win the Miss America title,
despite continuing criticism of that part of the pageant.
   Miss Brossett wore a white ``supersuit'' designed by Pat Hobson,
a Mississippi pageant official, to enhance the figure. The
supersuits were worn by 11 of 17 first-round competitors.
   The 21-year-old Miss Brossett said she hopes to become a lawyer,
a job in which she said she'll draw on the poise she picks up
modeling her swimsuit.
   ``A lawyer is the kind of person who's got to be ready for any
type of situation. So, I guess I am,'' the Northeast Louisiana
University senior said.
   ``I am physically fit. I feel good about myself,'' she said. ``I
guarantee it's going to help me when I get into that court.''
   Wednesday's competition was the first of three nights of
swimsuit, talent and evening gown rounds among three groups of 17
contestants each. The winners of the preliminary evening gown
competitions are kept secret to heighten the suspense for the
finals.
   In the preliminaries, talent counts for 50 percent, while the
other 50 percent is divided among the swimsuit, evening gown and
interview divisions.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will become finalists
competing on Saturday to succeed Miss America 1988 Kaye Lani Rae
Rafko.

<HEAD>Pope John Paul II Skips Dominant Country in Southern Africa Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the advice of the nation's
bishops, Pope John Paul II will bypass South Africa _ the most
populous and dominant country in southern Africa _ when he begins a
visit to the region Saturday.
   South African Catholics have written to newspapers and their
church, expressing anger and disappointment that the pope is not
stopping in their land. He will visit Zimbabwe, Lesotho,
Mozambique, Botswana and Swaziland, all of which border South
Africa.
   Some South Africa Catholics said they would withhold donations
that would be used to finance the pope's visit to the poorer,
neighboring countries. Others suggested the pope could have done
some good by bringing a message of peace, reconciliation and
respect for human rights to racially divided South Africa.
   The dispute is part of a growing tension between the South
African government and church leaders who actively oppose
apartheid, under which the nation's black majority has no voice in
national affairs.
   No one in the church has said that the itinerary for the Sept.
10-19 visit is a snub of the South African government or a
demonstration of the Vatican's disapproval of apartheid.
   But the Zimbabwe government said John Paul was protesting
apartheid by not going to South Africa. It banned South
African-based foreign journalists from covering the pope in
Zimbabwe.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha's office issued a statement Aug. 4
saying the bishops were to blame for the pope skipping South Africa
because they had not invited him, although they had been told the
government would welcome a visit.
   The Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference said it invited
the pope to come to South Africa in 1982 but has been unable to
arrange a date. The conference said it would be impractical to
squeeze a large country like South Africa into a tour already
covering five nations.
   ``There has been a lot of misunderstanding about the whole
thing,'' said the archbishop of Cape Town, Stephen Naidoo. ``The
pope never said he wouldn't come.''
   He called Botha's Aug. 4 statement ``mischievous.''
   The pope said in July that he would like to visit South Africa
some day but that the bishops told him it would not be appropriate
at this time. He did not elaborate.
   South African security police this week went to the home of
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Cape Town to collect a
recording of his latest sermon. They were investigating whether he
had violated emergency regulations by calling for a boycott of
October municipal elections.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said last week the
government may ``clip the wings'' of activist clergymen who vowed
to begin a civil disobedience campaign against emergency rules.
   The Rev. Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, secretary-general of the Catholic
Bishops Conference, was released from detention last year after
church officials filed court affidavits in which he swore he was
being tortured. He was subsequently charged with possession of a
gun, which he denies.
   The schedule for the pope's 10-day visit includes beatification
of a French missionary in Lesotho, a bishops' conference in
Zimbabwe, and outdoor Masses in Botswana, Swaziland and Mozambique.
   The pope received South African President P.W. Botha at the
Vatican in 1984 and there are plans for him to send greetings
during one of his two flights over the country, on his way to
Lesotho and to Swaziland.
   Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa, and Swaziland is bordered
on three sides by its huge neighbor. Hundreds of thousands of South
Africans, black and white, are expected to cross the border to see
the pope. Many thousands are also expected in Botswana and Zimbabwe.
   Just as South Africa dominates communications, trade,
transportation and politics in the region, its influence will be
felt strongly during the pope's trip.
   South African firms are supplying transportation, food, water
and health services, broadcasting and emergency equipment to be
used on many of the pope's stops.
   Local coordinating committees are selling papal souvenirs
through South African franchises, to defray the expenses of
building podiums for the outdoor rallies, providing accommodations
for dignitaries and pilgrims, and arranging for security and
traffic control.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen,
while share prices closed higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Thursday.
   The dollar, which opened lower at 133.67 yen, moved in a range
of 133.67-134.35 yen and closed at 134.20 yen, down 0.10 yen from
Wednesday's close.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 183.50-point
winner the previous day, earned another 236.10 points, or 0.86
percent, to close at 27,740.11 points.
   ``Investor concern over worldwide higher interest rates and
inflation was wiped off because of sentiment that the U.S. economy
is not expanding that much,'' said Manjiro Ueda of Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest securities firm.
   ``The yen has been regaining its strength and the trading is
getting active again,'' he added.
   In foreign exchange, the lower dollar widely was attributed to
the currency's sharp 1.55-yen decline overnight in the United
States following an announcement from Bank of Japan governor
Satoshi Sumita the previous day.
   At a regular news conference Wednesday, Sumita said he saw no
immediate need for the central bank to change its current economic
policy but was willing to take swift action if the yen declines
further.
   Sumita's remarks raised speculation by traders that monetary
authorities might act to support the yen.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rivers across this flooded nation
receded slightly today, but the change brought little relief to
people still boating and wading through murky waters to get food
and uncontaminated water.
   The death toll from the floods that started June 13 and subsided
only to rise with new vengeance on Aug. 27 was 416 according to the
government, whose count is generally considered low.
   The independent Bengali-language newspaper Khobar today reported
34 new drownings and snake-bite deaths, bringing the unofficial
toll to 1,301.
   The Buriganga and Sitlakhya rivers that wrap around Dhaka on
three sides fell between 1{ to 4 inches in the last 24 hours but
were still as much as 45 inches above flood level, the flood
control center reported.
   About three-fourths of Bangladesh, an impoverished low-lying
nation of 110 million people, remained under water ranging from a
few inches in some areas to at least 10 feet in others.
   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, streets were turned into canals
clogged with boats ferrying people to work, to food markets and
relief centers and to spigots to get drinking water.
   At least half the capital was still under water.
   In the Shaymoli neighborhood in northern Dhaka, two young
seamstresses waded waist deep in front of the four-story building
that houses the small Fairy Fashion Factory where they work.
   ``Eleven of us are living in the factory because our homes are
flooded,'' said 20-year-old Shamima, who uses only one name.
``There has been no electricity for two weeks, so we can't work and
we don't know if we'll be paid, but the owner is bringing us food.''
   She and her friend, 17-year-old Lily, said they waded through
the flood each day to buy about five gallons of drinking water for
31 cents. They said the water proably wasn't pure, but it was all
they could get. ``Most of us have fevers and headaches,'' Lily said.
   Both young women said they had heard about water purification
tablets but weren't using any. ``No one has given us any, and we
don't have enough money to buy any,'' Lily said.
   The government says it is distributing water purification
tablets throughout the country, but they are in short supply.
   A diplomat from a Western nation that has been trying to buy
water tablets for relief distribution reported searching in vain
for sufficient quantities in Bangladesh and nearby countries. The
diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Of more than two dozen people questioned at random in Shaymoli,
only one man _ a pharmacy shopkeeper _ said he was using them.
   The government's health control center reported 16,813 new cases
of diarrhea Wednesday, bringing the total of known cases across the
country to 119,822 since Aug. 27. At least 83 of the afflicted
people died, and their deaths were included in the government's
toll of flood victims.
   The government says at least 25 million people have lost their
homes in the flooding.
   Relief camps have been set up in an effort to help people whose
homes were washed away or are filled with flood water, but many
other people have moved in with relatives, living on rooftops or
camping in makeshift shelters on bits of high ground.
   Abul Hashem, a 50-year-old auto mechanic, has been living for
the past two weeks on the roof of a corrugated tin shed in Dhaka.
He said he tried to find other shelter but relief centers where he
went were full. He and nine other men and boys pitched tents on the
roof of sheds facing their homes.
   ``I couldn't leave my things,'' he said, pointing to his own tin
house where the water reached nearly to the roof. ``There is
nothing important there, but whatever I have is mine and I'm afraid
of robbers.''
   Abul Hashem and others in the neighborhood said robbers came at
night in motorboats and looted abandoned houses and businesses.
Dhaka newspapers also have reported that robbers were operating
from boats, but the government denied there had been an increase in
break-ins.
   Home Minister Abdul Matin said the number of thefts had not
increased, and the only difference was that thieves were now coming
by boat instead of land.

<HEAD>Soviet Group Arrives to Broaden Cultural, Economic Contacts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet and American Eskimos embraced and
chatted excitedly in their native language as a delegation from the
Soviet Far East arrived in this historic gold-mining town to resume
ties broken 40 years ago.
   The Soviets arrived Wednesday aboard the hydrological research
ship Dmitri Laptev, which left the Soviet coastal town of
Provideniya 24 hours earlier for a goodwill trip intended to build
new economic and cultural contacts between the superpowers' most
remote regions.
   ``Not only do you resemble the people of Provideniya, you act
like them,'' Provideniya Mayor Oleg Kulinkin said at a luncheon,
praising Nome for its hospitality.
   ``I arrived, it's just like home. In the first minutes there was
the land, grass, the weather, and most important, friends,'' he
said.
   The visit by the 11-member Soviet delegation and a crowd of
Soviet and foreign journalists came in response to a U.S.
``friendship flight'' in June, when Gov. Steve Cowper led 82 Alaska
Eskimos, politicians and journalists to Provideniya.
   Immediately after the Soviets debarked from tugboat here, one
Soviet Eskimo, Vasily Nanok, spotted distant relatives he first met
in June.
   Members of the group embraced and talked excitedly in their
native language. Several minutes later, they were inside a store
souvenir hunting. One Nome radio station broadcast an elementary
Russian language lesson.
   Officials of both sides said they not only hope to allow regular
contacts among Eskimos, who had been cut off from relatives on
opposite sides of the Bering Strait since 1948. They want to
establish ties that will mean increased trade, tourism and
scientific cooperation.
   ``If you have relatives, you cannot help but know this will turn
out well,'' said Nadezhda Otke, a member of Presidium of the upreme
Soviet, the country's highest executive body. ``This will help
achieve peace on the entire planet.''
   Jim Stimpfle, a Nome businessman who began efforts to improve
relations across the strait 2{ years ago, said he hoped that
``maybe some day our common border will be guarded by friendship
alone.''
   The Soviet delegation flew to Anchorage later, and were greeted
at the airport by Cowper. They will be in Alaska's largest city for
a day before returning to Nome and then back across the strait.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Moscow is seeking to
form joint ventures with Western companies to help modernize the
sluggish Soviet economy. Like Alaska, the Soviet Far East is a
region rich in minerals, but harsh and sparsely populated.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose higher.
   The dollar closed at 134.20 yen, down 0.10 yen from Wednesday's
close. It had opened at 133.67 yen, dipping below the 134-yen level
for the first time since Aug. 29. Trading ranged between
133.67-134.35 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed higher at
27,740.11, gaining another 236.10 points, or 0.86 percent,
following Wednesday's 183.50-point increase.
   Railway-related issues attracted investors in moderate trading
that reached an estimated 850 million shares.
   ``Investors were less concerned about world-wide higher discount
rates and inflation,'' said a stock analyst with Nomura Securities.
``They're now starting to think the United States' economy is not
doing that well, considering the decline of petroleum prices in New
York.''
   Petroleum prices on the futures market Wednesday fell by 55
cents a barrel for the first time in two years.
   The stock market this week has been regaining its strength, the
analyst added, speaing on condition of anonymity.
   On the foreign exchange, the U.S. currency opened lower but
dollar-buying increased later in the afternoon, pushing the dollar
higher, according to an exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``It seems that the dollar has hit its lowest level,'' he said.
``Some institutional investors have already started buying more
dollars.''

   Dennis Conner's country-mile victory in the
first America's Cup race reduced the New Zealand challenger yacht
to a ship of fools, says the tactician for the loser.
   ``We go out on the track and we're treated like fools, because
we go out there and we sail around the track as fast as we could in
our boat and we have a boat ahead of us making a mockery of the
race,'' said Peter Lester, New Zealand's tactician and alternate
helmsman.
   ``I must say I have lost a lot of respect for the Stars &
Stripes organization,'' Lester said at an acrimonious Wednesday
night news conference, shortly after Conner's 60-foot, dual-hulled
catamaran breezed to an 18-minute, 15-second victory over the
Kiwis' monohull challenger in the opening of a best-of-three series.
   The next race is scheduled for Friday. If New Zealand were to
win, the deciding race would be Sunday.
   Lester, New Zealand skipper David Barnes and Bruce Farr,
designer of the 133-foot challenger, claimed Conner, of the San
Diego Yacht Club, held back his arrow-hulled flier by deliberately
sailing the Stars & Stripes catamaran below its potential over the
40-mile windward-leeward course.
   They contended the catamaran should have beaten them by an hour
or more had it been sailed to its potential.
   Asked if he ``dogged it,'' Conner replied, ``I'm sailing a cat.
Somebody else is sailing a dog.''

Western states:

   Fire gutted 17 buildings at Yellowstone National Park's Old
Faithful geyser complex Wednesday. About 200 firefighters protected
other structures, including the historic Old Faithful Inn.
   Overnight visitors to Old Faithful were asked to leave Wednesday
morning in the first-ever evacuation of the most popular tourist
attraction at the 116-year-old park.
   The nearby 165,000-acre North Fork fire is one of 13 major
blazes covering more than 1 million acres in and around Yellowstone.
   East of Yellowstone, Shoshone National Forest officials
evacuated at least 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely
populated area because of rapid growth of the 260,000-acre Clover
Mist fire.

<HEAD>MONTANA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Two men were reported missing west of Glacier National Park
early today as flames raced near their remote home.
   The blaze, discovered Tuesday, expanded to an estimated 7,500
acres by early today and moved into the park. There it burned a
ranger station complex and numerous cabins.
   Four hikers in the park were rescued by helicopter Wednesday
after flames cut off their escape route. More than 100 people were
evacuated because of the blaze, and two park campgrounds were
evacuated and closed.
   Along Yellowstone's northern border, high winds drove a
deliberately set backfire along the northern edge of Cooke City and
nearby Silver Gate. The fire singed the fringes of the Montana
towns but created a buffer zone of charred timber in advance of the
119,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire.
   Elsewhere, winds sent wildfires boiling through timber in the
Bitterroot Range near the Idaho line, northeast of Ovando along the
Continental Divide, and in a wide area to the north and south of
Augusta along the Rocky Mountain Front. Dozens of people were
evacuated from homes in the paths of the blazes.

   A number of fires in the Frank Church-River of No Return
Wilderness reached nearly 60,000 acres. To the north, seven fires
continued to burn out of control in the Nez Perce National Forest,
covering nearly 89,000 acres.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Prime fruit orchards were spared from a raging forest fire in
central Washington state by farmers turning on their irrigation
systems, by a shift in winds and by cooler weather.
   The dampened apple and pear orchards near the Columbia River
town of Entiat helped keep the spreading 32,000-acre fire from all
but one home, which was destroyed.
   About 700 firefighters used bulldozers in an attempt to ring the
fire, while aircraft and helicopters bombed it with water and flame
retardant. The fire is the largest of a half-dozen in Washington
that burned 65,000 acres.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters declared the lightning-caused Teepee Butte fire in
northeastern Oregon under control after it burned nearly 60,000
acres of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon
National Recreation Area over the past two weeks. It was the
state's largest blaze.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>

   Crews set a backfire north of Shelter Cove to protect the
coastal tourist town from a stubborn blaze that swept out of
control over 1,600 acres of the rugged King Mountain Range, about
225 miles north of San Francisco.

   Firefighters contained a 5,400-acre brush fire east of Salt Lake
City, but scrambled to battle seven new fires in the state,

<HEAD>COLORADO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Five wildfires whipped by gusting winds spread rapidly Wednesday
along Colorado's northeastern mountains and foothills, forcing
evacuation of 25 homes north of Golden and an undetermined number

<TEXT>
   Exiled Soviet writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn has
rejected an invitation to join an official Soviet committee
building a monument to the victims of Josef Stalin's rule, The New
York Times reported today.
   The reclusive writer sent a telegram to the monument's
organizing committee on Tuesday declining to join, the newspaper
said.
   Solzhenitsyn's masterwork, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' traces the
history of political repression in the Soviet Union and dwells at
length on the purges and widespread repression during Stalin's
29-year reign.
   The writer, who spent eight years in labor camps under Stalin,
was expelled from the Soviet Union after the publication of the
``Gulag'' trilogy in the West. The 1970 Nobel laureate lives in
Cavendish, Vt.
   The Times said that according to the writer's wife, Natalya, the
cable said: ``To the memory of those who perished in 1918-1956, I
have dedicated `Gulag Archipelago,' for which I was rewarded with
the accusation of treason. It is not possible to pass over this.
Moreover, since I am located outside the country, there is no
possibility of actually participating in its civic life.''
   The range of time Solzhenitsyn mentioned dates to the years of
Vladimir Lenin, who is still venerated in the Soviet Union.
   On Friday, one of the project's organizers, Yuri Samadunov, said
the invitation did not necessarily mean an easing in official
attitudes toward Solzhenitsyn, but was due to the number of Soviet
citizens who think the dissident writer is among those best
qualified to serve on the committee.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Stalin and his legacy
have come in for increasingly severe criticism. In July, the ruling
Communist Party Politburo approved the building of a Moscow
monument to his victims.
   On Aug. 25, a public council was formed to supervise the
construction and maintenance of the monument, as was an executive
committee to submit a blueprint for its design.
   Samadunov, who is on the executive committee, said the members
of the public council were chosen in street polls and from names
submitted by readers to state-run publications.
   Among those selected along with Solzhenitsyn were fellow
dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov, poet
Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Boris Yeltsin, recently ousted as Communist
Party boss in Moscow.

   Hundreds of policemen aided by dogs
searched villages in northern Punjab today for 10 Sikh extremists
who raided a train, murdered 10 passengers and wounded 13 others,
police said.
   The militants, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, surrounded the
train carrying 450 passengers at Rureassal railway station
Wednesday and killed eight Hindus and two Sikh passengers, police
chief Sanjiv Gupta said.
   The train was on a 45-mile journey from the Sikh holy city of
Amritsar to Khemkaran, the last Indian railhead before the frontier
with Pakistan.
   All the victims were commuters who come to Amritsar daily to
work.
   The United News of India and Press Trust of India news agencies
reported 12 people died in the attack. But police confirmed only 10
deaths.
   Witnesses said the killers waited for the train to arrive at the
station at Rureassal, where it makes a brief stop.
   ``As soon as the train stopped, we heard some people shouting,
`Kill them, kill them,''' said Mansa Ram, a passenger who escaped
with bullet wounds on his legs.
   ``They first surrounded the train and fired from outside to stop
passengers from escaping... After few minutes they boarded the last
car and killed the passengers,'' Ram, a Hindu farm worker, said in
Amritsar.
   The killers fled after they were challenged by 10 policemen on
board the train, Gupta said.
   Bali Singh, another witness, said the killers separated Hindu
passengers from Sikhs in the last car and killed eight Hindus by
firing at point-blank range.
   Two Sikh passengers died later after being caught in cross fire
between the extremists and security forces.
   ``There were 35 passengers in the last car, about half Hindus.
We all could have been dead, had the security forces not come in
our rescue,'' said Singh, a Hindu.
   Under government order, trains in Punjab carry security forces
to thwart possible Sikh terrorist attacks.
   Militant Sikhs have been fighting since 1982 for a separate
homeland in Punjab state. More than 1,850 people have died this
year in violence blamed on the militants.
   Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's 800 million people,
allege they are discriminated against by Hindus, who comprise about
80 percent of the population. Sikhs are a majority in Punjab.

<HEAD>Teacher Walkouts Affect Schools In Five States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   About 7,000 striking teachers, many of them demanding bigger pay
raises, continued to disrupt classes for 110,000 students in six
states today.
   Some students returned to school Wednesday in two districts in
Louisiana and Michigan as teachers reached agreements on contracts,
but strikes continued elsewhere in Michigan and in Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio and New Jersey.
   ``We don't want to strike but we are forced to strike. Veteran
teachers earn less than rookie police and firemen. Why?'' said
Lowell, Mass., teacher Coe Kevghas as he picketed in front of the
Rogers School Wednesday.
   In the Cheltenham district in suburban Philadelphia, about 4,000
students missed their opening day of school today because of a
walkout by 325 teachers seeking a top salary of $61,251. The
district has offered a maximum of $60,000.
   Including Cheltenham, strikes by 2,700 teachers in 10
Pennsylvania districts are keeping 43,800 students out of
classrooms.
   Officials in southwest Louisiana's Vermilion Parish agreed
Tuesday night to collective bargaining with the Vermilion
Association of Educators representing 600 teachers, cafeteria
workers and school bus drivers, ending a three-week strike.
   And in Michigan, teachers in Fenton ended a one-day walkout
affecting 2,800 students pending ratification of a three-year
contract. Terms were unavailable. Elsewhere in the state, walkouts
continued in at least nine public school districts, affecting more
than 42,000 students and 2,200 teachers.
   Talks were scheduled to resume today for more than 1,400
professors and academic staff members at Wayne State University in
Detroit, who went on strike Tuesday over union work rules and
salary.
   In Massachusetts, where teacher strikes are illegal, classes
remained canceled today in Lowell and Peabody as walkouts entered
their second day. Peabody's 408 teachers on Tuesday rejected a 17
percent wage increase over three years, holding out for 42 percent.
   ``To sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally
irresponsible,'' said Mayor Peter Torigian. He called a ``teachers'
day'' for today so educators could prepare for classes Friday, but
Peabody Federation of Teachers spokesman David Whitmore said the
teachers planned to continue walking the picket line.
   Lowell's 970 teachers voted unanimously Tuesday to stay off the
job, a move that affected 13,100 students. The teachers are holding
out for raises of 25 percent over three years compared with an
offer of 15 percent over two years.
   The state Labor Relations Commission Wednesday declared
Peabody's strike illegal and ordered teachers back to work, and a
hearing was set for today to determine if the strike by Lowell
teachers is illegal. The move is a routine step designed to set the
contract negotiation process in motion.
   Around Massachusetts, teachers in 35 communities were still
without contracts Wednesday as classes began.
   In Illinois, 60 substitutes replaced striking teachers in Blue
Ridge, allowing schools to open. Negotiators for the teachers and
the school board plan to meet tonight and union President Larry
Swigart said ``the two sides are very close on a salary schedule
for a three-year agreement.''
   Negotiators in Granite City headed for the bargaining table in
the state's only other teachers' strike.
   Granite City's 444 teachers walked off their jobs Tuesday,
idling 8,200 students in the district's 12 schools, which have been
open since Aug. 25. Teachers have rejected a 4 percent pay raise
and are asking for a two-year contract with salary increases of 10
percent each year, Superintendent Gilbert Walmsley said.
   Classes for 1,450 students at Eastern Regional High School in
Voorhees, N.J., were canceled for the second straight day today
because of a strike by about 130 teachers, custodians and clerks,
despite a judge's order Wednesday that workers return to school or
face possible jail sentences.
   In Ohio, contract talks involving 357 striking teachers and
support personnel at five Cleveland schools serving 1,250
handicapped students will resume at the end of the week, school and
union officials said Wednesday.

   Law enforcement agents arrested four people and
seized 183 pounds of nearly pure heroin from Hong Kong, authorities
said.
   The drugs seized Wednesday had a street value in the hundreds of
millions of dollars, authorities said. The drugs were tracked from
Logan International Airport, where they were discovered two weeks
ago, hidden under machine parts, authorities said.
   Federal and local agents trailed the shipment to a commercial
building in south Boston where it was seized, according to a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Officials refused to identify the four arrested Wednesday.
   Ed Callanan, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Boston,
confirmed the amount and quality heroin seized, but refused to
elaborate.
   U.S. Attorney Frank L. MacNamara said he could not comment on
the arrest.
   ``We're doing our best to complete a mission and when I'm able
to comment officially I will do so,'' MacNamara said.

   Australian pop group INXS won five
trophies at the fifth annual MTV Awards for its ``Need You
Tonight-Mediate'' video, and Prince and the British group Squeeze
won two each.
   INXS won best video, best group video, best editing in a video
and best breakthrough video for technical innovation. It also won a
viewer's choice award, voted on by MTV audience during the week by
calling a special telephone number.
   Wednesday night's show with Arsenio Hall as host was broadcast
live on MTV from the Universal Amphitheater and has been sold in
syndication for rebroadcast on non-cable channels.
   INXS, whose ``Need You Tonight'' video includes a rich overlay
of images of the band performing, had the most nominations, eight,
followed by five for former Beatle George Harrison, who was blanked.
   Backstage, INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence said the group,
which formed in Sydney in 1977, does not consider videos first when
writing music.
   ``Videos have nothing to do with music, really,'' said
Hutchence. ``You sit around (saying) `This is my music.' You have a
good time, you make records, and comes the day you start thinking
about what it will look like on film.''
   Prince's clip of a concert performance of ``U Got The Look'' won
best male video and best concert video. The purple master from
Minnesota was in England and did not pick up his trophies.
   Squeeze's ``Hourglass'' video won technical awards for best art
direction and best special effects.
   Suzanne Vega's ``Luka,'' a song about child abuse, won best
female video.
   ``I have known some abused children, and there is a boy named
Luka in my apartment, who is not an abused child, and I used his
name,'' Ms. Vega said of the song.
   Los Lobos' ``La Bamba,'' from the movie of that name about the
short life of 1950s rock star Ritchie Valens, won best video from a
movie.
   ``It wasn't our career, it was someone else's career,'' group
member Conrad Lozano said backstage, referring to Valens. But
Lozano said the group was proud to do the song.
   Rock veterans Pink Floyd's ``Learning to Fly'' won best concept
video. George Michael's ``Father Figure'' won best direction, while
Sting's ``We'll Be Together'' won best cinematography.
   Pop superstar Michael Jackson, whose ``Thriller'' and ``Beat
It'' helped MTV take off when it started in 1983, was given a Video
Vanguard award for career achievement.
   He appeared via satellite from London. Later in the show, sister
Janet's choreography nomination for ``The Pleasure Principle'' beat
Michael's nominations for ``Bad'' and ``The Way You Make Me Feel''
in the category.
   Guns 'n' Roses, a Los Angeles heavy metal band, won best new
artist in a video for its raucous ``Welcome To The Jungle.''
   The award was accepted by group member Slash, accompanied by
former teen porn star Traci Lords.
   The nominees for this year were selected from 644 videos
broadcast on MTV from May 2, 1987, to April 1, 1988. The finalists
were narrowed down by votes from music business professionals,
journalists, agents and artists. A smaller voting body of 1,800
music professionals, technicians and video creators selected the
winners.

<HEAD>Study: Eye Dominance Important in Baseball Skills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball coaches looking for a strategic edge
might want to consider whether their players are left-eyed or
right-eyed, a report published today suggests.
   Just as people prefer to use one hand over the other, they tend
to see from one eye more than the other. If people are both
right-handed and right-eyed, they are said to have uncrossed
eye-hand dominance. But if the favored hand and eye don't match,
they have crossed dominance.
   In a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine, Drs.
Jose M. Portal and Paul E. Romano of the University of Florida
College of Medicine described their study of eye dominance in
baseball.
   The researchers gave eye tests to ordinary people and found that
two-thirds had uncrossed eye-hand dominance. The rest were evenly
split between those with crossed dominance and those who used both
eyes equally.
   However, they found that members of the university's baseball
team were twice as likely to have crossed dominance and 50 percent
more likely to use their eyes equally.
   ``We think crossed dominance may aid the batter,'' the doctors
wrote.
   They found that players with crossed dominance had batting
averages of .310, compared with .250 for those with uncrossed
dominance. However, those who saw equally from both eyes had the
best average at .340.
   ``Since left-handers more frequently have crossed dominance than
right-handers,'' they wrote, ``crossed dominance may also help to
explain the relative preponderance of left-handers in professional
baseball.''
   While players with uncrossed dominance are worse hitters, they
also tend to be better pitchers.
   ``Uncrossed dominance may therefore be a relative handicap to
hitting, forcing those who have it to become pitchers, or it may be
an aid to pitching,'' they wrote.
   The researchers cautioned that people should not try to change
their dominant eye, because this can cause permanent double vision
and other eye problems. And vision dominance may be inherited,
anyway.
   However, they said that if confirmed, their findings might be
used to guide young athletes into the sports specialties that they
are best suited for.
   ``More specifically,'' they wrote, ``since batters with crossed
dominance seem most successful, they could try a crossed-dominant
stance: If right-eyed, bat left-handed, and if left-eyed, bat
right-handed.''

   A former state administrator escaped
bribery charges by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in connection
with a failed attempt to sell potatoes to Honduras that rocked
state politics.
   ``It is time to put our lives back together,'' said Laurence
McMerty, the state Agriculture Department's former marketing
director. ``It has been an awfully emotionally draining affair for
my family.''
   The state agreed to drop bribery charges against McMerty after
he pleaded guilty Wednesday to unlawful compensation for assistance
in a government matter. He faces up to one year in jail and a
$1,000 fine. No date for sentencing was set.
   McMerty, 43, admitted taking $3,200 in cash from William
Messner, a Miami-based middleman in the botched 1986 deal involving
the sale of 4 million pounds of potato seed to a Honduran
cooperative. McMerty claimed the money was reimbursement for
expenses.
   The former administrator had been accused of accepting a
Caribbean cruise and up to $4,000 in cash from Messner, and jury
selection for a bribery trial had started in state district court
Wednesday morning before McMerty agreed to the misdemeanor plea.
   The bribery charges carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison.
   ``I am confident and comfortable justice has been served,''
Deputy Attorney General Bruce Quick said of the plea arrangement.
   The bribery charges were based almost entirely on circumstantial
evidence, Quick said. Some evidence would have indicated McMerty
was ``duped by Messner, at least partially,'' he said. ``I
characterize this case as one of criminal bad judgment.''
   The case is credited with ruining the political career of
Agriculture Commissioner Kent Jones, a Republican who was denied
endorsement for a third term because of the lingering scandal.
   The Honduras deal collapsed after Attorney General Nicholas
Spaeth raised questions about its financing, and the state has
never been paid $104,000 due for the only 400,000-pound potato
shipment that was delivered.
   Jones became embroiled in the controversy when he and the former
president of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota signed a $300,000
note meant to help finance the deal.
   
   Messner later sold the note to a Miami bank for $264,000,
putting $180,000 of the money in his personal bank account to cover
overdrafts, the state has said.
   Messner pleaded guilty July 8 to bribery as part of a plea
agreement that requires him to pay $60,888 in restitution to the
state. Messner, who was placed on probation, was in jail for six
months prior to the plea.

<HEAD>Study Shows Encephalitis Vaccine Is Effective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine is highly effective against an epidemic
form of encephalitis that is a major health problem among children
in parts of Asia, according to a report published today.
   The U.S. Army study tested a vaccine used to control the
Japanese encephalitis virus. Although its primary victims are
school-age children, the virus also affects travelers and military
personnel.
   Encephalitis vaccine has been administered to millions of
children in Japan since the 1960s, but the Army study was the first
to test the effectiveness of the most widely used versions of the
vaccine.
   At $2.30 per dose the vaccine is relatively expensive, and
Japanese encephalitis is still a major health hazard in many parts
of Asia.
   The study was conducted on 65,224 children in northern Thailand,
where the disease strikes 10 to 20 of every 100,000 people. This
rate is similar to polio at its worst in the United States.
   According to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine,
two-thirds of youngsters received two doses of vaccine, while the
rest got dummy shots. The attack rate was 5 per 100,000 in those
getting vaccine and 51 per 100,000 in the comparison group.
   The study directed by Dr. Charles H. Hoke of the Walter Reed
Army Institute of Research in Washington concludes that the vaccine
is safe and effective.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Thomas P. Monath of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta noted that the vaccine is
not available to Americans abroad because of its manufacturer's
concerns about liability.
   However, he said efforts are under way to resolve this issue,
and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing applications
to sell the vaccine in this country.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Link Between Whooping Cough Vaccine and Crib Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies who are vaccinated against whooping cough
face no unusual risk of crib death, as some experts had feared,
according to a major study published today.
   The report was based on a review of 129,834 vaccinated babies.
It found that the risk of crib death is actually lower than usual
after the shots.
   Some research has suggested that babies have an increased risk
of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, immediately after
receiving immunization for whopping cough, also known as pertussis.
Babies are routinely given the so-called DTP vaccine, which
protects them from diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.
   The study by Dr. Marie R. Griffin Vanderbilt University School
of Medicine finds no support for this concern.
   ``We conclude in this large population of children there was no
increase in the risk of SIDS after immunization with the DTP
vaccine,'' they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Doctors generally recommend that children receive five doses of
the vaccine _ three during the first six months, one after the
first birthday and one before starting school.
   Crib death is considered to be the sudden, unexpected death of
an infant or young child when no specific cause of death can be
found. It is most common before the first birthday, accounting for
30 percent of all deaths in the age group.
   The study was based on children born between 1974 and 1984 in
four Tennessee counties. The researchers compared the risk of SIDS
deaths during the first month after vaccination with the risk later
in infancy.
   They found that that during the first week after vaccination,
the risk was less than 20 percent that of later periods.
   ``The most plausible explanation for the decreased rate of SIDS
in the period immediately after immunization is that children may
be immunized when they are in better health and that this healthier
state is associated with a lower risk of SIDS,'' they wrote.

   Soviet scientists are having trouble
communicating with an unmanned spacecraft, and the problem is
jeopardizing a joint U.S.-Soviet study of the sun planned for this
month, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The extent of the problem is unknown but the plan to use the
spacecraft, Phobos 1, in the solar study is considered to be in
jeopardy, the newspaper said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
informed ``that they are having a problem communicating'' with the
spacecraft, said Raymond J. Amorose of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena. The Soviets have not asked for U.S.
assistance, he added.
   Phobos 1, launched July 7 as part of a major Soviet study of
Mars and its moons, was to have worked with NASA's Solar Maximum
spacecraft, which has been orbiting Earth for almost a decade, to
study the sun.
   The two spacecraft were to view the sun at the same time from
different angles, providing the first stereoscopic images of the
sun.
   Such views would allow scientist to study the narrow layer of
hot gases on the sun's surface, research scientist Keith Strong of
Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. said in a recent interview.
   Phobos 1 was expected to reach Mars in January and visit its
moon Phobos in April.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Euro Currencies, Down Against Yen</HEAD>

   The dollar inched up on European markets today
after closing slightly down in Tokyo in what dealers said were
technical fluctuations anticipating the next batch of U.S. economic
data. Gold improved.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 134.20. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 133.80 yen.
   ``It seems that the dollar has hit its lowest level,'' said a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo. ``Some institutional investors have
already started buying more dollars.''
   But a stock analyst with Nomura Securities said: ``Investors
were less concerned about worldwide higher discount rates and
inflation. They're now starting to think the United States' economy
is not doing that well, considering the decline of petroleum prices
in New York.''
   In Frankfurt and Milan, dealers said markets were following the
currency charts and looking ahead to Friday's release of the U.S.
Producer Price Index for August and next week's U.S. current
account balance and trade deficit for July.
   ``There are now more bullish considerations in the market,''
said a dealer in Italy. ``The feeling is that inflation is coming
up again.''
   A Frankfurt trader forecast the dollar would stay between 1.84
and 1.85 West German marks until next week. Another said fears of
central bank intervention would hold dollar below 1.86.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8498 West German marks, up from 1.8435
   _1.5615 Swiss francs, up from 1.5545
   _6.3040 French francs, up from 6.2795
   _2.0852 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0810
   _1,383.25 Italian lire, up from 1,376.50
   _1.2388 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2392
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6980, compared with
$1.7060 Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $427.15 a troy ounce, up
from $426.70 bid late Wednesday. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $428.00.
   ``We're still entrenched in a range between $425 and $430,''
said a London bullion dealer.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428.15, up from $427.50 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 0.32 to close at a bid $430.51.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.57 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.52.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Trustee Concerned About Bakker's Prospects Of Buying
PTL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida middleman arranging overseas
financing for Jim Bakker's $172 million bid to buy back PTL has
been convicted of fraud and has a long criminal record, a
television station reported.
   The report Wednesday night by WBTV in Charlotte comes on the eve
of deadlines today and Friday for Bakker, the leading bidder for
the embattled ministry's assets, to prove he can carry through on
his offer.
   ``(There's) one complication after another, sort of like a soap
opera,'' M.C. ``Red'' Benton, PTL's bankruptcy trustee, said
Wednesday.
   Benton said he was concerned over the report that Louis Pihakis
of Pensacola, Fla., was convicted of fraud and has an extensive
criminal record. Pihakis has been coordinating arrangements with
unidentified Greek businessmen planning to back Bakker's bid,
Bakker attorney James Toms said.
   Benton said he would meet with Bakker today.
   ``I want to find out how he feels this will affect his deal ...
(and hear) just what his alternatives are,'' Benton said.
   Ryan Hovis, Bakker's attorney in Rock Hill, S.C., said Pihakis
should not become the issue in Bakker's bid.
   ``There's no scam here. There's no payment to him. There's
nothing we're risking'' on Pihakis, Hovis said.
   Pihakis has ``never been the man with the money,'' Hovis said.
   Asked whether Pihakis' criminal record casts doubt on the
legitimacy of the transaction, Toms said Wednesday, ``The only way
to tell is to see if the money is there.''
   Earlier this week, Benton extended from Tuesday until today a
deadline for Bakker to present a $3 million downpayment on his
offer and set Friday as a deadline for contractual arrangements to
be worked out.
   Bakker said Tuesday he needed only $100,000 more to reach the $3
million, but Toms said Wednesday night he did not know where
Bakker's total stood.
   Benton faces a Saturday deadline to recommend a buyer for PTL's
assets to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds. The assets include
PTL's Christian theme park, satellite television network and
undeveloped property near Fort Mill, S.C.
   Also Wednesday, Canadian businessman Peter Thomas formally
withdrew his $113 million offer for the ministry's assets, but
asked Benton to reopen the bidding.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987, after admitting having a
sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn. PTL filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code three
months later.
   WBTV said that from 1970 through 1981, Pihakis, who runs
International Financial Consultants in Pensacola, was arrested or
served time for charges including fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy,
forgery, counterfeiting and parole violations.
   The station did not say where it got its information. The report
said Pihakis admitted to the station that he served eight months in
jail during that time on charges he said were trumped-up.
   Pihakis' home telephone number is unlisted and he could not be
reached for comment.
   Toms told The Associated Press in a telephone invterview
Wednesday night that neither Bakker nor his lawyers knew the
identity of the Greek businessmen.
   He said they are relying on the word of longtime Bakker friend
and Chicago businessman Jerry Sinclair, who led Bakker to Pihakis
and has acted as a middleman between them. Toms described Pihakis
as the U.S. representative for the Greek businessmen.
   Sinclair, who declined to say what his business is but was
identified by Toms as a songwriter, told the AP in a telephone
interview from Fort Mill that he was aware that Pihakis had a
criminal record, but he did not know how extensive it was.
   Sinclair said he has had verification, which did not come
through Pihakis, that the Greek financing is forthcoming.
   As long as adverse publicity about Pihakis does not scare away a
Midwest bank that has agreed to handle the Greek funds, the deal
should go through in a matter of days, Sinclair said.

<HEAD>With PM-Bangladesh Floods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of natural disasters
that have hit Asia since June:
   
   FLOODS:
   Aug. 27 _ Floods triggered by annual monsoons claim at least 416
lives in Bangladesh and leave more than 21 million people homeless.
Newspapers claim more than 1,200 people are killed. At one time,
three-fourths of the impoverished nation is under water. Because
wells and pumps are submerged, people begin drinking flood water,
prompting a rise in diarrhea cases.
   
   EARTHQUAKES:
   Aug. 20 _ An earthquake registering 6.5 on the Richter scale
jolts the Himalayan mountains, foothills and plains of India and
Nepal. It is the deadliest temblor in the region in 30 years. At
least 714 people are killed in Nepal and 281 in India. The official
tolls are considered understated because the monsoons cut off roads
to many remote villages. Tens of thousands of homes, mostly of
brick and mud, are destroyed.
   Aug. 6 _ An earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale shakes
Burma, Bangladesh, northern India and parts of Pakistan and
Afghanistan. Four people die in India.
   
   STORMS:
   Aug. 16 _ A storm kills 1,406 people and causes $1.2 billion in
damage to the central Chinese province of Shaanxi. It also triggers
mountain torrents that destroy 3,000 homes, 14,326 acres of
farmland and washes away 165 miles of highway. Officials call it
the most destructive storm in the country's history.
   Sept. 2 _ Landslides caused by torrential rains kill at least 35
people in various parts of Nepal.
   
   HEAT:
   June 4 _ Northern and central India swelter in the worst heat in
20 years, with temperatures climbing as high as 117 degrees for
nearly three weeks. The government says at least 450 people died,
most in the desert state of Rajasthan.

<DATELINE>DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A van carrying a group of Mexicans from
Tijuana to Los Angeles overturned and burst into flames after being
struck by a truck, leaving two dead and 12 others injured,
authorities said.
   The crash occurred Wednesday on Interstate 5 nearly 20 miles
north of San Diego.
   ``The van was apparently moving very slowly and the truck forced
the van into the guard rail,'' said California Highway Patrol
spokeswoman Katie Nielsen.
   The dead and injured were aboard the van, she said. The driver
of the truck fled on foot and was being sought, she added.
   Another spokeswoman who refused to be identified said some
others who were in the van also fled the scene. It was not clear if
the van's driver fled or was a casualty, she added.
   One woman died at the scene from severe burns, Ms. Nielsen said.
Another woman died of burns and trauma at University of California
at San Diego's Medical Center, said a nursing supervisor who
declined to give her name. Twelve others were taken to hospitals
and four were in serious condition with burns, officials said.

<HEAD>Pardon Board Recommends Six-Month Sentence For Escapee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who became a law-abiding shop
owner after escaping from prison 17 years ago on a manslaughter
conviction says he can accept the state's recommendation to send
him back behind bars for six months.
   The state Pardon Board refused Wednesday to recommend immediate
freedom for Henry Staggs of Columbia, Tenn., who fled Louisiana
soon after beginning a 15-year sentence for the 1969 shooting death
of a nightclub bouncer.
   Staggs should serve six months in prison followed by five years
of supervised parole, the board decided after a three-hour hearing
and three hours of deliberations. The final decision rests with
Gov. Buddy Roemer, who is in Japan on an economic development trip.
   Appearing before the board on his 41st birthday, Staggs said
that living as a fugitive while running a business and raising a
family ``inflicted more punishment on myself than the state of
Louisiana could possibly have done.''
   ``That's one of the things that has kept eating at my insides,''
he said. ``I'd be watching a ball game and the police would drive
by or somebody would pull up in the driveway. My stomach would tie
up in a knot.''
   His life as Douglas Gillette, an auto repair shop owner who
enjoyed a reputation as a hard-working, law-abiding family man,
ended on Feb. 5 when FBI agents arrested him at his business in
Columbia.
   Staggs' attorney, Thomas Watson of Nashville, had asked the
board to recommend a pardon or a commutation of the remainder of
the sentence.
   Watson told the board that petitions bearing the names of 2,000
Tennessee residents asking that Staggs be pardoned had been sent to
Louisiana authorities.
   ``There was a Henry Staggs who killed a man 20 years ago and
escaped,'' Watson said. ``Then there's a Doug Gillette. ... It's
almost like they're two separate people.''
   In 1970, Staggs escaped from the Louisiana Correctional and
Industrial School in DeQuincy where he was serving time for the
shooting death of George Ballas, a nightclub bouncer in Port Allen.
   ``I cannot undo what happened the night of Dec. 3, 1969, and I
must live with that nightmare the rest of my life,'' Staggs told
the board. He said he remembered almost nothing of the killing,
blaming it on alcoholism that developed while he served in the U.S.
Army in Korea during the 1960s.
   ``I can live with it,'' Staggs said of the board's decision.
``My family can live with it ... not much compared to 15 years.''
   The decision, announced by Pardon Board Chairman Yvonne G.
Campbell after a three-hour hearing and another three hours of
deliberations by the panel, brought sobs and tears from Staggs'
wife and mother.
   ``I've got to get home. I've got to see my kids,'' Staggs told
reporters. His wife, Bridget, has said she knew nothing of her
husband's past before his arrest.
   Staggs was allowed to remain free on $3,500 bond pending
resolution of the case.
   Authorities in West Baton Rouge Parish, where the killing took
place, opposed the clemency application but no one appeared at the
hearing to ask that Staggs' request be denied. Watson said no
family members of the victim had been located.

<HEAD>Transcript Reveals Crew Knew Jet Was In Trouble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of Delta Flight 1141 exclaimed ``We're
not going to make it!'' 11 seconds before the jet crashed upon
takeoff, a partial transcript of the cockpit voice recording shows.
   The pilots discovered their aircraft was in serious trouble
about 21 seconds before the plane struck the ground, the Dallas
Times Herald reported today.
   The plane crashed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
Aug. 31 while taking off on a flight for Salt Lake City. The Boeing
727 exploded and broke apart upon impact, killing 13 of the 108
people on board. The pilots were injured but survived.
   The partial transcript, obtained Wednesday by the newspaper,
shows that approximately nine seconds after what appeared to be a
normal takeoff, a cockpit alarm indicated the jet was not able to
gather enough speed to stay aloft.
   A second later, Capt. Larry Davis said, ``Something's wrong.
Ohhh.'' One of the final entries on the transcript appears to be a
scream.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said last
week that the cockpit recording indicates there were two compressor
stalls, or disruptions of air flow, one each in two of the engines.
The transcript, however, notes five possible compressor stalls
within six seconds, a set of two followed within seconds by three
more, the newspaper reported.
   After the first two stalls were noted, co-pilot Carey Kirkland
said, ``Engine failure.''
   Just after the three possible stalls were noted, someone in the
cockpit said, ``We got an engine failure.''
   Three seconds later, Davis said, ``We're not gonna make it.''
   At that point, someone attempted to communicate something to the
tower, saying only, ``Eleven-forty one's ...''
   Davis then exclaimed, ``Full power!''
   Kirkland followed with unintelligible words just a fraction of a
second before what is believed to be the sound of impact is heard
on the recording.
   The recording then ends with a possible scream.
   NTSB investigators say they have not been able to determine
whether any compressor stalls actually occurred. The engines are to
be tested at the Pratt & Whitney manufacturing plant in Hartford,
Conn.
   One NTSB investigator, who asked not to be named, told the
newspaper it is possible for engines to experience several quick,
successive stalls.
   Lee Dickinson Jr., a member of the NTSB board, said, ``I don't
know that we can even identify that there were indeed stalls.''
   The significance of the stalls, and more importantly what caused
them, is the key element in the investigation into the cause of the
crash.
   NTSB spokesman Mike Benson declined in Washington to comment on
the partial transcript obtained by the newspaper.
   It will be months before investigators pinpoint the cause of the
crash, but two primary suspects have emerged. They are wing flaps,
desinged to give the plane lift, and engine problems during the
flight.
   However, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that friends of
Davis said he told them the plane suffered an engine failure.
   One friend, M.J. Hamilton, quoted the pilot as saying: ``I had
an engine failure. I put the throttle forward and it wouldn't fly.''
   The transcript reveals that flight engineer Steven Judd and
co-pilot Kirkland went through a standard preparation checklist.
   Kirkland told Judd that the flaps were extended in the correct
position for normal takeoff during the checklist less than a minute
before the plane received permission for takeoff.
   Davis is recuperating in hospital from back and head injuries
suffered in the crash and has not spoken with NTSB investigators
yet. He underwent surgery Tuesday to repair compound fractures in
his cheekbone and has been fitted with a back brace for a broken
vertebra, said Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate.
   Kirkland has told the NTSB he does not remember the crash. Judd
has been interviewed by NTSB investigators. Both men were treated
and released from hospitals for minor injuries.

<HEAD>Man Offers Cocaine, Stolen Clothes To Bail Out Girlfriend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man trying to get his girlfriend out
of jail ended up behind bars himself after trying to use cocaine
and stolen clothing as collateral for her bail, authorities said.
   Wayne High, 33, of Elon College, was charged with drug offenses
and possession of stolen property after a meeting with bail
bondsman Barry Cohen, police said.
   High's girlfriend, Michelle Swann, 26, of Danville, Va., had
been charged with shoplifting $400 worth of dresses from a
department store. Cohen said High called him Sunday about posting
Ms. Swann's $1,000 bond.
   When asked about possible collateral, High took the bondsman to
a car and opened the trunk, Cohen said. Inside were about a dozen
dresses, the price tags still attached.
   ``He told me they stole them from Belk's,'' Cohen said. ``I told
him I don't know anything about clothes. I'll take TVs, cars, but I
don't know clothes.''
   High then produced a foil of white powder from inside the car,
claiming it contained high-grade cocaine, Cohen said.
   The bondsman protested that he knew nothing about cocaine,
either, and would have to get his friend Dave to vouch for the
value of the loot. High lent him a quarter to make the call.
   Dave _ Detective Dave Spagnola _ said, ``As he held up the last
piece, I put the handcuffs on him.''
   Magistrate Bill Hohenwarter set bail at $10,000, explaining that
the sum worked out to $1,000 for each charge and $7,000 ``for being
so stupid,'' according to Cohen.
   Neither High nor Ms. Swann posted bail.
   ``I don't know how we kept a straight face through the whole
thing,'' Cohen added. Afterward, ``even the guy being arrested was
laughing about it.''
   ``We did give him his quarter back,'' Cohen said.

<TEXT>
   A contractor who accidentally drove a piling into
underground power cables while putting in a sidewalk caused the
4{-day blackout downtown, the utility says.
   The contractor had asked for plans showing where the cables
were, but the Seattle City Light maps didn't show the service line
that was hit, said Gerald Garman, assistant superintendent of the
city-owned utility.
   The contractor, Granco of Redmond, was not at fault, Garman said
Wednesday.
   ``Obviously, we're not happy with it,'' Garman said. At the time
the line was installed, he added, ``officials didn't have the data
fetish they have now.''
   Utility engineers are double-checking the accuracy of other
maps, he said.
   The piling struck a live wire and touched off the short circuit
that sparked the Aug. 31 fire in an underground vault and the
50-block blackout, Garman said.
   The fire heavily damaged five of the six feeder cables that
serve the area. Hundreds of buildings were without power through
much of the Labor Day weekend.

<HEAD>Couple Sues Hospital for Allegedly Giving Them The Wrong Infant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple have charged in a lawsuit that a
Florida hospital exchanged their healthy baby for a congenitally
ill one a decade ago to facilitate an adoption.
   Ernest and Regina I. Twigg said blood tests and sophisticated
tissue-testing at a Johns Hopkins University immunogenetics
laboratory in Baltimore prove that the child they raised for nearly
10 years was not theirs.
   The child, Arlena Twigg, died of a congenital heart illness in
August.
   The Twiggs on Wednesday filed a $100 million suit against Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula, Fla., three physicians and a nurse,
accusing them of fraud and negligence.
   The suit charges that the defendants swapped ID bracelets and
altered hospital records to exchange the babies.
   Dr. Ernest Palmer, a family physician from Wauchula who was
named in the suit, said Wednesday, ``I certainly wouldn't switch
babies on anyone, but I guess you can be sued by anyone.''
   Harold Connelly, hospital administrator, said he had no
knowledge of the suit and was surprised by the allegations.
   In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Fla., the
couple alleges that hospital records show their daughter was born
healthy in 1978 with O-positive blood. But before leaving the
hospital, Mrs. Twiggs said the child was diagnosed as having a
severe heart defect that proved fatal.
   Mrs. Twigg said she recalls a nurse telling her that another
woman had given birth at the hospital the same day and intended to
offer the child for adoption.
   ``What else could this be except for a case involving a payment
for delivery of a healthy child as opposed to a baby with a birth
defect?'' said Marvin Ellin, the couple's lawyer.
   ``We're totally devastated,'' said Mrs. Twigg, who lives with
her husband and seven surviving children in Langhorne, Pa. ``Our
lives have turned into a nightmare. We've not only lost our Arlena
... but also where is our own daughter? We're very much interested
in tracking down our own child.''
   The Twiggs said that when Arlena was admitted to a hospital
earlier this year, pre-operative tests showed that her blood type
was B-positive, which would be almost impossible if she were the
child of the Twiggs, both type O.
   More sophisticated tissue-matching tests concluded that the
child was unrelated to the couple, said Ellin.
   Dr. Wilma Bias, who performed the test, declined comment.

   The mother of a black teen-ager who claims she
was raped by a gang of white men offered to tell the family's story
on ``60 Minutes'' but demanded money first, CBS correspondent Mike
Wallace says.
   When CBS refused to pay for the interview, Tawana Brawley and
her family withdrew the offer, Wallace said.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a family spokesman, said Wednesday the
Brawleys were considering ``several six-figure offers'' to tell
what happened to her during the four days in November in which she
has said she was abducted.
   The family has refused to cooperate with authorities
investigating Miss Brawley's claims, accusing law enforcement
officials of orchestrating a racially motivated cover-up.
   Sharpton said that he met several times recently with a ``60
Minutes'' producer and that Glenda Brawley called Wallace last week.
   Mrs. Brawley called Aug. 31, Wallace said, and ``suggested the
time had come for us to talk.'' He said he invited Mrs. Brawley and
her daughter to meet with him to discuss the interviews.
   But, he added, ``Mrs. Brawley thinks that she ought to be able
to make some money from this. ... (She thinks) apparently there's
money in the Brawley story.''
   Wallace said he told Brawley family attorney C. Vernon Mason, `
``Well, there's no money.' ... He immediately said: `Well, under
those circumstances, there's no point in my coming.'''

   Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey has
triggered a controversy in a GOP congressional race by saying that
a woman candidate should not be running because she has two small
children.
   About two dozen supporters of Betty Tamposi denounced Humphrey
outside the Statehouse on Wednesday and characterized his remarks,
made in an interview in Wednesday's The Union Leader of Manchester,
as silly, insulting and irresponsible.
   Mrs. Tamposi, a millionaire officer in her father's real estate
company, is married and has two daughters, ages 22 months and 4.
They are cared for by a nanny.
   State Sen. George Freese said Humphrey ``should be apologizing
to Betty Tamposi for such remarks. They are below-the-belt comments
and a personal attack on Betty's credibility and excellent
reputation.''
   ``I don't retract a word of it,'' Humphrey said. ``It's
self-evident that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in Congress
and have time left over for a child.''
   ``It's difficult enough being a father of a young child and a
member of Congress, as I am,'' said Humphrey, who has a 3-year-old
son. ``For the mother, who in our society is the primary care
giver, working 10-12 hours a day makes it impossible to give the
nurturing the child would need.''
   Clark Dumont, a Tamposi aide, laid the blame on Tamposi's rival,
Chuck Douglas. The two are the front-runners among six candidates
seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacted by GOP
Rep. Judd Gregg.
   ``I have no choice but to look that Senator Humphrey is
supporting candidate Douglas. Certainly there must be some
relationship there. I have to imagine that they are talking,''
Dumont said.
   Dumont said the comments were the lowest attack ``ever
experienced in New Hampshire politics.''
   Douglas denied having anything to do with Humphrey's comments
and defended Tamposi's candidacy.
   ``It's tougher when you have small kids,'' he said. ``That's
true of me or anybody else who has small kids. But that doesn't
mean you can't do the job. I have never said Betty can't serve in
Congress with small kids.''
   However, Douglas said Humphrey ``is entitled to his opinion.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. businesses plan to increase capital
spending by 11.6 percent this year, a fivefold increase over 1987,
the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the increase, if realized, would be
the biggest advance since 1984, when spending shot up 16.6 percent
as American industry recovered from the steep 1981-82 recession.
   The advance would push business investment to expand and
modernize production facilities up to a record high of $429.4
billion, after adjusting for the effects of inflation.
   The boom in capital investment this year has been one of the
main forces driving the economic expansion as businesses have
stepped up investment plans in response to heavy demand.
   The demand is coming in large part from a rebound in U.S.
exports as a decline in the dollar since 1985 has helped
manufacturers regain lost overseas markets.
   The latest estimate of business investment plans is based on an
industry survey conducted over the last two months.
   It represented only a small change from a June report, which
estimated spending would rise 11.9 percent this year. Both the June
and September surveys, however, reflected a substantial increase
from an initial industry projection for a 7.3 percent increase in
investment. That estimate was made at the end of last year.
   In 1987, investment spending rose a modest 2.3 percent after
having fallen 3.9 percent in 1986.
   The weakness in those years was blamed on the soaring U.S. trade
deficit as a flood of imports reduced domestic demand for U.S.
goods at the same time American firms were being priced out of
overseas markets.
   For 1988, manufacturing firms expect to boost spending by 12.5
percent with plants making non-durable goods projecting an increase
of 13.2 percent and companies manufacturing durable goods expecting
an 11.7 percent increase.
   In other sectors, the report predicted an increase of 12.4
percent in capital investment by transportation companies,
including airlines, and a 5.5 percent advance in the mining
industry. This sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, had
seen investment plummet 32 percent in 1986 and a further 2 percent
in 1987 as oil companies cut back on exploration in the face of
declining oil prices.
   Before removing the effects of inflation, business investment is
projected to rise by 10.6 percent this year to $430.9 billion,
following an increase of 2.7 percent in 1987.

<HEAD>Warnings As War Heats Up On Pakistan-Afghan Border</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shooting down of an Afghan air
force jet by Pakistani fighter pilots over Pakistan has fueled a
growing dispute between the two countries.
   Pakistani defense officials said the Afghan plane was on a
bombing raid and that it was the third time Soviet-built aircraft
with Afghan markings have bombed Pakistani territory in the past
week.
   The Kabul government has denied the accusations and accused
Pakistan of sending a reconnaissance plane over its territory.
   Pakistani officials said today they still did not know the fate
or nationality of the pilot who apparently ejected when a Pakistan
Air Force F-16 shot him down Wednesday near Nawagai, about 12 miles
from the Afghan border.
   The Defense Ministry said four planes, believed to be MiG-23s,
were intercepted by a Pakistani air patrol after they had bombed
two locations across the border, injuring 12 people.
   Afghan planes, which in the past have only darted over the
border to bomb Afghan rebel and refugee camps, struck more than 30
miles into Pakistani territory on Sept. 1 and 5.
   The Foreign Ministry lodged strong protests, telling Kabul
``that if such attacks do not cease the entire responsibility for
the serious consequences will rest on the Kabul authorities.''
   Afghanistan's Marxist government called the Pakistani
allegations ``lies.''
   Kabul's Foreign Ministry countered on Wednesday by claiming that
a Pakistani Air Force jet had ``intruded into Afghan airspace and
carried out a reconnaissance flight.''
   At least four Afghan or Soviet aircraft have been shot down over
Pakistani territory since Moslem insurgents began battling the
government in 1978.
   On Aug. 4, Pakistan shot down an intruding Soviet Su-25
fighter-bomber near the border. The Soviet pilot was handed over to
his embassy in Islamabad on Aug. 17.
   Defense Minister Mahmood Haroon told the Senate on Wednesday
that Pakistan still was seeking to acquire a sophisticated airborne
early warning radar system to protect its rugged frontier region
where ground-based radar is blinded by high mountain peaks.
   Islamabad has approached Washington about two different air
platform systems but has not filed a formal request.
   U.S. government officials reportedly have stalled Pakistan for
fear the systems might escalate tensions with Afghanistan on the
west and India to the east.
   Moscow and Kabul accuse Pakistan of violating the April 14
Soviet pullout accord by continuing to supply the rebels with
mainly American arms. But under the pact, the superpowers tacitly
agreed to continue aiding their respective sides until one of them
stops.
   The result has been an escalation of guerrilla attacks as the
Soviets turn the war increasingly over to Afghanistan's demoralized
army.
   September's bold air strikes appear to be testing Islamabad's
resolve following the death last month of the guerrilla's sponsor,
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   Meanwhile, in Nicosia, Cyprus, the United Nations mediator for
Afghanistan reported today that more than half the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan have pulled out and the
withdrawal is proceeding ``in a very satisfactory manner.''
   The envoy, Diego Cordovez, told reporters during the non-aligned
movement's foreign ministers conference, that about 80 percent of
Afghan territory ``has no foreign troops any more.''
   But he added that the Soviet withdrawal has not yet resulted in
``any significant return'' of the millions of Afghan refugees who
fled to neighboring countries during the nine-year Soviet
occupation.

   An infant less than two hours old was found
in a drainage ditch by boys taking a shortcut to school, police
said.
   ``I think the baby's life was in danger,'' said police
spokeswoman Mary Schumacher. ``We were lucky the boys found her
because she was in a secluded ditch off the roadway.''
   The 5-pound, 2{-ounce girl was listed in fair condition at AMI
Presbyterian Aurora Hospital. Officials said she suffered from
exposure and abrasions on her feet but will be fine.
   Six boys were on their way to Sable Elementary School on
Wednesday when they found the unclothed infant on a bath towel
covered with birth fluid, her umbilical cord still attached,
authorities said.
   The boys summoned the school's health professional, Linda Hicks.
``She seemed to be in good condition, other than she was very
cold,'' Hicks said. ``Her limbs were kind of blue and her face was
pale.''
   Dr. Lee Thompson estimated the infant was no more than 2 hours
old and said she appeared to be a full-term baby.
   Police called area hospitals and schools in an attempt to find
the mother.
   Peter D. Gonzalez, 9, one of the fourth-graders who found the
baby, said the boys thought the newborn was a doll at first. ``Then
it moved,'' he said. ``I thought, `How could somebody throw away a
baby in a gutter like that?' ''

<HEAD>Former Police Captain Sentenced In Sex Abuse Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police captain who had himself
castrated in a bid for leniency has been sentenced to 15 years in
prison for having sex with boys.
   Sidney Elijah Pourciau, 62, pleaded guilty in April to
aggravated crime against nature in cases involving four boys.
   Judge Mike Ponder sentenced Pourciau on Wednesday to the maximum
of 15 years on each of four counts and ordered the terms to be
served concurrently.
   Pourciau, who retired in 1985 after 32 years on the Baton Rouge
force, was arrested in 1986 after a parent of an 11-year-old
neighbor complained of sexual abuse. The assaults on boys in the
neighborhood began in 1981, police said.
   Pourciau voluntarily underwent castration in an effort to solve
his sexual problem, a defense attorney said.
   After pronouncing sentence, the judge told Pourciau, ``I think
you've made a sincere effort to rehabilitate yourself from this
problem, this sickness, you have.''

<TEXT>
   A woman has pleaded guilty to helping her
boyfriend rape her teen-age daughter so the girl could bear the
child the mother could not.
   In a rare case of a woman charged with rape, the 38-year-old
mother pleaded guilty last week to attempted rape, admitting her
role in the 1986 attack on her 14-year-old daughter.
   The mother wanted another baby but was unable to bear children,
so she attempted to have her 31-year-old boyfriend get her daughter
pregnant, the daughter told police.
   The boyfriend threatened to beat the girl's mother if the
teen-ager refused to have sex with him, the girl said in an
affidavit. The boyfriend slapped the mother in front of the girl,
and the mother watched the sexual attack, the girl said.
   The rape was not reported until a year later, after the girl
gave birth to a boy and social services authorities intervened.
   Social workers had sued the boyfriend for child support, and the
girl's mother sought custody of the baby, Assistant District
Attorney Kathleen Dougherty said.
   But lab tests showed that the boyfriend was not the baby's
father, Dougherty said. The father was the girl's own boyfriend,
she said.
   The woman, who was indicted in April on a charge of rape,
pleaded guilty Sept. 1 to the reduced charge. Judge Patrick J.
Cunningham said he would sentence her to probation Oct. 19,
according to her lawyer, Steven Paquette.
   The woman's boyfriend pleaded guilty to rape Aug. 15. Cunningham
said he will sentence him to no more than a year in jail on Sept.
26.
   The identities of those involved in the case have not been
released.

   Israeli troops opened fire today on a gang of
masked Palestinians who had ambushed their patrol with knives and
clubs, killing one assailant and seriously wounding another, the
army said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, troops shot and wounded
seven Palestinians, including four teen-agers and two 9-year-old
girls, Arab hospital officials said.
   A general strike was observed in the occupied lands to mark the
nine-month anniversary of the Palestinian uprising. Called by
pro-PLO underground leaders of the revolt, it was viewed as a key
test of their control in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A rival underground group, the Moslem fundamentalist ``Hamas,''
called the anniversary strike for Friday, underscoring a growing
split in the uprising leadership.
   In Nablus, 14 Palestinians pleaded innocent today to charges of
taking part in a stone-throwing protest that resulted in the death
of a 15-year-old Jewish girl April 6.
   The defendants are among 20 charged in the death of Tirza Porat,
the first Israeli civilian killed in the uprising. Five Israelis
and 260 Palestinians have died since the unrest began Dec. 8.
   Yaffa Rothchild, the attorney for the defendants, said six of
the youths did not appear because military authorities had moved
them from the Nablus jail and were unable to locate them for the
hearing.
   Miss Porat was killed when a group of Jewish settlers she was
hiking with confronted Palestinians near the village of Beita,
three miles south of Nablus, and then walked into the village. The
army and Arab villagers contend Miss Porat was accidentally shot by
one of the Israelis.
   A political dispute broke out over a U.S. invitation to Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres to attend a Middle East peace meeting in
Washington Sept. 25.
   That will be a month before Israel's election, which pits Peres'
Labor Party against Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc. President Reagan will host the meeting between Peres,
who supports a U.S. peace plan, and Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel
Meguid of Egypt.
   Shamir, who opposes parts of the U.S. plan, accused Peres of
engineering the invitation to influence the Nov. 1 Israeli
parliamentary election, which both he and Peres have billed as a
historic referendum on how to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``The whole thing is so obvious. It's an election gimmick,''
Likud member Yitzhak Modai told Israel army radio. ``It is
unacceptable in the democratic world to involve foreign factors in
domestic elections.''
   Peres dismissed the charges, saying he accepted the U.S.
invitation to keep the Middle East peace initiative ``alive and
well.''
   Today's fatality occured in the village of Silat Al Harathiya,
in the West Bank's northernmost corner about 55 miles from
Jerusalem.
   Palestinian witnesses said the clash broke out when a gang of
masked Arabs trying to stop Arab workers from going to jobs in
Israel turned on an army patrol and attacked troops with stones,
knives and clubs.
   Hospital officials identified the dead man as Mohammed Ahmed
Abdullah Abu Salah, 36, and said he was shot in the head. A
21-year-old man was in serious condition with gunshot wounds to the
abdomen and legs, the officials said.
   The death brought to 260 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising.
   Today's PLO-ordered general strike was observed throughout the
West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, a stronghold of the rival Moslem
fundamentalist Hamas, which means ``zeal'' in Arabic.
   In Gaza City, however, graffiti scrawled across walls in red
paint called on residents to observe the strike called by Hamas for
Friday. Some of the messages were painted over pro-PLO slogans.

   Showered with confetti by anti-nuclear
campaigners, the first U.S. cruise missiles to leave Western Europe
under the superpower arms control treaty were flown out of Britain
today, less than a year after they arrived.
   ``Good riddance, don't come back!'' shouted the protesters
outside the U.S. air base at Molesworth, 50 miles north of London,
as two of the 18 cruise missiles, the most recent to be deployed in
Britain, were driven away aboard camouflaged mobile launchers.
   The vehicles headed to the nearby base at Alconbury, where the
missiles were put aboard a C141 aircraft and the launchers aboard a
Galaxy C5.
   The two giant transport planes took off at 2 p.m. (9 a.m. EDT)
for a 12-hour non-stop flight, with midair refueling, to Davis
Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona for destruction under Soviet
supervision.
   The small group of anti-nuclear campaigners watched the missiles
on board two 55-foot transporters lumber through the gates and
across the flat Cambridgeshire countryside for the last time. The
protesters carried banners saying: ``This is only the first step.''
   ``This is something we have been working for for nine years,''
said Meg Beresford, secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament.
   At Molesworth, U.S Ambassador to Britain Charles H. Price II
hailed the missile departure as an achievement for the unity of the
16-nation NATO alliance. Referring to the protesters, said: ``We
are not here because some individuals, well-intentioned and
innocent of the world's realities, kept vigils at our bases.''
   The credit ``also belongs in part to (Soviet leader) Mikhail
Gorbachev, who bargained in good faith to accept the wisdom of
President Reagan's zero-option and acted upon it,'' said Price.
   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the agreement in Washington last
Dec. 8.
   British Defense Secretary George Younger said the missiles
treaty was a ``stinging rebuke'' to the protesters.
   ``The Russians must show that they are prepared to change in a
very real way their offensive military posture,'' Younger said.
``There is, I regret to say, no sign of them doing this so far.''
   Younger did not rule out speculation that Molesworth, built at a
cost of $76.5 million specifically to take 64 missiles, may be
equipped with runways for the U.S. Air Force to deploy
nuclear-capable F-111 bombers.
   Younger said no new land-based weapons would be introduced.
   Missile deployment at Molesworth began last November, four years
after the first U.S. cruise missiles deployed in Europe arrived at
Greenham Common, another U.S. air base in Britain.
   No date has been set for the removal of 96 cruise missiles at
Greenham.
   Officials said all Molesworth's missiles would be gone in three
months.
   The Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, ratified by the Senate
in June, set a 1991 deadline for the superpowers to eliminate their
2,700 land-based missiles from Europe. The missiles have a range of
about 300 to 3,000 miles.
   The first U.S. missiles to leave Western Europe under the
agreement were nine Pershing 2 medium-range weapons, removed Sept.
1 from a base near Stuttgart, West Germany.
   The Soviet Union began removing its medium-range missiles from
Czechoslovakia and East Germany in February.

   Tropical Storm Florence today hovered off the
Yucatan Peninsula in the southern Gulf of Mexico, and forecasters
warned that it could strengthen to a hurricane within the next two
days.
   Day-old Florence, with wind of 55 mph, swirled about 120 miles
north of Merida, Mexico, near latitude 22.8 north and longtitude
89.7 west, according to a 6 a.m. EDT advisory from the National
Hurricane Center.
   ``It has weak steering currents and has moved very little from
where it originally formed,'' said forecaster Miles Lawrence. ``But
it's over warm water and stands a very good chance of developing
into a hurricane.''
   For Florence to strengthen to a hurricane, its sustained wind
would have to reach 74 mph, and that could happen within 48 hours,
Lawrence said.
   ``The only current threat would be to marine interests,''
forecaster Noel Risynchok said. ``It's out in the open waters of
the gulf.''
   Florence is the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season. Only Debby, which struck Mexico's Gulf Coast, reached
hurricane status.

<TEXT>
   A well-known Soviet historian says Leonid I.
Brezhnev suffered ``clinical death'' in 1976 and was so weakened
for the last six years of his rule that it wa difficult for him to
perform simple duties or understand what was going on around him.
   Roy Medvedev, in an article published in this week's edition of
the Moscow News, painted a picture of a leader in such bad health
that his aides took over most of his functions.
   ``Brezhnev had the first serious problems with his health in
1969-1970,'' Medvedev wrote. ``At the beginning of 1976, he had a
clinical death. Doctors managed to revive him, but for the next
three months he couldn't work, as his speech and abilities to think
were impaired.''
   The Brezhnev era has been under increasing attack lately.
   The Moscow News article appeared at the same time Brezhnev's
son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, and eight co-defendants went on trial
faced with several charges involving corruption and bribery.
   Medvedev, a frequent commentator on Soviet history, also said
Brezhnev possessed no outstanding characteristics and was pushed
into the country's top leadership job.
   Medvedev is the author of ``Let History Judge,'' a celebrated
indictment of Josef Stalin's rule. He was expelled from the
Communist Party after a letter he wrote appeared in an emigre
journal. With his brother Zhores, who lives in London, he also has
written a piercing criticism of Stalin's successor, Nikita S.
Khrushchev.
   Although he never challenged the authority of the Communist
Party, Medvedev was on the outs with officials during the Brezhnev
period. State-owned publications began printing his works just this
year under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness.
   In the six years before his death on Nov. 10, 1982, Medvedev
said, Brezhnev was constantly attended by a group of doctors.
   ``They were always on duty. At those places where he used to
stay, there were specially equipped medical laboratories,'' the
historian said in the article.
   Medvedev said Brezhnev's working day was cut to a few hours
after his brush with death and his vacations expanded from one to
two annually.
   ``The state of health of our leaders is not a topic dicussed in
the press, but his (Brezhnev's) progressing illness was evident to
everyone who saw him on television,'' the article said.
   ``Naturally, Brezhnev's illness affected his abilities to rule
the country. He often interrupted fulfillment of his duties and let
his personal aides take over,'' the article said.
   Medvedev said the public eventually lost respect for Brezhnev
because of occasional public appearances during which the leader
had to be supported under each arm. The historian blamed ``many
influential and corrupted people from his close circle'' for the
public's loss of confidence in their leader.
   ``They managed to achieve the worst,'' Medvedev said. ``Namely
that the old age and illness of a Soviet leader became an object
not of sympathy among citizens, but of open ridicule and
irritation.''
   Brezhnev was plagued with health problems for the final 12 years
of his rule, but even as a younger, healthier man he lacked
outstanding qualities, Medvedev wrote.
   ``Brezhnev was not a great or even outstanding man. If I were
asked to characterize him in a few words, I would say he was weak
in almost all spheres of his personality,'' Medvedev said.

<HEAD>South Korea Urged to Release Prisoners, Change Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea is improving its human rights record
but holds about 600 political prisoners, and torture still occurs,
Amnesty International said today.
   The international human rights group urged the Seoul government
to make further improvements. It called for the release of
political prisoners, an end to torture and other ill-treatment of
detainees and changes in laws to allow peaceful expression of
opposition to the government.
   The report comes a week before the opening of the Olympic Games
in Seoul.
   In a report called ``Detention of Prisoners of Conscience and
Torture Continue,'' Amnesty International noted that major
political changes since last summer have ushered in some
improvements in the human rights area.
   The government of President Roh Tae-woo came into power after
Roh, then chairman of the ruling party, pledged a package of
democratic reforms, including release of political prisoners, in
response to violent demonstrations in June 1987.
   ``There have been releases and amnesties, but we think they've
been too few,'' the group said.
   While the government says nearly 1,300 political prisoners have
been released since last year, Amnesty International claims the
number is 400. The human rights group also said 4,000 former
political prisoners' civil rights have been restored in this
period, about half the number claimed by the government.
   The report said ``arrests on political grounds have continued,''
with about 600 people imprisoned for political or trade union
activities.
   Among the 600, Amnesty International is calling for the release
of 28 it has adopted as prisoners of conscience, and is
investigating the cases of another 70.
   The group defines prisoners of conscience as those ``detained
for belief, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religion
provided they haven't used or advocated violence.'' Students who
threw rocks in demonstrations could not be considered, an official
said.
   While constitutional amendments have strengthened laws
protecting the rights of prisoners, ``in practice these rights are
still not always respected,'' Amnesty International said.
   Government sensitivity to world attention during the Sept. 17 to
Oct. 2 Olympic Games may help improve the situation, but the Games
do not guarantee changes, a representative of the group said.
   The researcher said that in the long-term, ``of course the
attention of the whole world matters ... but things have changed
very quickly in Korea. We just don't know what might happen after
(the games.)''
   The researcher insisted on anonymity, saying it was Amnesty
International policy.

   Radical students engaged in running
street battles with riot police today to protest what they called a
``half Olympics,'' and an opposition leader predicted the Olympic
Games would bring political stability to South Korea.
   The most violent protest was in the southern city of Kwangju,
where 600 students at Chonam University tossed rocks and firebombs
at riot police at an anti-Olympic rally, the South Korean news
agency Yonhap said.
   The news agency said fighting erupted when riot police fired
tear gas to stop students from marching off campus, Yonhap said. No
injuries or arrests were reported. Authorities said about 500
radical students and 50 elderly people held a peaceful rally at
Seoul's Korea University.
   Students in Kwangju and other provincial cities have accused the
government of President Roh Tae-woo of using the Olympic Games to
suppress free movement. The Games will be held in Seoul from Sept.
17 to Oct. 2.
   Radical students have demanded that the Olympics, which they
term ``half-Olympics,'' be shared with communist North Korea to
ease tension on the Korean peninsula, which was divided in 1945 at
the end of World War II.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam said in an interview with The
Associated Press today that he believed the Olympics would unite
the South Korean people.
   Kim said Koreans wanted the Olympics to be a major success and
that he was confident there would be no attempt to disrupt the
Games.
   ``The absolute majority of the Korean people want to see
successful Olympics,'' the president of the Reunification
Democratic Party said.
   Kim also said he doubted communist North Korea would make any
attempt to disrupt the Olympics because of the participation of the
Soviet Union and China. He said North Korea could not afford to
anger its powerful communist allies by staging terrorist attacks on
the Games.
   ``With the participation of the Soviet Union and China in the
Olympics the safety of the Games is assured,'' he said.
   North Korea has boycotted the Olympics and says it won't
participate unless it is allowed to be a co-host at the Games. The
International Olympic Committee said only one city can be a host at
the Olympics.
   South Korean officials have said North Korea might try to stage
terrorist attacks to disrupt the Olympics. North Korea has a long
history of attacks on its southern rival.
   Kim and rival opposition leader Kim Dae-jung both ran in last
December's presidential election, splitting the vote against
government candidate Roh.

<HEAD>`Wizard of Oz' Cinematographer Dies At Age 93</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Rosson, a pioneering cinematographer
whose work included ``The Wizard of Oz'' and who was married to
screen legend Jean Harlow, has died at age 93.
   Rosson died Tuesday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., said Robert
Terry, a nephew.
   His first movie was the silent ``David Harum'' in 1915. He went
on to direct the photography for such movies as ``Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes'' in 1928, ``Treasure Island'' in 1934, ``Duel in the Sun''
in 1947 and ``Singin' in the Rain'' in 1952. His last film was ``El
Dorado,'' in 1967.
   During his 52-year career, many of Hollywood's top directors,
including Cecil B. DeMille, Allan Dwan, Howard Hawks, Josef von
Sternberg and King Vidor, requested him for their films.
   He helped bring the elegant polish to Metro Goldwyn Mayer films
of the 1930s and 1940s, including ``The Wizard of Oz'' in 1939.
   Rosson, a native of New York City, became Ms. Harlow's third and
last husband in 1933. After her death in 1937, he married Yvonne
Crellin. They later divorced. He had no children.
   He shared an honorary Academy Award in 1936 with W. Howard
Greene for pioneering color cinematography on the desert melodrama
``The Garden of Allah.'' Rosson said it was the first color
photography he attempted.
   He was also nominated for Oscars for ``Boom Town,'' in 1940,
``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' in 1944, ``The Asphalt Jungle'' in
1950 and ``The Bad Seed'' in 1956.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Saturday in Hollywood.

<HEAD>Afghan Refugees To Be Trained In Mine Disposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan refugees are to be trained to dispose of
the thousands of land mines left by Soviet and government forces
during the war in Afghanistan, a U.N. official said today.
   The proposed program by the U.N. office coordinating aid for
Afghanistan also calls for public information campaigns to warn
women and children who return home about the danger of mines
planted in Afghan fields and roads.
   ``The first step is to train one or two returnees per village to
have some idea of how to defuse a mine and dispose of it,'' said
the official, an aide to the chief of the Geneva-based office,
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan. The official spoke on condition he not
be identified by name.
   The number of mines littering the Afghan countryside is
estimated at hundreds of thousands to several million, the aide
said.
   Using posters and radio programs, the campaign would ``try to
inform as many as possible on the hazards, so women and children
would be able to recognize a mine and not, for example, pick it
up,'' he said.
   Another aspect would be first aid training ``since there will
unfortunately always be people blown up by mines,'' he added.
   Two basic types of mines were used in Afghanistan: traditional
anti-tank devices placed on roads, mountain passes or around
garrisons, and smaller anti-personnel mines designed to maim people.
   Millions of Afghans fled to neighboring countries such as
Pakistan and Iran to escape the decade-long fighting between the
Soviet-backed Kabul government and Moslem guerrillas seeking its
overthrow.
   The Afghan government says 150,000 refugees have returned home
since the signing of the U.N.-sponsored Afghanistan accord last
April, but the figure has not been independently confirmed.
   Soviet troops intervened in neighboring Afghanistan in December
1978 to help prop up a Marxist government. Under the Afghanistan
agreement, Moscow pledged to withdraw half its contingent by last
month and to complete the pullout by mid-February.
   U.N officials have said the Soviets already have pulled out more
than half its troops.

   Oliver Kingsley Jr., a utility
executive with a reputation for turning around problem nuclear
plants, has been picked to head the Tennessee Valley Authority's
troubled nuclear program.
   Kingsley, 45, succeeds Steven A. White, 59, a retired admiral
whose contract expires in January after 2{ years as senior vice
president of nuclear power at the government utility. TVA Chairman
Marvin Runyon appointed Kingsley on Wednesday.
   Kingsley, vice president of nuclear operations for Systems
Energy Resources Inc. in Jackson, Miss., will join TVA on Oct. 1,
heading a program still recovering from a 2{-year shutdown forced
by safety concerns.
   Kingsley, who helped turn around Farley Nuclear Plant in Alabama
and Grand Gulf Nuclear Plant in Mississippi, said thoroughness is
the key to fixing a nuclear plant.
   ``You've got to meet all the regulatory commitments,'' said
Kingsley. ``You've got to ensure you've got the right people in the
right jobs and they have to be trained. And then you go about that
in a very methodical way.''
   ``TVA's nuclear operation has problems, as do most nuclear
operations today,'' said Kingsley, also a former Navy man. ``But
Admiral White has brought us a long way toward recovery and I fully
intend to carry on that recovery.''
   White, who was hired to turn the troubled nuclear section
around, spent more than $1 billion to rejuvenate the program, which
was shut down in August 1985 because of safety concerns about its
five licensed reactors.
   Since then, Unit 2 at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant outside Chattanooga
has returned to operation and Unit 1 is scheduled for restart this
month. Unit 2 at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant near Athens, Ala., is
expected to be back on line by spring.
   White, who will resign next month, had indicated recently he
would probably leave his $355,200-a-year job when his contract
expires to be with his family in Charlottesville, Va.
   The retired admiral who once headed the Navy's nuclear submarine
program has been under fire from congressional staffers critical of
TVA's nuclear program.
   The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating claims by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission that White lied in 1986 when he told
the NRC that TVA's unlicensed Watts Bar Nuclear Plant near Spring
City, Tenn., met certain safety standards.
   White has denied the charges, and Gerald Charnoff, an attorney
for TVA, said he expects the investigation to be dismissed soon.
   Kingsley will receive $77,300 a year, the maximum for federal
employees, Runyon said. He will be eligible for performance bonuses
that could increase his income to more than $200,000 annually.
   White was hired on a consulting basis, allowing his pay to
exceed the limit.
   Kingsley retired from the Navy in 1971 to join Alabama Power Co.
as senior engineer in nuclear production.
   He became manager at Farley in 1977 and took a similar position
at Grand Gulf in 1984, improving the Mississippi Power and Light
Co. plant from one of the lowest-rated facilities in the South to
one of the highest.
   TVA was created by the government during the Depression to help
bring electricity to the rural South.

   WOODBURY, N.Y. _ Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen told Long Island businessmen today that America will ``pay
the price'' for the huge federal budget deficits of the Reagan
administration.
   But the former Houston insurance executive said the Democratic
ticket understands the needs of business and will fight the
deficits with frugal management and an aggressive trade policy.
   ``During this election, you're going to hear a lot about a
five-year-economic boom,'' he said, referring to the current
expansion. But he said accomplishing that was no trick when the
government was writing ``hot checks'' with deficits of more than
$150 billion a year.
   ``If you listen to this administration, you would think they are
fiscal conservatives,'' he said. ``But they have not submitted one
balanced budget.''
   ``We're all going to pay the price for this borrow-and-spend
philosophy,'' he said.
   Bentsen received a polite reception from the largely Republican
Long Island Association at the breakfast.
   But he got a hearty hand when he said evacuation plans for
nuclear plants should be made at the local level. The Reagan
administration has said the federal government can make those
plans, a controversial stand on Long Island where the Long Island
Lighting Company's Shoreham nuclear plant has been kept from
starting operations for five years because of dispute over whether
Long Island could ever by successfully evacuated in case of an
accident.
   Bentsen arrived on Long Island, after weeks of concentrating in
his native Texas and the South, to begin a three-day,
coast-to-coast campaign trip today with a taste of the food and
money available in New York.
   After his Long Island speech, he was heading to Manhattan for a
fund-raiser for his Senate campaign. He held another Senate
campaign fundraiser Tuesday night in Connecticut.
   Texas law allows Bentsen to run for both the Senate and the vice
presidency. He says he's doing that because dropping out of the
Senate race would automatically hand his seat to a Republican.
   The Carnegie Delicatessan was on Bentsen's schedule this
afternoon. The deli, featured in Woddy Allen's movie ``Broadway
Danny Rose,'' is famous for huge helpings of pastrami, tongue, and
corned beef.
   Both Bentsen and presidential candidate Michael Dukakis are
slated to speak at a gala $5 million Democratic Party fund-raiser
in Manhattan tonight. It was expected to be the largest single
fund-raising event in the party's history.
   Then for Bentsen it's off to Iowa and Califorinia on Friday and
Saturday before returning to Washington on Sunday.
   Bentsen has stopped in Texas on every other campaign swing he
has taken since being named to the ticket, as his home state with
its 29 electoral votes could swing the election. Bentsen was in
Texas earlier this week, and he plans to campaign there again next
week.
   Recent polls show the Democrats trailing the Republicans
slightly in Texas, where George Bush also claims residence.
   The Senate returned from its summer recess this week and both
Bentsen and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, were
in Washington on Wednesday to attend to business there.
   Bentsen told reporters that it will be difficult for the
Congress to do its work given the partisan political atmosphere.
   ``There's no question that it's complicating the process,'' he
said.
   Bentsen renewed his criticism of President Reagan's veto of a
defense bill recently as an attempt to help Bush. ``You're going to
see more and more of that, I'm afraid,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis called for
strengthening America's non-nuclear conventional forces today in a
speech that won a warm reception from an American Legion convention.
   Dukakis praised President Reagan for signing the U.S.-Soviet
treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles, and he lauded
the war record and patriotism of Republican presidential rival
George Bush. Both men had been received in friendly fashion by the
veterans group earlier this week.
   However, Dukakis criticized the administration in connection
with its spending on veterans' programs. And he suggested the
national debt, which has risen sharply during the Reagan
administration, would cramp efforts to build up the nation's
military might.
   ``After eight years and $2 trillion, we still don't have an
anti-tank weapon that can stop modern Soviet tanks,'' Dukakis said.
``We cannot build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt.''
   Dukakis gave no specifics on his plans to improve conventional
forces and said at a news conference later that he would give
details next week.
   Also at the news conference, Dukakis said he would support
deployment of the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative if
research proved it would work and if it was determined to be in the
national interest.
   However, when questioned on the issue, Dukakis said deployment
of SDI would be a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty with the Soviet Union and he did not want to scrap that pact.
   ``I think it is in our best interest to observe that treaty,''
Dukakis said. ``For our own sake, we have to continue with
research.''
   Dukakis said he was not worried about a new ABC-Washington Post
poll, showing him behind Bush by 8 percentage points.
   ``I don't think we're slipping, and I don't think we're in
disarray,'' he said.
   Wednesday night, in Baltimore, Dukakis promised a Jewish group
that he would provide ``generous'' aid to Israel, while he attacked
the Republicans for selling weapons to its Middle East enemies.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I are going to say `no' to Arab shopping
lists that endanger the security of Israel,'' Dukakis said.
   In interviews with Louisville television stations Wednesday
night, Dukakis said his call for a ``tough, strong lean defense''
will be tempered by the need for a strong economy.
   Speaking Wednesday to a convention of B'nai B'rith, the
Democratic presidential nominee referred repeatedly to his wife,
who is Jewish, and gave a new year's greeting in Hebrew as he tried
to demonstrate a sensitivity to Jewish culture and concerns.
   The Massachusetts governor drew cheers when he told the
convention that in a Dukakis administration ``there will be no
trips to Bitburg,'' referring to President Reagan's visit to a West
German cemetery where members of the Nazi SS were buried.
   As Dukakis was finishing his speech in Baltimore, his campaign
vice chairman, John Sasso, was meeting in New York with Jesse
Jackson, whose support for the Palestinians has angered American
Jews.
   Dukakis press secretary Dayton Duncan said he had no details on
the meeting between Sasso and Jackson.
   In his B'nai B'rith speech, which came shortly after one
delivered by Republican presidential nominee George Bush, Dukakis
referred only in passing to the Palestinian uprising in Israel's
occupied territories on the West Bank and said that as president he
would not recognize a ``unilateral'' declaration of a Palestinian
state.
   He pledged continued U.S. aid to Israel, which he praised as ``a
special place ... committed to peace.''
   ``From the day of Israel's rebirth four decades ago, we
Americans have understood that Israel's fate is our fate,'' he said.
   ``We're going to continue to help Israel defend itself by
providing generous levels of military and economic aid,'' Dukakis
said.
   However, he singled out Dan Quayle, the Republican vice
presidential nominee, for voting in Congress against packages
aiding Israel, and faulted Republicans for selling aircraft and
missiles to other nations in the Middle East.
   ``The Republicans have sold AWACS to Saudi Arabia, Mavericks to
Kuwait, Stingers to Bahrain and billions of additional dollars
worth of sophisticated arms to Arab countries that refuse to make
peace with Israel,'' Dukakis said. ``Mr. Bush has supported those
sales, and Dan Quayle has voted for them.
   ``We will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of
Israel to any nation,'' Dukakis said. ``And we will work to
persuade our NATO allies to join us in that policy.''

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Discuss Problem-Plagued Spaceflight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmonauts just returned from a problem-plagued
space mission described cramped quarters, food and water shortages
and equipment problems but did not address questions about their
performance, a Tass dispatch indicated today.
   The government newspaper Izvestia had suggested Wednesday that
the commander of the Soyuz TM-5 capsule, stranded in orbit for a
day, may have worsened equipment problems by not following proper
emergency procedures.
   The capsule, carrying commander Vladimir Lyakhov and the first
Afghan in space, Abdul Ahad Mohmand, landed safely early Wednesday
in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   At a news conference today for Soviet and Afghan reporters at
the Baikonur Space Center, near the landing site, the cosmonauts
said they had only 105 cubic feet between them.
   They were stuck in the capsule for 26 hours.
   ``Immobility was the biggest problem,'' Tass, the official news
agency, reported.
   The cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water, but
decided not to use it until absolutely necessary, Tass said.
   Other reports have said the capsule had no toilet, virtually no
room to move around, and enough air for only two days.
   The spacemen were asked about problems that forced postponement
of their reentry after their capsule undocked Tuesday from the
orbiting space station Mir.
   ``During the first landing attempt, undertaken on Sept. 6,
everything went as scheduled,'' Tass quoted Lyakhov as saying.
``But 30 seconds before the engine start-up, there occurred a
disruption in the operation of the infrared vertical sensor. The
computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was correctly
oriented, and the engine was shut off.''
   The engine Lyakhov referred to is supposed to brake the capsule
so it can safely pass through the atmosphere.
   The cosmonaut said a second attempt to fire the engine was made
later, but that it slowed the capsule too much and the burn was
terminated. Landing was put off until Wednesday.
   Tass did not report any comments by the crew at the news
conference about their performance.
   The newspaper said reporters asked deputy flight chief Viktor
Blagov whether the commander failed to follow proper procedure
during the second landing attempt.
   Izvestia quoted Blagov as saying: ``We still must painstakingly
study the whole situation.''
   Blagov said backup landing sites could have been used, so there
was no rush to fire the reentry engine. Then, appearing to defend
Lyakhov, he said it ``could be understood in a purely human way''
why the commander wanted to land at the designated time and place.
   Lyakhov had said in a capsule-side interview broadcast on
television Wednesday that he and Mohmand had wanted to make a third
attempt at landing on Tuesday but that the craft might have touched
down outside Soviet territory. He said the crew preferred to wait
until landing could be assured in Kazakhstan.
   Lyakhov, a 47-year-old veteran military pilot, flew in space for
175 days in 1979 and 150 days in 1983.
   The public questioning of a cosmonaut's performance was highly
unusual in the Soviet space program. It reflected the more open
discussion of problems encouraged by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev under his policy of ``glasnost.''

   The parents of a black teen-ager who
was barred from playing tennis with her high school team at an
all-white country club have sued for $2 million.
   The Rev. Johnny Whitfield and his wife, Lorene, filed the civil
rights suit Wednesday in federal court on behalf of themselves and
their daughter, Theresa, 16.
   In April, Miss Whitfield went with the Earle High School team to
Forrest City for a match at the Forrest City Country Club. The suit
contends that the Forrest City high school coach told her she
couldn't play at the club.
   The girl and her opponent went to a city court to play their
match.
   Named as defendants are the tennis coaches, Jack Hosford at
Earle and Charles Bowlin at Forrest City, the school districts and
the private club.
   ``We hope to send an emphatic message to those people who would
do such a thing against a young girl,'' said the Whitfields'
attorney, Ronald Wilson.
   Calls Wednesday to Bowlin's home went unanswered. In July, he
told reporters he was following long-standing Forrest City Country
Club rules in barring the black teen-ager from playing there.
   ``I really and truly thought the country clubs had the right to
tell us who had the right to play,'' Bowlin said.
   He said that he wrote a letter of apology to Miss Whitfield and
that he would cooperate with Miss Whitfield and her attorneys ``in
seeing that this custom and practice is ended immediately.''
   Dan Dennis, country club president, had said that the club has
no written policy prohibiting blacks. He did not return a telephone
call Wednesday.
   There was no answer at either school district's office Wednesday
and no listing for Hosford in Earle.

   The skipper of the USS Vincennes was warned
that a plane approaching the ship July 3 might be a commercial
airliner, but he ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken
belief it was an Iranian F-14, Navy investigators told Congress
today.
   The warning was called out by one of the officers in the
confusion of the combat center on the Vincennes, the investigators
said. Capt. Will C. Rogers waved his hand in acknowledgement of the
warning.
   But other factors, most of them human errors by crew members
made under stress, led Rogers to erroneously conclude that the
plane approaching his ship was an Iranian military jet that had
just taken off from a military-civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas.
   Iran Air Flight 655, which had flown out of the same airfield,
was shot down by two missiles from the Vincennes in the Strait of
Hormuz, killing all 292 persons aboard.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, head of the Navy investigating
team, said his probe had turned up a number of mistakes by the
Vincennes crew.
   Among those mistakes were erroneously concluding that the plane
was descending rather than climbing, and that the plane was outside
a civilian air corridor.
   Fogarty outlined to the Senate Armed Services Committee the
report released by the Pentagon three weeks ago.
   There was no criticism of Rogers among panel members.
   ``The easiest thing any of us can do is second-guess, and that's
not what we want to do,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The Vincennes is a $1 billion Aegis-class cruiser, equipped with
the Navy's most sophisticated air defense system.
   Navy investigators attributed the incident to human errors made
under stress and during ``the fog of war.'' They said Navy officers
misread data from the Aegis system and gave mistaken information to
Rogers.
   A public version of the report was released three weeks ago. A
classified version has also been sent to Capitol Hill.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said many of the questions surrounding the incident had been
answered by the Fogarty investigation.
   ``But we want a chance to talk to him in person and ask some
questions,'' Nunn explained. ``I think we are going to be looking
at how the Aegis system performed, how the weapons on board
performed, and other secondary questions like that.''
   The Fogarty investigation found that the Aegis system worked as
designed.
   ``Overall, I think I'm pretty sympathetic to the plight of the
captain and I think there's a lot of sympathy for him here, given
the compressed time frame for making a decision and given the other
constraints of operating a blue-water ship in a brown-water
environment,'' Nunn said.
   He was referring to using the Vincennes, which was designed for
large-scale, open-ocean situations, in the small, crowded Persian
Gulf. The ship was on duty as part of the Reagan administration
policy of protecting tankers in the gulf.
   Nunn's comments echoed statements made by top Pentagon officers
last month when the report was released.
   Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said that given the confusion surrounding an earlier fight between
the Vincennes and Iranian gunboats, ``Capt. Rogers acted reasonably
and did what his nation expected of him in the defense of his ship
and crew.''
   Crowe called the airliner's destruction ``a by-product'' of the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. The two nations are now negotiating
through the United Nations to end the conflict.
   The Vincennes was to leave from the Persian Gulf last Sunday,
but its departure has been postponed until U.S. officials have been
assured there is no longer a need for U.S. tanker escorts in the
region.
   The Vincennes' withdrawal from the carrier battle group in the
Arabian Sea would reduce the American naval force in the region
from 27 to 26 warships, the first reduction since the Iran-Iraq
cease-fire officially went into effect Aug. 15.
   The Pentagon says the U.S. fleet will be scaled back if the
cease-fire holds. But it has given no timetable, and other ships in
the force are still being replaced on schedule.

   Walter Hudson, who weighed 1,200 to 1,400
pounds last year, walked out the door of his home for the first
time in 18 years today, announcing he was down to 520 pounds.
   ``It all looks pretty good,'' he said outside, with sunglasses
on. ``I shouldn't have waited this long.''
   With his every step covered on live television, Hudson pushed
himself up from a couch, walked through two interior doorways and
stepped out his back door onto a specially built patio. He sat in a
chair made of concrete.
   Hudson, 43 years old and 6 feet tall, came to public attention
last year when he became wedged in a doorway at his home in this
Long Island community. Firefighters had to cut him free.
   Comedian-turned-nutritionist Dick Gregory got him started on a
diet. Barbara Rosen, a psychologist, later took Hudson's case.

   George Bush today watched the destruction of U.S. missile stages
as part of a U.S.-Soviet treaty and called it ``a moment when the
tides of history turned.'' Michael Dukakis blended economic and
military messages, telling the American Legion the nation can't
build defense ``on a mountain of debt.''
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, flew to Texas to
watch the missile engines destroyed today as Democrat Dukakis got a
warm reception from the veterans group in Louisville, Ky.
   The night before, in Baltimore, the presidential rivals stressed
concern for Israel while sharply criticizing each other. Bush said
Dukakis waffles on creation of a Palestinian state and Dukakis
accused the Republican ticket of supporting the sale of arms to
Israel's foes.
   Bush, at the Pershing missile-engine destruction, said it was
``the day we began to reverse the arms race ... one of those unique
moments in the career of man, a moment when the tides of history
turned, that a new future dawned.''
   He joined other U.S. and Soviet officials at the Longhorn Army
Ammunition plant to see destruction of the engines, which are part
of the 859 weapons the United States has agreed to destory over the
next three years under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   The Soviet Union has already destroyed several of its
counterpart SS-20 missiles.
   Dukakis, speaking today to the American Legion, one day after
Bush addressed the group, said the United States must improve its
conventional, non-nuclear forces.
   ``After eight years and $2 trillion, we still don't have an
anti-tank weapon that can stop modern Soviet tanks,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic presidential nominee, who has frequently
criticized the Reagan administration for allowing the national debt
to soar, said, ``We cannot build a strong national defense on a
mountain of debt.''
   Both candidates made their cases Wednesday as advocates of
Israel while addressing the convention of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish
service organization.
   ``Strength works better than weakness if you want to get both
peace and security,'' Bush said.
   He said he opposes creation of a Palestinian state but believes
Palestinians ``must be involved at every step'' in the peace
negotiations with Israel.
   The Republican vice president charged Dukakis lacks a clear
stand on creation of a Palestinian state, saying: ``Anyone who has
trouble making up his mind on this issue, or who proposes to leave
it open, just doesn't understand the dangers to Israel and to the
United States; just doesn't understand the very real threats that
continue to exist.''
   Dukakis, answering that he would ``never recognize a unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state or government in exile,'' went
on to criticize Bush and running mate Dan Quayle for supporting
arms sales to Arab countries that are potential threats to Israel.
   ``We will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of
Israel to any nation,'' the Democratic nominee said, after reading
off a list of weapons sales to Arab countries with the support of
Bush and Quayle.
   Bush received a boost in the latest ABC News-Washington Post
poll, which showed the Republican candidate ahead of Dukakis 51
percent to 43 percent.
   The survey of 1,104 likely voters was conducted Aug. 31 to Sept.
6 and had a margin of error of 3.5 points.
   The Post cautioned that the results may be unusual because many
people were away from their homes during the Labor Day holiday.
Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said the candidate always believed
it would be a tight race.
   In an apparent effort to defuse Democratic claims that he is
insensitive to the concerns of working people, Bush told
Knight-Ridder newspapers that he will soon propose boosting the
minimum wage.
   The administration opposes an increase, and campaign sources
said Bush was expected to link his proposal with a call for a
training wage, below the regular minimum wage, to cover new hires
and teen-agers.
   Top Bush aides were linked in published and broadcast reports to
lobbying activity for the Bahamas and Prime Minister Lynden
Pindling, who has been under investigation in this country because
of alleged drug activities.
   The reports centered on a 20-page contract proposal in which the
lobbying firm of Black, Manafort & Stone said it could create a
``backchannel relationship'' with the administration and counter
criticism by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater, senior adviser Charles Black and
scheduler Paul J. Manafort were named in the proposal. The firm
charged $800,000 for the lobbying activity from April 1985 to
September 1986.
   Bush at the time was head of a drug-enforcement effort that
included investigations of Pindling. Bush spokesman Mark Goodin
characterized the contract language as ``salesman's hyperbole.''
   Dukakis today received the endorsement of the 1.9 million-member
National Education Association.
   Quayle, tending to Senate duties Wednesday, was damned with
faint praise by Senate minority leader and former presidential
candidate Bob Dole.
   Dole said he thought Quayle was ``becoming an asset'' to the
Republican ticket, and he put the stress on ``becoming.''
   For Bush, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 1988, may not exactly live in
infamy but is at least a likely entry in the political blunder hall
of fame.
   Explaining how he wrongly told the American Legion crowd that
Sept. 7 was the anniversary of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl
Harbor that brought America into World War II, instead of the Dec.
7 date Franklin Roosevelt declared would live in infamy, Bush said:
   ``I wanted to work Pearl Harbor in and just got carried away.''

   About 1 million people, including
government officials and intelligence agents, marched in the
capital today demanding democracy. Mobs beheaded three people who
tried to poison the protesters.
   In a Rangoon suburb, security forces shot and injured 17 people
to halt looting.
   The capital came to a standstill as uniformed state factory
workers, Buddhist monks and Catholic nuns, housewives and a group
of 200 blind people joined in mass marches and a general strike to
demand an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule.
   The Soviet Union, China, Japan and other foreign governments
evacuated dependents of diplomats and other citizens, diplomats
said. An attempt by the United States to do the same was delayed by
an airport strike.
   Residents said more than 700,000 protesters marched in Mandalay,
350 miles north of Rangoon, and the same number in Monywa, an
important trading town 60 miles northwest of Mandalay. About
100,000 marched in Moulmein, the Mon State capital 50 miles
southeast of Rangoon.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok said the evacuations were ordered
because embassies believed the country was ``sliding toward chaos.''
   Factory workers, Buddhist monks, Catholic nuns, students and
teachers marched through the capital to press for an end of
repressive, one-party rule. Opposition leaders are demanding an
interim government to usher in a multiparty system.
   Also participating were employees of the Council of State, the
Parliament office, the Bureau of Special Investigation, or civilian
intelligence, and uniformed officers of the state-owned shipping
line. Most held banners identifying their groups.
   The protest was the largest in Burma since Aug. 24, when
President Maung Maung lifted martial law in the capital and
nationwide curfews.
   Today's march was largely peaceful, but sources said a mob beat
to death two men and a woman who gave poisoned ice water to several
demonstrators, including schoolchildren, and then beheaded them.
   Demonstrators took the three to a monastery. After they
confessed to having been paid $42 each to poison protesters, a
waiting mob dragged them outside and beheaded them, hanging their
heads on posts at a major junction. It was not clear whether any
protesters had been poisoned.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said security forces today shot and
wounded 17 people as authorities moved to stop a mob of 500 people
from looting a cigarette factory in a Rangoon suburb. An army
officer was overpowered by mobs and beaten near the capital's
Swedagon Pagoda, it said.
   The radio said authorities the previous day retrieved from Inya
Lake seven bodies of people who had been stabbed and drowned.
   Government radio had said Wednesday that security forces had
shot dead five people and wounded six to halt widespread looting in
the capital the past two days. It said looting had broken out in 38
areas of the capital and that more than $43 million in state
property had been plundered since the beginning of August.
   The deaths brought to at least 117 the number of protesters
reported killed by security forces since last month. Foreign
diplomats say the death toll could be in the hundreds.
   Diplomatic sources said 37 dependents of Soviet Embassy
officials were evacuated Wednesday. The Soviet Union and the United
States, with about 50 nationals, have the largest missions in
Rangoon.
   The sources said China had recalled more than 100 technicians
and others would be evacuated.
   Japanese authorities said Japan, Burma's largest aid donor,
recently evacuated some dependents of embassy staff and has urged
businessmen and dependents of Japanese nationals to leave Burma.
   Others embassies also were evacuating dependents.
   The U.S. Embassy had planned to evacuate the first of its up to
100 dependents today, but their commercial flight to Bangkok,
Thailand, was canceled due to a strike at Rangoon Airport.
   Opposition leaders hoped today's would be the largest of the
many mass protests that have driven two governments from office in
less than two months.
   Demonstrators have not threatened foreigners and the U.S.
Embassy has been a popular rallying point, with protesters
applauding the American flag.
   Leaders of the Burma Socialist Program Party planned a meeting
Monday to consider a referendum on one-party rule, despite a
protesters' demand for an interim government first.
   The party has ruled since a 1962 military coup that brought Ne
Win to power. His rigid socialist and isolationist policies have
made Burma one of the world's poorest nations.
   Turmoil began in Burma with student riots in September 1987 that
led to street protests in March and June.
   Ne Win resigned July 23 and was succeeded by a hard-line former
general, Sein Lwin, who lasted only 17 days. He was replaced by
Maung Maung, Burma's first civilian leader since 1962.
   Maung Maung called for the referendum on ending one-party rule.

   A space mission that endangered two cosmonauts
was hastily organized for ``pure propaganda'' reasons and the
crewmen were lucky to escape with their lives, according to an
American expert on the Soviet space program.
   James Oberg said Soyuz TM-5, with an Afghan crewman aboard, was
rushed into space a year ahead of schedule to assure that it flew
before Soviet troops completed withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``They asked for this trouble by throwing this mission together
for pure propaganda,'' said Oberg, a space engineer and author of
several books on the Soviet space program.
   The craft landed safely Wednesday after a tense 24 hours in
which malfunctions threatened to leave the cosmonauts marooned in
orbit.
   In a telephone interview, Oberg said he believes the cosmonauts
``were seconds away from death'' when a de-orbit rocket engine shut
down prematurely left the Soyuz TM-5 in an orbit 155 miles above
the Earth. Had the rocket fired for only a minute longer, he said,
the craft could have fallen through the atmosphere and burned.
   Nicholas Johnson, another U.S. space expert, agreed that the
Soyuz mission was organized quickly, but he doubts the rush was
related to the malfunction.
   ``It (the mission) was accelerated and there is every reason to
believe it was politically motivated,'' said Johnson, who works for
Teledyne Brown engineering in Colorado Springs, Colo., a major
space contractor. ``But that had absolutely no impact on the
problem that occurred on the spacecraft.''
   Soyuz TM-5, commanded by veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and
with Abdul Ahad Mohmand of Afghanistan on board, undocked from the
Mir space station early Tuesday on what was expected to be a
three-hour flight back to Earth. But the craft's braking rocket
failed to fire on time and then, seven minutes later, fired
automatically for three seconds.
   Two orbits later, the rocket fired again, but shut down after
about 60 seconds. This left the craft in a 155-mile orbit.
   A third attempt was successful and the Soyuz landed safely and
on target in the Soviet province of Kazakhstan.
   At a news conference today for Soviet and Afghan reporters at
the Baikonur Space Center, near the landing site, the cosmonauts
said they had only 105 cubic feet between them. They were stuck in
the capsule for 26 hours.
   The cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water, but
decided not to use it until absolutely necessary, Tass, the
official news agency, reported. Other reports have said the capsule
had no toilet, virtually no room to move around, and enough air for
only two days.
   The spacemen were asked to describe what happened after their
capsule undocked Tuesday from the orbiting space station Mir.
   ``During the first landing attempt, undertaken on Sept. 6,
everything went as scheduled,'' Tass quoted Lyakhov as saying.
``But 30 seconds before the engine start-up, there occurred a
disruption in the operation of the infrared vertical sensor. The
computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was correctly
oriented, and the engine was shut off.''
   Oberg said that based on Soviet public discussions and on
tracking data collected by the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Springs, he believes the problem was caused by some type of
computer ``software glitch.''
   ``The lighting at the de-orbit burn was not standard, and had
never been followed in the four previous TM flights,'' said Oberg.
``The TM is a completely re-engineered spacecraft with new
computers, new software, new guidance.''
   He said the Soyuz TM aligns itself for the braking rocket firing
by taking readings with a guidance sensor on the Earth's horizon.
On the four earlier flights, these readings were taken as the Soyuz
TM craft were approaching sunrise. For Soyuz TM-5, said Oberg, the
readings were taken after sunset, in the darkness.
   Oberg said he believes the ``fault detection'' system in the
computer was ``falsely rejecting the data'' from the sensor.
   ``The computer disbelieved the data,'' he said. In the first
attempt, the machine failed to fire the rocket until it received
acceptable data. This came seven minutes too late, and the
cosmonauts manually turned off the rocket after three seconds. Two
orbits later, the computer turned the rocket on and it fired for
about 60 seconds, Oberg said, before it again automatically halted
the rocket engine.
   ``The cutoff of that burn was lucky for them,'' he said. ``It
was a life-saving accident.''
   Johnson disagreed with Oberg's assessment.
   ``I give the Soviets credit enough to program the computer in
such a manner that it would not shut down'' and leave the craft in
``a hazardous position,'' Johnson said.
   But Oberg said that ``all of the Soviet statements are
consistent with this scenario.''
   He said permitting the computer to fire the engine randomly
``was pretty sloppy flying'' by the cosmonaut crew.
   Oberg also said ``it was unreasonable to assume that the
computer software would be smart enough to shut down'' the rocket
engine and to automatically leave the craft in a safe orbit. He
said it would take months to develop and test a computer program
for the lighting conditions encountered by Soyuz TM-5 and ``it's
clear they didn't have the time to do it right.''
   Soviet spacefarers usually receive 18 months of training and
preparation before a mission, and Oberg said the crew of Soyuz TM-5
was together for only six months before launch.

<HEAD>Paper's Attorney Says JOA Should Be Allowed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge was urged today to allow
Detroit's two daily newspapers to complete a partial merger under a
joint operating agreement approved last month by then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.
   Attorney Clark Clifford dismissed suggestions by opponents of
the joint operating agreement (JOA) that Meese had ignored the
conclusions of an administrative law judge that the papers didn's
qualify for the anti-trust exemption.
   Meese ``is under no compunction at any stage of the proceeding
to accept any conclusion of the administrative law judge,'' said
Clifford, who represents Knight-Ridder, Inc., owner of the Detroit
Free Press.
   Before leaving office last month, Meese found that the Free
Press, a morning paper that has lost $100 million in nine years,
was a failing newspaper under the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Meese approved a joint operating agreement between the Free
Press and the Detroit News, owned by Gannett Co., Inc. The partial
merger was temporarily blocked by court order until U.S. District
Judge George Revercomb has a chance to rule on a legal challenge.
   Revercomb said he would issue a ruling by next week.
   William Schultz, an attorney representing Michigan Citizens for
an ndependent Press, charged that the two dailies engaged in a
bitter war of price cutting to either put each other out of
business or qualify for a lucrative joint operating agreement.
   ``Did Congress intend to give large corporations like Gannett
and Knight-Ridder the opportunity to gain a JOA simply by cutting
prices, thus creating a record of loss?'' Schultz said.
   Justice Department attorney Thomas Millet said ``there
absolutely was no evidence of collusion'' between the Free Press
and The News, which was bought by Gannett in 1986, several months
before the joint operating agreement was formally sought.
   ``The fact that these two papers considered the option and
discussed this over a period of time is not an argument that a JOA
shouldn't occur,'' Millet said.
   Those discussions were a ``natural consequence'' of the fact
that both papers sustained losses while cutting advertising and
circulation rates to gain dominance in the market, Millet said.
   Clifford, an elder statesman of the Democratic Party who served
as defense secretary under President Johnson, said the News had
rejected several Free Press overtures to joint their production and
commercial departments.
   The News was ``determined to keep the Free Press as far down as
they can because in the news business you try to become the
dominant paper,'' Clifford said. ``As soon as you find yourself in
the second position, you are probably on your way out.''
   While the Free Press was locked in bitter competition with the
News, ``every year except one, they lost more money than they lost
the year before.''
   ``Knight-Ridder, during the eight-year period, poured $176
million into the Free Press in an effort to keep it afloat,''
Clifford said. ``At the end of the period, the Free Press was
losing more money then they were at the beginning.''
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close the Free Press if the
joint operating agreement is not allowed to go through.
   Clifford said closing the Free Press would cost 2,200 jobs while
between 600 and 800 jobs would be eliminated if the two dailies
combined their business operations.
   Schultz argued that Meese's decision was arbitrary because he
ignored the administrative law judge's recommendation.
   Meese disregarded the administrative law judge's conclusion that
if the partial merger were not approved, the News, which has also
posted significant losses, would eventually raise its prices,
thereby allowing the Free Press to do the same, Schultz said.
   Clifford said many of the administrative law judge's conclusions
``got so far beyond the question of fact that you get into the
realm of speculation.''
   Millet said the opponents have to prove ``the decision is
irrational, not that they don't like it or they think the
administrative law judge recommended a contrary result.''

   Republican presidential nominee George
Bush today viewed the fiery destruction of a set of U.S.
intermediate-range missile engines and said the demolition marks
``the day we began to reverse the arms race.''
   The vice president, who watched as the two Pershing missile
engines were fired _ the first to be destroyed deliberately under
the U.S.-Soviet arms reduction treaty, said this is ``one of those
unique moments in the career of man, a moment when the tides of
history turned, that a new future dawned.''
   Bush joined other U.S. and Soviet officials on the reviewing
stand at the Longhorn Army Ammunition plant here to witness the
demolition of the two engines, which are among the 859 weapons that
the two superpowers have agreed to destroy over the next three
years.
   Peering through binoculars from a distance of about 1,000 feet,
the vice president watched as the motor of a Pershing II missile
engine was fired to burn up its fuel followed by the firing of a
smaller Pershing 1a rocket engine.
   The destruction was accompanied by a thunderous blast that
lasted about a minute and then a loud cheer from those on the
reviewing stand.
   The Soviet Union has already demolished several of its
counterpart SS-20 missiles under the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty signed last December.
   ``We, too, are sending our INF missiles to the junkyards,'' Bush
said. ``The missile stages we destroy today are just a beginning.
It is a moment we will be able to tell our children and
grandchildren about _ this was the day we began to reverse the arms
race, this was the day we began destroying the weapons of
destruction.''
   Nuclear warheads of the missiles are to be dismantled under the
same agreement.
   Even though the Bush campaign paid for the trip, the GOP nominee
was attending the event in his official capacity as vice president,
aides said.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, told reporters he did not
believe the vice president had unfair advantage over Dukakis
because of his ability to participate in the program.
   ``George Bush has been associated with the efforts to achieve an
INF treaty for many years. It's something I think he is
legitimately entitled to participate in,'' Fuller said.
   On Wednesday, Bush said he ``just got messed up'' when he told
an American Legion audience that it was the 47th anniversary of
Pearl Harbor Day _ three months in advance of the actual day.
   Bush's embarrassing gaffe, which he corrected after noticing the
perplexed expressions in his audience, happened when ``I wanted to
work Pearl Harbor in and just got carried away,'' he told reporters
traveling with him on Air Force Two.
   ``I looked up and saw incredulity on the face of one particular
guy and I thought, `Whoops! My heavens I've done it!' So I was glad
to correct it.''
   Bush received a boost in the latest ABC News-Washington Post
poll, which showed the Republican candidate ahead of Democratic
Presidential nominee Michael Dukakis 51 percent to 43 percent.
   The survey of 1,104 likely voters was conducted Aug. 31 to Sept.
6 and had a margin of error of 3.5 points.
   The Post cautioned that the results may be unusual because many
people were away from their homes during the Labor Day holiday.
   In an apparent effort to defuse Democratic claims that he is
insensitive to the concerns of working people, Bush told
Knight-Ridder newspapers that he will soon propose an increase in
the minimum wage.
   The administration opposes an increase, and campaign sources
said Bush was expected to link the increase with a below-minimum
training wage for new hires and for teen-agers.
   Bush told the B'nai B'rith convention Wednesday in Baltimore
that the treaty ``to eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapons''
could not have been negotiated from a position of weakness.
   ``Strength works better than weakness if you want to get both
peace and security,'' Bush said.
   Bush did not refer to Dukakis directly in his speech to the
B'nai B'rith, a national Jewish service organization. But in his
earlier talk to the American Legion convention in Louisville, Ky.,
he suggested his rival's defense policies would ``leave America
hostage to Soviet ballistic missiles.''
   He said Soviets were now deploying two new intercontinental
ballistic missiles. ``So even with perestroika, Soviet military
modernization has not slackened,'' he said. ``Soviet military
spending continues to rise.''
   Bush also:
   _Told the B'nai B'rith that he opposes creation of a Palestinian
state but believes Palestinians ``must be involved at every step''
in the peace negotiations with Israel.
   _ Said anti-abortion demonstrators ``went too far'' in recent
noisy protests against Democratic rival Michael Dukakis.

   E. Robert Wallach, awaiting trial on
racketeering charges in the Wedtech bribery case, said today he was
an innocent man victimized by the media and investigators out to
drive former Attorney General Edwin Meese III from office.
   Wallach, at a news conference at the National Press Club,
defended his longtime friend, saying Meese had received more
``calumny from the American media'' than any public official in
memory.
   ``I am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort to
drive Ed Meese from office. ... I proved to be a most attractive
vehicle to help accomplish that goal,'' said the San Francisco
trial attorney.
   He said he had made some ``honest mistakes'' in Washington. ``I
think I came into the big leagues thinking I had had adequate
spring training when I hadn't,'' he said.
   ``I'm telling you the sytem caught an innocent man and the media
played a role in it,'' said Wallach.
   ``The Bob Wallach that was portrayed in The Washington Post, in
The New York Times, in most publications which covered me ... never
existed, does not exist, did not exist,'' he said.
   ``I had on one side of me Wedtech and on the other side of me
Edwin Meese III. How could I not have been an attractive object for
the media?'' said Wallach, who complained that his life and the
lives of his children had been invaded by ``the anonymous assassins
of the media.''
   He depicted himself as a self-made man, grandson of a
button-hole maker who won a scholarship and worked his way through
college to become a pillar of the San Francisco bar and backer of
liberal causes.
   Wallach lodged the same complaints Wednesday night at an
American University forum, where he told 300 people, ``I was
convicted before I was indicted. I was convicted by the American
media.''
   Wallach goes on trial Jan. 3 in New York on federal racketeering
and conspiracy charges.
   Wallach is accused of taking payoffs from Wedtech officials to
influence Meese and other public officials. Wedtech was a fledgling
defense contractor and favorite of the Reagan administration that
collapsed in a bribery scandal in 1986.
   Joining Wallach on the American University panel were Lyn
Nofziger, the former White House political director who is
appealing his conviction for illegal lobbying, and two reporters.
   Wallach said he would not ``back one inch away'' from the
media's First Amendment freedom, but that ``does not give them
authority to desecrate the Sixth Amendment right: the presumption
of innocence.''
   Meese resigned as attorney general last month, shortly before a
special prosecutor decided not to indict him.
   Wallach claimed that special prosecutor James McKay's only goal
was to drive Meese from the attorney general's office, and ``I
became an appropriate ... vehicle to help to accomplish that.''
   Nofziger, sentenced to 90 days in jail and a $30,000 fine for
illegally lobbying former White House colleagues, said some
reporters are careless, but he received fair coverage at his trial.
   ``You can't point a finger at the profession,'' he said.
   Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post and James Polk of NBC News
both said the press had no power to indict or convict anyone.
   Polk said Wallach's problems stemmed from his indictment and the
special
   But Polk said he personally feels the press ``has fostered an
assumption of guilt on the part of Bob Wallach before trial.''
Polk, who said juries often begin with the assumption that a
defendant is guilty, also expressed the opinion that Nofziger ``was
unfairly convicted.''

   Most of the 1,000 or so people evacuated
along the coast learned today they'd have to wait another day to
return to their homes, swamped by a four-day torrent that swept
away a motorist and drowned a toddler.
   ``We have to make sure everything is OK before we let people
back in,'' Red Cross spokeswoman Rita Dralus said before some
people were allowed to return this morning. ``There are water
mocassins and there are gators because ponds have overflowed, and
electricity and water definitely don't mix.''
   Much of the flooding in the Bradenton-Palmetto area of Tampa Bay
subsided by late morning, and most roads were declared passable and
reopened.
   All schools that had been closed Wednesday were reopened today
except for Bradenton Middle School, which had suffered water damage.
   The National Guard was put on alert Wednesday as residents
bailed out from the 9 to 15 inches of rain that have fallen along
the state's central Gulf Coast since Sunday, turning streets into
rivers and spilling sewage into living rooms.
   It is the area's heaviest rain in a decade, surpassing the
deluge that accompanied Hurricane Elena in 1985.
   ``We just cannot handle all that rain,'' said George Parks,
Manatee County's drainage superintendant. ``It's the worst we've
had in the 11 years I've been here.''
   The rain fell from a near-stationary cold front hovering across
the central Florida peninsula. The National Weather Service
predicted that 4 more inches could fall today before the front
slowly moved northeast.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also predicted today for southern
Georgia and coastal South Carolina, but no other flood warnings
were issued.
   Almost all low-lying areas were flooded in 10 Tampa Bay-area
counties. Most rivers were either flooded or forecast to reach
flood stage.
   In Tampa, divers were still searching for James Edward Mercer,
45, who disappeared in floodwaters after a car stalled in a
drainage ditch and began to float. Three passengers were rescued by
passersby.
   Witnesses saw Mercer surface in the murky water, his arms
flailing, but he was towed under by the strong current before
rescuers could reach him, said Tampa police spokesman Steve Cole.
   ``I feel certain that he is deceased, but we haven't found
him,'' police Lt. Mary Williams said late Wednesday.
   In New Port Richey, 2-year-old Matthew Rehm wandered behind his
home and drowned in a rain-swelled canal, authorities said.
   At least 1,000 people in the region evacuated their homes, with
some staying in shelters and others taking refuge in motels or with
friends in less-soaked areas.
   The 350 people spending Wednesday night in Manatee County's
three Red Cross shelters were told they would not be allowed to
return home until emergency officials declared the flood-damaged
areas safe.
   Nursing assistant Guy Hardin, 32, grabbed a blanket and a
toothbrush and spent Wednesday night in a Red Cross shelter at
Manatee Community College after his Bradenton duplex was flooded
out.
   ``The water was halfway up my calf and that was inside the
house,'' Hardin said. ``Everything on the floor was pretty much
ruined. The sewer backed up. In the house, it smells like a septic
tank. I don't want to go back.''
   Water depths of 4 to 5 feet were common on streets before levels
began dropping as the steady rain turned into a drizzle Wednesday
afternoon.
   ``We had police officers in dump trucks patrolling the city,''
said City Councilman Terry Wells in Palmetto, across the Manatee
River from Bradenton. The Red Cross also opened three shelters in
Tampa as floodwaters left cars in some sections of south Tampa
submerged to their windshields.
   Elsewhere in Florida, the bad weather was blamed for weakening
the clay foundation under a 500-ton construction crane that toppled
in Gainesville, trapping a 76-year-old woman in her car and pinning
the crane's operator.
   Evelyn Thompson was in stable condition Wednesday night after
being trapped more than an hour, and the operator was quickly
freed, Gainesville police Lt. Sadie Darnell said.

   Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece was
moved to a north London hospital Thursday for a heart operation to
be performed by Britain's leading heart specialist, the Greek
Embassy said.
   It will be up to the surgeon, Dr. Magdi Yacoub, to decide when
the prime minister will undergo the operation to narrow of his
aorta, said an embassy spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said Papandreou was moved from from St. Thomas' Hospital in
southeast London, where he has been since Aug. 25, to Harefield
Hospital, where Egyptian-born Yacoub, a pioneer in the field of
organ transplants, performs most of his surgery.
   ``He's really well. According to his doctor, his condition is
very good,'' said the spokesman.
   Papandreou flew to London from Greece on Aug. 25 for tests to
determine his condition.

   Chances of finding an underwater

Thursday.
   Spokesman Thomas Gur said the first indication of underwater

Aug. 27.
   The Swedish government has refused to name who it suspects of
repeatedly violating its territorial waters. But defense experts

   Stockholm newspapers quoted Vitali Ivanov, commander of the
Soviet Baltic fleet, as denying Soviet submarines violated Swedish

   The Irish government refused entry to
Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and was heavily influenced by its
ambassador to Berlin, who said the Jews were a source of
corruption, according to a new book.
   ``Ireland and Europe 1919-1949,'' by historian Dermot Keogh of
University College, Cork, cites previously secret state documents
to show that the government regarded Jews as ``a potential irritant
in the body politic'' who had ``disproportionate wealth and
influence.''
   The book, published Wednesday, says Eamon de Valera, Irish prime
minister at the time, was advised by his ambassador to Germany,
Charles Bewley, a former ambassador to the Vatican and a Roman
Catholic convert from Quakerism.
   He cites reports in the state archives in which Bewley blamed
Jews for ``the appalling moral degradation'' of pre-Hitler Germany
and claimed that they creates ``grave moral scandals and are a
source of corruption of the populations among which they dwell.''
   Keogh writes that de Valera did not share these views and
frequently would ``deviate substantially'' from the policy. About
150 Jews from Germany were admitted temporarily, he says.
   But he also says de Valera rejected pleas from Irish Jewish
leaders to give refuge to a German Jew who had jumped ship in Cork
in 1939. The Jew ended up in a concentration camp, Keogh writes.
   He says there is evidence that government departments opposed
any entry of Jews even after the Nazis' extermination of Jews
became known. The policy, he says, continued after the war.
   Keough quotes a Justice Department memorandum saying Jews should
be treated less liberally under the immigration law because ``the
wealth and influence of the Jewish community in this country
appears to have increased considerably in recent years and there is
some danger of exciting opposition and controversy if this tendency
continues.''
   Even in 1953, a Justice Department memorandum referred to Jews
as a people who ``appear to have disproportionate wealth and
influence,'' Keogh writes.
   Ireland, a country of 3.5 million, has about 1,900 Jews.

   Aspiring principals for the first time will
not be required to have teaching experience, under a new state
policy.
   Educators said the policy makes New Jersey the first state to
open the principal's office to non-teachers.
   The plan, approved Wednesday by New Jersey's Board of Education,
increases standards for all candidates but drops a requirement of
three years' teaching experience.
   The plan will allow the new principals to get teaching
experience as they go.
   ``These new standards create a rigorous procedure for preparing
all future principals and, at the same time, open up the system so
that local districts can select the best potential candidates,
regardless of background,'' Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman
said in a statement after the board meeting in Jamesburg.
   Principals without education backgrounds will be designated as
being part of a ``pilot project.'' It is to be reviewed by an
independent panel in four years, Education Department spokesman
Roger Shatzkin said.
   During that period, the state will allow the hiring of no more
than 50 new principals who lack teaching background, he said. The
applicants will be required to have a master's degree in
management, however.
   Principals with less than a year of teaching experience will
have to teach one class period a day for at least a year, and
candidates with less than a yer of teaching experience will have to
teach for two years.
   In addition, they will be required to complete 135 hours of
graduate study in education during their one- to two-year residency.
   Cooperman said the changes will give New Jersey schools a wider
and better field from which to choose principals.
   Chris Pipho, a spokesman in Denver for the Education Commission
of the States, which follows school policies across the country,
said he knows of no other state that allows non-teachers to be
principals.

<HEAD>Pope Pointedly Avoiding South Africa In Latest Papal Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's latest trip to southern
Africa will take him to an impoverished region of refugees and
rebels, but he will pointedly avoid segregated South Africa, the
region's economic powerhouse.
   The pope leaves Saturday on his fourth trip to Africa and his
39th abroad. He will go to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland
and Mozambique, countries that vehemently oppose South Africa but
depend on it for economic survival.
   South Africa dominates communications, trade, transportation and
politics in southern Africa, and its influence will be felt
strongly during the pope's 10-day trip.
   South African firms are supplying such items as transportation,
food, water and health services, broadcasting and emergency
equipment and even papal souvenirs to be used on many of the pope's
stops.
   John Paul, 68, has been critical of South African apartheid
throughout his nearly 10-year-long pontificate.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro said the pope has not refused
to visit South Africa and he may visit in the future. ``But neither
all the local bishops nor the pope himself consider this an
opportune moment,'' he said.
   Navarro said any South Africa stopover during this visit would
``lose the pastoral tone of the trip.''
   His trip will allow the Vatican to explore new opportunities for
the Roman Catholic Church elsewhere in the region. Orthodox Marxism
is weakening, and communist countries like Mozambique have decided
to return confiscated church properties and to tolerate religious
education. Catholicism has experienced its most rapid recent growth
in Africa.
   John Paul plans to jump immediately into the troubled area with
a keynote address Saturday evening to the bishops of the region,
who are meeting in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.
   Officials say about 6 million refugees have been displaced in
the area by fierce fighting in the former Portuguese colonies of
Angola and Mozambique and regional conflicts in other southern
African nations.
   The United States has been sponsoring peace talks on southern
Africa that would bring independence to Namibia, a pullout of South
African troops from that country and a gradual withdrawal of about
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   On the Indian Ocean coast, a 13-year-old civil war in Mozambique
has turned into a disaster, devastating the countryside, halting
agriculture and starving millions of people. It has caused a human
tidal wave of almost 1 million refugees fleeing to camps in
Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Malawi and South Africa.
   The conflict pits the Mozambican National Resistance Movement _
a group that says it is anti-communist _ against Mozambique's
Marxist government. The State Department estimates 100,000
civilians have been killed in the past two years.
   Throughout his visit, John Paul will meet refugees and maimed
victims of the regional conflicts.
   He also will visit the dioceses of Gaborone in Botswana and
Manzini in Swaziland, which are directly dependent on South African
bishops. In Lesotho, more than 1 million South Africans are
expected to cross into the country when the pope beatifies French
missionary Joseph Gerard in a step toward sainthood.
   The king of Lesotho, Moshoeshoe II, is Catholic, as is 40
percent of its 1.8 million population. The visit to Lesotho, one of
the world's poorest countries, is expected to be financed by South
African donations.
   At his first stop in Zimbabwe, John Paul will be greeted by
President Robert Mugabe, a Jesuit-educated Marxist who often has
spoken about his own Catholicism and who received church backing
when he was fighting Rhodesia's white rulers in the 1970s.
   The church has spoken out against alleged atrocities by Mugabe's
soldiers in their conflict against dissidents once headed by Joshua
Nkomo. Nkomo's loyalists made peace last December and joined the
government.
   In diamond-rich Botswana early next week, John Paul will be
greeted by President Quett Masire, who is recovering from injuries
incurred when his plane was mistakenly shot down by Angolan troops
while on his way a month ago to a conference in Angola.
   At midweek, the pope will be in Lesotho for the religious
centerpiece of the trip _ the beatification of Father Gerard, whose
grave has become a pilgrimage site.
   After an eight-hour stop in Swaziland on Sept. 16 and a meeting
with 20-year-old King Mswati III, the pope flies to Mozambique,
where he will visit embattled Beira and Nampula, accompanied by the
country's first cardinal, Alexandre dos Santos, who has urged
government dialogue with the guerrillas.
   Because of guerrilla activity, access to Nampula is considered
relatively safe only by air.

   A 23-year-old Briton today broke the speed
record for swimming the English Channel from France to England,
making the crossing in just over eight hours.
   Richard Davey, a chemical engineer from Folkestone, swam in calm
seas and clear weather from Cap Griz Nez, France, to St. Margaret's
Bay near Dover, England, in eight hours and five minutes.
   He cut by 10 minutes the record for a crossing from France to
England set by Philip Rush of New Zealand last year.
   The fastest swim for a channel crossing in either direction was
set in 1978 by Penny Lee Dean of the United States, while swimming
from England to France in seven hours, 40 minutes.
   The distance from Dover in a straight line to the nearest point
in France is 21 miles, but winds, tides and currents usually add 10
miles or more to the distance for swimmers.
   Davey, an experienced long-distance swimmer, failed by 57
seconds on Saturday to break the all-time record for a crossing of
the 10.5-mile long Lake Windermere in northeastern England. He made
the crossing in three hours, 50 minutes, and 53 seconds.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, who has concentrated on

   The Republican vice presidential candidate, in remarks prepared
for delivery to the City Club of Chicago, also said that Japan and
the European allies should share more of the cost of their own
defense.
   On SDI, Quayle said, ``The next president should make every
effort to determine whether he or his successor could develop and
deploy a second red button _ not just the button of retaliation but
the button of protection.''
   The speech was designed to spotlight Quayle's experience as a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He spoke in great
detail on the justifications for SDI, popularly known as Star Wars,
as well as other weapons systems and national security philosophy
in general.
   He called for a cautious approach to U.S.-Soviet agreements.
``We must probe the Soviet position on START, working to conclude
an agreement while modernizing our forces,'' he said.
   ``We must probe the Soviet position on conventional forces while
continuing initiatives to strengthen our conventional force
posture. And we must probe Soviet willingness to restrain their
clients and to determine whether Soviet `new thinking' will in fact
lead to behavior that can lower the possibilities for regional
conflicts,'' he said in the prepared statement.
   Quayle's text did not mention Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, whom he has heatedly attacked as being weak on
defense in recent days.
   He attacked congressional ``interference in the president's
ability to conduct foreign policy.'' He said the War Powers Act
``is unconstitutional and should be repealed or drastically
rewritten.''
   The act, enacted by Congress in 1973 over President Nixon's
veto, is a Vietnam-era law limiting a president's ability to commit
U.S. troops to dangerous situations.
   The law says a president must send a report to Congress within
48 hours after U.S. military personnel are sent to areas of
``imminent hostilities.'' The forces would have to be withdrawn in
60 days, in some cases, unless Congress votes to permit them to
stay.
   All presidents since Nixon have argued the law is an
unconstitutional restriction on the executive branch.
   There is widespread criticism _ from Democrats and Republicans
alike _ that the law is unworkable and there is now a bipartisan
push to rewrite the law, although there is not yet agreement on
details.
   On Wednesday in Washington, Quayle got a warm welcome from his
colleagues his first day back on the job since becoming George
Bush's running mate, but the message from Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole was mixed at best.
   Dole praised Quayle as ``a rising young star in our party'' at a
Capitol reception, but later he stopped short of calling Quayle an
asset to the Republican ticket when pressed by reporters.
   ``I think he's becoming an asset,'' Dole said. Did that mean the
senator thought Quayle had achieved that status yet, he was asked.
``Becoming,'' Dole repeated.
   Quayle told his GOP colleagues, ``I can't wait to get back out
there'' on the campaign trail. There were cheers from the senators
as Quayle spoke, some of them calling out, ``Hear, Hear!''
   ``No matter what happens in this election, the people who know
me best and the people I am closest to are the people right here in
this room,'' Quayle said. ``I hope you never forget. Believe me,
I'll never forget.''
   Quayle said he would return to Washington for key Senate votes
as he was needed.
   ``I know you've been on a roller coaster ride,'' Dole said as he
welcomed the Indiana senator back after a summer recess in which
Quayle became the party's vice presidential nominee.
   Since his nomination, Quayle has been dogged by controversies
over his military service, personal life and academic record, and
some in his own party have expressed skepticism about whether the
41-year-old senator should be on the ticket.
   Dole, a onetime presidential hopeful who was on George Bush's
short list of vice presidential prospects, has himself expressed
reservations about Quayle. Dole said recently that people of his
generation might have problems with allegations that Quayle used
his wealthy family's influence to get into the National Guard
during the Vietnam War.
   He repeated that view after the reception Wednesday, telling
reporters, ``If he did get certain breaks ... that would create a
problem in the minds of many, particularly, I would say, in my
generation.''
   At the reception, Dole presented Quayle with a small fire
extinguisher, which he said Quayle could ``spray on the press from
time to time.''
   He also gave Quayle a framed copy of the Pledge of Allegiance.
The Republicans have criticized Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee, for vetoing a Massachusetts bill that would
have required teachers to lead students in the pledge. Quayle
devoted his Labor Day fall campaign kickoff speech to the pledge.

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a trial to decide who owns the
papers of Martin Luther King Jr. _ his widow or Boston University.
   In a ruling received by lawyers today, Superior Court Judge John
L. Murphy said a letter by King bequeathing the papers to BU is not
a formal will and therefore Coretta Scott King has the right to a
trial on her claim to the documents.
   Murphy ruled that BU was the rightful holder of the papers at
the time of King's death in 1968, but he said Mrs. King also has
the right to stake a claim.
   One issue in the trial, Murphy said, will be whether her 23-year
delay in making a claim strengthens the university's case.
   Murphy rejected a counterclaim by BU to ownership of King papers
stored in Atlanta. The decision was dated Aug. 31.
   At issue is the collection of 83,000 documents entrusted to BU
by King in 1964, four years before he was assassinated in Memphis.
Mrs. King sued in December after negotiations over her bid to
reclaim the papers broke down.
   Mrs. King wants to consolidate the papers with 100,000 other
King documents at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in
Atlanta.
   Central to the case is a one-page, typewritten letter dated July
16, 1964, from King to the BU library.
   King, who received his doctorate in theology from BU in 1955,
wrote that the library would be ``the repository of my
correspondence, manuscripts and other papers.''
   ``In the event of my death,'' he wrote, ``all such materials
deposited with the university shall become from that date the
absolute property of Boston University.''
   Mrs. King, however, claims her husband had privately indicated
his wish that the archive be stored permanently in the South.

   Some 200 West Coast disciples of Bhagwan
Shree Rajneesh are expected for a weekend reunion at their former
central Oregon commune, a spokesman for the Indian guru said.
   State police patrols are being increased in anticipation.
   ``We are not expecting trouble. We plan on being prepared for
trouble if it occurs,'' State Police Maj. John Collins said
Wednesday.
   But the reunion is ``just what we're calling it, a reunion,''
said Swami Anand Vibhavan, spokesman for the Rajneesh Press Service
in Lake Oswego.
   The reunion, by invitation only, will be on private property at
the 64,000-acre Rancho Rajneesh and will be closed to the public
except for a news conference Sunday by Swami Prem Niren, the guru's
attorney who now carries the title of Rajneesh's ambassador to the
United States.
   When the commune was its most active, thousands of red-clad
disciples lived on the ranch, incorporated as Rajneeshpuram. There,
they showered the self-proclaimed ``rich man's guru'' with
Rolls-Royces and jewelry.
   The sect members spent a turbulent 4{ years at the commune that
were marked by confrontations with non-believers.
   Rajneeshees took over the nearby town of Antelope and later, in
an alleged bid for political control of the county, bused in
thousands of transients as potential voters. Sect members boycotted
the election and deposited the transients in nearby communities
after state officials required eligibility hearings for all new
voter registration applicants.
   Rajneesh's feisty personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela, is in
federal prison on a variety of convictions stemming from her
conduct at the commune. Among other crimes, she was convicted of
poisoning salad bars in nearby The Dalles, causing more than 750
people to become ill; giving glasses of poisoned water to county
officials, and setting fire to the county planning office.
   Rajneesh, 56, returned to India in 1985 after pleading guilty to
federal immigration charges. As part of a plea agreement, he
received a suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $400,000 fine and
agreed not to return to the United States for five years without
the written permission of the U.S. attorney general.
   He now lectures and meditates at a commune in Pune, India.
   The commune disbanded after the guru's departure. The property
is scheduled for auction next month under foreclosure proceedings.
   Wasco County residents have expressed concern about the weekend
gathering, but Sheriff Art Labrousse said he expects no trouble.
``We're just going to be business as usual,'' he said.

Disaster</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 25th annual National Championship Air
Races next week are expected to attract record crowds despite the
tragic crash into a German air show audience.
   The possibility of a similar disaster is remote here because of
strict Federal Aviation Administration and air race rules,
according to Thornton Audrain, executive director of the Reno Air
Racing Association.
   ``The planes are not allowed to fly toward the crowd,'' he said
Wednesday. ``In fact, they are only allowed to fly parallel to and
away from the crowd. We've always been very safety conscious and
have never had any spectators injured.'' Eight participants have
been killed, however.
   Audrain said he expects attendance this year to at least match
the record 148,000 who flocked to Stead Airport 10 miles north of
Reno in 1987. Time trials for the various classes of airplanes
begin Monday, and the races are Sept. 15-18.
   A record field of nearly 120 entrants is expected to compete at
speeds of up to more than 450 mph for a total purse of $450,000,
according to race officials. Entrants range from independently
wealthy flying buffs to corporate sponsored pilots.
   The Air Force Thunderbirds also are scheduled to demonstrate
their precision moves, and stunt pilots will entertain between
races.
   ``People expect the stunt flying. It's part of the show,''
Audrain said.
   At Ramstein Air Force Base in West Germany, more than 50 people
died after three jets from an Italian military precision flying
team collided at an air show Aug. 28 and one hurtled into a crowd
of spectators, exploding into a fireball.
   ``That type of maneuver would never be permitted under our
rules,'' Audrain said. ``It would have to be a very, very unusual
circumstance for the audience to be at risk at all. I just don't
see it happening.
   ``We have insurance, although that wouldn't prevent an
accident,'' he added.
   The air races began in 1964 with 24 entrants competing for a
purse of $31,774. Since 1966, the event has attracted many of the
best racers and stunt fliers in the world.
   The eight participant deaths during the history of the race
included one just last year, a pilot whose plane crashed after an
apparent engine malfunction.
   ``We have had some deaths associated with the races, but all in
all we've had a very good safety record,'' Audrain said. ``Some
things you just can't prevent, but with the strict FAA rules, we
think we're as safe as you can get.''

   The 1.9 million-member National Education
Association endorsed presidential candidate Michael Dukakis on
Thursday, with its chief predicting the Democrat would spend more
on schools and end ``eight years of teacher bashing.''
   NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell said she aims to ``mobilize
at least a half-million NEA members to be volunteers in the Dukakis
campaign.''
   The union sent out mail ballots to the 8,479 delegates who
attended its last convention, and got responses from about 6,200.
Dukakis was the choice of 86 percent; the other 14 percent marked
their ballots for Republican nominee George Bush.
   Four years ago, 88 percent backed Walter Mondale in an up-down
vote on the Democratic nominee. The NEA did not show Ronald Reagan
on its ballot that year.
   Futrell, joined by Roseanne Bacon, president of the
Massachusetts Teachers Association, told a news conference she
looks forward to ``substantial increases in federal funding for
public education'' in a Dukakis administration.
   She said Dukakis will ``work side by side with the education
community to improve American education'' and expressed confidence
that he will ``redirect national priorities and provide substantial
increases in federal funding for public education.''
   ``Mike Dukakis, as president, would put an end to eight years of
teacher bashing and budget cutting,'' she said, and ``appoint an
education secretary who would fight for education instead of
trashing it.''
   ``I think that Ronald Reagan and George Bush will go down as the
administration with the worst educational record probably in the
history of America,'' said Futrell.
   The union has been encamped in the Democrats' corner in every
presidential race since 1976.
   Futrell said 30 percent, or nearly 600,000, of her members are
registered Republicans.
   But in rejecting Bush, she said, teachers were signalling that
``they are tired of being beaten on the head, tired of being told
to do more with less.''
   Bush belatedly replied to an NEA political questionnaire two
weeks ago, a year late and long after the ballots went out.

   Discovery's astronauts completed a
successful practice countdown aboard the spaceship today, the last
major test before they lift off in as little as three weeks on the
first shuttle mission in 2{ years, NASA said.
   The space agency on Wednesday plans to announce a launch date
after assessing the countdown test and other factors. Officials
have been discussing a date between Sept. 26 and 29.
   ``We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count
for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the
month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director Forrest S. McCartney told
the launch team after the test.
   ``It certainly sets the stage for what we're about ready to do
here in just a few weeks,'' launch director Bob Sieck added.
   Commander Rick Hauck and his four crewmates, wearing new partial
pressure suits, switched dials, tested communications, monitored
systems and followed all procedures scheduled during the final two
hours of an actual countdown.
   ``Everything appears to have gone quite well,'' said launch
control commentator Hugh Harris as the test concluded at 10:34
a.m., 34 minutes behind schedule because of minor communications
problems between the craft and control center.
   The countdown clock was halted at six seconds before the mock
liftoff to simulate an engine problem and give the launch team
practice in making the vehicle safe.
   Harris said that had this been an actual launch attempt, the
effort would have been delayed because winds of about 19 mph were
too high. Because it was a practice, launch director Bob Sieck gave
the go-ahead to complete the count.
   ``It all looks clean; it all looks good,'' Hauck said after an
inspection of Discovery on Tuesday. ``We're going to be ready to
fly.''
   The other crewmen are pilot Dick Covey and mission specialists
George Nelson, Mike Lounge and Dave Hilmers.
   On most previous shuttle launches, the astronauts wore flight
coveralls. The partial pressure suits, to be worn on launch and
re-entry, would be necessary in case of trouble during an emergency
landing attempt and the crew had to bail out by blowing an
explosive hatch, sliding down a telescoping pole and parachuting to
Earth.
   The emergency escape system has been added since the Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger explosion that killed the seven-member crew and
grounded the shuttle fleet. It would not help in a Challenger-type
accident in which the vehicle blew apart 73 seconds after liftoff.
   The practice countdown concludes three days of training here for
the astronauts, after which they return to their base at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston to await a launch day announcement
next week.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is aiming for
a liftoff in the last week in September, but has deferred setting a
firm date until Sept. 14, following a two-day flight readiness
review here.
   Hauck said he and Lounge would represent the crew at the review.
   ``That is an in-depth review that all elements of the program
will have a requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that
their part of the program is ready for us to fly,'' he told
reporters Wednesday.
   Asked if he saw anything that would prevent a late September
launch, the commander replied, ``I haven't seen anything.''
   He said there were a few open technical issues, but he did not
consider any of them serious.
   The astronauts met reporters Tuesday following a three-hour
launch pad exercise in which they inspected Discovery and the
communications satellite in its cargo bay and walked through a
rehearsal of emergency escape procedures.
   Hauck commanded Discovery in November 1984 on one of the ship's
six earlier flights. The four other crewmen also are veteran
shuttle fliers.

<HEAD>Leftist Insurgency Could Lead To Civil War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE GONZALES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centuries of hate and discrimination between
Peru's rich and poor have spawned a vicious leftist insurgency that
could lead to civil war, the head of a blue-ribbon Senate panel on
violence warned Thursday.
   ``Either we make a concerted effort at a national plan for
pacification ... or face the possibility of a country caught in a
civil war,'' Sen. Enrique Bernales said in making public the
commission's report.
   Poverty, racism and government corruption are other major causes
of the eight-year insurrection of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla
group, said the study, conducted by a panel of 11 senators.
   ``Political violence in Peru is not the result of poverty alone
but of humiliation, oppression, hate between classes, racism,''
Bernales said.
   Bernales said the 389-page report, which probes the roots of
violence and offers possible solutions, is the most extensive of
its kind ever undertaken in Peru.
   The commission said the white ruling class has maintained the
subjugation of Indian peasants in the Andean highlands first begun
by Spanish conquerors and continued by the aristocracy.
   It said the peasants, who make up about 40 percent of Peru's
population, are the most uneducated, impoverished and ignored
sector of society and are frequent objects of scorn.
   ``This has become an intolerable humiliation. They are being
pushed to the border and are questioning the existing order.
Violence has resulted,'' the report said.
   The commission, which used government and private studies in its
findings, said 11,605 people have been killed and property damage
has reached $10 billion in the Maoist revolt.
   The panel said that the economy also has deteriorated
dramatically.
   ``The country is in the same situation as it was 15 years ago.
It has lost all movement toward developing,'' said Bernales.
   Mounting problems have sparked an exodus of skilled workers and
professionals. The report said 125,000 Peruvians emigrated in the
past four years, about half to the United States.
   In a nationwide survey, which sampled residents of the
terror-ridden mountain states of Ayacucho and Huancavelica for the
first time ever, the commission found 60 percent of Peru's 20
million people believe the government has been ineffective in
dealing with terrorism.
   The commission said the insurgency, repressive countermeasures
by government forces and drug trafficking have sparked political
instability and undermined participation in Peru's democracy.
   About 300,000 Peruvian families are linked to narcotics
trafficking, according to the study. The peasants grow coca, the
raw material of cocaine, on small jungle plots for their livelihood.
   The Shining Path recently opened a new front in the coca-growing
zone. The commission urged greater efforts be made toward feasible
crop substitution programs.
   It also urged government forces to reject illegal tactics in
dealing with guerrillas.
   ``The state and society must stay within the law in defending
itself,'' said Bernales.
   The states of emergency to counter rebels, now in effect in
seven states where more than 40 percent of the population lives,
should be phased out to strengthen respect for democracy, the
commission said.
   The panel recommended a national consensus be reached quickly on
how to resist the guerrillas, and it urged radical changes in
Peru's rigid class structure.
   The commission also proposed that police and the military
undergo training in respecting human rights.

<HEAD>Opponents Of Newspaper Merger Challenge Justice Department
Arguements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge was confronted Thursday with
conflicting arguments over whether to let Detroit's two daily
newspapers complete a partial merger approved last month by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   William Schultz, attorney for a Michigan group of readers and
advertisers opposed to the arrangement, accused owners of the
Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News of cutting prices to put
each other out of business or eventually qualify for a lucrative
joint operating agreement under the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   But a Justice Department attorney, Thomas Millet, said there was
``absolutely no evidence'' that the two newspapers had colluded.
   The arrangement approved by Meese before he left office would
allow the morning Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder, Inc., to
merge its commercial and business operations with the News, bought
in 1986 by Gannett Co.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close the Free Press, which has
sustained $100 million in losses in nine years, if the partial
merger is not allowed to proceed.
   The deal was temporarily blocked by court order last month to
give U.S. District Judge George Revercomb a chance to consider the
legal challenge by Michigan Citizens for a Free Press.
   Revercomb said he would rule next week on the group's request
for an injunction barring the merger.
   The Michigan group of readers and advertisers charges that the
two newspapers set out to try to put each other out of business by
cutting advertising and circulation rates or to qualify for a joint
operating agreement.
   ``Knight-Ridder's strategy was to sustain short-term losses with
its eye on very long-term profits'' under a joint operating
agreement allowed by the law's anti-trust exemption, Schultz said.
   Schultz argued that Meese's decision to allow the partial merger
was arbitrary because he ignored the administrative law judge's
conclusion that if the merger were not approved, the News, which
has also posted significant losses, would eventually raise its
prices, thereby allowing the Free Press to do the same.
   Millet said ``there was absolutely no evidence of collusion''
between the Free Press and the News, which was not acquired by
Gannett until several months before the merger application was made
in 1986.
   ``The fact that these two papers considered the option and
discused this over a period of time is not an argument that a JOA
shouldn't occur,'' Millet said.
   Such discussions were a ``natural consequence'' of the losses
the two papers continued to suffer while waging the cutthroat
newspaper war, he said.
   Clark Clifford, an attorney representing Knight-Ridder, said the
News rejected several overtures from the Free Press about forming a
joint operating agreement.
   ``The News' answer was always: `There is the door. Good-bye.'''
said Clifford, an elder statesmen of the Democratic Party and a
Knight-Ridder director.
   While the Free Press was locked in bitter competition with the
News, ``every year except one, they lost more money than they lost
the year before,'' Clifford said.
   Clifford said 2200 jobs would be lost if the Free Press closed
its doors, compared to 600 to 800 lost positions under the proposed
merger.
   In 1987, the Free Press had a circulation of 639,720 daily and
724,342 on Sundays. The News' circulation was 678,720 daily and
839,319 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.

   The American Legion on Thursday elected
its first national commander who is a veteran of the Vietnam War.
   Legionnaires said the election of H.F. ``Sparky'' Gierke, 45, of
Watford City, N.D., is a way to attract younger veterans to the
world's largest organization of veterans.
   Gierke, a North Dakota Supreme Court justice, was a full-time
military judge in Vietnam. He was discharged in April 1971.
   Gierke, who was not opposed, was elected by acclamation at the
legion's 70th annual convention.
   Gierke succeeds John P. ``Jake'' Comer of Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Korea Urged to Release Political Prisoners, End Torture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Korea has made significant improvements in
human rights as it prepares to host the Olympics, but the
government still holds 600 political prisoners and tortures some of
them, Amnesty International said Thursday.
   The human rights group said in a report that some political
prisoners were jailed after unfair trials but that torture has
decreased.
   Government sensitivity to world attention during the Sept. 17 to
Oct. 2 Olympics may help improve the situation, but the Games do
not guarantee changes, a representative of the London-based group
said.
   ``The limits of freedom of expression have expanded ... the
atmosphere is remarkably more free than before,'' Amnesty
International researcher Francoise Vandale said at a briefing on
the report, entitled ``Detention of Prisoners of Conscience and
Torture Continue.''
   The report said South Korea should release more political
prisoners, end torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and change
laws to allow peaceful expression of opposition to the government.
   Major political changes since last summer have ushered in some
improvements in human rights, the report noted.
   The government of President Roh Tae-woo came to power after Roh,
then chairman of the governing party, pledged democratic reforms,
including release of political prisoners, in response to violent
demonstrations in June 1987.
   National Assembly elections last April gave the opposition a
majority, a startling change for a country long ruled by a party
with almost complete power.
   The assembly is debating several changes in laws on national
security and demonstrations, and Amnesty International called for
amendments ``to exclude from their scope peaceful acts of
opposition to the government.''
   The changes have given political prisoners limited hope. ``There
have been releases and amnesties but we think they've been too
few,'' Ms. Vandale said.
   The government says nearly 1,300 political prisoners have been
released since last year, but Amnesty International says the number
is only 400.
   The organization also said 4,000 former political prisoners'
civil rights have been restored in this period, about half the
number claimed by the government.
   ``Arrests on political grounds have continued,'' with about 600
people imprisoned for political or trade union activities, the
report said.
   Of these, about one-third have been convicted, as far back as
1958, for anti-state activities such as espionage, and given
sentences from five years to life.
   Another one-third were arrested during nationwide strikes in
1987, and the rest are thought to be students arrested in the past
year during anti-government demonstrations.
   Among the 600, Amnesty International is calling for the release
of 28 it has adopted as prisoners of conscience, and it is
investigating the cases of another 70.
   Amnesty International defines prisoners of conscience as those
``detained for belief, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or
religion provided they haven't used or advocated violence.''
Students who threw rocks in demonstrations could not be considered,
an official said.
   Constitutional amendments have strenthened laws protecting
prisoners' rights, but ``in practice these rights are still not
always respected,'' Amnesty International said.
   It said relatives and lawyers have been denied access to any
information about detainees, and prisoners have been isolated,
beaten and deprived of sleep in the first days after their arrest.
   The group has not heard of water torture cases since several
instances in the last two years in which police were arrested for
torture or abuse of a detainee.
   Asked if Amnesty International felt the government was making
changes with the Olympics in mind, the researcher said, ``I suppose
the government is sensitive to its political image, but I believe
the release of political prisoners has more to do with the balance
of political parties.''
   She said that in the long term, ``of course the attention of the
whole world matters ... but things have changed very quickly in
Korea. We just don't know what might happen after (the Games.)''

   About 60 Panamanian refugees were stranded here
Thursday after the Canadian government abruptly began demanding
entry visas for travelers from that strife-torn nation, a U.S.
immigration official said.
   ``These people do not want to return to Panama _ they have made
that clear,'' Perry Rivkind, district director of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service here, said Thursday.
   Rivkind said that among the Panamanians are more than 20
children. The Panamanians were housed overnight by the airlines,
and on Thursday were given temporary permission to stay in the
United States until their situation is revolved, he said.
   ``It all rests with Canada,'' Rivkind said. ``That policy should
not have been changed in midstream.'' He said he had requested the
U.S. State Department to complain to Canadian officials about the
situation.
   On Wednesday, Canadian Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall
announced that, effective immediately, Panamanians could no longer
enter the country with only a valid passport.
   She said the visa requirement was necessary to preserve the
integrity of the Canadian immigration system, adding that 1,600
Panamanians have asked for refugee status this year.
   Panama has been wracked with political and economic turmoil
since its military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was indicted
for drug trafficking in February. The United States has declared a
financial embargo against Panama in a so-far unsuccessful effort to
topple Noriega's government.
   The stranded Panamanians arrived on Delta Air Lines and Air
Canada flights in the past two days with U.S. transit visas, which
ordinarily would allow them to stay only long enough to catch
another flight on to Canada.
   But they were informed that Canada now demands entry visas for
Panamanians, and were prohibited from boarding flights to that
country.
   He said that an additional 15 Panamanians were stranded in New
York.
   So far, the Panamanians stranded here have expressed no desire
to stay in the United States permanently, Rivkind said.
   Should the situation drag out, the INS, which usually refuses to
change transit visas to U.S. entry visas, might make an exception,
Rivkind said.
   ``I would have to weigh the implications,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Wind gusts to 85 mph
fanned forest fires that gutted 17 buildings near Old Faithful,
while two Montana men reported missing after flames engulfed their
home were found today.
   ``Trees were just popping like matchsticks,'' said Robert Lee, a
firefighter from Auburn, Ala. ``There were winds at least 85 mph.''
   Temperatures here dropped into the 30s and winds died down
overnight, and firefighters expected calmer weather through
Saturday. Forecasters said a storm could bring rain or snow over
the weekend.
   Wildfires also forced the evacuations of 50 homes in the
Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming east of Yellowstone and two
dozen homes and a Boy Scout camp near Boulder and Golden, Colo.
Fire crews continued to protect two Montana towns near Yellowstone
from a huge fire, and battled blazes in Idaho, California, Oregon,
Washington and Utah.
   In northwest Montana along the Flathead River, authorities had
feared that a man and his brother were caught in the flames after
refusing an evacuation order.
   But the men were found this morning along the river corridor
bordering Glacier National Park.
   ``They have been located and they are all right,'' said Madelyn
Kempf, fire information officer.
   Although federal officials have called this the worst fire
season in 30 years, no fatalities have been directly attributed to
the blazes, which have charred 3.65 million acres, an area larger
than Connecticut.
   Last month, a helicopter involved in battling a blaze in
Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest crashed after losing power,
killing a passenger, a Bureau of Land Management technician.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., and others have criticized the Park
Service for waiting too long to fight some of the fires because of
a policy to allow fires in wilderness areas to burn for the
benefits they bring to forests.
   Wallop met Wednesday with Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel and
urged William Penn Mott, director of the National Park Service, to
resign.
   The northwest Montana blaze, discovered Tuesday, expanded to an
estimated 7,500 acres by early today and moved into Glacier
National Park, where it burned a ranger station complex and
numerous cabins.
   Four hikers near the park's Lower Quartz Lake were rescued by
helicopter Wednesday afternoon after flames cut off their escape
route and they drove their vehicle into the lake to save it.
   More than 100 people who live in the area were evacuated, and
two park campgrounds were evacuated.
   At Yellowstone, tourist Ken Miller of Denver was one of more
than 100 visitors who left the Old Faithful area in a convoy led by
rangers Wednesday night as embers from the nearby 221,800-acre
North Fork fire descended.
   ``I've been coming up here a long time,'' Miller said. ``Thank
God I've got a lot of pictures of the way the park was, because
I'll never see it like that again.''
   The fire is one of 13 major blazes covering more than 1 million
acres in and around the 2.2 million-acre park.
   Earlier, flames destroyed two cabins in the complex's southern
end, while embers carried by the winds ignited 14 guest cabins and
a utility shed at the main part of the complex, said Fire Commander
Denny Bungarz.
   But because the fire exhausted fuel as it passed through,
officials did not expect to see similar damaging flames again.
   About 200 firefighters protected other structures, including the
historic Old Faithful Inn, where a sprinkler line on the roof was
activated. Firefighters also sprayed flame-retardant foam on the
roof.
   Overnight visitors to Old Faithful were asked to leave Wednesday
morning. It was the first-ever evacuation of the most popular
tourist attraction at the 116-year-old park in Wyoming's northwest
corner.
   But park officials admitted day visitors until late Wednesday
afternoon, when stiff winds whipped up a blaze on the area's
southern border and blew embers into the complex, igniting roofs of
buildings.
   ``When that firestorm went through there, we had to move our
people out of there,'' Bungarz said. ``When you can feel the heat
inside your car, it's time to move.''
   East of Yellowstone, Shoshone forest officials evacuated at
least 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely populated area
because of rapid growth of the 260,000-acre Clover Mist fire.
   But the National Weather Service said a storm front could carry
significant rain or even snow for Wyoming this weekend, providing
relief.
   Along Yellowstone's northern border, high winds drove a backfire
along the northern edge of Cooke City and nearby Silver Gate. The
fire singed the fringes of the Montana towns but created a buffer
of charred timber in advance of the 119,000-acre Storm
Creek-Hellroaring fire.
   ``Now, with the fuels burned out, at least on this side of the
valley, there won't be anything left to burn,'' said Bill Stalker,
a fire information officer.
   However, officials remained concerned that winds could shift and
drive the main fire into dry, unburned timber south of the canyon
towns by this weekend. The blaze remained about a mile from the
towns Wednesday, officials said.
   Firefighters sprayed foam on buildings in Cooke Pass, 2{ miles
east of Cooke City, and saved about 40 structures before the
searing flames drove crews out.

   Four white supremacists have pleaded guilty
to federal charges they plotted bombings, robberies and other
crimes to further their beliefs.
   The two Coeur d'Alene couples entered the pleas Wednesday night
after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors. The couples,
David and Deborah Dorr and Edward and Olive Hawley, were scheduled
to go on trial Monday.
   The Feb. 12 indictment accused them of committing a series of
crimes in the Coeur d'Alene area in August and September 1986 aimed
at advancing their white-supremacist group, Bruder Schweigen Strike
Force II, or Order II.
   Besides raising money to finance its operations, the group
sought to kill or intimidate opponents of their offshoot of the
Church of Jesus Christ Christian-Aryan Nations, prosecutors said.
   They were accused of bombing an auto restoration shop, the home
of a priest who was a leader in anti-hate group activity, and the
federal building Coeur d'Alene.
   Prosecutors alleged the explosions were part of an aborted plan
to rob a bank and a National Guard armory.
   All four pleaded guilty to racketeering or engaging in a
continuing criminal enterprise from 1984 to 1987. Some also pleaded
guilty to firearms or explosives charges or counterfeiting.
   Ryan approved an agreement with prosecutors that Dorr be
sentenced to no more than 20 years in prison, Mrs. Dorr to no more
than eight years, Hawley to no more than 12 years and Mrs. Hawley
no more than a suspended six-year term.
   He scheduled sentencing for Oct. 26.
   A fifth defendant, Robert Pires, has pleaded guilty to charges
including a 1986 slaying and bombings and attempted bombings in
Coeur d'Alene. Pires was sentenced to 25 years in prison and has
been cooperating with prosecutors.

   Like mammoth Roman candles, rocket motors
from two Pershing nuclear missiles were burned today, becoming the
first of 867 U.S. missiles to be destroyed under the U.S.-Soviet
intermediate-range arms treaty.
   Hundreds of people, including Vice President George Bush and a
team of Soviet inspectors, watched the static firing, in which the
motors were bolted into a concrete and steel structure, ignited and
allowed to burn up their fuel.
   Bush used binoculars to watch the first 50-second firing at the
8,500-acre Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant. The first Pershing 2
motor burned at 10 a.m., followed 15 minutes later by a 40-second
burning of a lighter Pershing 1A.
   ``This is the day that the two nuclear powers began to move
toward a safer world,'' Bush said.
   Col. Nikolai Chabalin, a senior Soviet inspector, said through
an interpreter: ``We think it is a great event for the Soviet
people, the reduction of two types of nuclear weapons. And today we
have witnessed the fulfillment of a significant event in the
elimination of these weapons under the treaty.''
   ``This is the first elimination of such U.S. missiles under the
INF treaty anywhere, worldwide,'' said Susan Franklin, Washington
spokeswoman for the On-site Inspection Agency, established to help
carry out the arms treaty.
   ``It's interesting,'' said a member of the 12-person Soviet
team, Andire V. Krutskikh of Moscow. ``We have a lot to do,
though.''
   A small group of Michael Dukakis presidential supporters and
other protesters, one of whom carried a sign saying Texans for a
Sane Demilitarization, lined the drive to the arsenal's front gate.
   ``The Soviets watch the motors' static firing to eliminate the
rocket propellant in the motor,'' said Dave Harris of Karnack, a
civilian employee with the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal.
   ``We must then physically disable the rocket motor so the motor
casing could not be reloaded and reused again,'' he said. ``We're
going to do that in a car crusher, squash them in a car crusher.''
   The Soviets arrived here Wednesday. The treaty allows up to 20
such observers.
   ``There's a cast of thousands behind this thing, including many
ambassadors, with people from New York to Russia,'' said Longhorn
spokeswoman Joann Roberts. ``It's exciting.''
   Ms. Franklin said that about nine more rocket motors were
scheduled to be eliminated in the following week at Longhorn, which
is 170 miles east of Dallas.
   Officials also will destroy Pershings and their launchers at
Pueblo Depot Activity near Pueblo, Colo, and Pershing launchers
will be eliminated in West Germany.
   The treaty also provides for destruction of ground-launched
cruise missiles and their launchers at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base
near Tucson, Ariz., said Ms. Franklin.
   The treaty became effective this summer and requires the
superpowers to dismantle and destroy their intermediate- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles. The United States has 867
ground-launched cruise and Pershing missiles scheduled for
destruction.
   As of Aug. 30, the Soviet Union destroyed 22 medium and 50
shorter range missiles. It must destroy a total of 1,752 SS-4,
SS-12 and SS-20 missiles under the treaty.

   A congressman asked a House subcommittee
Thursday to toughen a bill aimed at resuming the availability of
federal land for municipal landfills in the West.
   Without amendments, the bill under consideration leaves the
government ``not doing its fair share to clean up,'' Rep. Mike
Synar, D-Okla., told the national parks and public lands
subcommittee of the House Interior Committee.
   Federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management has
been leased and sold outright for landfills to hundreds of cities,
towns and counties at below-market prices since 1954. The leases
and deeds have contained clauses requiring a return to federal
ownership if the land is used for purposes not stated in the lease.
   This could leave the federal government liable for cleanup if
hazardous materials are found in the landfills, even though those
materials may have been placed there during municipal operation of
the site.
   Robert Burford, director of the bureau, told the subcommittee
the liability was potentially ``enormous,'' but he had no figures.
Because of this potential, he suspended new deals in February 1987.
   Bureau spokesman Bob Johnson said he did not know how many
cities and counties wanted landfills, ``but there is certainly
interest.''
   ``The maintenance of a waste disposal site facility and cleanup
of a hazardous waste site are more properly the responsibility of
the local and state governments and the Environmental Protection
Agency, respectively,'' Burford said.
   Without regular municipal landfills, ``people are going to find
a place'' to put their garbage illegally, he said.
   The environment subcommittee of the Government Operations
Committee, chaired by Synar, said in a report last year that the
bureau was ignoring EPA's guidelines for landfill operations that
federal agencies are obliged to follow, even such provisions as
requiring fences.
   ``Both the delinquent operator and the BLM, by their failure to
act, are responsible for the mess,'' Synar said. ``Now, if BLM just
passes ownership of the sites off to local jurisdictions, it is not
doing its fair share to clean up.''
   Also, he said, ``To apportion the costs and responsibilities of
any future cleanup, BLM needs to know the condition of the site
when it leaves federal ownership.''
   Synar urged the subcommittee to require rigorous inspection
before any land transfers. ``Contaminated land should not be
transferred until the federal government has taken corrective
action to eliminate the hazards,'' he said, urging that the bill
require new owners to agree to abide by all federal and state
hazardous waste regulations.
   There are now 336 active sites subject to the reversion
provision. The Interior Department has estimated that 1,000 to
3,000 sites on its lands have been used for municipal waste
disposal in the past.
   There are 37 federally provided landfills in Arizona, 54 in
California, 16 in Colorado, 41 in Idaho, three in Montana, 44 in
Nevada, 51 in New Mexico, 19 in Oregon, 35 in Utah and 36 in
Wyoming.
   The bill would not disturb any federal liability for existing
hazardous waste, even if not discovered yet. However, it would
enable the interior secretary to lease or sell land in new
transactions without reversion requirements if the land is to be
used for municipal landfills or ``any purpose which may result in
the release of hazardous wastes,'' Burford said.
   BLM has suspended operations at 94 sites, but Bernie Hyde, the
bureau's hazardous waste specialist, said the agency has no idea
how many sites may contain hazardous waste.
   One site in New Mexico has been proposed for the priority
cleanup list for the ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program run
by the EPA, although federal sites may not receive Superfund money,
Hyde said. Inspections are under way at 45 sites, and about a third
of those have been determined to require no action, he added.

   Michael Dukakis' image as a decisive leader has
declined in the past month while George Bush's has improved,
costing Dukakis support among independent voters, a national poll
released Thursday said.
   Bush was supported by 50 percent of all likely voters in the
Business Week poll, to 44 percent for Dukakis. That was a reversal
of their standings in a survey for the magazine done Aug. 4-9,
before the Republican National Convention.
   The new poll of 1,299 likely voters had a margin of error of
three percentage points, putting the race at a statistical dead
heat. However, based on the underlying movement to Bush, ``We feel
he's clearly ahead at this point,'' said David Krane of Louis
Harris & Associates, which conducts the Business Week polls.
   The 50-44 margin in the survey was similar to a 51-43 Bush lead
in an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Wednesday. The
ABC-Post poll was done Aug. 31 through Tuesday; Business Week's,
Sept. 1 through Tuesday.
   Both polls were conducted in part during the Labor Day weekend,
when many people are not home and samples may be less
representative. The Post warned that its results ``should be
interpreted cautiously.'' Krane said he did not believe the
Business Week poll had sampling problems.
   Respondents to the survey expressed some concerns with both
candidates. They split evenly on whether Dukakis is ``too soft on
crime'' and said by a 63-28 percent margin he is too inexperienced
in foreign affairs.
   On the other hand, they said by 51-42 percent that Bush
``demonstrated poor judgment in the way he picked Senator Dan
Quayle as his running mate,'' and agreed by 62-27 that Bush ``is
too willing to defend policies of the Reagan administration, such
as the Iran arms deal, whether they worked or not.''
   Asked who is the more decisive leader, 46 percent picked Bush to
40 percent for Dukakis. In the August poll, it was 50 percent for
Dukakis to 39 percent for Bush. The remainder were not sure.
   Bush had the support of most Republicans and Dukakis was favored
by most Democrats, as in August. But then independents were split,
49 percent for Bush and 46 percent for Dukakis; in the new poll
they went for Bush, 54-39.
   The August poll put the race overall at 51 percent for Dukakis
to 45 percent for Bush.

   An oil well exploded in flames early today,
killing at least one person and seriously burning several others,
the sheriff's office said.
   The identity of the well's owner was not immediately available.
   Chuck Reed, a Tangipahoa Parish sheriff's deputy, said the
person killed may have been a teen-ager who had been riding a
motorcycle near the well. The fire was believed to have been
brought under control before noon, Reed said.
   Cindy Roberts, who owns a convenience and a home near the well,
said, ``I could only see black smoke. I didn't want to go back
there.''
   Tracie Ballard said the ground shook at her service station
about 10 miles from the blast.

<HEAD>Reagan Invites Allied Leaders To New York Meetings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan wants to use a U.N. visit
later this month to hold individual talks with allied leaders, but
is not trying to set up a New York summit, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Deluged with questions about a series of stories suggesting
Reagan was trying to get world leaders together, Fitzwater said the
president merely had invited the leaders of delegations to the U.N.
General Assembly session to see him while he is in New York.
   Saying the president will travel to New York Sept. 26 and
address the General Assembly the next morning, Fitzwater told
reporters that news accounts suggesting a summit was being
attempted were incorrect. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
called one such account ``wildly inaccurate.''
   Fitzwater, answering questions at the daily White House news
briefing, said Reagan will ``hold a number of meetings with heads
of delegations, some on a bilateral basis and some in larger
groups.''
   He confirmed previous reports that Reagan had invited the
foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel to meet with him in New York
to discuss sagging Middle East peace prospects.
   ``In addition the president will meet with foreign ministers or
heads of state from several other countries during the visit,'' the
spokesman said. ``We're not prepared to announce any specific
meetings at this time. However, there are erroneous reports ... of
a so-called meeting of industrialized nations, and that story is
false.''
   Fitzwater said that ``undoubtedly the president will meet either
informally or at lunch and for dinners with representatives from
several countries'' but said that none of these meetings ``can be
construed as summits.''
   ``What's happened is, the president's having a number of
meetings and we have, of course, extended invitations to a number
of heads of delegations for those meetings,'' he said. ``In some
cases, a head of state intends to be the head of the delegation,
and in many cases, it will be the foreign minister.''
   ``I think what's happening is we have sent the invitations,
those countries are reporting it, and then in the process it gets
labeled slightly incorrectly,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Paris today, the office of President Francois Mitterrand said
Reagan had asked him to meet Sept. 27 in New York, and that the
invitation was still ``under study.''
   A spokeswoman at the Elysee Palace, speaking on condition of
anonymity in keeping with the practice on these matters, said she
did not know which other leaders had been invited, but understood
that West Germany would be represented by its foreign minister.
   Mitterrand already is scheduled to meet Reagan at the White
House on Sept. 29.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said there
had been ``a communication'' on the matter to which Mrs. Thatcher
has not yet responded.
   A spokesman for the prime minister, requesting anonymity, said
she had no plans to be in the United States in September. He noted
that Mrs. Thatcher has accepted an invitation extended by Reagan in
May to visit him in Washington after the election and to meet with
whoever wins the election.

   Schools and libraries face growing pressure to
censor the books children read, according to a report released
Thursday by the American Association of School Administrators.
   ``Pressures that could result in censorship are increasing, and
that has an adverse effect on the ability of the schools to provide
a broad-based education for children, who will be our future
leaders,'' said Judith Krug, director of the association's office
for intellectual freedom.
   This pressure comes from people who want to impose their views
on the educational system by removing or restricting use of certain
materials, according to the report, ``Censorship and Selection:
Issues and Answers for Schools.''
   The study was published jointly by the administrators group and
the American Library Association.
   Over the past five years the number of challenges to library
books and school materials increased by 168 percent, the groups
said.
   In many cases, the study says, those seeking to censor materials
see themselves as living in a hostile world, surrounded by enemies
... ``people whose world is filled with `oughts' and `shoulds' and
any indication that other people are freer in their decision-making
processes arouses in them severe feelings of anxiety and
resentment.''
   It is essential that schools reach out to these people before
controversy can arise, the report suggests. Cited as a possible
solution was one case where parents, who had heard reports of
questionable material in some school books, were invited to the
school to read and discuss the books in question.
   The teachers learned things from the parents, while the parents
got to understand the books and came to trust the teachers, the
report said.

<HEAD>Reagan Losing Domestic Policy Aide; Brings Back Former Assistant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House Thursday announced the
resignation of Kenneth T. Cribb as domestic policy adviser to
President Reagan and said he would be succeeded by former aide
Danny Crippen.
   Cribb, a onetime White House associate of then-presidential
counselor Edwin Meese III, went to the Justice Department to serve
as chief of staff to Meese when Meese became attorney general in
early 1985.
   Cribb, 40, returned to the White House last year and had served
as an adviser on a broad range of domestic policy, particularly the
selection of candidates for the federal judiciary, since that time.
   Reagan was to attend a private going-away party for Cribb later
Thursday in the Roosevelt Room.
   At the daily White House news briefing, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater called Cribb a valuable adviser and said he had
operated in the White House as ``a liaison to the conservative
community.''
   Crippen had resigned his White House position as a deputy
assistant to the president on July 31, and had been doing private
consulting work since then, Fitzwater said.
   Crippen, 36, worked on economic, trade policy and related issues
during his earlier White House stint. As Cribb's replacement, he
will address a broader range of domestic policy issues.
   From 1985-87, Crippen was executive director of the Merrill
Lynch Advisory Council and had served as an economics adviser and
chief counsel to then-Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., when Baker was the
Republican leader in the Senate from 1981-84.

<HEAD>Vincennes Skipper Was Told Iranian Plane Might Be Airliner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three minutes before he ordered missiles fired
at the Iranian plane approaching his ship July 3, the skipper of
the USS Vincennes acknowledged ``with a wave of his hand'' an
officer's warning that it might be a commercial airliner, Navy
investigators told Congress on Thursday.
   The warning was called out by one of the officers in the
confused combat information center of the sophisticated warship,
but ``other factors'' prompted Capt. Will C. Rogers to order two
missiles fired at the jet in the mistaken belief that it was an
F-14 fighter, according to Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty.
   Iran Air Flight 655, an A-300 Airbus, was destroyed and all 290
people aboard were killed.
   Fogarty told the Senate Armed Services Committee that an
unidentified officer standing behind Rogers called out ``possible
comm air (commercial aircraft),'' and Rogers acknowledged the
warning with ``a wave of his hand.''
   But Fogarty said Rogers was swayed by factors including its
takeoff from a military-civilian airfield, its failure to respond
to warnings from the Vincennes, and the mistaken beliefs that it
was outside a commercial air corridor and descending in altitude.
   In addition, Fogarty noted, the Vincennes had just been in
combat and was still fighting Iranian gunboats in the Strait of
Hormuz at the time of the attack, Fogarty said.
   A written, summary version of Fogarty's investigation was
released to the public three weeks ago. As with that report, his
testimony Thursday painted a portrait of confusion and human error
aboard one of the Navy's most advanced warships.
   The Vincennes is one of the Navy's $1 billion Aegis-class
cruisers, packed with what the service praises as the world's most
sophisticated electronic air defense system.
   The Aegis system worked well, Fogarty said, but the people
failed.
   For example, Iran Air 655 had been continually climbing from the
time it took off from Bandar Abbas and was at 13,000 feet when it
was struck by the two missiles, eight miles from the Vincennes.
   Officers in the combat center correctly identified the A-300
Airbus as climbing until the plane came to within 15 miles of the
Vincennes, when they inexplicably concluded that the plane was
descending toward the cruiser, Fogarty said.
   The misreading of the altitude was one of the most ``puzzling
aspects,'' Fogarty said, but the investigators were never able to
figure out how that occurred.
   ``The investigation was unsuccessful in satisfactorily
reconciling'' the discrepancy between electronic data which showed
the plane was still climbing and shouted verbal statements that it
was descending, he said.
   The Vincennes incorrectly thought the approaching plane was an
F-14, Fogarty said, but the after-action report was never able to
pin down exactly how that identification occurred.
   But Vincennes' officers were looking for F-14s, he noted, in
part because an F-14 had flown toward another U.S. warship, the USS
Halsey, on July 2 as the Halsey was in the strait.
   Despite the mistakes, Navy investigators concluded that Rogers
had acted to protect his ship and recommended no punitive actions.
   ``There was no culpable or willful negligence,'' said Fogarty.
Rogers ``was protecting his ship'' and was aware of the example of
the USS Stark.
   That was the Navy frigate hit by an Iraqi missile on May 17,
1987, killing 37 U.S. seamen. Stark officers were disciplined for
not protecting their ship.
   Legislators refused to criticize Rogers or the other officers.
   ``I believe this was a tragic mistake,'' said Sen. James Exon,
D-Neb., while Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former secretary of the
Navy, said Rogers acted correctly in trying to protect his ship.
   ``The easiest thing any of us can do is second-guess, and that's
not what we want to do,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The incident occurred the first time the Vincennes had been in
combat, but the ship's crew had been properly trained, Fogarty said.
   But the stress of combat cannot be simulated in any training, he
noted. ``Unless you get shot at, you're not trained in combat.''
   The Navy is considering adding some type of stress training for
officers, said Capt. George N. Gee, director of the surface combat
systems division and a former skipper of Aegis-class cruisers.
   The Vincennes was not protected U.S. AWACS airplanes flying
overhead, but the tracking planes wouldn't have made any
difference, Fogarty said, because they would have received the same
electronic information as the Vincennes.
   A nearby warship, the frigate Sides, had tracked the Airbus as a
possible Iranian military plane, but it concluded the plane was not
a threat, Fogarty noted.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached To Avoid Rush-Hour Strike in Chicago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago & North Western Railway and a union
representing 2,600 brakemen today agreed to delay any strike until
9 a.m. Friday, after the rush-hour commute of 41,000 suburban
Chicago riders.
   ``Both sides agree that this is a step that is in the best
interest of commuters,'' said David Carle, a spokesman for U.S. Sen
Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Simon is expected to try to push legislation through Congress to
settle the dispute before the evening rush hour Friday.
   Members of the United Transportation Union planned to walk out
at 12:01 a.m. Friday when a 36-day cooling-off period ended, but
compromised in exchange for a promise from the railroad to delay
layoffs that were to occur on Friday.
   The railroad and the union are bickering over the size of train
crews. C&NW wants to dump 1,150 brakemen whose jobs it says are
obsolete; the union believes the jobs are necessary to maintain
safety.
   C&NW spokesman James Foote said that in delaying the layoffs,
the railroad ``preserves the commuter rush here in Chicago and
avoids the disruption that would come from a strike at midnight.''
   Talks between the company and the union broke off late Wednesday
and were scheduled to resume today, said Mike Bushman, a spokesman
for U.S. Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill.
   Foote said Wednesday that the company and the union were ``still
quite a ways apart.''
   ``Because of the positions of the two parties, we're putting our
strike plans in effect,'' Foote said.
   The C&NW recalled about 8,000 replacement workers and mobilized
management personnel in anticipation of a strike against its
10-state Midwest freight system, Foote said.
   The UTU went on strike against C&NW for four hours Aug. 4 after
an earlier cooling-off period imposed by President Reagan. Congress
ended that walkout by imposing a second cooling-off period.
   While the dispute involves C&NW's freight operations, a strike
would shut down the railroad's commuter service, forcing an
estimated 41,000 people from Chicago's suburbs to find some way
else to get to work.
   Officials at Metra, a suburban commuter rail service that
purchases service from C&NW, said a strike would cripple service
and cause rush-hour chaos.

   Homicides deprive Americans of more than 600,000
years of life annually, the Centers for Disease Control reported
Thursday.
   The CDC reported that in 1985, its latest year for such
statistical analysis, the 18,351 homicides in the United States
resulted in 612,556 ``years of potential life lost'' by the victims.
   The Atlanta-based federal agency tabulates years of potential
life lost before age 65 as a means of studying the most common
causes of premature death. Sixty-five is a statistical benchmark;
actual life expectancy is higher.
   On average, a homicide victim in the United States is 32, the
CDC said.
   Since 1968, the toll of homicides, in terms of potential life,
has risen 44 percent, the CDC reported. During that same time, the
total of life-years lost to early deaths from all causes went down
25 percent.
   ``The dramatic increase in homicide-attributable (premature
death) since 1968 highlights the need for public health efforts
directed toward the prevention of interpersonal violence,'' said
the weekly report of the CDC.
   The CDC report, from its Injury Epidemiology and Control
division, called for increased cooperation among the criminal
justice, social services, health care, mental health and public
health sectors, to prompt ``development of effective programs for
prevention of homicides.''
   The major method of homicide continues to be firearms, the CDC
reported. Firearms and explosives accounted for 61 percent of the
potential life-years lost to homicide in 1985, or 376,291 years.
   Black males continue to have the highest homicide rate, the CDC
said. In 1985, 6,284 black men died from homicide _ a rate of 49
out of every 100,000. White men died in 7,467 homicides, for a rate
of 8 per 100,000.
   But the CDC cited studies published earlier this year showing
that the homicide rate for young black men is dropping.
   The homicide rate for black males 15-24 _ the highest-risk group
for homicide _ has fallen 13 percent since 1978, from 1,934
homicides and a rate of 70 per 100,000 in 1978 to 1,710 homicides
and a rate of 62 per 100,000 in 1984.
   Federal health officials have a goal of reducing the homicide
rate among black males 15-24 to less than 60 per 100,000 by the
next decade. The statistics ``suggest ... the 1990 objective for
this target group can be attained,'' the CDC said.
   Black female homicides numbered 1,550, or 11 per 100,000; 2,630
white females died in homicides, at a rate of 3 per 100,000.

   ``Everyone thinks it's so weird to walk, but you can get used to

   Ms. Imming had her pick of six vehicles and chose a Pontiac
Grand Am. She said she liked its roomy interior.

   Rick and Linda Vincent plan on

   The Newaygo couple were racing to Blodgett Memorial Medical

miles away when it became obvious the baby wouldn't wait.
   ``I knew his head was already coming out when I told Rick to
pull over,'' Mrs. Vincent said Thursday from her hospital bed.
   The McDonald's along Route 37 in Sparta wasn't open yet, but its
lights were on, so the couple pulled their van into the parking lot.
   A manager inside called for an ambulance, but David Michael
Vincent arrived before it did.
   The baby, at 7 pounds, 6 ounces, is healthy, though the cold
weather dropped his body temperature. He was placed under heat
lamps at the hospital.
   The couple say the baby's first birthday won't be the last one
celebrated at McDonald's. Restaurant officials said they will have
a free birthday party for David Michael Vincent every year.

   President Reagan plans a series of meetings
with allied officials during his visit late this month to the
United Nations, but the president has not attempted to turn the
occasion into a Western summit, his spokesman said Thursday.
   Chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed earlier reports that
Reagan had invited the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel to
meet with him to discuss the stalled Mideast peace-making process.
He also said that Reagan had invited other world figures to meet
individually with him during Reagan's two-day stay Sept. 26-27.
   But Fitzwater vigorously denied a report that Reagan had sought
to use the opening of the U.N. General Assembly session to hold a
summit with the heads of government or heads of state of Western
allies.
   News accounts suggesting such a move, he said, ``are incorrect.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman dismissed such
speculation as ``wildly inaccurate.''
   Fielding several questions on this subject at the daily White
House news briefing, Fitzwater confirmed that Reagan will ``hold a
number of meetings with heads of delegations, some on a bilateral
basis and some in larger groups.''
   ``In addition the president will meet with foreign ministers or
heads of state from several other countries during the visit,'' he
said. ``We're not prepared to announce any specific meetings at

   Fitzwater said that ``undoubtedly the president will meet either

construed as summits.''
   ``What's happened is, the president's having a number of

heads of delegations for those meetings,'' he said. ``In some

and in many cases, it will be the foreign minister.''
   ``I think what's happening is we have sent the invitations,

   In Paris Thursday, the office of President Francois Mitterrand
said Reagan had asked Mitterrand to meet with him Sept. 27 in New
York, and that the invitation was still ``under study.''
   Mitterrand already had been scheduled to meet Reagan at the
White House on Sept. 29. These and other responses to the
invitations sent by the White House evidently spurred the reports
of attempts to arrange a summit.
   Fitzwater said he knew of no plan by Reagan to try to see each
of the heads of state or government of the Western allies before he
leaves office next January.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who singled Reagan out
for praise in a warm farewell speech at the conclusion of the
seven-nation economic summit last June in Toronto, is scheduled to
visit here in November.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted a 1971
busing order in the city's schools, ruling that segregationist
practices have been eliminated.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II, in a decision issued
Tuesday, lifted the 17-year-old desegregation order that ushered in
crosstown busing.
   The school system is now free to redraw boundary lines, reduce
crosstown busing and set its own standards for an integrated school
system, said Jannell Byrd, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense
and Education Fund Inc.
   School Board Chairman Billy Parker said today there would be no
immediate changes, but predicted at least 25 percent of the 9,000
students being bused for desegregation reasons could return to
their neighborhood schools next fall.
   Some busing will continue in places where it would otherwise be
impossible to maintain an integrated school system, he said.
   School Superintendent Herb Sang predicted today that the
students being bused with be able to attend classes in their
neighborhoods in two years.
   Willye Dennis, the leader of the Jacksonville branch of the
NAACP, said the organization maintains the school system is not
desegregated.
   ``We need to get the message out to the community that if this
case is not appealed, we are going to be in a bind,'' she said.
   Moore found that segregationist practices do not exist, despite
some imbalances in the school system's racial makeup. The
104,000-student school system's ratio of white students to black
students is 65 percent to 35 percent.
   The judge said the school system had done a reasonable job of
attempting to maintain racial balance, although he said practical
problems got in the way.
   Moore wrote that Duval County's size, about two-thirds the size
of Rhode Island, made it difficult to rectify shifts in population
patterns through busing.
   He judge ruled that the facilities and curriculum were equal at
all county schools. Jacksonville and Duval County have the same
borders.

adjusting to his new home and will begin receiving vistors again on
Saturday, officials at the Cincinnati Zoo said Thursday.
   Public viewings of the 290-pound panda on loan from the London
Zoo were halted Sept. 3 because the panda apparently was homesick
and jet-lagged, officials said.
   Cincinnati Zoo spokeswoman Barbara Brady apologized to the as
many as 4,000 spectators who were turned away from the panda
exhibit. The zoo issued rain checks, Ms. Brady said.
   The 16-year-old panda has lived at the London Zoo since his
capture at age 2 in his native China. He is to stay in Cincinnati
until the end of November before moving to his new home at Mexico
City's Chapultepec Zoo, where it is hoped Chia Chia will take part
in a successful breeding program. His former mate at the London Zoo
died in 1985.
   Cincinnati zookeepers have helped Chia Chia adjust by enhancing
the accommodations, including building a new platform for him. The
animal has spent much of the time inside his den.
   Zoo executive director Edward Maruska said revenues from Chia
Chia's three-month display will be used for new housing at the
Mexico City zoo for the panda, and to set up a conservation fund
for the animals.

   Jury selection in one of the biggest civil
cases in U.S. history began today with the judge warning
prospective jurors that the Washington Public Power Supply System
fraud trial could last several months.
   However, U.S. District Judge William Browning also said he would
do what he could to accommodate those selected as jurors, including
providing parking and lodgings in town for people from beyond the
metropolitan area.
   Jury selection was expected to be completed Friday.
   Twenty jurors will be seated to hear the lawsuit, which arose
over WPPSS' default on $2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance
construction of two nuclear plants.
   The plants were scrapped after they were partially built, and
the subsequent 1983 default was the biggest in the history of the
municipal bond market, leaving 40,000 people holding worthless
bonds.
   More than 24,000 people who bought the bonds sued, alleging
fraud in the planning and construction.
   The trial had been expected to take eight months to two years,
but settlements with many of the 100-plus defendants are expected
to cut the duration to a year at most.
   The case was moved to Arizona because jurors in the Northwest
might have to pay for any jury award through their electricity
rates and might therefore be ifluenced in their verdict.
   Named as defendants were WPPSS, its member utilities, the 88
utilities that contracted with WPPSS to build the plants, bond
underwriters and engineering and financial consulting firms.
   Settlements totaling $351 million have reduced the number of
defendants to 20 Washington utilities, an Oregon utility, two
engineering firms and a company that gave financial advice to WPPSS.

   Guerrillas shot down an Afghan
military transport aircraft, killing 16 people, two of them
generals, Radio Kabul said today.
   The guerrillas shot down the Soviet-built AN-32 military
transport aircraft on Wednesday with a stinger missile, said the
radio, monitored in Islamabad.
   The plane's 12 passengers and four crew all died when the plane
was hit by the missile, the radio said.
   The passengers included Brig. Gen. Mohammad Ismail Noori; Brig.
Gen. Abdul Ahad Razmenda, vice attorney of the defense ministry;
and Col. Mohammad Hassan Koshyar, in charge of political affairs of
the regional forces in Kunduz.
   The aircraft was on a flight from Kabul to Kunduz city, 162
miles northeast of Kabul, when it was shot down. Kunduz is close to
the Soviet border.
   The Soviet-built AN-32 is a two-engined turboprop, which has a
cruising speed of 317 mph. It can carry up to 39 passengers, 30
paratroopers or 24 stretchers.
   Major fighting between the guerrillas and Soviet and Afghan
security forces has been reported in recent days. Kunduz was
heavily bombed by Soviet aircraft flying from the Soviet territory
in late August soon after the guerrillas gained control of the city.
   The Soviets have been withdrawing their 115,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan under an agreement signed in Geneva in April. U.N.
officials say more than half the troops have left. The Soviets have
said they will pull out the rest by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan Record Investment in Plant and Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite rising interest rates, U.S. businesses
plan to boost plant and equipment spending to record levels this
year as capital investment remains one of the strongest sectors of
the economy, the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said a survey found that businesses plan
to spend $429.4 billion, after adjusting for inflation, topping the
previous high of $391.6 billion set in 1985.
   This 11.6 percent increase over the 1987 spending total, if
realized, would mark the biggest percentage jump since a 16.6
percent rise in 1984, when American industry was still recovering
from the steep 1981-82 recession.
   ``Capital spending is the main driving force in the economy at
the present time and there are no signs that it is going to ease
off,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   So far this year, business spending on plant and equipment and a
boom in export sales have accounted for almost three-fourths of
total economic growth.
   The two developments are closely related, as American
manufacturers have rushed to expand production facilities in an
effort to meet growing overseas demand for their goods.
   Sinai estimated that one-third of U.S. industry is operating at
full capacity, providing a strong incentive to boost investment.
Overall, American industry is operating at 83.5 percent of
capacity, the highest rate in eight years.
   The high operating rates have led to concerns that the economy
is beginning to push against capacity constraints and tight labor
markets, resulting in rising inflationary pressures.
   The Federal Reserve has been pushing up interest rates since
late March as a way of fighting inflation by dampening demand.
Economists said the rate increases so far will not likely trigger
any cutbacks in investment plans this year, although they expect a
slowdown in 1989.
   ``It takes time to make capital investment decisions so higher
interest rates won't slow this spending over the next several
months,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National
Association of Manufacturers.
   ``Companies are making major increases in capital spending to
expand capacity and reduce costs through greater use of
information-processing equipment,'' he said, noting that half of
the equipment spending in 1987 went to purchase computers and
related equipment.
   The new estimate of business investment plans released Thursday
was based on company surveys completed over the past two months.
   It represented only a small change from a June report that
estimated spending would rise 11.9 percent this year. Both surveys
represented substantial gains from estimates made at the beginning
of the year that investment would only climb by 7.3 percent this
year.
   In 1987, investment spending edged up a modest 2.3 percent after
having fallen 3.9 percent in 1986. Analysts said some of the
rebound this year reflected pent-up demand after two sluggish
spending years.
   ``This is a very typical pattern where there is a rush to spend
on plant and equipment after a period of hesistation as companies
waited to be sure of the business environment,'' Sinai said.
   The weakness in 1986 and 1987 was blamed on the soaring U.S.
trade deficit, which sent the manufacturing sector into a slump as
a flood of imports reduced domestic demand for U.S. goods at the
same time American companies were being priced out of overseas
markets.
   This year, manufacturers expect to boost spending by 12.5
percent, with all durable-goods industries except automobiles
planning to boost investment over the 1987 level.
   The largest increase in production of non-durable goods, those
expected to last less than three years, is forecast in the paper
industry. Plants there are operating at 92.8 percent of capacity,
the highest level of any industry.
   In non-manufacturing industries, the report predicted an
increase of 12.4 percent in capital investment by transportation
companies, including airlines. It saw only a 1.3 percent rise in
investment spending by public utilities, which have faced problems
of slumping electric power demand and delays in licensing nuclear
plants throughout most of the decade.
   The mining industry, which includes oil and gas exploration,
projected a 5.5 percent increase in spending in 1988, representing
only a modest rebound after big declines in the past two years
because of falling world energy prices.
   Before removing the effects of inflation, business investment is
projected to rise by 10.6 percent this year to $430.9 billion,
following an increase of 2.7 percent in 1987.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Son-in-Law Pleads Guilty to Abusing Office, but Not
Bribery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-law pleaded guilty
Thursday to abusing his office when he was deputy interior minister
but told a military court he did not take bribes, a crime
punishable by death.
   On the fourth day of a trial so far devoted almost entirely to
reading of 1,500 pages of corruption charges against Yuri Churbanov
and eight co-defendants, Judge Mikhail Marov asked Churbanov if he
understood the charges.
   ``Yes, they were understood,'' Churbanov replied, standing
before the court. ``I admit my guilt in abuse of office but don't
admit my guilt in receiving bribes.''
   Churbanov was accused of accepting cash, wines, cognac, exotic
fruits and other gifts worth more than $1 million while he was
first deputy interior minister under Brezhnev, the Soviet leader
from 1964 until his death in 1982.
   Prosecutors contend the web of corruption stretched all the way
to Churbanov's boss, the late Nikolai A. Shchelokov, who was a
close friend of Brezhnev.
   Court records confirmed earlier reports that Shchelokov
committed suicide after investigators began examining his conduct
as interior minister.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Brezhnev's years in power
are now condemned officially as ``years of stagnation'' in which
the economy slumped, mistakes were made in foreign policy, and
corruption and cronynism prevailed.
   Almost daily criticism of him appears in the Soviet press.
Streets and towns have been stripped of his name, a palace built
for him has been turned over to the public, and libraries have been
told not to carry literature produced during his rule.
   Judge Marov, an army major general, said Churbanov would be
required to clarify his plea in the course of the trial.
   Churbanov's lawyer, Andrei M. Makarov, told a reporter
punishment for abuse of office is 10 years in jail. If convicted of
taking bribes, the 51-year-old former official could face a firing
squad.
   Makarov told a reporter he would not clarify the plea now but
the explanation would come out during the trial. It is expected to
last about two months, but Thursday was the last day foreign
reporters were permitted to attend.
   Khaidar Yakhyaev, former interior minister of the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan, pleaded guilty Thursday to all charges
against him. On Wednesday, he claimed officials pressured him in
prison to confess.
   The other defendants, all former officials of Uzbekistan,
pleaded guilty to taking bribes but not always to the extent
prosecutors alleged.
   In summarizing the charges, the prosecution said: ``The
demoralization reached unheard-of levels, especially in the party
organs of the republic of Uzbekistan.''
   Mrs. Churbanov, the former Galina Brezhnev, has not attended
trial sessions. Her husband's lawyer said she was ill and would
testify for her husband later.
   The lesser defendants, according to the indictment, accepted
money and gifts from underlings in exchange for jobs, promotions
and special perquisites of many descriptions, the indictment says.

   Discovery's astronauts donned orange
pressure suits and threw switches in a successful practice
countdown Thursday, and NASA officials said they hope to launch the
first space shuttle since the Challenger tragedy this month.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to
announce a launch date Wednesday, following a two-day flight
readiness review here. Officials have been discussing a date from
Sept. 26 to 29.
   ``We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count
for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the
month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director Forrest S. McCartney told
the launch team after the test.
   ``It certainly sets the stage for what we're about ready to do
here in just a few weeks,'' launch director Bob Sieck added.
   ``You have a feeling this train is about to leave the station
and we're about to get on board,'' said astronaut Mike Lounge.
   ``The enthusiasm around here is obvious,'' McCartney said. ``It
seems to me like we've finally got it put back together.''
   He referred to the long recovery, with its many setbacks and
milestones, from the Challenger explosion that killed seven
astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Thursday's practice countdown was the last of those major
milestones, and it was completed with only a few minor
communications glitches.
   It began Wednesday, and the five-man Discovery crew boarded the
shuttle Thursday to participate in the final two hours, throwing
switches, testing communications and monitoring systems, just as
they will on launch day.
   The commander is Navy Capt. Rick Hauck. The pilot is Air Force
Lt. Col. Dick Covey, and the mission specialists are George Nelson,
Lounge and Marine Maj. David Hilmers. All have flown on shuttle
missions.
   For the test, they wore bright orange pressure suits, the first
time a crew has not worn comfortable flight coveralls since the
fifth shuttle mission in 1982.
   The pressure garments, which all shuttle crews will wear on
launch and re-entry, would be needed in case of trouble during an
emergency landing attempt and the astronauts had to bail out by
blowing an explosive hatch, sliding down a telescoping pole to
avoid hitting the wing, and parachuting to Earth.
   This emergency escape system has been added since the Challenger
explosion. It would not help in a Challenger-type accident, in
which the shuttle blew up 73 seconds after liftoff.
   The communications problems, in ground equipment, delayed some
practice countdown activities and the test ended 34 minutes late. A
computer stopped the count at six seconds before a mock liftoff,
just as it would if there were an engine problem on an actual
launch, giving the launch team experience in handling such a
situation.
   The test concluded three days of training here for Discovery's
crew. Afterward they returned to their base at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
   Hauck and Lounge will be back here next week to represent the
crew at the flight readiness review which will determine a launch
date.
   Hauck said the meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday, ``is an
in-depth review that all elements of the program will have a
requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that their part of
the program is ready for us to fly.''

<HEAD>Energy Department Asks For Nuclear Waste Dump Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department urged Congress on
Thursday to give speedy approval to legislation allowing the
government to open in New Mexico the nation's first permanent dump
for radioactive garbage resulting from nuclear weapons production.
   But Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said he will insist that the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP, meet standards still being
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency before any nuclear
trash is stored at the 10,000-acre site east of Carlsbad.
   Troy E. Wade II, acting assistant energy secretary for defense
programs, countered that limited storage of nuclear wastes is
necessary for an experimental five-year period to help scientists
determine compliance with EPA regulations.
   Richard J. Guimond, director of the EPA's office of radiation
programs, agreed, saying experimental storage would ``better
information to make that determination.''
   Richardson said there is no way the WIPP facility can begin
receiving the first of 210,000 tons of radioactive trash by next
month's target date, because the steel containers for transporting
the wastes have proved unsatisfactory in performance tests.
   Wade said tests of a redesigned container are nearing
completion, and certification is expected before the end of the
year.
   Richardson presided over a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee hearing on a compromise bill that would withdraw
federal lands from other uses at the Carlsbad site, with permanent
jurisdiction going to the Energy Department for operation of the
WIPP facility.
   WIPP is designed to provide permanent disposal of 6.3 million
cubic feet of radioactive garbage from nuclear weapons factories _
such as plutonium-contaminated gloves, bottles, pipes and valves _
in rock salt beds 2,150 feet below ground.
   The trash would be transported to New Mexico by truck from
nuclear weapons plants around the country, the bulk of it from the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and the Rocky Flats Plant
outside Denver.

<HEAD>Report: Brezhnev Revived From Clinical Death, Left Senile Last
Years Of Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonid Brezhnev was revived from clinical death in
1976, but was left so senile and weakened he had difficulty
performing simple tasks the last six years of his rule, a Soviet
historian says.
   The historian, Roy Medvedev, wrote in an article entitled
``Advantages of Mediocrity'' that the late president and Communist
Party general secretary was weak-willed, untalented and the object
of ridicule among many Soviets.
   Medvedev said Brezhnev ``ceased to understand what was going on
around him'' and his public appearances, during which he had to be
held by each arm, drew public ire.
   ``The Soviet leader's senility, infirmity and sickness became a
subject not so much of compassion and pity on the part of Soviet
citizens, but rather of irritation and mockery, expressed ever more
openly,'' Medvedev wrote.
   The article, in the latest edition of the weekly Moscow News,
was published while Brezhnev's son-in-law Yuri Churbanov and eight
co-defendants were being tried in Moscow on corruption and bribery
charges.
   Churbanov, the husband of Brezhnev's daughter Galina, was deputy
interior minister under his father-in-law. He pleaded guilty
Thursday to abuse of office, but denied taking bribes. Prosecutors
alleged he accepted $1 million in bribes.
   The trial and appearance of Medvedev's article are part of the
increasingly harsh assessment of Brezhnev's rule taking place under
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Brezhnev's rule from 1964 until
his death in 1982 are now condemned officially as ``years of
stagnation'' in which the economy slumped, mistakes were made in
foreign policy, and corruption and cronynism prevailed.
   A campaign has been launched to rid the country of Brezhnev's
legacy. Almost daily criticism of him appears in the Soviet press.
Streets and towns have been stripped of his name, a palace built
for him has been turned over to the public, and libraries cannot
carry literature produced during his rule.
   Medvedev said Brezhnev's health worsened in 1969 or 1970 until
``at one point in early 1976, he was clinically dead and after
being revived, had to wait for three months for his thinking and
speech to normalize.'' He did not say what Brezhnev nearly died of.
   The leader's working day was cut to a few hours, and ``it became
increasingly difficult for him to perform even the simplest
protocol duties,'' Medvedev wrote.
   Medvedev described Brezhnev, who died at age 75, as a vain man
whose jacket was heavy with military decorations, even though ``he
took no part in the decisive battles of the Patriotic War (World
War II).''
   Throughout most of his life, Brezhnev advanced by being
unoffensive to political cronies, Medvedev suggested.
   ``He wasn't a climber who elbowed his way to the top or betrayed
his friends. He was calm, loyal to colleagues and higher-ups. He
didn't so much move ahead himself as he was moved ahead by
others,'' Medvedev said.
   A notoriously poor speaker, Brezhnev made speeches almost weekly
in which ``he often mispronounced words, long words being the
hardest for him. His speechwriters were strictly instructed not to
include long words in prepared texts,'' Medvedev wrote.
   Brezhnev got his start in the Ukrainian city of
Dneprodzerzhinsk. He became party chief in Moldavia and later was
sent by Nikita Khrushchev to Kazakhstan to direct land reclamation.
   He returned to Moscow two years later and ``managed to transfer
some of the people he had worked with in Moldavia and the Ukraine
to Moscow,'' the historian wrote.
   Medvedev said Brezhnev moved into the power seat because his
do-nothing approach was exactly what officials wanted after
Khrushchev, who was constantly pushing reform.
   ``After Khrushchev's removal, the top party-state apparatus
didn't want an overly strong leader. They wanted a quieter life and
quieter work. Brezhnev's victory was thus based on weakness and the
absence of obvious ambition and craving for power,'' the article
said.
   Medvedev said Brezhnev's legacy is of ``mismanagement,
irresponsibility ... The corruption eroding society became more
abashed and insolent, the abuses of power (and) the embezzling on
large and small scales became the norm.''
   Medvedev was expelled from the Communist Party under Brezhnev
and his brother, Zhores, was declared insane. Soviet publications
began printing some of Roy Medvedev's controversial works only this
year under Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness.
   He is the author of ``Let History Judge,'' a celebrated
indictment of the Stalinist period that has yet to be published in
the Soviet Union. Along with Zhores, he also has written a piercing
criticism of Khrushchev.

   Delaware's maverick lieutenant governor, the
nation's highest-ranking elected official of Chinese descent, faces
a civic activist in a Democratic primary Saturday for the right to
challenge Republican Sen. William V. Roth Jr.
   Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the
University of Delaware, was a political unknown four years ago when
he bucked the Democratic Party leadership, defeated two legislators
in a primary and won election to his mainly ceremonial post by 479
votes.
   Instead of seeking re-election, Woo now is hoping to go after
Roth, who is running for a fourth term.
   But first he must defeat Samuel S. Beard, a 49-year-old former
staffer to the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy who later launched a
non-profit company which helps obtain grants and designs plans to
attract economic development.
   A poll conducted late last month for the Wilmington News Journal
showed Woo supported by 45 percent of likely voters, Beard by 31
percent and 24 percent undecided.
   But Beard has heavy support from unions and unofficial backing
from Democratic leaders, and some observers think the outcome could
depend on voter turnout.
   ``If it's a light vote, Sam Beard can win because most of the
party people are going to vote for him,'' said state party Chairman
Samu 70 percent of
his million-dollar-plus campaign warchest from Chinese-Americans
across the nation.
   ``People are very proud that a Chinese-American is running for a
high office,'' said Charles Siegel, Woo's spokesman.
   Going into the primary, Woo had $407,998 on hand, compared to
Beard's $65,008. Roth, who has no primary opponent, had $734,933.
   Woo's ethnic background became an issue in the campaign when
Edward ``Pete'' Peterson, president of the state AFL-CIO, wrote an
open letter backing Beard in which he said, ``It is up to you and I
to save this country not only from the Asian influences the Lt.
Gov. refers to, but all foreign influence.''
   Earlier this week, Peterson wrote another letter apologizing to
anyone offended by that statement. He said he was referring to
Woo's claims that he has many contacts with business leaders in
Asia.

   The millionaire husband of a woman
kidnapped six weeks ago offered a $100,000 reward Thursday for
information leading to her safe return.
   The offer came in a three-paragraph statement by Robert M.
Hearin released by the FBI.
   Annie Laurie Hearin, 72, was taken July 26 from her Jackson
home. Hearin has paid nearly $1 million to 12 people whose names
were on a crude ransom note found the day of the kidnapping.
   ``My family and I have heard nothing from her since receiving a
letter in her handwriting dated Aug. 10, 1988,'' the statement
said. ``We continue to pray for her safety and safe return.
   ``I am offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to
her safe return to her family, or information leading to the
identification and conviction of those responsible for her
kidnapping.''
   The statement added that anyone with information should contact
the nearest office of the FBI.
   Wayne Taylor, special agent in charge of the FBI in Mississippi,
said there was no immediate response to the reward but ``it's still
early.''
   Taylor said he could not comment on specific leads but added,
``We are working all day every day.''
   The ailing Mrs. Hearin suffers from ileitis, an intestinal
condition that doctors say could result in her death without
medication.
   The typewritten ransom note ordered Hearin to pay an unspecified
amount of money to people he allegedly wronged.
   On Aug. 23, the FBI announced that Hearin had followed
instructions in the note, and that payment was mailed to the 12
named in the letters _ or their survivors _ on Aug. 16, a day after
Hearin received a hand-written letter from his wife of 48 years.
   The 12 are current or former franchisers with School Pictures of
Mississippi Inc. The company, whose largest stockholder at one time
was Hearin, filed suit against the 12 in the early 1980s claiming
they owed money from operating loans, materials and film processing
fees. Hearin researched the monetary amounts involved in the
lawsuits for each of the 12 in figuring how much to pay.
   Neither the FBI nor Hearin has given out the exact amounts he
paid.
   Mrs. Hearin's letter was the first indication she was alive. The
letter, which the FBI said was in Mrs. Hearin's handwriting, had an
Atlanta postmark.
   His wife's letter promised that she would be returned if the
payments were made. At least one who received the payments refused
to accept the money, while the others declined comment.
   Hearin is co-owner of Mississippi Valley Gas Co. and he and his
partner, New Jersey oil man Leon Hess, own controlling interest in
Lamar Life Corp. The businessman's net worth exceeds $100 million.

   E. Robert Wallach, awaiting trial on
racketeering charges in the Wedtech bribery case, came to the
National Press Club Thursday and asked reporters to help him repair
his reputation.
   The San Francisco lawyer said he may have made ``honest
mistakes'' in his dealings in Washington after the Reagan
administration and his longtime friend Edwin Meese III came to
power.
   But Wallach, 54, said he bore no resemblance to the venal
influence-peddler depicted in news accounts. That Bob Wallach, he
said, ``never existed, does not exist, did not exist.''
   Wallach portrayed himself as the victim of a vendetta by the
media and investigators to drive Meese from office. Meese, the
former White House counselor, resigned last month after 3{
embattled years as attorney general.
   Wallach goes on trial in New York Jan. 3 on federal racketeering
and conspiracy charges. He allegedly tried to influence Meese and
other public officials on behalf of Wedtech Corp., the Bronx, N.Y.,
defense contractor that collapsed in a bribery scandal.
   Independent counsel James McKay reported in July that Meese
helped Wallach in his efforts in 1981 and 1982 to secure a $32
million engine-building contract for Wedtech from the Army, and
also aided his friend in 1985 in connection with a $1 billion Iraqi
oil pipeline project. Wallach was paid $150,000 by a partner in the
pipeline project.
   The $150,000 was pooled with Meese's money and that of other
investors by financial manager W. Franklyn Chinn, who turned a
$40,000 profit for Meese on a $50,000 investment in 18 months.
   McKay said Wallach steered Meese to Chin, arranged two loans for
Meese and helped line up a $40,000 job for Meese's wife, Ursula.
   But McKay decided not to seek any indictment of Meese and said
there was ``no direct evidence that Mr. Meese accepted anything of
value from Mr. Wallach with the requisite state of mind for a
gratuities violation.''
   Wallach, who was paid from $1.3 million to $1.4 million by
Wedtech, said Wedtech's officers ``have conned everybody'' and
falsely accused him of soliciting money to quash the investigation.
   ``I'm telling you, I am an innocent man. I'm telling you the
system caught an innocent man and the media played a role in it,''
Wallach said.
   ``I am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort to
drive Ed Meese from office. ... I proved to be a most attractive
vehicle to help accomplish that goal,'' he said.
   Wallach said a ``great senior figure'' of the Washington
community had commiserated with him, telling him, ``I should have
explained to you where the paths were in the jungle.''
   ``Is that what it's about? If a person comes here and makes an
honest mistake _ and I think I made some mistakes _ does that mean
you fall into the pit with stakes and it's all over with, you're
finished and that's the end? Is there no forgiveness for honest
mistakes? Must it always be read in the light of malevolence and
evil-doing and wrong-doing? Is the only access to success in your
career to destroy someone?'' he asked the reporters.
   He depicted himself as a self-made man, a grandson of Jewish
immigrants who won a scholarship and worked his way through college
to become a pillar of the San Francisco bar and backer of liberal
causes.
   ``I want you to know that I am not one of the great money-makers
of the California legal profession. I frankly never really was
that. I always made a very good living, but only practiced about
half-time because I was doing a lot of other things, including a
lot of pro bono activities and teaching,'' he said. ``My practice
died because of the media coverage.''
   But he said his friendship with Meese ``has never been breached.
The friendship is intact.''
   Wallach lodged the same complaints Wednesday night at an
American University forum on the press, where he was joined by
former White House political director Lyn Nofziger, who is
appealing a conviction on illegal lobbying charges.

   President Reagan ordered a Cabinet-level team
Thursday to visit the forest fire zones in the West to see what
more the federal government can do to help, but the White House
said nobody knows when or whether the fires can be put out.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said that no
federal officials are expected to resign or be discharged because
the blazes were allowed to spread.
   There has been criticism of the National Park Service for
following, during the early stages of this summer's disastrous
fires, its usual practice of allowing them to burn to encourage
reforestation.
   Some critics, including lawmakers, have called for the
resignation of William Penn Mott, the director of the Park Service.
   Fitzwater said Reagan directed Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel and Deputy Defense Secretary
William H. Taft IV to go to the Western states this weekend to
confer with governors, ``assess the situation'' and report to the
president next week.
   He said one likely outcome is that more Army troops will be sent
to supplement the 2,500 now on the firelines.
   The spokesman said Hodel brought up the subject of the calls for
Penn's resignation, but there was no discussion of it.
   ``There are no plans to fire anybody,'' Fitzwater said. ``That
call represents an understandable frustration by people who have
been living with a great natural disaster, but that hasn't really
been a significant issue. We don't expect any departures.''
   As to the outlook for the future, Fitzwater said, ``The feeling
from the two secretaries is that we can be effective up to a point,
but no one is willing to speculate on whether or not the fire can
be totally extinguished or in how long a period of time.''
   The Agriculture Department is the parent of the Forest Service
and the Interior Department includes the Park Service. Together,
the two agencies control much of the 1.5 million acres of
timberland on which fires are raging.
   Of the Park Service's policy of allowing the fires to burn,
which has since been abandoned with regard to the current
conflagrations, Fitzwater said: ``Everyone accepts that that was
the right course, in the sense that good forest practice for the
past several years has been to allow a certain amount of burning
for purposes of resforestation.''
   ``I think there is a general expectation that we can hold the
line, but we have got to stay with it and probably will need some
resources,'' he said.
   He said the fire season in the Pacific Coast states is now
beginning, ``so while we may be able to see some control occur in
the Montana-Wyoming-Yellowstone area, it may be starting up in the
West and that is going to demand more resources.''
   ``We could well be moving a lot more military resources into
this,'' the spokesman said. ``I would expect that out of this trip
will come some recommendations along this line.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan called the meeting after Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., told the president during a meeting with
Republican congressional leaders on Wednesday that he ``wanted to
express the anguish of his constituents and others in the region''
who have lost homes and jobs because of the fires.
   The spokesman said Reagan received a status report at Thursday's
meeting saying that 2,600 firefighters from 39 states were fighting
34 major blazes covering 1.5 million acres.

   President Reagan today dispatched a
Cabinet-level team to the West to see what additional federal help
is needed in fighting forest fires, and the White House said the
number of troops on the fire line is likely to be increased.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan met with Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel and Deputy
Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV.
   The three official are expected to leave for the West tomorrow.
Fitzwater said they would visit Yellowstone National Park and other
areas suffering from fires that have now covered 1.5 million acres
in six states.
   Fitzwater said 2,500 military personnel are now fighting the
fires and this number may very well be increased.
   ``I would expect that out of this trip will come some
recommendation along this line,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said Reagan called today's meeting after Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., expressed concern about the fire situation at a
meeting of Republican congressional leaders with the president on
Wednesday.
   Although some critics of the Park Service's policy of allowing
many fires that begin naturally to burn have called for the
resignation of the director of the Park Service, Fitzwater said,
``We have no plans to fire anybody.''
   He said Hodel, whose department encompasses the Park Service,
brought the subject of these calls for resignation up briefly
during the meeting but there was no discussion of it.
   ``Our feeling is that the Agriculture Department and the
Interior Department have responded very effectively'' and were
right to let the fires burn, Fitzwater said.
   The policy was abandoned July 22, he said, because of the
unparalleled intensity of the blazes.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., met Wednesday with Hodel and
suggested that William Penn Mott, the Park Service director, ought
to resign.
   Hodel and Mott have clashed in the past, but today Hodel
rejected Wallop's suggestion, saying in a statement:
   ``I don't know anyone with greater love and concern for the
national parks than Bill Mott. He and the National Park Service
professionals advising him assure me they are doing everything in
their power. ... What they need at this time is our understanding
of the difficulties they face and our support.''
   In a news conference Wednesday, Mott and forest service
officials admitted that in hindsight they should have fought every
fire from the beginning.
   Of the 13 fires now burning in Yellowstone, five started before
July 22 and initially were allowed to burn. The other eight were
fought from the beginning, the officials said.

<HEAD>Pathologist Says He Believes British Shot IRA On The Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>

   British commandoes who shot to death three
Irish Republican Army guerrillas fired into the head of one Irish
nationalist as he lay bleeding on the ground, a pathologist
testified Thursday.
   Glasgow University Professor Alan Watson said at least four of
the bullets fired into the head of Sean Savage, 24, were fired
downward by a soldier as he stood over the IRA member's body.
   A second pathologist, called as a witness by the attorney for
the family, supported Watson's view.
   Watson, who conducted autopsies on the men, testified on the
third day of an inquest by Coroner Feliz Pizzarello and an 11-man
jury into the March 6 shooting deaths in this British colony of IRA
members Savage, 24, Mairead Farrell, 31, and Daniel McCann, 30.
   The IRA has acknowledged the trio were on ``active service''
when they were killed by British soldiers. The IRA regularly
employs the phrase to refer to members on missions to attack
British military targets.
   The inquest is being held to determine whether the shooting
deaths were lawful, but it has no power of prosecution. Still,
Gibraltar's attorney general is expected to return criminal
indictments if the jury finds that the killings were unlawful.
   A senior British intelligence official who testified Wednesday
said the British soldiers shot the three unarmed IRA members
because they wrongly believed they were armed and on the verge of
detonating a car bomb in the British fortress colony.
   The official, only identified as `O' for security reasons,
testified to the court behind a curtain.
   At the start of his testimony, Watson spent 10 minutes detailing
the wounds to the three IRA members.
   He said Savage was shot 18 times, five times in the back, five
times in the head and eight times in various parts of the body.
   Farrell received five shots to the head and neck and three shots
in the back, Watson said, while McCann received two bullets in the
head and two more in the back.
   Watson's statements were based on the post-mortem examination he
conducted the day after the shootings.
   Michael Hucker, the attorney for the seven soldiers involved in
the shootings and believed to be members of the elite British
anti-terrorist regiment Special Air Services (SAS), sought to show
that the soldiers believed the three men may have still been
dangerous despite having fallen to the ground.
   Watson said it would have been possible for the injured men to
push a button, a reference to the car bomb British intelligence had
thought the group was preparing to set off in the center of the
colony at Spain's southernmost tip.
   A second pathologist, Derek Pounder, professor of forensic
medicine at Dundee University in Dundee, Scotland, told the inquest
he also had concluded that Savage was shot in the head while lying
face-up on the ground.
   ``It is clear from the scrapes around the margins of the wound
(on the left side of Savage's neck) that the bullet was coming from
the feet of Mr. Savage,'' Pounder said.
   The intelligence official `O' told the inquest Wednesday that
British commandoes had been informed prior to the shooting that the
IRA members ``were dangerous terrorists who almost certainly would
be armed and, if confronted by Security Service personnel, would be
likely to use their weapons.''
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
say the killings were part of an unofficial ``shoot-to-kill''
policy against IRA members. British authorities said the three men
were planning a car bomb attack at the site where the Royal Anglian
Regiment band accompanies a weekly changing of the guard ceremony.
   The inquest, which is to hear about 70 witnesses, including the
seven soldiers involved in the shootings, is expected to continue
through the next four weeks.

   Authorities arrested more suspected leftist
terrorists in raids Thursday, the second straight day of raids of
suspected hideouts of the Red Brigades gang in the Rome area, a
police source said.
   Raids on Wednesday netted at least 21 suspects and guns and
grenades found in four different hideouts. The source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, did not say how many were arrested Thursday.
   ``We have won a battle, not the war, against Italian terrorism,
which still can rely on many leaders at large and newcomers with no
penal record and holding jobs in public offices,'' said a police
officer, also speaking privately. He said the raids were continuing.
   Twelve of those arrested at dawn Wednesday were believed to be
members of the Fighting Communist Party, the most active group of
the Red Brigades which was implicated in several assassinations
over the past two years, the officer said.
   The group claimed it assassinated Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, a close
friend and adviser of Christian Democratic Premier Ciriaco De Mita,
in northern Italy in April.
   Two alleged leaders of the Fighting Communist Party _ Fabio
Ravalli and his wife, Maria Cappello _ were among those arrested in
a Rome hideout.
   The weapons seized included two submachine guns believed to be
part of a stock of arms supplied several years ago by Arab
terrorists, police reported.

   Moslem guerrillas shot down an Afghan
military transport plane, killing two army generals and all 14
other people aboard, Afghanistan's government radio said Thursday.
   It said insurgents brought the Antonov-32 transport down
Wednesday with a U.S.-built Stinger missile. The plane carried 12
passengers and four crew members, according to the Kabul radio
report.
   Among the passengers were two brigadier generals, Mohammed
Ismail Noori and Abdul Ahad Razmenda, and Col. Mohammed Hassan
Koshyar, political affairs director for military forces in the
Kunduz region, the radio said. It described Razmenda as a Defense
Ministry lawyer.
   The plane was bound from Kabul to Kunduz City, 160 miles
northeast of Kabul near the Soviet border, the broadcast said.
   Major battles between guerrillas and Soviet and Afghan forces
have been reported in the Kunduz area. Warplanes flying from Soviet
territory bombed insurgent positions late last month.
   The Soviet-made An-32 is a twin-engined turboprop that can carry
39 passengers, 30 paratroopers or 24 stretchers, and is built for
short runways.
   Soviet soldiers began withdrawing from Afghanistan May 15 under
a U.N.-mediated agreement and half the estimated 115,000 had left
by Aug. 15. All are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979. The insurgents were not a party to the agreement reached
April 14 in Geneva and have continued fighting.
   A separate Kabul radio report said two of Pakistan's U.S.-built
F-16 jet fighters intruded into Afghan air space over Asmar in
eastern Kumar province on a reconnaissance mission Wednesday.
   It also quoted the government as denying Pakistan's report that
an Afghan warplane was shot down Wednesday in Pakistani air space.
   Pakistan said Wednesday that four Afghan warplanes flew over its
territory near Nawagai, 12 miles from the border and one was downed
by Pakistani fighters.
   In Geneva, a U.N. official said Afghan refugees will be trained
to dispose of mines left by Soviet and Afghan government forces,
which are estimated to number from hundreds of thousands to
millions.
   The proposed program by the U.N. office coordinating aid for
Afghanistan also calls for public information campaigns to warn
women and children returning to the country about mines.
   ``The first step is to train one or two returnees per village to
have some idea of how to defuse a mine and dispose of it,'' said
the official, an aide to the chief of the Geneva-based office,
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country since the war
began and nearly all live in Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan's
eastern and western neighbors. The Geneva agreement includes
provisions for their return.

   A former nightclub owner and his one-time
bodyguard were charged Thursday in the 1981 bludgeoning murders of
four people in a Laurel Canyon home, authorities said.
   Adel Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash, and his former
bodyguard, Gregory Diles, were charged with four counts of
first-degree murder and the attempted murder of a survivor, said
Andy Reynolds, spokesman for the district attorney's Office. If
convicted, the two could face the death penalty.
   The slayings, near a home owned by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown
Jr., have been one of the city's most notorious unsolved murder
cases.
   Before his death, pornographic film star John Holmes was charged
and acquitted in 1982 of the slayings.
   Prosecutor Ronald S. Coen, now a Superior Court judge, alleged
at trial that Nash ordered the killings in revenge for a robbery at
his Studio City home a day earlier. Nash, who allegedly helped
supply Holmes with drugs, wasn't charged at the time because of
insufficient evidence.
   Killed were William DeVerell, 42, Joy Audrey Miller, 46, Barbara
Richardson, 22, and Ronald Launius, 37. His wife, Susan Launius,
was also beaten but survived.

   A scaled-down version of a Senate-approved
bill authorizing a monument to American women who served in the
Vietnam War was approved Thursday by a House subcommittee.
   The Senate bill, approved 96-1 in mid-June, specifies that a
bronze statue of an Army nurse be erected on the 2.2-acre grounds
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial near the Lincoln Memorial.
   But the measure approved Thursday by the House Administration
subcommittee on libraries and memorials, written as a substitute
for the Senate version, says only that a monument to the 10,000
American women who served in Vietnam can be built somewhere on
federal land in the Washington metropolitan area.
   This will force separate votes by Congress on a specific site
and design for the monument, as well as review by three federal
agencies.
   Critics including Sen. Daniel J. Evans, R-Wash., who cast the
dissenting Senate vote, say a women's statue would violate the
artistic integrity of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and create a
``sculpture garden'' for special-interest groups.
   The names of more than 58,000 U.S. military personnel killed or
missing in the Southeast Asian conflict, which are inscribed on the
black granite wall of the Vietnam memorial, include those of eight
female nurses.
   Some critics have suggested that a tribute to women who served
in Vietnam might be included in a monument to all women of the U.S.
armed forces, which is to be built at the entrance to Arlington
National Cemetery.
   The proposal to erect a women's statue at the Vietnam memorial _
the most popular tourist attraction of all national monuments in
Washington _ has been endorsed by the Interior Department but
opposed by the Commission on Fine Arts and the National Capital
Planning Commission.
   The approval of all three federal agencies is required for the
site, design and construction of any federal monument.
   If the full House Administration Committee approves the
subcommittee's version, as expected, a House vote is tentatively
scheduled for Sept. 19, followed by Senate action.
   Any such monument would be built with private funds and
maintained by the National Park Service.

   A multimillion-dollar kidnapping ransom could be
bankrolling efforts by the Japanese Red Army to disrupt the
Olympics, Japanese news reports said Friday.
   The reports quoted police sources as saying that the Red Army
masterminded a 1986 kidnapping in the Philippines that netted the
terrorist group up to $3 million in ransom.
   Japan warned foreign countries Thursday that the Red Army's
possible windfall from the hefty ransom would increase dramatically
the chances that the terrorist group is planning to disrupt the
Games, which begin a week from Saturday in Seoul, South Korea.
   Red Army members who are under arrest or being sought by
international security authorities used Filipino operatives to
cover their tracks, police sources were quoted in the reports as
saying.
   Nobuyuki Wakaoji, then 53 and head of the Philippine branch of
the Japanese trading giant Mitsui and Co., was kidnapped in
November 1986 by a gun-wielding band of Filipinos as he was
returning home from a golf game.
   He was released four and a half months later after Mitsui
reportedly paid a ransom of up to $3 million. Police, Wakaoji and
Mitsui officials have denied knowledge of any ransom.
   The case strained relations between Manila and Tokyo and
resulted in a drop in Japanese tourism to the Philippines and
worries over Japanese investment in the Southeast Asian country.
   Red Army members Osamu Maruoka, 37, arrested in Tokyo last
November for traveling on a forged passport, and Norio Sasaki, 40,
who is wanted for traveling on a bogus passport, were behind the
kidnapping, the reports said.
   Night duty officers at the National Police Agency and Foreign
Ministry said they could not confirm the reports.
   When Maruoka was arrested he had a one-way plane ticket to
Seoul, leading police to suspect he was planning to set up or make
contact with a radical network to interfere with the Olympics.
   The reports did not say how police concluded that Wakaoji was
kidnapped by the Red Army. It did say that the kidnappers' skillful
manipulation of the Japanese media and similarities with a bungled
Red Army kidnapping case in West Germany in 1974 led police to
suspect a connection with the Japanese terror group.
   ``I never thought it might have been the Red Army,'' Wakaoji
told Kyodo News Service in a telephone interview early Friday.
   ``When I was taken there was no sign of any Japanese, and the
Filipinos spoke among themselves in Tagalog. They never spoke the
names of Maruoka or Sasaki,'' said Wakaoji, who now heads Mitsui's
Sapporo branch in northern Japan.
   The Red Army, formed in the late 1960s, was behind a machine gun
and grenade attack on Lod Airport in Israel in 1972 that left 26
people dead.
   Suspected groups of Red Army members hijacked a Japan Air Lines
jet to North Korea in 1970 and another JAL plane to Saudi Arabia in
1977.
   Italian police are looking for two Red Army members believed to
be behind a bomb blast outside a U.S. military club in Naples in
April. The same month another suspected member was arrested in the
United States in possession of a large amount of explosives.
   The group called for ``simultaneous world revolution'' and had
an estimated 300 members in its heyday. It had been dormant for a
decade until the spate of arrests and incidents in the last year.

   A memorial service will mark the 25th
anniversary of a church bombing that killed four black girls and
focused national attention on the struggle for civil rights in
Alabama's largest city.
   ``In embracing our history there is healing. Join us,'' reads an
invitation from ``The Committee for Sept. 15,'' a group of black
and white Birmingham residents planning the ceremony.
   Four girls, ages 11, 14, and 16, were killed in the 1963
dynamite blast at the 16th Street Baptist Church. The girls were
changing into choir robes in the basement on a Sunday morning when
the blast tore through the room. Twenty-three others were injured.
   The bombing, one of dozens of racially motivated bombings in
Birmingham in the late 1950s and early 1960s, remained unsolved
until 1977, when Robert Edward Chambliss, a white retired auto
mechanic, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Chambliss died in prison in 1985.
   Committee members said the remembrance will give blacks and
whites a chance to remember not just the bombing but the civil
rights struggle.
   ``We as a city are merely looking at ourselves, and saying that
we remember,'' said committee member Bette Lee.
   The Sept. 15 event will feature a number of speakers, including
the Rev. John Cross, pastor of the church in 1963 and now an
official with the Southern Baptist Convention. It will be held at
Kelly Ingram Park, a site adjacent to the church where a civil
rights museum is planned.

<HEAD>Official Says Burundi Assures World Bank of Equality Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burundi, shaken by a wave of ethnic killings
last month, has assured the World Bank that all its citizens share
equally in the benefits of the bank's multimillion-dollar aid
programs for the Central African country, a World Bank official
said Thursday.
   ``We were terribly shocked and dismayed by the tragic events in
Burundi,'' Edward V.K. Jaycox, World Bank vice president for
Africa, told reporters. At least 5,000 people were reported slain
in battles during August between Burundi's ruling Tutsi tribe and
the majority Hutus.
   Bank officials were especially distressed by the violence
because the government that took power in a 1987 coup had ``pushed
forward vigorously'' a policy of equality, Jaycox said. The Hutus
make up 85 percent of the 5 million population but hold relatively
few government or military posts.
   The reforms included elimination of Burundi's internal pass
laws, which ``were oppressive to the majority'' Hutus and
restricted the labor market, Jaycox continued.
   Burundi authorities have assured the World Bank that ``peace and
... inclusion of all Burundians in the development process is the
policy of the government,'' he said.
   The World Bank constantly evaluates its policies in all
countries but there is little it can do to mitigate ethnic violence
beyond seeing that ``our programs are supportive of progress for
all,'' said Jaycox, an American.
   The World Bank lent Burundi 153.5 million dollars during fiscal
1988 for projects promoting agriculture, rural development, health,
nutrition, education, small business and birth control.

<HEAD>House Votes Death Penalty For Murder In Drug Cases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: First 5 grafs new to UPDATE with vote; picks up 6th graf, A
similar.
^By LARRY MARGASAK</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House today amended a $2 billion anti-drug
bill to permit death sentences against those convicted of murder
during drug-related felonies. The vote was 299-111.
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., author of the provision, said it would
be a ``swift and certain'' deterrent to drug killers.
   The death penalty debate was the first major controversy as the
House considered some three dozen amendments to the anti-drug
legislation.
   The provision went one step further than a 410-1 vote earlier
for a mandatory life sentence for drug killers. The capital
punishment provision would give federal judges an additional option
when killings occur during drug crimes.
   The life sentence vote was proposed by Rep. Charles B. Rangel,
D-N.Y., a death penalty opponent who offered his amendment as an
alternative. Only Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., opposed the
Rangel amendment.
   A similar amendment by Gekas was added to an anti-drug bill two
years ago by a 296-112 vote, but the provision was later dropped
after the Senate refused to go along.
   Prospects appear brighter for the death penalty this time,
because the Senate voted 65-29 last June to allow capital
punishment for drug dealers and ``kingpins.'' The Senate has not
yet begun consideration of its own drug bill.
   Other controversial House amendments would: deny student loans
and other federal benefits to convicted drug users, admit illegally
seized evidence in court if police acted in ``good faith'' during a
search, and withhold federal highway money from states that refuse
to revoke or suspend drivers' licenses of convicted drug users.
   As the House conducted a generally mild-mannered debate on the
375-page bill Wednesday, policemen-turned-lobbyists roamed through
lawmakers' offices to present their views on a seven-day waiting
period for handgun purchasers.
   They were not all on the same side in debating this provision of
the drug bill, which includes an optional background check on the
purchaser during the week-long delay.
   Rank-and-file officers supporting the waiting period are part of
a coalition of law enforcement organizations and gun control
groups. The coalition has set up shop in a House Judiciary
Committee basement hearing room in the Rayburn Office Building
across the street from the Capitol.
   Other policemen are lobbying for the National Rifle Association,
which opposes the waiting period and virtually any form of gun
control that affects the general population.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., will try to eliminate the waiting
period. His amendment would substitute an identification system
that would allow gun dealers to check by telephone or other means
to determine whether a purchaser is a convicted felon.
   The Gekas proposal on the death penalty would permit _ but not
require _ a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted
of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony.
   If the death penalty was not imposed, the amendment would
require a sentence of 20 years to life.
   The Senate legislation that passed last June would permit the
death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug
crimes; and for drug ``kingpins,'' defined under law as those who
supervise five or more people, commit at least three federal drug
felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   The only brief moment of emotion during the opening debate
Wednesday came when Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., urged the House
not to ``stoop as low as those killers in the street'' by approving
the death penalty. He said it would be ``beneath the dignity of
this House'' to approve the Gekas language.
   But McCollum rose to Gekas' defense, calling the death penalty
``the missing deterrence'' in the fight against illegal drugs.
   Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable
because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into
compliance with Supreme Court guidelines on capital punishment.
   The overall anti-drug bill provides for money and programs that
would attack drug use from every conceivable direction.
   The legislation would increase spending for federal and state
law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land, in the
air and on the seas.
   Banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of
drug money at legitimate financial institutions. Education programs
would be expanded for youth, including disadvantaged youngsters and
the most hardened gang members. Capacity would be increased, and
waiting periods lessened, for entry into drug rehabilitation
programs.
   The bill encourages Latin American countries to form a regional
anti-narcotics force and pledges financial support if one is
started.
   Federal contractors would be required to maintain a drug-free
workplace. Tight controls would be placed on the U.S.-made
chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin, cocaine and other
drugs.
   States also would be given money to develop programs to stop the
spread of AIDS by intravenous drug abusers.

   A small plane spewing flames and smoke
crashed into a shrimp pond after takeoff Thursday, killing all 10
people aboard, officials and witnesses said.
   The Cesna 421-C crashed about 9 a.m., three minutes after taking
off from the Machala airport on a flight to Quito, 230 miles north,
said government spokesman Cosme Valverde.
   ``The plane was sending smoke and flames from its tail,''
witness Carlos Echevarria said in a radio interview.
   The craft was owned by a small private airline company called
Edsan. The company and Valverde said all eight passengers and two
crew members were killed.
   Listed as dead are pilot Miguel Garamillo, a co-pilot and six
men passengers, a woman and a child whose age and identity was not
determined, officials said.
   The officials said the craft crashed into ponds on a shrimp
farm, but said they did not know the cause of the accident. The
company said investigators were sent to the crash site.
   In the last major plane crash in Ecuador, 10 top air force
officials and an Israeli military attache were killed June 3 when
their plane crashed into a mountain near Quito.

   Anti-nuclear protesters shouted ``Good
riddance!'' Thursday as the first American cruise missiles to leave
Europe under U.S.-Soviet arms treaty were flown home for
destruction.
   Two of the 18 cruise missiles deployed at nearby Molesworth U.S.
Air Base were loaded on a C-141 and their 55-foot mobile launchers
aboard a C-5 Galaxy for the 12-hour flight to Davis-Monthan Air
Force Base near Tucson, Ariz. They are to be broken up at the base
under the eye of Soviet inspectors.
   The missiles arrived unannounced less than a year ago, but their
departure was public.
   They were encased in canisters atop camouflage-painted launchers
that lumbered from Molesworth under police escort, past the base
insignia of U.S. and British flags crossed over the slogan ``Peace
Through Partnership,'' then along seven miles of rural lanes to
Alconbury.
   As the two mobile launchers and a launch training vehicle moved
out of Molesworth about 40 anti-nuclear protesters rushed forward
and showered the convoy with their peace symbol, multicolored paper
petals. They shouted ``Go home!'' and ``Good riddance! Don't come
back!''
   Several Hare Krishna followers in white and gold robes joined
the protesters, softly beating drums and tambourines.
   Police grabbed one protester who tried to run toward the lead
vehicle shouting, ``What about the warheads?''
   Destruction of the warheads is not required under the superpower
Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. They were not in the convoy and
American officials said they would be returned to the United States
``in due course.''
   The agreement to eliminate the approximately 2,700 Soviet and
U.S. land-based nuclear missiles from Europe by 1991 was signed by
President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev last December and
ratified by the Senate in May.
   Some Soviet SS-20s aimed at Western Europe were removed in
February and nine Pershing 2 missiles were taken from a West German
base Sept. 1.
   Cruise missiles first arrived in Europe in November 1983 and
were deployed at the Greenham Common base west of London. It now
has 96 missiles.
   Missiles deployed at Molesworth were the last to arrive, in
November 1987, and Defense Secretary George Younger said they will
be gone within three months.
   Younger declared at a news conference in a Molesworth hangar
that, despite Gorbachev's policies of reform, the Soviet Union
remains on the military offensive.
   U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II said the world was now
``marginally safer'' and added: ``We are are witnessing the removal
of the cruise missiles because we, the NATO allies, have been
strong and united.''
   ``We are not here because some individuals, well-intentioned and
innocent of the world's realities, kept vigils at our bases,'' he
said, referring to protesters who have camped outside Greenham and
Molesworth.
   Younger said the treaty and missile removal was ``a stinging
rebuke'' to those who had sought unilateral Western disarmament.
   Outside the gates of Molesworth, members of the anti-nuclear
movement saw it differently.
   ``We're delighted that the missiles are going. We've kept up the
pressure on this government ... and we claim part of the credit,''
said Meg Beresford, secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament. ``But we are very concerned about the possibility of
new weapons being brought in which certainly break the spirit of
the treaty.''
   She expressed fear that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government will accept U.S. F-111 bombers carrying air-launched
cruise missiles, which are not banned by the treaty.
   Younger did not deny Britain may deploy new U.S. air- or
sea-launched nuclear missiles, as well as maintaining its own
nuclear arsenal. He said Britain will keep nuclear weapons ``to
deter, in such numbers and at such locations as are necessary.''

   President Reagan reminded Congress on Thursday
that some 10 million more women than men will be voting this fall,
and criticized legislators for not acting on some 40 female
appointees he's named.
   ``The hand that pulls the voting lever rules the nation,''
Reagan quipped at a Rose Garden ceremony honoring a group of female
administration executives.
   The Republican party is said to suffer from the so-called gender
gap, in which the party has a lower level of support from women
than the Democrats.
   But Reagan argued against that idea, saying he believed that
neither men, nor women, vote as a bloc.
   ``They look at the record and vote on the issues _ and those are
the people who, on election day, will decide the outcome,'' Reagan
said.
   The president took the opportunity to lambast Congress, faulting
the fact that some 40 females he's nominated to senior executive,
advisory and judicial posts have not been approved.
   ``The liberal ledership in the Senate can talk about their
interest in women taking senior positions in government, but
they're not delivering,'' Reagan charged.
   ``They say they applaud the idea of putting more women on the
bench. Well, if so, let them expeditiously move to confirm the five
excellent judicial nominees they have before them,'' Reagan said.
   In his remarks, Reagan boasted that out of the 10 women who have
served in Cabinet posts, four have served during his term.
   He also noted that he had been the first to appoint a woman,
Sandra Day O'Connor, to the Supreme Court.
   ``You do represent the leading edge, as I say, of the great
progress for American women, and because of what all of you and so
many other women have done, even greater opportunities for women
lie ahead,'' Reagan said.
   ``The progress that we're witnessing is just the beginning and
it can only move in one direction: it can only move forward,'' he
added.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grew $2.6 Billion In July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $2.6 billion more in
consumer credit than they paid off in July, a sharp slowdown from
the pace of growth during the first half of the year, the
government reported Thursday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit expanded at an
annual rate of just 4.8 percent last month, down from an annual
rate of 10.2 percent from January through June.
   The report said the slowdown reflected a drop in auto sales in
July and lackluster sales of other consumer goods.
   Consumer credit had shot up $8.1 billion in June, even faster
than originally believed. A month ago, the Fed had estimated the
June advance at a smaller $5.4 billion.
   Mike Evans, head of his own Washington economic consulting firm,
said that the July slowdown showed that consumers are remaining
fairly cautious about the future in spite of the fact that wage
gains picked up in July.
   ``Consumers don't seem to be buying big-ticket items as they had
in the past and that probably reflects the increases in interest
rates,'' he said.
   The Federal Reserve has been tightening credit since late March
in an effort to dampen demand as a way of cooling inflationary
pressures.
   The smaller July increase was led by a $2 billion rise in the
category which includes credit card debt. This followed a $3.7
billion June increase.
   Auto loans increased by $555 million in July, down sharply from
a $2.8 billion June advance.
   The category which includes bank and credit union loans not
secured by real estate declined by $62 million after a $1.4 billion
June increase.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at $646.9 billion,
up 9 percent from a year ago.

<TEXT>
   At least 27 black activists,
including leaders of two banned organizations, have been detained
in an apparent crackdown on opposition to Oct. 26 elections,
newspapers reported Thursday.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of several clergymen to
defy emergency regulations by urging an election boycott, repeated
his call Thursday.
   Addressing about 2,000 people at the predominantly mixed-race
University of the Western Cape, Tutu said of next month's local
elections:
   ``Please consider prayerfully what God wants you to do. We want
to urge black people _ do not take part in a process which will
perpetuate your oppression.''
   The archbishop called on whites to join the boycott ``because
the time of white politics is past.''
   Police headquarters declined to comment on the reported
detentions. It also has declined to give details of an
investigation on whether Tutu should be prosecuted for urging an
election boycott.
   The anti-apartheid weekly New Nation said the detentions in the
past two weeks are believed to be part of a government attempt to
stifle opposition to the elections, which will mark the first time
voters of all races go to the polls on the same day.
   Many blacks oppose taking part in segregated local elections as
long as the black majority cannot vote in national elections.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, said the activists
detained this week included Nkosi Molala, president of the Azanian
People's Organization.
   Molala's organization was one of 17 anti-apartheid groups banned
in February from conducting any activities. It espouses the
philosophy of black consciousness, or black self-reliance,
developed by Steve Biko before his death in detention in 1977.
   New Nation said 14 members of the South African Youth Congress,
another of the banned groups, have been detained since last week.
It said all top leaders of the Youth Congress now are in detention.
   New Nation, whose editor Zwelakhe Sisulu has been detained
without charge for nearly two years, said 12 other activists from
the Pretoria area were detained Wednesday.
   Two of them worked for the Community Research and Information
Service, a social service group which has expressed fears about the
life of another black staff member, Stanza Bopape.
   Police say Bopape escaped three days after being detained June
9. His family and associates have not heard from him since, and
fear he may have been killed.
   Security police have seized two tape recordings of a sermon
given by Tutu on Sunday in which he advocated an election boycott.
Such calls are punishable by up to 10 years in jail.
   In his speech Thursday, Tutu explained his defiance.
   ``It is not because Tutu is trying to look smart,'' he said. ``I
have a commitment and a passion for South Africa. We have the
potential of being one of the greatest countries. My passion makes
me able, whatever the penalties, to do what I believe God is asking
me to do.''

<TEXT>
   A professor who said researchers have
concluded the Shroud of Turin is a fake was only guessing, says the
head of an Oxford University team researching the relic believed to
be Christ's burial cloth.
   The Oxford Mail on Thursday quoted Prof. Edward Hall, director
of the archaeology research laboratory at Oxford, as saying results
of the research were still secret.
   But Dr. Richard Luckett of Cambridge University, the professor
who last month quoted researchers as saying the shroud was a
medieval forgery, said he stood by his word.
   Hall condemned as ``mere guesswork'' a statement by Luckett that
tests at Oxford showed the shroud was made in 1350, the newspaper
said.
   ``The person who has been doing the dating told me that Dr.
Luckett got the date completely wrong,'' Hall was quoted as saying.
   The shroud is kept in Turin cathedral in Italy. Cardinal
Anastasio Ballestrero of Turin sent tiny samples to university
research laboratories in Arizona, Zurich and Oxford for tests to
try to determine its age.
   Hall told the Oxford Mail that the results probably would not be
announced until after the end of this month, after statisticians in
Turin, Ballestrero's scientific advisers and Pope John Paul II were
informed.
   Luckett wrote in London's Evening Standard newspaper Aug. 26:
``I think that as far as seems possible the scientific argument is
now settled and the shroud is a fake.''
   Hall said he was on vacation when Luckett's statement was
published. It provoked an outcry from Italian experts on the shroud
who accused the British of leaking the results.
   ``I cannot say what the true date is, but it is certainly not
the one he gave. I am sure Dr. Luckett has not had any information.
Whatever his evidence, he has no business to make uninformed
comment,'' Hall was quoted as saying.
   On Wednesday Luckett said his information came from researchers.
   ``It's ridiculous of these people to pretend there weren't any
leaks. I had an absolutely marvelous leak from one of the
laboratories and it wasn't Oxford,'' Luckett said in a telephone
interview from Magdalene College, Cambridge.
   ``It would be surprising if one laboratory contradicted
another,'' he added.
   Luckett, a fellow of Magdalene College, librarian and a
historian of the 17th century who has been interested in the shroud
for many years, said: ``Nobody has ever bridged the gaps in the
historical evidence for the shroud.''
   ``I'm now fairly clear that the shroud is more than 100 years
older than I once thought, but I always assumed it was medieval,''
he said.
   ``I think the tests should have been done entirely in secret and
then announced. As for having no business to comment, I wasn't
asked last month for a news report but to comment on an assumption
about the shroud's age,'' Luckett said.
   References to such a shroud go back as early as the 5th or 6th
centuries but then there are gaps, between reports of witnesses in
the 12th and early 13th centuries and its turning up in France in
1354.
   In 1389, the shroud was denounced as a forgery by Bishop Pierre
d'Arcis of Troyes in France, who said in a letter that his
predecessor knew who painted it. The painter's name does not appear
in any known document.

<DATELINE>LOXAHATCHEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were charged with poaching an
alligator, less than a week into Florida's legal alligator hunt.
   One of the men, 20-year-old Eric Brooks, had lost in the lottery
to license 238 hunters, said Burkett Neely, manager of the Arthur
R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.
   Each licensed hunter is permitted to take up to 15 gators in
designated areas this month as part of the state's first hunt in a
quarter-century. But no one is permitted to hunt alligators or
disturb any animal or plant in the refuge.
   John Tommie, 24, was allowed to post bond Wednesday, and Brooks
was likely to be released Friday, according to attorneys.
   Brooks and Tommie, who said they work as roofers in Loxahatchee,
were arrested Monday as they drove out of a refuge entrance.
   They were wet after their canoe tipped in the L-7 canal and they
had a .22-caliber rifle, a flashlight and a 28-inch section of
alligator tail, Neely said.
   After the arrest, ``Brooks stated that he and Tommie knew there
were lots of `lizards in the canal' and decided to go out and get
some,'' court documents said.
   Later, the officers found a dead, tailless alligator with
multiple gunshot wounds, Neely said.
   Although estimates place the alligator population in Florida at
1 million, federal law considers the alligator to be ``threatened
by similarity,'' Neely said.
   He said that the American alligator looks similar to the
American crocodile, which is endangered. In order to protect the
refuge's crocodiles, alligators are also protected.

<HEAD>Capital Homicides Already At Total For Previous Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With almost four months remaining in 1988, the
nation's capital has matched the number of homicides _ 227 _ that
occurred in all of last year.
   The shooting death of the latest victim, a 17-year-old boy, was
drug related _ as were three out of every five of the homicides
this year, police said.
   ``Homicides and shootings go hand in hand with drugs,'' said
Metropolitan Police Chief Maurice Turner.
   In addition, the number of assaults involving guns have climbed
to more than 940 so far this year, an increase of at least 54
percent, Turner said.
   ``The numbers are astounding,'' he added.
   Until the demand for drugs decreases, Turner predicted the city
will see ``more homicides and more shootings.''
   Police spokesman Capt. William White III estimated that if
homicides continue at the current pace, 335 persons will be killed
in Washington this year _ far exceeding the all-time record of 287,
set in 1969.
   So far, 95 homicides this year, including the latest, remain
unsolved.
   During August, there were 41 Washington homicides, a record for
one month. The old standard of 37 was set in January.
   Police blame the upsurge on the growing popularity of crack, a
highly-potent cocaine derivative.
   Many of the killings have come in turf battles as drug dealers
have fought for selling rights for the drug in the city's 88
open-air drug markets, according to police.
   Of the 227 homicides so far this year, 156 have involved
firearms, White said. Last year, guns were used in 129 homicides.

   Doctors in a California hospital will
search for a donor heart to be transplanted into a child at birth,
an operation performed only once before, officials said Thursday.
   Cynthia Petersen of Murray, Utah, who is 33 weeks pregnant, was
to fly to Loma Linda University Medical Center on Thursday night to
await a suitable donor heart for her fetus.
   ``Baby Paul'' from Canada is the only other baby with the heart
defect known as hypoplastic left ventricle to have had a transplant
right after birth, doctors said. The baby, who was operated on at
Loma Linda 11 months ago, is growing normally, authorities said.
   Mrs. Petersen's obstetrician found an abnormal fetal heart beat
during a pre-natal examination and referred her to Dr. Greggory
DeVore, director of the Intermountain Fetal Diagnostic and
Treatment Center at Salt Lake's LDS Hospital.
   DeVore said the left chamber of the heart does not develop with
the fetus' condition, and most babies who have it die within three
to four weeks of birth.
   Doctors at Loma Linda will monitor the fetus while they look for
a donor. If a donor is found, DeVore said doctors will perform
surgery immediately following the birth.
   ``When the baby is born, the immune system of the infant is not
yet keyed in to reject a donor organ, '' DeVore said.
   ``We know there is only a 50 percent chance they will even
locate a donor, but we are optimistic,'' said Mrs. Petersen's
husband, Daymon.
   ``The more people know about this, the better,'' Mrs. Petersen
said.
   The fetus was named Whitney Ray Petersen in advance by his
parents. The Petersens have two other children, a 5-year-old girl
and a 2-year-old boy. Petersen is a maintenance worker for the Utah
National Guard and Mrs. Petersen is a nurse.
   The Petersens' insurance company will not cover the
$100,000-plus pricetag of the surgery. The couple said they don't
know how they are going to pay it.
   DeVore said Mrs. Petersen and the baby will be required to stay
near the hospital for about a year following the operation.
Petersen said he would return to Utah after his wife is settled at
Loma Linda and will try to visit her whenever finances permit.

<HEAD>Iran Says Talks May Move to New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister said Thursday his
delegation will stay in Geneva as long as needed, but the stalled
U.N.-mediated peace talks with Iraq may adjourn soon and move to
New York.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati accused Iraq of
trying to ``derail the discussions'' by introducing such
``extraneous elements'' as freedom of navigation in the Persian
Gulf and conflicting claims to the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which
forms the southern frontier.
   Velayati told reporters Iran ``is eager to continue these talks
at any level deemed appropriate by the secretary-general.''
Negotiations began Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire halted the
8-year-old war, with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
as mediator.
   Velayati said Iran agreed in principle ``with small
reservations'' to a compromise formula proposed by Jan Eliasson,
the Swedish diplomat who has temporarily replaced Perez de Cuellar
as mediator, but Iraq rejected it. He gave no details.
   Asked in an interview with Iran's official news agency whether
he foresees early adjournment and a shift of venue to New York, the
site of U.N. headquarters, Velayati replied:
   ``Yes, I think. It will start in maybe two or three weeks from
now, but the ending of this round of talks depends on the decision
of the secretary-general.''
   Velayati said his delegation is ``prepared to stay here as long
as necessary'' and has no objection to resuming direct talks with
the Iraqis, which have not been held since Aug. 26.
   He thanked the U.N. for ``tireless and sincere'' efforts toward
peace.
   In Israel, a military analyst said the United States caused Iran
to accept a cease-fire by increasing its naval strength in the
Persian Gulf.
   Aharon Levran said the war stalemated when Washington sent more
ships in July 1987 to protect shipping, and ``Iran realized that if
it couldn't win the war while confronting Iraq alone, it certainly
could not do so after a superpower like the United States came to
the gulf.''
   Levran, an analyst with Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies, was elaborating on the center's annual Middle
East Military Balance report, published last month. He is a reserve
brigadier general and edited the study.
   Iran accepted the U.N. Security Council's cease-fire resolution
a year after it was adopted unanimously in July 1987.

   Soviet scientists have lost contact with
an unmanned spacecraft hurtling toward Mars, one of two probes
designed to orbit the red planet and study its moon Phobos, a NASA
official said Thursday.
   A Soviet message to NASA headquarters in Washington didn't say
whether the problem endangered Phobos 1's mission to Mars, said
Raymond J. Amorose, Deep Space Network operations manager at the
space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``They said they had lost communications with Phobos 1 ... but
Phobos 2 is in fine shape,'' he said. ``They have not asked for our
help. We have offered, and they said they do not need our help
yet.''
   Soviet media was silent on the matter Thursday.
   The problem is jeopardizing a joint U.S.-Soviet study of the sun
planned for this month, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
   Phobos 1 was to have worked with NASA's Solar Maximum
spacecraft, which has been orbiting Earth for almost a decade, to
view the sun from different angles, providing the first
stereoscopic images of the sun.
   Phobos 1 was launched July 7 and Phobos 2 on July 12. During the
$480 million mission, the two probes were scheduled to go into
orbit around Mars and just behind Phobos in January so they could
study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Plans called for Phobos 1 to drop a lander onto the moon Phobos
on April 7, and for Phobos 2 to deploy its lander _ nicknamed the
``hopper'' because it literally would hop around the moon's surface
_ on May 25, Amorose said.
   Starting Oct. 10, NASA was to help track both probes with its
Deep Space Network, which consists of 230-foot, dish-shaped radio
antennas in Goldstone, Calif.; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid,
Spain, Amorose said.
   The purpose is to help the Soviets ``navigate the spacecraft to
their aim points at Mars'' and also help receive data transmitted
to Earth by the two probes, he added.
   Solar Max and Phobos 1 were to perform their solar studies later
this month and again after Phobos 1 deploys its lander.
   The images from the spacecraft would allow scientist to study
the narrow layer of hot gases on the sun's surface, said research
scientist Keith Strong of Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. in Palo
Alto, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Sheelah Ryan was ``just churning
inside'' when she walked over to her neighbors' house and blurted
out that she had won the record $55 million Florida lottery, says
her friend Nancy Damron.
   And Ms. Ryan, 63, kept saying, ``Everything is just too big.
It's just hard to believe.''
   When Ms. Ryan showed up at their door on Tuesday, ``She was so
upset she could hardly talk,'' said Mrs. Damron. ``I thought, `Oh,
my God, something's wrong.''
   But she only wanted Mrs. Damron and her husband, Jim, to watch
her neat mobile home and her cats and feed the wild birds that come
to her yard daily, because she would be out of town for a few days.
   Was it an illness or a death in the family? the Damrons wondered.
   Then she told them, ``I'm sure I won the lottery.''
   ``I don't think Sheelah really believed it herself when she came
over,'' Mrs. Damron said.
   ``She told us she had already gotten a lawyer and they'd called
Tallahassee, so she knew she had the right numbers,'' Mrs. Damron
said.
   Ms. Ryan flew to the capital Wednesday and presented her ticket,
becoming the richest lottery winner in the U.S. history.
   Before she returned to this Central Florida community, phone
calls began pouring into her home. They included calls from
well-wishers, marriage proposals, requests for money and people
claiming to be relatives, said two security guards who fielded the
calls.
   One caller even wanted her to accompany him on a trip to India.
   In an interview Thursday on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Ms.
Ryan said, ``The only downside is my lack of sleep and what I feel
is a great deal of stress for doing something that I'm not familiar
with, and that is being in the limelight.''
   A person answering the phone at her house Thursday afternoon
said she was spending the day with friends.
   After realizing she had the winning numbers in Saturday night's
drawing, Ms. Ryan contacted two attorneys. On their advice, she
spent the Labor Day weekend at home.
   She said she became upset about speculation on television about
who the Lotto winner was, and the story that a North Florida school
janitor claimed to have the winning ticket.
   But the part-time real estate saleswoman told a press conference
at the Lottery Department's headquarters that her main reason for
coming forward Wednesday was not to dispel the rumors.
   ``I came forward to pick up $55 million,'' she said. ``No one
waits for that kind of money.''
   Ms. Ryan, who is single and lives alone, didn't tell reporters
what she plans to do with the money. And the Damrons said they
could only guess.
   ``One thing she said she'd like to get is a car that wouldn't
wake up her neighbors every time she starts it,'' Damron said,
pointing toward Ms. Ryan's well-worn Mercury.
   ``She told me she'd kind of like to stay here with her friends
and maybe even keep her job,'' Mrs. Damron said.
   Ms. Ryan's only real hobby is her cats, they said.
   ``She just adores those cats,'' Mrs. Damron said.

   North Korea accused America and Japan on
Thursday of trying to involve the United Nations in a scheme to
perpetuate the division of Korea by inviting South Korean diplomats
to address the General Assembly.
   North Korean Ambassador Pak Gil Yon told reporters ``attempts to
create an atmosphere for creation of so-called `two Koreas' on the
40th anniversary of the establishment of the South Korean
government will only help expand the confrontation between the
North and South.''
   South and North Korea are not member nations of the United
Nations, but have permanent observer missions.
   Pak was reacting to a request by the United States, Japan,
Britain, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Oman
and Morocco that South Korea be allowed to address this fall's
General Assembly on the occasion of its anniversary as an
independent nation.
   Pak complained that the discussion ``will involve the United
Nations and its members in the crafty moves of the United States
and South Korea to have the present division of Korea and the
so-called `two Koreas' legalized.''
   ``The United States and Japan are working to get the United
Nations and its members entangled in their attempts to freeze the
division of Korea,'' he said.
   Pak asked the sponsors to withdraw the request.
   The United Nations sponsored national assembly elections in
South Korea that resulted in creation of the Seoul government on
Aug. 15, 1948.
   U.N. officials wanted to hold the elections in the entire Korean
peninsula, but Soviet occupation forces that remained in the North
after World War II refused to allow them into the North.
   The Communists in the North announced formation of their
goverment on Sept. 9, 1948. Both governments claim to represent the
entire Korean peninsula.

<HEAD>Lutheran Ministers Want Extra Pay to Sunday Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national organization of Lutheran
ministers on Thursday called for extra pay for work on Sundays.
   ``There's nothing wrong with that,'' the national news agency
NTB quoted Knut Lein, the head of the group, as saying. ``All other
working groups, including parish clerks and organ players, get
extra pay for Sunday work, or for working inconvenient hours.''
   Regular weekly services in Norwegian churches are held on
Sundays.
   The request for a pay increase is part of a 1988-1990 program
adopted by the National Association of Priests, or
Presteforeningen, as it closed its annual general assembly
Thursday, NTB reported.
   ``We're just asking that regulations concerning working life
should apply to us as well,'' Lein said, adding priests receive low
wages.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church is Norway's national church and
is supported by the state. The ministers are paid by their local
governments. Other religious groups also are state-subsidized.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts 17-year-old Desegregation Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted a 1971
court order which required the desegregation of Duval County
schools by crosstown busing.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II on Tuesday declared the
school system is integrated and lifted the 17-year-old order,
effectively removing the federal role in the district's
desegregation efforts.
   Moore said he examined the status of students, faculty,
transportation, extracurricular activites and facilities and
determined that segregative practices do not exist.
   He rejected a 1985 lawsuit by the NAACP alleging that the
original 1971 order was not being followed, and also then lifted
the order itself.
   ``I live here, work here and go shopping here,'' the judge
wrote. ``And the feeling I get is that the leadership of the NAACP
is promoting this lawsuit, contrary to the rank and file of the
black people of this community.''
   Despite the ruling, Willye Dennis, the leader of the
Jacksonville branch of the NAACP, said the civil rights
organization stands by its claim that the school system is not
desegregated.
   ``We need to get the message out to the community that if this
case is not appealed, we are going to be in a bind,'' she said,
adding that a decision has not been reached on whether to appeal.
   As a result of the ruling, the school system will be free to
redraw boundary lines, reduce crosstown busing and set its own
standards for an integrated school system, said Jannell Byrd, an
attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York
City.
   School Board Chairman Billy Parker said Thursday that there
would be no immediate changes, but he predicted that at least 25
percent of the students now being bused could be returned to
neighborhood schools next fall.
   Parker said ``some busing for racial desegregation will continue
in places where it is impossible to return to local schools and
still keep an integrated school system.''
   ``There's no question that every place where youngsters can
return to neighborhood schools, a move will be made to do so,'' he
said.
   The school system has 104,000 students, 35 percent of them
black. About 30 percent of the teachers and 25 percent of the
faculty are black, the court order said.
   Duval County buses 20,000 students each day. Officials have said
that 45 percent of the busing is for integration. Many students
riding buses from 25 minutes to an hour each way during the school
year.
   In his ruling, Moore said the school system had done a
reasonable job of attempting to maintain racial balance at the
schools, but he said practical problems got in the way.
   Moore wrote that Duval County is so large, about two-thirds the
size of Rhode Island, that it is difficult to rectify racial
imbalance brought about by shifts in population patterns by busing.

<TEXT>
   Mumps, the once-common childhood disease, is
declining again after two years on the rise, federal health
officials reported Thursday.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported that mumps was down by
two-thirds through the first 30 weeks of this year, with 3,166
cases reported in that time.
   The CDC also reported details of a mumps outbreak last year in
three Chicago financial markets, which illustrated the potential
seriousness of the usually mild disease; the costs from the 116
cases averaged nearly $1,500 per patient.
   Mumps reached a record low in the United States in 1985, when
2,982 cases were reported _ down 98 percent from the 152,000
reported in 1968, the first year for the licensed mumps vaccine.
Mumps reporting then rose over the next two years, to 7,790 cases
in 1986 and 12,299 in preliminary reports from 1987.
   The cases reported in the first 30 weeks of 1988 mark a 67
percent drop from the same period in 1987, the CDC said.
   The report made no speculation on this year's decrease.
   Recent outbreaks have occurred in high schools and on college
campuses. The CDC noted that those outbreaks would include some
people who may not have been vaccinated, because they were children
between 1967, when the vaccine was first licensed, and 1977, when
it was added to the list of vaccines recommended for all children
over 1 year.
   One major outbreak last year occurred among an older group _
employees at three futures exchanges in Chicago. Between Aug. 18
and Dec. 25, 76 cases occurred at one exchange, 39 cases occurred
at a second exchange and one more case occurred at a third exchange.
   The patients at the three exchanges _ which were not identified
_ could not be positively linked, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   But researchers believe there may have been contacts between the
three locations which could not be documented, said Dr. Karen
Kaplan, a CDC epidemiologist.
   The CDC was able to get vaccination information for 82 patients;
more than one-third believed they had been immunized against mumps,
but only three could prove it with records.
   ``The vaccine is how this could have been averted,'' Ms. Kaplan
said. ``We suggest that adults have a complete immunization record
(with all recommended shots). ... But nobody thinks about adult
immunization.''
   The costs associated with the 116-patient outbreak _ including
doctors' visits, hospitalization for nine patients, medications and
missed work _ came to $120,738, or $1,473 a case, the CDC said.
   That, the CDC said, ``contrasted dramatically with the cost of
mumps vaccine'' _ less than $5 a dose at public clinics, about $9
at a doctor's office.
   Mumps, which causes painful swelling in the neck, is usually
mild but can cause serious problems in other parts of the body,
particularly in adolescents and young adults. Serious complications
can include deafness, orchitis in the testicles and meningitis or
encephalitis in the nervous system.

   Ethnic rivals traded gunfire from
rooftops Thursday and the death toll from a night of clashes rose
to at least six, witnesses and officials said.
   Hospitals confirmed the deaths and estimated about 30 people
were wounded.
   Some witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed the
latest unrest began Wednesday night when Sind province nationalists
left a protest rally and began firing at random around the city.
   Police said they cleared the streets but that on Thursday,
rooftop sniping broke out between Sind National Alliance members
and their rivals, the Mohajirs, who come from other Pakistan
provinces and from India.
   Hyderabad, a volatile southern city of 1 million, has spent
nearly one month out of the past three under curfew, with troops
patrolling the streets. About 30 people died in ethnic violence
over the summer.

   The fire that cut telephone service for 42,000
customers for as long as 26 days was not arson but the cause is
still unknown, according to a report Thursday.
   A preliminary report on the fire that destroyed an Illinois Bell
Co. switching station in Hinsdale offers few conclusions, but said,
``No evidence has been found that the (blaze) was deliberate.''
   The report was prepared by Forensic Technologies International
Corp. of Annapolis, Md., and adopted as the official, preliminary
summary by the staff of the Illinois Commerce Commission.
   ``Clearly there is international interest in what is going on
with this investigation,'' said ICC spokesman David Farrell.
``Other telecommunications companies throughout the world want to
prevent what happened in May in Hinsdale.
   ``This appears to be one of the largest telecommunications
disasters that has ever occurred,'' he said.
   Forensic Technologies is expected to release its final report in
November, Farrell said. The company was hired by the ICC, but
Illinois Bell is paying the bill _ $290,000 so far, he said.
   At first, the Mother's Day fire was expected to be only a minor
inconvenience for residents in Du Page County. But as Illinois Bell
crews examined the damaged hardware, it was clear that what became
known as the Great Phone Outage would last more than a few days.
   It wasn't until June 4 that full telephone service was restored.
   The fire in the switching station started in the ceiling, in
metal trays that hold cable above the telecommunication equipment,
the report said.
   ``The fire department's use of water produced an immediate
reduction of flame and heat,'' the report says. ``However, because
the building power supply was designed to be very reliable, the
source of electric power was continuous and the fire rekindled.
   Illinois Bell is conducting its own investigation and expects to
release its report in November, spokeswoman Pat Montgomery said.

<TEXT>
   George Bush's son defended his father's error
on the date of Pearl Harbor Day but in the process got it wrong
himself during a radio talk show Thursday.
   Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, said during a
speech to the American Legion Wednesday that the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor occurred on Sept. 7, 1941 _ not on Dec. 7, one of the
best-known dates in U.S. history.
   George Bush Jr., during a discussion about the campaign with
Michael Jackson, the syndicated talk show host, lamented on
Thursday that ``the problem is that so much of what we see in
presidential politics is the 15-second sound bite on TV.''
   ``Last night for example, the 15-second sound bite on my dad on
the national networks was the fact that he slipped for 45 seconds
on whether Pearl Harbor was on Sept 9 or Dec. 9.
   ``And they made a big deal of that on TV. I didn't quite get the
point, because he, you know, corrected himself.''
   Jackson did not note the younger Bush's mistake during the
interview.
   Vice President Bush said Wednesday, ``I wonder how many
Americans remember. Today is Pearl Harbor Day. Forty-seven years
ago to this very day we were hit, and hit hard at Pearl Harbor. We
were not ready.
   ``In a Bush administration, that lesson would not be forgotten.''
   Within a minute or so, after prompting from the audience and
from others on the speakers' platform, Bush corrected himself.

   With a deafening roar and towering clouds
of white smoke, two nuclear-missile rocket motors were destroyed
Thursday, the first U.S. weapons eliminated under the arms
reduction treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Vice President George Bush and a 12-member Soviet inspection
team were among hundreds of observers who watched the burnings at
the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in northeast Texas, about 145
miles east of Dallas.
   Afterward, the Soviet team said it was satisified with the
burnings.
   Last week, American observers went to the Soviet Union to
witness the destruction of missiles there under terms of the
U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   ``This is the day we begin to reverse the arms race. This was
the day we began to destroy the weapons of destruction,'' Bush said
after the missles were destroyed. ``This was the day that two great
nuclear powers began to move together toward a safer, more peaceful
world.''
   Under the treaty, signed in Washington last December by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the United
States and Soviet Union are required to destroy all nuclear
missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles within three years.
   At the White House, Reagan said he had asked Bush to attend the
event in his place, and he added, ``I think this step for peace is
something we all can be very proud of.''
   At Longhorn, Army crews ignited the motor of a Pershing 2 missle
and it burned its solid fuel rocket propellant for more than 50
seconds. Next, the motor of a less-powerful Pershing 1-A missile
was burned in about 40 seconds.
   The motors were bolted onto a concrete and steel structure.
   After the firings, the Pershing 1-A casing was placed into a
large hydraulic crusher and flattened as the Soviets and Bush,
using binoculars, looked on. The larger Pershing 2 motor was to be
destroyed later after it cooled down.
   ``We too are sending our INF missiles to the junk yard,'' Bush
said. ``The missile stages we destroyed today are just the
beginning. And over the next three years, the United States will
destroy over 800 more. The Soviets will destroy over 1,800, capable
of delivering roughly four times as many warheads as ours.
   ``And at the end, the levels will be equal _ zero on each
side,'' he said. ``We will have destroyed an entire class of
nuclear missiles and we will have relegated the INF missiles to the
history books. We're witnessing today one of those unique moments
in the career of man, a moment when the tides of history turn and a
new future dawns.''
   Col. Nikolai Chabalin, a senior Soviet inspector, said through
an interpreter: ``We think it is a great event for the Soviet
people, the reduction of two types of nuclear weapons. And today we
have witnessed the fulfillment of a significant event in the
elimination of American missiles under the treaty.''
   The Soviet team will remain in Texas as Longhorn officials plan
eliminations of nine more rocket motors next week, said Don McClow
of the Army Materiel Command in Alexandria, Va.
   Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of the On-site Inspection
Agency, which was formed to implement the treaty, said three other
facilities will join Longhorn as INF elimination sites.
   Officials also will destroy Pershings and their launchers at
Pueblo Depot Activity near Pueblo, Colo., pending approval of a
state permit application, and Pershing launchers will be eliminated
in West Germany. Ground-launched cruise missiles and their
launchers will be destroyed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near
Tucson, Ariz.
   A small group of supporters of Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis and other protesters lined the drive to the plant's
front gate before Bush arrived.
   Dave Harris, a civilian employee with the U.S. Army's Redstone
Arsenal, said Texas officials had reviewed the Army facility's
plans before allowing the burnings, which he said were
environmentally safe.
   The Soviet Union began destroying some of its missiles July 22
and as of Sept. 6 had eliminated 92 rockets.

   Lily Tomlin's bag-lady persona, Trudy, was in the
middle of croaking out a monologue when Ms. Tomlin broke through to
tell a startled opening-night crowd, ``I'm going to have to stop
here.''
   Ms. Tomlin said she had been out sailing on Lake Michigan and as
a result was losing her voice at the first performance here Tuesday
of her one-woman show, ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life
in the Universe.''
   Ms. Tomlin tried to continue Tuesday, after suggesting critics
leave the theater. But after an off-stage consultation, she told
the audience she had decided not to go on because she was ``giving
a mediocre performance and compromising the material. It's not fair
to you.''
   As Ms. Tomlin apologized to the disappointed crowd, she mused on
ways she could make up for the letdown.
   ``I could baby-sit for you,'' she suggested.
   Performances Wednesday and Thursday also were canceled.
   ``Although my voice has improved considerably, I don't feel I
can present my best performance this evening,'' Ms. Tomlin said
Thursday.
   She was expected to perform Friday, however, said Shubert
Theater spokeswoman Kathryn E. McGill.
   Those with tickets for the canceled performances will be
accommodated at another performance or given refunds, theater
officials said.
   The show is scheduled to run through Oct. 23.

<HEAD>Former Cabinet Minister Dies of Heart Attack, 80</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spyros Theotokis, a former foreign
minister who founded a right-wing party and whose father and
grandfather were both premiers of Greece, died of a heart attack,
relatives said Thursday. He was 80.
   Theotokis died Tuesday, his family said.
   Theotokis was born on the Ionian island of Corfu and studied law
in Switzerland and France.
   First elected to Parliament in 1934 with the Popular Party,
Theotokis became public order minister in 1946. He held a string of
Cabinet posts in conservative governments of the 1950s.
   He was appointed foreign minister by Premier Constantine
Caramanlis in 1955 but resigned the following year in a dispute
with Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus over the Mediterranean island's
efforts for independence from British rule.
   Theotokis, a lifelong royalist, resigned his seat in Parliament
in 1974 after the Greek monarchy was abolished in a referendum.
   Together with Stefanos Stefanopoulos, also a former foreign
minister, he founded the right-wing National Front party in 1977.
The party won five seats in the 300-member Parliament in elections
held that year but has not been represented in the house since 1981.
   Theotokis' father, Yannis (also known as John) was briefly prime
minister of a caretaker government in 1935. Theotokis' grandfather,
Georgios, was intermittently prime minister between 1899 and 1909.

<HEAD>Report Says Air Pollutants Must Be Attacked in Combination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air pollutants must be attacked in
combination, not one by one, because that's the way they are
helping to kill trees and stunt crops across the country, an
environmental research group said Thursday.
   Policymakers risk worsening other pollution if they attack a
single pollutant, said James MacKenzie and Mohammed El-Ashry, the
authors of a report for the World Resources Institute.
   For example, current strategies to reduce urban ozone could be
increasing ozone in rural areas, said MacKenzie.
   The Environmental Protection Agency disagreed with that
conclusion.
   The World Resources Institute study said crop losses could be as
large as $5 billion a year from ozone, but they were unable to
estimate monetary damages to forests.
   Dying trees in the East, primarily some pines in the Southeast
and red spruce in the Appalachian Mountains, probably are being
killed by the interaction of ozone and the sulfuric and nitric
acids in acid rain, they said.
   Ozone in rural areas throughout the country appears to be
roughly twice the normal background level, the study said. At high
altitudes in the East it sometimes reaches concentrations the EPA
has defined as unhealthy in cities.
   The American Paper Institute said it was awaiting a response
from its experts before commenting on the report. In the past, the
institute has said it has seen no evidence that trees its member
companies rely on are being harmed by air pollution.
   Like several other environmental groups, the World Resources
Institute argued for a 10-million ton reduction in annual emissions
of the raw material for sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, from power
plant and industrial boilers, and a 5-million ton reduction in
nitrogen dioxide emissions, the raw material for nitric acid, from
boilers and motor vehicles. The two acids are the major components
of acid rain.
   ``We should avoid taking action that corrects one problem at the
expense of others,'' said El-Ashry.
   For example, he said utilities should not be forced to install
expensive ``scrubbers'' to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestacks,
as the current Clean Air Act requires for new plants.
   ``That actually works against the carbon dioxide problem and the
greenhouse effect (warming of the earth),'' he said. The
requirement works to lock in coal to the boilers in question
``rather than allowing fuel switching,'' which would use fuels that
emit less carbon dioxide in burning and thus cause less warming of
the earth.
   Another example is EPA's focus on reducing emissions of one
urban precursor of ozone, reactive hydrocarbons like unburned
gasoline, and ignoring the other precursor, nitrogen oxides,
MacKenzie said.
   ``Those nitrogen oxides will generate ozone in the countryside
and that still comes down as nitric acid,'' he said in arguing that
both should be reduced together.
   The way the chemistry is believed to work, a reduction of urban
nitrogen oxides or a simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides
and hydrocarbons might increase ozone in some urban areas, said
Jennifer Logan, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University.
   Informed of her view, MacKenzie said such an effect is possible
in some areas, and, ``You have to be careful'' to make reductions
in such ways to avoid it.
   The report cited recent research showing that as little as 1
part per billion of nitrogen oxides in forests can form large
amounts of ozone from the hydrocarbons emitted by trees, isoprene
and the terpene family of compounds.
   Ms. Logan said 35 percent of nitrogen oxides are believed to
originate in small cities or rural areas.
   Without new control measures, nitrogen oxides are projected to
increase in coming decades, and ``this means more ozone damage to
the forests,'' MacKenzie said.
   Gerald Emisson, head of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that with computer
models, ``When we have looked at the Northeastern United States on
a very crude scale, we don't see big ozone contrations taking place
if you don't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative results do
not lead us to say there's a big problem in the forests.''

   Nicaragua and Indonesia withdrew Thursday
as candidates to host the 1989 summit of nations professing
non-alignment. The host nation automatically becomes the movement's
chairman for three years.
   Choice of a host country is a major issue at this week's
conference of foreign ministers of the 101-member group.
   Conference spokesman Nicos Agathocleous said neither country
could muster enough support among the 95 nations and organizations
represented at the four-day meeting.
   He said that left the field open for three compromise candidates
_ Cyprus, Malta and Yugoslavia, whose late President Tito helped
found the movement.
   ``There are very intensive and extensive consultations taking
place to find a consensus candidate,'' said Agathocleous, a senior
official of the Cyprus Foreign Ministry.
   Some members oppose Yugoslavia because it was the summit host in
1961 and the tradition is for a nation not to repeat as chairman,
but Agathocleous said that ``is not absolute.''
   Sources said a decision is unlikely until Saturday, the last day
of the ministers' conference.

<TEXT>
   On the eve of Pope John Paul II's fourth
African visit, bishops from nine nations on Thursday urged the
Marxist Mozambique government to talk peace with right-wing rebels.
   
   Archbishop Jaime Goncalves, president of the nine-nation
Inter-Regional Meeting of Bishops of Southern Africa, said ongoing
negotiations to end the 13-year conflict in Angola set the stage
for peaceful dialogue in Mozambique.
   ``Considering the situation in this region where people are
trying to solve conflict through dialogue, Mozambique should also
take part in calling people together to talk about ending the
war,'' Goncalves said. ``Mozambique should take the opportunity
now.''
   Goncalves, addressing a news conference in the capital of
Harare, said the Mozambique government refused to meet with leaders
of the Mozambique National Resistance, also known by the Portuguese
acronym RENAMO.
   Some 70 bishops from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe are gathered in Harare for the meeting.
   The pope will close the 10-day meeting Saturday at the beginning
of his first tour of five black-governed nations neighboring
white-ruled South Africa.
   Goncalves denied the Catholic Church in Mozambique was in direct
confrontation with the government in Maputo.
   ``At first the government said they did not agree with the
Catholic Church. Now they say they understand the position of the
church,'' Goncalves said.
   Mozambique won independence from Portugal in 1975 after
centuries of colonial rule and a decade of guerrilla war waged by
Marxist rebels of Frelimo, the Mozambique Liberation Front. The
front is now the ruling party.
   Frelimo at independence accused the Catholic Church of siding
with the Portuguese in that conflict, but relations between church
and state have since warmed.
   Goncalves said the bishops discussed ``the problem of peace'' in
southern Africa, in line with the theme of the Pope's visit. The
papal tour will emphasize human rights in a region split by ``war
and injustice,'' Goncalves said.
   ``The church must consider what we can do for peace, justice and
welfare in this region,'' said Goncalves, who heads the Catholic
diocese of Beira. That port city is in northern Mozambique, where
RENAMO rebels have been blamed for the slaying of thousands of
civilians.
   The pontiff is scheduled to visit Mozambique before returning to
Rome on Sept. 19.
   Mozambique has accused South Africa of backing RENAMO, a charge
denied by Pretoria.
   Zimbabwe has about 12,000 troops fighting alongside government
forces in Mozambique and has repeatedly opposed dialogue with the
rebels.
   Both the Harare and Maputo governments argue the guerrillas have
no specific ideological aims and are simply terrorists supported by
South Africa.

<HEAD>Army Flies Aid to Refugees; Flood Damage to Crops Estimated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An army airlift is carrying relief
supplies to a refugee camp 500 miles southwest of Khartoum where 40
people a day have been dying of starvation, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   Al-Ayam said the airlift had supplied the El-Meiram camp with
canned goods and 1,000 sacks of sorghum so far.
   Relief official El-Tayeb Tahir told reporters a trainload of
relief material arrived at El-Meiram last Monday and the Transport
Ministry had been asked to allocate one train a week for the south.
   Thousands of southern Sudanese displaced by civil war, drought
and recent floods have been moving north and many die of starvation
or disease on the way.
   On Thursday, a month after the floods, the government said it
estimates the damage to crops at about $365 million. Unofficial
estimates put the cost much higher.
   The Rev. Aengus Finucane, director of the Irish aid agency
CONCERN, said last month 40 people were dying every day at
El-Meiram and starvation threatened about 2 million Sudanese in the
south.
   According to Al-Ayam's report, the army stepped in when
international relief groups said they could not move goods to the
south because of the heavy rains and floods.
   It did not mention the proximity of rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army forces besieging Wau, 160 miles from the El-Meiram
camp.
   Rebel gunners shot down two civilian planes in 1986 and 1987 and
the insurgent army, led by former Col. John Garang, has threatened
to fire on relief planes. The rebels claim the government uses
civilian aircraft to move ammunition and troops.
   Garang's rebels began fighting the Moslem-dominated Khartoum
government in 1983. They seek autonomy for the south, most of whose
people are Christians or animists, and claim to control more than
90 percent of the countryside.
   Tahir said without elaboration that contacts were under way on
arrangements for international agencies to fly aid to the south,
but a Western official said privately the rebels were reluctant to
approve such an airlift.

<HEAD>Agreement Set On Streamlining Mortgages</HEAD>

   The country's two largest purchasers of home
mortgages announced Thursday that they have reached agreement on
ways to streamline and simplify the often time-consuming process of
obtaining a home mortgage.
   The agreement was reached between the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., known as Freddie Mac, and the Federal National Mortgage
Association, known as Fannie Mae. Both corporations buy mortgages
from primary lenders and resell them as mortgage-backed securities,
thus increasing the pool of money available to make home loans.
   The two companies along with the Federal Housing Administration,
the Veterans Administration and the Government National Mortage
Association have been participating for the past year in a task
force seeking to standardize and simplify the mortgage application
process.
   John Teutsch, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, an
organization of local lenders, said the agreement between Freddie
Mac and Fannie Mae was an important first step and should set the
stage for more progress in the future.
   The mortgage group estimated that further progress could
eventually cut in half the time it takes to get a mortgage
approved. At present, this waiting period ranges from 45 to 60 days.
   ``During the past 50 years, the mortgage origination process had
become unnecessarily complicated for both consumers and lenders
alike. It was time to turn back the tide of paperwork,'' Teutsch
said.
   Teutsch said at a news conference that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac had both agreed to revise their mortgage eligibility
requirements and underwriting guidelines to make them more uniform.
   This is critical because local lenders follow these guidelines
closely in making home loans since loans that do not conform are
not eligible to be purchased by the agencies for resale to
investors. About two-thirds of all residential mortgages end up
being resold into the secondary market.
   David James Croft, Freddie Mac's executive vice president for
operations, said that the task force had been useful in resolving
several differences in underwriting guidelines between the two
corporations.
   ``With Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae having the same basic
policies, lenders will not have to separate loans during
origination based on which agency they plan to sell the mortgages
to. That will streamline operations for mortgage lenders, resulting
in better rates for borrowers,'' Croft said.
   Under the guidelines, the two agencies reached agreement on 20
different underwriting differences including loan-to-value ratios,
multiple mortgages to the same borrower, seller contributions, age
of credit documents and how to classify investment properties.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz accused
Iraq on Thursday of ``unjustifiable and abhorrent'' use of chemical
weapons against its minority Kurdish population.
   In a 50-minute meeting with a senior Iraqi diplomat, Sadoon
Hamadi, Shultz threatened to reverse the recent improvement in U.S.
relations with the Middle Eastern country if human rights abuses
continuesd.
   ``The secretary asked that the Iraqi government weight this
factor fully in its decision-making,'' said State Department
spokesman Charles E. Redman.
   On Capitol Hill, meantime, Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill to slap
economic sanctions on Iraq.
   Redman, in a statement issued after the meeting, said Shultz
``conveyed to Iraqi Minister of State Hamadi our view that Iraq's
use of chemical weapons in its military campaign against Iraqi
Kurds is unjustifiable and abhorrent.''
   A U.S. official said Shultz also used the word ``horrifying''to
describe the situation.
   With chants of pro-Kurdish demonstrators ringing in his ears,
Hamadi denied the charges in a brief news conference outside the
department building.
   ``This is absolutely baseless and this has not taken place at
all,'' he said.
   Hamadi denounced the Democratic Party Union, a Kurdish group
headed by Jalal Talabani, as terrorists who collaborated with Iran
in the eight-year Persian Gulf war. He said Kurdish refugees who
have taken sanctuary in Turkey were free to return home.
   Shultz's session with Hamadi initially was scheduled to survey
efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war. A U.S. official said Shultz
listened without comment to a report by Hamadi on sputtering
negotiations being held under United Nations auspices.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, said there was no
indication the U.S. dispute was Iraq over chemical weapons was
having a spillover effect on the negotiations.
   Shultz told Hamadi that the United States would explore with
friendly governments ways to influence Iraq to cease chemical
warfare practices ``which are unacceptable to the civilized world.''
   State Department officials declined to say what those measures
might be.
   The bill introduced by Pell, D-R.I., would cut off economic
credits to Iraq, require the United States to vote against loans to
Iraq in international financial institutions and prohibit
importation of Iraqi oil.
   Pell, in a statement, said the sanctions would remaion in place
``as long as Iraq uses poisonous gas in violation of the 1925
Geneva Protocols and as long as Iraq's campaign of genocide against
the Kurdish people continues.''
   Spokesman Redman refused to say how the United States obtained
its incriminating evidence against Iraq. However, he said a U.S.
embassy official in Turkey had traveled through areas in which
Kurdish refugees gained sanctuary.
   Earlier this week, the State Department said it had no evidence
to substantiate widespread reports that Iraq employed cyanide and
other chemical weapons against entire Kurdish villages.
   Thousands of Kurds fled to Turkey, which in the past has had
strains with its own Kurdish population. But Redman said Turkey had
been very hospitable to the refugees, creating new villages to
house them.
   ``The United States is convinced that Iraq has used chemical
weapons in its military campaign against Kurdish guerrillas,'' he
said. ``We don't know the extent to which chemical weapons have
been used, but any use in this context is abhorrent and
unjustifiable.''
   The spokesman added: ``We have expressed our strong concern to
the Iraqi government, which is well aware of our position that use
of chemical weapons is totally unjustifiable and unacceptable. The
secretary will be raising this issue with the Iraqi minister of
state.''
   In the past, the State Department also accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons against Iranian troops in the eight-year Persian
Gulf war.
   Iraq has consistently denied the charges.
   The session with Hamadi was scheduled before reports circulated
last weekend that Iraqi troops had slain hundreds of Kurdish
survivors of gas attacks.
   On Tuesday, the ruling Revolutionary Command Council in Baghdad
announced a ``general and comprehensive'' amnesty for Kurdish
rebels in an apparent effort to counter the poison gas allegations.
   A spokesman for the Iraqi embassy here denied the reports, which
he said were being spread by Kurdish leaders in Euorpe, far from
the claimed disaster scene.
   He said the Iraqi army was taking up positions that had been
occupied ``by people who collaborated with the enemy in the past.''
   The spokesman, Abul Rahman Jamal, said some of them may have
been Kurds or Arabs. ``They collaborated with the Iranians and
facilitated their movement into the country,'' he said.
   Jamal also said Western newspapers had ``blown up'' reports
circulated by a handful of Kurdish leaders who were touring Europe,
``trying to air accusations'' against Iraq.
   The Kurds, a non-Arab people, are a stateless minority in Iraq,
Iran, Turkey and other countries in the area.
   On Wednesday, referring to the Kurds' quest for autonomy, Redman
appeared to rule out U.S. support for statehood.
   ``Our policy is that the Kurds should satisfy their aspirations
peacefully within the framework of the existing states of the area
and that it is a matter that has to be worked out between the Kurds
and the respective governments,'' he said.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Measure Aims to Protect Elderly and Infirm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two House members on Thursday introduced a
far-reaching civil rights proposal to protect elderly and infirm
Americans from widespread abuse and neglect recently uncovered in
the nation's guardianship system.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., a chief sponsor of the National
Guardianship Rights Act, called the current system ``a national
disgrace.''
   ``Unfortunately, many state and local guardianship systems have
become sleeping watchdogs of personal liberty,'' Pepper said in a
statement. ``Even a convicted felon is guaranteed more rights in
many areas than innocent elderly and disabled Americans who are
subjects of guardianship proceedings.''
   The bill, introduced on Pepper's 88th birthday, would safeguard
the more than 500,000 Americans under guardianship and those facing
the prospect. The elderly would have more rights and recourse under
the bill, while guardians would have to meet new training and
reporting requirements.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., ranking Republican on the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, plans to introduce a similar guardianship
safeguards bill early next week, a committee spokeswoman said.
   People become wards of guardians if they are deemed incompetent
to handle their own affairs. The guardian assumes their legal
rights, possessions and decision-making authority; the ward
typically is not permitted to vote, own property, marry or make
medical decisions.
   Pepper said strong national safeguards against ``unnecessary and
unduly restrictive guardianships'' are necessary because the system
is so onerous. Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., Pepper's chief co-sponsor,
said the bill aims to ``restore guardianship to a system which does
indeed serve to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens.''
   Specifically, the bill would require that anyone facing
imposition of a guardianship receive adequate notice of impending
proceedings, be represented by trained attorneys, be afforded an
examination by an independent professional team, have the right to
a jury trial, and have the right to prompt appeal of the decision
or the choice of guardian.
   In addition the meaure would require that all guardians be of
competent character, receive thorough training, provide at least
annual reports on the financial and physical well-being of the
incapacitated person, and be subject to annual review and automatic
removal by the courts.
   The attorney general would enforce the legislation and could
withhold federal money from states not in compliance with the act.
   The Pepper-Bonker bill was spurred in part by an Associated
Press series that documented widespread abuses under the system,
ranging from theft and fraud to neglect and simple incompetence.
The AP series and its study of more than 2,000 cases were
repeatedly cited in an explanatory document released by the health
subcommittee chaired by Pepper.
   Among the AP findings:
   _97 percent of guardianship petitions are approved, indicating
the deck is stacked against the ``accused.''
   _Nearly half the files on guardians were missing at least one
annual accounting of money; only 16 percent of the files reviewed
contained reports on the elderly ward's well-being.
   _44 states require guardians to file regular accountings of a
ward's money, but they were missing or incomplete in 48 percent of
guardianship files examined. The opening of guardianship was the
last entry in 13 percent of the cases examined.

<HEAD>Rock Star's Art Auction Tops $7 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sale of rock star Elton John's diverse
collection of art objects, furniture, stage clothes and memorabilia
topped $7 million at a Sotheby's auction Thursday.
   John's stuffed toys, fantasy objects and designer clothing
fetched $144,000 and his art collection sold for $1.3 million.
   The running total in the four-day sale reached $7.6 million, the
auction house said.
   Among items sold Thursday night was a replica of the state
throne of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, its wood frame covered in
gold leaf and enameled on the backrest with Egyptian hieroglyphics,
which fetched $15,800.
   More of John's furniture, ceramics, sculpture and miscellaneous
items, including amusement machines and walking sticks, were to be
auctioned Friday, the final sale day.
   The entertainer's stage costumes, memorabilia, furniture,
ornaments and jewelry were sold Tuesday and Wednesday.
   John, 41, has said he wants to make room in his mansion near
Windsor, west of London, to start new collections.
   Prices for about 300 lots of art, from Rembrandt etchings to art
nouveau posters and fashion designs, mostly went well above the
presale estimates, Sotheby's auction house said.
   The top price was $119,000 for a painting of a fish wearing a
rope of pearls by the Belgian surrealist, Rene Magritte. It was
bought by an anonymous customer from Brussels.
   Two pictures by northern England artist L. S. Lowry, who mostly
painted industrial scenes, sold for a total of nearly $150,000, or
$64,200 above estimate.
   A modern sculpture of a kneeling woman supporting a glass-top
table, by British artist Allen Jones, made $35,300.
   A 1934 costume design for a Paris theater by Erte, pseudonym of
Romain de Tirtoff, sold to a private collector for $27,000, a
record for the artist's work.
   Fantasy paintings by the living German artist Paul Wunderlich
also did well, one called ``Olympia with Leaf,'' based on Edouard
Manet's famous nude courtesan, ``Olympia,'' sold for $26,000.

   Legislation imposing sanctions against Iraq
for its purported use of poison gas against Kurdish inhabitants was
introduced on Thursday by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who told the
Senate ``A crime of unthinkable proportions is emerging.''
   ``For the second time in this century a brutal dictatorship is
using deadly gas to exterminate a distinct ethnic minority,'' said
Pell, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``There can be no doubt but that the Iraqi regime of Saddam
Hussein intends this campaign to be a final solution to the Kurdish
problem,'' Pell said. ``While a people are gassed, the world is
largely silent.''
   The Iraqi embassy in Washington has denied that poison gas was
used against the Kurds, asserting that such charges have been
spread by Kurdish leaders living in Europe.
   The Pell resolution declares that the Iraqi actions against the
Kurds ``appears to constitute an act of genocide, a crime abhorred
by civilized people everywhere and banned under international law.''
   The resolution would ban all U.S. aid to Iraq, ban sales of U.S.
military equipment and ban the provision of credit or credit
guarantees. It would prohibit the transfer of sensitive technology
to Iraq and bar the import of Iraqi petroleum products into the
United States.
   It also would instruct the U.S. representative to the United
Nations to vote against all loans to Iraq.
   Pell noted that the Iraqi army moved against the Kurds after the
Aug. 20 ceasefire in Iraq's war with Iran with the objective of
ending Kurdish control over a large section of northeast Iraq.
   ``The offensive was accompanied by the dynamiting of Kurdish
villages throughout the region,'' Pell said. ``Poisonous gas was
used on the people.''
   ``It is said we do not have much influence over Iraq,'' Pell
said. ``This may be true, but I believe we must use whatever means
at our disposal to get their attention.
   ``The Iraqi regime is a vicious dictatorship toughened by years
of conflict,'' he said. ``Hand wringing alone will not change their
course; immediate action is essential.''

<HEAD>South African-Angolan Talks To Continue Until Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African, Angolan and Cuban
officials met with a U.S. mediator for a second day Thursday to
negotiate a timetable for withdrawing Cuban troops from Angola.
   South African officials said Cuban officials assured them they
were not reinforcing their garrisons in Angola.
   Foreign Minister Roelof Botha, speaking in South Africa, said
his delegation quoted the Cubans as saying recent Cuban troop
arrivals in Angola were replacements for troops about to be sent
home. Botha said he asked for greater clarification on this issue.
   Neil Van Heerden, South African director-general for foreign
affairs, told reporters in Brazzaville the talks will continue
until Friday.
   The U.S. State Department estimates 50,000 Cuban troops are in
Angola, supporting the Marxist government against anti-Marxist
guerrillas and South African military incursions.
   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi and U.S. sources have claimed
Cuba was sending an additional 10,000 troops to Angola. South
Africa said this violate a month-old cease-fire between South
Africa and Angolan-Cuban forces.
   A timetable for Cuban withdrawal has been the main obstacle to
an agreement, which would also facilitiate independence for the
South African-ruled territory of South-West Africa, or Namibia.
South Africa has linked Namibian independence to Cuban troop
withdrawal from Namibia's northern neighbor, Angola.
   A senior Angolan diplomat meanwhile was quoted as saying
Thursday that Savimbi's UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ plans to move its headquarters from Jamba
in southeastern Angola to northern Quimbele, near Angola's border
with Zaire.
   A report from the Angolan news agency ANGOP, monitored in
Lisbon, Portugal, quoted Andre Neto, an Angolan diplomat in Lusaka,
Zambia, as saying the move was to facilitate the continuation of
U.S. military aid to UNITA from what he claimed was a U.S. military
base at Kamina in Zaire.
   Zaire and the United States deny allegations that Zaire allows
America to supply UNITA rebels with arms by way of a disused air
base in Zaire.
   In a separate report Thursday, ANGOP said the first of 11
planned frontier control posts, manned by Angolan and South African
forces to monitor a cease-fire agreement, was officially opened
Tuesday.
   Savimbi does not recognize the cease-fire, as UNITA is not party
to the U.S.-sponsored talks. UNITA statements, released in Lisbon
Thursday, claimed the rebels killed 61 Angolan soldiers and shot
down an MI-17 helicopter, killing all those on board, in six
separate clashes.
   Rebel casualties were given as seven dead and 16 wounded.

   Government spokesmen insist President
Alfredo Stroessner enjoys good health, but his absences from
official functions has provoked rumors that he is recovering from
surgery.
   ``I'm no doctor, but his health is very good,'' Mario Abdo
Benitez told a radio station Wednesday night when asked about
Stroessner's physical condition. He is the 75-year-old general's
private secretary and vice president of the ruling Colorado Party.
   Juan Jose Benitez Rickmann, the presidential press secretary,
was asked to comment on rumors that Stroessner had prostrate
surgery Aug. 31 at an Asuncion hospital. He replied that it was
only a checkup for a scheduled visit to Taiwan in October.
   Officials at the state-run Institute of Social Security Hospital
refused comment. Activity at the hospital was normal Thursday and
security precautions that usually signal the leader's presence were
not in evidence.
   Stroessner, who has ruled since a coup in 1954, was
conspicuously absent Wednesday at the commemoration of the death on
Sept. 7, 1940 of army Marshal Jose Felix Estigarribia. The marshal
led victorious Paraguayan forces in the 1930s Chaco War against
Bolivia and served briefly as president.
   The usual accounts of Stroessner's daily official activities
have been absent from newspapers and official radio broadcasts
since late last week. Stroessner normally arrives at his office
early and spends the day receiving delegations and attending to
state business.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine for dangerous childhood diseases that
include a form of meningitis has had mixed results, according to
three studies in a prominent medical journal.
   But an accompanying editorial in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association says the results should not stop
doctors from giving patients a new version of the vaccine.
   ``Like it or not, we must often make decisions in the absence of
incontrovertible evidence,'' Dr. Edward A. Mortimer Jr., of Case
Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, wrote
in the editorial.
   The original vaccine, for fighting a bacterium called
Haemophilus influenzae type B, was first licensed for use in the
United States in April 1985, largely because a clinical trial in
Finland had found it was 90 percent effective in preventing disease
in children 18 to 71 months old and older.
   An updated version of the vaccine, approved in December by the
Food and Drug Administration, is designed to improve protection for
younger children.
   A committee of the Centers for Disease Control has recommended
its use for all children at 18 months, officials said.
   The studies published in Friday's journal reviewed use of the
original vaccine, which could be considered obsolete except for its
cheaper cost, said Dr. Eugene Shapiro of the Yale University School
of Medicine, leader of one of the studies.
   Shapiro said the first vaccine hasn't been shown to cause harm,
so could still be used.
   The bacterium infects about 20,000 U.S. children each year and
in about 12,000 of those cases takes the form of bacterial
meningitis, which can cause retardation, said Dr. Lee H. Harrison,
who led one of the CDC studies.
   Among other problems caused by the bacterium are infections of
the blood or of the epiglottis, which can cause suffocation, he
said.
   The bacterium is believed to be transmitted by person-to-person
contact, officials said.
   About 5 percent of cases of disease caused by the bacterium are
fatal, said Harrison.
   He said he knew of no states which require the vaccine, but that
it is administered to about 30 percent of the nation's children.
   When the original vaccine was approved for use in the United
States, information on its effectiveness was limited. Doubts were
raised by some doctors who questioned its ability to provide
protection.
   According to separate reports in the Chicago-based medical
journal, a study in all or part of six states found a 45 percent
effective rate of protection from immunization in 18- to
59-month-olds and another, conducted in parts of three states,
found it 88 percent effective in 2- to 6-year-olds.
   A third study, of children beginning at age 2 in Minnesota,
found that the vaccine may even increase risk of the disease by 55
percent.
   But authors of the Minnesota study noted they dealt with just 88
cases, and that chance alone could explain the instances of
bacterium-related disease.
   ``I have trouble puting a lot of weight on the Minnesota
study,'' said Harrison.
   Mortimer said the newer vaccine has been shown to create more
antibodies in younger children, so ``the probable benefits outweigh
the costs and risks, if any, (and) I recommend use of this (new)
vaccine for children beginning at 18 months of age, pending further
information.''

<HEAD>Spy Fails To Gain Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss woman imprisoned for
spying for the Soviet Union was rebuffed by a judge Thursday after
trying to gain freedom by renouncing violence.
   President P.W. Botha offered to release jailed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela if he renounces violence. Lawyers
for Ruth Gerhardt said the offer should apply to any security
prisoner, but Supreme Court Justice R.J. Goldstone disagreed.
   The judge said Botha's offer was not a binding obligation, but
rather a promise to consider the release of security prisoners who
renounced violence.
   Mrs. Gerhardt was convicted of treason Dec. 31, 1983 and is
serving a 10-year prison sentence.
   Her husband, Dieter Gerhardt, was sentenced to life imprisonment
at the same trial after both were convicted of being spies for the
KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency. He was commanding officer at

white-led government. The African National Congress is the main
guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the government.

<HEAD>Mrs. Aquino Says Lawlessness Is Government's Biggest Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said
Thursday that law and order has collapsed in the Philippines and
restoring it is her government's first priority.
   In a speech for the 22nd anniversary of the National Police
Commission, a watchdog body that monitors police abuses, she
declared:
   ``The demands I get are increasingly less for the good life, for
social justice and other important aspirations as for the basic
requirement that the state do to every man its basic duty: keep him
and his family secure from physical harm, his property rights
respected, and his community a safe and decent place to live and
work in.
   ``The tragedy in this country is that this very function is so
divided and confused that the state quite frequently fails to
perform it.''
   The president asked people to support a bill now in Congress
that would merge the Philippine Constabulary and local police into
one national police force. The constabulary is part of the military.
   Mrs. Aquino did not cite crime statistics or examples, but
killings and armed robberies are frequent and many crimes go
unsolved. Firearms are everywhere and newspapers often report
killings during petty arguments or drunken brawls.
   Last month, Mrs. Aquino denounced the involvement of soldiers
and police in such crimes such as murder, car thefts, prostitution,
gambling and extortion of money from businesses and motorists.
   ``The first duty of the state is law and order,'' she said
Thursday. ``This priority ranks higher than social amelioration,
human development, cultural attainment and whatever else one can
think of. This may sound unduly harsh, but only the ignorant will
deny it.''
   She said law and order are so basic that ``hardly anyone thinks
of them until they are lost or gravely threatened.
   ``The only time the state remembers its minimal function _ the
protection of life and property _ is when their violation reaches
such proportions that the public puts on the pressure. The pressure
is on us.''

   Half of the 1,000 people forced from
their homes by waist-deep water headed home Thursday as floodwaters
subsided, leaving roads passable and letting businesses and schools
reopen.
   Scattered showers continued Thursday, but Manatee County was
spared the torrential downpours of the previous three days that
turned streets into rivers. All but one school reopened Thursday.
   Damage in the rain-soaked Bradenton-Palmetto area of Tampa Bay
was estimated at more than $1 million. The area has been drenched
by more than 14 inches of rain this week.
   Gov. Bob Martinez planned to view the area by helicopter on
Friday.
   ``The heavy rains and flooding have caused a severe dispruption
in the lives of Manatee County residents and I want to see
firsthand whether condiions might require additional assistance
from the state,'' he said.
   The flooding was blamed on a near-stationary cold front hovering
across the central Florida peninsula. The National Weather Service
said the front Thursday was drifting north to the Tampa-St.
Petersburg area, where the Red Cross opened two shelters for
possible evacuees from low-lying areas.
   The steady rains were expected to fade to occasional showers and
thunderstorms overnight.
   Floodwaters Wednesday swept away a motorist and drowned a
toddler, authorities said. James Edward Mercer, 45, was pulled
under by a strong current in a drainage ditch and presumed drowned.
He disappeared after a car stalled in the ditch and began to float.
   In New Port Richey, 2-year-old Matthew Rehm wandered behind his
home and drowned in a rain-swelled canal, authorities said.
   On Thursday, teams of inspectors went out at daybreak in
high-riding vehicles and airboats to evaluate neighborhoods along
the Manatee River, which overflwed Wednesday and forced the
evacuations.
   Homeowners near the river were advised to stay away one more day.
   Floodwaters in some areas had not receded significantly by
Thursday, and emergency crews said some riverside homes had several
feet of water inside, said Tom Strickland of the county's Emergency
Management Services.
   ``The problem now will be shelter fever and people not feeling
well because of high stress, worrying about their homes and
belongings,'' said Marilyn Sapharas, shelter coordinator at Christ
Episcopal Church, where nearly 200 people were staying.
   At the church shelter Thursday morning, children passed the time
watching television. Adults sat around tables in the parish hall,
talking, after a breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausages and biscuits.
   The elderly and frail were given quieter quarters in the library
and choir rooms of the church center.
   ``I'm worried about when I finally do get home, what condition
my furniture will be in and what kind of mess I'll find,'' said
Anne Williams, a single parent with five children ages 8 to 17.
``We'll have to start all over again.''
   Although disappointed, shelter residents were glad to be in
dryer quarters.
   ``It's nice here, no complaints,'' said Larry Hunter, 31, who
spent all day Wednesday helping neighbors evacuate through
knee-deep water. ``When they let us go home I hope I don't find a
snake or an alligator looking out at me,'' he said.
   Residents returning home were urged by county public health
officers to disinfect sinks and showers, discard any food touched
by flood waters and to check wells for broken pipes or flooding.

   Thousands of radical students Thursday
protested the Olympics and demanded that the government release
political prisoners and charge a former president with corruption,
reports and witnesses said.
   In communist North Korea, leader Kim Il Sung called for
increased economic and technological ties with capitalist
countries. He also said in a speech on the eve of North Korea's
40th anniversary that he would welcome a delegation from archrival
South Korea to discuss reunification.
   The demonstrations in Seoul and provincial cities attracted
about 3,500 students from a dozen colleges, the South Korean news
agency Yonhap said.
   The most violent protests were reported in the southern city of
Kwangju, where 600 students, throwing rocks and firebombs, fought
riot police after an anti-Olympic rally at Chonam University,
Yonhap said.
   Police fired tear gas as students tried to march off the school
grounds, Yonhap said. No arrests or injuries were reported.
   The students in Kwangju accused the government of President Roh
Tae-woo of trying to use the Olympic Games, to be held Sept.
17-Oct. 2, to suppress democratic movements, campus sources said.
   In Seoul, about 500 radical students and dissidents rallied
peacefully at Korea University, urging the government to release
all political prisoners before the Olympics.
   Dissident leaders contended at the Seoul rally that the value of
the Olympics would diminish if dissidents remained in prison.
   The protesters, including about 50 people describing themselves
as ``elderly democrats,'' dispersed voluntarily after a brief
sit-down in front of the school's main gate. Police stayed away and
did not intervene.
   Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses,
have demanded that the Olympics in Seoul be shared with North Korea
to help reunite the divided Korean peninsula. They have little
public support.
   In an interview Thursday, opposition leader Kim Young-sam said
that he believed the Olympics would unite the South Korean people.
   Kim said Koreans wanted the Olympics to be a major success and
that he was confident there would be no attempt to disrupt the
Games.
   North Korea has said it will stay away from the Seoul Olympics,
because its demand to co-host the Games was not accepted. The
International Olympic Committee rejected the North's co-hosting
demand, saying the Olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot
be shared.
   ``We deplore a half Olympics,'' Yonhap quoted protesters as
chanting.
   The students argued that the Olympics would only help perpetuate
the division of the peninsula, divided at the end of World War II,
the agency said.
   Yonhap said students also demanded the arrest of former
President Chun Doo-hwan for alleged involvement in corruption.
   At Kyunghee University's Suwon campus in Suwon, 45 miles south
of Seoul, 200 students burned an effigy of Chun and clashed with
riot police, it said.
   Police fired tear gas to stop the students from hurling rocks
and firebombs, the agency said. No arrests or injuries were
reported in the one-hour clash.
   Chun, who stepped down at the end of his seven-year term in
February, has come under public fire for alleged involvement in
financial and other scandals.
   Radical students and dissidents charge that the government is
blocking legal proceedings to bring Chun to justice.
   In his speech, broadcast by North Korea's state-run Radio
Pyongyang, Kim Il Sung said developing ties with friendly
capitalist countries is important in bringing his nation's economy
more in line with those of advanced countries.
   ``We should develop good neighborly and friendly relations with
capitalist countries which esteem our nation's right of
independence,'' he said in the broadcast, monitored in Tokyo.
   North Korea's sluggish economy is plagued with mismanagement,
heavy international debt and an enormous portion of the country's
gross national product, some 20 percent, spent on the military.
   The broadcast quoted Kim, 76, as saying during an 80-minute
speech at a rally that a North-South summit should discuss creation
of a unified confederate government reuniting the peninsula, which
was divided at the end of the three-year Korean War in 1953.
   Reunification talks last month resulted in no agreement.

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops fired Thursday
on a mob of attacking Palestinians, killing one man. Palestinians
staged a general strike in the occupied lands to mark nine months
of rebellion against Israeli rule.
   Eleven Palestinians, including two 9-year-old girls, were shot
and wounded in clashes with troops in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Arab doctors said.
   Israel radio quoted Arab sources as saying a 2-week-old boy,
Nihad Jaradat, died of tear gas inhalation after troops fired tear
gas in and around homes in the West Bank's Siir village near Hebron.
   The military command said that there has been no army activity
in Siir and that the fatality has not been reported to any Israeli
authority. Officials at Hebron's Alia hospital said they were not
aware of the case.
   In Nablus, 14 Arabs pleaded innocent to charges they took part
in a stone-throwing protest in April that resulted in the death of
a Jewish girl who was shot accidentally by a Jewish guard.
   Also Thursday, the army said two soldiers and an officer will be
tried in connection with the beating of a 17-year-old Gaza City
boy, Fuad Tarazi, who died Feb. 9.
   U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, meanwhile,
said on Israel Television Thursday that Washington's invitation to
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to attend a high-level
Mideast meeting came too late.
   Dukakis said in an interview that encouraging peace efforts,
``has to be something the administration begins early in its tenure
and works hard to achieve. That didn't happen with this
administration and I think this is going to be a new administration
that is going to do that.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir criticized the Reagan
administration for scheduling the meeting for for Sept. 26, five
weeks before Israel's Nov. 1 election.
   Leaders of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc accused Peres, head of
the left-of-center Labor Party, of engineering the invitation to
boost Labor's chances in the election.
   Shamir said on Israel army radio the invitation was not a U.S.
intervention in Israeli elections, but appeared to ``belong to the
(Nov. 8) U.S. elections, and we were accidentally caught in it.''
He did not elaborate.
   On Israel radio, Peres denied he arranged the invitation and
said both he and Shamir were told last month U.S. diplomats were
trying to work out such a meeting.
   Thursday's general strike was called by pro-PLO uprising leaders
to mark the nine months of the ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, begun
Dec. 8.
   Compliance was viewed as a key test of their control because of
the growing rift between the Palestine Liberation Organization and
the Moslem fundamentalist ``Hamas'' group, which called a rival
strike for Friday.
   The general strike was observed throughout the occupied lands,
but in Gaza City, graffiti scrawled on walls in red called on
residents to comply with the Hamas strike call for Friday.
   In the West Bank, Israeli troops fatally shot 36-year-old
Mohammed Abu Salah in the head and seriously wounded another man in
the abdomen in clashes in Silat Harathiya, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the casualties and said soldiers fired when
attacked by masked youths wielding clubs and knives.
   Palestinian witnesses said the violence erupted when youths
trying to stop Arab workers from going to their jobs in Israel
turned on the soldiers and began pelting them with stones.
   In Nablus, a 13-year-old youth was shot in the arm and a
19-year-old Arab was shot in the stomach, hospital officials said.
The army confirmed the casualties and said one of the wounded
hurled a firebomb at troops.
   Several violent clashes erupted in the Gaza Strip, and eight
Palestinians, including four teen-agers and two 9-year-old girls,
were wounded by troops, hospital officials said. The army said it
was checking this report.
   In Gaza City, riot police burst into Shifa Hospital and briefly
held two children suspected of attacking troops with bottles and
stones, the army said.
   The death of Abu Salah brought to 260 the number of Palestinians
killed since the uprising began.
   Five Israelis have also died, including 15-year-old Tirza Porat,
who was killed April 6 during a clash between Jewish settler
teen-agers and Palestinians in the West Bank village of Beita.
   The trial against 20 Beita residents opened in Nablus on
Thursday, and 14 pleaded innocent to charges of participating in
the clash. The other six will enter pleas later.
   If convicted, they could face sentences of up to 20 years in
jail, lawyers said.
   Miss Porat was killed when Jewish settlers she was hiking with
clashed with Palestinians in Beita.
   Many Israelis expressed outrage at the slaying, but the army
later found Miss Porat was shot accidentally by a Jewish guard
during the clash.

<HEAD>Officials Seize 183 Pounds Of Heroin Found In Bean Sprout Machine</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ALAN COOPERMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the bean sprout washing machine was shipped
from Hong Kong, police were waiting. When they opened its hollow
steel rollers, they found 183 pounds of nearly pure heroin worth up
to $260 million on the street.
   On Thursday, after six men were arrested in the case, state and
federal law enforcement officials said the heroin seizure was one
of the largest in U.S. history.
   ``This is a very rare event to see this much heroin concentrated
in one location,'' said John J. Coleman, special agent in charge of
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in New England.
   He said the heroin was probably enough to supply all the addicts
in New England for more than a year.
   State police and U.S. Customs officers, acting on confidential
information, were watching for the machine when it arrived by truck
at a Boston warehouse Aug. 30. According to court documents, they
replaced most of the heroin with sand and waited for someone to
claim the device.
   The heroin was hidden in the airtight, stainless steel rollers
of the machine, said Coleman.
   Four men were arrested Tuesday after they allegedly picked up
the machine in a rental truck, distributed parts of it to two
locations in Boston and then took the remainder to a scrap metal
dealer.
   Undercover DEA agents later delivered some of the heroin to New
York City, where they arrested two more men Wednesday night.
   All six suspects have been charged with possession of heroin and
conspiracy to distribute the drug, said Frank L. McNamara Jr., U.S.
attorney for Massachusetts.
   McNamara said authorities believe the men are important figures
in the drug trade, not merely ``mules,'' or carriers of drugs, and
may have ties to Chinese organized crime groups.
   Police in Hong Kong have conducted several raids in recent days
in connection with the case, but no arrests have been made there,
he said.
   Five cardboard cartons of heroin were displayed at the news
conference, along with the disassembled parts of the bean sprout
machine, a contraption of prongs and rollers used by Oriental
restaurants and produce merchants.
   ``The concealment effort was outstanding,'' said Williams S.
Simmons, acting special agent in charge of the U.S. Customs Service
for the Northeast region.
   Regional Customs Director Philip W. Spayd said the amount of
heroin seized was one of the largest in the country and the largest
ever in New England. Approximately 200 pounds was discovered in a
shipment of ice buckets in Seattle in 1985, and 378 pounds was
found in Miami in 1971.
   Once diluted, the street value of the seized heroin would have
been between $200 million and $260 million, he said.
   Police said the four men arrested in Boston were of Vietnamese
origin and gave their names as Hung Ta, 24; Dang Phu, 23; Hieu Ly,
24; and Tuong Luu, 45. They were in the custody pending arraignment
Friday.
   The two men arrested in New York were identified as Wai Kwok
Wong, 40, and Sik-Sze Yan, 36. McNamara said they are of Chinese
origin. They appeared Thursday before a federal magistrate in U.S.
District Court but did not enter pleas and were held without bail
pending a detention hearing Sept. 14.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from the Post Office and the
Communication Workers Union met Thursday in an attempt to end
Britain's week-old mail strike.
   International mail service remained at a standstill. But about
half of Britain's 1,500 local post offices opened with non-striking
and temporary staff who made sporadic deliveries, said Post Office
spokeswoman Caroline Francke.
   The walkout began Aug. 31 as a 24-hour strike called in a
dispute over bonuses paid to new recruits in London and southeast
England, where the cost of living is high and the Post Office has
trouble attracting workers because of low unemployment.
   The strike now has no time limit, with the union demanding that
the bonuses be paid nationally or not at all.
   ``Until there is a concrete framework agreed on over the central
recruitment issue and a formula over getting postmen back to work
quickly these exploratory talks will go on,'' said Ms. Francke.
   Union President Alan Tuffin said Thursday, ``We are no nearer
reaching an agreement.''
   A spokesman would not confirm whether Tuffin joined the talks.
   About 100,000 of the union's 140,000 members stayed off the job
Thursday, said Ms. Francke, and only one of Britain's 82 main
postal sorting centers, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, opened for
business.
   More than 100 million pieces of mail have piled up since the
strike began, said Ms. Francke. Mail boxes around the country have
been sealed.
   Liverpool police said strikers in that city, 200 miles northwest
of London, behaved peacefully Thursday but picket line violence
during the week led to the arrest of five strikers for disorderly
conduct.
   The strike has disrupted business and the work of government
agencies.
   A watchdog body, the Mail Users' Association, said Wednesday the
dispute is costing British industry $43 million a day.

   The only rain in the nation Thursday was in the south Atlantic
Coast states and Florida, and Tropical Storm Florence stalled far
out in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Florence was about 500 miles south of New Orleans on Thursday
afternoon, with winds up to 55 mph. Florence has moved only
slightly north since its inception Wednesday.
   As long as Florence continues in the Gulf, seas and swells will
build throughout the Gulf of Mexico.
   Rains in the south Atlantic coastal states and Florida were
gradually spreading to the north and west as southeast winds pushed
a warm front back to the northwest.
   Breezy conditions continued across the north-central part of the
nation. Winds gusted to 45 mph across parts of North Dakota.
   A cold front extended across the upper Mississippi Valley and
the central Great Plains. The front has produced few clouds or rain
due to the lack of moisture.
   Thursday afternoon temperatures were mostly in the 70s over the
Atlantic coastal states, the Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio
valley.
   Readings were in the 80s across the middle and lower Mississippi
Valley and the central Plains, with some lower 90s in Texas.
Temperatures were also in the 80s to lower 90s across the southern
Plateau region. Temperatures were also in the 80s to lower 90s in
southern Florida. Readings in the desert Southwest were in the 90s
to near 100 degrees.
   To the north, temperatures were in the 60s and 70s from the
upper Mississippi Valley across the northern Great Plains, the
northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Readings in the desert
Southwest were in the 90s to near 100 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 102 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The low in the nation Thursday was 23 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo., and about 20 cities set low temperature records.
   Friday's forecast was for showers and thunderstorms across the
middle and southern Atlantic coastal states, the southern
Appalachians and the central Gulf Coast. Showers and thunderstorms
were to be most numerous over Georgia, Alabama and northwest
Florida. Widely scattered showers were predicted for western New
York and eastern Michigan.
   High temperatures were to be in the 70s and 80s across most of
the nation. Readings were expected to climb to the 90s over the
southern Great Plains, New Mexico, the central and southern Plateau
and southwest Oregon. Highs were to be in the 90s to near 105
degrees over the desert Southwest and interior valleys of
California.

<TEXT>
   A 63-year-old Jewish ``refusenik'' dying of
cancer has again been denied permission to leave the Soviet Union
for urgently needed medical treatment, a Soviet Jewry group said
Thursday.
   The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews said it had learned that
Soviet authorities have refused to grant an exit visa for Georgi
Samoilovich, a Moscow mathematician suffering from a deadly throat
lymphoma.
   Last month, Samoilovich was removed from a waiting list to enter
the Blokhin Cancer Institute in Moscow for treatment.
   Samoilovich has been seeking permission to emigrate to Israel
for 11 years. His wife, a physician, also is a refusenik.
   Americans who have been urging the Soviet government to let
Samoilovich emigrate include Dr. Richard Rosenbluth, chief
oncologist at Hackensack Medical Center in Hackensack, N.J.
   ``We will be starting a last, desperate, all-out campaign to
save his life, and I hope the world will be with us,'' Rosenbluth
said.
   Soviet authorities have been denying Samoilovich permission to
emigrate on grounds that he once did classified research work. But
Rosenbluth noted that Samoilovich ``has not worked in his
profession in over 10 years.''
   ``The injustice of this case is overwhelming, especially in
light of the new humanitarian facade the Soviets are putting on,''
Rosenbluth said.

<HEAD>Deposits Flow Out For Third Consecutive Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposits flowed out of the nation's savings
institutions for the third consecutive month in July, the
government said Thursday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said net withdrawals from the
3,088 savings institutions were $123 million in July after hitting
a revised $3.3 billion in June, up from a previous estimate of $2.9
billion.
   In May, S&L customers withdrew $1.1 billion. But, before that
deposits grew for seven consecutive months as investors battered by
the October stock market crash sought a safe haven for their money
in government-insured accounts.
   Bank Board economist James Barth said in a statement that a
slowdown in withdrawals is normal for July. Consumers typically
take money from their accounts at the start of summer to pay for
vacations and other seasonal expenses.
   Mortgage lending by thrift institutions in July declined to
$21.1 billion, 14 percent below the same month last year when many
people were refinancing their mortgages, the bank board said.
   Barth said the drop in mortgage lending reflects the climb in
interest rates this summer.
   The bank board also reported that the institutions' capital
declined by $573 million in July after falling by $3.0 billion in
June. For the first seven months of the year, it's off $6.4 billion.
   Declines in capital, which is the difference between an
institution's loans and other assets and what it owes to depositors
and other creditors, often reflect losses.

<HEAD>Growth In Spending By PACS Slows As Races Are Less Competitive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending by political action committees to
influence the 1988 elections is on the increase, but the rise is
far smaller than in previous years, the Federal Election Commission
said Thursday.
   Several political scientists said the money figures compiled by
the FEC indicate that the PAC movement may be leveling off and
reaching its saturation point.
   The FEC said that for the 18 months ending June 30, PACs
representing business, labor, ideological and other interest groups
spent $215.4 million, a 4.8 percent increase over the same period
in the 1985-6 election cycle.
   The increase, however, was well below the 38 percent rise in PAC
spending that occurred in the corresponding 18 months of the 1985-6
cycle when compared to the 1983-4 cycle, which itself was up 44
percent over 1981-2.
   Receipts by PACs showed a similar slowing in growth. The $266.6
million collected during the first 18 months of the current cycle
was 4.7 percent above 1985-6, which saw 18-month receipts running
30 percent above 1983-4, which was 42 percent over 1981-2.
   As of June 30, PACs had given $94.9 million to candidates for
federal office: $3 million to presidential races, $32.7 million to
Senate candidates and $59.2 million to House candidates.
   This represented a 21 percent increase over the same 18 months
in 1985-6. This rate, however, was below the 38 percent rise from
1983-4 to 1985-6 and the 49 percent growth from 1981-2 to 1983-4.
   Incumbent senators and representatives got got nearly 90 percent
of the money contributed by PACs to congressional races in the
first 18 months of this election cycle. Democrats led Republicans
$60.9 million to $33.9 million.
   Norman Ornstein, a congressional analyst with the American
Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, said the
double-digit percentage increases in PAC receipts and spending
couldn't continue indefinitely.
   ``We may have reached a saturation point,'' he said. ``That's
good news for all of us except campaign vendors.''
   Ornstein said that ``it's hard to say whether we've got a
long-term trend.''
   He said the reduced rates of increase could be partly
attributable to ``to so few competitive races in the House. There
isn't the demand from incumbents to put the screws to PACs.''
   Janet Grenzke, a political science professor at Holy Cross
College in Worcester, Mass., said the figures could indicate ``the
saturation point is nearing'' for PACs.
   ``Those people who were going to form PACs and who were going to
participate in the political process through them have pretty much
done so,'' Grenzke said.
   She said some political money that previously might have been
channeled through PACs now could be ending up as ``soft money,''
the less-controlled and little-reported cash flow increasingly
finding its way to places like political party committees.
   Herb Alexander, a political science professor at the University
of Southern California, said the number of PACs has leveled off, as
has the number of PACs that are really active.
   ``A couple of hundred PACs do half the business,'' he said.
``There's an ingrown limitation on how much they can raise. ...
While it's not at a standstill, the growth rate isn't as explosive.
...
   ``The PAC phenomenom is reaching a point of natural limits,''
said Alexander.
   Randy Huwa of Common Cause, the self-described citizens lobby
that has been urging Congress to outlaw PACs, said he was not
heartened by the latest FEC figures.
   ``The first thing I look at is contributions to candidates, and
that's continuing to grow,'' he said.

<HEAD>FTC Aid Dismissed After Dukakis Letter</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS two grafs with comment by Clews.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Trade Commission aide has been
dismissed after sending a letter to newspaper editorial boards
criticizing Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Carter Clews, associate director for media relations, was
dismissed on Wednesday, said FTC general counsel Robert Paul, who
said his office has been assigned to investigate the case.
   The letter was sent Aug. 4 by Clews to newspapers, offering to
rebut criticism of the agency by Dukakis and questioning statements
made by Dukakis in a controversy over advertising by optometrists.
   Paul said he was not prepared to say whether Clews' action
violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits political acitvity by
federal workers. He said the investigation is continuing.
   Meanwhile FTC commissioners Mary L. Azcuenaga and Andrew J.
Strenio issued a statement dissociating themselves from a second
latter sent by Clews to broadcast talk show hosts offering
appearances by commission members.
   That letter contains a postscript saying that Dukakis has been
critical of the commission and adds that commission members are
willing to discuss the records of the FTC and of the Massachusetts
governor.
   Azcuenaga, an independent, and Strenio, a Democrat, said they
are happy to make appearances to discuss consumer affairs and other
commission activities but will not discuss candidates for public
office.
   Clews said later Friday, ``I don't believe I violated the Hatch
Act, and the general counsel himself has not said I violated the
Hatch Act. And if I had violated the Hatch Act, there are certain
procedures that by law they have to go through to give me a fair
hearing. None of that was done.''
   ``I think this whole thing is political and I was targeted
because Commissioner Strenio and Commissioner Azcuenaga want to
prevent Mr. Dukakis from being criticized for his own attacks upon
the commission. All I did was try to set straight the record of the
Federal Trade Commission,'' he said.

   Five policemen and a girl were
slightly hurt when a bomb planted in a van parked outside a village
police station exploded Thursday, police said.
   The explosion, which caused extensive damage to the police
station building and nearby houses, happened at the County Tyrone
village of Coagh 25 miles west of Belfast.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters, who in
accordance with British practice declined to be identified, said a
warning was telephoned to police at Coagh shortly before the blast.
   Police were evacuating people from nearby houses when the bomb
went off. Police said the girl was believed to have been in a
telephone booth near the police station at the time of the
explosion. They did not have her age but said she was in her early
teens.
   One of the five injured policemen and the girl were taken to a
hospital at nearby Magherafelt. The other four injured policemen
did not require hospital treatment.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast but
suspicion inevitably fell on the Irish Republican Army.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the 95-percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   The presidential campaigns of George Bush and
Michael Dukakis have tentatively agreed on Sept. 25 for the first
debate between the two candidates, a Dukakis aide said Thursday.
   Both debates will be general in subject matter, in contrast to
four years ago when the first was on domestic policy and the second
covered defense and foreign policy, said Mark Goodin, Bush's
campaign spokesman.
   Paul Brountas, chairman of the Dukakis campaign, said the two
contenders will face each other in a televised debate at Wake
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Brountas said their second debate would be either Oct. 13 or 14,
depending on the length of the American League baseball playoff
series which will be televised in prime time.
   The debate between vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle and
Lloyd Bentsen is expected to take place during the week of Oct. 3.
   The two campaigns have not reached agreement on the location for
the second presidential debate and the vice presidential encounter,
he said.
   ``We are still discussing format, staging and the length of the
debates and we will continue to carry on those discussions,''
Brountas said after meeting with Bush's campaign chairman James A.
Baker III. ``We believe we made good progress. This will be an
opportunity for the American people to see presidential candidates
debating face-to-face and man-to-man.''
   The Dukakis campaign wanted at least one more debate, with the
first to be on foreign policy and national security issues, but
that was rejected by the Bush campaign.
   Brountas and Baker emphasized that nothing is finally settled
until they have agreed on all aspects of the debates.
   But Bush said Thursday night: ``It sounds very good. Got the
right number.''
   Additionally, a statement released on Air Force Two said, ``I
congratulate our negotiators on working out a formula for the
number and timing of debates which certainly has my support.''
   On Tuesday, after weeks of negotiations, the Dukakis campaign
said it was willing to accept the Bush campaign's offer of two
presidential debates as well as one encounter between Quayle and
Bentsen.
   The first debate will be sponsored by the National Commission on
Presidential Debates, a group headed by the chairmen of the
Republican and Democratic parties. The commission also was likely
to end up as sponsor of the vice presidential debate.
   The League of Women Voters will sponsor the second presidential
debate. League president Nancy Neuman said, ``The league is pleased
that it's now official that the American public will see at least
one non-partisan debate this fall.''
   She urged the campaigns to include the league in discussions on
format. Last spring, the league suggested 90-minute debates with a
single moderator rather than a panel of reporters such as used in
past presidential debates.
   Goodin said the site of the second presidential debate would
likely be on the West Coast.
   Meanwhile, NBC News president Michael Gartner issued a statement
saying the network would not be able to televise the first debate
live because it would conflict with its commitment to cover the
Olympic Games.
   ``NBC News will run a taped replay of the first presidential
debate between George Bush and Michael Dukakis that now has been
scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 25,'' Gartner said. ``NBC has long been
committed to broadcasting the Olympics, whose dates were known by
both political parties.''

   Earlier, Norway's national NTB news agency identified the
stricken facility as the 16,900-ton, Norwegian-owned drilling
vessel Viking Explorer and said it capsized and sank off the Borneo
island town of Balikpapan, with one Indonesian worker reported
missing.
   Both accounts said 100 workers were involved and NTB said all
but one man were rescued.
   NTB said three Norwegians were working on board during test
drilling. All the others were from the United States, Britain,
Canada, Singapore and Indonesia, it said.
   Total Indonesie is a major foreign oil firm operating under a
production-sharing contract with the state-owned Pertamina oil
company, the newspaper reported.

   Vice President George Bush, drawing on the
advantages of office to promote his presidential campaign, watched
the fiery destruction of two U.S. nuclear-missile rocket motors
Thursday and charged later that Democratic rival Michael Dukakis
wants ``to restrain us, not the Soviet Union'' in arms control.
   Bush, the Republican nominee for president, was the senior
government representative and featured speaker at Longhorn Army
Ammunition Plant in northeast Texas for a ceremony marking the
destruction of the first U.S. weapons under the U.S.-Soviet
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The event provided a highly telegenic campaign showcase and
dovetailed into Bush's themes of peace and prosperity.
   In a state where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs in a close
race, Bush also campaigned in Tyler and criticized Dukakis for
supporting a nuclear freeze as the INF missiles were being deployed
in Western Europe in response to a Soviet builduip.
   ``He wanted to restrain us, not the Soviet Union,'' Bush told an
enthusiastic Tyler crowd. ``Therein lies a big difference between
George Bush and the governor of Massachusetts.''
   In a setting designed for television cameras, Bush was joined on
stage by the Apache Belles, an all-female drill team from Tyler
Junior College, dressed in cowgirl hats and swimming suit-style
outfits decorated with fringe.
   ``I want to see us build on this record of peace through
strength and it can't be done if we have a naive view of the Soviet
Union,'' Bush said, attacking Dukakis anew for opposing the MX and
Midgetmen missiles, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-1
bomber and two aircraft carrier task forces.
   ``He asks for nothing in return,'' Bush said. ``We must not _
and if I am elected I will not _ make unilateral concessions to Mr.
Gorbachev or the Soviet Union.''
   Sheila Tate, press secretary to Bush, said the cost of Bush's
travel to the rocket-destruction in Karnack and related expenses
were being paid out of campaign funds, although Bush aides said it
was not a campaign event.
   In another development, she said the vice president _ in a
reversal of policy _ supports an increase in the minimum wage,
which has been fixed for seven years at $3.35 an hour. She did not
say how large a hike he favors.
   Bush, in an interview in Tyler, acknowledged that he goes out of
his way not to mention Dukakis' running mate, fellow Texan Lloyd
Bentsen.
   ``I keep crossing it out (from proposed speeches) when people
send it in there,'' Bush said. ``I'm running against the governor
of Massachusetts, very liberal.''
   In Karnack, the ground trembled in vibration for 58 seconds as
the motor of a Pershing II missile was ignited and burned its solid
fuel rocket propellant. Bolted in concrete and steel, the motor
remained stationary as it shot back a fiery tail and thick blossoms
of white smoke.
   The motor of a less-powerful Pershing 1-A missile was destroyed
the same way. It burned off in 37 seconds. After the firing, the
Pershing 1-A motor was hauled by forklift to a crushing machine and
destroyed. The larger Pershing II motor was to be destroyed later
after it cooled down.
   Bush, standing on a speaker's platform 1,300 feet away, watched
the firing through binoculars.
   When the smoke cleared, Bush declared, ``This has been a
spectacular day. God bless you. This has been a great day.''
   The Kremlin began destroying some of its missiles July 22 and as
of Sept. 6 had eliminated 92 rockets.
   After viewing the rocket-engine crushing and pronouncing it
``well done,'' the vice president was presented with two metal
fragments. He said he would give one to President Reagan and keep
the other for himself.
   Soviet officials at the event also gave him fragments of their
destroyed rockets.
   ``I hope the direction we're going in, in terms of destruction
and verifiable reductions, continues,'' Bush said. ``That was the
message I got there today. And I think the Soviets felt the same
way, the ones I talked to there.''
   Under the treaty, signed in Washington last December by Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and Soviet
Union are required to destroy all nuclear missiles with a range of
300 to 3,400 miles within three years.
   Officials of the Soviet Embassy in Washington and a team of
Soviet inspectors from Moscow were flown here to witness the
destruction of the U.S. weapons. ``We have become the eyewitnesses
of significant events,'' said Nikolai Shabolin, the chief Soviet
inspector.
   Bush, in brief remarks, said, ``We are witnessing today one of
those unique moments in the career of man. ... This was the day we
began to reverse the arms race; this was the day we began
destroying the weapons of destruction.''
   Bush then flew to Rockford, Ill., where he planned to address
the Illinois Federation of Republican women. Bush told a crowd of
about 200 well-wishers at the airport that ``Illinois is going to
be a battleground.''
   ``This is one of the critical four or five states in the entire
country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Man Stripped Of U.S. Citizenship Because of Death Camp Activity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A New Jersey man was stripped of his U.S.
citizenship Thursday after his attorney did not rebut government
claims that he served as a guard at a Nazi death camp during World
War II, federal prosecutors said.
   U.S. District Judge Clarkson S. Fisher ordered 62-year-old
Stefan Reger denaturalized after a telephone conference during
which Reger's attorney did not contest government motions for
summary judgment.
   Prosecutors alleged in court papers that Reger concealed his
wartime activities as a member of the SS Death's Head Battalion and
guard at the Birkenau section of the Auschwitz concentration camp
in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   The government said Reger was a native of Filipovo, Yugoslavia.
   In court papers filed in February, Reger acknowledged being a
member of Hitler's SS but denied guarding prisoners at Birkenau,
U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr., said in a statement.
   Alito said Reger is believed to be in Germany. Alito was not
available for further comment, and it was not immediately known
what further action the government might take against Reger.
   Reger, of the Trenton suburb of Yardville, has an unlisted
telephone number and could not be reached for comment. His son,
Michael, a contractor, was not at home Thursday and a woman who
said she was his wife declined to discuss the matter.
   Reger's attorney, John Barry, did not return a telephone message
left on his answering machine Thursday afternoon.
   Summary judgment occurs when attorneys ask that a judge rule in
their favor based on documents and testimony presented before the
case goes to trial.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations filed
a complaint in December 1987 seeking Reger's denaturalization. OSI
Director Neal M. Sher said Reger entered the United States in 1952
and became an U.S. citizen in 1957.
   According to the complaint, Reger, beginning in 1943, guarded
prisoners as they performed forced labor and were being transported
between camps.
   The complaint accused him of no specific acts.
   In his application to enter the United States, Reger said he
served in the 91st Grenadier Regiment of the German Army between
1943 and March 5, 1945, and as a Waffen-SS private until April 29
that year.
   Sher contended Reger should not have been allowed to become a
U.S. citizen because his activities during the war helped in the
persecution of civilians because of their race, religion or
national origin.
   The government's complaint said Reger joined the Waffen-SS in
1943 and served at Birkenau until January 1945, when he left to
guard a prisoner transport to another concentration camp.
   All documents related to the camps were destroyed by Hitler's
SS, making it difficult to determine how many people died at
Auschwitz, but the figure is put at 4 million.

   The House approved amendments to an anti-drug
bill Thursday that would permit federal death sentences for
murderers in drug felonies and deny many federal benefits to anyone
convicted of two narcotics offenses.
   Sponsors of the amendments rolled over opponents with arguments
that these criminal and administrative penalties would deter those
who use and profit from drugs.
   The death penalty amendment authored by Rep. George Gekas,
R-Pa., passed 299-111 and the benefit denials _ sponsored by Rep.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla. _ was approved 335-67. The provisions were
attached to a bill that would add some $2 billion to the nation's
existing $3.9 billion attack on illegal drugs.
   The House was unable to finish the bill Thursday night, and is
not expected to resume debate until next Wednesday. Before ending
debate, the lawmakers voted 259-134 for an amendment that would
permit introduction of illegally seized evidence in federal court
if police acted in ``good faith.''
   Opponents of the benefit denials offered an amendment to water
down the potential loss of student loans, public housing, veterans
benefits and other federal assistance.
   But they couldn't sway their colleagues, even by pointing out
the amendment would prevent burial of Medal of Honor winners in
Arlington National Cemetery.
   Battered death penalty opponents had argued that capital
punishment wouldn't stop hardened drug killers from murdering
someone.
   The death penalty provision would give federal judges the option
of handing down a death sentence to anyone convicted of
intentionally killing someone during a drug felony.
   The House also approved, 410-1, a measure providing for a
mandatory life term for such killers. That language _ opposed by
Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich. _ was proposed by death
penalty foes as an alternative, but those backing capital
punishment refused to stop there.
   McCollum's amendment would deny benefits for five years for
anyone convicted of two or more drug-related offenses within a
10-year period; and denial for 10 years for persons convicted of
drug distribution.
   Heads of federal agencies could restore benefits for those who
completed a drug rehabilitation program or were otherwise been
rehabilitated.
   Veterans benefits would be denied only to those convicted of
drug distribution. Retirement, welfare, health and disability
benefits would be exempted from the penalty.
   McCollum argued that ``education and rehabilitation are not
enough'' to stop demand and added, ``If we don't have a deterrent,
we won't win the war on the demand side. And if we don't win on the
demand side we won't win the war, period.''
   Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., asked if the House wanted to let a
drug trafficker send the message that ``I got involved in drugs in
Vietnam and therefore I'm excused.''
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., whose watered down version of
the benefit denials failed 278-124, told the House that entire
families in public housing could be thrown into the street if the
head of household had two drug convictions.
   And he asked, ``Does it make any sense, on the eve of
graduation, that we would cut off benefits'' to college students?
   Gekas said the death penalty amendment would provide a ``swift
and certain'' deterrent against drug killings.
   A Democratic supporter, Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio,
said, ``Drug dealers don't have to read anyone their rights. The
drug dealers who kill have no conscience.''
   Rangel, D-N.Y., said the sentiment for capital punishment was
linked to the upcoming election.
   ``We're now reaching the point, because it's on the eve of an
election, that we may find ourselves thrown into a position where
we have to explain to voters ... just who was the toughest on crime
... who was the toughest on drug traffickers,'' Rangel argued.
   ``Sometimes it's those who say `Let's kill the rascals' who
prevail.''
   Rangel said 36 states already have the death penalty, and ``if
the other 14 states want it, they can get it.''
   While the Senate has yet to consider its own anti-drug bill, it
already has expressed sentiment on capital punishment this year. A
separate bill approving the death penalty against drug dealers and
kingpins passed in June by a 65-29 margin.
   In 1986, the Senate's refusal to support the death penalty in
drug-related murders resulted in Congress eliminating the measure
from an anti-drug bill that year. The House had inserted capital
punishment in the 1986 bill by a vote of 296-112.
   Off the House floor, members were pressured by gun-control
advocates and opponents over a provision for a seven-day waiting
period for handgun purchases. The language also includes an
optional background check of the purchaser by law enforcement
authorities.
   The National Rifle Association is lobbying to remove the waiting
period, and pro-regulation groups are trying to save it. Both sides
have brought police officers to the Capitol to help in the lobbying
effort.
   Gekas' death penalty provision would permit _ but not require _
a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted of
intentionally killing someone during a drug felony.
   If the death penalty was not imposed, the amendment would
require a sentence of 20 years to life.
   The Senate legislation approved last June would permit the death
penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes;
and for drug ``kingpins,'' defined under law as those who supervise
five or more people, commit at least three federal drug felonies
and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable
because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into
compliance with Supreme Court guidelines on capital punishment..

   A Vietnamese diplomat who allegedly waved a gun at
protesters will surrender his immunity so British government
officials can question him, the Foreign Office said Thursday.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Tran Van Hung ``handed over a toy gun
which he said was the weapon the official had brandished'' in front
of Vietnamese refugees demonstrating outside the Vietnamese Embassy
on Sunday, a ministry spokesman said.
   During a meeting Thursday afternoon with Junior Minister Timothy
Eggar, the ambassador agreed the diplomat, third secretary Khang
Than Nhan, will surrender his immunity and visit the Foreign Office
for questioning, said the spokesman.
   It has not yet been decided whether police will attend the
interview, he said, speaking on condition he not be identified.
   The Foreign Office on Wednesday warned the ambassador he could
expect ``the gravest consequences'' if he refused to allow the
diplomat to be questioned. It also insisted the embassy surrender
any other weapons.
   Vietnamese protesters sent two photographs of the diplomat
holding a gun which were published Wednesday in the Daily Express
newspaper.
   The pictures showed a man with a pistol standing on the steps of
the embassy. The paper said the demonstrators were Vietnamese
refugees opposed to the current communist regime.
   Under the terms of the 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic
practice, embassies are treated as foreign territory.
   Although diplomats and other embassy staff are required to obey
local laws, they cannot be prosecuted unless the country concerned
agrees to waive their diplomatic immunity.

   Former leader Ne Win appears to be retaining
some control over the Burmese government and one suggestion in the
South Asian country's deepening crisis is for him to go into exile
in West Germany or Austria, a congressman just back from Rangoon
said Wednesday.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., told reporters that hundreds of
thousands of Burmese have already demonstrated ``they are ready to
lay down their lives'' for freedom, and the population will not
retreat from demands for swift change from dictatorship to
multi-party democracy.
   Also on Wednesday, the House approved by unanimous consent a
resolution introduced by Solarz urging democratic change in Burma.
   The resolution called for ``the establishment of a transitional
body, consisting of Burmese citizens who are unquestionably
committed to democracy and who have the confidence of the Burmese
people, to organize the holding of multi-party elections and
otherwise facilitate the establishment of a genuinely democratic
government.''
   Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asian and Pacific affairs, met numerous prominent Burmese during a
24-hour stopover in Rangoon last weekend en route home from Moscow
and Beijing. They included President Maung Maung, Prime Minister
Tun Tin and several student and opposition leaders, he said.
   A solution mentioned in the developing showdown is for Ne Win to
leave Burma, perhaps for West Germany, where he has spent time in
the past, Solarz said.
   ``As for West Germany, the potential role they have to play is
in terms of willingness _ if Ne Win expressed interest in leaving
the country _ to facilitate resolution of the crisis in permitting
him to go there,'' the New York Democrat said.
   If Ne Win decided to leave, West Germany ``is one of the places
he might choose to go to. The other leading contender is Austria,''
Solarz said, recalling his conversations with Burmese.
   Although Ne Win resigned July 23 as head of Burma's ruling
Socialist Program Party, Solarz said his talks in Rangoon gave him
``the impression that Ne Win continues to call the shots ...
   ``Virtually everybody I spoke to said he was not managing day to
day affairs, but there was the sense that no decision may be made
without his consent. There was also some evidence that key people
in government are beating a steady path to his door,'' he said.
   Solarz said the proposal of Ne Win's successors for a party
congress next week followed by a referendum on multi-party
democracy came too late and is ``utterly unacceptable to the
people.'' This is because the government has lost all credibility
and the proposal is regarded as a maneuver to cling to power, he
said.

   The former chancellor of the
University of California at Santa Barbara and his wife, convicted
of embezzlement and tax evasion, were sentenced Wednesday to five
years probation.
   Former chancellor Robert Huttenback also was ordered to pay
$60,000 in fines for one count of embezzlement and two counts of
tax evasion.
   Huttenback, 60, was also ordered to serve 1,000 hours of
community service.
   His wife, Freda, was fined $10,000 for one count of embezzlement
by Superior Court Judge Zel Canter.
   The Huttenbacks were convicted of siphoning more than $200,000
from university funds to remodel their home.
   Santa Barbara County Assistant District Attorney Patrick
McKinley had sought jail terms for the Huttenbacks. Defense
attorneys moved for a new trial, but the motion was denied.
   Huttenback, who resigned his post under pressure when the
embezzlement became known, declined comment after sentencing.
   Huttenback, a history scholar specializing in British
colonialism, served nine years as chancellor of the scenic coastal
campus about 100 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   River levels were stable or receding
Thursday and the Dhaka airport reopened so relief supplies can be
flown in, but distribution of aid to flood victims was slow and the
death toll continued climbing.
   The government said 609 people have died in floods that began
with the annual monsoon season in June, tapered off, then resumed
in devastating fashion Aug. 27. Daily tallies by Dhaka newspapers
total more than 1,300, which is considered more accurate.
   Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman said Thursday 510 people
drowned, died of snake bites or were killed when their houses
collapsed. The government health center reported 99 deaths from
diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water that flooded
three-quarters of the country's 55,000 square miles.
   Health center officials reported 135,537 known cases of diarrhea
nationwide, an increase of 15,715 in the previous 24 hours, but
that includes only areas in communication with the capital.
   Officials say about one-quarter of Bangladesh's 110 million
people are homeless.
   Many still are stranded on rooftops, in boats and on the rare
patches of high ground in Bangladesh, most of which is a vast river
delta. Water levels in flood areas range from a few inches to more
than 10 feet.
   Rahman insisted there was no shortage of water purification
tablets, but his assertion seemed questionable.
   More than two dozen people interviewed at random Thursday in
relief camps, flooded buildings and on rooftops in Dhaka said they
had no purification tablets and were drinking water that could be
dangerous.
   ``Most of us have fevers and headaches,'' said Lily, a
17-year-old seamstress camping out at the Fair Fashion company
factory with 10 co-workers. She said they paid 31 cents a day for
about five gallons of tap water.
   Lily and a co-worker, 20-year-old Shamima, said they had heard
of water purification tablets, but Lily said ``No one has given us
any and we don't have enough money to buy any.''
   A diplomat from a Western nation that has tried to buy water
purification tablets for relief distribution reported searching in
vain for sufficient quantities in Bangladesh and nearby countries.
Representatives of other aid donors made similar reports, all on
condition of anonymity.
   Pledges of disaster aid reached a total of at least $60 million
Thursday, according to figures for individual nations reported by
Rahman, the information minister.
   Included are $16.9 million in goods and cash from Japan, $3.6
million from the United States, and $6.5 million each from France
and the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent
societies. Much of the aid will take the form of food, blankets and
medicine.
   Britain said it will send $11.9 million in new aid. The Foreign
Office said in London on Thursday that the aid supplements $800,000
already pledged.
   Prospects for getting it to Bangladesh brightened with the
opening of Dhaka's airport to all aircraft. More than half the
10,000-foot runway was flooded this week, and only helicopters and
smaller commercial aircraft were landing.
   The World Food Program issued a statement in Rome saying the
greatest problem is moving the aid to where it is needed.
   ``Relief distribution is being carried out by boats, barges and
tugs and a very limited number of helicopters,'' the U.N. agency
said. ``The government of Bangladesh has appealed for more
logistical assistance.''
   Rahman told reporters neighboring countries agreed to study the
flood problem in an effort to control the annual deluges carried by
rivers that originate in India and Nepal.
   He said the problem was put on the agenda of the December
meeting of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation.
   The three mightiest rivers that run through the country to the
Bay of Bengal are the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna.
   Floods are a problem every monsoon season, but the inundation
this year is the worst for many years in Bangladesh, whose rivers
cover 10 percent of its territory even in normal times.
   Rapid deforestation in India and Nepal has contributed to the
problem because bare soil cannot retain as much water, according to
geographers, government officials and U.N. specialists.
   A report from the Bangladesh flood warning and forecast center
said the Ganges and Meghna continued receding slightly Thursday and
the Brahmaputra held its level, with all three still above flood
stage.

   Michael Dukakis told war veterans
Thursday he does not question George Bush's patriotism but ``I
question his priorities,'' and said the massive federal debt
threatens the nation's military strength.
   ``Military might cannot be sustained without economic might,''
said the Democratic presidential nominee. ``We cannot build a
strong national defense on a mountain of debt.''
   Dukakis received a polite, sometimes warm reception in an
address to the annual convention of the American Legion, the
nation's largest organization of veterans of war-time military
service.
   He later flew to Buffalo, N.Y., to tour a General Motors engine
plant, then attended a gala fund-raiser in New York City that the
campaign said would raise $5 million for the fall effort.
   He shook hands with Jesse Jackson, who told reporters: ``I'm
available to campaign....upon request of the ticket.''
   Dukakis steered clear of mentioning in his speech the strategic
weapons systems proposed by the Reagan administration that he
opposes _ such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, and the
Star Wars nuclear defense system.
   In a news conference later, Dukakis said he supports continued
Star Wars research at the reduced level of $1 billion a year but
believes testing and deployment of such a nuclear-shield system
would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which he
supports as in the nation's best interest.
   ``If I made the judgment and if Congress made the judgment it
was essential to our national security, then obviously we would
proceed with it. But we don't know that at this point,'' Dukakis
said.
   Dukakis has belittled the program, known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative, in his campaign speeches. He has called it a
``fantasy'' and said the country needs ``star schools not Star
Wars,'' while at the same time supporting continued research at
1982 levels.
   He faced repeated questioning about what appeared to be a change
in tone if not position. He said he favored research as a way ``to
keep our options open.''
   
   ``I'm for continued research, but to commit billions that we
don't have ... to a system that is untested, untried and unproven,
and which Mr. Bush himself apparently changed positions on a week
ago, in my judgment doesn't serve the national interest,'' Dukakis
said. He referred to Bush's recent remarks that suggested he was
softening support for SDI deployment.
   Dukakis followed by a day an appearance before the same group by
Bush, the vice president and Republican presidential nominee who
has attacked Dukakis as soft on defense for opposing new weapons
systems.
   
   Dukakis, an Army veteran, wore a Legion convention medal on his
lapel and a pin commemorating soldiers missing in action _ but did
not wear a legionnaire's cap _ during a speech that was interrupted
repeatedly by applause.
   He critized the Reagan administration for misspending some
defense money on weapons system that don't work and attacked the
administration and Bush for supporting cuts in veterans benefits,
including cuts in the Veterans Administration hospital system.
   
   ``My opponent in this election is a patriotic man who served his
country well in time of war,'' Dukakis said. ``I do not question
his love for this country. But there are days _ and this is one of
them _ when I question his priorities.''
   
   Bush used similar words before the Legion, saying he did not
question Dukakis' patriotism but his support for a strong defense.
   
   Dukakis said Bush supports a capital gains tax break that would
benefit the wealthy, and compared that position with what he said
was Bush's vote to break a Senate tie to cut VA health care
benefits by $2 billion and to eliminate cost of living increases
for disabled veterans.
   
   ``What kind of priorities are those? A tax cut for those who
have it made. A cut in income for those who lost a leg at Normandy
or were blinded at Inchon or had an arm torn off at Khe Sanh,'' he
said.
   
   Dukakis praised the U.S.-Soviet treaty reducing
intermediate-range nuclear missiles and said, ``I salute President
Reagan for it.'' But he said the country should strengthen
conventional forces while working to ``build on that treaty.''
   ``We cannot rest here because today, after eight years and $2
trillion, we still don't have an anti-tank weapon that can stop
modern Soviet tanks. We have serious shortages in ammunition and
spare parts and maintenance. We see billions being spent on weapons
that don't do what they are designed to do. And we see too many
defense dollars slipping into the pockets of wheeler dealers and
consultants,'' he said.
   At his news conference, Dukakis made light of Bush's
misstatement before the Legion group that Sept. 7 was the
anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack was
on Dec. 7, 1941.
   ``I didn't know there were only 16 shopping days to Christmas
until yesterday,'' Dukakis said.
   He shrugged off a question about the latest poll showing him
eight points down, and the suggestion his campaign is in disarray.
``I don't think we're slipping and I don't think we're in
disarray,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Firefighters on Thursday
for the first time closed all but a small piece of the oldest
national park, devastated by fires that surrounded Old Faithful and
charred more than 1 million acres.
   ``I've done this for 20 years and I've never seen anything as
awesome as this,'' said Fred Roach, operations chief on the
221,800-acre North Fork fire, which destroyed 17 buildings in the
park Wednesday.
   Winds died down and temperatures cooled Thursday, and a weekend
weather forecast called for rain or snow _ but also for winds up to
60 mph.
   ``It looks as if the burn that went through yesterday pretty
much fire-proofed the Old Faithful area,'' North Fork commander
Denny Bungarz said. ``The priorities have switched now that the
fire has gone around here.''
   Some firefighters and equipment that had been deployed around
Old Faithful were moved elsewhere Thursday because of the reduced
threat to the geyser development, officials said.
   Firefighters in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest used a
helicopter and tracking dogs to search for a crewman missing from
fire lines since Wednesday night, but reported that he returned to
camp under his own power.
   About 150 residents evacuated Sunday from Silver Gate and Cooke
City, small Montana towns on the edge of the park, were allowed to
go home, but a spot fire closed the highway. Firefighters used
backfires Tuesday to save the towns.
   Fire officials warned that a wind shift could send the
119,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire back at the canyon towns
and force another evacuation.
   Fires also burned in Alaska, Idaho, California, Oregon,
Washington and Utah, where four cabins were destroyed by flames.
   Although federal officials have called this the worst fire
season in 30 years, no fatalities have been directly attributed to
the blazes, which have charred 3.65 million acres, an area larger
than Connecticut.
   However, one man was killed Aug. 19 when a private helicopter
crashed in the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming on Aug. 19. The
helicopter was on its way to a wilderness area to replace batteries
in fire communications equipment.
   President Reagan is sending a Cabinet-level team to the West to
see what additional federal help is needed in fighting fires, and
the White House said the number of troops on the fire line is
likely to be increased. So far, about 2,500 military personnel are
fighting fires.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan met with Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel and Deputy
Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV. The three plan to leave for
Yellowstone on Friday.
   At Yellowstone, officials opened only an eight-mile section of
road from the north entrance at Gardiner, Mont., to the Swan Lake
flats, and a 14-mile stretch from the west entrance to Madison
Junction, park spokesmen said.
   Most of the 2.2 million-acre park, which includes about 250
miles of roadway, was closed to ensure an open path for fire trucks
and to protect tourists from the roaring flames. Park officials
said it is the first time such a large area in Yellowstone has been
closed.
   The only tourist attraction open was Mammoth Hot Springs, which
includes a hotel and campground, a restaurant, visitors center,
employees dormitory and a small grocery store.
   Wind gusts up to 85 mph Wednesday briefly trapped some crews and
tourists and destroyed 17 buildings. The strong wind knocked down
trees in the complex, including a 50-foot pine next to the main
entrance of historic Old Faithful Inn. The building was not
damaged, and tourists had evacuated earlier.
   ``Trees were just popping like matchsticks,'' said Robert Lee, a
firefighter from Auburn, Ala.
   Firefighters on Thursday hosed down the still-smoldering rubble
of nearby cabins, many with only metal fixtures and bed springs
identifiable. Crews also cleared fuel in the complex around the
park's most famous attraction.
   Heavy smoke blanketed the area, and small licks of fire could be
seen in many spots on either side of the road. Flames continued to
threaten the structures remaining, said Roach, the fire operations
chief.
   In Bridger-Teton National Forest, where missing crewman Pete
Alire, 36, of El Rito, N.M., returned unharmed to camp around noon,
authorities said they planned to investigate his disappearance from
the fire lines Wednesday.
   In Montana's Glacier National Park, firefighters struggled to
flank the 14,000-acre Red Bench forest fire that has burned more
than a dozen homes, but officials were reluctant to assign crews to
the leading edge of the fire.
   ``In a situation like this when you've got 20 mph winds and a
large, very dry area of lodgepole pine, the only things that will
slow it down are rain, humidity and natural barriers,'' information
officer Jim Payne said.
   About 1,400 firefighters were on the lines of Montana's
238,400-acre Canyon Creek fire near the Idaho border, which was
mostly stalled by cool temperatures Thursday.
   Fires have burned about 200,000 acres in the rugged canyons of
central Idaho, including seven wilderness fires in the Nez Perce
National Forest that continue to burn out of control.
   The Entiat fire in the Swakane Canyon area of central Washington
is the state's biggest forest fire, and has consumed 36,170-acres
of wildlife habitat. Five other blazes, mostly contained, have
burned about 70,000 acres.

   A woman whose car was seized at the border
because agents found two 50-cent pipes from Mexico says the agency
carried Zero Tolerance too far.
   A U.S. Customs Service spokesman in Houston confirmed that no
drugs were found but said Teresa Miller's car was seized Sunday
because of ``paraphernalia.''
   Custom officials said Thursday the car would be returned.
   Ms. Miller, who lives in suburban Houston, said Wednesday that
her friend, Valerie Cantrell, bought the pipes in Mexico, where the
two had gone shopping.
   ``It's appalling,'' said Ms. Miller, 27, a clerical worker at a
Pasadena law office. ``I'm an American citizen, and I should have
rights. First off, they (the pipes) were not even mine.''
   Ms. Cantrell, 23, who also does clerical work at the law office,
said the onyx pipes were among several knick-knacks she bought and
were a gift for a friend. Ms. Cantrell said neither she or Ms.
Miller use drugs.
   The seizure, at the U.S. port of entry at Progreso, stems from
the administration's Zero Tolerance policy, designed to curtail the
demand for drugs, Customs spokesman Charles Conroy said.
   Customs officials announced Thursday afternoon that they would
release the car back to Ms. Miller if she or someone else returns
to Progreso and claims it, and Conroy said it had been decided that
no charges would be filed.
   ``That seizure has been canceled by the U.S. Customs Service,''
Conroy said. ``We considered all the facts involved and the
circumstances in the case and came to the conclusion that the
seizure did not fit the spirit and intent of the Zero Tolerance
program.''
   Conroy said he was not aware of any decision to reimburse Ms.
Miller for her additional travel expenses. Houston is about 350
miles from Progreso.
   The women said they had been told that the car, on which Ms.
Miller still owes $5,800, would be put up for auction if the appeal
was rejected.
   Chris Peacock, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
had said the matter was being looked into. He added that five
complaints had been received in the last month about seizures along
the Texas border.
   Conroy said that from March 21, when Zero Tolerance took effect,
through June, 474 vehicles have been seized in the Customs
Service's southwest region _ Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona and New
Mexico.

   A transcript of cockpit conversation on Delta
Flight 1141 reveals the crew knew their jetliner was in serious
trouble about 21 seconds before it crashed Aug. 31 at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The transcript of a tape shows that about nine seconds after an
apparently normal takeoff, a cockpit alarm showed the Boeing 727
was not able to gather enough speed to stay aloft, the Dallas Times
Herald reported.
   The Salt Lake City-bound plane exploded and exploded and broke
apart on impact, killing 13 of the 108 people on board.
   Eleven secords before impact, Capt. Larry Lon Davis exclaimed,
``We're not gunna make it!'' One of the final entries on the
transcript appears to be a scream.
   The unauthorized release of the transcript drew sharp criticism
from John Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association in
Washington, D.C., who warned, ``There will probably be some
repercussions.''
   It will be months before investigators pinpoint the cause of the
crash, but two primary suspects have emerged. They are wing flaps,
designed to give the plane lift, and engine problems during the
flight.
   The transcript reveals that flight engineer Steven Judd and
co-pilot Carey Kirkland went through a standard preparation
checklist.
   In the transcript, Kirkland told Judd that the flaps were
extended in the correct position for normal takeoff during the
checklist less than a minute before the plane received permission
for takeoff.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said last
week that the cockpit recording indicates there were two compressor
stalls, which are disruptions of air flow, one each in two of the
engines.
   The transcript, however, notes five possible compressor stalls
within six seconds, a set of two followed within seconds by three
more, the newspaper reported.
   Investigators have not been able to determine whether any
compressor stalls actually occurred, safety board officials said.
The engines are to be tested at the Pratt & Whitney manufacturing
plant in East Hartford, Conn.
   Mazor said he believes the transcript, which he said appears to
be a very relevant portion of the cockpit tape, may have been
released ``to point the finger (of blame) away from whoever was
doing the leaking,'' but said he would not speculate on who that
may have been.
   The release of one piece of evidence in an investigation that
make take nearly a year is ``folly'' and may lead people to draw
wrong and unfair conclusions, Mazor said.
   ``This has happened many times in the past, and we've complained
many times in the past,'' Mazor said.
   He said the pilots union may consider filing a complaint with
the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating
the crash, about the transcript's early release.
   ``We got it from an investigator,'' said Ray Herndon, an
assistant managing editor of the Times Herald, but the newspaper
would not disclose what agency the investigator worked for.
   A spokesman for the transportation safety board in Washington,
D.C., said the board also is upset that a major portion of the
transcript was leaked to the newspaper.
   ``We're upset because that transcript is an unauthorized,
preliminary and incomplete version,'' said the NTSB spokesman,
Michael Benson. ``By law, that transcript is not to be released for
60 days. We make every effort to ensure the transcript is
confidential.''
   Benson said there is no way to determine who gave the transcript
to the Times Herald. ``A number of parties have access to that
transcript,'' including the pilots union, he said.
   Benson said NTSB officials are reviewing security procedures to
see if they must be changed to prevent such documents from being
leaked to the press in the future.

   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan was rushed
to Georgetown University Hospital when he fainted after giving a
speech Thursday night, hospital officials said.
   Rowan's condition and the cause of his collapse were not
immediately available, but Georgetown University spokesman Jim
Kurtzke said the columnist was ``alert, he's conscious, he's
sitting up.''
   An ambulance dispatcher, who would not give his name, said Rowan
was taken to the hospital about 9:11 p.m. EDT for apparent heat
exhaustion.
   Rowan was leaving a lecture hall at American University after
giving a speech on the presidential campaign when he collapsed, a
student who was nearby said.
   ``He walked up the stairs, paused, and was leaning forward over
a sign,'' said Michelle Karpf, a freshman at American.
   ``He said, `Oh, it's kind of warm in there,' and he wasn't
feeling well,'' she said. ``I looked back over, and he was lying on
the ground.''
   ``He was holding his chest,'' Karpf said. ``Nobody really knew
what was going on. People were running around going, `Does anybody
know CPR?'''
   About a dozen people were around Rowan trying to ask questions
when he collapsed, she said.
   ``He was conscious when they took him away,'' in the ambulance,
Karpf said.
   Rowan, 52, has been the target of national publicity recently
for shooting a teenage intruder who had taken an unauthorized
midnight dip in Rowan's back yard swimming pool.
   The columnist, generally known for his liberal views and an
outspoken opponent of handgun use, is scheduled to stand trial
Sept. 22 on charges that he used an unregistered handgun and
ammunition in the June 14 shooting.
   Rowan has argued that the weapon and bullets were given to him
by his son, Carl Rowan Jr., a former FBI agent, who has said he was
told by District of Columbia officials that he did not have to
register the weapon.
   The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that
all weapons be registered.
   If convicted on both misdemeanor charges, Rowan faces a maximum
penalty of two years in prison and $2,000 in fines.

   Tropical Storm Florence moved north in the southern
Gulf of Mexico on Thursday, and forecasters said high-level winds
were preventing it from strengthening as much as expected.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the National Hurricane Center reported
Florence had 55 mph winds and was drifting north at 5 mph, about
375 miles south of New Orleans. The storm center was near latitude
24.5 north and longitude 89.2 west.
   Forecaster Jim Gross said air currents high above Florence were
blowing the top off its thunderstorms, keeping winds from
intensifying to the 74 mph level that would classify the system as
a hurricane.
   ``Right now it's maintaining the status quo,'' Gross said. He
added that because of weak steering currents, it was impossible to
predict where the storm was headed.
   ``We're still looking at a threat, but we don't know what
direction it is going to take,'' Gross said.
   He said it was not unusual for a storm to stall in the Gulf for
several days before moving toward land.
   The Louisiana Office of State Parks said Thursday that Grand
Isle State Park would be closed Friday because of high tides caused
by the approaching tropical storm.
   Spokeswoman Debbie Woodiel said she did not know how long the
park, which is on the Gulf of Mexico, would be closed.
   Florence is the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season. Only Debby, which also formed in the Gulf, reached minimal
hurricane status briefly.
   The 12th and 13th tropical depressions of the season formed in
the Atlantic late Thursday afternoon.
   The 12th was centered about 300 miles east-southeast of Barbados
with top winds of about 30 mph. The depression was drifting
westward at 10-15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for
the next 24 hours.
   The 13th depression was located about 400 miles northeast of the
Cape Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa, moving north at
20-25 mph with winds of 35 mph. The system was not expected to
intensify, forecasters said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Charges LA County With Vote Bias Against
Hispanics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department sued Los Angeles
County and its top officials Thursday, alleging that the county's
1981 redistricting plan has denied Hispanics equal voting rights.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks to invalidate
the electoral boundaries set for the county's five elected
supervisors, and to devise a new plan that complies with federal
law.
   County Board of Supervisors Chairman Deane Dana said the lawsuit
was expected, and added it is ``unfortunate that the Justice
Department has elected to take its action so near to the 1990
census.''
   Supervisor Mike Antonovich agreed, saying ``It makes more sense
to wait 16 months for the next census than to use antiquated
statistics from 1980 as the basis for reapportionment.''
   Antonovich also denied that there has been any pattern of racial
discrimination by the Board of Supervisors. However, leaders of
local Hispanic and civil rights groups welcomed the suit as long
overdue.
   ``I think it makes it utterly uncontestable that there can be a
continuation of the white enclave that has governed Los Angeles
County,'' said Mark Rosenbaum, an attorney with the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   The 1981 districts were ``gerrymandered to dilute the power of
latino communities to elect a leader of their own choosing,'' said
Alan Clayton, a California representative for the League of United
Latin American Citizens.
   A discrimination case also was filed against the county last
month by the ACLU and the Mexican American Legal Defense Education
Fund, which called the Board of Supervisors ``the most exclusive,
most powerful whites-only club in the nation.''
   The Justice Department's suit most likely be consolidated with
the suit filed by the ACLU and MALDEF, Rosenbaum said.
   The county, which has an annual operating budget of about $8.9
billion, comprises an estimated 8.5 million residents, with each
supervisor representing between 1.6 million and 1.7 million people,
Clayton said.
   A similar Justice Department discrimination suit was filed
aginst the city of Los Angeles in 1985, leading to a settlement
that radically revised City Council districts in the San Fernando
Valley and in East Los Angeles.
   The federal lawsuit charges that the county's electoral plan
fragments the county's geographically cohesive Hispanic community,
thus denying Hispanics an equal opportunity to participate in the
political process and to elect candidates of their choice to the
county governing body.
   Named as defendants, in addition to the county, were the Board
of Supervisors; Dana; Antonovich; and Supervisors Peter F.
Schabarum, Kenneth Hahn, Edmund D. Edelman, and Registar-Recorder
Charles Weissburd.
   Schabarum did not immediately respond to a telephone call
seeking comment, and Edelman declined to comment.
   Hahn said in a prepared statement, ``I believe this could have
been avoided if this past June 21st, the Board of Supervisors had
approved my motion to place a measure on the November ballot to
expand the board to seven members.''
   The Justice Department suit alleges that in 1970, Hispanics
numbered 1,289,311, or 18.3 percent of the total population. In
1980, the suit says, the county's Hispanic population rose to
2,066,103, or 27.6 percent of the total population of 7,477,503.
   Blacks comprised 12.4 percent, or 926,361, and Asians and
Pacific Islanders 5.8 percent, 434,850, of the 1980 population.
   The suit says the Hispanic population stretched from the City of
Los Angeles on the west to the San Gabriel Valley on the east,
comprising about 73 percent of the more than 1.2 million people
residing in the 230 contiguous census tracts and constituting what
is called a ``community of interest.''
   The 1981 reapportionment plan adopted by the Board of
Supervisors divided the concentration of Hispanic voters into three
districts, with the result that Hispanics did not constitute a
voting-age majority or plurality in any of the five single-member
districts.
   Clayton charged that the county also has systemically
discriminated against Hispanics in its employment policies. He
cited a recent study that found that Hispanics make up about 18.3
percent of the government's work force, while county hiring goals
call for a 27.6 percent representation.
   The Justice Department complaint says that non-partisan
elections in Los Angeles County, including those for the Board of
Supervisors, are characterized by patterns of racial and ethnic
bloc voting.

   A space mission that endangered two cosmonauts
was hastily organized for ``pure propaganda'' reasons and the
crewmen were lucky to escape with their lives, according to an
American expert on the Soviet space program.
   James Oberg said Soyuz TM-5, with an Afghan crewman aboard, was
rushed into space a year ahead of schedule to assure that it flew
before Soviet troops completed withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``They asked for this trouble by throwing this mission together
for pure propaganda,'' Oberg, a space engineer and author of
several books on the Soviet space program, said in a telephone
interview.
   The craft landed safely Wednesday after a tense 24 hours in
which malfunctions threatened to leave the cosmonauts marooned in
orbit.

   Sen. Dan Quayle got a warm welcome from his
colleagues his first day back on the job since becoming George
Bush's running mate, but the message from Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole was mixed at best.
   Dole praised Quayle as ``a rising young star in our party'' at a
Capitol reception Wednesday, but later he stopped short of calling
Quayle an asset to the Republican ticket when pressed by reporters.
   ``I think he's becoming an asset,'' Dole said. Did that mean the
senator thought Quayle had achieved that status yet, he was asked.
``Becoming,'' Dole repeated.

   The Senate is preparing to act on proposed new
limits on textile, apparel and shoe imports, giving little heed to
complaints that it is reverting to protectionism.
   ``The textile and apparel industries will be extinct in a few
years unless the flooding of our markets is stopped,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., said Wednesday as the Senate voted 68-29 to force
action on the longstanding issue.
   The Senate voted to limit debate, giving opponents of the
proposed restrictions no more than 30 hours to express their
objections. As a result, action on the bill is expected by Friday

   The federal government sued Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and the head of its high-risk junk bond business,
alleging they secretly schemed with convicted inside-trader Ivan
Boesky to violate securities laws.
   Wednesday's civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange
Commission seeks an estimated $100 million, according to Sen.
William Proxmire, D-Wis.
   It followed months of guessing about whether the government had
built an extensive case against the Wall Street firm on evidence
turned up during the nearly 2-year-old Boesky scandal, which
resulted in his imprisonment.
   The SEC's complaint accuses Drexel and Michael Milken, head of
Drexel's pioneering junk bond operation, of engaging in an
arrangement with Boesky that included insider trading, stock
manipulation and fraud that benefited Boesky and Drexel at the
expense of Drexel clients. Junk bonds, which offer high yields but
are highly risky, are often used to finance corporate takeovers.
   Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick H. Joseph,
reiterated the company's longstanding claim that it would be
absolved of any charges. Milken also again denied any wrongdoing.

   With a deafening roar and towering clouds
of white smoke, two nuclear-missile rocket motors were destroyed
Thursday, the first U.S. weapons eliminated under the arms
reduction treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Vice President George Bush and a 12-member Soviet inspection
team were among hundreds of observers who watched the burnings at
the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in northeast Texas, about 145
miles east of Dallas.
   Afterward, the Soviet team said it was satisified with the
burnings.
   ``This is the day we begin to reverse the arms race. This was
the day we began to destroy the weapons of destruction,'' Bush said
after the missles were destroyed. ``This was the day that two great
nuclear powers began to move together toward a safer, more peaceful
world.''
   At the White House, Reagan said he had asked Bush to attend the
event in his place, and he added, ``I think this step for peace is
something we all can be very proud of.''

   The House voted 299-111 Thursday to amend an
anti-drug bill to permit federal death sentences for those
convicted of murder committed during narcotics-related felonies.
   The vote was a major defeat for death penalty foes, who sought a
mandatory life sentence for drug killers as an alternative.
   The life sentence provision also passed, 410-1, but the
pro-death penalty forces wouldn't stop there. They rammed through
the capital punishment amendment to give federal judges an
additional option.
   The capital punishment issue was the first major controversy
addressed as the House considered legislation that would add some
$2 billion to the $3.9 billion the nation is now spending to combat

   The government said 609 people have died in floods that began

   The warning was called out by one of the officers in the

   South Korea has made significant improvements in

government still holds 600 political prisoners and tortures some of
them, Amnesty International said Thursday.
   The human rights group said in a report that some political
prisoners were jailed after unfair trials but that torture has
decreased.
   Government sensitivity to world attention during the Sept. 17 to
Oct. 2 Olympics may help improve the situation, but the Games do
not guarantee changes, a representative of the London-based group
said.
   The report said South Korea should release more political
prisoners, end torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and change
laws to allow peaceful expression of opposition to the government.

plan to boost plant and equipment spending to record levels this
year as capital investment remains one of the strongest sectors of

previous high of $391.6 billion set in 1985.
   This 11.6 percent increase over the 1987 spending total, if
realized, would mark the biggest percentage jump since a 16.6
percent rise in 1984, when American industry was still recovering
from the steep 1981-82 recession.

   Pope John Paul II's latest trip to southern
Africa will take him to an impoverished region of refugees and
rebels, but he will pointedly avoid segregated South Africa, the
region's economic powerhouse.
   The pope leaves Saturday on his fourth trip to Africa and his
39th abroad. He will go to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland
and Mozambique, countries that vehemently oppose South Africa but
depend on it for economic survival.
   South Africa dominates communications, trade, transportation and
politics in southern Africa, and its influence will be felt
strongly during the pope's 10-day trip.
   South African firms are supplying such items as transportation,
food, water and health services, broadcasting and emergency
equipment and even papal souvenirs to be used on many of the pope's
stops.
   John Paul, 68, has been critical of South African apartheid
throughout his nearly 10-year-long pontificate.

   Young men who go out at night with romance in

   Ozone, a major component of smog and a product of lightning
storms, damages the latex in condoms, and any practice threatening
to tear condoms' packaging and expose them to air should be
avoided, the researchers said.
   ``It's not something you should subject to putting in your back
pocket, or sitting on, or in any way damaging,'' said Russell P.
Sherwin, a researcher at the University of Southern California
School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
   Ozone is a lung irritant produced when industrial pollutants and
nitrogen oxide react in the presence of sunlight. It reaches high
levels in U.S. cities inhabited by a total of 75 million people,
the federal Environmental Protection Agency estimated earlier this
year.

<HEAD>Night Ark: A Unique Fusion of Jazz, Armenian Melodies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ara Dinkjian, leader of the group Night Ark,
talks about his music by first explaining what it's not: pop, jazz,
folk or classical.
   Yet the lyrical and often haunting compositions of the band meld
them all into a curiously attractive, eclectic fusion of Eastern
and Western styles.
   ``You hear a very strong Middle Eastern, Armenian flavor with
all of the other elements creeping in and out'' of the music of
Night Ark, says Dinkjian.
   ``Most Americans have a further history in Europe or in Asia
that's a part of them. What I'm doing is opening my eyes and my
heart to everything that I am and have been,'' he said.
   Dinkjian, who lives in Nutley, N.J., has a diverse musical
background. At age 5 he performed at the New York World's Fair as
part of an Armenian ensemble and grew up listening to the Beatles
and jazz. He studied Western classical music in college.
   In Night Ark, Dinkjian plays a variety of exotic Middle Eastern
stringed instruments _ oud, cumbus, canoon, saz _ and writes and
arranges most of the four-piece band's music.
   Keyboardist Armen Donelian and percussionist Arto Tuncboyaci
share Dinkjian's Armenian heritage, while bassist Ed Schuller finds
in Night Ark an opportunity to explore new sounds and technique.
   While the band members decline to call their music jazz, they
perform mostly in jazz clubs, and Night Ark's two albums on the RCA
Novus label are targeted primarily at jazz audiences. Those
audiences, Dinkjian says, are generally receptive to Night Ark's
often unconventional rhythms and melodies.
   At its best, Night Ark plays a distinctive and frequently
compelling music reminiscent of the Turkish-inspired jazz played a
number of years ago by flutist Herbie Mann.
   But at its worst, the band drifts into lazy renditions of
timeworn pop standards, producing a music that ends up sounding
like some uninspired New Age elevator music.
   ``The major disappointment is in the squandering of talent and
ideas on a lame version of Carole King's `You've Got a Friend,'''
says William Kinnally reviewing Night Ark's second album,
``Moments,'' in Jazziz magazine.
   But, performing recently at the jazz club Fat Tuesday's, Night
Ark relied on its original compositions to charm receptive
listeners.
   Night Ark _ the name is a reference to biblical Noah's Ark,
which, legend has it, came to rest on Armenia's Mount Ararat _
retains several Middle Eastern musical fundamentals to produce its
sound.
   ``Between two adjacent notes on a piano, there's an infinite
amount of notes'' that are inaccessible to Western instruments but
can be played by Eastern musicians, Dinkjian said.
   ``Sometimes when people hear an Arabic song it sounds out of
tune,'' he said. ``The reason why my music doesn't sound strange is
that I have slipped in all of those funny notes but carefully added
the harmony behind it. We've kind of buffered it.''
   Night Ark also employs rhythms unusual in Western music.
   ``This is not a jazz fusion gimmick; this is the beat I was
brought up with,'' Dinkjian said.
   The insistent percussion ``is not alienating the Western
audience, but tries to bring them in and say `Welcome. You're going
to like this.'''

<HEAD>Moyers' Eclectic New Interview Series on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yes, after a while it does get to be tedious,
praising all these Bill Moyers programs on PBS, informing the
deprived TV populace that they are missing some of the best stuff
on television by not switching that selector away from NBC or Fox
or HBO.
   Moyers' Constitution series was fascinating. The Joseph Campbell
interviews were inspired. Couldn't Moyers, just once, produce some
kind of lame drivel that could be lambasted for a change?
   Apparently not, at least for now. Moyers embarks Monday on a new
series of interviews, ``Bill Moyers' World of Ideas,'' with an
eclectic group of guests, though judging from the first few shows,
they seem to have a common theme about ethics and societal
responsibilities.
   The series of nightly, half-hour interviews continues for 10
weeks. If that seems like a lot, figure it's worth it to check in
once in a while when you're likely to drop in on a conversation
with anybody from sportswriter Robert Angell to Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright August Wilson. Most of the interview
subjects are authors, some scientists and others philosophers.
   In the first week, Moyers talks to British film producer David
Puttnam, environmental scientist Jessica Tuchman Mathews, ethicist
Michael Josephson and historian Henry Steele Commager. Part 2 of
the Puttnam interview rounds out the week.
   In Monday's premiere, Puttnam, producer of ``Chariots of Fire,''
``The Killing Fields'' and ``The Mission,'' discusses what he sees
as the moral decay of the movie industry, a degeneration of message
to money. Puttnam knows whereof he speaks since he won an Oscar and
later became head of Columbia Pictures, only to be bounced out for
going against the system.
   Puttnam grew up in England, Moyers in Texas. Both recall images
from the silver screen that strongly affected their sense of the
world. It is this often profound effect on the formation of ideals,
Puttnam argues, for which the filmmaker must take responsibility.
Instead, he argues, many moviemakers sneer at audiences while
picking their pockets.
   ``We've all got to look past this thing and say, well, where are
we going to be in the year 2000?'' he says. ``Are we literally
going to live in tiny enclaves with individual armed guards,
pouring rubbish over the fence in the form of television material,
films or even journalism at an undereducated and increasingly
irresponsible society on the outside?''
   ``But I go to the movies to be entertained,'' Moyers counters,
``not to be lectured. Do I really want David Puttnam sitting there
saying, `What kind of moral instruction can I give Bill Moyers when
pays me seven dollars?'''
   ``No, you don't,'' says Puttnam. ``You have every right not to
want that, but, again, I think there's an underlying poverty of
ambition, if you like. I've never accepted that there's any
dichotomy at all between entertaining you, Bill Moyers, and also
dealing in an issue, addressing you with an issue. I don't think
there's any dichotomy at all, and I think it's the job of the
responsible filmmaker _ or of the good filmmaker, forget
`responsible' _ to deal in both.''
   Puttnam admits he tripped in the moral mine field when he made
``Midnight Express'' to prove he wasn't just a maker of ``art''
films, and could produce a commercial hit. The movie was about a
young American, Billy Hays, imprisoned in a hellish Turkish jail
for drug smuggling. In the climactic scene, Hays bites off the
tongue of one of his tormentors.
   Puttnam meant the scene as a horrific portrayal of how demented
Hays had become in the brutal prison world. But Puttnam was
appalled when he sat in a movie house and heard the audience cheer
the scene.
   ``That's when I said to myself, `Never again.' I don't ever want
to sit and look at a film that I've had any responsibility at all
for and be stunned and shattered by the reaction it's getting from
the audience,'' he said.
   In the second half of the interview, Puttnam expresses regret
for turning down ``Moonstruck'' when he was at Columbia, though he
says the script he saw wasn't as good as the movie turned out to
be. He also says he didn't think ``Chariots of Fire'' deserved the
Oscar as Best Picture when it won in 1981. Between it and the later
runner-up in that category, ``The Killing Fields,'' Puttnam says,
they did add up to one Academy Award.
   Moyers' other guests in the next few weeks will include, among
many others, American authors Tom Wolfe and E.L. Doctorow, Nigerian
novelist Chinua Achebe, author and scientist Isaac Asimov, author
and historian Barbara Tuchman, Mexican author Carlos Fuentes,
British historian Paul Johnson and philosopher John Searle.

   The workers at Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co. plant have found out they can get along just fine
without bosses.
   For the past two years, the plant has been run by
``self-directed'' work groups made up of the 150 or so employees
who make industrial and automotive rubber hoses.
   It has been a successful experiment, says plant manager Robert
Becker, one that is being used at other Goodyear plants.
   ``There was just dissatisfaction with the way things were
done,'' Becker said. ``This plant used to have traditional
supervisors.''
   ``Basically it was a parent-child relationship,'' he said. ``You
know, the old `I'm the boss and you do what I say.'''
   Becker said that approach was not popular with employees,
several of whom were attending nearby Iowa Wesleyan College.
   ``I think what really happened was, as the education level and
expectations of our employees grew, the work place wasn't keeping
up with their ability to function in that work place,'' he said.
   In 1984, the company decided to launch a ``supervisorless team''
made up of ``people that all had that can-do, a little bit of
rebels, the people that were really the free spirits,'' said Becker.
   The experiment, which stresses more employee involvement in the
running of plant operations, was considered so successful that
three more work teams were formed over the next two years.
   Instead of having middle-level management positions such as
production managers and floor supervisors, each work team chooses a
``coordinator'' who brings to Becker the group's ideas and
complaints.
   ``The challenge we make to every person is: Don't ever put that
coordinator in the position of being an old supervisor,'' he said.
``You're not fulfulling your responsibility as an employee if you
put that guy in a supervisory mode.''
   The self-directed work teams may appear to mirror the way some
Japanese companies run their operations, but Becker and officials
at company headquarters in Akron, Ohio, said the idea is not the
result of Japanese philosophy.
   ``... As far as we're concerned it's an evolution of what needed
to be done in an American factory,'' Becker said. ``It had nothing
to do with the Japanese way of doing things.''
   Becker, who has been plant manager for about a year since moving
from Lincoln, Neb., said production has increased more than 40
percent since 1985. Absenteeism and accidents also have declined
during that time, he said.
   In Goodyear's headquarters, Bill Fair, director of public
relations for the company, and Mike Burns, director of organization
development, said many of the company's 48 plants in North America
are ``embracing the system in varying degrees.''
   ``We think we have a very successful system at Mount Pleasant.
It's on the leading edge of all the systems,'' said Burns. ``The
Mount Pleasant plant, overall, is considered a good plant.''
   Fair said employees at Mount Pleasant and at other Midwest
plants, such as in Hannibal, Mo., have adopted ``an entrepreneurial
attitude'' as a result of the work teams. ``They view themselves as
managing their own jobs,'' he said.
   Becker said it goes beyond that, however.
   ``We operate on the principal of trust and mutual respect. We
trust that our employees will do what is expected of them, what is
right, what is fair,'' he said.
   ``Fairness is the principal,'' said Becker. ``If you violate
that trust, we don't give second chances.''
   The system has made employees more than clock punchers working
three shifts a day, nearly seven days a week, he said.
   ``They really have a fierce sense of ownership of this plant,''
he said. ``They have a fierce sense of loyalty here in Mount
Pleasant.''

   In the third generation of the jet age, with
planes capable of flying longer and farther and airlines competing
to stay financially aloft, fatigue is a constant companion in the
cockpit. Interviews with pilots, scientists and government officals
and documents reviewed by The Associated Press show pilots are
making mistakes attributed to fatigue, mistakes that jeopardize the
lives of thousands. In the first story of a three-part series, ``6
Miles Up and Sleepy,'' AP National Writer Fred Bayles and AP
Science Writer Daniel Q. Haney examine the record of
fatigue-related mishaps.

   Airline pilots, weary from flying many hours across multiple
time zones, often wander out of assigned air space, land on wrong
runways and even fall asleep at the controls of planes carrying
hundreds of passengers.
   A review of sleep research and interviews with researchers and
pilots by The Associated Press found the significance of fatigue,
long a problem in air travel, has grown along with the deregulated
airline industry.
   Government documents obtained by the AP describe some 600
incidents over the last five years, an average of two a week, in
which air crews blamed fatigue for potentially dangerous mistakes
in navigation, communications and piloting.
   While never officially listed as a cause in any U.S. commercial
aviation accident, fatigue has been linked to several incidents. A
still unreleased report by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board cites
fatigue as a factor in the Dec. 12, 1985, crash in Gander,
Newfoundland, of a charter plane carrying 248 U.S. servicemen and a
crew of eight home for Christmas from the Middle East.
   Many people interviewed blame airline deregulation for the
mounting reports of fatigue. Deregulation brought a competitive
explosion in air travel, and pilots contend their airlines try to
lower costs by working them harder, sometimes with schedules that
keep them flying all night and into the next day.
   These work hours, say the pilots, affect their concentration.
   ``When you're fatigued, you get distracted easily. You'll miss a
radio call, or enter the wrong data or read it wrong,'' said Dave
Linsley, a United Airlines captain and a pilot's union spokesman
from New Jersey. ``Then you get into physical problems, hitting the
wrong switch, over-controlling the aircraft, sometimes turning the
wrong way or busting an altitude.
   ``It comes down to both of you sitting at the controls and
shaking your heads to stay on top of things.''
   Linsley was among two dozen pilots interviewed by the AP. Many
talked of falling asleep in the cockpit.
   ``I've flown trips that weren't safe because we were all so
exhausted,'' said a Northwest Airlines captain, who asked not to be
identified. ``I've flown trips that leave at midnight with three
legs (takeoffs and landings) and you arrive at noon, feeling like a
piece of dog meat.''
   Pilots aren't alone in their concern. Researchers such as NASA
psychologist R. Curtis Graeber believe pilots often fly beyond
their endurance.
   ``I am convinced that serious errors occur that are facilitated
by fatigue, sleep loss, jet lag, whatever you want to call it,''
said Graeber, lead scientist at the Aviation Systems Research
Branch of the NASA-Ames Research Center at Moffett Field south of
San Francisco.
   While U.S. airlines have the world's best safety record, Graeber
and others worry that pilots' schedules don't consider the
grinding, numbing effects that 15-hour days, abrupt shift changes
or multiple time zone travel can have.
   The pilots agree.
   ``Sometimes, if you've flown several legs and had a rough day
with bad weather, you realize you're not seeing things you're
supposed to see,'' said an Eastern captain who asked not to be
identified. ``I've flown at 2 in the morning when I realize I've
fallen into a hypnotic state. I've been on airplanes where I don't
remember the last three legs from the night before.''
   Fatigue contributed to at least two recent air accidents:
   _ The Newfoundland crash of the Arrow Air DC-8, taking off for
Fort Campbell, Ky. The preliminary report, as yet unreleased and
subject to modification, blames icing and crew fatigue, noting the
crew flew an exhausting schedule in the previous 12 days, including
short layovers, multiple time zones and excessive flight hours.
   The report cites a ``high potential for the development of
chronic fatigue'' among the crew and says U.S. flight-time
limitations ``do not reflect recent advances in the understanding
of the deleterious effects of fatigue.''
   _ The Feb. 19, 1985, ``inflight upset'' of a China Airlines 747
flying from Taipei to Los Angeles. National Transportation Safety
Board investigators said that after a simple engine flameout, the
crew relied too long on autopilot to adjust the plane's bearing.
When the captain finally took over, the 220-ton aircraft rolled
over into a six-mile nosedive that approached the speed of sound
before control was regained 9,500 feet above the Pacific. The plane
was extensively damaged and two people were seriously injured.
   The NTSB noted that five days before the accident, the captain
had flown through five time zones on a return from Saudi Arabia and
then had flown several flights between Taiwan and Japan. While the
report stopped short of blaming fatigue, board member John Lauber,
a sleep scientist, believes it was a factor.
   ``You go through that whole sequence and it's strongly
suggestive of a crew that weren't plugged in and who probably
weren't plugged in because of sleepiness,'' he said.
   Fatigue may have been involved in other accidents as well,
including the Sept. 25, 1978, collision between a Pacific Southwest
727 and a private plane and the Oct. 31, 1979, crash of a Western
Airlines DC-10 in Mexico City.
   On the night before the PSA accident, which killed 146 people,
the crew had barely seven hours off duty and likely slept no more
than 5{ hours. The next day, the pilot was heard saying on the
cockpit tape, ``I'm draggin'. It was a short night.''
   The Western crash occurred at 5:30 a.m. when the DC-10, having
flown about three hours from Los Angeles, landed on the wrong
runway and hit a truck. Seventy-three people died.

   Both accidents were blamed on pilot error. Experts say hard
evidence rarely exists to show pilots erred because they were tired.
   ``The problem with fatigue is it's not a bent piece of metal.
It's not a liquid that can be analyzed in the laboratory,'' said
Dr. Stanley Mohler, a former FAA official who heads aerospace
medicine at Wright State University.
   Government and airline officials acknowledge they've heard tales
of pilots napping in flight and of mistakes attributed to
sleepiness, but they play down such reports.
   ``There isn't evidence that there is a fatigue problem,'' said
Walt Coleman, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a trade
group representing the major airlines.
   T. Allan McArtor, administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, says more research is needed into the effects of
long flights on the circadian system, or biological clock. But he
denies a safety problem.
   ``There's no evidence that shows it makes flying any more
hazardous,'' McArtor said.
   Some 600 accounts of missed approaches, near misses and near
tragedies blamed on fatigue show up in voluntary pilot reports
filed with the Air Safety Reporting System, an office run by NASA
for pilots who want to confess to mistakes and report risky
conditions without fear of retribution.
   Enough reports were filed by crews for commuter airlines and air
taxis that the ASRS sent a memo to the FAA in May identifying
``recurring pilot deviations directly attributable to fatigue and
cockpit workload.''
   ``The big chunk that we have perceived out of this information
is that fatigue is a real issue that needs to be addressed,'' said
Bill Reynard, who runs the reporting system.
   Even though the reports are protected by anonymity and are not
investigated by the ASRS, Reynard believes they are truthful.
   ``It is absolutely, positively valid that these numbers are
real,'' he said. ``Our analysts have been in aviation for 20 to 30
years. They are very good at spotting a ringer.''
   The reports provide a litany of horror stories:
   _ In February 1987, the co-pilot of a cross-country jumbo jet
already descending into Boston looks up from his coffee cup to see
the captain asleep at the controls.
   ``I think we need to look at the world of the pilot and see what
more hours and labor unrest is doing,'' he writes.
   _ The next month a large airliner from Los Angeles to Baltimore
sinks 4,000 feet below its assigned altitude, coming close enough
to another plane to set off alarms at the air traffic control
center.
   ``I do not believe it would have occurred to a rested crew,''
writes a crewmember, noting he flew all night to Cleveland then
continued to Baltimore into the morning sun. ``Duty regulations ..
. do not in any way address the debilitating effects of flying all
night and especially of continuing to work into the morning hours.''
   _ Last November the co-pilot of another large jet begins a
takeoff roll from Fort Lauderdale without setting the flaps, an
error then already suspected in the Northwest DC-9 crash in Detroit
that had killed 154 people three months earlier.
   Cockpit warning horns sound and takeoff is aborted. In the
Detroit crash, the horns failed to sound.
   ``It is quite sobering to consider that the combination of
fatigue and distractions could so easily cause a breakdown in my
own cockpit discipline,'' writes the co-pilot, who had flown for
three days with little sleep.
   ``Complacency was not a factor,'' he writes. ``Simple fatigue
was the culprit.''
   That incident affords a good look at the shadowy effects of
fatigue. Planes don't crash because pilots are tired, say the
experts. Fatigue becomes a killer only when something else _
equipment or the weather _ goes wrong as well.
   If, for example, the Fort Lauderdale flight's warning horns had
failed, as they did in Detroit, the tired pilot's oversight could
have been fatal. In the Detroit crash, there was no evidence
fatigue played a role.
   On paper, FAA flight rules seem favorable to pilots. Domestic
pilots are limited to eight hours' flight time a day; overseas
pilots fly no more than 12. All pilots must get at least eight
hours of rest between flight sequences.
   However, the regulations count only scheduled flight time, not
the hours spent on the ground between flights. So scheduled
turnarounds and unscheduled delays can push a crew's day up to 16
hours.
   Scheduling agreements between airlines and pilots once kept
flight hours well below federal standards, but concessions to
management have become commonplace amid the fierce competition
brought on by deregulation.
   John Mazor, spokesman for the Airline Pilots Association, said
that 10 years ago, at the start of deregulation, the typical
contract limited flight time to a maximum of 75 to 80 hours per
month. Today, he says, it's 80-85 hours.
   Continental pilots, who lost their contract when the company
reorganized in 1983, now fly 20 percent more hours a month. The
company says its flight hours are still well under the industry
average.
   ``Our ... work rules remove the anti-productivity aspects to
allow reasonable productivity,'' said spokesman Bruce Hicks.
   Northwest pilots complain their company has interpreted
regulations to allow international crews flying home to take on
additional domestic flights, adding up to four flight hours to
their day. Northwest, citing ongoing negotiations with the pilots,
declined to comment.
   When United Airlines acquired Pan American's Pacific routes in
1986, its pilots faced extended flight hours and reduced crew size
on the longer routes. A separate contract added a day of work each
month.
   ``The Pan Am guys had a cushy job, but the company fell on hard
times,'' said John Ferg, United's director of flight operations.
``We're trying to strike a balance between what's fair and
equitable for the pilots and what's economical.''
   Many pilots interviewed complain the scales are tipped too far
toward economics at the expense of safety.
   ``I've got 400 people in that airplane and I take it very
seriously,'' said a United 747 pilot. ``It's a responsibility, and
you know this isn't good for the passengers.''

   Concern shimmered in the words of the pilot, who was writing
after spending 30 of the last 48 hours on duty, flying his commuter
plane in and out of Detroit.
   ``I found myself continuously asking the first officer if I had
performed certain duties or functions because I just couldn't
remember,'' he wrote. ``You have an accident waiting to happen.''
   The pilot's warning was among hundreds of reports detailing
pilot fatigue received by a little-known organization that monitors
safety in the nation's sky.
   The Air Safety Research System, established by the Federal
Aviation Administration and run by NASA, has collected 95,000
written reports over 12 years, ranging from admissions of missed
paperwork to confessions of near misses.
   The montage of mistakes, gripes and pointers has become an
essential tipster's sheet to problems in the air traffic system.
The information comes voluntarily from pilots who are guaranteed
anonymity and limited immunity for the mistakes they describe.
   ``Our basic function is to provide a place to which people in
the aviation system can report in confidence, without fear of
reprisal,'' said Bill Reynard, the head of the program.
   The FAA began the system in 1975 but got little response because
it offered only limited confidentiality.
   Since NASA assumed administration of the system the next year,
pilots who report errors have been promised limited immunity,
although that has been extended in less than 2 percent of the cases.
   The system goes to great lengths to protect pilots' anonymity.
The compiled reports mention no names or airlines; even the time of
day is blocked out. The place, month and year where the incident
took place are listed along with the weight class of the aircraft
involved.
   Yet the message comes through:
   The pilot of a jumbo jet bound for Tokyo from Los Angeles
confesses to flying 1,500 feet above his assigned altitude. ``We
were lucky there were no other aircraft in our area,'' he wrote,
noting his crew had flown 23 hours in three days. ``I have to
attribute it to fatigue and@or jet lag.''
   The pilot of a small jetliner reports he incorrectly decided to
continue a botched approach to Los Angeles, landing too fast nearly
halfway down the runway. ``My poor judgment was caused in major
part by fatigue,'' he wrote.
   Reynard believes the credibility of such reports. ``It's very,
very rare that somebody would make up something and then confess to
it,'' he said.
   The reports go to the ASRS office at Mountain View, Calif., for
review by analysts with aviation backgrounds. They often call the
pilots for additional information.
   If something needs immediate attention, FAA officials are
informed. Special study groups look into chronic problems such as
multiple reports of planes landing or taxiing on the wrong runways.
   The database is also tapped by investigators at the National
Transportation Safety Board. Last year, for example, after a
Northwest Airlines DC-9 crashed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport,
the NTSB requested a computer search for any reports mentioning
that airport.
   The safety system provided The Associated Press with all files
detailing instances of pilot fatigue collected since 1983. About 2
percent of all reports collected since then involve some mention of
crew fatigue.
   Reynard said analysts watch for the possiblity of false reports
filed in the often hostile environment of airline union-management
conflicts.
   ``We know when we're being campaigned by someone trying to make
a point,'' said Reynard. ``Even if they tried, our analysts are too
experienced to let something fictitious get through.

   The crash of an jetliner in Newfoundland three years ago that
killed 256 U.S. soldiers and crew members resulted in part from the
exhaustion of the flight crew, who ignored ice on the plane's
wings, according to a preliminary Canadian report.
   A still-unreleased draft report by the Canadian Aviation Safety
Board noted the crew had flown a grueling schedule in the two weeks
before the accident. Had they finished the trip, the captain would
have been awake 24 hours.
   ``I think these people were tired,'' Dr. Stanley Mohler said in
an interview with The Associated Press. ``They had been on a series
of flights prior to that, which were fatiguing. I just think they
needed a good night of sleep.''
   Mohler, head of aerospace medicine at Wright State University,
advised the Canadian board on fatigue factors in the crash.
   The plane, an Arrow Air charter, crashed Dec. 12, 1985, while
taking off from a refueling stop at Gander International Airport,
killing everyone aboard. The plane was ferrying U.S. troops from
peace-keeping duties in the Sinai peninsula to Fort Campbell in
Kentucky.
   The preliminary report lists ice on the wings of the plane as
the principal cause of the crash. But it says that a too-slow
takeoff speed and flight-crew fatigue were contributing factors.
   Spokesman James Harris said the board hopes to release a final
version of the report in early December.
   ``It may bear no similarity to the draft report,'' he said. ``In
fact, it won't. It will be quite different.''
   He said he did not know whether fatigue would still be listed as
a contributing cause.
   The draft report said that twice in the two weeks before the
crash, the crew had flown longer than allowed by U.S. regulations.
According to federal rules, no crew member may be on duty aloft for
more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period.
   If the flight had made it to Oakland, Calif., its final planned
stop, the crew would have flown about 15 hours and been on duty for
20. However, because the plane would have carried no passengers on
its final leg, this trip would not have violated federal limits.
   The board could not determine with certainty whether the pilot,
co-pilot or flight engineer were truly fatigued. However, it cited
Mohler's testimony that ``in the 12 days leading up to the
accident, the flight crew had been consistently exposed to work
patterns and fatigue-producing factors which were highly conducive
to the development of chronic fatigue.''
   These included short layovers, night departures, multiple
time-zone crossings and almost 57 hours in the air in the previous
10 days.
   In one 48-hour period that month, the crew flew for more than 22
hours, then were back in the cockpit seven hours later.
   The report said that at Gander the crew failed to notice ice on
the wings, which prevented the plane from gaining altitude after it
lifted off, and they set the wrong takeoff speed.
   ``Each of those would be consistent with tired pilots,'' Mohler
said. ``Tired pilots do things like that. They omit things. They
make mistakes.''

<TEXT>
   Backstage at the Worcester Centrum, a
few hundred yards from the hastily constructed ring where in a few
hours the Moscow Circus was to begin its first American tour in a
decade, Slava Zolkin leaned near a cage and kissed one of his 12
dancing brown bears between the eyes.
   Immediately, the other bears emitted jealous growls of protest
until Zolkin came by and stroked each one.
   ``I love them a lot and they love me,'' said Zolkin, 39, a
former tightrope artist who began teaching bears to perform after
he fell off the wire and broke his back in four places.
   Zolkin, who wears a bear keychain around his waist and hands out
bear pins to visitors, said through an interpreter that he never
uses force to train his bears to dance and juggle with their feet.
He chooses his bears as cubs and they live with him, his wife and
daughter in their three-room apartment in the Soviet Union, until
they grow too big.
   Zolkin's dedication to his bears is typical of the members of
the Moscow Circus, considered on a par with the finest theater,
opera and ballet in the Soviet Union.
   ``It's not your typical American circus; it's an art form,''
said Steven E. Leber, the U.S. producer of the Moscow Circus.
``These people have dedicated their entire lives to it.''
   Leber traveled to the Soviet Union to choose 11 of the best
circus acts from the hundreds of performers associated with the
state-run circus, a revered institution in the country.
   The first professional circus school was established in the late
1920s. Students are trained for four years in different fields and
also create their own acts. Once their act has been approved by the
Circus Board, students graduate to professional careers and are
guaranteed 20 years employment plus a full pension upon retirement.
   The Moscow Circus last performed in the United States in 1978
and just began a 15-city tour that will wind up at the Cow Palace
in San Francisco Jan. 1.
   ``These are the superstars of the circus in the Soviet Union,
the real headliners,'' said Leber.
   Included in the circus are the bears, Sumatran tigers, clowns,
jugglers, aerialists, trapeze artists and horsemen.
   One of the most spectacular acts is called ``The Flying
Cranes,'' which consists of 10 aerial artists who combine a
quadruple somersault and other daring acts with the choreography of
a ballet as their movements tell their story of the soldiers who
died in World War II, their souls becoming like those of ``cranes.''
   ``When I appear in the arena, I immediately forget about
everything else,'' said Lena Golovko, 24, who with her husband,
Vilen, is a star of ``The Flying Cranes.''
   ``Our life is in the circus where we work. But one cannot say
that it is ... that it is just work. It is our way of life. Because
all of our thoughts are with our work.''
   The ``Cranes'' had its premiere in 1985, and creator Petro
Maestrenka said it will be performed ``until we are absolutely sure
there will be peace.''
   Another notable performer and trainer is Tamerlan Nugzarov, who
oversees the 12 horses and horsemen who perform breathtaking
stunts. Nugzarov, a short, powerfully-built man with a fierce
demeanor, is from a circus family. He comes from the Caucasus
mountain range in the Soviet Union where both men and the horses
they ride are known to be fearless.
   Nugzarov and the other Cossack riders need courage. At times,
all 12 horses gallop at full speed in the ring. Sometimes the
riders are on the top of the horses, at other times they are
beneath them. Sometimes they are beside them, with their arms and
torsos dragged on the ground, both men and horses jumping through
hoops surrounded by knives.
   ``A lot of the tricks have a method to it,'' said Nugzarov,
speaking through an interpreter a few hours before the show.
``There is this myth and legend to everything we do.''
   The act is dangerous but Nugzarov said there have been few
injuries.
   ``They have not been major,'' he said. ``After all, the hardest
injuries are those to the soul.''
   Equally daunting to watch is Nikolai Pavlenko as he steps into
the cage with his 17 wild Sumatran tigers and coaxes them into
performing without ever using a whip.
   ``My attitude about my work is dictated by my attitude toward
them,'' he said. ``Animals should be allowed to show their
character. They should not be oppressed nor made to think like we
think.''

<HEAD>USDA Crop Reports Still Going Strong After 125 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This summer's searing heat and drought marked
in cruel fashion the 125th anniversary of the Agriculture
Department's first crop report on July 10, 1863.
   At the time, the Civil War was in full swing, with only a few
days elapsed since the North and South bled each other on the
fields of Gettysburg. And the USDA itself was a fledgling
department, created by President Abraham Lincoln just the year
before.
   Duane L. Jewell, secretary of the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board, the latest successor to the long-ago bureaucracy
that issued the first report, said the war put a damper on the
collection of crop and livestock information.
   Even so, he said in an interview, the first report was nine
pages and included a lengthy explanation of the need for such
material and the meaning of the tables.
   ``We had the report reprinted this year, and as far as I can
tell it's in the same format that was used then,'' Jewell said.
``Some of the information may be a little hard to understand by
today's standards.''
   For example, the original report did not include production
figures for any crop. The board's report issued on Aug. 11, 1988,
showed the corn crop at 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from
the 1987 harvest. Soybeans, which were not reported in 1863, were
estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year.
   Under the 1863 plan, monthly ``circulars'' were sent to about
2,000 farmer correspondents who voluntarily supplied USDA with the
requested information. It was decided that the government should
pay for the return postage.
   ``In the subjoined tables it will be seen that the questions
relate to but two matters, the amount sown in 1863 compared with
that in 1862, and the appearance of the crop in May and June,'' the
report said.
   Replies from some of the states were not as numerous as desired,
the report said. But the answers from ``the great grain-producing
states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa,
were full and satisfactory.''
   The report added: ``It is due, too, that the promptness of the
new and distant states of Minnesota and Kansas should be kindly
acknowledged, and their example commended to states much nearer to
the capital.''
   Among the specific items, the 1863 report noted that the winter
wheat crop in Nebraska Territory ``was destroyed by the winter, and
in New Hampshire much injured from the same cause.'' Otherwise, the
winter wheat crop looked pretty good in the 20 states, plus
Nebraska, that were surveyed.
   In 1863, there was also a familiar ring for today's corn farmers:
   ``This, our national crop, is reported as generally small in
size on account of the drought of the latter part of May and the
first half of June in some states, and nearly the whole of it in
others.''
   Although the Civil War caused little note in the 1863 crop
report _ except by the absence of information from the Confederacy
_ a portion devoted to wool took the secession into account.
   The U.S. sheep flock by the census of 1860 totaled more than
24.8 million head (compared with 10.8 million head on Jan. 1, 1988)
and wool production more than 60.5 million pounds.
   ``The rebel states produced 5,717,587 (sheep) of the whole
number, which must be deducted from it, as they are not now
represented in the wool market,'' the report said. ``Kentucky and
Missouri raised in 1862, 2,039,601 sheep, and the ravages of war
have destroyed largely these.''
   After some refiguring and allowing for projected annual
increases, the report concluded that the North may have had a sheep
flock of more than 26 million head and a wool clip of 79.4 million
pounds in 1863.
   Today, the whole realm of crop and livestock statistics is
handled by the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service, or NASS, headed by administrator Charles E. Caudill.
   The agency issues more than 300 national reports and 9,000 state
reports each year, covering more than 150 crop and livestock items.
And in times of emergency, as with this year's drought, extra
efforts are made.
   Normally, reponses from about 30,000 farmers provide much of the
information for the monthly crop reports. Field surveys and other
information are collected by the agency's 44 field offices. The
information is sent to Washington for review by specialists, who
then release final estimates through the Agricultural Statistics
Board under strict security conditions.
   In preparation for the vital Aug. 10 report, Caudill said, a
special additional survey was conducted among 16,000 farmers in 28
states to help assess the drought damage.
   Also, he said, about 1,000 corn and soybean fields are inspected
to help determine acreage and yield estimates. This year, the
sample was doubled.
   But agency officials say one thing hasn't changed from 1863: to
protect farmers and consumers from speculators.
   As the 125-year-old report put it: ``Ignorance of the state of
our crops invariably leads to speculation, in which oftentimes, the
farmer does not obtain just prices, and by which the consumer is
not benefited.''

   It doesn't seem quite right to use the word huge
when talking about a minivan, but that's the impression the 1988
Plymouth Voyager LE conveys.
   It also is comfortable, easy to drive and versatile.
   Want to take that antique table (with two leaves and four
chairs) off Aunt Ruth's hands? Pull out the two back seats of the
van and tuck the dining set inside for the trip home. No problem.
   And the furniture won't get wet or dirty, as it would in the
back of a pickup during inclement weather. Have five young
ballplayers to take to the park? Put the rear seats back in and
there's room for equipment and another adult _ and no one is
cramped.
   It's no wonder Chrysler Corp. has sold more than 1 million of
these little-big gems since the automaker pioneered the minivan
concept in the 1984 model year.
   Today, bigger automakers such as Toyota, Ford and General Motors
have joined the market, but Chrysler retains the sales lead.
Toyota's van is sold in smaller quantities and has a higher base
price for the cheapest passenger model (about $13,200 vs. about
$11,000 for a Chrysler).
   The Ford and GM downsized vans are rear-drive and a bit larger
than Chrysler's. One auto analyst has called the minivan the
product success of this decade, and some analysts predict annual
industry sales of 1 million in the next decade.
   Chrysler's idea for the minivan was to provide a fuel-thrifty
way to cart around passengers and cargo comfortably in a roomy
vehicle that would drive like a car and fit in a garage like a car.
   Chrysler has stayed true to that concept, as the test Plymouth
Voyager LE bore out. It was easy to drive and felt like a car, even
during difficult parallel parking maneuvers.
   Driving in some other, especially full-size, vans can give a
distinct bus-like feel as you turn the steering wheel and maneuver.
Getting in and out of the Voyager was uncomplicated compared with
some other vans where you have to climb up to enter and take a
flying leap to exit.
   But like other vans and unlike a car, the Voyager _ 64.4 inches
tall _ offered a good view of the road ahead. I appreciated being
able to spot potential slowdowns in traffic and parking spots in
shopping center aisles.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski noted company research shows
the low step height and low loading height are among the main
reasons for the minivans' popularity.
   Women like that, he said, adding that 37 percent of buyers are
female. Buyers' median age is 39, with median annual income of
$45,000, he said. Fifty-six percent are college graduates and as
many as 45 percent have professional-technical-managerial jobs.
   The Voyager test vehicle had superb fit and finish, inside and
out. The side door slid open easily for passenger exit.
   The rear seats were arranged so two people could sit comfortably
in the middle seat and three adults could fit in the seat behind
them. Both seats could be removed with a bit of effort after
detaching locks that held the seats to hooks in the floor.
   Be sure to check that the locks hold when replacing the seats
or, whoa, you might flip backwards. Bucket seats were in the front,
with space between them so a person could climb into the back
without going outside.
   But the van's roofline is low, so adults do have to hunch over
when moving about inside. There was some room behind the rear seat
for cargo storage, enough to stand up several grocery bags.
   If more room is needed, there's a lever to pull so the the rear
seat advances on a track. The seat back also can be folded down. In
the 1987 model year, Chrysler also introduced a longer minivan, the
Grand Voyager, which is 14 inches longer than the regular Voyager
and offers more cargo space behind the rear seat.
   Both the regular and elongated vans have a lifting rear door so
you don't have to hoist items up and over the vehicle body. I also
appreciated the rear window being all one piece. In some other
vans, such as the Chevrolet Astro, there is a pillar in the center
which reduces rear viewing.
   Also changed from the earliest Chrysler minivan models are the
engine options. The base engine for a Voyager has gone from a
2.2-liter four-cylinder powerplant to a 2.5-liter four-cylinder.
   Also offered is an optional 3-liter V-6, which boosts
performance but decreases fuel economy. The test model had the V-6
paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. The V-6 certainly
is an improvement over the standard four-cylinder, but I had to put
in 15.3 gallons of gasoline after 263 combined city-highway miles.
   That worked out to around 17-18 miles per gallon.
   There were nice touches throughout. Because the engine and
components take up much of the small hood and under-the-dash space,
Chrysler tucked the drawer-ike, locking glovebox under the
passenger-side bucket seat.
   There was a center console on the ceiling that included map
lights for driver and front-seat passenger, sunglasses storage and
a spot for garage door transmitter. In the rear, there were two
compartments for storing small items and spots to rest two cups.
   Outdoor enthusiasts who tow boats, campers, etc. will note that
Chrysler's front-drive configuration does limit towing capacity,
however. With the standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder, the Voyager can
handle up to 2,000 lbs. with the V-6 and Class II frame-mounted
trailer hitch, it can take 2,750 lbs.
   In contrast, many rear-drive vans can handle bigger loads.
   Consumer Reports says 1984-86 Plymouth Voyagers have ranked
average or above average in reports of trouble.

   On one side of the chain link fence, children play
kickball on the broken pavement, flanked by the yellow brick
buildings that have been called the worst public housing project in
the nation.
   On the other side, protected by armed security guards, rises a
social experiment _ with roots both utopian and capitalist _ where
poor residents and affluent young professionals will live in luxury
apartments and share a swimming pool, tennis courts, a health club
and a day-care center.
   The scene is the Columbia Point housing project on Boston's
Dorchester Bay, a 51-acre site that marks the first attempt to
convert a federal housing complex into private, for-profit housing.
   The transformation is not occurring without pain or upheaval,
however.
   Tenants of Columbia Point charge the private developer with
harassment, unfair evictions and reduction in some services. The
developer says the opportunity for decent housing depends on
enforcing rules.
   To some housing experts, the rebirth of the complex as a
landscaped development called ``Harbor Point'' is viewed as a test
case that, if successful, could be applied to a generation of
failed projects.
   ``There are thousands upon thousands of units in partially
occupied public housing across the country that something has to be
done with,'' said Michael A. Stegman, chairman of the Department of
City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina.
   The conversion at Columbia Point will result in far fewer
low-income apartments than in the original project, but the payoff,
he said, ``is restoring a community to livability.''
   Columbia Point rose out of an isolated city dump in 1953. In
time, violence and drug dealing scarred the complex. Squatters
occupied many vacant apartments and terrorized longtime residents.
   ``It was in a complete shambles,'' said Robert B. Whittlesey,
court-appointed overseer at Columbia Point in the 1970s. He and
Stegman said that by that time, the project was notorious across
the country.
   By 1984, the original population of 1,504 families was down to
350.
   That year, the Boston Housing Authority leased the property to
the development firm Corcoran Jennison Co. for 99 years for $1. For
those 99 years, 400 of the 1,283 apartments at Harbor Point must be
reserved for low-income tenants who will pay no more than 30
percent of their gross household income in rent. The difference
between that and market rent will be subsidized by the federal
government.
   Corcoran produced a plan to create a complex of 20 multi-family
buildings _ 10 rehabilitated Columbia Point structures, 10 new ones
_ and 214 new townhouses. Seventeen Columbia point buildings were
demolished.
   There are 1,283 units, 400 subsidized and 883 market-rate. Most
of the apartments reserved for low-income residents will go to
Columbia Point tenants, who are mainly black or Hispanic.
   Harbor Point enjoyed the backing of political leaders ranging
from Gov. Michael Dukakis to President Reagan and received hefty
state construction loans and federal tax breaks. Corcoran hopes to
net $7.7 million per year in profit.
   To succeed, the firm says it has to play hardball with drug
dealers, squatters, teen-agers who get into fights and anyone else
at Columbia Point who might make life difficult at Harbor Point.
   But many of the 320 families from the project who will make the
move to Harbor Point say Corcoran is playing too hard. They have
staged protests and even gone to court over what they call
heavy-handed tactics and aggressive security guards.
   Tenants accuse Corcoran of trying to push out poor black
families to replace them with poor whites and increase the
marketability of the apartments. An evicted tenant is subject to
arrest if he or she returns, even for a visit.
   ``This place was not geared for the black people in Columbia
Point,'' said Rose Jolly, occupant of a tiny apartment in the
complex for 16 years. ``It's not going to work the way they say
it's going to work.''
   Jolly's daughter was among several tenants evicted from Columbia
Point under the new management. Security guards falsely accused her
of dealing drugs, Mrs. Jolly said, acknowledging only that her
daughter was a drug user.
   ``My own daughter. She can't even come and visit her children.
They'll pick her up for trespassing,'' Mrs. Jolly said.
   She is among several tenants who say they have been offered
$1,000 to $4,000 by Harbor Point management to relocate and give up
their guaranteed Harbor Point housing. The money is from a federal
relocation fund.
   Nadine Wiley, Corcoran's marketing manager, denied anyone is
being pressured or bribed into leaving Columbia Point, and she
insisted the developer wants a racially and economically mixed
complex.
   This summer the first market-rate tenants began moving into
Harbor Point, drawn by advertisements emphasizing its views of
downtown Boston and touting its luxury amenities. Market-rate rents
are $675 and $1,200 per month.
   Will Harbor Point succeed in mingling Boston's poorest minority
residents with well-off, mostly white tenants?
   ``Where this thing will rise and fall is on the human side,''
said Stegman.
   He is optimistic, because of the development's choice location
and because Corcoran ``really cares about the true nature of the
partnership'' between Columbia Point residents and market-rate
tenants.
   ``It's not just a case of throwing them all in and hoping it
works,'' said Joseph Corcoran Sr., chief executive officer of
Corcoran Jennison Co., who noted a tenants task force helps make
decisions.
   Task force executive director Roger Taylor, who lived in
Columbia Point for 20 years, acknowledged that some security guards
``use their authority forcefully.''
   But the guards work in a place where, for years, there have been
no rules, he said. In answer to charges that the guards, most of
whom are white, have uttered racial slurs at tenants, Taylor, who
is black, said teen-agers in the project routinely harass the
guards.
   The stated goal of Harbor Point is to mix its varied tenants
together, but the developer acknowledged some isolation will occur.
That's because families with children are not allowed, for safety
reasons, to live in the five- to seven-story mid-rise buildings
that will have 903 apartments.
   In the mid-rises, Corcoran said, market-rate tenants will
outnumber low-income tenants about 4-to-1, because most of the
low-income tenants are families with children.
   Besides the mid-rises, most of which are new, and the 214
townhouses, there will be 166 ``garden flats'' in low-rise
rehabilitated Columbia Point buildings.
   Despite the problems, Ms. Wiley said of Harbor Point: ``People
are looking at us as a model. We're under a microscope. We feel
confident that we have the experience.''
   But Mary Ann Martorana of the Massachusetts Tenants Organization
said the Columbia Point tenants were merely ``used to get the land,
to get the loans,'' and that Corcoran is not interested in public
housing, but profit.
   ``If anyone else around the country wants to use this as a
model,'' Martorana said, ``they should have their head examined.''

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed
civil insider trading, fraud and stock manipulation charges against
the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Michael Milken,
the head of its junk bond trading unit, and others.
   In the 184-page civil complaint, filed Wednesday at U.S.
District Court in New York, the SEC said it would seek to have the
defendants surrender profits made on the affected stock trades and
pay a penalty of three times the profits. The firm and Milken
reiterated previous statements denying any wrongdoing.
   The suit capped months of speculation that the government had
assembled an extensive case against the firm as a result of the
investigation into Wall Street abuses spawned by the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal.

   Here is a chronology of major developments in
the prosecution of insider trading cases on Wall Street related to
the Ivan Boesky scandal:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information.
Levine is arrested, agrees to surrender the money, plead guilty to
criminal charges and cooperate with the government.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a record
$100 million penalty to settle charges of trading on inside
information supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to
cooperate with investigators.
   Jan. 28, 1987 _ Michael Davidoff, former head trader for Boesky,
pleads guilty to one count of securities fraud and agrees to
cooperate in the investigation.
   Feb. 11-12 _ Insider trading charges are filed against Richard
Wigton, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody & Co.; Timothy L.
Tabor, a former vice president at Kidder and Merrill Lynch & Co.;
and Robert Freeman, a partner at Goldman Sachs & Co. All plead
innocent.
   Feb. 13 _ Martin A. Siegel resigns as a managing director of
Drexel and pleads guilty to illegal stock trading and tax evasion.
He agrees to cooperate with the government and surrender $9 million
to settle civil charges that he engaged in insider trading with
Boesky.
   Feb. 20 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   March 19 _ Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of the Los Angeles
securities firm Jefferies & Co., agrees to plead guilty to two
securities fraud charges, one of which involves a relationship with
Boesky. Jefferies resigns as chairman of his company and agrees to
stay out of the securities business for five years.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to one criminal charge,
conspiracy to make false statements to the SEC, and is released
without bail as he continues to cooperate with the government's
investigation.
   May 19 _ The government drops charges against Wigton, Freeman
and Tabor, saying it needs more time to prepare its case.
Prosectors predict another indictment will be brought quickly, but
no charges have been brought since.
   June 4 _ Kidder Peabody agrees to pay $25.29 million to settle
civil charges of insider trading and an improper ``stock parking''
scheme with Boesky. The U.S. attorney's office says Kidder will not
be prosecuted.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term, and
no fine.
   Feb. 18, 1988 _ John A. Mulheren, a prominent Wall Street trader
implicated by Boesky in wrongdoing, is arrested and accused of
threatening to kill Boesky and Davidoff, the former trader for
Boesky.

psychiatric hospital. He is later released but remains under
supervision.
   March 24 _ Boesky begins serving his sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   June 7 _ Reports surface that the SEC has voted to authorize
civil charges against Drexel and its controversial junk bond
financier, Michael Milken. The government's investigation of Drexel
stems directly from information supplied by Boesky.
   July 5 _ Levine is released from a Lewisburg, Pa., federal
prison camp to serve the remainder of his term at a halfway house
in Manhattan.
   July 6 _ A federal grand jury indicts GAF Corp., its vice
chairman, James Sherwin, and two subsidiaries on charges they
manipulated the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in 1986 after a
failed attempt to acquire the company. The indictments mark the
first formal charges against a U.S. industrial company that stem
indirectly from the Boesky scandal.
   July 14 _ GAF and Sherwin plead innocent.
   Aug. 4 _ A federal grand jury indicts five partners of the
investment firm Princeton-Newport Partners and a former Drexel
official on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and mail and wire
fraud. The case, which grew out of the Boesky scandal, marks the
first time officials of a securities firm are charged with
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act. All defendants deny any wrongdoing.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC formally accuses Drexel of a range of
securities fraud violations.

<TEXT>
   A key figure in what federal prosecutors call
Wall Street's second-biggest insider trading scandal ever has
pleaded guilty to criminal charges amid indications that others may
be charged.
   Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., a 24-year-old former junior analyst
with the venerable firm Morgan Stanley & Co., pleaded guilty
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to the first criminal
charges leveled in the case.
   Wang, who was free on a $250,000 personal recognizance bond,
also agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge in connection with
a separate, previously undisclosed insider trading scheme he
allegedly undertook when he first began working for Morgan Stanley
in June 1986.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who outlined the charges at a
news conference, said Wang was cooperating with the government and
that the investigation was continuing, an indication that others
may be charged.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy set sentencing for Oct. 19. Wang
faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison and $750,000 in
fines for the three fraud counts against him.
   The charges were the first criminal counts made in the scandal
first dicslosed in late June in a civil complaint by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   Prosecutors charged Wang with using his position at Morgan
Stanley to steal market-sensitive information about pending
takeovers and other confidential matters in which the firm played a
role.
   The government alleged Wang peddled the information starting in
June 1987 to a Taiwanese businessman, Fred C. Lee, who allegedly
used it to make at least $19 million in profitable stock trades in
more than 14 companies and shared about $200,000 with Wang.
   Lee was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, but Giuliani
declined to explain why Lee was not charged. Federal officials said
Lee, also known by his Chinese name Chwan Hong Lee, was in Taiwan.
   The SEC has frozen the U.S.-based assets of both men and
requested return of the $19 million plus triple penalties for a
total of $76 million.
   That amount makes the case the second-biggest insider trading
scheme next to the record $100 million in illicit profits and
penalties surrendered by now-imprisoned Wall Street speculator Ivan
Boesky nearly two years ago.
   The Wang case is considered significant not only because of the
amount of money involved, but because the alleged abuses came at
the height of a public uproar over Wall Street greed and corruption
highlighted by the Boesky scandal. It suggested that insider
trading remains a deep-rooted problem.
   Giuliani said Morgan Stanley cooperated in the government's
investigation and faces no criminal liability, but also indicated
the firm should have done more to detect Wang's activities, which
the former analyst allegedly undertook during much of his
internship.
   Morgan Stanley spokesman Peter Roche did not return telephone
calls for comment on Wednesday. The firm fired Wang after the
scandal first was disclosed and has stated it believed adequate
precautions were taken.
   Lee's lawyer James Morton, at the Pittsburgh firm Buchanan
Ingersoll PC, said in a telephone interview that the criminal
charges against Wang were news to him. He declined to comment on
any aspect of the case or his client.
   Giuliani said the separate, previously undisclosed insider
trading scheme involving Wang included an unidentified person
living in the Chicago area, where Wang grew up. Giuliani said the
person was not a Wang relative or engaged in the financial
business, but declined to elaborate.
   In that scheme, Giuliani said, Wang fed market-sensitive tips
about developments in at least five companies to the other
individual, who used the information to make profitable trades and
rewarded Wang with about $4,000.
   Wang, who attended the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana, won a coveted internship at Morgan Stanley before
he graduated and was only days short of completing it when the SEC
brought its civil complaint.

   The principal defendants in the federal
government's long-awaited, massive insider trading suit against
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the head of its pioneering junk
bond business say they welcome the fight as a chance for
vindication.
   Ending months of speculation on Wall Street, the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a 184-page civil complaint Wednesday in
U.S. District Court accusing Drexel and Michael Milken of engaging
in a secret arrangement with convicted speculator Ivan Boesky that
included illegal insider trading, stock manipulation and fraud.
   Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick H. Joseph,
reiterated the firm's longstanding claims that it would be absolved
of the charges. Milken also again denied any wrongdoing.
   Wednesday's lawsuit capped months of guessing about whether the
government had built an extensive case against Drexel on evidence
turned up by the nearly two-year-old Boesky insider trading scandal.
   SEC charges against Drexel, with whom Boesky worked extensively,
widely had been expected since his illegal dealings were revealed
in November 1986.
   ``For the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow
trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon false
accusations,'' Milken said in a prepared statement. ``...No one
likes to be sued, but I welcome the opportunity to have at long
last a full and open hearing of the allegations in an unbiased
forum.''
   Joseph, who in July told Drexel employees to expect charges
against the firm, issued a statement saying: ``We disagree with the
charges filed by the SEC and in due course we expect to be
vindicated.''
   The SEC said it would seek to have the defendants _ three
companies and six individuals _ surrender profits made from illegal
stock trades. The lawsuit also sought from Drexel, Milken and Cary
J. Maultasch, another Drexel employee, civil penalties of three
times those profits.
   The agency offered no specific amount, but Sen. William
Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the SEC
was seeking $100 million.
   Boesky, who is serving a three-year federal prison term on an
insider-trading related charge, was forced to surrender a record
$100 million in penalties and illegal trading profits.
   Drexel and Milken allegedly had an arrangement with Boesky
involving at least 16 series of illegal securities transactions.
   Under that agreement, the SEC claimed, Boesky-controlled
companies secretly bought, sold or held securities for Drexel or
individual defendants while Drexel sometimes reciprocated with
secret transactions for Boesky.
   The SEC also alleged that Drexel and Boesky employees kept
secret, off-the-books records as part of the arrangement.
   And the SEC claimed Drexel and Milken traded in securities using
confidential information misappropriated from Drexel's own clients.
   In 1985 Drexel allegedly made $1.23 million in profits using
inside information on a pending merger between Lorimar and
Telepictures and allegedly avoided $1.78 million in losses the
following year after learning privileged information from Viacom
International about a leveraged buyout proposal.
   Federal law bars corporate executives, investment bankers and
others with access to confidential corporate information from using
it to trade in securities.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, whose office prosecuted Boesky
and other Wall Street criminals, declined to comment on whether
Drexel or any of the other defendants faced criminal charges.
   There had been speculation the SEC delayed filing its civil
complaint to avoid interfering with a criminal probe.
   In addition to Milken and Maultasch, a senior equity trader at
Drexel's New York headquarters, other defendants included Milken's
brother, Lowell J. Milken, of Los Angeles and Pamela Monzert, Santa
Monica, Calif., both Drexel employees. Drexel's parent corporation,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, also is a defendant.
   Others defendants are Florida industrialist Victor Posner,
president of Pennsylvania Engineering Corp. of Pittsburgh, which
also was named as a defendant, and Posner's son, Steven N. Posner,
a director and vice chairman of the board at Pennsylvania
Engineering. A spokeswoman, Renee Mottram, said the Posners had not
seen the complaint and could not comment.

   Former stockbroker William Dillon has pleaded
guilty to another criminal charge stemming from his admissions that
he traded securities based on advance knowledge of a stock market
column that appears in Business Week magazine.
   ``I know what I did was wrong and I'm very sorry for what I did
and for the people who were affected,'' Dillon, 34, told U.S.
District Judge John M. Walker in Manhattan when he pleaded guilty
Wednesday to a single count of wire fraud.
   Dillon, who had worked in Merrill Lynch & Co.'s New London,
Conn. branch, was the first person to face criminal charges as a
result of a federal probe into insider trading on Business Week's
``Inside Wall Street'' columns.
   Dillon, who was fired by Merrill Lynch, already has pleaded
guilty to a separate wire fraud charge in federal court in
Connecticut, under an agreement with the government.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani stated that Dillon has been
cooperating in a continuing investigation of insider trading based
on advance knowledge of securities to be mentioned in Business Week.
   Last month, federal prosecutors charged that Dillon earned
$94,000 in illicit profits on trades of approximately 129
securities as part of the scheme, in which he would buy
undistributed copies of Business Week for as little as $20 each
from a worker at a plant where the magazine was printed.
   Dillon, who faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine for each fraud count, will be sentenced March 7. He
was released on his own recognizance.
   Several stockbrokers are under investigation in connection with
the Business Week scandal and others have resigned or been
dismissed. In addition, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., Business Week's
printer, has fired or disciplined several workers.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission's mammoth
civil suit against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. marks a major
turning point in a federal crusade against Wall Street corruption
and could devastate the scrappy investment firm that pioneered
``junk-bond'' takeover financing.
   But the SEC's move against Drexel also presents great risks to
the government's case, by providing the firm with its first big
opportunity to acquit itself of wrongdoing after months of damaging
press leaks and innuendo, criminal lawyers say.
   The move also may reflect tension between the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office and SEC investigators, who have been assembling a
dossier on Drexel for months and were eager to proceed with it.
   They reportedly had been deferring action until federal
prosecutors completed a parallel probe of Drexel, a precursor to
possible felony charges. But there have been signs that the
criminal investigation is facing delays.
   Lawyers familiar with the procedure in such cases said it was
highly unusual that the SEC took action before the U.S. attorney's
office, because Drexel now has the opportunity to seek wide-ranging
access to the government's evidence and cross-examine witnesses
under civil pretrial discovery rules.
   Had Drexel faced criminal charges first, its access to the
government's evidence and prospective witnesses would be sharply
restricted and could cripple an effective defense.
   ``If I were one of the defendants in this civil case, I'd
scramble like mad to start taking discovery,'' said Michael
Feldberg, a New York defense attorney and former federal
prosecutor. ``If you're a defendant in a criminal case, the thing
you have the least of is information.''
   The SEC's 184-page civil complaint filed Wednesday against
Drexel and other defendants, notably Michael Milken, head of its
controversial high-yield bond business, alleges a variety of
systematic, fraudulent activity conducted largely in concert with
now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky. The accusations range
from insider trading to falsifying record books.
   The SEC didn't quantify Drexel's allegedly illicit profits. But
the deals mentioned in its complaint involve some of the biggest
corporate takeovers of the 1980s, in which Drexel played a
prominent financing role through its innovative use of high-risk,
high-yield securities commonly called junk bonds.
   If the SEC can prove Drexel made tens of millions of dollars in
illegal profits on those and other transactions, then the firm's
potential exposure is enormous: the SEC is seeking return of that
money plus triple the amount in damages.
   Moreover, the SEC can seek court orders kicking Drexel, Milken
or other defendants out of the securities business, a potentially
ruinous prospect for one of Wall Street's most successful firms.
   One of the SEC complaint's most intriguing elements is that it
describes a relationship in which Boesky, once thought to be a
masterful independent Wall Street financier, is little more than a
corrupt agent for Drexel.
   If true, this suggests the government's crackdown on securities
fraud is focusing more on outwardly legitimate investment banking
activities by big Wall Street firms and less on errant individuals.
   ``This is the final phase of what many people have been talking
about for the last couple of years,'' Democratic Rep. Edward
Markey, author of a proposed law to tighten penalties for insider
trading and other securities fraud, said after the SEC action was
announced. ``Boesky looked like the middleman.''
   Nevertheless, the government faces a daunting task in proving
the accusations against Drexel, which persistently has said it
would fight to vindicate itself in court and has undertaken a
massive public relations campaign in anticipation of a crisis.
   The biggest potential weakness in the government's case is
Boesky, who judging from the SEC complaint would be a star witness.
As a convicted felon, Boesky's credibility could be shattered by
Drexel's lawyers.
   ``The question is whether the trail of transactions is
sufficient for the government to believe it has enough to
corroborate Boesky,'' said Gerald Walpin, a former federal
prosecutor now at the New York firm of Rosenman & Colin. ``I'm
certain both sides have attempted that analysis.''

   Michael Milken, who faces insider
trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made
``junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporate
raiders.
   In so doing, Milken, 42, transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the
process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy.
   The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New
York against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months
of speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal.
   Although the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission had
been anticipated, Milken and others who have made fortunes in junk
bonds continued to hold their annual Beverly Hills spring gathering
known as the Predators' Ball. The message was clear: Never mind the
burgeoning government investigation of insider trading. It was
business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk
bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate
takeovers.
   Milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until
Wednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that ``for
the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow trial of
systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations.''
   In anticipation of a crisis, Drexel undertook a public-relations
campaign starting last year to polish its image, stressing the role
of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their role
in large takeover battles.
   The normally secretive and unreachable Milken himself played a
major role in that blitz, accepting speaking engagements. He
granted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be no
questions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
investigation.
   The speeches and interviews focused almost solely on Milken's
latest pet plan _ to alleviate the Latin American debt crisis by
swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those
countries' oil and silver resources.
   In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial
media wrote glowingly of Milken.
   ``A one-man revolution,'' Forbes magazine headlined one typical
article.
   ``A world-class financial wizard, on a plane with the likes of
Bernard Baruch and Jay Gould ... Mozart of the money markets,''
wrote California Business magazine.
   It had been a relatively short road for Milken, from head
cheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in
1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were among
his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry.
   Milken reportedly pulls down $40 million a year as the head of
Drexel's junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has been
estimated at more than $500 million.
   He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high school
sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former
estate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, an
upper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two miles
from his childhood home.
   Milken's fascination with finance stetches back to his boyhood.
   At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books,
Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money. A favorite pastime was
hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father, an
accountant.
   After studying business at the University of California,
Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone & Co. in Philadelphia as a
junior bond trader.
   Drexel merged with Burnham & Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels
Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and
Milken's job was moved to New York.
   Milken worked hard to make a name for himself but never got used
to the East. As the story goes, he wearied of the cold Eastern
winters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children from
playing outside. He also tired of the long commutes from his home
in suburban Philadelphia to Wall Street.
   In 1977, he pulled off a coup by convincing Drexel to let him
move the company's junk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly
Hills, just off swank Rodeo Drive.
   His reasoning was simple: He didn't have to be sitting in a tiny
office in Manhattan to make deals. He just had to know the players
and have their confidence.
   Milken was enormously successful in that regard, almost
single-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bond
investors. Milken no longer has to go on the road to make deals.
The corporate players come to him.
   Milken still works hard _ 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a
week. He once said he had no hobbies ``because what I do is fun.''
   Milken's appearance generally is described as ordinary. He buys
his suits off the rack, and it was only a couple years ago that he
traded in his unstylish American car for a Mercedes.

<TEXT>
   The proposed $2.5 billion merger of Lucky
Stores Inc. and American Stores Co. has been blocked temporarily by
a federal judge as California's attorney general fought the plan he
said would bring higher food prices to the state.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, who issued a temporary
restraining order Wednesday, said he believed the acquisition of
Lucky supermarkets by American Stores, parent of the Alpha Beta's
supermarket chain, threatens ``serious irreversible harm'' to
Californians.
   Kenyon scheduled a hearing Sept. 16 on whether to grant a
preliminary injunction sought by California Attorney General John
Van de Kamp.
   Van de Kamp, who sued to prevent the merger, says that
transaction coupled with the recent acquisition of Oakland-based
Safeway stores by El Monte-based Vons spells higher prices for
consumers.
   He said a survey he commissioned indicated the two mergers would
increase food prices by $400 million a year in California
   American has said the merger of Lucky with Alpha Beta would
lower consumer food prices by $50 million annuallyu.
   John Lillie, chairman of Lucky Stores Inc., in a statement said:
``Judge Kenyon's ruling was simply designed to maintain the status
quo until a hearing on the merits of the case can be heard. We are
confident that the court will not want to delay the combination of
Alpha Beta and Lucky Stores once we have the chance to lay out the
facts before him.''
   The Federal Trade Commission has tentatively approved the
Lucky-Alpha Beta merger, although it would require American to sell
37 markets to competing chains to maintain competition.
Nevertheless, Van de Kamp wants a trial to decide whether the
marriage of two supermarket giants is anti-competitive.
   ``The proposed acquisition threatens serious irreversible harm
to the public interest within California, which outweighs any harm
to defendants if the mergers are temporarily restrained,'' Kenyon
said in imposing the temporary restraining order.
   The judge forbade American Stores from launching a joint
operation with Lucky stores until the matter is resolved in court.
   The combination would give the Alpha Beta-Lucky chain 550 stores.
   Van de Kamp, who has threatened similar court action in the
Vons-Safeway merger, said talks are progressing on reaching an
out-of-court settlement of that dispute. He praised Kenyon's
decision on the Lucky-Alpha Beta proposal.
   American Stores did not immediately react to the developments. A
Lucky spokeswoman referred calls to American.
   In his ruling, Kenyon ordered American to refrain from selling,
transferring or closing any retail grocery stores in the areas
where both American and Lucky presently compete. The judge said
American must continue the operations of Alpha Beta independently
of Lucky stores and must refrain from supplying either with the
assets of the other or exchanging confidential business information.
   The restraining order barred American and Lucky from entering
into contracts which might hinder any future divestiture of the
Lucky assets.
   Kenyon also prohibited any change in the management team of
Lucky or of the American Stores California operation.
   American's attorney, Frank Rothman, had told the judge that the
Lucky management team was poised to take control of the joint
operation.
   In the earlier completed merger, Vons acquired 172 Safeway
stores which are in the process of being converted to Vons
operations. Vons will have 350 stores.
   American, which recently moved its headquarters from Salt Lake
City to Irvine, Calif., is one of the nation's largest supermarket
companies. Its holdings include Acme markets on the East Coast,
Skaggs Alpha Beta and Alpha Beta and Buttery in the West and the
27-state Osco drug chain.

   Biotechnology companies' product sales rose 25
percent last year, but three-quarters of the companies lost money,
according to a survey by Arthur Young & Co.
   Fifty-eight percent of the companies had lower profits this year
than last year, apparently because they were spending heavily for
the future, while 74 percent lost money, according to the survey
released Wednesday by the accounting and consulting firm.
   The companies' research and development spending rose 32
percent, outpacing revenue growth, the survey said.
   Biotechnology companies are having a hard time raising money
through stock offerings, especially since the stock market crash,
and therefore are spending the cash accumulated through past
financings in hopes of getting products to market and earning the
respect of investors, the firm stated.
   ``They expect _ and need _ to impress Wall Street again,'' the
firm said. ``The strategy is obviously risky.''
   Arthur Young concluded that the biotechnology industry is
beginning to fulfill its promise, although ``the road remains rough
in some sectors.''
   ``The general public was thinking in terms of writing the
obituary to this industry,'' said G. Steven Burrill, chairman of
Arthur Young's high technology group.
   A survey that drew responses from executives at 291 companies
found that on average they expected 32 percent of the companies to
be acquired within five years and 46 percent to be acquired within
10 years.
   The executives' estimate may be too high, Burrill said. He said
the biotech companies' close linkages with larger companies would
limit their attractiveness to other big companies that might want
to acquire them.

   If he can't teach them capitalism, at least
he'll give them heartburn.
   The man who brought American pizza to the Soviets via a roving
concession truck in Moscow now says he is working to establish the
Soviet Union's first full-fledged pizza parlor.
   Louis Piancone Sr., president of Roma Food Enterprises Inc. of
Piscataway, said Wednesday he plans to meet next week with Soviet
officials in Moscow and inspect several potential sites for a pizza
restaurant in the capital and two other cities.
   ``We are going to be looking at several locations in Moscow,
Riga and Tula,'' said Piancone.
   Piancone and his partner, Ukranian-born entrepreneur Shelley M.
Zeiger of Moorestown, entered a joint venture with Soviet officials
last year to bring the company's Astro Pizza mobile concession
truck to Moscow. The truck began selling slices of the American
fast food to tourists and Soviet customers in April.
   ``Our sales so far have been extremely lucrative,'' he said.
``This is just the next logical step.''
   To date the truck has been using ingredients purchased in Europe
and the United States because Soviet tomatoes, cheese and other
products were not readily available.
   Piancone said his trip will include a meeting with Soviet
Agriculture Ministry officials to discuss the feasibility of using
products grown locally.
   The mobile pizza parlor made a splash in Moscow when it began
operating on a snowy day in April, selling more than 1,200 slices
of the cheese-and-tomato pie in just three hours.
   Since opening, Piancone said the truck has operated three days a
week for tourists, accepting only Western currency, and three days
a week for local customers, selling slices for 1.25 rubles, roughly
just more than $2 a slice. The truck does not make rounds on the
seventh day.
   Piancone said it was always his intention, and the intention of
his Soviet partners _ who by law own 51 percent of the enterprise _
to open permanent restaurants around the country.
   He said the company is concerned that competitors may take the
initiative away if Astro Pizza Ltd. doesn't move quickly.
   PepsiCo. Inc. and Pizza Hut Restaurants earlier this year
announced their intention to open two restaurants in Moscow.
Piancone said neither has opened yet.
   But he said a Baskin Robbins ice cream parlor opened in the
lobby of a Moscow hotel. The ice cream parlor does not accept
Soviet currency, which is not readily convertible on currency
markets.
   ``I think the people in Moscow kind of resent that approach,''
Piancone said.

   The creation of a single European
market in 1992 won't undermine the national identities of the 12
member countries of the European Economic Community, an EEC chief
said Thursday.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, promised
delegates to the Trades Union Congress' annual conference that
workers' rights will be respected when the community eliminates
national trade barriers in four years.
   ``You, dear friends, will remain British. We will all maintain
our individual ways of life and our valued traditions,'' Delors
told the delegates, who represent 9.1 million workers from 85
unions affiliated with the national labor federation.
   Delors said the post-1992 single market of 320 million Europeans
will create new job opportunities and better living standards for
workers.
   Meanwhile, Delors said, the EEC will spend 40 billion pounds, or
about $70 billion, in economically deprived regions of Europe to
reverse industrial decline, fight long-term unemployment, develop
rural areas and provide jobs.
   The community's member countries are Belgium, Denmark, France,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Britian and West Germany.

   The stock market turned downward in quiet
trading today, registering a muted response to Wall Street's latest
insider trading case.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.91 to 2,061.88
in the first half hour of the session.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 274 up, 615
down and 482 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.97 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said little concerted selling was evident in the wake
of the news late Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had charged Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and several
other parties with a series of securities violations.
   For one thing, they said, it had long been known and widely
discussed on Wall Street that the investigation leading to the

   Members of the House Banking Committee today
criticized regulators' use of promissory notes to rescue insolvent
savings institutions as a ``shell game'' designed to push the
problem into the next administration.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's
3,000 savings institutions, has pledged more than $12 billion over
the last three weeks to rescue or close 48 savings institutions,
including 21 in Texas and 14 in Oklahoma, states hard hit by the
depression in the oil industry.
   However, much of the assistance has been in the form of
interest-bearing notes, which will obligate the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp. to billions of dollars in payments a year for
the next decade.
   The plan ``seems to be nothing more than a massive shell game in
which insolvent institutions are reshuffled, the names changed, and
little if any real capital injected, resulting in thinly
capitalized weak institutions,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
D-N.Y.
   ``Many of these institutions will ultimately have to be bailed
out again at even greater cost to the taxpayer,'' he said.
   Schumer said the bank board's strategy would ``postpone the day
on which the bill for this crisis becomes due until long after the
members of the current administration have left Washington and are
sitting on a beach somewhere.''
   However, Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who is asking
Congress to put the full faith and credit of the U.S. government
behind the notes, said the notes, because they are tax free and
carry a low interest rate, are the most effective way to close down
insolvent thrift institutions that are draining the industry's
health.
   Wall said his agency had $10.1 billion in the notes outstanding
at the end of August and said by the end of this month it will have
spent billions more to resolve the cases of 65 more ailing thrifts.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the committee,
was particularly critical of the $2 billion rescue earlier this
week of American Savings and Loan Association in Stockton, Calif.
   The Robert M. Bass Group, the investment arm of a Fort Worth,
Texas, billionaire, is spending $550 million and getting $2 billion
in assistance from FSLIC to acquire American. It is the
largest-ever rescue of a single savings institution.
   Part of the deal allows Bass to use $1.5 billion of American's
funds for merchant banking activities such as acquisitions of
commercial companies.
   ``Frankly, I am concerned when notes ... are utilized to promote
risky ventures such as merchant bank subsidiaries,'' St Germain
said, warning thatr, ``the industry as a whole can be expected to
take this as a green light to again reach for the riskier
operations.''
   The Bass group has been an active player in corporate takeover
battles in recent years. It is currently pushing a $1.75 billion
offer for Macmillan Inc., a publishing company. Previously, it has
participated in buyouts of Taft Broadcasting Co. and Bell & Howell
Inc.
   Wall, in a letter earlier this week to Sen. Donald W. Riegle,
D-Mich., who also had questioned the merchant banking activities,
said they are being permitted to allow the Bass group to ``capture
substantial tax benefits'' of taking over the ailing S&L.
   He noted that 75 percent of the benefits will be funneled back
to the government fund insuring S&L deposits.
   Moreover, Wall said, the agreement with Bass ``will impose
substantial restrictions, more stringent than those imposed by
(California) state law.''
   Some members of Congress fear that the slew of FSLIC notes
issued in recent weeks setting up the insurance fund for a bailout
by taxpayers, with some private analysts pegging the cost of
restoring the industry's health as high as $80 billion.
   However, the bank board says it expects to receive $42 billion
in income over the next decade and to spend only $31 billion.
   The bank board is also being criticized for agreeing to
negotiate exclusively with Bass since April 21. Before that, First
Nationwide Bank, the San Francisco-based S&L subsidiary of Ford
Motor Co., had pursued the acquisition of American for 10 months.
Its executives were upset about being shut out from making another
offer for most of this year.

   Futures prices for grain and soybeans opened
moderately lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting an
increase in farmers' sales of new-crop soybeans at levels near $9 a
bushel, analysts said.
   Soybeans for November delivery advanced to $9.05 a bushel
Wednesday before closing at $8.97. Many farmers who sign forward
contracts to sell their new-crop soybeans to grain elevators found
such levels hard to resist, said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice
president of grain futures trading with Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``Farmers haven't seen $9 beans for quite a while,'' she said.
   Ms. Leow said soybeans historically have rarely maintained the
$9 level, and she predicted prices would fluctuate within an
$8-to-$9 range until significant new export demand develops.
   The corn and soybean harvests are getting underway, which
typically has a negative impact on prices, she said.
   Some wheat futures rallied Wednesday to match the year's highs
reached earlier this summer but the market could not break through
those levels.
   In early trading today, wheat was 2 cents to 3{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.23 a bushel; corn was 3
cents to 3{ cents lower with September at $2.88{ a bushel; December
oats, the only oat contract active in early trading, was 2{ cents
lower at $2.77{ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 8{ cents lower
with September at $8.77 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with October at
71.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent lower
with September at 81.10 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with October at 38.10 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .27 cent to .75 cent lower with February at 47.35
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed higher on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Financier Bids $1.17 Billion for Utah Power & Light, Newspaper
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Ian Cumming has offered to buy a
majority interest in Utah Power & Light Co., a Salt Lake newspaper
said.
   Cumming has offered to buy 67 percent of UP&L at $30 a share _ a
$1.17 billion bid, The Salt Lake Tribune said it was told by
sources close to the negotiations.
   PacifiCorp, a diversified electric utility based in Portland,
Ore., has offered a minimum of $32.50 a share in stock for all of
UP&L's outstanding shares in a proposed merger backed by both
utilities.
   Cumming made his offer to UP&L about two weeks ago, according to
sources close to Cumming, the Utah governor's office and UP&L, the
newspaper said today. UP&L has not responded to the offer.
   UP&L declined to comment on the report.
   ``Consistent with Utah Power and Light policy, we do not comment
on rumors,'' said company spokesman Dave Mead.
   Cumming reportedly told Frank Davis, UP&L president and chief
executive officer, and Verl Topham, senior vice president, that his
offer would keep corporate control within Utah and would satisfy
federal regulators' concerns about potential antitrust problems.
   An administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission in June recommended that the commission reject UP&L's
merger with PacifiCorp on antitrust grounds. The commission is
expected to review the recommendation and issue a final decision
this month.
   Seven state regulatory commissions, including the Utah Public
Service Commission, have approved the merger.
   Cumming, who lives in Salt Lake City, is chairman and a major
shareholder in Leucadia National Corp., a New York-based holding
company with sales of $320 million in 1986. A woman who answered
his home telephone, identifying herself only as the cleaning lady,
said Cumming would be out of town until Monday. She would not say
where he could be reached.
   A secretary at Cumming's Leucadia National office in New York
said he would not be in today.
   PacifiCorp is the parent of Pacific Power & Light Co. UP&L and
PacifiCorp have promised to lower rates by 5 percent to 10 percent
within five years if the merger is approved.
   Cumming's bid, which would be subject to approval by state
regulators, is his second offer for UP&L.
   ``About a year and a half ago, Mr. Cumming hired Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. to do a price check on what UP&L stock was worth,''
The Tribune quoted one source as saying. ``Mr. Cumming increased
the price and made the offer to UP&L, but the offer was rejected.''
   How Cumming would finance his $1.17 billion bid is unknown, the
newspaper said, but in the past he has used Leucadia as a vehicle
for acquisitions.
   Leucadia has a minority interest in eight publicly owned
companies _ including a 23.6 percent interest in Prudential
Financial Services Corp., a Salt Lake City-based financial
institution.
   Leucadia also owns 39 percent of PHLCORP Inc., formerly Baldwin
United Corp., and 49 percent of BRAE Corp. Cumming is chairman of
both companies.
   In addition, he is chairman of Bolivian Power Co. The company,
which is 49.8-percent owned by PHLCORP, owns the power company that
supplies Bolivia's capital, La Paz.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee made clear today that it will be difficult, if
not impossible, to build bipartisan support for legislation
imposing new and stern economic sanctions against white-dominated
South Africa.
   And State Department officials suggested that any action on the
measure to institute an almost-total trade embargo on South Africa
and to pull out most U.S. investment might disrupt delicate ongoing
negotiations involving independence for Namibia and the withdrawal
of cuban troops from Angola.
   The committee set a vote for Wednesday on the measure as
statements from individual Republican members indicated the
legislation will not enjoy the wide bipartisan support given the
milder sanctions bill that became law over President Reagan's veto
two years ago.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a key supporter of sanctions
legislation in 1986, called the present bill ``untimely'' and told
the committee, ``There are occasions when legislation is not always
helpful.''
   ``At this moment, to go into a total disruption of our business
in South Africa does not benefit anyone,'' Lugar said, adding that
the measure would remove any leverage the United States has to
bring pressure on South Africa to end its apartheid system of
forced racial separation.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., agreed, saying she does not
believe that comprehensive sanctions will end apartheid.
   ``We simply create havoc,'' she said. ``To strike out alone with
a package that requires complete disinvestment and a total trade
embargo does not behoove us at this time.''
   Speaking for the bill, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said it is
designed to ``increase the costs of maintaining apartheid.''
   ``If we fail to focus on South Africa we will, in essence, allow
the South African regime to declare victory ...,'' Cranston said.
``We have a moral obligation to continue to press for freedom for
all South Africans.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is reportedly ready to submit up to 40
amendments designed to dilute the impact of the legislation during
its examination by the Foreign Relations panel.
   President Reagan is considered highly likely to veto new
sanctions legislation if the Senate follows the lead of the House
and approves a bill blocking most trade with South Africa and
requiring practically a complete withdrawal of U.S. business
investment.
   Cranston and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., another backer of the
harsh sanctions measure, said on Wednesday they believed the
measure could be brought to the Senate floor for a vote in the
waning days of this year's session, despite a tight legislative
schedule.
   But both said it would be difficult to pass the bill in the
absence of significant Republican support. They said opponents
could make it difficult even to get it past the Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Even if both of those hurdles were cleared, there would not be
enough support to override a veto, they said.
   But any action, even passage by the committee, would ``send a
signal to the government of South Africa that pressure is rising''
against apartheid, Simon said.
   ``I know of no other way to send that signal, other than
sanctions,'' he said.
   Simon said his recent five-day trip to South Africa convinced
him that it is time for the United States to adopt the most
punishing economic sanctions to date as a signal to Pretoria that
its apartheid policies of racial repression must be abandoned.
   ``Blacks are living in despair and hopelessness, and whites are
living in fear,'' Simon told a news conference. ``And the greater
the fear, the more there is repression.''
   ``South Africa is drifting toward massive violence and the
community of nations has to signal to South Africa that peaceful
change has got to come about,'' he said.
   The House bill, passed on Aug. 11 by a vote of 244-132, has
become a focal point of election-year politics. Many Democrats
would like to force the issue in order to portray Republicans who
oppose it as weak on civil and human rights.
   Opponents contend stronger sanctions would impose further
economic hardship on black South Africans and strengthen the
government's resolve to resist pressure for change from outside.
   A more limited sanctions measure was enacted two years ago over
Reagan's veto, an action made possible only with significant GOP
support in both chambers.

<HEAD>Postal Service Contract Subject Of Appeals Court Arguments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for billionaire Ross Perot and the
U.S. Postal Service have told a federal appeals court that Congress
never intended postal contracts to be subject to government
competitive bidding rules.
   But Perot's former company, which is challenging the attempt by
Perot and the Postal Service to do business together, disputed the
claim in arguments Wednesday before a three-judge federal panel
reviewing the case.
   Electronic Data Systems Corp., which Perot sold to General
Motors Corp. in 1986, is challenging a contract between the Postal
Service and Perot and his new company, Perot Systems Corp.
   Perot Systems Corp. won the contract without competitive bids or
notice to other companies that such a venture was envisioned.
   The contract involves Perot studying the Postal Service and
recommending efficiency steps and then sharing the savings realized
from his ideas. It is Perot's first attempt to compete directly
with his former company.
   ``This is an area where Congress has spoken often about the need
for competition,'' EDS attorney Richard Schecter told the judges.
   EDS initially lodged a protest with the federal Board of
Contract Appeals, and contended that the potentially lucrative
contract awarded to Perot conflicted with bidding rules. The
appeals board voided the contract in August.
   The federal appeals court could reinstate the contract.
   Two federal statutes were at the center of the arguments
Wednesday. One requires most government agencies to solicit
competitive bids on purchases involving computers and data
processing, and another created the Postal Service in 1970 as a
quasi-private agency.
   In creating the Postal Service, Congress freed it from federal
rules and regulations unless specified by law.
   Postal Service attorney Helene Goldberg said the Board of
Contract Appeals does not have jurisdiction over the Postal Service
and therefore lacks the authority to invalidate the Perot contract.
   Clifton Elgarten, representing Perot Systems, said Congress'
intent in creating the service was ``to free the Postal Service
from the constraints'' binding its predecessor.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Files Bribery Complaint Against Company Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Japanese parliament filed a
complaint Thursday against three businessmen for allegedly offering
him a 5 million yen bribe to end his investigation of an insider
trading case, officials said.
   Yanosuke Narazaki, of the opposition United Social Democratic
Party, filed the complaint with the Tokyo District Public
Prosecutor's Office against the current and past officials of
Recruit Co. and its subsidiary, Rescuit-Cosmos Co., a real estate
firm at the center of an insider-trading scandal, a spokeswoman for
the lawmaker said.
   According to Narazaki, one of the men, Hiroshi Matsubara, then a
top aide to Recruit's president, brought him the equivalent of
$37,000 in cash on Aug. 4, one day before the lawmaker was to take
part in the questioning of government officials about the insider
trading scandal.
   Narazaki said he declined the money.
   Recruit officials have maintained that Matsubara was acting
independently, but the lawmaker told reporters Thursday he believed
the alleged bribery attempt was carried out on behalf of Recruit.
Narazaki claims a contact number left by Matsubara was that of the
company, Kyodo News Service reported.
   The two other officials named in the complaint were former
Recruit-Cosmos Chairman Hiromasa Ezoe and Recruit-Cosmos President
Tomoyuki Ikeda, the lawmaker's secretary Aya Narazaki said.
   In a statement, Recruit said it was unaware of the contents of
the complaint, but would ``cope with the situation with a cautious
and sincere attitude.'' Company officials declined to discuss the
case further.
   The insider trading scandal surfaced in July when it was
revealed that aides to top politicians bought Rescruit-Cosmos stock
in 1984 at bargain prices before it was put on the market, and then
made hefty profits when prices soared after the stocks were
officially traded.
   Those who profited reportedly included aides to Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other top
figures in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, as well as senior
business and news media figures.

   Control Data Corp. said Thursday it is
establishing its Data Storage Products Group as a separate,
stand-alone subsidiary to be known as Imprimis Technology Inc.
   The new structure will make it easier for Control Data to form
joint ventures or partnerships in the business or sell a minority
interest in it to the public, among other alternatives, the company
said.
   The subsidiary will make products such as disk drives and tape
drives that are used to store data in large computers.
   ``This move will better enable Imprimis to compete in the
dynamic and challenging disk drive market by providing greater
flexibility in responding to its customer requirements,'' Control
Data Chairman Robert M. Price said in a prepared statement.
   ``It will also allow Imprimis to actively engage in strategic
alliances necessary to ensure its leadership and excellence in
global manufacturing and marketing of these critical components,''
Price said.
   Lawrence Perlman will head Imprimis as chairman, president and
chief executive officer, Price said. Under Perlman's leadership,
the former Data Storage Products Group achieved a significant
turnaround, Control Data said.
   Control Data, which provides computer products and services for
scientific, engineering and business applications worldwide, had
$3.4 billion in revenues in 1987.

<HEAD>EEC Warns Japan About Trade Imbalances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's
external trade commissioner warned Japan Thursday to help reduce
trade imbalances as the EEC becomes a more important market for
Japan.
   Willie De Clercq, in a speech delivered to a journalists'
conference in Berlin and distributed in Brussels, said the unified
European market may have to adopt rules to protect some industries
from excessive imports.
   However, De Clercq brushed aside fears that the EEC would become
more protectionist as it moves to set up a single internal market
by 1992 as ``totally unjustified.''
   The trade commissioner predicted that Japan's surplus with the
EEC will increase in the second half of 1988, even though it
slipped during the first half of the year.
   De Clercq, who makes such warnings to Japan on a regular basis,
repeated calls for Japan to increase imports and to give the EEC
greater access to its markets.
   He said the issue was becoming more important as the EEC becomes
a more important trading partner for Japan.
   ``The EEC is now the big, profitable, open market for Japan,''
he said.
   He noted that the creation of a single market will create
unified EEC rules on trade and this will benefit foreign companies
resident in the EEC.
   He warned at the same time that restrictions at the EEC level
may be set up in certain ``sensitive sectors'' to replace various
national restrictions which currently exist to protect some
industries.
   ``Such community measures would, of course, be discussed with
our trading partners and would have to conform fully with our

   Japan's trade surplus with the 12-nation trade bloc rose in July
to 258 billion yen, up 14 percent from the year-earlier period,
according to figures distributed Thursday by the EEC Commission.
   Calculated in dollars, the surplus rose in July by 28.5 percent
to $1.9 billion, but fell 3.2 percent in the first seven months of
1988 compared with the year-earlier period.
   The statistics showed Japanese imports from the EEC rose 16.2
percent in yen terms and by 30.7 percent in dollar terms in the
month of July. Non-ferrous metals, aircraft and textiles showed the
sharpest growth.
   Meanwhile, Japanese exports to the EEC rose 15.1 percent in yen
terms and 29.6 percent in dollar terms due primarily to increases
in exports of automobiles, office machinery and audio-visual
equipment.

   Share prices closed lower Thursday on the London
Stock Exchange, as the market fretted again over the direction of
domestic interest rates and the overall health of the British
economy.
   By the end of the trading session, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was down 16.3 points, or 0.9 percent, at
1,739.8.
   The index plunged just before midday as much as 27.5 points.
   Volume was 412.5 million shares, up from 310.1 million traded on
Wednesday.
   ``Let's just say it's been a very unsettling day,'' one equity
salesman said.
   Market watchers said additional pressure was placed on share
prices by a cautious survey on the domestic economy from the
Confederation of British Industry and a wobbly start on Wall Street.
   Some dealers said the London market came unhinged when the
British pound turned lower, sparking fears that domestic interest
rates will be pushed higher.

<HEAD>SEC's Portrayal of Boesky as Drexel Agent Gets Skeptical Response</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A theme underlying the government's
unprecedented civil enforcement action against Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. is that the investment firm used convicted insider
trader Ivan F. Boesky as a stooge for cheating and illegal
profiteering.
   But some securities lawyers find that idea flawed.
   More likely, they say, is that Boesky and Drexel had a mutually
beneficial relationship, assuming the accusations leveled by the
Securities and Exchange Commission are accurate.
   ``Frankly, I'm very skeptical that Drexel was the manipulator
behind the scenes of Ivan Boesky,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a
partner in the New York law firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
and a member of the Securities Industry Association's trading
practices committee.
   ``It's true in the securities market generally that people work
together in all kinds of ways. Transactions are seldom isolated to
one participant,'' he said. ``So it's possible that Boesky could be
an agent technically for some purpose in dealing with Drexel, but
I'd say the converse is equally likely. That fact doesn't lead me
to conclude Drexel was a puppeteer in this role.''
   The SEC's mammoth enforcement action, undertaken Wednesday after
an investigation that lasted ne Other controversial House amendments would:
deny student loans
and other federal benefits to convicted drug users, admit illegally
seized evidence in court if police acted in ``good faith'' during a
search, and withhold federal highway money from states that refuse
to revoke or suspend drivers' licenses of convicted drug users.
   As the House conducted a generally mild-mannered debate on the
375-page bill Wednesday, policemen-turned-lobbyists roamed through
lawmakers' offices to present their views on a seven-day waiting
period for handgun purchasers.
   They were not all on the same side in debating this provision of
the drug bill, which includes an optional background check on the
purchaser during the week-long delay.
   Rank-and-file officers supporting the waiting period are part of
a coalition of law enforcement organizations and gun control
groups. The coalition has set up shop in a House Judiciary
Committee basement hearing room in the Rayburn Office Building
across the street from the Capitol.
   Other policemen are lobbying for the National Rifle Association,
which opposes the waiting period and virtually any form of gun
control that affects the general population.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., will try to eliminate the waiting
period. His amendment would substitute an identification system
that would allow gun dealers to check by telephone or other means
to determine whether a purchaser is a convicted felon.
   The Gekas proposal on the death penalty would permit _ but not
require _ a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted
of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony.
   If the death penalty was not imposed, the amendment would
require a sentence of 20 years to life.
   The Senate legislation that passed last June would permit the
death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug
crimes; and for drug ``kingpins,'' defined under law as those who
supervise five or more people, commit at least three federal drug
felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   The only brief moment of emotion during the opening debate
Wednesday came when Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., urged the House
not to ``stoop as low as those killers in the street'' by approving
the death penalty. He said it would be ``beneath the dignity of
this House'' to approve the Gekas language.
   But McCollum rose to Gekas' defense, calling the death penalty
``the missing deterrence'' in the fight against illegal drugs.
   Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable
because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into
compliance with Supreme Court guidelines on capital punishment.
   The overall anti-drug bill provides for money and programs that
would attack drug use from every conceivable direction.
   The legislation would increase spending for federal and state
law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land, in the
air and on the seas.
   Banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of
drug money at legitimate financial institutions. Education programs
would be expanded for youth, including disadvantaged youngsters and
the most hardened gang members. Capacity would be increased, and
waiting periods lessened, for entry into drug rehabilitation
programs.
   The bill encourages Latin American countries to form a regional
anti-narcotics force and pledges financial support if one is
started.
   Federal contractors would be required to maintain a drug-free
workplace. Tight controls would be placed on the U.S.-made
chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin, cocaine and other
drugs.
   States also would be given money to develop programs to stop the
spread of AIDS by intravenous drug abusers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marriott Corp. will spend $1 billion over
the next five years to expand its extended-stay lodging centers,
company officials announced Thursday.
   Marriott plans to build 300 Residence Inns nationwide, with most
of the units scheduled for construction in the Northeast, Midwest,
and West.
   Marriott already has 123 Residence Inns, which feature
moderately-priced, all-suite accommodations geared to customers
staying in hotels for five or more nights at a time.
   The new units are scheduled for completion by the early 1990s,
company officials said.
   ``The extended stay traveler who is on the road much of the time
is looking for a place that looks and feels like home,'' said David
H. Rolson, executive vice president and general manager of
Marriott's Residence Inn division.
   Extended-stay travelers now account for more than 50 percent of
the Residence Inn division's business, which Marriott officials
estimate to be more than 7 million customers per year, who average
10 nights or longer per stay.
   Residence Inns are built in a two-story residential style and
include either one or two-bedroom suites. Each comes with complete
kitchens, and many include fireplaces. Swimming pools, health spas
and exercise clubs are also available to lodgers.

   Soybean futures closed strongly higher Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to new drought-damage
estimates while wheat declined and corn was narrowly mixed.
   The crop production estimates of about 30 trading companies
averaged 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans and 4.2 billion bushels of
corn. Those compare with last year's production of 1.9 billion
bushels of soybeans and 7.1 billion bushels of corn.

soybeans and 41 percent for corn compare with the Agriculture

soybean crop and a 37 percent drop in corn production.
   Strength in the soybean meal market added to the soybean rally,
said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital

   Wheat declined in reaction to the USDA's rejection of various
offers for export sales, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 6{ cents lower with the

<HEAD>Weinberger Named Publisher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
was named publisher of Forbes magazine, effective Jan. 1, Forbes
chairman Malcolm S. Forbes announced Thursday.
   Weinberger, 71, who resigned from the Reagan administration last
November after nearly seven years in his post, has limited
experience in publishing. He was president of the Harvard Crimson
as an undergraduate, and has worked as a newspaper columnist and
television moderator.
   ``This promises to be a lot of fun for a while,'' Weinberger
said at a ceremony at Forbes' Fifth Avenue headquarters.
Weinberger, who called journalism his ``first love,'' will be
writing commentary in every issue.
   ``The kind of advice that he used to receive, he will now be
giving,'' Forbes said. ``He brings a dimension of knowledge of
American business and the operations of government. It's a unique
combination.''
   He replaces James J. Dunn, 69, publisher since 1966. Dunn _ only
the third publisher in the magazine's 71-year history and the first
who was not a member of the Forbes family _ will become vice
chairman and consultant to the magazine.
   Dunn said his decision to step down was personal.
   ``Some years ago Malcolm said to me, `You know Jim, you and I
are going to go out feet first','' Dunn said. ``I decided against
feet first.''
   The previous publishers were Malcolm Forbes and his father, B.C.
Forbes, the magazine's founder.
   The biweekly magazine has a circulation of 735,000.
   ``My four Forbes-involved sons and I are really happy that Cap
Weinberger is going to be helping us and our colleagues at the
wheel of Forbes,'' said Forbes, who is the magazine's
editor-in-chief.
   Weinberger said he did not plan to move to New York from
Washington. He maintains an apartment here.
   When asked what his salary as publisher would be, Weinberger
practically gloated: ``I don't know that it's a matter of public
interest. It's the kind of question I had to answer in public
office and I don't have to answer it here.''

<HEAD>DOE Picks Westinghouse To Run Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy announced Thursday it
has awarded a $6.7 billion contract to the Westinghouse Electric
Corp. to operate the Savannah River Plant, a nuclear weapons
facility in South Carolina, for 5{ years beginning next spring.
   Westinghouse, which beat out Martin Marietta Corp. for the
contract, will replace the Du Pont Co. as operator of the plant. Du
Pont, which built the plant and operated it for more than 30 years,
announced last fall it would not renew its contract when it expires
next April.
   Joseph Salgado, acting deputy energy secretary, said both
Westinghouse and Martin Marietta offered ``high-caliber proposals''
for the operating and management of the plant.
   ``The selection process resulted in the choice of the single
proposer which I believe will operate SRP in the best interest of
this nation,'' Salgado said. ``Westinghouse has considerable
experience in operating national defense facilities for the
department.''
   Westinghouse, which currently operates six Department of Energy
nuclear facilities, will begin operations at the Savannah River
Plant on Nov. 1, working alongside Du Pont officials during a
five-month transition period.
   Du Pont employees currently working at the plant will be
guaranteed continued employment with Westinghouse under terms of
the contract, according to DOE spokeswoman Chris Sankey.
   ``We are extremely excited and very pleased at our selection,''
said John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer of
Westinghouse. ``We are committed to total quality of all phases of
operation at the Savannah River Plant.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the selection of Westinghouse ``and a timely
transition will help to ensure that operations at Savannah River
are conducted in a safe and efficient manner.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said Westinghouse officials have
assured him that they will operate the plant ``with the highest
level of quality and productivity'' and will comply with all
``state-of-the-art environmental practices.
   ``In addition, Westinghouse has agreed to work for an
improvement in the quality of life in the surrounding communities
and to use the university structure in the state to assist in
research and development at the Savannah River Plant,'' Thurmond
said.
   Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., whose district includes the giant
plant near Aiken, S.C., and the Georgia border, said he was
``tremendously impressed'' with Westinghouse officials during
meetings prior to the awarding of the contract.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind about their commitment to the
safe operation of SRP and their ability to ensure that local
citizens and the environment are not harmed by SRP operations,''
Derrick said.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington last month recommended the
Savannah River Plant as the site for construction of a new
``state-of-the-art'' nuclear reactor to produce all the tritium
needed for the nation's nuclear weapons program. He also
recommended constructon of a smaller nuclear reactor to produce
weapons materials in Idaho.
   The new reactors eventually would replace three aging reactors
at SRP and one at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington
state. The three SRP reactors all currently are shut down for
maintenance or safety reasons, and the Hanford reactor was placed
on ``cold standby'' earlier this year.
   Westinghouse has submitted a proposal to DOE to design and build
the new production reactor at SRP, but Ms. Sankey, the DOE
spokeswoman, said the award of a contract for that project probably
won't occur before next spring at the earliest.

   Assets of the nation's 452 money market mutual
funds fell $239.9 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $266.93 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $2.01 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds fell $172.2 million to $84.98
billion, assets of 103 broker-dealer funds increased $36.3 million
to $113.22 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds declined
$104 million to $68.73 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.37 percent from 7.27 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.23 percent from 7.14
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
33 days, the same as in the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.97 percent as of Wednesday from 5.94 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.12 percent, the same as during the previous
week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.68
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.64 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.98 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
7.96 percent; 8.25 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.23 percent;
and 8.55 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.54 percent.

   In a $333 million deal believed to be Atlanta's
largest real estate sale, architect and developer John Portman said
Thursday he has bought out the investors in his Peachtree Center
complex, giving him ownership of the project he began piecemeal 27
years ago.
   Portman, who already owned about half of the complex of six
office buildings, two parking decks and a retail mall, said, ``We
have now the potential to go forward much more rapidly'' on other
downtown projects.
   The developer also has projects in New York, Los Angeles,
Detroit, San Francisco, Shanghai and Singapore.
   The Peachtree sale is being financed by Equitable Real Estate
Investment Management Inc., the Atlanta-based subsidiary of
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. Under terms
of the mortgage, Equitable Real Estate Chairman George R. Puskar
said, the company would receive a portion of the revenue from
Peachtree Center as well as an option in 10 years to become half
owner of the project.
   The sale comes at a time when many downtown Atlanta trophy
properties are the objects of investors, mainly foreign, looking to
acquire high-profile real estate.
   In a deal yet to be closed, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. of Japan
is negotiating to buy the IBM Tower, Atlanta's newest showpiece
skyscraper, for $300 million.
   Other major downtown office properties, including
Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s headquarters tower and Ted Turner's CNN
Center, are known to be for sale.
   Peachtree Center has become the center of downtown Atlanta since
Portman first began putting it together in 1961 with the beginning
of the Atlanta Merchandise Mart, which has been expanded several
times. The Atlanta Market Center now covers 6.2 million square feet.
   The six Peachtree Center office towers account for 2.3 million
square feet of prime office space, 22 percent of the downtown
total. Portman earlier this year also announced the construction of
a seventh tower, a 60-story, $300 million building. A major tenant
for that building has yet to be announced.
   The towers and underground shopping mall are connected via
numerous overhead walkways to the Market Center and three
Portman-designed hotels _ Westin Peachtree Plaza and Marriott
Marquis, in which he maintains an ownership interest, and the Hyatt
Regency.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range
Thursday, showing few shock effects from the latest developments in
Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.67 to 2,063.12.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
765 up, 677 down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.38 million
shares, up from 139.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 174.91 million shares.
   Analysts said no concerted selling appeared in the wake of the
news late Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had
charged Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and several other parties with
a series of securities violations.
   For one thing, they said, it had long been known and widely
discussed on Wall Street that the investigation leading to the
allegations was under way.
   However, brokers added, it was evident that the market was still
suffering from apathy and caution about the outlook for the economy
and interest rates.
   Some observers have said they were disappointed that the market
has shown little follow-through this week toord of a $10-a-share
bid for the company by a concern controlled by the Pritzker family
of Chicago.
   Browning-Ferris Industries rose { to 27. On Wednesday the
company named William Ruckelshaus, former head of the Environment
Protection Agency, as its chairman and chief executive.
   Among the blue chips, Philip Morris rose ~ to 96} and
International Business Machines added ] to 112[, while Exxon dipped
[ to 45| and General Motors lost [ to 73|.
   Financial Corp. of America plunged | to [, for an 83 percent
drop. The company, whose American Savings & Loan Association is
slated to be taken over in a government-assisted transaction, has
been authorized by its directors to file a petition under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.20 billion, or .12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .08 to 150.46.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index lost .05 to 304.67, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .01 at 265.88.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.77 to 379.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 297.00, up .64.

<HEAD>Textile Workers Ratify New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cutters and stitchers of men's clothing ratified
an 18-month contract with major manufacturers that calls for wage
increases and improved health benefits, the Amalgamated Clothing
and Textile Workers Union announced Thursday.
   More than two-thirds of the 15,000 workers covered by the pact
voted in favor of it, according to Jack Sheinkman, ACTWU president.
   The manufacturers, members of the Cotton Garment Allied
Industries Fund, include several big-name makers of men's shirts
and pants including Arrow, Gant and Hathaway and operate factories
throughout the South and Northeast.
   The new contract runs until Feb. 28, 1990, and provides for a
25-cent hourly wage increase in the first year, which is a 4.3
percent increase over the current industry average, and a 15-cent
raise on Sept. 1, 1989.
   Cutters and sewers of men's and boy's shirts and men's sleepwear
currently earn an average of $5.54 an hour, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. The bureau has no wage figures for pants
makers.
   The pact also includes some innovations including a six-week
unpaid parental leave clause, a joint union-employer safety and
health committee to be established at each plant and a special
child care committee to explore establishing child care facilities
wherever feasible.
   The contract is expected to form the basis for other contracts
covering another 27,000 workers whose contracts expire later this
year, Sheinkman said.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move in Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Aug. 29, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,033.6 billion in the week ended Aug. 29 from $3,034.1
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,849.1 billion from $3,846.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $782.6 billion from a revised $783.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $568 million in
the week ended Aug. 31, compared with a decline of $1.118 billion a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings averaged
$577 million a day in the week ended Sept. 7, down from $645
million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $281.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $281.9 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>AT&T To Cut Up to 6,000 Jobs In Network Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. plans to cut
about 6,000 jobs in two years from its Network Operations Group and
expects to reduce employment elsewhere in the company as well, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   The cuts in the Network Operations Group, which runs the
long-distance network, will amount to about 8 percent of the unit's
74,000 employees, spokesman Burke Stinson said.
   He said the total cuts could exceed 6,000. The company will try
to achieve as many of the cuts as possible through voluntary
retirements, resignations and reassignments to other parts of the
company, but will not rule out layoffs, Stinson said.
   ``Virtually every organization in AT&T has the marching orders
to reduce the number of non-sales-related jobs. This is the most
specific and is the earliest,'' he said.
   AT&T's total employment has risen by about 12,000 this year to
about 315,000 after having dropped steadily since the 1984
divestiture of the local operating companies. The increase has
alarmed Chairman Robert E. Allen, who announced in July the first
companywide hiring freeze since the Bell System breakup.
   Some of the people being cut from Network Operations will be
among the 3,000 people whom AT&T is reassigning from staff jobs in
various parts of the company to jobs in sales, marketing and
customer support, Stinson said.
   Network Operations does not include operators. Most of the jobs
are for supervisors and managers of the long-distance network, and
Stinson said the computerization of the network has reduced the
need for staff.

<HEAD>Dollar Advances Against Most Major Currencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced slightly against most major
currencies Thursday after trading in a narrow range while the
market awaited fresh news on the economy.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $428.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $427.50
late Wednesday.
   Currency analysts said there was little news to stir the markets
after last week's higher unemployment figures sent the dollar
tumbling.
   ``Most of the market is on the sidelines waiting for the PPIs
tomorrow and the trades on Wednesday,'' said Ted Wolicki, a trader
with Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago. ``I
don't think much will happen until they come out.''
   The Labor Department is scheduled to release statistics Friday
on the Producer Price Index for August, which measures wholesale
prices and is an important indicator of inflation. Next Wednesday,
the Commerce Department will release numbers on the U.S. trade
deficit for July.
   ``The biggest thing the market is looking for are the trade
figures,'' said George Palfi, vice president of foreign exchange
marketing for First Capital Corp. of Chicago. ``As they go, the
dollar will go.''
   Analysts said the dollar tried to move higher Thursday but then
reacted negatively to a Commerce Department statement that a rise
in the U.S. currency would be counterproductive to the U.S. economy.
   The market also reacted negatively to later statements at a
foreign exchange conference in New York that the dollar was headed
downward, analysts said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 134.20 Japanese yen from
134.30 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it slipped to
133.75 yen.
   The dollar reversed its slide against the Japanese yen in New
York trading, closing at 133.625 yen, compared with 133.325 late
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6940 from $1.7060 late
Wednesday. Later, in New Yorkthe pound cost $1.7000, compared with
$1.7080 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Wednesday included: 1.84625 West German marks, up from 1.84125;
1.5571 Swiss francs, up from 1.5530; 1.23975 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.23755; 6.2865 French francs, up from 6.2760; and 1,383.00
Italian lire, up from 1,377.375.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8485 West German marks, up from
1.8435; 1.5600 Swiss francs, up from 1.5545; 6.3025 French francs,
up from 6.2795; 2.0855 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0810; 1,384.50
Italian lire, up from 1,376.50; and 1.2395 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2392.
   Several large buy orders boosted gold bullion, but trading
activity remained limited, dealers said.
   In London, the metal rose to a late bid price of $428, up from
$426.70 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, it rose to $428.50 from
$427.50 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at
$430.51, up from $430.19 bid at Wednesday's close.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold also closed up at
$428.80 a troy ounce, compared with $428.10 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $6.58 a troy
ounce, up from $6.52 bid late Wednesday.
   On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery rose to
$6.612 a troy ounce, from Wednesday's $6.546.

<HEAD>Speculators Push Soybean Futures To 7{-Week High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices registered their highest daily close
since mid-July Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade after new
drought-damage estimates sparked a speculative rally.
   Wheat finished lower and corn futures were mixed.
   On other markets, energy, precious-metals and cocoa futures
gained while livestock, meat and stock-index futures declined.
   The Agriculture Department won't release new crop production
estimates until Monday afternoon. But private predictions issued
Thursday indicate most analysts expect the USDA to again lower its
estimates for the 1988 corn and soybean harvests.
   The estimates of about 30 trading companies averaged 1.4 billion
bushels of soybeans, 25 percent less than last year's production of
1.9 billion bushels, and 4.2 billion bushels of corn, a 41 percent
decline from last year's 7.1 billion bushels.
   The USDA had estimated declines of 23 percent for soybeans and
37 percent for corn in its August crop production report.
   Speculators gave the soybean market its initial push, then
technical traders turned buyers based on the improved chart
signals, analysts said.
   Soybeans for November delivery, the first month for the new-crop
beans, finished at $9.05{ a bushel, the highest close for that
contract since it settled at $9.27 on July 18.
   ``It was a pretty impressive day,'' said Mario Balletto, soybean
analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   Balletto said the strong soybean meal market provided additional
support.
   ``The meal market is very bullish,'' he said. ``Prices are still
too low and that's certainly spilling over.''
   The wheat market ended a 6-day rally, settling lower on
disappointment over slow export sales and reports the Soviet Union
was negotiating a large purchase of European wheat and barley,
analysts said.
   ``We're not the only ones they're buying from and that's kind of
negative,'' said Jerry Gidel, grain analyst in Chicago with the
G.H. Miller division of LIT American Inc.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 5{ cents lower with September at
$4.06{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to } cent higher with
September at $2.90{ a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3 cents lower
with September at $2.66{ a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 15
cents higher with September at $8.89{ a bushel.
   Oil futures prices rebounded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after five straight days of declines that had left them at their
lowest point in nearly two years.
   Analysts said the increase was partly technical in nature and
partly caused by a reassessment of the intentions of Saudi Arabia.
   Prices had been knocked down this week by rumors that the Saudis
were offering volume discounts to Japan. But stories Thursday
contradicted those rumors and said any price cuts the Saudis
offered to the Japanese would not be mirrored by price cuts
elsewhere, said Bob Baker, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 32 cents
higher with October at $14.48 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to
.43 cent higher with October at 41.87 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .25 cent lower to .40 cent higher with October at
42.99 cents a gallon.
   The advance in the oil market helped to boost the
inflation-sensitive precious metals futures, with platinum leading
the way.
   Platinum settled $9.60 to $10.10 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with October at $537.50 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was 60 cents to 70 cents
higher with October at $430.80 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to
7.2 cents higher with September at $6.612 a troy ounce.
   The battered cocoa market rebounded on reports that discussions
between producer and consumer nation-members of the International
Cocoa Organization were centering on ways to support prices. Some
analysts had expected the two-week meeting in London to accomplish
nothing except to hasten the demise of the price-stabilization
group.
   Cocoa settled $28 to $46 higher with September at $1,219 a
metric ton.
   Cattle futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in response to denials of Wednesday's rumor that a large
Iowa meatpacker had signed a long-term agreeement to supply beef to
Japan, said Charles Richardson, livestock market analyst in Denver
with Lind Waldock & Co.
   Pork futures retreated in sympathy with cattle, he said.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent to 1.27 cents lower with October at
70.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.37 cents
lower with September at 80.70 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to
.47 cent lower with October at 38.10 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .62 cent to 1.03 cents lower with February at 47.07
cents a pound.
   Stock index futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The contract for September delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index was unchanged at 266.10 points.

<HEAD>Hyatt Makes $397 Million Offer for Ramada Inc.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hyatt Corp. offered Thursday to buy rival
hotelier Ramada Inc. for an estimated $397 million.
   Ramada officials were noncommittal after Hyatt announced its
bid, but investors reacted enthusiastically to the offer, bidding
Ramada stock up $2.12{ a share to $9.75 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   Hyatt chief Jay Pritzker made the offer in a letter to Ramada
chairman Richard Snell, Hyatt spokeswoman Karen Rugen said.
   ``We have believed for some time that an affiliation of our
companies would be mutually beneficial,'' Pritzker's letter said.
   Spokesman Joe Cole said the Ramada board would meet to discuss
the offer before the close of business next Friday, the deadline
set by Pritzker in his letter.
   Pritzker's letter said the proposal would expire ``if you have
not indicated a sincere desire on or before'' the deadline set.
   ``Should you choose not to commence a dialogue with us or should
market conditions warrant, we may take unilateral action to
increase our stake in the company or to dispose of any or all or
any part thereof.''
   Neither Cole nor Ms. Rugen could comment beyond company
statements when asked whether the offer was considered hostile.
   Hyatt offered to pay $10 for each of Ramada's 39.7 million
outstanding shares, or a total of $397 million.
   HCC Corp., a Hyatt affiliate, already holds 2.8 million shares,
or 7.2 percent, of Ramada stock, Ms. Rugen said.
   Cole said it has been known for some time that the Pritzker
family, which founded the closely-held Hyatt, has been interested
in Ramada.
   ``The last conversation before this offer (was in) March of this
year,'' he said. At that time, Ramada officials told Hyatt
officials they were not interested, Cole said.
   Pritzker's letter said Hyatt had cash on hand for the
transaction.
   ``Our proposal to acquire all of the equity of the company is
not conditioned upon financing and we have available sufficient
funds to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,''
Pritzker wrote.
   Ramada companies operate 800 hotels, mostly moderately priced,
in 40 countries. They include Ramada Inns, Rodeway motels and the
upscale Ramada Rennaissance hotels. Ramada also owns 135
restaurants in the Marie Callender's chain, Cole said.
   In 1987, the company had revenue of $226.6 million from hotels,
$406.8 million from gaming operations and $113.1 million from
restaurants, Cole said.
   Hyatt subsidiaries, all owned by the Pritzker family, operate
144 luxury hotels in many major cities worldwide, Ms. Rugen said.
   Hyatt in 1985 announced plans to build 40 hotels by late 1990 in
areas outside the the major cities which had formed the base of its
business.
   Ms. Rugen would not comment Thursday when asked if the proposed
acquisition of Ramada was linked to that plan.

   Thousands of Chicago commuters were spared a
morning ``rush-hour nightmare'' when the Chicago & North Western
railway and one of its unions agreed Thurssday to delay a likely
strike.
   ``Both sides agree that this is a step that is in the best
interest of commuters,'' 41,000 of whom use C&NW commuter trains
serving the Chicago area, said David Carle, a spokesman for U.S.
Sen Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   The 2,600 members of the United Transportation Union at the
railroad had planned to walk off their jobs at 12:01 a.m. CDT
Friday, when a 36-day cooling-off period ends and the Chicago &
North Western Transportation Co. had planned to lay off 1,150 of
the 2,300 union brakemen in its 10-state freight operation.
   The Senate late Thursday gave unanimous approval to Simon's bill
implementing recommendations of a presidential emergency board,
which in July called for trimming 689 brakemen.
   President Reagan appointed the panel in April to study the labor
dispute and seek a solution.
   Simon predicted the measure would sail through the House on
Friday and win quick approval from Reagan. He said the bill could
be passed by late morning and signed an hour or so later by the
president.
   Under the Railway Labor act, Congress and the president have
specific authority to settle railroad disputes that threaten
national commerce.
   The railroad and the union have been battling for more than a
year over the size of train crews on C&NW freight trains.
   The company contends the brakemen's jobs are obsolete and that
trains can be run with a two- or three-man crew _ an engineer, a
conductor and, in some cases, a fireman.
   The union contends the brakemen _ two on each train's crew _ are
necessary to maintain railroad safety.
   The two sides have failed to reach a compromise and earlier this
week had implemented strike plans.
   Don Markgraf, UTU general chairman, said he opposes federal
intervention, but that the union would honor the settlement if it
is approved by Congress.
   The railroad expects Congress to push through the legislation,
said C&NW spokesman James Foote, but he noted that management
personnel had been deployed throughout the freight system and about
8,000 replacement workers had been recalled.
   C&NW commuters also were bracing for a walkout _ the third
threatened this year.
   The UTU struck C&NW for about four hours Aug. 4, after an
earlier cooling-off period imposed by President Reagan. During that
period, the special presidential board proposed a compromise to end
the impasse.
   Both sides then rejected the proposal _ the one now going before
Congress _ setting the stage for the August strike.
   Congress, however, ended that strike quickly by imposing a
second cooling-off period.

<HEAD>Utah Financier Makes Offer For UP&L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utah financier Ian Cumming has made a $1.2
billion cash bid for a majority interest in Utah Power & Light Co.,
an offer that is about $600 million less than one made a year ago
by Oregon-based Pacificorp and accepted by UP&L.
   UP&L spokesman Dave Mead said the privately held utility, which
is in the process of trying to gain regulatory approval for a
merger with Pacificorp, has not responded to Cumming's offer. He
said the company had no further comment.
   Cumming, who lives in Salt Lake and is chairman of Leucadia
National Corp., a New York-based holding company with sales of $320
million in 1986, could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman
who answered the phone at Cumming's home said he was not expected
home until Monday.
   His New York office referred calls to a Salt Lake attorney,
Stephen D. Swindle.
   Swindle said Cumming made the offer through a letter to UP&L
directors in June. The lawyer confirmed the bid is a cash offer of
$30 per share for at least 67 percent of UP&L stock, totaling $1.2
billion. Swindle said it would be premature to discuss how the
acquisition would be financed.
   UP&L stock closed at $30.12{ a share in New York Stock Exchange
trading Thursday, up 25 cents.
   Cumming and Leucadia have expressed concern that a merger with
Pacificorp would not be in the best interest of the state, or
UP&L's customers and shareholders, Swindle said.
   ``UP&L has historically played an important role in the state
and should remain a free-standing company, based in Salt Lake City,
and not part of a regional power company,'' Swindle said.
   Under terms of the Pacificorp merger, UP&L would become a
division of Pacificorp and be part of an $8 billion system serving
seven western states.
   Utility commissions in all those states, including Utah, have
approved the merger, but it has since been stalled at the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.C. A FERC
administrative law judge has recommended the commission deny the
merger because of possible anti-competitive impact.
   The FERC is expected to make its final ruling later this month.
   In Portland, Ore., Pacificorp spokeswoman Dolores Chenoweth said
the report of the Cumming offer caught her by surprise but that it
should have no effect on the merger.
   ``We have an agreement with UP&L, and that merger agreement is
in force,'' said Chenoweth. ``We fully expect to receive approval
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to go ahead'' with
the merger.
   Chenoweth pointed out that the PacificCorp-UP&L merger has
already been voted on and agreed to by shareholders of both
companies and approved by regulatory agencies in seven states.
   ``So there's no reaction for us to make. We're just going
ahead,'' she said.
   Despite the delay at FERC, state regulators and industry
analysts expressed skepticism about Leucadia's offer.
   ``The consideration is that the Leucadia offer is lower than
what Pacificorp will offer,'' said utilities analyst Greg Enholm
with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. Pacificorp's minimum offer
under its stock swap agreement is for $32.50 per share.
   ``The major consideration is that UP&L is not in good financial
shape, and the merger could solve those problems,'' he said.
   Leucadia is a holding company with banking, real estate and life
insurance subsidiaries. Local holdings include Leucadia Financial
Corp., formerly Terracor; American Investment Bank; American
Investment Thrift; American Investment Financial; and minority
ownership in Prudential Financial Services Corp.
   Leucadia also owns interests in PHLCORP Inc., formerly Baldwin
United Corp., and BRAE Corp. Cumming is chairman of both companies.

   Champion International Corp. has reopened
five Pacific Northwest mills after workers ratified a three-year
contract.
   Dennis Elder, a Champion spokesman, said Tuesday the wood
products company would bring back its 2,400 union workers on a
staggered basis.
   The mills had been idle since the workers struck June 6.
   Elder predicted it would be late this week or early next week
before all mills were running normally again.
   The strike by the Western Council of Industrial Workers and
International Woodworkers of America ended last week when workers
approved a new contract calling for a $1,400 signing bonus this
year, a 3 percent wage increase for 1989 and a 4 percent raise in
1990.
   The Champion settlement left about 2,700 timber workers still on
strike in the Northwest, spokesmen for the two unions said
Wednesday.
   Some 5,200 IWA members and 800 Western Council members are
voting this week on a proposed settlement with Weyerhaeuser Co.
Results and contract details are to be announced Sept. 13.
