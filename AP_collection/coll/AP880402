<HEAD>Blind Attorney: Airlines Treat Handicapped `Like Baggage'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A blind attorney who was carried forcibly from
a jetliner after a dispute over where she should be seated
complains that airlines look at the handicapped ``as if we're a
safety risk and have to be treated like baggage.''
   The attorney, Peggy Pinder, said Friday she is still angry over
an incident Thursday evening aboard a Midway Airlines jetliner
waiting to take off from Washington's National Airport on a flight
to Chicago.
   After boarding, she said, she sat in a window seat in the second
row from the back of the cabin in the smoking section. But she was
told to move to the first row in the front of the cabin because she
is blind and needed to be closer to a full-door emergency exit.
   When she refused, arguing that there are no federal safety
regulations that require her to sit in a particular seat, police
were summoned and carried her off the plane. She was charged with
trespassing.
   ``It was embarrassing,'' Miss Pinder, 34, an attorney from
Grinnell, Iowa, and a vice president of the National Federation of
the Blind, said in an interview. ``They told the police to carry me
off and they did.''
   She insisted that she sought no confrontation and wanted only to
return to her hometown when the dispute erupted aboard Midway
Flight 179 as it prepared to depart for Chicago.
   The flight was delayed about 45 minutes because of the
confrontation, according to airport officials.
   Ironically, Miss Pinder had flown to Washington to meet with
several members of Congress and officials of the Republican Party
platform committee to discuss problems blind people are having in
air travel.
   She said she was told by a flight attendant that she could not
sit at the rear of the aircraft even though her seat did not block
access to any emergency exit doors because of the airlines' policy
on dealing with handicapped passengers.
   ``Then the captain came. He said, `You will do what the flight
attendant tells you and sit where you're told or not fly on this
airplane.','' she recounted.
   She refused to budge and airport police were called to carry her
off the plane, according to accounts related by airline and airport
officials as well as Miss Pinder.
   ``They (airline officials) feel that blind people are not the
same as other passengers, that we're a safety risk and that we have
to be treated like baggage in order to carry us safely,'' said Miss
Pinder. ``That's not federal law. They violated my rights.''
   She has been summoned to appear at an arraignment on the
trespass charge May 19.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the FAA has no requirements on
where blind passengers should be seated, although the agency has
recomended that they not be seated in a row that has an emergency
exit. Miss Pinder said she sat in a row with no such exit.
   A Midway Airlines spokeswoman, Sandra Allen, said that the
airline has a firm policy of seating handicapped passengers,
including those who are blind, on the front row of the aircraft
cabin because those seats are closest to a floor-level emergency
door.
   Responding to the incident involving Miss Pinder, Miss Allen
said ``she refused to be briefed (on safety procedures) and
maintained she could sit where she wanted ... We could not take off
seated where she was and asked her to step off (the plane) because
she was inconveniencing 100 passengers.''
   Because of her confrontation Thursday night she remained in the
capital another day and on Friday accompanied several other
officials of the National Federation of the Blind to a meeting with
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley to discuss alleged
discrimination against the handicapped by the airlines, a
spokewoman for the federation said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which is part of the
department, is developing new regulations aimed at giving the
airlines closer guidance on how to provide for the handicapped, but
those regulations are not expected to be announced for several
months.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey congressman says ``something just
doesn't smell right'' about a federal banking agency's request for
an FBI check of one of its critics.
   The request to the FBI from a Federal Home Loan Bank Board
official ``smacks of a way of life that seems to be more
appropriate to life in Latin America than it does in the United
States,'' Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., said Friday.
   The FBI check was revealed by an internal bank board
investigation requested by Florio, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce consumer protection subcommittee.
   The report, by bank board Inspector General Paul Gibbons,
disclosed that the office of Rosemary Stewart, bank board
enforcement director, asked the FBI on Aug. 17 to check on William
Juliano, a Mount Laurel, N.J., developer.
   The FBI returned the request, which listed only Juliano's name
and address, stamped ``insufficient information,'' and Ms. Stewart
decided not to pursue the matter.
   Because of Juliano's criticism, Florio had asked for an
investigation of the Federal Asset Disposition Association, the arm
of the Bank Board that manages and sells real estate from bankrupt
savings and loans.
   FADA was under attack from Juliano, other business people and
members of Congress for reported mismanagement and conflicts of
interest.
   Juliano had threatened to bring a class action lawsuit against
FADA on behalf of disgruntled developers who believed they had been
poorly treated by the agency.
   Ms. Stewart told investigators she was asked in June to obtain
the FBI check from FADA General Counsel Robert J. Axley, who said
Juliano had made verbal threats and written nasty letters to then
FADA President Rosyln Payne.
   Axley told the investigators that Ms. Payne asked him to ``have
Juliano checked out'' after she received anonymous telephone calls
in the middle of the night to her unlisted home telephone.
   Axley said he subsequently received a tip that Juliano had ties
to organized crime. However, the bank board report said the tip
referred to someone with a different first name than Juliano's.
   After her request to the FBI was returned, Ms. Stewart said she
learned more about the nature of Juliano's dispute with FADA,
consulted her superiors at the bank board and decided it was not
appropriate for her to resubmit the query to the FBI.
   But Florio said, ``For the bank board to even contemplate
investigating a citizen for complaining raises a lot of questions.
... Something just doesn't smell right here.''
   Ms. Stewart did not immediately return telephone messages left
at her office Friday afternoon. There was no answer at Juliano's
office.
   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the agency acknowledges
that the request to the FBI should never have been made.
   ``Once we were aware of it, we indicated we didn't want that
pursued and after that it was not,'' he said. ``Rosemary, to her
credit, said `Maybe we're not supposed to be doing that sort of
thing.'''
   The bank board has also acknowledged that a law firm hired by
FADA engaged a private detective agency to look into Juliano's
finances.
   FBI spokesman William Carter said the FBI would not consider it
proper to investigate a government critic. The bureau's practice,
he said, is to ask for more information about the reason a
background check is requested and if the explanation is not
appropriate it can recommend administrative or disciplinary actions
against the person who made the request.
   Hoyle said Ms. Stewart has not been reprimanded.

<HEAD>Passover Horseradish Health Hazard Cited By Doctors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horseradish eaten during traditional Passover
dinners can pose a health hazard, says a Jewish doctor whose father
collapsed after consuming an olive-sized serving of the bitter herb.
   Dr. Haya R. Rubin said Friday that her father, Cleveland State
University sociologist Israel Rubin, quickly recovered after he
fainted, keeled over and suffered a small seizure during a Seder,
or traditional Passover meal, several years ago.
   She said the incident shows that people prone to high blood
pressure, heart or artery disease or stroke might be better off if
they let horseradish fumes evaporate by keeping it uncovered for a
half hour before the Seder, or use a substitute such as chopped
romaine lettuce stalks.
   Rubin suffered high blood pressure before the incident, said his
daughter, an internist at the University of California, Los
Angeles, and consultant to the Rand Corp.
   The Passover holiday, which celebrates the Israelites' Exodus
from slavery in ancient Egypt, extends from Friday night until
sundown April 9. Seders are held on the first two nights.
Horseradish is eaten during the ceremonial meal as a ``bitter
herb'' symbolizing the bitterness of slavery.
   A letter warning that horseradish can be dangerous was published
Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Ms.
Rubin and Dr. Albert W. Wu, a clinical instructor at the University
of California, San Diego.
   Wu said the horseradish-induced sudden loss of blood pressure
that caused Rubin to faint and collapse could trigger a fatal
stroke, heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm in people with heart
disease.
   Wu and Ms. Rubin trained together at Mount Sinai Medical Center
in New York. They decided to write the letter after Wu spotted a
letter about a similar incident published in the same journal in
January.
   In that letter, Dr. Daniel E. Spitzer of Montefiore Hospital in
New York told how a healthy 63-year-old man collapsed after eating
a large mound of wasabi, or green-colored Japanese horseradish,
during a meal of sushi.
   Spitzer's letter was headlined: ``Horseradish Horrors: Sushi
Syncope.'' Syncope means fainting. The follow-up letter by Ms.
Rubin and Wu carried the headline ``The Bitter Herbs of Seder: More
on Horseradish Horrors.''
   Ms. Rubin said horseradish usually is grated. But the night her
father collapsed, the family ground it in a food processor, then
placed it in an airtight container, preventing vapors from escaping
and making the horseradish unusually potent.
   Wu said the collapse probably occurred because the horseradish
vapors caused a reflexive drop in blood pressure. Coupled with the
elder Rubin's consumption of Passover wine and use of medicine to
reduce his high blood pressure, that briefly deprived the brain of
enough blood.
   ``He still eats horseradish,'' Ms. Rubin said. ``My dad is sort
of macho.''

<TEXT>
   About 400 people huffed and puffed
Friday at the 17th annual Hash Bash, a spring rally for the
legalization of marijuana.
   Police made no arrests and issued no citations during the event
on the University of Michigan campus. University officials had
issued a permit for the event but emphasized they were not
endorsing it.
   Possession of small amounts of marijuana in Ann Arbor is
punishable by a $5 fine.
   ``I've been coming to this since I was a little boy,'' said a
29-year-old who called himself Jizmo Noodles and was one of the
first to light up. ``My first one was in 1973. It's a means of
expression, civil disobedience.''
   Noodles, carrying incense and wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a
denim vest with a peace sign, described himself as a ``student of
life.''
   Jon Gettman, assistant director of the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, told the gathering that pot
smokers were tired of being labeled criminals.
   ``We're here for a lot of different reasons today,'' he said.
``A lot of people think that because this is April Fools' Day, that
this is some some kind of a joke. We are serious, very serious.''
   NORML wants marijuana legalized, with taxes on it used to
develop treatment centers for cocaine and heroin users.
   Mark Amicone, sophomore history major, said he started smoking
marijuana at 16. ``I got a late start,'' he said.

   American corporations that owe taxes to Panama
will be allowed the U.S. foreign tax credit if payments are made to
the government of ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, the
Internal Revenue Service says.
   Friday's announcement was aimed at discouraging U.S. businesses
from sending tax payments to the Panamanian government controlled
by military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, which Washington does
not recognize.
   Some large U.S.-based multinational firms recently made
quarterly tax payments just in time to give that government a
desperately needed infusion of cash.
   The foreign tax credit is designed to prevent two national
governments from taxing the same dollar of income. In general, the
United States will not tax income that an American corporation
earns in and pays taxes on to a foreign country.
   
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The General Accounting Office recommends
mandatory inspection of all nuclear power plants for pipe
deterioration following findings that nearly one-third of the
nation's commercial reactors already have such a problem.
   The congressional watchdog agency deemed the industry-wide
inspections necessary after reviewing actions taken by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the utilities themselves since a pipe
rupture at the Surry Unit 2 plant in Virginia killed four workers
in late 1986.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who released the GAO report,
declared that the NRC's ``failure to act aggressively on this
matter is astounding.''
   After the Surry accident, the NRC did develop evidence of
widespread pipe deterioration at the Trojan nuclear plant in
Oregon, and as of Jan. 21 this year the commission had identified a
total of 34 plants with at least some pipe damage caused by erosion
or corrosion.
   In defense of the NRC's approach, Robert Newlin, a commission
spokesman, said the commission had sent out ``several notices'' to
the industry asking them to inspect their own plants and report
back.
   
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Taking advantage of an appeals court ruling
earlier this week, the Army has ordered a resumption of random drug
testing of civilian employees in certain critical jobs.
   ``The directive went out today,'' Paige Eversole, an Army
spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said Friday. ``It orders resumption of
the program effective immediately.''
   The move had been expected since Tuesday, when a federal appeals
court struck down a preliminary injunction that had stopped the
drug-testing program a month ago.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it
was staying the injunction granted to employee unions while it
considered the legal merits of the case.
   
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Veterans Administration is raising its
maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home mortgages by
one-half percentage point to 10 percent.
   The VA said it was making the change, which will take effect
Sunday, to reflect recent increases in interest rates in financial
markets.
   In the past 12 months, the VA rate has been changed seven times,
fluctuating between 9.5 percent and 11 percent. The last change was
Feb. 1, when the rate was lowered a full percentage point from 10.5
percent to 9.5 percent.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Friday that the
national average for 30-year conventional mortgages, those without
government guarantees, rose above 10 percent for the first time
since late January. The national average rate was 10.05 percent, up
from 9.99 percent the previous week.
   
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Air Force has rewritten its contracts
covering development of the new Midgetman mobile nuclear missile,
canceling almost $1 billion worth of work planned by six
contractors.
   The service, in a brief statement, stressed it could not speak
for the six contractors involved but estimated the cutbacks could
affect the jobs of as many as 2,300 private-sector employees.
   The Air Force action became inevitable several months ago when
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci decided the Pentagon could not
afford to develop and deploy the single-warhead Midgetman within
the budget levels set by the White House and Congress.
   The Air Force had recommended Carlucci kill the program
outright, but the defense secretary decided to request $200 million
in fiscal 1989 to keep the program alive pending a final decision
by the next president.
   
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Food and Drug Administration is warning
consumers not to use Nutrien and Vitalite powdered drink mixes
because they may be contaminated with salmonella bacteria.
   Both products are nutritional supplements marketed as powdered
drink mixes by Sunrider International of Torrance, Calif., and
marketed nationally through more than 37,000 independent
distributors, generally individuals who sell them door-to-door or
to friends.
   The FDA reported there have been at least seven cases of illness
associated with the products.
   It said Sunrider has agreed to begin a nationwide recall, but
has not supplied the agency with specific distribution information.

   The leader of the August coup attempt
that almost toppled the government of President Corazon Aquino
escaped Saturday from his prison ship in Manila Bay, the military
announced.
   A statement said former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan
fled at about 2:30 a.m. Saturday (1:30 p.m. EST Friday) aboard two
rubber boats along with 13 of his guards.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a massive search for
the 39-year-old Honasan and alerted subordinate commands nationwide
to be on the lookout for him.
   The charismatic former lieutenant colonel had been detained on
the navy ship since his arrest last December in a Manila suburb.
   Col. Oscar Florendo, chief military spokesman, said a reserve
lieutenant who was frustrated over his inability to obtain a
regular commission had aided in the getaway.
   Florendo said the boats used in the escape had been sent to
increase security after the military learned of a plot to free
Honasan.
   De Villa immediately relieved the commander of the vessel, the
RPS Andres Bonifacio, and ordered his arrest, Florendo said in a
radio address. He appealed to the public to provide information to
help recapture Honasan.
   Honasan, former chief of security at the Defense Ministry,
played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, mutiny which triggered the
popular uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But Honasan became disillusioned with Marcos' successor,
President Corazon Aquino, accusing her of ``weak and inept''
leadership that fortified the 18-year-old communist insurgency.
   On Aug. 28, Honasan led a force of 2,000 men who attacked the
presidential palace and seized several media and military
installations in the capital before they were driven off by
pro-Aquino forces.
   The coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds, and
Mrs. Aquino said it was aimed at killing her and her family.
   Honasan's effort was the most serious of several major plots to
unseat Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
former colonel was so popular that he had become the ``dominant
figure'' aboard the ship which was supposed to be his prison.
   ``It is with sadness that the AFP (Armed Forces of the
Philippines) makes public the unfortunate escape from custody of
ex-Col. Gregorio Honasan from his detention,'' Florendo said in a
statement. ``During a normal inspection of the ship, it was
discovered that subject detainee together with his guards headed by
Lt. j.g. Gerardo Mojica and 12 enlisted personnel were found
missing.
   ``Initial investigation revealed that Honasan was apparently
assisted and joined by his guards led by Lt j.g. Mojica ... It is
believed that bribery was a factor that led to the betrayal of
their oath and sworn duty.''
   Florendo said de Villa had alerted the military to take
precautions to ensure that Communist rebels did not take advantage
of the confusion to launch ``terroristic actions.''
   The spokesman said troops were being deployed around Manila to
search for Honasan.
   Florendo said the military received information a week ago that
Honasan would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the
ship.
   He said the military expected outsiders to try to storm the
vessel but ``instead it came from the inside.''
   Honasan was security chief of the Defense Ministry when
opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile was minister of national defense.
Enrile was fired in November 1986 after the government said it
thwarted a coup attempt by his followers.
   Honasan remained in hiding for months after the August coup.
Brig. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the National Capital
Regional Defense Command, said weeks before the arrest that Honasan
was being protected by undisclosed civilian and military figures.

   Douglas Edwards, one of the ``founding fathers''
of broadcast journalism, signed off after more than four decades on
the air by thanking his coworkers and his viewers during his last
TV appearance for CBS.
   ``And so ends the chapter of almost 46 years as this reporter
moves on along the journey,'' Edwards, 70, said on Friday's midday
``CBS Newsbreak.''
   ``A deep bow of gratitude, love and respect to the men and women
of CBS News and to the company for which they stand. To you out
there, thank you for honoring me with your presence in my audience,
and most of all for your voices, your most sweet voices. Douglas
Edwards, CBS News, New York.''
   Edwards was the nation's first nightly TV anchorman, preceding
Walter Cronkite in the job at CBS in 1948.
   Edwards joined CBS Radio in 1942, and was a member of Edward R.
Murrow's legendary London staff toward the end of World War II. He
also served as Paris bureau chief.
   Edwards' last radio broadcast was Friday night. At its close,
CBS News vice president Joe Dembo wished Edwards ``goodbye and
Godspeed,'' and CBS Evening News anchorman Dan Rather saluted him
as ``one of the founding fathers'' of broadcast journalism.
   President Reagan sent a congratulatory letter calling Edwards a
``consummate professional.''
   Edwards plans to move to Sarasota, Fla., and continue lecturing
on broadcast journalism while he starts work on a book.

   Hall of Fame pitcher Vernon ``Lefty''
Gomez was hospitalized after complaining of chest pains, and was
expected to remain in the hospital for several days, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Gomez, 79, was in improved condition, Marin General Hospital
nursing supervisor Diana Rich said Friday night. ``He's doing very
well, but he'll be here awhile longer,'' she said.
   Gomez has a longstanding heart condition.
   He was driven to the hospital by his wife, June, from their home
in nearby Novato, 25 miles north of San Francisco.
   ``If he lets me drive him, he has to be sick,'' Mrs. Gomez said.
``Thirteen years ago he had a heart attack and he drove me to the
hospital. He said he didn't trust me to drive. Then he had a triple
bypass.''
   Gomez, a strong left-hander who pitched for 14 years in the
major leagues, all but one year with the New York Yankees, had a
career record of 189-102. He was 6-0 in appearances in five World
Series.

   Gunmen in a passing car opened fire
indiscriminately on people gathered in several groups along a
street Friday night, killing one and wounding at least 10, police
said.
   Among the wounded was a 4-year-old boy shot four times, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   The shooting started around 7:20 p.m. when several gunmen in a
car ``indiscriminately fired at people who were on a sidewalk,''
said Deputy Police Chief William Rathburn.
   At least 11 people initially were reported wounded, although
Rathburn said others may have been hit.
   Four people were taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center,
where a 19-year-old man shot in the right side was pronounced dead,
said hospital spokeswoman Adelaida de la Certa.
   The 4-year-old boy was in serious but stable condition, Ms. de
la Certa said.
   A 29-year-old man hit in the right hand and right leg and a
20-year-old man shot in the left leg were both in fair condition.
   The other seven wounded were taken to other hospitals, she said.
   Drive-by shootings have become a problem in recent months in the
Los Angeles area. Police have attributed many of them to gang wars,
but did not say if Friday's shootings were gang-related.

<HEAD>New Evidence That Millions Of Small Comets Hit Earth Each Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after an Iowa physicist nearly
ruined his reputation by suggesting that 10 million small, speedy
comets hit Earth's atmosphere annually, a NASA scientist has found
evidence supporting Louis Frank's theory.
   ``I'm happy, but it's been a long two years,'' Frank said
Friday, adding that he was met with ``total disbelief'' and ``lost
a lot of friends'' after proposing that billions of water-bearing
comets could have provided enough water to fill the seas during
Earth's early history.
   Other scientists said they remained skeptical of the new
evidence, which came from telescope observations by Clayne Yeates,
a physicist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.
   ``I'm very convinced that what I'm seeing is real,'' said
Yeates, who is deputy project scientist for the planned 1989 launch
of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter. ``These objects would not
have been seen inadvertently during other searches. They're small,
they're dark and they're moving fast.''
   The theory by Frank, a physicist at the University of Iowa, is
``one of the decade's most controversial astronomical theories,'' a
NASA news release said.
   Frank proposed the theory after ultraviolet photographs of Earth
taken by NASA's Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft between 1981 and
1986 revealed countless dark spots that appeared to be tiny holes
in Earth's atmosphere.
   He theorized that about 10 million comets, essentially
30-foot-diameter fluffy snowballs with a dark coating, plunge into
the atmosphere each year, forming holes, then breaking up and
vaporizing.
   Yeates said his observations on the 36-inch Spacewatch Telescope
at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona make him believe that
at least a million such comets hit the atmosphere annually at a
speed of 22,000 mph.
   The comets appeared as white streaks on enhanced telescope
images, he said.
   In a telephone interview from Iowa City, Frank said a
soon-to-be-published study, in which atmospheric holes were
recently observed by Sweden's Viking spacecraft, also supports his
theory.
   ``I'm a little skeptical,'' said astronomer Anita Cochran of the
University of Texas at Austin. ``He (Yeates) may be seeing
something, but to leap to 10-meter comets is a fairly large leap of
imagination.''
   Cochran voiced the most common objection to Frank's theory: If
so many icy comets hit Earth's atmosphere, they also should strike
the moon, creating a lot of water vapor. Yet the moon has very
little water vapor.
   University of Michigan physicist and planetary scientist Thomas
Donahue said that until he examines Yeates' findings, ``I'm not
going to say this sounds like confirmation of Frank's comets or
not. But it certainly is exciting.''
   About a year ago, Donahue used 1977 data from the Voyager 2
space probe to show that Earth's atmosphere contained an excess of
hydrogen atoms released from water vapor. He said the discovery
could be consistent with Frank's theory, but also could be
explained if the hydrogen came from 10 million times fewer comets
that were smaller, faster and much more active than those
postulated by Frank.
   The less abundant comets wouldn't provide enough water to fill
the oceans, Donahue said.
   ``I really am a bit skeptical'' of Yeates' observations, said
Brian Marsden, associate director for planetary sciences at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
   ``If they (comets) are as numerous as he's talking about, then
some of these should show up when the telescope is in more normal
operation, and they haven't,'' Marsden said.
   Frank said only two specialized telescopes in the country,
including Spacewatch, are capable of observing the comets.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch says he disagrees with
Jesse Jackson on virtually every issue, but will vote for Jackson
if he is the Democratic presidential nominee.
   ``I think that in three weeks, based on all the social programs
we would be putting into effect (under Jackson), if you did
everything he said he wanted to do, we'd be in bankruptcy,'' Koch
said Friday. ``People know that's pie in the sky.''
   In response, Jackson's campaign manager, Jerry Austin, said Koch
has ``solidified his position in the national exaggeration hall of
fame.''
   Koch said Jackson is ``on the wrong side of every issue I know
of with two exceptions: drugs _ he's great in opposition to drugs _
and he's great in talking about the need for family responsibility
and particularly as it relates to education.
   ``On the economy, he's terrible. We'd be in bankruptcy.''
   Nevertheless, the mayor said, he'd vote for Jackson if he were
the nominee out of party loyalty and because ``he'd be better than
(Vice President George) Bush.''
   In Green Bay, Wis., Jackson told reporters he had not heard of
Koch's remarks. But when they were described to him he said,
``That's unfortunate. I should not dignify that statement.''

   Iowa Democrats say they'll expose and

<HEAD>Jailed Opposition Leader Called ``Hostage''; U.S. Boosts Military
Presence</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers were off the streets as
Easter weekend began and a jailed opposition leader's wife said her
husband was being held hostage in Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
effort to maintain power.
   Also Friday, the Pentagon said it was sending 1,300 more
military personnel to protect U.S. bases and thousands of American
residents, bringing to nearly 12,000 the number of U.S. troops in
Panama.
   Opposition leaders said they planned to meet today or Sunday to
decide whether to lift a 12-day-old general strike that has shut
down most commercial activity in an effort to oust Noriega,
Panama's de facto leader and heads of its 15,000-member Defense
Forces.
   Virtually all businesses were closed for Good Friday. The
general strike had eased earlier in the week, with groceries and
pharmacies reopening, reportedly under government pressure.
   In the United States, news reports said Reagan administration
officials had discussed trying to force Noriega from power through
military intervention, kidnapping or by arranging a coup.
   The general is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges.
   Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a top leader of the opposition
National Civic Crusade, spent his fifth day in jail Friday. Other
Crusade leaders and several journalists arrested with him Monday
had all been released by midday Tuesday.
   ``All legal efforts on his behalf have been useless,'' Vilma
Gonzalez de la Lastra told The Associated Press Friday night.
``They have not charged him, but they don't let him go.
   ``We consider Carlos a political hostage,'' she said of her
husband.
   The Pentagon said many of the U.S. personnel to be dispatched
next week are military police, but army helicopter units will be
included.
   The U.S. Southern Command, based in Panama, had about 600
security personnel among its 10,000 troopers before Washington
intensified its campaign for Noriega's removal.
   Over a 10-day period that ended March 24, the Pentagon
dispatched 670 more security personnel to Panama for the stated
purpose of protecting military facilities.
   Southern Command spokesman Col. Ronald Sconyers said the latest
troop increase was prompted by ``a longstanding look at what has
been going on down here.'' He said it was not made in anticipation
of an imminent departure of Noriega and any instability that might
follow.
   No evacuation plans have been discussed with the 45,000
Americans living in Panama, he added.
   Limitations on movement for U.S. military personnel were
decreased Friday to the lowest of four levels for the first time
since the crisis began Feb. 26, permitting them to move freely but
avoid crowds and demonstrations.
   Panamanian police patrols replaced soldiers Friday for the first
time since a failed March 16 coup attempt against Noriega. It was
an indication of how the city has quieted for the holiday weekend,
after weeks of protest.
   Banks have been closed since March 3, and Panamanians who had
cash appeared to be using it only for essentials.
   Despite rumors the decision to lift the strike had been made,
two Crusade leaders, Roberto Aleman and Luis Casco Arias, said that
was not the case.
   ``To the contrary, no decision on that will be made until we are
able to meet to discuss it,'' said Casco Arias.
   The National Council of Private Enterprise, an umbrella group of
business organizations, has decided to continue the stoppage,
Aleman said.
   Noriega supporters in the National Legislature ousted civilian
President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26 after Delvalle tried to
fire the general.
   The United States subsequently froze Panamanian government
deposits in U.S. banks in an effort to drive out Noriega. The
shortage of money and a run on Panama's banks forced them to shut
down.

<TEXT>
   The right-wing Nationalist
Republican Party has vowed to seek a nullification of the
Legislative Assembly elections, in which it fell short of a clear
majority by gaining 30 of the 60 seats.
   Party leaders accused the Central Elections Council of
manipulating the official results of the March 20 balloting, which
were announced Friday.
   The council said the party known by its Spanish acronym Arena
won 30 seats, President Jose Napoleon Duarte's centrist Christian
Democrat 23 and the conservative National Conciliation Party seven.
   Arena emerged as the strongest single party, replacing the
Christian Democrats, but its failure to win a majority could
produce a legislative deadlock during Duarte's final year in office.
   National Conciliation lawmakers were reported considering an
alignment with the Christian Democrats. That would give them the
balance of power on major issues and counter Arena's strength.
   In the outgoing Legislative Assembly, elected in March 1984, the
Christian Democrats had 33 seats and Arena 13.
   Mario Samayoa, president of the elections council and a director
of the Christian Democratic Party, said the final results presented
an ``interesting situation because no party will predominate.''
   He also said that while the computer count of votes for mayors
in the nation's 262 municipalities was not complete, it appeared
Arena candidates had won in 178 races.
   The elections council report was denounced by angry Arena
leaders, who earlier had claimed their party won 35 assembly seats
and a firm majority.
   On Tuesday, Arena removed its representative from the panel of
observers from the three major parties overseeing the vote count.
   Francisco Merino, the Arena representative, said the Christian
Democrat and National Conciliation delegates were trying to make a
``game of the vote tallies in order to change the results of the
elections.''
   Roberto d'Aubuisson, the former army major who founded Arena,
said the alliance would petition the council to nullify the
official results and if that was rejected the issue would be taken
to the Supreme Court.
   Three days after the election, d'Aubuisson had said ``we don't
want to promote violence. But we want to play clean and they won't
let us.''
   Samayoa said Friday that Arena would have to accept the results
and ``re-evaluate its positions.''
   The National Association for Private Enterprise declared it
would call a general strike if the elections council did not report
an Arena majority.
   Duarte, a staunch U.S. ally, was elected in 1984 and is barred
by the constitution from seeking another five year term next year.
   In the 1984 campaign he pledged to improve the economy and end
the 8-year-old war with leftist rebels.
   Arena had based its campaign this year on the continuing
conflict, unemployment estimated at 40 percent and inflation
running at an annual rate of 40 percent.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy says it has succeeded in
using underwater robots to locate mines in the Persian Gulf for the
first time since mine-sweeping operatons began last year.
   A spokesman for the Florida-based U.S. Central Command said the
Navy used the devices to locate two mines in the so-called Farsi
channel of the northern gulf, where the U.S. mine-sweeping
operations have been concentrated.
   He spoke on condition he not be identified.
   On Monday, the mine sweeper Fearless used its new ``Super Sea
Rover,'' as the submersible is known, to locate a mine tethered to
a seabed anchor in 90 feet of water, he said.
   On Wednesday, the Fearless' submersible robot found another
mine, this time by following an anchor and cable to where the
explosive lay on the bottom, the spokesman said Friday.
   Both mines, covered with a layer of marine growth indicating
they had been in the water a long time, were detonated by Navy
divers.
   The Navy also said Friday that it has found and destroyed 41
mines in the gulf since its sweeping operations began.
   The updated figure doubles the number of mines previously
reported to have been destroyed by the Americans.
   In late November, after the Navy's Korean War-vintage ocean mine
sweepers went into action and quickly found 15 mines in the
northern gulf, commanders reported the mine threat was ``under
control.''
   On Friday, when asked about the current situation, the Navy said
through its spokesman that ``our mine countermeasure force is
well-suited for the requirements at hand.''
   U.S. officers have refused to say whether they have found
evidence of any recent mine-laying activity by Iran, which is
believed to have planted the explosives.
   The mines found by the U.S. Navy, as well as about 20 found in
other areas of the gulf by the French and the British navies, were
all of the 1908-model contact-type, which explode when a ship bumps
against their detonator spikes.
   One such mine damaged the 401,283-ton supertanker Bridgeton
during the first northbound convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers
July 21.
   The Bridgeton incident prompted the United States and five
European governments to send mine sweepers to the gulf.
   The Soviets and Saudi Arabia also maintain minesweeping vessels
in the waterway, where the ``tanker war,'' an offshoot of the
7{-year-old Iraq-Iran war, has raged for four years.
   The U.S. spokesman said the 41 mines destroyed by the Navy are
in addition to 14 others that were recovered intact for research
purposes.

<TEXT>
   Overseas Brats, a magazine for
Americans who went to high school half a world away from their
homeland, is helping them find classmates they haven't seen for
years, says its Army brat publisher.
   ``The difference between stateside graduates and Army brats, Air
Force brats, Navy juniors and others is that those in stateside
have a hometown to go to for a reunion,'' said publisher and editor
Joe Condrill.
   ``But the brats, after they graduate, they leave the military
environment and sometimes are lost,'' he said.
   Military dependents often are seen as pampered kids living off
their globe-traveling parents, Condrill said recently. But they
endure hardships abroad and often have trouble adjusting to
American life, he said.
   Class reunions help by bringing overseas graduates together, he
said.
   ``These people need someone who understands their predicament,''
said Condrill, 32.
   At least 1 million people have gone to overseas U.S. schools
since the institutions were created in 1946, Condrill said. More
than 80,000 students attend overseas schools each year and more
than 5,000 graduate.
   ``We're not going to find everybody through the magazine, but at
least this is one way of finding some of them,'' said Condrill,
whose father was an Army colonel.
   Condrill, a 1973 graduate of the Tehran American High School in
Iran, said many military dependents are unable to have 10-year high
school reunions like graduates of stateside schools because their
classes usually are so small. Some cannot return to their alma
maters because it would be too expensive.
   Because of the difficulty in organizing reunions, many students
who attended a particular overseas school get together, even if
they graduated in different years.
   ``These reunions create incredible bonds,'' Condrill said.
``When you put these people together I'm not surprised to see
strangers talking like old friends.''
   Condrill, who founded his quarterly magazine in 1986, boasts
1,000 subscribers in the United States and 12 countries.
   During the day he works for a floor products company, but spends
evenings and weekends answering correspondence or writing stories
for Overseas Brats. His byline appears on most stories, but there
are a few subscribers who offer articles reminiscing about growing
up overseas.
   The 12-page tabloid also carries announcements about upcoming
reunions and personal advertisements that resemble lost-and-found
ads.
   Peggy Roth, a 1976 graduate of George Dewey High School in Subic
Bay, the Philippines, organized a reunion in 1986 before the
magazine was founded. She says the magazine has made finding
friends much easier today.
   ``Overseas Brats has been a big help,'' said the Arlington,
Texas, woman. ``It's interesting reading other people's
experiences, and it has made me realize that we are a unique group,
sort of a loose fraternity. It has helped us unite.''
   Condrill also has helped organize reunions. In 1982, only six
overseas schools held reunions, but 30 three-day reunions are
planned this summer throughout the country, Condrill said.
   ``This takes them back to a happier time, to a more innocent
time in their lives,'' he said. ``At these things they are not
talking about kids, about taxes. They feel much younger than they
are and they're talking with people who were in the same
predicament as they were.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is borrowing a few pages from the populist
playbooks of rival Jesse Jackson and ex-rival Richard Gephardt as
the presidential candidates try to drum up delegates in next week's
Wisconsin primary.
   With Dukakis and Jackson neck-and-neck in the delegate count
thus far _ Dukakis with 653.55 to Jackson's 643.55 _ another 81
delegates are at stake in Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin.
   Both candidates also planned weekend forays into Colorado, which
holds caucuses Monday that begin the selection process for 45 of
the state's 51 Democratic delegates and its 36 GOP delegates to the
national conventions.
   The Massachusetts governor on Friday stepped up his quest for
blue-collar votes in Wisconsin by sounding the themes of economic
populism that had been articulated by Gephardt until the Missouri
congressman exited the race last month.
   ``The human cost of seven years of Republican indifference is
staggering,'' Dukakis said in a television ad that started airing
Friday. ``Who in this administration could look right into the eyes
of the laid-off factory worker or the homeless family and say
they've kept the promise of America? I say they've broken that
promise.''
   The new emphasis was evident in his speeches as well.
   ``Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams aren't the model
for a new America,'' Dukakis told a crowd of about 500 people
crowded into the Racine Labor Center.
   Gephardt, interviewed on the syndicated show ``One on One,''
said he didn't mind seeing his ideas circulate among those left in
the race he'd once hoped to finish first.
   ``Everybody has stolen it,'' he said. ``I willed it to everybody
when I pulled out and I hope they will use it. It is the issue of
this campaign.''
   Jackson, who sounds the populist message as well, on Friday
called for higher prices for farm products and said consumers
easily could pick up the tab.
   ``The fact is farmers deserve fair prices and workers deserve
fair wages and the rich must pay fair taxes,'' Jackson told a
gathering at the farm of Bud and Faye Lee in Amery, Wis. ``The
reality is if urban people are working, they can pay a few more
pennies for a glass of milk or for a cone of ice cream or for a
loaf of bread.''
   Jackson, speaking later Friday in La Crosse, invited disgruntled
Republicans to vote for him in Tuesday's primary.
   For people who made the ``colossal error'' of voting for
President Reagan and now ``realize your mistake, you can correct
your error,'' he said. Wisconsin law allows voters to select a
candidate from any party regardless of their political affiliation.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., lagging behind in the Democratic
race, continued to be the main voice of criticism against Jackson,
whose popularity has surged in recent contests.
   ``An end to bigotry does not mean some candidates are game for
criticism and some are immune,'' Gore said.
   Bringing up the rear was Paul Simon, who aimed his fire at Gore.
   Simon, visiting about 100 supporters at an airport rally in Eau
Claire, accused Gore of making bold promises to farmers and added:
``If you're looking for a candidate with all kinds of easy
promises, I'm not your candidate. I voted against the 1985 farm
program that caused a drop in milk prices. We have to do better and
I won't make promises, unlike some people.''
   Gore favors government price supports for dairy farms and is
proposing a two-tier support formula that he said would help family
farms compete against corporate farms.
   On the Republican side, 47 delegates were at stake in Wisconsin,
with Vice President George Bush the commanding leader over token
competitor Pat Robertson.
   Robertson was spending the weekend in Colorado, which holds
caucuses Monday, trying to drum up some support Western-style. His
schedule included talks to an estimated 5,000 people in Denver-area
congregations on Easter Sunday.
   Robertson has conceded he has virtually no chance of being the
GOP nominee, but wants to help influence the GOP platform at the
convention.
   ``He wants to represent conservatives and Christians in the
formation of the platform so that we can have a voice,'' said aide
David Nelson.

   Four youths linked to a Los Angeles youth gang
were defiant and almost boastful as they admitted raping a
13-year-old girl and stealing a dollar from her, police said.
   The gang members also were accused of robbing a 17-year-old of
his watch and wallet Thursday night, then looking for a girl to
rape, Assistant Police Chief Richard Kirkland said Friday.
   ``Last evening they said the sole purpose of them getting
together was simply to commit a sexual assault,'' said Lt. Ron
Glensor, who interviewed three of the four youths arrested.
   Police said the youths were defiant and almost boastful as they
talked.
   The youths stole a car Tuesday, decorated it with graffiti, then
plotted Thursday's night of crime, Kirkland said.
   The girl told investigators she was riding her bicycle with her
brother and a friend when a car carrying the youths drove by.
   The strangers threw concrete blocks at her and her two
companions, who ran in different directions, she said. The four
youths threatened her with an ax handle and force her into the car.
   She said she was driven to a remote area, raped by all four,
robbed of her dollar bill, then dropped off back in town, where she
telephoned police.
   William Wright, 22, and Marc Banks, 19, were arrested Thursday
night for investigation of kidnapping, sexual assault, sexual
assault of a victim under the age of 14, robbery and possession of
stolen property.
   They were held under $122,500 bail each. If convicted they could
face life in prison without parole.
   Wright and Banks came from the Los Angeles area where the
``Crips'' gang is based, Glensor said.
   The juveniles, who were not identified, were held in a detention
center, and have been charged with the same crimes under juvenile
statutes, Glensor said.
   One, a 16-year-old who has lived in Reno about eight months,
told police he was a former member of a California Crips gang that
was a satanic cult, Glensor said. The other is a 13-year-old
apparently recruited from the Reno area.
   The youths wore all-blue Crips-type clothing, from their
bandanas, to jeans, jackets and T-shirts, police said. Pictures of
the suspects and other alleged gang members were confiscated from
the arrested youths.
   The pictures showed gang members holding sawed-off shotguns and
painting Crips graffiti on walls.
   Scores of black Los Angeles area youth gangs are broadly
affiliated under the Crips banner, and are sometimes opposed to
another loose confederation known as the ``Bloods.''
   Authorities have become particularly concerned in recent years
as gang turf wars over drug dealing have intensified. There have
been reports from around the West of Crips members trying to set up
drug rings.

<HEAD>Gandhi Urged To Declare Emergency; 14 More Slain As Security
Stepped Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders in Punjab called on Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi to impose a state of emergency in their
northern state to quell violence by Sikh separatists that has
killed more than 100 people this week.
   Late Friday and early today, Sikh extremists killed 14 more
people in the Punjab state as police stepped up security on
Gandhi's orders, the United News of India reported.
   The prime minister also called the federally appointed Punjab
governor, S.S. Ray, to New Delhi today for urgent consultations on
the violence.
   In addition, police and paramilitary troops began stepping up
security on Pakistan' border with the state, where police say
smugglers have been moving large quantities of new weapons to the
Sikh extremists, UNI said.
   The latest killings raised to 111 the number of people who have
died in Punjab since Sunday in attacks blamed on militant Sikhs who
have since 1982 been waging a guerrilla war for a separate homeland.
   So far this year, more than 635 people have died in Punjab
state, including Hindus and moderate Sikhs. Sikh militants say they
are discriminated against by India's Hindu majority.
   Right-wing Hindu groups called for a general strike in Amritsar
District today to protest the killings. Residents of the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar said about half of the city's shops were shuttered
today, but government offices and schools remained open and
transportion was normal.
   Punjab leaders of Gandhi's Congress Party called Friday for the
state of emergency. They included Bhagwan Dass, vice president of
the state Congress Party's governing committee, two of the state
party's general secretaries and a former president.
   The federal government last month was empowered by Parliament to
impose an emergency in a single state to combat ``internal
disturbances.'' Under an emergency, the government would have the
authority to detain people without warrants, suspend press freedom
and take other steps against the militants.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, make up less than 2 percent of
India's population of 800 million but are in a majority in Punjab.
   UNI said that eight Sikhs, four Hindus and two unidentified
people were killed overnight in three districts of Punjab by
suspected Sikh gunmen.
   Thirty-seven people were reported killed Thursday night and
Friday in the state, the worst one-day toll since March 4, when 45
people were reported slain in a single day, 34 of them at a
festival marking the Indian holiday of Holi.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says George Shultz Suggested Noriega Kidnapping, Other
Measures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has
recommended kidnapping Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega
and a CIA-coordinated military coup as ways of unseating the
general, a newspaper reported today.
   Shultz and Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for
Latin America, also suggested landing more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers
in Panama to encourage Panamanian military officers opposed to
Noriega, said the Los Angeles Times.
   The proposals were strongly opposed by the CIA and Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who labeled them dangerous and
ill-timed, said the Times, quoting unidentified administration
officials on both sides of the discussion.
   However, actions still being considered by the Cabinet include
fomenting a coup against Noriega and landing more than 3,000
soldiers at U.S. installations in Panama in a show of force, the
Times said. A group of Panamanian officers attempted a coup last
month, but failed.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, traveling with Shultz
in Rome, would not comment on the report.
   Shultz and Abrams suggested sending a special operations team to
kidnap Noriega and bring him to the United States for trial on drug
trafficking charges, the newspaper said.
   A kidnapping was ruled out after opponents argued that the
United States' image would be blackened if Noriega were
accidentally killed during such an attempt, the Times said. They
also warned Shultz of the repercussions of arresting a foreign
leader in his own country to face criminal charges in the United
States.
   Shultz and Abrams also proposed taking unspecified military
action inside Panama in response to a request from deposed civilian
President Eric A. Delvalle, the newspaper said. Delvalle was ousted
by Noriega last month after he attempted to fire the general.
   The Pentagon announced Friday that it was sending about 1,300
additional military personnel to Panama to improve security for
U.S. bases and for U.S. civilians living there.
   The move fell far short of the steps advocated by Shultz, who
urged the use of force against Noriega after aides concluded U.S.
economic pressure on the troubled Central American country was
faltering, the Times said.
   The United States already has about 10,000 troops in Panama to
protect the strategic Panama Canal. An additional 17,000 U.S
citizens live in Panama.
   Pressure against Noriega's regime has been mounting since he was
named in a federal indictment alleging he helped drug traffickers
move cocaine into the United States.
   U.S. officials have also alleged that Noriega was dealing with
Cuban President Fidel Castro while was ostensibly cooperating with
U.S. drug and intelligence agencies.
   The Reagan administration precipitated an economic crisis in
Panama last month by cutting off the supply of U.S. dollars to
Panamanian banks. But the maneuver appeared to weaken this week
after Noriega broke a general strike, seized flour mills and
reopened Panama's ports.

<TEXT>
   Jim Jordan, whose likeable but bumbling
Fibber McGee character delighted millions who tuned into radio's
classic comedy ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' for 22 years, is dead at
age 91.
   Jordan died Friday at Beverly Medical Center about a week after
suffering a blood clot in the brain following a fall at his home,
said family friend and broadcast personality Fran Allison.
   ``His show was one of the greatest continuing radio shows that
ever existed,'' said Miss Allison, who starred in early
television's ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' show.
   ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' was on the NBC radio network from
1935 to 1957. It spawned such maxims as: ``Tain't funny, McGee,''
``Heavenly days,'' ``You're a hard man, McGee'' and ``Dad-rat the
dad-ratted ...''
   Familiar routines included McGee's overstuffed closet, which
always unloaded mercilessly on Jordan's character whenever it was
opened.
   Even the McGee's address, 79 Wistful Vista, became a place on
America's cultural roadmap.
   Each Tuesday night, Jordan welcomed to his home such
unforgettable characters as Wallace Wimple, The Old Timer, Beulah
the Maid and Myrt, McGee's omnipresent telephone operator.
   ``Even though he had become very frail, his mind and his humor
were as fresh as ever. We all adored him,'' said Lenore Kingston, a
vice president of Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters. Jordan had served
as chairman of the radio veterans' group.
   Like the couple in the ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' scripts, the
show's stars were married. Jim and Marian Jordan came to radio out
of vaudeville to formulate with writer Don Quinn the quintessential
situation comedy.
   ``We don't like _ I mean, people don't like _ humor that
suggests anything repulsive,'' Jordan said in an interview during
the show's height. Anatomy gags, jibes about marriage and
mothers-in-law were kept out.
   ``It is typically American humor, neither the Broadway type nor
Hollywood influenced,'' Hubbard Keavy of The Associated Press wrote
in 1940. ``They get their humor from simple things like fixing the
brakes or playing checkers. They never just tell jokes. They never
step out of character.''
   The situations in the show turned on such simple items as Fibber
deciding, against Molly's advice, to tune the piano. His bumbling
effort was invariably interrupted by the ``bong-bong'' of the door
chimes.
   The McGees' neighbors were a classic set of American humor
characters.
   Hal Peary played the rumbling, pompous Throckmorton
Gildersleeve; Cliff Arquette was the cantankerous Old-Timer; Bill
Thompson was henpecked Wallace Wimple and Gale Gordon, later a
regular on ``The Lucy Show,'' was Mayor La Trivia.
   After the show ended in 1957, a television version was attempted
in NBC's 1959-1960 season. Of the original cast, only Peary
remained and he played Mayor La Trivia, not Gildersleeve.
   Jordan, a native of Peoria, Ill., met Marian Driscoll at choir
practice when both were in their teens. They married in 1918.
   The couple began appearing on radio in 1925, but still worked
vaudeville because the new medium paid so little. In 10 years of
trial-and-error work, they created Fibber McGee and Molly.
   Mrs. Jordan died of cancer in 1961. Jordan married Gretchen
Stewart the following year. She survives him.
   Other survivors include a son, Jim Jr., and daughter, Kathryn,
from his marriage to Marian, as well as several grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Police combed a neighborhood today for a
carload of gang members who fired on pedestrians as they drove by,
killing one and wounding 12 others, including a 4-year-old boy,
authorities said.
   The gunmen indiscriminately shot at people standing on a
sidewalk Friday night in a gang-ridden area of south Los Angeles,
said Deputy Police Chief William Rathburn.
   No motive was given for the shootings. ```It's a little too
early,'' said a policeman who declined to give his name. ``The
officers are still out there hustling up whatever they can find.''
   Extra officers were dispatched to help look for three men in a
brown Cadillac, Rathburn said.
   Thirteen people were hit by gunfire, said police Cmdr. William
Booth, but only 11 could be accounted for at hospitals. Authorities
said two of the wounded may have sought medical attention on their
own.
   A 19-year-old man shot in the right side was pronounced dead at
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, said hospital spokeswoman
Adelaida de la Certa. None of the victims' names were immediately
available.
   The 4-year-old boy was in serious but stable condition with
wounds in the side, arm and legs, Ms. de la Certa said.
   A 29-year-old man with leg and hand wounds and a 20-year-old man
with a leg wound were in fair condition, she said.
   A man was in critical condition at the Hospital of the Good
Samaritan with gunshot wounds to the stomach and legs, said a
nursing supervisor who refused to be identified. Another man was
treated and released.
   Two men with leg wounds were in fair condition at Daniel Freeman
Memorial Hospital, said nursing supervisor Christie Ciraulo.
   A 29-year-old man was taken to California Medical Center with
minor injuries, but it was uncertain whether he would be admitted,
said a nursing supervisor who refused to give her name.
   A 16-year-old and another teen-age boy were treated at other
hospitals and released, officials said.

   U.S. taxpayers helped the Nicaraguan Contras
smell good, play volleyball and watch TV from a new sofa in 1986,
but U.S. officials refused to approve bills for whiskey and jumbo
shrimp.
   Using the Freedom of Information Act, Peter Kornbluh of the
National Security Archive obtained a 1986 letter to a liaison for
the rebels from the director of the State Department's Nicaraguan
Humanitarian Assistance Office.
   The letter lists some ``approved'' and ``disallowed'' expenses
incurred by the Contras in 1985 and 1986 and submitted to the
office for reimbursement. All items on the list, published in the
May issue of Harper's Magazine, previously had been rejected
``pending further review.''
   Allowed:
   _ $5,760.53 for deodorant.
   _ $1,071 for volleyball equipment.
   _ Two living room sets worth $1,283.63, a dining room set worth
$654.94 and a $477.75 sofa.
   _ 12 domino sets worth $132.18.
   Disallowed:
   _ 16 bottles of whiskey worth $120.
   _ 32 pounds, or $8 worth, of meat for dogs.
   _ $369.82 in Christmas decorations.
   _ 25 pounds of jumbo shrimp worth $235.
   _ $226 in guitar strings.
   The office approved three 19-inch color televisions that cost
about $1,000 each, but rejected two other sets. It approved 620
boxes of candy worth $6,570, but rejected 14 boxes of chocolate and
two boxes of candy worth $381.35.
   The office, which was opened to distribute humanitarian aid
appropriated by Congress and closed in July 1986, did approve a
limited amount of martial aid: two pairs of boxing gloves.
   The Contras have been fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista
government. A 60-day cease-fire went into effect Friday.

<TEXT>
   Breezy weather early today forced
organizers to scratch their attempt at a world-record human-powered
flight across the Aegean Sea by a cyclist-pilot in a flying machine
called the Daedalus.
   Windless weather is important for the 74-mile flight to the
island of Santorini and winds of nearly six miles an hour grounded
the silver-and-pink aircraft on a military runway at the last
moment.
   ``It's disappointing, but the wind seems to be a little too
strong,'' pilot Greg Zack, 26, a professional cyclist from
Wilmington, N.C., told reporters.
   The last-minute postponement illustrated just how unpredictable
the weather can be on this southern Greek island.
   Gusting winds and rain squalls delayed the first scheduled
flight of the Daedalus 88 on Wednesday.
   After nine days of blustery weather, conditions Thursday were
good enough to allow the five athlete pilots to take turns
test-flying the plane at speeds of around 14 miles per hour and
about 15 feet above the tarmac of the Greek air force base.
   A successful touchdown on Santorini (Thira) would more than
triple the exisiting record of 22.5 miles for straight-line
human-powered flight, set by Bryan Allen piloting the Gossamer
Albatross across the English channel in 1979.
   Built of high-tech composite materials _ graphite epoxy, kevlar
plastic fiber and mylar polystyrene film _ the Daedalus plane has a
huge 112-foot wingspan and resembles an outsized insect in flight.
   The flight in a fragile pedal-powered plane is aimed at
emulating Daedalus, the legendary craftsman who flapped his way
across the Aegean on wings of wax and feathers, according to a
3,500-year-old Greek myth.
   According to the myth, Daedalus made it safely across the Aegean
but his son Icarus flew too close to the sun and plummeted to his
death as his wings melted.

   A man working at an archaeological
dig attacked co-workers, stabbing two women to death and injuring a
pregnant woman and her husband, police said.
   The suspect, identified as Arthur Faulkner and believed to be 40
to 45 years old, remained at large today, police said.
   Authorities said they had no motive for the stabbings Friday.
   Police temporarily shut down a nearby expressway and searched a
wooded area in this Philadelphia suburb after the man fled in a
pickup truck registered to one of the victims.
   The four graduate students were ``stabbed with a knife or other
sharp instrument,'' while working in a house where artifacts are
tested, police Capt. John Sheehan said. He refused to say whether a
weapon was recovered.
   Glenn W. Sheehan, 39, was stabbed several times. He ran from the
house to a neighbor's house, then to a construction site where the
archaeological dig was under way, according to witnesses.
   Sheehan was taken to Bryn Mawr Hospital with stab wounds of the
legs, arms and abdomen. He was in stable condition, hospital
officials said.
   His wife, 31-year-old Anne M. Jensen, was taken to Hahnemann
Hospital in Philadelphia, where she was treated for multiple stab
wounds to the back and internal injuries.
   She was in serious but stable condition, said an unidentified
hospital spokeswoman. Her fetus suffered no damage, the spokeswoman
said.
   The couple were working on their doctorates in anthropology at
Bryn Mawr College, college spokeswoman Catherine LaFarge said.
   The two slain women, also graduate students in anthropology and
archaeology, died of multiple stab wounds, Montgomery County
Coroner Dr. Theodore Garcia said.
   Lower Merion Township Police Lt. John Maloney identified them as
Clarice J. Dorner, 30, of Elk Grove Village, Ill., and Annaliese H.
Killoran, 22, of Lynn, Mass.
   WCAU-TV, quoting unidentified police sources, reported that
Faulkner was released from prison last October after serving time
for attempted rape.
   John Jensen, Anne Jensen's brother, said Faulkner was a former
convict who seemed interested in his work as a digger.
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' said Jensen. ``I talked to him
yesterday. He was a solid worker; he never complained.''

   The young officer who led an August
coup attempt that nearly felled President Corazon Aquino's
government fled a prison ship in Manila Bay early today aided by
his elite navy guards.
   Mrs. Aquino cut short a private Easter holiday in northern Luzon
and rushed to the capital for an emergency Cabinet meeting after
hearing of the escape of former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan.
   She told a national television audience Honasan was to have been
court-martialed for leading the bloody Aug. 28 coup attempt, in
which at least 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded.
   Mrs. Aquino warned military personnel that those who assist or
harbor Honasan ``will be dealt with promptly and severely with the
full force of the law.''
   The charismatic soldier escaped at about 2:30 a.m. aboard two
rubber boats along with 14 guards from the navy's Special Warfare
Unit who were guarding him, Col. Oscar Florendo, chief military
spokesman, told reporters.
   Florendo said the roughly half dozen remaining guards fired on
the boats as they slipped away in the darkness, but apparently
missed. The prison ship, the Andres Bonifacio, was anchored 500
yards from the navy's main wharf, he said.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a nationwide search
for the 39-year-old Honasan, who had been on the ship since his
December arrest in a Manila suburb.
   Armored personnel carriers and bulldozers blocked entrances to
military camps in Manila, and checkpoints were set up on major
highways.
   Florendo said a reserve lieutenant who was frustrated over his
inability to obtain a regular commission had aided in the escape.
   ``It is believed that bribery was a factor,'' the spokesman
added, saying the lieutenant and 13 enlisted personnel had
apparently assisted and joined in the escape. He said the boats
used to flee had been sent to increase security after the military
learned of a plot to free Honasan.
   Florendo warned that Honasan may try to organize a new bid to
topple Mrs. Aquino. He said the government expected Honasan to
resume anti-Aquino propaganda efforts and again try to divide the
military.
   Mrs. Aquino said Honasan fled to avoid prosecution for mutiny
and sedition, arson, murder and conduct unbecoming an officer. She
said his escape ``is tantamount to an admission of his guilt.''
   She also said Honasan staged his coup attempt to evade
investigation of alleged misapproriation of $100,000 worth of
military equipment and to avoid a combat assignment against
communist rebels.
   ``I appeal to all citizens and leaders, public and private, to
assist us in the recapture of Honasan as soon as possible,'' she
said.
   Presidential guards stepped up security around the presidential
palace immediately after word of the escape. Civilians were barred
from the palace compound.
   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said the military was ``taking
every possible action'' to bring back Honasan and ``minimize or
neutralize any further damage that he can make.''
   Honasan, former Defense Ministry chief of security, played a key
role in the Feb. 22, 1986 mutiny that with a popular uprising
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But he became disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino, accusing her of
``weak and inept'' leadership that fortified the 19-year-old
communist insurgency.
   On Aug. 28, Honasan led a force of 2,000 men who attacked the
presidential palace and seized several media and military
installations in the capital before they were driven off by
pro-Aquino forces.
   Mrs. Aquino said the attack it was aimed at killing her and her
family.
   Honasan's was the most serious of several major plots to unseat
Mrs. Aquino. The military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted men
involved in the coup attempt are still at large.
   Honasan is widely regarded within the 160,000-member armed
forces as a courageous, experienced officer. Military sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said he is so popular he had
become the ``dominant figure'' aboard the ship that was supposed to
be his prison.
   Florendo said the military received information a week ago that
Honasan would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the
ship, expecting outsiders to try to storm the vessel. ``Instead, it
came from the inside.''
   Honasan was Defense Ministry security chief when opposition Sen.
Juan Ponce Enrile was minister of national defense. Enrile was
fired in November 1986 after the government said it thwarted a coup
attempt by his followers.
   Honasan remained in hiding for months after the August coup.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, former commander of the National
Capital Regional Defense Command, said weeks before the arrest that
Honasan was being protected by undisclosed civilian and military
figures.

   A disc jockey who told a white lie about
the weather found his listeners ready for an April Fools' Day snow
job.
   WKIR-FM radio personality Dan Baxter told a whopper about the
weather that was swallowed hook, line and sinker by some listeners.
His phony forecast _ freezing rain and snow _ in a state where the
merest hint of winter weather sends residents scurrying to the
grocery put a damper on at least one businessman's day.
   ``They said the rain was supposed to turn to sleet and snow, and
the temperature tonight and tomorrow was going to be in the 20s,''
said barber Larry Kirk, who said trade was slow following Baxter's
bogus prediction of icy streets.
   ``I'm not going to listen to that station any more,'' Kirk said.
   The state Highway Patrol was bombarded with anxious calls about
road conditions. Troopers were stymied, however, when they turned
to the National Weather Service for help.
   ``The weather service called us wanting to know where we got our
information,'' station spokeswoman Rhonda Perry said. ``Then the
Highway Patrol called wanting to talk to the station manager. Then,
the Civil Defense called wanting to talk to the station manager.''
   Baxter went on air to apologize, and told listeners he'd lost
his job.
   April Fool!
   ``He's still kidding around,'' Perry said.
   ``The phone hasn't stopped ringing (with listeners concerned for
Baxter) since I got in,'' said Tim Allen, the disc jockey who
follows Baxter.

   A disc jockey's on-air account of an
unidentified flying object causing commotion in a park was so
convincing that some people claimed they witnessed the mysterious
rumble and flash of light.
   ``People are seeing it. But it ain't there,'' said Fred
Honsberger, news director for KDKA-AM, the station that broadcast
the April Fools' Day joke.
   ``We just had a lady call who said she saw a bunch of gray
trucks go in led by a jeep. These people are claiming to have seen
that thing. But we started it all,'' Honsberger said, chuckling.
   Not everyone was laughing.
   Worried listeners flooded the switchboard at the Allegheny
County police station in North Park. Sgt. William Wolverton
repeatedly assured callers there was nothing going on and that the
radio report had been a hoax.
   ``They were pretty much upset with the fact that a radio station
would be allowed to get away it,'' Wolverton said. ``A lot of them
were critical because they picked Good Friday. Good Friday seemed
to be more important than April Fools' Day.''
   Morning disc jockey John Cigna startled his listeners with the
report and offered no explanation or elaboration when he ended his
four-hour broadcast at 9 a.m. But his replacement, Doug Hawkes,
informed listeners it had been a joke.
   ``Remember everyone, today is April Fools' Day,'' Hawkes said.
   None of the morning news reports included the so-called
emergency, Honsberger noted.
   ``That should be a clue to anybody,'' he said. ``If anything was
happening, it would be our lead story. We'd have reporters there.''

<TEXT>
   Tornadoes touched down in five east
Texas towns, destroying two mobiles homes, damaging dozens of
houses and overturning cars, authorities said. One minor injury was
reported.
   In East Mountain, near Longview, a tornado damaged 25 homes
Friday, blowing seven or eight of them off their foundations,
witnesses said.
   ``I was on top of the mountain watching for tails out of the
clouds when the rain began falling so hard you couldn't even see,''
said East Mountain Assistant City Marshal Phil Luchau. ``We knew
the storm was getting worse, but it happened so quick, there wasn't
time to warn anyone.''
   A tornado also destroyed two mobile homes and damaged three
homes in nearby Glenwood Acres, officials said, but it was unclear
whether it was the same tornado that struck East Mountain.
   The city hall, an elementary school and a car dealership
suffered heavy damage at Gladewater, about 20 miles northwest of
Longview. A supermarket and several mobile homes also were hit.
   Another tornado damaged four homes in Mound City, and severely
damaged the Mound City Store.
   ``It just hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Deanna Holden, owner of the
store. ``We just all got underneath the dining room table. If we
hadn't gotten my grandbaby out of her crib, she'd be dead because
of all the flying glass.''
   Shan Haggerty, 10, of Houston was cut on the hand by flying
glass as he crouched beneath a kitchen table of a Mound City home
he was visiting.
   A tornado also was spotted in Union Grove, where strong winds
destroyed one home and damaged at least one other.
   At least four tornadoes hit Anderson County in 1987, killing two
people. Three of them hit the southern part of the county, near
Mound City.
   ``This is a bad area for tornadoes,'' said Tommie Denson of
Mound City. ``We're going to move. I'm going to sell my home and
leave.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz today
received Pope John Paul II's blessing on the eve of his new Middle
East peace mission. The pontiff stressed any accord must respect
the ``legitimate rights'' of both Israel and the Palestinians.
   ``God bless your efforts,'' the pope told Shultz following their
30-minute private meeting in the papal library.
   ``I go from here to the Middle East with your blessing to
sustain the effort'' to spur the Arab-Israeli peace process, Shultz
responded in front of reporters and photographers.
   Shultz leaves for Jerusalem on Sunday on the first part of a
trip that will also take him to Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. His trip to the region last month failed to bring an
agreement.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the talks focused on the
two mens' ``common preoccupation for international peace,''
specifically East-West relations, ``the continuing grave
situation'' in the Middle East and developments in Central America.
   The pope ``insisted on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people and on the moral duty to find a solution that also takes
into account the legitimate rights of Israel,'' the spokesman said.
   John Paul voiced ``great interest in the efforts under way for
the search, obligatory for everyone, of a process that opens the
way to solutions acceptable to all,'' Navarro said.
   The pope has frequently spoken in favor of a Palestinian
homeland.
   The Vatican does not have diplomatic relations with Israel.
Vatican officials have cited the Palestinian question, Israel's
unsettled boundaries and the status of Jerusalem as reasons for the
absence of ties.
   The Vatican does not have diplomatic relations with Jordan
either.
   Shultz, who is Episcopalian, brought to the Vatican today an
entourage of 31 people, including his wife, Helena, a Roman
Catholic.
   After a salute in the Vatican's marbled, frescoed Clementine
room by seven Swiss guards in multi-colored uniforms designed by
Michelangelo, Shultz was ushered into the pope's chambers by
Archbishop Dino Monduzzi, head of the papal household.
   Following the audience, the two were joined by Mrs. Shultz,
wearing a black dress and a black lace mantilla over her head, and
the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, Frank Shakespeare, and his
21-year-old daughter, Fredericka.
   John Paul, wearing white robes, presented Shultz with a framed
sketch by Italian artist Lello Scorzelli. He gave pontifical medals
and rosaries to the others.
   The group then moved to the Salome Throne Room, where the pope
shook hands with the rest of the delegation, including Secret
Service agents and State Department spokesman Charles Redman. The
pope wished them all a happy Easter.
   It was Shultz's third meeting at the Vatican with John Paul. He
and his wife visited the Vatican in 1986 for Easter. The previous
meeting was in December 1982.
   Shultz and his wife are scheduled to attend the pope's Easter
Mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday morning.

   Rain and snow inundated Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado
today after tornadoes in five east Texas towns destroyed two mobile
homes and damaged dozens of houses, a city hall, a school and a car
dealership.
   A tornado that touched down in East Mountain did some of the
worst damage of Friday's east Texas twisters, damaging 25 houses,
officials said. Two mobile homes were destroyed in nearby Glenwood
Acres.
   A tornado in Gladewater extensively damaged the city hall, an
elementary school, a car dealership, a supermarket and several
mobile homes, while a funnel cloud that struck near Mound City
damaged a roof and overturned vehicles.
   A tornado was also spotted in Union Grove, where strong
thunderstorm winds destroyed a home and damaged at least one house.
   The only injury reported was to a 10-year-old Mound City boy
whose hand was cut by flying glass.
   As snow piled up in western Kansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle and
eastern Colorado, flooding became more widespread across Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Kansas.
   Blizzard conditions continued late Friday in the Oklahoma
Panhandle. Twenty-two inches of snow fell at Goodwell and 15 inches
at Guymon.
   Clayton, N.M., had 10 inches of snow and drifts up to 6 feet

   In southeast Colorado, La Junta was blanketed by a foot of snow
in seven hours with 16 inches already on the ground.
   A blizzard warning remained in effect today for western portions
of the Oklahoma Panhandle. Winter storm warnings were issued for
the northern Texas Panhandle and the southeast corner of Colorado.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southeastern South Dakota to eastern sections of Nebraska and
Kansas, the lower and middle Mississippi Valley, Alabama and the
southern and central Appalachians; scattered thunderstorms over
western Georgia and the Florida Panhandle; scattered rain showers
lingering over eastern Texas and northern Oklahoma; and light snow

   Israeli troops opened fire today on
Palestinians who attacked them with rocks, bottles, knives and
metal bars in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and four protesters
were killed, the army said.
   Two Israeli soldiers were injured.
   There were conflicting reports on the number of wounded
protesters. The army said two protesters were wounded by gunfire,
but Palestinian journalists set the number as high as 13.
   The bloodshed broke out as Jews celebrated the first day of
Passover, the weeklong festival celebrating the exodus of the Jews
from Egypt, and a day after Christians marked Good Friday.
   In Gaza City, protesters hurled knives and metal rods at
patrolling troops and tried to seize their weapons, an army
spokesman said. Soldiers opened fire on the attackers, killing
three, he said.
   One soldier suffered stab wounds and was taken to a nearby
hospital, the army spokesman said. His condition was not described
as serious. Another soldier was slightly injured, the military
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with
army regulations.
   Officials at Gaza City's Ahli Arab and Shifa hospitals said they
admitted three Palestinians with gunshot wounds, and Arab reports
said another was transferred to an Israeli hospital.
   Palestinian reporters identified the dead men as Jamil Rashad al
Kourdy, 55, Ahmed Samir al Kourdy, 40, and Hassan al Kourdy, 21.
   In the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem, troops fired at
hundreds of protesters who attacked them with rocks and empty
bottles in the town's main market, and one Arab was killed, the
army said.
   Witnesses in Bethlehem said the violence began in the morning
after soldiers forced shops in the main market to close in
violation of PLO orders that they stay open in the morning but
observe a strike in the afternoon.
   Protest leaders then arrived and forced shops to reopen, the
witnesses said. Hundreds of youths gathered and began moving
through the market streets to central Manger Square, where troops
were stationed.
   As the protesters hurled rocks and empty bottles at the troops,
some soldiers turned and began chasing the youths through the
winding, cobblestoned streets, firing tear gas, rubber bullets and
finally live bullets, the witnesses said.
   They said several demonstrators were wounded.
   Salim Hallas El Shaer, 23, was dead on arrival at nearby Bet
Jalla hospital from a gunshot wound to the head, according to
doctors there and the ambulance driver, who would only give his
name as Issa.
   An army spokesman confirmed the death but said troops only fired
at the man when he approached them with an object that resembled a
firebomb.
   During a hastily organized funeral march for El Shaer along a
main road in Bethlehem, troops fired tear gas and live bullets at
mourners, said a witness who would only give his name as Halman.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   On the street where El Shaer was shot, the branch of an olive
tree was put in a puddle of blood, beside a sign that read: ``The
heroic martyr, Salim.''
   According to U.N. figures, the killings brought the Palestinian
death toll to 131 since unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. One Israeli soldier has died.
   With fewer Holy Week visitors than usual because of the Arab
uprising in its occupied lands, Israel sought to ensure the safety
of thousands of Christians who had come for Easter Sunday
observances.
   The violence came on the day before Secretary of State George P.
Shultz was scheduled to arrive for talks in Jerusalem as he pushes
a Middle East peace plan.
   Shultz was in Vatican City today and received Pope John Paul
II's blessing on the eve of his peace mission. The pontiff stressed
any accord must respect the ``legitimate rights'' of both Israel
and the Palestinians.
   Police and troops were reinforced in and around Jerusalem's holy
sites to protect participants at Easter ceremonies by Christians
celebrating their belief that Christ was resurrected two days after
dying on a cross.
   Disturbances took an early toll on the holiday weekend Friday,
as Israeli troops killed two Arabs and wounded at least 13.

   Officials of the United Methodist Church's
publishing house say they have decided not to publish a book by a
Newark bishop who called for greater understanding of homosexual
relationships and unmarried couples.
   Robert K. Feaster, president of Abingdon Press in Nashville,
Tenn., said in a news release that publishing Episcopal Bishop John
Shelby Spong's book, titled ``Living in Sin? A Bishop Rethinks
Sexuality,'' might be misinterpreted as support for Spong's views.
   ``While the publishing house planned to publish `Living in Sin'
to encourage vigorous debate, it has determined that the church's
publisher could appear to be aggravating fierce controversy, rather
than helping to find solutions,'' Feaster said in the release,
dated Wednesday.
   Abingdon Press officials did not answer calls to their offices
Friday.
   In January, with Spong's backing, representatives of northern
New Jersey's 125 Episcopal parishes voted to give their blessing to
homosexual relationships and unmarried couples and to minister to
those people.
   The Rev. Leslie Smith, a spokesman for Spong, said in a news
release Thursday that five other publishing houses have contacted
Spong about publishing the book. Smith did not return telephone
messages Friday.
   Spong said in the release that ``moralistic repression is not
going to terminate the discussion.''
   He said church leaders need to face up to the changing role of
women and marriage and called for greater understanding of
homosexuality and sexual reproduction alternatives.

   A county judge said he has begun a 40-day
fast to demonstrate his credibility in the face of an attempt to
remove him from the bench for allegedly making sexual advances to a
male court reporter.
   Ramsey County District Judge Alberto Miera, who has denied the
allegation, said Friday his bisexuality and the fact that he is
Hispanic have been factors in the attempt to remove him.
   ``I feel obligated to do that to prevent this kind of abuse and
injustice from happening to other individuals who are socially
vulnerable, and to encourage people to recognize that they have to
stand up and fight even though there may be costs,'' said Miera,
who will take liquids throughout the fast and have one meal every
other day.
   The state Board on Judicial Standards in February recommended
Miera be removed for allegedly making sexual advances to his former
male court reporter and for other judicial misconduct. The judge
was convicted last year of battery for forcibly kissing the former
court reporter.
   The state Supreme Court temporarily suspended him March 9 to
consider the recommendation. Arguments are scheduled May 24.
   ``It's not me that's the issue anymore,'' Miera said. ``It's the
concept of justice, it's the concept of how we treat people, it's
the concept of whether we treat people differently because we're
fearful of what they represent,'' he said.

   Iraq said today that its forces have
overrun Kurdish guerrilla bases in the mountainous northeast in an
offensive aimed at crushing Iranian-backed rebels who threaten
vital oilfields.
   Kurdish guerrilla leaders have claimed the Iraqis, backed by
tanks and air strikes, were dropping poison gas bombs on villages
in what one commander called ``a war of genocide.''
   Baghdad Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a military
communique as saying its troops ``completely purged'' the area
around Qara Dagh in the Sulaimaniyeh region, 50 miles west of the
Kirkuk oilfields.
   Qara Dagh is only 20 miles west of Lake Darbandikhan, where
Iranian Revolutionary Guards have thrust into Iraq in a 16-day-old
offensive.
   ``All traitors have finally been destroyed,'' the communique
declared in a reference to the Iranian-backed Kurdish rebels who
have been fighting Baghdad for an independent homeland for years.
   There was no independent confirmation.
   Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, told
The Associated Press that heavy fighting was raging in the region
Friday but that he had no reports of an Iraqi breakthrough.
   Massud Barzani, leader of the Iranian-backed Kurdish Democratic
Party, said in a statement several days ago, that the Iraqi army
had launched a major offensive against the guerrillas March 23.
   He said two divisions of troops, backed by tanks, artillery and
air strikes, were seeking to dislodge Kurdish fighters from the
Qara Dagh mountains between Kirkuk and the provincial capital of
Sulaimaniyeh.
   An Iraqi division usually numbers about 12,000 men.
   Barzani said the Iraqi assaults had been beaten back.
   He claimed Iraqi warplanes were dropping chemical bombs on
Kurdish strongholds and villages suspected of harboring guerrillas.
   The villages were north of the Iranian bridgehead around Lake
Darbandikhan, where Iran claims Iraqi chemical bombing attacks
March 16-17 killed 5,000 civilians and injured as many more.
   Talabani said the Iraqis had seized some villages. He also
charged the Iraqi air force was dropping gas bombs on Kurdish
settlements.
   ``It's a war of genocide against the Kurdish people,'' he said
in a telephone interview. ``They use chemical weapons against us
all the time and raze our villages.''
   Today's communique said an Iraqi force, including Kurdish
fighters loyal to Baghdad, had overrun 21 Kurdish bases and
villages used by the guerrillas in the last few days. It gave no
casualty figure.
   The Kurdish guerrillas have in the last 18 months created a
second front in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war. The Iraqis have had
to divert tens of thousands of troops badly needed in the main
battle zones in the south to contain the insurgency in Kurdistan.
   The Kurds claimed to control 4,000 square miles in the northeast.
   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where the
borders of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey meet.

   Authorities in the southern Chinese province of
Guangdong seized 792 pounds of opium and heroin and arrested
several gangsters involved in drug smuggling, the pro-Beijing
newspaper Wen Wei Po reported Saturday.
   The newpaper did not say how many people were arrested but said
the gang had more than 80 members who have been dealing in drugs
since 1985.
   It said the gang transported the drugs from the Golden Triangle
area of Vietnam, Burma and Thailand to the southern Chinese
province of Yunnan and Guangdong and then to the British colony of
Hong Kong.
   The operation was directed by a Hong Kong man identified only as
Chan X Kwong, the newspaper said, but it did not say if Chan was
among those arrested.
   It said Chan directed the drug smuggling operation with a walkie
talkie from a house in suburban Canton, the capital of Guangdong
province.
   A truck modified in Hong Kong transported 264 pounds of the
drugs through the Chinese Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen into
neighboring Hong Kong, the paper said.
   The gang members fought among themselves and Chan reportedly
tried to rob his partner Ah Wing last year, the paper said.
   Hong Kong police said they have not heard of the gang.

<TEXT>
   The Marxist government imposed huge
price inceases on food, and a government newspaper said Saturday
that the increases were necessitated by a guerrilla war that has
ravaged the economy.
   Prices for rice, sugar, corn, cooking oil, bread and soap all
rose sharply under government-mandated increases that took effect
Friday in the southern African nation. In a bid to offset the
higher food prices, the government also granted wage increases to
some workers.
   Rice went from 9 cents to 60 cents per kilogram, about 2.2
pounds. Corn flour rose from nine cents to 32 cents per kilogram
and a kilogram of sugar went from 11 cents to 59 cents.
   The minimum wage for an industrial worker has been raised from
about $17 a month to $29 per month. However, raises were not
granted to workers in factories that were losing money.
   Mozambique also has a high unemployment rate and thousands of
refugees displaced by a war raging since the 1960s. Mozambique won
independence from Portugal in 1975 after years of fighting. Since
then guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance have been
battling to oust the Marxist government.
   The daily newspaper Noticias, in an editorial Saturday, blamed
the country's economic woes on ``the continued and systematic
aggression against Mozambique, carried out by the racist regimes of
the region _ first Rhodesia and later South Africa.''
   In the mid-1970s, then white-ruled Rhodesia helped backed the
anti-Marxist guerrillas. After Rhodesia became black-ruled Zimbabwe
in 1980, South Africa began supplying the rebels.
   South Africa and Mozambique signed a mutual non-aggression pact
in 1984, but both sides regularly accuse the other of violations.
   Noticias said foreign support of the rebels has destabilized
Mozambique and ``has prevented us from consolidating our
independence and developing our economy.''
   ``Mozambique, devastated by more than 20 consecutive years of
war, is currently one of the poorest countries in the world,''
Noticias said. ``The state can no longer go on paying food
subsidies.''
   An estimated 5 million of Mozambique's 14.5 million people are
in need of food aid.
   In other developments, government troops killed 38 rebel
fighters in clashes during the past week in three separate
provinces, the national news agency AIM said.
   The rebels were killed in clashes from March 29-31 in the
central provinces of Sofala and Zambazia and the northwestern
province of Tete, AIM said, citing a report on Radio Mozambique.
   The report made no mention of government troop casualties.

   Soviet officials negotiating with the United
States on halving nuclear arsenals no longer believe they will have
an agreement to sign by the time President Reagan visits next
month, well-placed Soviet sources say.
   The ruling Politburo officially remains determined ``to work
intensively for the speediest drafting of a set of documents'' to
have them ready for signing at the Moscow summit. But Soviet
officials said privately they do not sense a similar urgency on the
American side.
   Reagan is scheduled to meet Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in Moscow May 29 to June 2 at the fourth U.S.-Soviet summit since
Gorbachev came to power three years ago.
   One source familiar with the negotiations said the United States
still has not responded directly to four specific proposals
Gorbachev put forward at his last meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz in February.
   ``They don't appear to be in a position to make decisions at
this point,'' the analyst said of the American negotiators.
   Speaking on condition he not be identified, the source said
there are ``major, substantive issues'' outstanding on how to cut
both sides' strategic arsenals by 50 percent even before
consideration of the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program for a space-based
shield against nuclear attack. Disputes over that program have
blocked agreement in the past.
   The concept of a 50 percent cut has been accepted by both sides,
but the issue is complicated by the differing numbers and types of
weapons in each side's arsenals.
   The source said the two sides remain far apart on how to reduce
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, which make up an
important element of the Soviet arsenal, and on cuts in
sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Chief U.S. arms negotiator Max Kampelman acknowledged
differences in those areas as well as others in testifying before
Congress last week.
   A Western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the United States is pressing for a ban on mobile ICBMs such
as the Soviet SS-25 because it would be too difficult if not
impossible to verify the number of such weapons remaining in the
Soviet arsenal after an agreed-upon number had been destroyed.
   The Soviets, the diplomat said, are pressing to include
sea-launched cruise missiles in any agreement, but U.S. negotiators
contend they should be left out because no acceptable verifications
measures exist to ensure compliance.
   A Soviet source said, and the diplomat confirmed, that the
Soviets have proposed a joint project to test a verification
procedure using airborne electronic sensors. U.S. negotiators have
expressed doubts such sensors could tell one nuclear weapon from
another or from a ship's nuclear reactor.
   ``We proposed a way to verify sea-launched weapons,'' a Soviet
official said. ``They told us they didn't think it would work. But
they haven't come up with any other plan.''
   Another Soviet analyst in the Communist Party apparatus said he
suspects the U.S. side has concluded the Soviets are so anxious for
an agreement that the Reagan administration can gain more
concessions by holding out longer.
   Kampelman said the United States is still trying to conclude an
agreement before the summit. But he, too, was skeptical.
   ``Achievement of a treaty in that time frame is possible, but it
will be difficult given the number and complexity of issues which
remain unresolved,'' Kampelman said.

   Bombs planted by the Afghan intelligence
agency, created and run by the Soviet KGB, have killed more than
400 civilians in Pakistan, according to U.S. and Pakistani
officials.
   Pakistan has balked at signing a United Nations-brokered deal
calling for an end to covert U.S. aid to Afghan guerrillas at the
same time that Moscow stops aiding the the Kabul regime.
   ``The bombings definitely have people worried. They are designed
to get Pakistan to sign the Geneva agreement. But the government
has stuck to its position,'' said a Pakistani official. He, like
U.S. intelligence sources interviewed about the bombings, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Afghan Ministry for State Security, or WAD, ``is a mirror
image of the KGB,'' combining domestic and foreign intelligence
activities with military functions, said one U.S. intelligence
analyst.
   A State Department report issued last year said WAD had 20,000
agents, although some U.S. and Pakistani officials put the number
at 30,000. WAD has its own uniformed military units and assigns
officers to regular military units to bolster discipline, according
to the State Department.
   WAD has 1,500 advisers from the KGB, which has run it since
since shortly after the coup that brought Marxists to power in
April 1978, the sources said.
   The most recent terrorist episode was last Thursday, when a bomb
exploded in a poultry shop near the Afghan border, killing seven
people and injuring 18.
   The bloodiest incident was last July 14, when three car bombs
exploded at the main bazaar of Karachi, the largest city in
Pakistan, killing 72 and injuring 260.
   WAD staged about a dozen bombings inside Pakistan in 1985, 20 in
1986, and more than 100 in 1987, said a second U.S. analyst. ``They
are continuing at about the same rate this year.''
   Among recent bombings attributed to WAD:
   _Feb. 22, one person was killed and two others were hurt by a
bomb in a popular hotel in Bajaur in the Northwest Frontier
Province.
   _Feb. 23, a boy was killed by a bomb in his home in Bajaur. The
same day, another bomb destroyed a shop owned by an Afghan refugee
in the city.
   _Feb. 27, five people were killed and 11 injured by a bomb in a
motorcycle in a in the main bazaar in Thal, a refugee center in the
Northwest Frontier Province.
   _March 1, two people were killed and two others were injured
when a bomb exploded in Peshawar, a city in northern Pakistan
crowded with Afghan refugees.
   _March 18, a letterbox exploded at a bus station, in Rawalpindi,
setting fire to an empty bus.
   _March 25, nine people were injured, one critically, by a bomb
at a bus stand in Rawalpindi.
   Diplomats at the Afghan Embassy in Washington declined to
comment on WAD or any other subject.
   The bombings started in 1985, about when Mikhail S. Gorbachev
became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, and the
current Afghan leader, known by the single name of Najibullah, left
the Afghan intelligence agency to become secretary in the ruling
party, say U.S. and Pakistani sources.
   Najibullah, trained as a physician in Kabul, became party leader
in 1986 and head of state last year. Col. Geb. Ghulam Farouq Yaqubi
now runs WAD, which until last year was known as the Committee for
State Security, or KHAD.
   ``Clearly, sometime in 1985, Moscow decided it had to increase
pressure on Pakistan, and began cross-border air raids'' in Afghan
warplanes piloted by Soviets and Afghans, said one U.S. government
source.
   But the air raids ``backfired,'' said the source. The United
States came very close to selling Pakistan high-technology Airborne
Warning and Control (AWACs) planes to track the intruders, a sale
that was opposed by India, a friend of the Soviet Union and an
enemy of Pakistan.
   Instead, WAD ``stepped up the terror bombing, and there hasn't
been so much of a reaction,'' said the source.
   The initial bombings were aimed at the 3 million Afghan refugees
who live just inside Pakistan, crossing the border to wage their
guerrilla war against the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops backing
the Kabul regime.
   The campaign became more serious, said a Pakistani official,
when the bombs began to explode in major cities like Islamabad,
Rawalpindi and Lahore, far from the refugees, deep in the heart of
Pakistan.
   Afghan intelligence, under Soviet tutelage, recruits agents to
plant the bombs, which analysts describe as ``crude,'' and
consisting in part of Soviet-made components.
   ``We have arrested a lot of these guys, and they say they are
paid by the Kabul government,'' said the Pakistani official. ``They
include Pakistanis and Afghans,'' who are drawn from the same
ethnic groups and cross the border easily, he said.
   For each bombing, they are paid several hundred dollars, ``a
huge amount of money'' in such an impoverished area, said the
official. ``For killing, they get more.''

<DATELINE>SAN MIGUELITO, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the best of times, which these
are not, life was no cinch in San Miguelito.
   But a general strike aimed at overthrowing the regime of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega closed Panama's banks and much of its
business and sent the poor suburb's unemployment even higher. The
few who have jobs often can't cash their checks to buy food because
of government-ordered banks closures and U.S. financial sanctions.
   Better-off Panamanians had cash at home or were able to withdraw
some before the banks closed, and by buying only essentials they
are managing to get by.
   But in the hillside shacks of San Miguelito, that option didn't
exist.
   Hunger spread so rapidly that the parish churches, which were
distributing food, have had to pass the job to Caritas, a Roman
Catholic relief organization, and content themselves with trying to
catalogue the soaring need.
   ``They are giving out 3,500 meals a day in my parish,'' said the
Rev. Reynaldo Karamanites, who heads the Samaria parish in San
Miguelito. Three days earlier, he said, the number was 2,800.
   ``In 1980, there were about 80,000 people in the parish and
44,000 were unemployed,'' he said. ``Add at least 30 percent to the
unemployment figure now.''
   ``Unemployment always has been bad,'' said the Rev. Jorge
Altafulla of the slightly less impoverished San Miguelito parish of
Christ the Redeemer. ``A lot of people here had only occasional day
work and now they have lost even that.''
   Caritas is feeding about 9,000 families in the province of
Panama, which includes the capital, and the number is soaring. Most
of the 9,000 are in San Miguelito.
   The Caritas food is donated or bought with donated money.
   ``We keep praying that people will give more food and money,''
said the Rev. Laurino Duran, who heads Caritas in the Panama City
area.
   He said donations are meeting the present need but worried about
the near future.
   ``We've received nothing from the government,'' said Ursinis de
Castillo, who helped dish out cooked rice and scrambled eggs to
residents of Sector 28, where she lives in Christ the Redeemer
parish. ``All we have is the church and our community.''
   ``Some people from the government were here with 100 bags of
food to sell to government workers,'' said one man. ``They charged
$15.60.''
   ``Yesterday, (Caritas) brought rice with chicken,'' said Soia de
Aguilar, who was waiting for food. ``They try to see that everybody
has enough, but each family gets the same and some families have
eight or nine members.''
   Caritas started giving food to churches to distribute starting
in early March after banks closed because a political crisis had
sparked panic among depositors.
   On March 3, the United States froze Panamanian funds in American
banks, one of several steps intended to force Noriega from power.
Noriega, head of Panama's armed forces and the power behind the
civilian government, is under indictment on drug trafficking
charges in the United States. The freezing of funds deprived Panama
of its supply of dollars, the official Panamanian currency, and on
March 4 Noriega ordered the banks to remain closed.
   The churches stopped trying to hand out the Caritas packages
last week when the crowds got too big too fast, and now the food is
brought to central distribution points, cooked over wood fires and
distributed to the list of the neediest compiled by the church.
   Even if banks were to reopen, they are critically short of
dollars because of the American freeze. The government has been
unable to pay most of its 130,000 employees, and the banks likely
would have trouble producing dollars to cover checks waiting to be
cashed.
   Generally, stores insist on cash and will not take checks or
credit cards.
   Caritas officials say it now requires about $600,000 in
donations a month to keep the people it feeds supplied with basics
such as rice, beans, cooking oil and powdered milk. In Sector 28, a
Caritas worker said the list of families deemed eligible is growing
by five or six families a day and that the increase is higher in
other areas.
   ``A few people here worked for the government, a few had other
jobs, all sorts of jobs,'' said Mrs. de Aguilar. ``That's San
Miguelito. We do a little of everything and a lot of nothing.''

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand and politicians from
France's left and right put aside their quarrels Saturday and paid
their last respects to Edgar Faure, one of the most widely
respected statesmen of the century.
   Faure, a brilliant and witty politician who in four decades of
service occupied nearly every important French government post
except president, died Wednesday at the age of 79.
   The ceremony at Paris' St. Clotilde Basilica was simple. Faure's
plain coffin was draped with the French Tricolor. Upon it was
placed the bicorn hat and sword of the Academie Francaise, of which
he was a member.
   Mgr. Daniel Pezeril, former auxiliary bishop of Paris,
represented Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger in conducting the service.
In his brief homily, Pezeril noted Faure's long fight for human
rights, saying he believed such a fight was a ``touchstone of
political responsibility.''
   ``As a Christian, the deceased will have thus participated in
the fate of the world,'' he said.
   Also attending were Bernadette Chirac, representing her husband,
Premier Jacques Chirac, who was on a trip to the French Antilles;
former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing; Jacques Chaban-Delmas,
president of the National Assembly; Alain Poher, president of the
Senate; Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and other present and
former leaders and opposition members.
   Faure was known for his oratorial skills and his ability to
advance policies that went beyond the traditional right-left
cleavage in French politics.
   Although he was a member of several Socialist governments in the
Fourth Republic, he was widely respected by all.
   His last post was as head of the bicentennial commemoration of
the French Revolution, which occurs next year.

<HEAD>Big Bucks for Corn and Bean Research Snag Trade Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to wrap up farm provisions of the
1,000-page trade bill are snagged over a plan by Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, to pump $75 million a year into crop research every year
for 20 years.
   The plan is designed principally to spur demand for corn and
soybeans by finding new, non-food uses for them, leading to higher
farm earnings. ``It's really a long-term agricultural bill, an
investment in the future,'' press secretary Pam McKinney says.
   Thus far, House negotiators on the trade bill aren't so sure.
   The plan would be a boon for Iowa State University and similar
research centers but could whet other lawmakers' appetites for more
of the same for the folks back in their own states.
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, E. ``Kika'' de
la Garza, D-Texas, has been cool toward the notion thus far. And
for that reason farm lawmakers were still wrangling late in the
week, when most other conferees on the trade bill had reached
tentative agreement.
   It now appears unlikely that the matter will be resolved until
after April 11, when Congress returns from its spring break.
   As big as it is, the plant research provision is small potatoes
compared to some of the subsidy programs that do have tentative
approval from the trade conferees.
   Chief among them is a so-called ``triggered marketing loan''
program, similar to export subsidies contained in the 1985 farm
law, that sent U.S. cotton and rice exports skyrocketing _ but at a
hefty price to taxpayers.
   The latest proposal focuses on the Reagan administration's goal
of using the current Uruguay Round of trade talks to start the
United States and its trading partners on a course of phasing out
all agricultural subsidies.
   Failure to make ``substantial progress'' on such an agreement by
1990 would trigger the estimated $500 million marketing loan
program designed to boost exports of wheat, feed grains and oilseed
crops.
   Soybean farmers have been clamoring for a marketing loan
program, under which producers receive price-support loans from the
government as usual, pay them off at the lower, world price of the
crop and pocket the difference.
   Even if Uruguay Round talks bogged down, the next president
could refuse to put the 1990 marketing loan into effect if he were
prepared to assure Congress that the subsidy program would would
harm the international negotiations.
   Doing that, however, would trigger one of the trade package's
most expensive and complex features _ an offshoot of the 1985
Export Enhancement Program, which has sent millions of dollars in
government-owned surplus crops to private exporters.
   Big grain companies and other exporting firms receive the
surplus crops as bonuses to spur overseas shipments of American
farm products.
   The program remains in effect and the trade proposal would
extend it through 1990 and boost the price tag from $1.5 billion to
$2.5 billion.
   A presidential waiver of the marketing loan would automatically
trigger a new export program, requiring the government to pay out
no less than $2 billion in additional surplus-crop bonuses. These
bonuses represent a heavy cost to taxpayers because the commodities
were acquired mainly through unredeemed price-support loans to
farmers.

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. leans over a balcony railing at The
Lorraine Motel. The crack of a single shot from a high-powered
rifle shatters the air.
   Suddenly, he's gone.
   This much is clearly documented. But who killed the 39-year-old
civil rights leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize?
   James Earl Ray, the small-time thief who pleaded guilty, has
spent the past 20 years trying to prove he didn't do it. He talks
of a shadowy ``Raoul.''
   Other principals in the case hold widely varying opinions: Ray's
attorneys disagree on whether he was the triggerman; the prosecutor
acknowledges he wasn't confident about the case; U.S. Rep. Louis
Stokes, D-Ohio, the chairman of a congressional committee that
studied the assassination, says he still concurs with the
committee's findings that Ray may have been part of a larger,
unsolved conspiracy.
   The questions remain. What of the cigarette butts found in the
getaway car _ given that Ray did not smoke? What of the clothing in
two sizes in the car's trunk?
   The fatal shot came from a communal bathroom at the rear of a
flophouse across a narrow street from The Lorraine Motel. Ray
maintains he was not in that bathroom when the shot was fired.
   ``I was a few blocks away, trying to get a tire fixed on my
car,'' he said in a recent interview with The Associated Press at
Brushy Mountain State Prison, where he is serving a 99-year
sentence. ``When I started back to my room I saw a police roadblock
had been set up; it was about that time that I heard on my car
radio King had been shot and the police were looking for a man in a
white Mustang, the same kind of car I was driving, so I took off
for Atlanta.''
   Ray, who had checked into the rooming house the day King was
killed, said he was in Memphis to take part in an illicit
gun-running scheme. He said the scheme was concocted by a mystery
man named Raoul, an international smuggler whom Ray contends he met
several months earlier at a waterfront bar in Montreal.
   He also says Raoul, whom he describes as a blond man with a
Latin American accent, set him up to be framed for King's murder.
   ``The fact is I don't know who killed King,'' said Ray, who
recently turned 60. ``I only pleaded guilty because I was
desperate. I had been in isolation for eight months in the Memphis
jail, and Percy Foreman was pressuring me to cop a plea. He was
telling me my family would get in trouble and I'd get the death
penalty if I didn't do what he said.''
   Foreman, the Houston attorney who represented Ray when he
entered his guilty plea March 10, 1969, angrily disputes these
assertions.
   ``The s.o.b. got down on his knees and thanked me for saving his
life when I told him I had gotten the prosecutor to go along with a
guilty plea,'' Foreman said when contacted in Houston recently.
   Foreman, now in his mid-80s, says he thinks Ray was extremely
fortunate not to have stood trial. He also rejects Ray's story
about Raoul. ``I think he acted alone,'' he said.
   Asked what might have motivated Ray to commit such an act,
Foreman said, ``It was racism. His conversations simply steamed
with racist remarks.''
   Ray, who was a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary at
the time King was killed, denies he harbored any ill will toward
King and defies anyone to prove otherwise.
   ``King was just another politician to me,'' he said. ``Why would
I want to do something like kill a big-shot politician, me a
fugitive, and bring all that heat down on myself?''
   He admits buying the rifle, a Remington Gamemaster, 30.06
caliber, that authorities say was the murder weapon. But he says he
bought, at a Birmingham, Ala., gun shop, at Raoul's instruction and
with money provided by Raoul.
   ``I gave the rifle to Raoul,'' Ray said. ``If I had been buying
it to kill King, you can bet I wouldn't have bought it at a gun
shop. I would have gotten it from a fence, so it couldn't have been
traced.''
   Birmingham lawyer Arthur Hanes Sr. said he tends to believe that
story. He represented Ray for four months before Foreman.
   ``I've never believed Ray shot King,'' said Hanes, a former FBI
agent and one-time Birmingham mayor. ``I personally stood in that
flophouse bathroom and looked across to the motel balcony where the
Rev. King was standing when he was shot. It was a difficult angle.
Ray simply didn't have enough expertise with rifles to make a shot
like that, in my opinion.''
   Hanes also said he had never heard Ray utter a single racist
statement.
   ``I've given this case a lot of thought, and I've concluded
someone assisted Ray,'' he added, ``but I can't say who.''
   The case should have gone to trial, he said, ``to clear the air,
if nothing else. I tried to get the judge to try the case, but he
said there was too much pressure, from the government and the
Memphis business community, to accept a guilty plea and avoid the
publicity that a trial would generate.''
   The judge, W. Preston Battle, died a week after Ray's guilty
plea. However, the chief prosecutor, Philip Canale, acknowledged
last week that, contrary to Foreman's assertion, he had been happy
to get a plea from Ray.
   ``It would have been a big, time-consuming and expensive trial
with dozens and dozens of witnesses from all over the country,''
said Canale, now an assistant U.S. Attorney in Memphis. ``I have
never regretted the guilty plea because we got a substantial
sentence. Also, I didn't want to take a chance on getting a cranky
juror and having a mistrial.''

   Canale added that although he had no eyewitness and the evidence
against Ray was largely circumstantial, he doesn't buy the
conspiracy theory.
   ``I think he acted alone,'' he said, noting that the FBI had
found Ray's fingerprint on the rifle discarded by the gunman near
the scene of the crime.
   However, supporters of Ray's story say his fingerprint was on
the rifle because he had purchased it. They also note that, while
Ray is a lifelong non-smoker, Viceroy cigarette butts were found in
the rooming house bathroom and in his car ashtray, and that two
sizes of clothing were found in his trunk.
   Ray said the fact that Raoul often used his car may explain the
butts in the ashtray and clothes in the trunk. ``As for cigarettes
in the bathroom I can't say because I was never in that bathroom,''
he said. ``My prints were never found in there, you know.''
   Then there were the two white Mustangs. The late Guy Canipe,
whose amusement company was located next door to the flophouse,
told investigators he saw a fleeing man ditch a rifle and a small
overnight bag in front of his store and then drive away in a white
Mustang, one of two that had been parked in front of the store that
afternoon. He described the man as having dark hair and a beard.
   Ray, who was captured in London two months after King's death,
says the fact that the gunman ditched the rifle and his bag _ which
Ray says he had left in his room when he went to get the tire fixed
_ shows somebody was trying to frame him.
   ``Why would I have dumped my stuff there for the police to find
when all I had to do was put it in the car and drive away?'' he
asked.
   After two years of hearings, ending in 1978, the House Select
Committee on Assassinations couldn't answer that question. The
committee issued a report saying Ray probably had been part of a
larger conspiracy.
   But while the committee couldn't say who else had participated
in the plot, it did exonerate the CIA and FBI, both of which had
conducted extensive illegal surveillance and smear campaigns
against King throughout the 1960s. Former FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover was known to have hated King.
   FBI agents testified that no evidence could be found of
conspiracies involving the Mafia, Ku Klux Klan or foreign
communists.
   Some of King's friends, however, still feel that letting
Hoover's FBI investigate King's assassination was like letting a
hungry fox guard a henhouse.
   ``I have no proof but I feel in my heart that the government,
probably the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover, and perhaps the CIA, were
involved,'' says the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who was with King
when he died in a Memphis hospital an hour after the shooting.
   ``It's just a pity but, given the way things were back then,
we'll probably never know the whole truth about one of the greatest
tragedies of our time.''

<HEAD>Sixty-two Drug Traffickers Hanged In Malaysia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one-third of the 185 drug
traffickers sentenced to death in Malaysia since 1975 have been
hanged, a Malaysian official said Saturday.
   Idris Ibrahim, who is deputy president of a Malaysian anti-drug
organization, said 62 people had been hanged and another 109 were
awaiting decisions on their death-sentence appeals.
   Idris did not comment on the status of the remaining 14 people
on death row. He did say, however, that 299 people were serving
life imprisonment.
   In 1975, Malaysia passed a law under which convicted drug
traffickers received a death sentence or life imprisonment. In
1983, Parliament amended the law, mandating the death sentence for
traffickers.
   On July 7, 1986, two Australians convicted of heroin trafficking
became the first whites to be hanged in Malaysia.
   Malaysian officials have said about 500,000 of the country's 15
million people are drug addicts.

<HEAD>Time Change Means More Than Lost Hour Of Sleep</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the clock jumps forward an hour for
daylight-saving time at 2 a.m. Sunday morning, it means a little
more than a lost hour of sleep.
   ``People's stomachs will be telling them `Snickers bar' and
we'll be serving lunch. But if you're an early eater, it'll be
beneficial,'' said Jeff Manzer, manager of the Chattanooga
Riverboat Company.
   The firm plans to serve an Easter brunch on the Tennessee river
Sunday afternoon, but the time change ``will probably affect
people's appetites,'' said Manzer.
   Businesses and services that work on into the night lost an hour
_ or gained an hour, depending on the point of view.
   Some police officers who work the night shift get to go home an
hour early. They don't lose an hour's pay for their ``early''
departure. And when the time changes back in the fall, they'll get
an hour's overtime pay, officials said Friday.
   Firefighters who work 24-hour shifts are in the same situation.
   Some churches will hold additional services for sleepyheads and
for the holiday crowds.
   Going visiting for Easter? The nation's public transportation
system is ready for the switch, said Fred Waymack, manager of a
Nashville travel agency.
   ``At some points there are some minor changes in schedules, but
for most airlines, cruise ships and trains, it's just another day
on the job,'' Waymack said.
   Most of the schedule changes come about because of the season,
not daylight-saving time, he said. Some flight times might be
adjusted one or two minutes because of changes in headwinds,
Waymack said, and others might be changed to accommodate peak
passenger loads.
   ``It's really a very sophisticated system,'' Waymack said.
``They've had a number of years since the Wright brothers to
perfect it.''
   But he urged passengers to double-check departures 24 hours in
advance.
   At First Tennessee Bank in Memphis, spokesman Bob Young said the
time change would have little effect on most banking services.
However, he said, there might be a moment's hesitation when
computer operators key in the commands to switch times on the
banking computers, automated tellers and other equipment.
   ``It just depends on how quickly an operator can enter it in,''
Young said.
   Recorded time and temperature announcements must be changed,
along with signs at banks, shopping malls and stores. Teresa
Birdsong, assistant to the general manager at Nashville's WYHY-FM,
said she will have to come to the station at 2 a.m. Sunday morning
to make the change in the time and temperature announcement
computer.
   Bank and store signs are also changed by computer, usually by
the owner of the sign, said Mark Allison, owner of Allison Sales
and Marketing.
   ``The time works off an internal clock, which you reset just as
you would a digital clock,'' Allison said.
   Time clocks must also be changed before workers punch in Monday
morning. Most computerized time clocks will make the change
automatically, but there will still be thousands of older models
that need to be changed by hand, said Southern Time Services
technician Bill Asplint.
   ``We could be doing daylight-saving time changes for the next
two weeks,'' he said.
   This is the second year that daylight-saving time will begin on
the first Sunday in April. Before Congress changed the law, the
time switch occurred on the last Sunday of April.

<HEAD>Official, Dissident Sources Say Ethnic Situation Quieter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikes, demonstrations and tensions between
national groups in two southern Soviet republics have quieted but
economic damage from the unrest is severe, newspapers reported
Saturday.
   Official and dissident sources said the atmosphere in the
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan was improving. But in Moscow,
activist Sergei Grigoryants said ethnic relations remained volatile.
   At a news conference at his north Moscow apartment, the
half-Armenian former political prisoner said he had spoken with
sources in Armenia who told him tensions have eased there and in
the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in neighboring Azerbaijan.
   However, he said he was told some residents of Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, remained on strike.
   Armenian activists want Nagorno-Karabakh, which is mostly
Armenian, annexed to Armenia. At least 32 people have died in
ethnic violence in the region since late February in bloody clashes
between Azeris and Armenians.
   Grigoryants said the Stepanakert airport had been reopened for
local residents but that frequent document checks were being made
at all roads leading into the region to keep outsiders away.
   Workers in Stepanakert, angered over the Kremlin's failure to
issue a clear decision on appeals to annex the region, have been
staying home for more than a week.
   Official newspapers acknowledged labor unrest continued, but
said more people have been showing up for work. In the beginning,
virtually the entire adult population went out on strike.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda carried an interview with
Armenian scholar Gevorg Garibdzhanyan, who accused the state-run
press of telling a one-sided story about the Nagorno-Karabakh
situation and being too quick to label Armenian activists as
extremists.
   But he also defended the presence of Soviet troops in the
Armenian capital of Yerevan, saying he ``slept peacefully knowing
our soldiers were in the city.''
   It appeared from his comments that the armed security troops
that patrolled the city last month had been reduced.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to the
Caucasus region and telephone contact with the area has been
disrupted.
   The national television news program Vremya reported Friday that
public transport and many major industries in Stepanakert had been
idled by the strikes and urged residents of the area to go back to
work.
   The daily Sovietskaya Rossiya said Saturday that some workers
showed up at major enterprises in the city of Stepanakert on Friday
for the first time in more than a week, although the factories were
still not up to full strength.
   An editor who answered the telephone at the Soviet Karabakh
newspaper in Stepanakert on Saturday said the labor situation was
returning to normal in the city, but declined to give his name or
details.
   Selskaya Zhizn newspaper wrote that state and collective farms
in the troubled region had lost nearly $775,000 by mid-March
because of strikes and demonstrations. Shortages of meat, milk and
eggs have resulted, the newspaper said.
   Even larger losses have been reported in recent days due to the
industrial strikes in Stepanakert, where production and deliveries
ground to a halt over the past week.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the Azerbaijan republic since
1923, although more than three-quarters of the region's 160,000
residents are Armenians. Armenians are predominantly Christian,
while most Azeris are Shiite Moslems.
   The labor situation worsened in Stepanakert in mid-March, when
the Soviet leadership called Armenian agitation for
Nagorno-Karabakh's annexation ``intolerable.''
   While apparently rejecting the bid for reuniting the region with
Armenia, the party and government leadership unveiled a program to
invest $690 million in housing and social services like
Armenian-language schools, literature and broadcasting.

   The FBI and the federal Food and Drug
Administration are probing an incident in which a nurse was blinded
by eye drops contaminated with a caustic chemical.
   ``Her left eye looks like it melted and her right eye looks like
it's covered with white glue,'' said Richard Critchlow, an attorney
for Aerial Van Zee Miller, 34, of Fairfax in Marin County.
   Although the Clear Eyes drops were found to contain a caustic
alkali solution, an FDA spokesman said Friday no recall will be
ordered unless it is found that the incident was not an isolated
case.
   Miller was taken to Marin General Hospital moments after she put
some of the solution into each eye Monday. Critchlow said 80
percent of Miller's left cornea and 60 percent of her right cornea
was destroyed, and doctors do not know if she'll ever recover her
sight.
   Cathy Babington, a spokeswoman for Abbott Laboratories, said
``there has never been a complaint before'' against Clear Eyes.

<HEAD>Shultz Calls Again For Ouster Of Noriega's Ouster</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz insisted
Saturday on the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but
sidestepped a report that he had recommended kidnapping the
Panamanian strongman.
   Shultz predicted he would ``see a little headway'' when he again
takes up his plan for Mideast peace talks next week with Arab and
Israeli leaders. Shultz called on Palestinians to participate in
the negotiations, but he again ruled out talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``Obviously, there are some we won't meet with,'' Shultz said as
he reiterated the 13-year-old U.S. policy of not dealing with the
PLO until it accepts Irael's right to exist.
   Shultz held the news conference after receiving Pope John Paul
II's blessing at the Vatican for his new venture in the Middle East
that begins Sunday evening in Jerusalem. The pope stressed any
accord must respect the ``legitimate rights'' of both Israelis and
Palestinians.
   The Vatican does not have diplomatic relations with Israel nor
does it recognize its control of once-divided Jerusalem, the
Israeli capital.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that Shultz recommended
kidnapping Noriega and fomenting a military coup coordinated with
the Central Intelligence Agency.
   The newspaper also said Shultz and Elliott Abrams, the assistant
secretary of state for Inter-American affairs, suggested landing
more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers to encourage Panamanian military
officers to move against Noriega.
   The proposal was strongly opposed by the CIA and Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who labeled it dangerous and
ill-timed, said the Times, quoting unidentified adniminstration
officials.
   Asked if he made such recommendations, Shultz said ``the
position of the U.S. government is that Noriega should go.
Everybody agrees about that. He's been indicted on drug charges.''
   In a lengthy reply, Shultz said the Panamanian people have
demonstrated they agree with the United States in opposing Noriega.
He said U.S. forces in Panama were being increased to guard the
Panama Canal.
   ``We debate various possible options,'' Shultz said. ``But
basically this is a question of a person who is no longer welcome
in his own country by his own people and he should leave.''
   When another reporter suggested Shultz had not really answered
the question, Shultz showed some irritation and said, ``I never
comment on speculative newspaper articles.''
   Told U.S. officials reportedly had described a kidnapping plot
as harebrained, Shultz said: ``I never comment on particularly
harebrained-type proposals.''
   He also refused to say whether the United States would seek
Noriega's extradition to face criminal charges.
   Shultz and his wife, Helena, are spending a leisurely weekend in
the Italian capital and planned to attend the Pope's Easter Mass in
St. Peter's Square.
   Shultz also held a series of meetings with Italian government
officials.
   He praised Italy for its willingness to host the 72 U.S. F-16
jet fighter planes that Spain is expelling in 1991.
   On the Middle East, Shultz said he had no further word from
Arabs and Israelis on whether they would accept his proposal, but
``we expect to see a little headway.''
   His plan calls for negotiations to begin May 1 on arrangements
for self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians on the Israeli-held
West Bank and in Gaza.
   Israel would deal directly with a joint delegation of Jordan and
Palestinians. In December, negotiations on an overall settlement of
the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute would open, also with Syria's
participation.
   Shultz said he would keep working for peace even if he were
turned down on his second trip to the region in a month.
   ``The problem is there,'' he said. ``Everybody recognizes it.
And the problem isn't going to go away.''
   Shultz said after talking with Arab and Israeli leaders he could
``feel it in my bones there is an answer out there if you can only
find it.''

   Roland Dickey once again is ready to don a
rabbit costume and take some holiday cheer to area hospitals in his
annual spring role as the ``ether bunny.''
   Dickey, 73, first put on the fuzzy suit and long ears when
fellow members of the Loyal Order of Moose asked him to preside
over the club's annual Easter egg hunt.
   ``Then I got the idea that I would like to expand and bring the
bunny into the children's hospital wards,'' Dickey said. Nurses
dubbed him the ``ether bunny'' many years ago after he fainted on
the bunny trail, he said.
   ``I was at Methodist Hospital, walking back to the children's
wards, when I walked past one of the operating rooms,'' Dickey
said. ``Back in those days, they used ether as anesthetic. The
ether got trapped up in that bunny head and out I went.''
   After doing his routine for 41 years, Dickey said he has no
plans to retire.
   ``Everybody asks me, `When are you going to get someone else to
do it?' I want to keep doing it for as long as I can,'' he said.

   Mr. Wolf wasn't taking calls at the Bronx Zoo
Friday.
   Neither did Buffy Lowe, Bob Katz, Bob Boon, Don Key or P.N.
Gwynne. But that didn't stop many April Fools' targets from trying
to return calls to those characters.
   ``They's groaners, I'm telling you,'' Luanne McGrain, a
publicist for the zoo, said Friday. ``We've had a lot of doctors
calling _ `This is Dr. Rosenberg. May I speak to Mr. G. Raffe?'''
   For the second year running, the zoo turned the annual prank
into a brief fund-raiser. Other zoos around the nation use the same
tactics with people are fooled into calling on April Fools' Day.
   The switchboard answered calls Friday with ``NYZS,'' the call
letters of the New York Zoological Society. When callers said they
were returning a call from Mr. Wolf, they were transferred to a
volunteer phone bank.
   ``They say, `Mr. Wolf is being fed right now. You have reached
the Bronx Zoo. Somebody's played a joke on you for April Fools'
Day. But while I have you on the phone, would you care to make a
donation?''' McGrain said.
   ``If they can stop laughing long enough, generally people do
make a pledge.''
   Callers wound up making $4,000 in donations, which New York
Telephone has promised to match.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of dead African desert locusts have shown
up on beaches just outside Rome, the Coast Guard reported Saturday,
prompting concerns some swarms might reach Italy alive.
   Coast Guard officials said winds must have pushed the insects
from Northern Africa toward Italy and that they died in the cold
weather.
   The Italian press expressed concern that warmer weather might
allow future swarms of locusts to survive and thrive. The Rome
daily Il Tempo described the scene on the beach as ``the sign of a
narrowly missed invasion, or worse, of an invasion that lies at the
gates.''
   But experts have said Italy will not be hit by the same invasion
of locusts that has spread over Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and
Libya. Last month, the Rome-based U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization described the insect invasion in North Africa as the
worst in 30 years.

   The Reagan administration has
considered a number of military alternatives to oust Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, but has rejected them, President
Reagan's chief spokesman said today.
   Asked about a flurry of news reports that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz was pushing a bold military or covert move to get
Noreiga out, Fitzwater said the Panamanian problem has presented
``fertile ground for a rich imagination'' about possible solutions.
   ``But the United States' intentions are to protect our citizens
and our assets there,'' he said.
   ``There have been any number of offensive plans raised, but to
this point, they have been rejected,'' he added.
   Reagan, who has started a 10-day Easter vacation at his
mountaintop ranch near here, is closely watching the situation,
Fitzwater said, as the Pentagon prepares to send 1,300 U.S.
military personnel to strengthen the American military presence
there.
   Shortly after Reagan arrived in California Friday, the Defense
Department announced that the additional troops would be deployed,
beginning next week, to improve the security of U.S. military
installations in the troubled country.
   The Reagan administration for weeks has been applying economic
and diplomatic pressure to force Noriega out of power. Noriega has
been indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States on drug
trafficking charges.
   Fitzwater, asked earlier this week if the administration was
considering seizing Noriega, said, ``No.''
   But the spokesman told reporters accompanying Reagan to
California on Air Force One on Friday that the administration was
still ``reviewing options'' aimed at securing Noriegan's departure.
   The Pentagon decision to send additional manpower, many of them
military police officers, came in the wake of a march by Panamanian
troops on a Panama City hotel earlier in the week. During that
incident, several U.S. journalists were detained briefly, and
authorities confiscated videotapes of four U.S. television networks.
   Fitzwater said Reagan would be kept abreast of several matters
while the president and his wife, Nancy, relax at Rancho del Cielo
in the Santa Ynez Mountains.
   ``He'll get daily intelligence updates on world situations,''
the spokesman said. ``He could get special information on three or
four areas of interest. One is Panama, a continuing problem to keep
an eye on.''
   Reagan also will be kept informed of any progress that Shultz
makes as he renews the administration's Middle East peacemaking
efforts with visits to several countries in the region.
   The president also will be briefed on the goings-on in
Nicaragua, where the Marxist Sandinista regime is scheduled to
enter talks with the Contra rebels Tuesday aimed at bringing about
democratic reforms envisioned in a truce agreement signed March 23.
   But the political and governmental crisis in Panama seemed sure
to take much of Reagan's attention.
   Reagan has sought to minimize the possibility of U.S. military
force being used to oust Noriega. Last Monday, for instance, he
told high school students in Vienna, Va., he did not think the
citizens of Panama wanted to see ``the great colossus of the
North'' flex its muscles there.
   But the administration apparently has become increasingly
frustrated as Noriega has survived an array of economic sanctions.
These include the withholding of payments the United States makes
to the Panama Canal Commission under terms of the 1979 treaties
providing for the canal to be gradually turned over to Panama by
the turn of the century.
   In another effort to turn the financial screws on Noriega, the
administration on Thursday announced steps to stop U.S. dollars
from flowing into the Central American nation.
   The administration is concerned that the continuing flow of tax
payments by American corporations with operations in Panama has
served to sustain the existing government headed by Noriega.
   The first family plans a quiet Easter vacation, which lasts
through April 10. Fitzwater said there were no plans for
get-togethers at the ranch by Reagan relatives, and it could not be
learned whether the first couple would leave the mountain to attend
Easter services here _ as they did last year.
   Reagan's lone public outing is an appearance Monday at a
luncheon of some 75 supporters of the Reagan presidential library.
   He is scheduled to make a foreign policy address to a convention
of the National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas, Nev., en
route back to Washington on April 10.

   Mormon Church leaders today urged
followers to love God above worldly success and prepare themselves
for the second coming of Jesus Christ.
   In the opening session of the 158th Annual General Conference of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, leaders said
service to God and love of Christ should be the highest priority of
the faithful.
   ``We should put God ahead of everyone else in our lives,'' said
President Ezra Taft Benson, the 88-year-old spiritual leader of the
6.5 million member church.
   ``When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper
places or drop out of our lives. Our love of God will govern the
claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we
pursue and the order of our priorities,'' Benson said in prepared
remarks.
   The sermon was the first of three scheduled to be delivered by
Benson, who has been convalescing from a heart attack the past six
months. Church spokesman Jerry Cahill said Benson, who served as
secretary of agriculture during the Eisenhower administration,
appeared to be in good health and excellent spirits.
   Benson was one of 22 of the church's general authorities
scheduled to speak during the conference's five sessions. General
authorities are full-time clergy who lead the church under the
direction of the First Presidency, which consists of Benson and
counselors Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson.
   Thousands of lay clergymen and other church members from around
the world have gathered for the two-day conference held in the
Tabernacle on Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City.
   During this morning's opening session, leaders stressed
fundamental church doctrines, such as belief in resurrection and
atonement of Jesus and the importance of missionary work.
   Leaders were expected to announce this afternoon that convert
baptisms reached an all-time high during 1987. Cahill said the
exact figure would not be released prior to the afternoon session,
but said it was about 250,000. He said the church's full-time,
volunteer missionary force also has reached an all-time high of
34,200 men and women.
   Neal A. Maxwell, of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, urged
church members to prepare for Christ's second coming, but said they
should not believe the rapture necessarily is near at hand.
   The Council of the Twelve are second to the First Presidency in
the church hierarchy, and assist in directing the church.
   ``Over the sweep of Christian history, by focusing on a few
prophecies while neglecting others, some believers have prematurely
expected the second coming. Today, while obviously closer to that
great moment, we are in the same danger,'' Maxwell said. ``On the
other hand, smugness is also a real danger.''
   Maxwell noted that a number of Biblical prophecies said to be
precursors of Christ's return already have occurred. Among them, he
said, is the return of the Jewish people to the Holy Land.
   L. Tom Perry, of the Council of the Twelve, said Mormons should
get involved in community affairs and promote honest government,
neighborhood beautification and high educational standards.
   ``Rather than spend time complaining about the direction in
which these institutions are going, we need to exert our influence
in shaping the right direction. A small effort by a few can result
in so much good for all mankind,'' he said.

   An apparent fuel spill stretched about 70
miles down the Ohio River today from near Cincinnati to Louisville,
Ky., according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
   ``At this point it smells like diesel fuel, so we are assuming
it is diesel fuel,'' said Lt. Eric Mosher, with the Coast Guard in
Louisville.
   Mosher said his agency had contacted water companies along the
river and health officials in Louisville.
   ``Our first step is trying to find a source and secure the
source,'' Mosher said.
   ``There is about a 1-foot chop on the river right now. To
contain the oil is almost an impossibility,'' he added.
   Sgt. James Hickerson with the Indiana State Police post in
Sellersburg said investigators had used a helicopter this morning
to track the spill about 70 miles.
   ``It's not thick and heavy all the way, but there are traces of
it. It's heaviest between Madison (in Jefferson County) and Clark
County (across the river from Louisville),'' he said.
   ``We don't know exactly what it is, some kind of petroleum,'' he
said.
   ``One report I got from the (police) radio was that it was in
spots as wide as the river. They say it is a real thin film, but
they don't know if it is a fuel or a chemical,'' said patrolman Tim
Armstrong of the police department in Madison, about halfway
between Cincinnati and Louisville.
   Armstrong said Madison residents began reporting a strong diesel
fuel smell Friday night. He said officials at the Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp. generating plant took a boat out to check the river
and discovered the spill shortly after 6:30 a.m.

<HEAD>Nader Urging Consumer-Postal Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is criticizing
the rise in postage rates and urging consumers to organize and
insist on a voice in postal affairs.
   The new postage rates, including a 3-cent rise in the cost of
mailing a first-class letter, take effect Sunday. It will now cost
25 cents to mail a letter.
   Nader termed the increase a ``harsh blow'' on individuals and
said the Postal Service routinely hears from businesses and
non-profit groups about mail service and rates, but not from the
average consumer.
   Nader's solution is to form a group called Residential Postal
Action.
   ``If we can get 10,000 people to write in, we could escalate
this to something significant,'' he said in a recent telephone
interview.
   ``Clearly, there is a great imbalance of representation,'' Nader
said, and a consumer group ``can help even the scales.''
   The rate hike comes at a time when congressional budget cuts
have forced the Postal Service to curtail window hours and some
collections.
   At the same time, proposals to allow private firms to begin
competing in the delivery of first-class mail have been put forth.
   This combination of factors ``threaten the stability of what was
once a well-regarded public service'' Nader said in a letter to
Postmaster General Anthony Frank. Nader urged Frank to find ways to
cut costs without reducing services.
   He called on interested individuals to write to Residential
Postal Action, P.O. Box 19367, Washington, D.C., 20036.
   The group could be funded through voluntary member
contributions, Nader said.

<HEAD>Pope Gives Blessing to Shultz's Mideast Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II gave his blessing Saturday
to U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz's new Middle East peace
mission and stressed that any settlement must respect the rights of
Israel and the Palestinians.
   Shultz, who is on a three-day visit to Italy, briefed the pope
on his Mideast peace proposals during a 30-minute private audience
in the papal library.
   ``God bless your efforts,'' John Paul told Shultz as the two
posed for pictures with the rest of the American delegation after
the meeting.
   ``I go from here to the Middle East with your blessing to
sustain the effort'' to promote Arab-Israeli peace negotiations,
Shultz responded.
   The American plan calls for Israel to give land to the
Palestinians in exchange for peace.
   Under the plan, negotiations would begin May 1 on arrangements
for self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians on the Israeli-held
West Bank and in Gaza. Israel would deal directly with a joint
delegation made up of Jordanians and Palestinians.
   In December, negotiations on an overall settlement of the
40-year Arab-Israeli dispute would open with Syria's participation.
   The U.S. envoy leaves Sunday for Israel, the first stop on a
trip that will also take him to Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. Shultz visited the region last month but found no consensus
for an agreement.
   Shultz also discussed the Mideast situation with his Vatican
counterpart, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.
   ``Progress comes in small increments,'' Shultz said, holding up
his thumb and index finger close together to stress his point.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope and Shultz have
a ``common preoccupation for international peace,'' and their talks
focused on East-West relations, ``the continuing grave situation''
in the Middle East and developments in Central America.
   The pope ``insisted on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people and on the moral duty to find a solution that also takes
into account the legitimate rights of Israel,'' the spokesman said.
   John Paul voiced ``great interest in the efforts under way for
the search, obligatory for everyone, of a process that opens the
way to solutions acceptable to all,'' Navarro said.
   The pope has spoken frequently in favor of a Palestinian
homeland.
   The Vatican does not have diplomatic relations with Israel.
Vatican officials have cited the Palestinian question, Israel's
unsettled boundaries and the status of Jerusalem as reasons for the
absence of ties.
   The Vatican also does not have diplomatic relations with Jordan.
   At a news conference later in Rome, Shultz declined to give
details of his meeting with the pope. ``It is always an
extraordinary privilege to have the opportunity to talk with his
holiness the pope,'' he said. ``I have benefited greatly from that
audience.''
   Shultz was asked whether in his talks with Vatican and Italian
officials he had urged them to play a role in Mideast peace efforts.
   ``I found very warm support for our efforts and a readiness to
help in any way they can,'' he said.
   Shultz, who is Episcopalian, brought to the Vatican on Saturday
an entourage of 31 people, including his wife, Helena, a Roman
Catholic.
   It was Shultz's third meeting at the Vatican with John Paul. He
and his wife visited the Vatican in 1986 for Easter. The previous
meeting was in December 1982.
   Shultz and his wife planned to attend the pope's Easter Mass in
St. Peter's Square on Sunday morning.

Impeachment</HEAD>

   Democratic acting Gov. Rose Mofford has
walked a tightrope in the nearly two months since Republican Gov.
Evan Mecham was impeached, and from all appearances she has enjoyed
nearly every minute of it.
   ``She's everyone's Auntie Rose,'' said state Rep. Cindy Resnick,
and there's proof in the way children come up without prompting to
hug the tall woman with the white beehive hairdo.
   ``She may not be the kind of technocrat some people want her to
be, but she certainly knows people,'' says Democratic House
Minority Leader Art Hamilton.
   She moved quickly to calm Arizona's troubled political waters
after Mecham was impeached on Feb. 5 and she, as secretary of
state, took his office until he is acquitted or ousted. Her
bipartisan volunteer staff included many who served under Mecham's
predecessor, Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
   With Mecham's fate up in the air pending a Senate verdict on the
House impeachment allegations, plus an upcoming criminal trial and
recall election, Mrs. Mofford has avoided any policy initiatives
beyond indicating a willingness to consider tax hikes that Mecham
opposes.
   Mrs. Mofford did not seek a place on the ballot in the May 17
recall election, but a draft committee gathered enough petition
signatures to put her on anyway and she is the favorite in a
seven-way race.
   A court challenge has been filed arguing that she cannot remain
on the ballot unless she files a financial disclosure report. If
she files that, she could be considered to be actively campaigning
and that, under Arizona law, would mean she would have to resign
both as acting governor and as secretary of state.
   ``God only knows what the future holds for Rose Mofford, but I'm
telling you while I'm sitting up there as acting governor I'm there
to serve you,'' she told a luncheon club in one of her many public
appearances.
   Besides speaking at building dedications, county fairs and
countless luncheons and dinners, she has posed for photos with
school children, cotton farmers, mayors, basketball players,
lawmakers, Annette Funicello and Mickey Mouse. As she goes, she
hands out Mofford pens, address books and watches.
   When she isn't making speeches, she can be found flipping
through her three huge rotary files for the telephone number of
those who are on her list of birthdays or anniversaries that day.
   ``No matter who you want to see, honey, you call me _ I'll
probably know him,'' she tells visitors.
   In her 46 years in state government, many of the roles she's
filled have had little substance, and there are conflicting views
of how well she will do on heavier matters.
   But a statewide poll released by The Phoenix Gazette last week
gave Mrs. Mofford an 81 percent approval rating for her job
performance.
   Mecham is automatically on the ballot unless he is ousted via
impeachment in a vote expected this week. Also on the ballot are
another Democrat, two Republicans and two minor candidates.
   As secretary of state, Mrs. Mofford's duties included such
non-controversial functions as keeping the state's Great Seal,
attesting to official acts of government and handling government
publications.
   The office also keeps records on lobbyists and campaign
financing, and John Anderson, former executive director of the
government watchdog organization Arizona Common Cause, says the
state has done a poor job in that area.
   ``I think they tried real hard,'' he said of Mrs. Mofford and
the secretary of state staff, ``but the system they used for
maintaining any files that I was primarily interested in was not a
good one.''
   Records often were missing and there was no attempt to enforce
or have the state attorney general's office enforce laws against
violations, Anderson says.
   Mrs. Mofford was ``not really interested in the compliance end
of things unless somebody made waves, especially the press,'' he
said.
   Hamilton and other defenders of Mofford note that she had to
contend with a GOP-controlled Legislature and was short-staffed,
and Anderson himself acknowledged that record-keeping improved
somewhat with addition of computers.
   Mrs. Mofford is divorced and has no children. She began her
government career in 1941 as a secretary, and she has worked for or
with 11 of the state's 16 governors. She was appointed assistant
secretary of state in 1955 and secretary of state 22 years later.
She won the post in her own right in 1978, 1982 and 1986, each time
by wide margins.
   Her honeymoon in office is in sharp contrast to Mecham, who
seemingly never had one.
   Mecham became the subject of criticism from the start over
errors, news conferences, appointments, hirings and firings, and
his cancellation of a state Martin Luther King holiday established
by Babbitt.
   Mrs. Mofford has drawn little public criticism in such areas,
and there also has been little stir over her generally having
refused to voice her opinion on major pending bills.
   ``I think Rose is a very capable person,'' said Republican House
Speaker Joe Lane. ``She's been very conciliatory toward me.''
   ``She doesn't offend folks,'' said Hamilton.

   A telephone company has decided to print a
photo of acting Gov. Rose Mofford instead of impeached Gov. Evan
Mecham in an advertisment for Arizona, a spokesman says.
   US West, parent company of Mountain Bell, has been running a
series of full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal highlighting
each of the 14 states in its territory.
   Each ad in the series, which cost $1.4 million and started in
January, includes a picture of the portrayed state's governor and
text provided by the governor. The ads are intended to emphasize
the states' strong points and to encourage business development in
the company's service area.
   The Arizona ad was slated to run early in the series, which
began in January, but was delayed because of circumstances
surrounding Mecham, company officials said in February.
   The state Senate is winding up Mecham's impeachment trial, with
closing arguments scheduled Monday. The first-term Republican also
faces an April 21 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election.
   As secretary of state, Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, became acting
governor after Mecham was impeached by the Arizona House on Feb. 5.
   Now, US West has decided to go ahead with the Arizona ad the
week of April 18, but with a photo of Mrs. Mofford instead of
Mecham, Mountain Bell spokesman Jim Cullison said Friday.
   ``We certainly don't want to offend anyone or step on any toes.
We just went with what will be the reality at that point, which is
that Rose Mofford will be acting governor at that time,'' said
Cullison.

   Father Panik Village, a giant public
housing project once called Bridgeport's ``greatest Christmas
gift,'' has come unwrapped.
   ``The mice run around like they're paying the rent instead of
you,'' said Brenda Johnson, president of the Concerned Tenants of
Father Panik Village.
   People are a problem too. ``They're selling guns like it's the
Old West and they're dealing (drugs) in the open,'' she said.
   The project could lose millions of federal dollars if city
officials don't follow orders to tear parts of it down, partially
reconstruct it, and relocate about 1,300 of the estimated 4,000
residents to other housing in Bridgeport.
   Tenants of the complex claim that some of the 41 three-story
buildings are in such poor shape and crime so pervasive that living
there puts them in peril.
   ``I would say it's one of the worst projects in the country,''
said Tom Sherman, director of the Office of Public Housing in the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``Several years ago the modernization money was not used
properly, and we're afraid the bricks are going to pop off the
buildings and someone could get killed,'' Sherman said in a
telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   ``You just can't have a dump sitting there and that's more or
less what Father Panik is.''
   Father Panik Village began as Yellow Mill Village on Dec. 23,
1939. It was renamed in 1955 in honor of the Rev. Stephen Panik, a
Roman Catholic priest who served as the first chairman of the
Brideport Housing Authority and was considered a Connecticut
pioneer in low-rent housing projects.
   ``For it means perhaps the greatest Christmas gift that ever was
given to the people of Bridgeport _ not a promise, but the
beginning of a reality, fine decent homes for about 5,000 people at
rentals that are well within their means,'' Panik said at a
ceremony in 1939.
   Today the largest housing project in the state's largest city
looks like a battlefield. Gunshots occasionally echo within the
project and drug deals are routinely made on street corners. Walls
are marked with graffiti and the hallways smell of urine.
   At least 90 percent of the residents are single parents with an
average of two children and annual incomes of $5,000 to $10,000.
   The federal government has given the Bridgeport Housing
Authority $36 million to demolish 13 buildings, relocate residents
to new quarters to be created around the city, and rebuild some
units.
   HUD is waiting to see if those directions are carried out before
it makes plans or allocates any more money to improve the rest of
the project.
   Sherman said the BHA has been slow in submitting its plans.
   ``We should have had the application for the demolition by the
end of December and it's not in yet,'' he said. ``We'll give them
an extension, but we're kind of tired of giving them extensions.''
   He said if the city doesn't make progress by April 15, he'll
recommend cancelling the federal grant.
   Clarence Craig, executive director of the BHA, said the agency
is determined to meet its deadlines.
   ``All of the little pieces show we're moving ahead,'' Craig said.
   But so far the authority has located only 10 sites to fit 88
apartments, leaving them short of locations for 251 units that must
be moved in the first phase of the project.
   ``The problem is Bridgeport does not have all of the resources
to do things as quickly and well as HUD would like,'' said U.S.
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``It would be very self-defeating
if HUD punished the residents and city for inadequacies that exist
that we're trying to work out.''
   Meanwhile, tenants of Father Panik are uneasy about the future,
said Johnson, president of the tenants' group.
   Johnson, who has lived in Father Panik for all but two of her 36
years, said that even if it is torn down and rebuilt, crime
problems will linger.
   ``If they don't do something about the security here, it doesn't
matter if they call it mud,'' Johnson said.
   Mayor Thomas W. Bucci said the village is ``one of the city's
most important priorities.''
   ``It is known as being one of the worst housing complexes in the
country and that reputation naturally is associated with the
city,'' Bucci said. ``It's not moving as quickly as we'd like, but
progress is being made.''

   President Reagan today urged
Congress to enhance federal support of scientific research, saying
``we couldn't be where we are'' without such exploration.
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from Reagan's ranch in
the Santa Ynez Mountains, the president said that while spending
for scientific research is 58 percent higher than a decade ago,
after discounting for inflation, this is insufficient.
   He said that since World War II, the United States has won more
Nobel Prizes for science than Europe and Japan combined, and that
this country must not lose its world leadership role.
   He said that scientific research, unlike the construction of
bridges, interstate highways and courthouses, has no local
constituency. But Reagan said the United States cannot let this
political fact of life get in the way of continuing breakthroughs.
   Without such exploration, ``we couldn't be where we are today,''
he said. ``We can travel as far as the eye of our imagination can
see.''

<HEAD>Storm Dumps Snow on Kansas, Oklahoma; Rain Causes Flooding</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to update with Louisiana flooding, death,

   A storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on the Great Plains,
snarling traffic and causing power outages, while heavy rain caused
flooding in which one person drowned and dozens of people had to
evacuate from Kansas to Mississippi.
   Tornadoes touched down in four east Texas towns Friday,
destroying at least two mobile homes, damaging dozens of homes _
some blown off their foundations _ and overturning cars.
   New Orleans and suburban Gretna both got eight inches of rain in
12 hours, the National Weather Service said. Three tornadoes
touched down in nearby Slidell, damaging homes and bn businesses
but causing no injuries, police said.
   About 150 people were evacuated from lowlying subdivisions in
Marrero, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, said Paul
D. Connick, Civil Defense director in Jefferson Parish. One Marrero
woman drowned when her car turned off a flooded street into a
drainage canal, police said.
   In northwest Oklahoma, the storm dropped 22 inches of snow on
Goodwell and about 15 inches on Guymon. The Highway Patrol closed
roads and discouraged travel in the area.
   ``Everyone keeps saying when they come in, `April Fools' Day,'''
said Cindy Mitchell, who called the towering snow drifts outside
her Guymon auto shop a cruel joke.
   ``It's Oklahoma. But even for Oklahoma, it's a little extreme,''
said National Weather Service meteorologist Carl Szatkowski.
   In southwest Kansas, Rolla had 13 inches of snow, Johnson 10
inches and Liberal 6 inches. Most roads were closed west of Garden
City.
   ``There are times when you can't even see across the street,''
said Rayna Brown, a spokeswoman for the Stanton County sheriff's
office in Johnson, Kan.
   ``We have a blizzard, with no electricity and no heat,'' said a
Morton County, Kan., sheriff's dispatcher who refused to give his
name. ``The only thing I've got that works is a telephone.''
   A bus with 39 people aboard slid into a ditch in Syracuse, Kan.,
along with other vehicles on Friday, but no injuries were reported,
authorities said. A motel and high school gymnasium were filled
with stranded travelers.
   Rain-swollen rivers jumped their banks in northeast Oklahoma.
Flooding in Bird Creek forced the evacuation Friday night of about
20 homes and seven businesses in Skiatook.
   Water began spilling over the creek banks around noon Friday and
was rising at a rate of a foot an hour, said Skiatook Police
Officer Paul Floyd. The river was expected to crest today near 26
feet; flood stage is 21 feet.
   About 30 flood victims spent Friday night at a shelter in the
Skiatook Community Building, Red Cross officials said.
   In Chandler, Kan., about seven families were moved out of homes
because of rising water.
   ``They're kind of used to it,'' said Lincoln County Civil
Defense Director Mike Clarkson. ``They just kind of put things up
high on the lower floors and move out for a few hours.''
   Flooding washed two cars off a road in Fort Smith, Ark., where
many roads were closed and cars were nearly submerged.
   Heavy rain also swelled the Amite River in east-central
Louisiana, where minor flooding was expected today.

   A judge who released an 18-year-old suspected car
thief will be seeing the man in court again. This time, the young
man is accused of stealing the judge's car.
   Seattle District Court Judge Philip Y. Killien ruled there was
no compelling reason to hold the teen-ager after he was arrested
for investigation of driving a stolen car.
   The judge decided to release the man, although he had no job and
no permanent address, while police and prosecutors investigated.
The judge's own car was stolen soon afterward.
   Killien said he thought the theft of his car March 22 was
nothing more than a coincidence. He got his car back four days
later.
   Killien was expected to testify against the suspect, who is
charged in two other cases but has not not yet charged in the
judge's case.
   The man is back in King County Jail.

   A state-owned newspaper denied rebel
charges that Burmese government authorities carry out large-scale
drug trafficking.
   Kachin rebel leader Brang Seng last month told foreign
correspondents that his forces overran a military outpost in
Burma's northern Kachin state. He said they captured 180 boxes
filled with 5,016 pounds of opium, which he cited as evidence of
government involvement in drug dealing.
   But the Burmese state-owned Working People's Daily said in its
report, published Wednesday and made available Saturday in Bangkok,
that the rebels found drugs stored for use as court evidence.
   The article went on to accuse the Kachin rebels, one of several
minority groups fighting the central government, of smuggling jade,
heroin and opium to bankroll their activities.
   Burma is the world's largest producer of opium with an
anticipated harvest this season of up to 1,200 tons, officials say.

<TEXT>
   With 23 more deaths reported Saturday,
India's troubled state of Punjab has suffered the bloodiest week
since Sikh rebels first began calling for a separate nation six
years ago.
   Last week's death toll of 120 has prompted calls for imposing a
federal emergency in the northern state and already may have
crippled the government's latest effort to reach a compromise with
militants of the religious minority.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called the appointed governor of
Punjab state, S.S. Ray, and state Police Chief Julius F. Ribiero to
New Delhi on Saturday to plan new initiatives against the violence.
   Ray told reporters that the government would keep up its
``relentless war'' against the Sikh radicals who have been blamed
for more than 630 killings this year.
   The United News of India said Sikh militants shot to death six
people Saturday night in the village of Ragarh in Amritsar
district, adding to the 17 deaths reported since Friday night.
   No new government actions were announced Saturday, but Sikhs in
Punjab expressed fears that Gandhi's goverment would declare an
emergency, severely limiting civil rights and imposing harsh police
rule.
   ``This is an excuse by New Delhi to impose emergency on the
state,'' Darshan Singh Ragi, a Sikh religious leader, said Saturday
at his home near Punjab's capital, Chandigarh. ``The bullet is not
an answer to any problem, either from the militants or New Delhi.''
   At the same time, opposition political leaders and some in
Gandhi's Congress Party demanded action. And three radical groups
issued a statement blaming the latest killings on police agents.
   ``All this is being done to defame the militant Sikh youths in
the eyes of the Sikh masses so that the movement for Khalistan is
weakened,'' said a statement from the radical groups.
   L.K. Advani, leader of the opposition Indian Peoples Party,
demanded in New Delhi that Gandhi impose a security belt along
Punjab's border with Pakistan, believed to be the source of the
AK-47 assault rifles used by the rebels in their latest onslaught.
   Past efforts to seal the porous border, the traditional domain
of smugglers on both sides, have failed.
   Harsh police action, exemplified by the Indian army's raid on
the Sikhs' Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984, has succeeded only in
turning ordinary Sikhs against the government.
   The June 1984 raid to drive radicals from the shrine left more
than 1,200 people dead, most of them Sikhs. Soon afterwards, Sikh
bodyguards killed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was Gandhi's
mother. Sikh radicals began openly demanding an independent
Khalistan _ ``land of the pure'' in the Punjabi language.
   The killings are spiraling despite the Gandhi government's
direct federal rule over Punjab since last May when it invoked
Indian law to dislodge the elected state government of Sikh
moderates.
   In March alone, 272 victims were gunned down, compared to 215
who died in the first three months of last year.
   The latest police reports confirm the pattern of random killings
with the victims both Hindus and Sikhs.
   In the neighboring villages of Tara and Kaler in Gurdaspur
district, two sets of Hindu brothers, in their 60s and 70s, were
shot to death Friday night by four men with AK-47 rifles.
   In Tara, about 30 miles south of Amritsar, all but two of the 50
houses in the village were deserted by families fleeing the
persistent violence.
   Ram Lal, a Hindu, said he and a few other villagers had been
coming during the day to mind their fields and shops. After Friday
night's slayings, he said: ``We will not come back at all. We are
not able to stay here with the terror.''
   Sikhs, whose religion is a mixture of Hinduism and Islam, make
up only 2 percent of India's 800 million population, but they are a
majority in Punjab.
   The radicals argue that only a separate Sikh nation can save the
minority faith from being overwhelmed by the Hindus, who comprise
more than 80 percent of the country's people.
   Ironically, some Sikh sources say the upsurge in killings
results from a new effort by the government to find a compromise
with the militants through Jasbir Singh Rode, a 34-year-old Sikh
preacher.
   Rode was among about 40 Sikhs who were freed in early March
after being imprisoned without trial. He was promptly elected to
the most powerful post in the Sikh faith amid reports his freedom
was part of a government move to compromise with the radicals _ or
divide them.
   Rode has denied there were any conditions to his release, and
the government has not publicly outlined its plans.
   Gandhi was asked in an interview published Saturday in London's
Financial Times why he had decided to release Rode and other
imprisoned Sikhs.
   ``We have tried everything else,'' he replied.

<HEAD>Auto Talks: Few Obstacles Seen to Smooth Contract Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s labor problems, inflamed by the
closing of a Wisconsin plant and the threatened sale of a parts
subsidiary, are not expected to prevent it and the United Auto
Workers from reaching a settlement in contract talks this month.
   Since Chrysler backed down in early March from the planned sale
of its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary, caustic
rhetoric and threats of crippling strikes have been replaced by
silence as negotiators prepare demands and strategies for the
opening of talks April 18.
   The union's demands will be discussed and approved by the
140-member UAW national Chrysler council during a meeting this week
in Kansas City, Mo.
   The talks are likely to be much less dramatic than the unrest
that led to Chrysler's agreement to negotiate early, since the
contract must follow an industry pattern contract established last
fall at Ford Motor Co. and used at General Motors Corp.
   ``The framework should be there, and the readiness to bargain
early should generally be an admission that things will go
smoothly,'' said Harley Shaiken, labor and technology expert at the
University of California at San Diego.
   However, Shaiken added: ``Given all the trauma (at Chrysler) in
recent years, there could be a surprise. There is discontent in
Chrysler plants, a real unease that could come out in this
bargaining.''
   Chrysler's contract covering 59,500 active workers and 8,000 on
layoff expires Sept. 14. The UAW wanted to adapt the three-year
Ford and GM contracts to Chrysler last fall.
   Chrysler, however, didn't agree until it backed off from the
Acustar sale, realizing it had opened a wound that would only
fester if left until the normal mid-July opening of talks.
   Chrysler's workers agreed to concessions in the early 1980s to
help the company survive its brush with bankruptcy.
   Many workers say they are disillusioned because a spirit of
camaraderie, of fighting together, has disappeared now that
Chrysler is in the black and their contributions aren't so keenly
needed or appreciated.
   ``The average auto worker at Chrysler in 1979-81 had no business
assuming they were going to have a job there. But they made it
through beautifully, the company's done very well. To now have to
start worrying about your job is very nerve-wracking,'' said
Michael Luckey, an independent auto industry analyst who has worked
closely with Chrysler.
   Indeed, 5,500 UAW members are to lose their jobs this summer
when Chrysler closes a plant at Kenosha, Wis., that it acquired
last year when it bought American Motors Corp.
   The union and state and local officials protested bitterly when
the plan was revealed, saying Chrysler had promised to operate the
plant for up to three years, but Chrysler insists there was no
agreement and that the market does not justify keeping the
86-year-old factory open.
   Chrysler also appears to want to close at least one assembly
plant not previously announced and possibly more than the six
announced Acustar plants planned for closing the next two ye
   Chrysler also will maintain heavy pressure to produce the most
products with the fewest workers possible, said Chris Cedergren,
industry analyst with J.D. Power and Associates in Agoura Hills,
Calif.
   While vital to all automakers, cost-cutting is crucial at
Chrysler because its sales depend on keeping its prices lower than
GM and Ford, Cedergren said.
   The pattern contract includes these protections for workers:
   _A ban on plant closings.
   _Job security provisions that forbid layoffs unless sales of a
particular product fall and restrict transfer of inside work to
outside suppliers. Workers who otherwise would be laid off because
of subcontracted work or improvements in technology or efficiency
are put into a job bank where they receive most of their regular
pay and often retraining.
   _An agreement for the two sides to study jointly over six months
ways to improve quality and productivity at each plant, preventing
the company from abruptly forcing drastic workplace changes on
plants by threatening to close those whose workers refuse.
   Among potential obstacles to a quick and eventually healing
settlement is what many view as a loophole in the pattern contract.
   Although the pattern contract forbids plant closings, GM has
skirted that obstacle by simply laying off all the workers at a
plant whose product isn't selling well and indefinitely idling the
factory.
   In the Chrysler talks, UAW negotiators are expected to seek a
tighter definition of indefinite idling, a difficult task and one
likely to be resisted by Chrysler, Shaiken said.
   ``It would be difficult to renegotiate the Ford and GM contracts
at Chrysler,'' he said.

   President Reagan voiced fear
Saturday that the United States could slip to a second-rate world
power in technology, saying scientific research is ``an
indispensable investment in America's future.''
   ``We can travel as far as the eye of our imagination can see,''
Reagan said in his weekly radio address to the nation. ``But one
thing is certain: If we don't, others will, and we'll fall behind.''
   ``This is why I've urged Congress to devote more money to
research,'' Reagan said in the speech delivered from his ranch in
the Santa Ynez Mountains near this seaside resort city.
   ``This year, we'll begin work on the great-grandchild of those
particle accelerators that have meant so much to our economic
growth,'' he said. ``It's called the super-conducting
supercollider. And it will harness the galloping technology of
superconductivity so we can explore sub-atomic particles in ways
we've never been able to before.''
   Reagan also said that ``we'll also continue developing the space
station. When it's in orbit, the space station will let us perform
once-impossible experiments in the weightless environment of outer
space, and understand our world and universe better.''
   ``Meanwhile, back on Earth, we will be pursuing breakthroughs in
biotechnology that promise to revolutionize medicine, agriculture
and protection of the environment,'' he said.
   But in his talk, Reagan acknowledged that scientific research is
expensive.
   ``Some say that we can't afford it _ that we're strapped for
cash,'' he said. ``Well, leadership means making hard choices, even
in an election year.''
   Without citing dollars-and-cents figures, Reagan said that
federal spending for scientific research is 58 percent higher than
a decade ago, after discounting for inflation. But he indicated
this is still not enough.
   ``We've put our research budget under a microscope and looked
for quality and cost-effectiveness,'' he said. ``We've put together
the best program for the taxpayers' dollars.
   ``After all, the American tradition of hope is one we can't
afford to forget.
   ``The problem here is that science, unlike a bridge or an
interstate highway or a courthouse, has no local constituency,'' he
said. ``Federal funding for science is in jeopardy because of
budget constraints. That's why it's my duty as president to draw
its importance to your attention and that of Congress.''

<HEAD>Massive Lobster Gets Reprieve From Easter Dinner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 25-pound lobster that nearly became
somebody's Easter dinner has been rescued and will be jetting to
Maine on Monday to live out its old age beneath the Atlantic.
   Publicity forced a seafood company owner, a seafood lover, an
animal-rights group and the Maine Department of Marine Resources
into an unlikely alliance to save the creature, which was estimated
to be between 40 and 125 years old.
   Also saved from the pot was a 19}-pound companion.
   ``This was something that strikes you in your moral craw,'' said
Gloria Felscher-Cohen, vice president of the rights group, Pity Not
Cruelty Inc.
   ``Here is a very old lobster and it just seemed disgusting that
it should end its life to the cruelest predator _ man _ in a pot of
boiling water.''
   The 25-pounder, equipped with claws the size of baseball mitts,
arrived from Boston on March 25 after an order got mixed up at
Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in Ardmore.
   When owner Kevin Hill recovered from his astonishment, he and
his staff dubbed her Shirley. Then he sold her and the other hefty
crustacean to a regular customer, a retired carpenter from
Haverford, for $287.
   But before Shirley was out the door, The Philadelphia Inquirer
ran a story about her, and Hill's phone began ringing with calls
from lobster advocates, including Ms. Felscher-Cohen.
   She told him it would be a ``lovely gesture'' during the
Passover and Easter holidays to celebrate themes of freedom and
resurrection by buying back the lobsters.
   She even offered to top the carpenter's price.
   After several calls like that, Hill was convinced. When the
carpenter came to pick up the second lobster, Hill offered him $387
for both.
   ``His first feeling was `What do you mean they're going to take
the lobsters?''' Hill said.
   ``I said, `Look, there's too many people (calling). Let's free
the things.''
   The customer, Robert Miller, agreed to exchange the large
lobsters for 45 pounds of smaller ones, rather than for money.
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' Miller said. ``What's the
difference between a one-pound lobster and a 25-pound lobster?''
   Pity Not Cruelty, meanwhile, had already made arrangements with
the state of Maine to turn the creatures loose. The group assumed
the flight costs.
   Crated and covered with seaweed, the lobsters are due to fly to
Portland Monday afternoon for a few hours of observation.
   ``If they are healthy, we will liberate them the next day,''
said Lt. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Bureau of Marine Patrol.
   They should be freed off the shore of Cape Elizabeth, by the
Portland Head Light, he said.
   In Maine, he added, it would be illegal to catch Shirley,
because she is much longer than the five-inch maximum (measured
from the rear of the eye socket to the end of the body shell)
allowed by the Maine Department of Natural Resources. The older
lobsters are protected, he said, because they have more offspring.
   His department will probably investigate Shirley's origins, he
said.
   The state helped save a 23{-pound Alaskan lobster from gourmands
last November, he said.
   That lobster ``was very lively,'' he said. ``I'm pretty
optimistic that these will fare as well.''

<HEAD>Restoration Shows How Master Reworked Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restoration work on Rembrandt's ``Danae,'' which
was cut and splashed with acid by an attacker in 1985, has revealed
how the Dutch painter reworked the 17th century masterpiece, the
Tass news agency said Saturday.
   Restoration experts in Leningrad using X-rays, ultraviolet and
infrared light, have completed the first stage of their work and
now are getting ready to retouch the areas where the original paint
was destroyed, the report said.
   A ``case history'' of hundreds of pages has been recorded, Tass
said.
   The painting was damaged June 15, 1985, by what officials
described as a ``madman'' who threw sulphuric acid on it and
slashed it twice with a knife at Leningrad's Hermitage museum.
   Soviet art officials have said the damage was serious, but never
have said specifically how much of the painting was destroyed.
   Restorers, including chemists, biologists, physicists and other
scientists, began work immediately on the canvas. The painting
depicts the mother of Perseus, who, according to Greek legend,
killed Medusa and her head of snakes.
   Soviet art books say Rembrandt painted ``Danae'' in 1636 and
repainted it in 1646-1647.
   ``X-ray studies showed that Rembrandt had repainted the gesture
of the right hand, changed the appearance of the old woman looking
from behind the canopy, that he had painted over Danae's earrings
and beads, and that he had altered her facial features several
times in the course of the work,'' Tass said.
   Experts also established that the 81-inch canvas was actually
two pieces that had been skillfully sewn together, covered first
with a brown primer, a layer of gray and then whiting.
   ``It is our immutable principle not to paint over even a single
millimeter of the author's painting,'' Yevgeny Gerasimov, head of
the restoration effort, told Tass.
   ``Now we are beginning work on those sections where the layer of
paint had been washed off, and advancing from the sides of the
painting to the four epicenters that suffered most from the acid.
We are drawing copies of `Danae' to master Rembrandt's style,'' he
said.
   The experts also tried to restore the painting's lacquer, which
had seriously deteriorated in several places, Tass said.
   The report said experts would not speculate on when restoration
work would be done, but that they were confident the painting would
be displayed once more in the Hermitage when the work is completed.

   Gov. Roy Romer shouldn't have to look for a new
tailor any time soon.
   Thom Payseno offered to make a new overcoat for the governor
after a Denver attorney walked off with Romer's coat. Payseno is
serving a life sentence for murder in state prison.
   The original coat was eventually returned, but Romer said he
accepted Payseno's offer because he believes it is important for
inmates to be able to display their talents.
   Romer showed off the new coat at a news conference at the
Capitol on Friday. The coat is too large because the governor
furnished his measurements before he lost more than 20 pounds on a
diet.
   ``Rather than make the coat fit by gaining the weight back,
we're going to go alter the coat,'' Romer said. ``It's certainly
large enough. It's a nice coat.''

   Ann Landers is better than Dear Abby, but the
two sisters both beat out seven other advice columnists by a wide
margin, The Harris Poll reported Saturday.
   Fifty-one percent of respondents chose for Ann when asked which
of the nine did the best job of writing an advice column.
   ``Ann Landers leads among all regions and major segments of the
public, but is particularly popular in the Midwest, among women,
business executives, as well as blue-collar and white-collar
types,'' wrote pollster Louis Harris.
   ``Dear Abby shows strength in the West, and among less
well-educated and less affluent readers.''
   Abby was first choice for 31 percent, followed by Dr. Joyce
Brothers with 13 percent and Miss Manners with 4 percent.
   Harris said advice columns claim a total of 96 million readers.
Nearly two-thirds of all women are readers, he said. Middle-class
people and those over 50 are among the more avid readers.
   Democrats tend to read the columns more than Republicans, and
political moderates read them more than liberals or conservatives,
Harris found.
   The poll, taken by telephone March 9-13 among a national cross
section of 1,257 voters, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.

   Jeff Brown and Diane Ridley got in
on a bit of 18th-century romance when they married in an old
blacksmith's shop.
   Brown, 28, a landscape designer and part-owner of basketball's
Boston Celtics, and Ridley, 28, came here from Huntsville, Ala., to
be wed by Rev. Adam Barr. The couple met Barr, 21, who lives near
Glasgow, while he was studying in the United States last year.
   ``We wanted to wed in Scotland for a touch of romance but had
never heard of Gretna Green until Adam suggested it,'' Brown said.
``It was a neat idea.''
   Gretna Green became a Mecca for couples in the 18th century when
marriages involving just a declaration of intent before witnesses
were outlawed in England. Runaway couples flocked over the Scottish
border to the first town _ Gretna Green _ and made their
declaration before the blacksmith.
   Marriages by blacksmiths were outlawed in 1940.

   Princess Anne returned to Britain Saturday from a
five-day visit to Australia, smiling cheerfully and looking none
the worse after her fall from a horse.
   The 37-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, an expert
horsewoman, was thrown from her mount at Sydney's Randwick
Racecourse Friday when the horse apparently shied at some running
water on the side of the track.
   In contrast to her fitness, Anne's husband, Mark Phillips, was
hobbling on crutches because of an Achilles tendon injury he
suffered last fall.
   The couple had been in Australia to help celebrate the country's
bicentennial.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's radio address Saturday, as delivered from his ranch in the
Santa Ynez Mountains.
   My fellow Americans, Passover and Easter are festivals of hope.
That's why this weekend is a good time for all of us to reflect on
the enduring importance to mankind of hope and faith in the future,
and nowhere do our hopes take more visible form than in the quest
of science.
   Science has grown, and with it the fascination it holds for all
us. But as the pursuit of science has become ever more nationally
and even multinationally funded, it has also become more expensive.
The problem here is that science, unlike a bridge or an interstate
highway or a courthouse, has no local constituency.
   Today, when we are witnessing some of the most exciting
discoveries in the history of science, things similar to the
breakthroughs associated with Einstein, Gallileo and Newton,
federal funding for science is in jeopardy because of budget
constraints.
   That's why it's my duty as President to draw it's importance to
your attention and that of Congress. American has long been the
world's scientific leader. Over the years, we've secured farm more
patents than any other country in the world. And since World War
II, we have one more Nobel prizes for science than the Europeans
and Japanese combined. We also support more of what is called
``basic research.'' That is, research meant to teach us, rather
than to invent or develop new products. And for the past 40 years
the government has been our leading sponsor of basic research.
   The remarkable thing is that although basic research does not
begin with a particular practical goal, when you look at the
results over the years, it ends up being one of the most practical
things government does. For example, government-sponsored basic
research produced the first laser. Today, less than three decades
later, lasers are used in everything from microsurgery to the
transmission of immense volumes of information and may contribute
to our Strategic Defense Initiative that promises to make ballistic
missiles obsolete.
   When I think that over the past 50 years the government has
helped build a number of particle accelerators so scientists could
study high-energy physics, major industries, including television,
communications and computer industries, couldn't be where they are
today without devlopments that began with this basic research.
   We cannot know where scientific research will lead. The
consequences and spin-offs are unknown and unknowable until they
happen. In research, as Albert Einstein once said, ``Imagination is
more important than knowledge.''
   We can travel wherever the eye of our imagination can see. But
one thing is certain: If we don't explore, others will, and we'll
fall behind. This is why I've urged Congress to devote more money
to research. After taking out inflation, today's government
research expenditures are 58 percent greater than the expenditures
of a decade ago.
   It is an indispensable investment in America's future. Let me
tell you about just a few of the many projects we'll fund this
year. This year, we'll begin work on the great-grandchild of those
particle accelerators that have meant so much to our economic
growth. It's called the super-conducting supercollider, and it will
harness the galloping technology of superconductivity so we can
explore sub-atomic particles in ways we've never been able to
before.
   We'll also continue developing the space station. When it's in
orbit, the space station will let us perform once-impossible
experiments in the weightless and sterile environment of outer
space, and understand our world and universe better. And we're
developing new technology to allow man eventually to journey beyond
earth's orbit.
   Astronaut Sen. Jake Garn and others in Congress have given the
space program the support it needs to once again reach for the
stars. Meanwhile, back on earth, we will be pursuing breakthroughs
in biotechnology that promise to revolutionize medicine,
agriculture and protection of the environment.
   We're working on new ways to spread the seeds of federal
research. Working with universities across the country, we have
established 14 engineering research centers devoted to basic
research on emerging technologies. And we're planning 10 to 15 new
science and technology centers to do the same thing in the fields
of general science.
   All of these centers will work with industry so that what they
discover can quickly lead to new and better and internationally
competitive products. All of this and more is before Congress now.
Some say that we can't afford it, that we're too strapped for cash.
   Well, leadership means making hard choices, even in an election
year. We've put our research budget under a microscope and looked
for quality and cost-effectiveness. We've put together the best
program for the taxpayers' dollars. After all, the American
tradition of hope is one we can't afford to forget.
   Until next week, Happy Easter and Passover. God bless you.

<HEAD>McGovern Warns Against Brokered Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic presidential candidate
George McGovern on Saturday warned Democrats that an attempt to
deny the party's nomination to the front-runner at the convention
could spell defeat in November.
   ``I don't want to see a big, divisive fight at the convention
and a desperate attempt to block the front-runner because I think
that would bring a repeat of 1972,'' McGovern told The Associated
Press.
   McGovern said efforts by some Democrats to block his nomination
despite his delegate lead going into the 1972 Democratic convention
split the party and contributed to his landslide defeat to
then-President Nixon in the general election.
   ``It really cost us heavily. The fallout was devastating,''
McGovern said.
   ``Those last-minute, desperation blocking efforts contributed to
the Democratic defeat in the fall,'' he said. ``We should not
repeat that experience in 1988.''
   McGovern's advice to fall in line behind a front-runner echoes a
similar call by Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk, who also wants
the nomination settled before the convention.
   McGovern said a brokered convention is unnecessary because ``the
voters are the brokers and they are making it clear that Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are the two candidates who command the
most support.''
   ``After the last primary, we should rally around whichever of
these two front-runners has the most delegates,'' he said.
   If Dukakis and Jackson end up in a ``virtual dead heat'' after
all the primaries, then the convention delegates should decide
which will be the candidiate, McGovern said.
   ``But if one of the candidates compiles a significant
first-place win, he is entitled to the nomination,'' McGovern said.
   McGovern said the Democratic race has narrowed to ``a two-man
race now'' between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   He said neither Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee nor Sen. Paul
Simon of Illinois is likely to pull ahead, but he said he was not
suggesting they drop out.
   ``That's a judgment they should make, but I think that if at the
end they come up as short as they are now, they should get behind
the front-runner,'' he said.
   McGovern has not endorsed anyone in the race yet. He said
Jackson ``offers a message of hope and reconciliation'' and Dukakis
``offers a record of experience and competence in government.''
   Democrats should evaluate both ``progressive spirited men'' and
nominate the one with the most delegates, he said.

   Striking ferry sailors voted Saturday to
return to work, ending their 17-day walkout in time to carry Easter
holiday travelers across the English Channel.
   Seamen in the French ports of Calais, Dunkirk and Dieppe voted
to accept an agreement worked out Friday between their unions and
the maritime arm of the state-run railroad. The accord provides for
employment guarantees, better working conditions and higher
salaries for part-time employees.
   The workers were readying three idled ferries to serve Easter
Sunday passengers. They join two British ferries that had been
carrying the backed-up traffic alone.
   But on the British side of the Channel, talks broke down Friday
between ferry workers and P and O European Ferries and a two-month
strike continued.

<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans are complaining that the
Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee hasn't acted quickly
enough on President Reagan's federal judge appointees.
   ``There is no reason, why we can't with a little extra hard
work, hold hearings when necessary and move some of the nominations
presently pending out of this committee,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., said at a recent committee hearing.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who heads the ad hoc subcommittee
that screens candidates, denied there has been any foot-dragging
over nominations. And Leahy told Thurmond in a letter, ``Your
concern is misplaced.''
   Leahy also said there is no truth to a rumor circulating on
Capitol Hill that the Senate would not take up any executive or
judicial nominations if they were not received by Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., by April 1.
   ``I don't know where that rumor came from,'' Leahy said in an
interview. ``Sen. Byrd never told me anything like that. Sen.
Kennedy also told me that he has received no such instructions.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who heads the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, has been running the Judiciary Committee
in the absence of Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., who is at home
recovering from surgery.
   Linda Peek, Byrd's spokeswomen, also said that Byrd had not made
a demand on the Senate's committee chairmen for nominations by
early April.
   Thurmond, backed by other Republicans on the Judiciary panel,
complained about what he called ``the extremely slow pace that the
committee is processing nominations this year.''
   In 1986, he said, the Judiciary Committee received 145
nominations and 139 were confirmed, including two Supreme Court
justices, 11 appeals court judges and 33 district court judges.
That was the last year the Republicans controlled the Senate.
   Thurmond said there are currently 36 judicial nominees waiting
for committee action, five of which are for the appeals court and
21 for the district court.
   Thurmond said some of the nominees have been waiting for nearly
a year for Senate action.
   Others have been waiting months. Specifically, he cited the
nominations of David Treen of Louisiana, which has been pending
eight months, and Stuart Summitt of New York, six months, both for
the appellate court; and Paul Gadola of Michigan, 11 months,
Richard Voorhees of North Carolina, eight months, David Ezra of
Hawaii, four months, Robert Roberto of New York, four months,
Vaughn Walker of California, three months and Howard Levitt of New
York, three months, for the district bench.
   Leahy said Thurmond had written to Biden three times in March
complaining about what he described as ``the extremely slow pace
that the committee is processing nominations so far this year.''
   In a reply, Leahy wrote: ``I believe your concern is misplaced.''
   He said the committee had received nine nominations to the
federal courts this year thus far. He said his committee had
already held hearings on 11 nominations with seven more scheduled.
   ``I can offer you my personal assurance that, as far as I am
concerned, every single judicial nomination that comes before this
committee will be considered fairly, thoroughly, and without any
unjustified delay,'' Leahy wrote. ``I know Joe (Biden) shares this
attitude, and I believe the committee has lived up to this standard
throughout his chairmanship.''

<HEAD>Seminar Examines Ways To Improve College</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study that is looking at ways to help
students enjoy college has found that the happiest students at
Harvard University are athletes.
   The preliminary study also has found that too many students
don't give enough thought to their major and suggests a need for
better advising.
   The results are too new to have been properly interpreted,
cautions Richard F. Light, director of the Harvard Seminar on
Assessment. He suspects athletes are happier because of the social
life inherent in their activity.
   ``Almost by definition anybody in an athletic group has a group
of people they become very good friends with,'' Light said in a
recent interview.
   The seminar is a three-year, $350,000 project funded by private,
federal and college funds. It involves 90 faculty, administrators
and students from Northeastern colleges including Amherst,
Brandeis, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Smith, Williams, MIT and Brown.
   Among the findings halfway through the project, a student at
Wellesley College said she chose a joint major in Middle East and
peace studies after a friend suggested it fit her personality, said
Wellesley professor David Pillemar.
   Another student chose psychobiology the first week of her
freshman year because her mother, leafing through a course
catalogue, thought it sounded interesting.
   ``A lot of people feel an improvement in the overall college
experience may not come from teaching the subject a tiny bit better
but from better advising,'' Light said.
   The researchers also have found that less than half the female
freshmen who entered a science program at Dartmouth, Harvard or
Yale graduated in the field, but they aren't sure yet what that
means, Light said.
   ``One interpretation is that is bad _ we're losing talented
women,'' he said. ``The other is that's great, they're making
choices.''
   The researchers will examine 18 separate areas, including the
effects of part-time work and extra-curricular activities on
student success.
   And at a time when Secretary of Education William J. Bennett has
accused colleges of ``ripping off'' students through poor
instruction, the project will look at different methods of
instruction, ways to improve student writing and student advisory
programs.
   Researchers expect to issue a report this summer.

   Independent counsel James McKay's criminal
investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III has run into
roadblocks because key witnesses have refused to cooperate with the
probe.
   Among those who have erected a wall of silence that McKay has
been unable to penetrate is a central figure in the probe, longtime
Meese friend E. Robert Wallach.
   The attorney general's former financial manager, W. Franklyn
Chinn _ who was introduced to Meese by Wallach _ also isn't talking
to McKay. Chinn and Wallach were indicted in December in the
Wedtech scandal, one of the areas in which Meese has been under
investigation since last May 11.
   Former Wedtech consultant R. Kent London, another indicted in
the Wedtech scandal, also has also refused to talk to McKay.
   The latest figure to stand in the way of McKay's probe is Swiss
oil man Bruce Rappaport. Sources familiar with the probe said he
decided at the last minute not to give a deposition in London,
where he had agreed to meet with McKay's investigators, on
questions of whether Meese may have been part of a bribe conspiracy
in connection with a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project. The
Washington Post reported that Rappaport changed his mind because he
was afraid he might not remember everything accurately.
   Federal prosecutors decided to have criminal charges filed
against Wallach, Chinn and London and decided not to grant them
immunity from prosecution to compel their testimony.
   In December, after the three invoked their Fifth Amendment right
against self incrimination, McKay said he might seek their
testimony again after their criminal trial on racketeering charges
in the Wedtech scandal.
   On Friday, McKay said there was insufficient evidence to date to
warrant indicting Meese in connection with a $1 billion Iraqi
pipeline plan in which Wallach was involved, or a possible conflict
of interest involving Meese's telephone company stock, a matter in
which Chinn was involved.
   Meese said he was ``gratified by the action and the statement.''
   At a news conference, Meese referred to the independent
counsel's investigation as ``an exhaustive process. ... When that
particular process is completed I think there will be no doubt in
anybody's mind what the facts are and at that time I will rest on
that judgment.''
   When a reporter pointed out that principals in the investigation
weren't talking, Meese responded, ``I'm not going to comment on any
aspect or details of the inquiry. That's something that will have
to be determined by the independent counsel.''
   Sources familiar with McKay's probe have said that although the
special prosecutor has not found sufficient evidence to indict
Meese, he could issue a sharply critical report about Meese's
conduct.
   The grand jury will continue to examine the pipeline and
telephone stock matters mostly to tie up ``loose ends,'' the source
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   If McKay dismisses the grand jury without bringing charges, he
could retain his appointment or seek reappointment if new evidence
surfaces later, the source said.
   The grand jury is expected to question Meese, his wife, Ursula,
and U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who was head of the
Justice Department's antitrust division during the breakup of the
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   In regard to the pipeline, Wallach, who was Rappaport's lawyer,
obtained Meese's help in arranging a meeting with then-National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to help boost the pipeline
project.
   Four months later, Wallach wrote Meese a memo that Wallach said
was based on conversations with Rappaport. It said a portion of up
to $700 million from the oil pipeline would be funneled to the
Labor Party of then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
   That raised questions of whether Meese, who has said he doesn't
recall reading that portion of the memo, may have violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes to foreign officials.
   Without being able to question Wallach or Rappaport, McKay is at
a dead end.
   Another part of McKay's probe the independent counsel says he
has insufficient evidence on which to seek indictment is Meese's
ownership of $14,000 in stock in the regional Bell telephone
companies.
   Chinn was involved in the Baby Bell stck ownership at a critical
juncture.
   Meese as attorney general met with executives of four of the
regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he owned the stock.
   At the time, the Bell companies were seeking to reverse the
Justice Department's position opposing the Bells' expansion into
new areas of business. Meese ended up approving a reversal of the
department's position early in 1987.
   Meese says he had intended to sell the stock in 1985 but
couldn't because he had lost the stock certificates.
   Complicating McKay's investigation was the fact that Meese had
signed a transfer of property agreement with Chinn assigning the
Baby Bell stock to the financial manager for more than two years.
Meese initially listed the stock as having been sold on his
financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 1986.
   Meese got replacement certificates late last summer and finally
sold the stock himself after getting Chinn to return it to him.
   Meese says he considered the transfer agreement a legitimate
divestiture of the stock. But McKay's investigators are unable to
delve into details of the arrangement because they were unable to
question Chinn.
   In December, McKay said he had insufficient evidence at that
time to seek an indictment of Meese in the Wedtech scandal and said
he might seek testimony from Wallach and Chinn again after their
trial.
   In the Wedtech probe, then-White House counselor Meese
interceded on the company's behalf at Wallach's behest to assist
the firm in its efforts to obtain a $32 million no-bid contract to
build small engines for the Army.
   The company got the contract following a crucial White House
meeting called by Meese's deputy. Three years later, Meese set up a
financial partnership after Wallach introduced Meese to Chinn _ who
at the time was doing work for Wedtech and who later sat on the
company's board of directors.

<HEAD>Byrd Wants Heat On Reagan to Sign Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd asked
Americans on Saturday to pressure President Reagan into signing
comprehensive trade legislation.
   ``Write the president and tell him ... that this trade bill will
help you and help America feel proud again,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., urged
in the Democratic Party's weekly radio address.
   Under a compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators
Thursday night, the U.S. trade representative would have the
authority to impose import curbs on the goods of nations who
violate trade agreements. The president could waive the curbs if he
thought their cost would outweigh the benefit.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Friday renewed the
threat of a veto by President Reagan, saying the bill unreasonably
ties the president's hands and that the administration has ``grave
reservations'' about it.
   Byrd complained that ``the president has done nothing but cry
protectionism and wave his veto pen'' as the ability of the United
States to compete has eroded.
   ``This is not the time for a veto,'' he said. ``The trade bill
is a strong comprehensive bill that helps American workers help
themselves.''
   He said the Democrats' ``goal has been a bill that the president
will sign,'' adding, ``We have extended our hand in cooperation.''
   ``The president may not understand what this bill means to the
American worker ... I think you do,'' Byrd said in urging his
listeners to write to the White House.
   The measure also would impose import restrictions to punish
Toshiba Corp. of Japan for a subsidiary's role in selling
computerized submarine propeller milling equipment to the Soviet
Union.
   And, it would require employers to give workers a 60-day notice
of plant closings and large layoffs.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
weekly radio address, delivered Saturday by Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia:
   Good afternoon. This is Sen. Robert C. Byrd from West Virginia.
The Congress is putting the finishing touches on a very important
trade bill.
   It is not a minute too soon. Our nation's trade policy is in
shambles. You know it. I know it. We import more than we export. We
send more of our money overseas than we get back. We are losing
American jobs. We are losing our industrial base. We are in hock to
foreign lenders.
   Once it wasn't so. America traded hard all over the world. The
result was money in the bank and jobs for American workers. America
ran a trade surplus. ``Made in the USA'' was on the product that
everybody looked for. Americans took pride in being No. 1.
   Now our ability to compete is eroding. For seven years the
president has refused to act. ``Free trade,'' he says. What about
fair trade? The president has done nothing but cry protectionism
and wave his veto pen. Yet, unless we change the way America trades
the tide of change will sweep our economic destiny out of our hands.
   You know what I am talking about. You see it in the frustration
of all the young families who cannot afford to buy their first
home. You understand it when American companies take their jobs
overseas.
   America is rapidly developing a treadmill economy; everyone is
working harder just to keep up; yet we still seem to be losing
ground to our foreign competition. Our prosperity has always been
built on working smarter as well as harder. Yet, despite our new
technology and effort to compete, we have been losing the
productivity race.
   For years the Reagan administration has left trade policy to the
whims of the international marketplace and our foreign competition.
The administration has refused to act. It has had a do-nothing
trade policy.
   It is time to get America moving again. The stakes are high and
measured in jobs, and in the life style we pass on to our children,
and in our vital national security.
   Congress will soon send the president a comprehensive trade
bill. We are not ready to say good-bye to the America of our
dreams. What must be done to rebuild America's dreams?
   First, America must boost its exports. Selling more goods
overseas lowers the deficit. It is that simple. Our bill gives the
president new tools to open new markets for American products.
   Second, we must take steps to promote America's long run
competitive strengths. We want to see more investment in
individuals and in ideas. That means a better educated work force,
stronger laws to protect American inventions from piracy by foreign
firms.
   Third, we want to give American industry and workers the
opportunity to retool and retrain quickly. I have seen the
devastating impact in my own state of West Virginia where closed
factories leave workers and whole communities struggling for their
economic future.
   This trade bill sharply improves the opportunities for workers
to retrain, to start new careers. If American workers want to move
to expanding parts of the job market they ought to have that chance.
   Finally, this trade bill would prevent foreign investors from
dominating industries vital to our national security. America
cannot control its destiny if our foreign competition is buying up
our assets.
   Opening new markets for exports, giving American industry a leg
up to retool, creating new opportunities for American workers to
retrain, keeping America's destiny in American hands, educating our
children for a prosperous future _ these are the essentials of this
trade bill, which the president would veto.
   In the last few months you have heard a lot of talk about this
trade bill from the president. I am sure you will hear more. Our
goal has been a bill that the president will sign. We have extended
our hand in cooperation.
   This is not a time for a veto. The trade bill is a strong
comprehensive bill that helps American industry and helps American
workers help themselves.
   The president may not understand what this bill means to the
American worker, to young families who cannot buy their first home,
to the unemployed worker who has lost his job to a foreign
competitor. I think you do.
   So write the president. Tell him of your concerns. Let him know
that this trade bill will help America feel proud again. Let's put
America's future back in American hands.

   An Iraqi pilot held captive by Iran said
Saturday he was shocked to learn how many civilians were killed in
an Iraqi gas attack on a border town and assumed the raid was a
mistake.
   Air Force Maj. Ahmed Sakr Salaleh, 31, said he was shown an
Iranian documentary of the aftermath of the raid two weeks ago on
the Kurdish town of Halabja, in northeastern Iraq.
   ``All of us suffer seeing these pictures,'' Salaleh told
reporters in Tehran. ``I ask God to take all of them to paradise.''
   Salaleh said he was aware that the Iraqi air force had been
dropping chemical weapons but added: ``We are under orders. We are
officers.''
   He said the chemical bombs were dropped to halt Iranian advances
into Iraqi territory. Iran and Iraq have been at war since
September 1980.
   Iraq has denied using chemical weapons, which are banned by
international law.
   Iran has said it captured large tracts of territory in northeast
Iraq in league with Kurdish separatists. Iraq said Saturday it
routed the attackers.
   Iran says chemical weapons raids on Halabja, 160 miles northeast
of Baghdad, killed 5,000 people and wounded another 5,000 on March
16-17.
   The Iraqi pilot said his Soviet-built Sukhoi Su-22 was shot down
30 miles south of Halabja on March 18 after the gas attacks were
over.
   He said he earlier had released four conventional-explosive
1,100-pound bombs over uninhabited territory when clouds prevented
bombing of a road.
   Salaleh said he ejected and parachuted into Iranian-held
territory. Iran has claimed shooting down more than a dozen Iraqi
warplanes since mid-March.
   The Iraqi officer said he was not involved in the Halabja
attack. He said he was assigned to drop a chemical bomb into
wetland border territory of Iraq in 1983 to prevent an Iranian
offensive there.
   The bomb he dropped then was put on his plane by a crew in
civilian clothes who arrived at the air force base with a truck and
trailer with civilian plates, Salaleh said.
   He estimated about 50 planes raided Halabja from March 16-18
after the Iranians and Kurdish guerrillas captured the town.
Salaleh, speaking in relatively good English, said he thought the
chemical-bomb attack was a ``mistake.''
   He said one possible explanation was that Iraqi intelligence did
not know the inhabitants were still in the town.
   Salaleh said he had been well treated since he was captured but
had not yet been transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp.
   He said he had heard on Iraqi television that Iran has used
artillery gas shells but had no confirmation of this, adding that
Iraqi forces had been issued gas masks.
   Iran has denied using the internationally banned chemical
weapons, but has said it has the capability to produce them.
   Iraq has repeatedly denied using the weapons, while coupling its
denials with assurances it will use ``all means'' at its disposal
to defend its territory.

<HEAD>Sale of Department Store Giant Will Bring Changes to Retail
Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sale of Federated Department Stores Inc. to
Campeau Corp. is more than just a retailer changing hands. Analysts
fear the $6.58 billion deal may lead to more centralization and
less innovation in the retail industry .
   When ownership of the nation's fifth-largest retailer passes to
Campeau, the Toronto-based developer will do what it did when it
acquired Allied Stores Corp. at the end of 1986: pare the company
down, sell its less attractive divisions and keep its most
profitable stores.
   The forecasts are that Federated, now a collection of diverse
department and specialty stores, will become a centralized retailer
with few differences among its various units.
   ``The structure will be much more of a chain store company,''
said Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst with the investment
firm Morgan Stanley & Co.
   Robert H. Morosky, the president of Allied Stores, denied
Saturday that Campeau would centralize buying operations of
Federated department store divisions that include Bloomingdale's
and Abraham & Straus in New York, Lazarus in the Midwest and
Burdine's in Florida.
   Operations such as distribution will be centralized, he said,
but the stores' merchandise mix ``will be determined by the local
department store divisions.''
   However, Loeb predicted that under Campeau, Federated would
consolidate operations such as purchasing and marketing that are
now carried out separately by the Federated units.
   ``The merchandise will be uniform,'' said Loeb, who has been
tracking the industry for almost 40 years. ``It's bad for the whole
industry.''
   Retail industry watchers want to see what Loeb called
``innovativeness and testing,'' which helps develop new styles and
trends. When there are more retailers buying and experimenting,
there is a greater opportunity for growth in the retail industry.
   Friday's announcement of an agreement between Federated and
Campeau ended a grueling takeover battle that began Jan. 25.
Federated resisted Campeau's overtures for a month, agreed to
negotiate with the Canadian company, and then in early March
accepted a buyout offer from R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.
   The wrangling continued for yet another month, until Macy agreed
on Friday to bow out. But the New York-based retailer came away
from the fight with the Federated divisions it wanted most,
Bullock's stores in California and the Southwest and the San
Francisco-based I. Magnin chain.
   Many retail industry analysts were rooting for Macy to win the
battle outright. They believed Macy would have re-energized
Federated's department store divisions in much the way Macy has
revitalized its own image in recent years.
   Campeau, they believed, was interested more in Federated's real
estate than its retail operations. The stores would give Campeau
Chairman Robert Campeau an instant entree into major shopping malls
in the United States.
   The expected sale of several of Federated's divisions represents
a chance for the retailing industry to move in a new direction, but
whether that happens depends on who buys the stores.
   Morosky said Campeau will retain Bloomingdale's, Abraham &
Straus, Lazarus and Burdine's, as well as Tennessee-based
Goldsmith's and Atlanta-based Rich's department stores.
   Campeau has already agreed to sell Federated's Texas-based
Foley's and Boston-based Filene's department stores to May
Department Stores Co.
   Federated's discount and specialty store chains and its
supermarkets divisions are expected to go on the block. However,
Morosky said, ``After we comple te our review, we might choose to
keep certain divisions.''
   Campeau wants to sell some of the divisions to pay off debt
incurred in the Federated purchase and to simplify operations,
Morosky said.
   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm
Seidler Amdec Securities Inc., said recently that if Campeau sells
Federated's units to larger companies _ such as May _ it would
continue the trend toward central control and ``sameness.''
   However, he said, if the stores are sold to smaller companies or
to entrepreneurial management groups, it would mean increased
competition, which in turn leads to growth in the retail industry.
   ``The long-term benefit is to the consumer,'' Tashjian said.
   Morosky said Campeau already has received inquiries from
retailers, existing management and real estate developers about
some of the Federated stores. He said the stores would go on sale
several days after the purchase of Federated is completed.

   Israeli troops shot and killed six Arab
protesters Saturday on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz's visit to the Middle East. It was the highest one-day death
toll in four months of unrest in the occupied territories.
   The violence, coming at the beginning of the Jewish Passover
holiday, was expected to take its toll on Christian Easter
celebrations as well.
   Church officials have said they expect a severe drop in pilgrims
attending the traditional Easter Sunday Mass in Jerusalem because
of the unrest.
   Thousands of Christians usually attend the Mass at the
12th-century Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition says
Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected.
   In Bethlehem, army helicopters buzzed a funeral procession for a
slain Palestinian and flew over the site where Chrisitans believe
Jesus was born.
   Since Dec. 8, 133 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier have been
killed in the violence in the territories occupied by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
   The most violent clash Saturday took place in the seaside Gaza
Strip, where the army said a gang of Palestinian protesters hurled
knives and metal rods at troops patroling a main street of Gaza
City.
   An army spokesman said the protesters tried to seize the
soldier's weapons, and troops opened fire to extricate themselves,
killing three Arabs and wounding two.
   One Israeli soldier suffered medium stab wounds and was taken to
nearby Tel Hashomer hospital, the spokesman said. He said another
soldier was slightly injured.
   Troops in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem shot and
killed a 23-year-old Arab during a battle with hundreds of
protesters in the winding, cobblestoned streets of the town's main
market.
   Troops also killed a protester in Beit Liqya, in the West Bank
10 miles north of Jerusalem, and killed another in nearby Deir al
Sudan when their patrols came under attack, the army spokesman said.
   Palestinian reporters identified the dead as Jihad Assi, 19 from
Beit Liqya and Hamis Mahmud Ahmed, 41, from Deir al Sudan.
   The army's version of the clash in Gaza conflicted with reports
from U.N. officials, who said the violence began when Israelis in
civilian clothing got out of two cars and tried to arrest a
Palestinian youth.
   Christine Dabagh, a U.N. spokeswoman in Gaza, quoted local
residents as saying the boy's father attacked the Israelis with an
axe, and troops who arrived at the scene killed the father. In the
ensuing clash, the boy's uncle was shot and wounded, she said, and
two others were killed.
   Palestinian reporters identified the dead men as Jamil Rashad al
Kourdy, 55, Ahmed Samir al Kourdy, 40, and Hassan al Kourdy, 21,
all members of the same family.
   There were conflicting reports on the number of wounded
protesters. The army reported two wounded by gunfire, but
Palestinian journalists set the number as high as 13.
   In Bethlehem, a crowd of Easter holiday tourists outside the
historic Church of the Nativity watched as a funeral march for
Salim Hallas El Shaer, the 23-year-old shot earlier Saturday in
Bethlehem, become a defiant anti-Israeli demonstration.
   After burying El Shaer on the outskirts of Bethlehem, about 700
mourners marched back to central Manger Square chanting: ``PLO!
Israel, no!'' and ``Allah Akhbar'' (Arabic for ``God is great'').
   As army helicopters buzzed over the square, the site where
tradition says Jesus was born, an Associated Press reporter saw
angry mourners smash the windows of the municipality building.
   El Shaer, an electrician, was killed after Israeli troops tried
to keep a market from opening. Groups of youths attacked the
soldiers with rocks and the soldiers responded with bullets,
witnesses said.
   The army spokesman said troops only fired when el Shaer
approached them with an object resembling a firebomb.
   On the 10-foot-wide street where El Shaer was shot, the branch
of an olive tree had been placed in a puddle of blood. It was
accompanied by a sign which read: ``The heroic martyr, Salim.''
   The violence came on the eve of Shultz's arrival on a Middle
East swing strongly opposed by Palestinian underground leaders, who
have accused the secretary of trying to crush their uprising.
   In the latest underground leaflet, released Thursday, leaders
called for a three-day general strike Monday through Wednesday to
protest the Shultz trip. They also ordered riots ``to block
Shultz's peace plan and stop him from killing the uprising.''

<TEXT>
   America's biotechnology industry, hailed
Saturday by President Reagan for its ``promise to revolutionize
medicine, agriculture and protection of the environment,'' is
seriously hampered by government delays on patent applications,
congressional and industry officials say.
   Reagan, in a radio address from his California ranch, called for
renewed U.S. determination to remain the world's scientific leader,
noting that ``over the years, we've secured far more patents than
any other country.'' He cited biotechnology as one of the most
fertile fields for exploration.
   For hundreds of small biotech companies developing new drugs,
plants and other products through molecular biology, the issuance
of a patent can mean instant success. But the wait can take more
than four years, leaving some firms to ponder the risk of marketing
their products without patent protection.
   In some of the biotech examining units at the U.S. Office of
Patents and Trademarks, ``it takes an average of 27 months just to
open an application file, and another 25 months to award or deny a
patent,'' complained Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore, whose House Small
Business subcommittee is looking into the problem.
   Biotech products have begun to pour out of the laboratories of
the 12-year-old industry, doubling the backlog of patent
applications from 3,903 in 1985 to 7,821 by August of last year. By
some estimates, 11,000 applications are now pending.
   According to industry forecasts, biotech sales in U.S. markets
will total $650 million this year. Barring further bureaucratic
snags, the industry projects domestic sales of $3.4 billion by 1993
and $13.2 billion by 1998. International sales could triple the
domestic figure, officials say.
   But ``the longer it takes of patents to be issued, the longer we
work in a black hole,'' says Hubert J.P. Schoemaker, chairman of
Centocor, Inc.
   That complaint is echoed by officials of Genentech, which has
begun marketing a much-acclaimed drug known as TPA _ a clot buster
for heart attack victims. Genentech's patent application is still
pending, however, and several other companies are planning to
market their own TPA drugs.
   Turnover among biotech patent examiners, lured to private
companies by higher pay, has been part of the problem. Wyden said
the turnover was 50 percent last year, though the patent office has
created 10 new biotech positions for a total of 42, and recently
consolidated all those positions within a special biotech unit.
   Patent Commissioner Donald J. Quigg said, meanwhile, that the
office is seeking approval from the Office of Personnel Management
to create special pay rates for the examiners, who usually have a
doctorate or master's degree in molecular biology or biochemistry.
   Quigg said the goal of the patent office is to process all
applications within 18 months, but that target likely won't be met
until 1993 or 1994.
   To encourage inventions, the Constitution gives inventors the
right to a short-term exclusive monopoly on products that result
from their new ideas. Currently, the monopoly lasts 17 years.
   To make sure the invention is indeed new, and not an obvious
twist to existing technology, the patent office examines
applications in light of previous patents.
   Lack of patents leads firms to hold their products off the
market, or to risk theft of their invention if they sell without
full protection. Since the United States does not publish
applications after 18 months, as all other major countries do, the
backlog may lead several companies to undertake duplicate research
they would not perform if they knew someone else was likely to win
a patent.
   ``Increasing backlogs in the processing of patent applications
will have serious deleterious effects on continuing investment and
the maintenance of the United States' leadership position,'' said
George B. Rathmann, president of Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks,
Calif., in testimony to Wyden's subcommittee.
   Linda I. Miller, a vice president of PaineWebber Inc., a Wall
Street investment firm, found in a survey of four dozen
prospectuses by biotechnology companies that nearly all mentioned
uncertainty about patent protection as a potential risk for
investors.
   She gave the subcommittee charts of price movements of several
stocks, up when specific patents were awarded and down when patent
disputes broke out between two companies.
   The applications backlog appears to be growing at 20 percent a
year, she reported.
   ``With the lack of clarity of property rights in biotechnology
in the United States, many companies are developing similar
products _ expending valuable resources, both human and financial _
on me-too programs,'' she said.

   The man who allegedly stabbed two
co-workers to death at an archaeological firm and severely wounded
two others was a former prison inmate who was apparently hired out
of sympathy, police and friends of the victims said.
   All four victims were ``stabbed with a knife or other sharp
instrument,'' police Capt. John Sheehan said. He would not say if a
weapon had been recovered.
   The Philadelphia Daily News reported Saturday that the stabbings
occurred after the attacker tried to rape one of the women who was
killed, but Lower Merion Township detectives refused to confirm
that.
   Friday's attack occurred in a house where the archaeological
firm, SJS Industries, examined artifacts. Its excavation was
federally mandated as part of a sewer line installation in this
Philadelphia suburb, said Bill Stanyard, 32, who has worked with
SJS.
   Lower Merion Township Police Lt. John Maloney identified the
dead women as Clarice J. Dorner, 30, of Elk Grove Village, Ill.,
and Annaliese H. Killoran, 22, of Lynn, Mass. They were graduate
students in anthropology and archaeology.
   Glenn W. Sheehan, 39, of Conshohocken, and his pregnant wife,
Anne M. Jensen, 31, were taken to hospitals. They were working on
their doctorates in anthropology at Bryn Mawr College in nearby
Bryn Mawr, said college spokeswoman Catherine LaFarge.
   Police flooded the wooded area, but failed to find the attacker.
Police also closed the Schuylkill Expressway, the state's most
congested, for an hour, leading to an accident involving a truck on
a side road.
   Police were looking for Arthur Faulkner, a Philadelphia man
described as 40 to 45. WCAU-TV, quoting police sources, reported
that Faulkner was released from prison last October after serving
time for attempted rape.
   Sheehan's friends said he often hired former convicts whom he
felt needed a second chance.
   John Jensen, Anne Jensen's brother, said he had worked with
Faulkner and others at the site. He described Faulkner as a former
inmate who seemed interested in his job as a digger.
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``I talked to him
yesterday. He was a solid worker, he never complained.''
   ``Glenn (Sheehan) is on the Philadelphia prison board and he got
him (Faulkner) from there or the Salvation Army,'' Jensen said.
``He had been assured that he had no violent past.''
   Sheehan is a member of the board of the Philadelphia Prison
Society, a prison advocacy group. Telephone calls placed Saturday
to the society and the Salvation Army went unanswered.
   Sheehan was taken to Bryn Mawr Hospital with stab wounds of the
legs, arms and abdomen. Hospital spokeswoman Elaine McVay said he
was in stable condition Saturday.
   His wife was in serious but stable condition Saturday at
Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, spokeswoman Phyllis Fisher
said. She suffered multiple stab wounds to the back and had
internal injuries, but her fetus apparently suffered no trauma, a
spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Prof To Meet His Dream Girl: The Voice of the Teller Machine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he wrote a newspaper column about
falling in love with the voice at the automatic teller machine,
Dick Ferry never imagined he would meet the Scottish woman who
recorded the message.
   But a local newspaper found the woman and arranged for her to
come to central Illinois after editors decided Ferry ``should get
to meet his infatuation.''
   Sally Masterson, a 29-year-old Scot who hosts a radio talk show
in London, is scheduled to arrive here Wednesday.
   ``Truthfully it is frightening ... that she will be so
disappointed in me,'' said Ferry, an education professor, columnist
and happily-married 60-year-old man.
   ``I think I'm in love with a woman I've never seen,'' Ferry
wrote in his Feb. 4 ``Prairie Talk'' column in The Decatur Herald &
Review. ``My infatuation is with the talking teller at the Money
Network station at First National Bank downtown.
   ``I imagine I must have a lot of competition, too, from any
other guy who is a pushover for her seductive, sophisticated
high-English way of saying, `Please wait while your transaction is
processing.'''
   The unmarried Ms. Masterson told the newspaper she was flattered
by Ferry's interest. ``I'd be delighted to give him his money
personally,'' she said.
   Her voice, recorded three years ago in Dundee, Scotland for NCR
Corp., was chosen because of its ``very soft-spoken Scottish
accent, nice and clear,'' said Euan Williamson, an NCR consultant
engineer.
   The story has made a big splash in the British press, which is
calling it a ``romantic rendezvous'' triggered by a Scottish accent
which is ``driving an American teacher wild,'' the Decatur
newspaper reported.
   The Decatur paper published the woman's photograph and Ferry, a
professor at Millikin University, said he wasn't disappointed.
   ``She's an absolutely beautiful girl. And I think I really
should have my wife along when I meet her,'' he said.
   Ferry's wife, Carol, says she has been teased her about the
competition.
   ``I didn't realize I was going to be face-to-face with her,''
Mrs. Ferry said. ``It's a little unreal. But how would anyone feel
if a young sexy person wants to meet your husband. I don't know
what to say.''

   Eight months after they landed to
enforce a peace accord between rival ethnic groups, Indian soldiers
are chasing a faceless enemy.
   The Tamil rebels, who have waged a four-year war of guerrilla
fighting and terrorism against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority, seem
to be everywhere and nowhere at once.
   Every young man is a potential foe, whether dressed in trousers
or the plaid sarongs favored in the steamy heat of this tropical
island 18 miles off India's southern coast.
   Every few miles along potholed roads, Indian soldiers man
sandbagged checkpoints where they halt travelers who come on foot,
on bicycles and jammed into minibuses.
   Despite an Indian force estimated at 50,000 by the Indians and
as high as 100,000 by Sri Lankan officials, a ragtag band of Tamil
Tiger rebels continues to kill and maim Indian soldiers, massacre
Sinhalese villagers and extort money from Tamils, Sinhalese and
Moslems alike.
   The Indians say there are about 2,500 hard-core fighters in the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest rebel group. The
Tigers claim there are only 175.
   More than 8,000 Sri Lankans, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed
since 1984. India has lost at least 400 soldiers since Oct. 10,
1987, when it launched an offensive to disarm the Tigers.
   The Indians sent troops to control the rebels as part of a peace
plan they sponsored in July 1987. The agreement granted some
autonomy to Tamils, but it was rejected by extremists on both sides
of the conflict.
   India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbor, has a large Tamil minority
of its own.
   Despite India's firepower, armor, lumbering troop trucks,
darting Jeep patrols and helicopters _ and allied government forces
_ the Tigers slip from village to village and even into big towns
like Batticaloa.
   In Arapattai, 5 miles south of Batticaloa on Sri Lanka's eastern
coast, Indian soldiers recently checked pedestrians' identity cards
and munched snacks purchased in local shops.
   A five-minute walk away, a man sought by the Indians for
harboring Tiger fighters said the rebels could not be vanquished.
``Our fight is reasonable. We must win,'' he said, switching on an
electric fan as an elderly relative tended his infant twins.
   The man asked not to be identified, although the Indians know
his name and where he lives. They also know that the minute they
come after him, his neighbors will sound an alarm and he will slip
away _ as he has done several times before _ through the fences of
woven palm fronds that make Arapattai look like an impenetrable
maze.
   The Tigers are fighting for an autonomous region in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka. Although Tamils make up only 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, they are a majority in Northern and
Eastern provinces.
   In Eastern Province's Batticaloa District, the population of
about 365,000 is 72 percent Tamil. Sinhalese account for only 3
percent there, while Moslems comprise 25 percent.
   The Tamils say they have been discriminated against in
education, jobs and by a 1956 law that made Sinhalese the official
language of Sri Lanka. Tamils are mainly Hindu, and the Sinhalese
are Buddhists.
   Batticaloa, population 46,000, is a town of poor fishermen,
small shops and many churches, monuments to the missionary efforts
of the Dutch, Portuguese and British colonial eras.
   The Indian presence keeps armed Tigers out of clear sight. But,
according to residents who feared for their safety if their names
were published, the Tigers make themselves felt in other ways.
   ``They send notes asking for money. People who refuse are
killed,'' a middle-aged Tamil said. ``They have people in the
banks, so they know how much money we have.''
   But that Tamil, like others who described the Tigers'
fund-raising tactics, defended the rebels' cause as a just fight
for Tamil rights.
   ``Just because they're militant, they're not unreasonable,''
said one Tamil bureaucrat.
   A occasional land mine or hand grenade explodes in Batticaloa
near a group of the Indian soldiers or the predominantly Sinhalese
Sri Lankan police force.
   Sometimes, the Indian response is disciplined. Other times, it
verges on panic, Batticaloa residents said.
   On March 26, a grenade was thrown at the Sri Lankan police
headquarters. No one was hurt by the grenade, but it prompted three
hours of gunfire that injured a half-dozen people, including two
schoolchildren.
   Sri Lankan police officers declined to say whether their men
fired, but Batticaloa residents said the police apparently started
the shooting and the Indians followed with automatic rifle fire.
   ``The roads were packed with children,'' said the Rev. Harry
Miller, a Jesuit from New Orleans who has spent the past 40 years
at St. Michael's school. ``The schoolchildren just panicked. They
dropped their books and bicycles and ran.''
   An Indian major, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted
that mistakes have been made. ``There is no doubt there is some
confusion,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Armenian Leader May Have Instigated Disturbances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disturbances in Soviet Armenia may have
been instigated by a local leader who was a target of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's anti-corruption campaign, according to analysts.
   The local leader may have capitalized on unrest exacerbated by
Gorbachev's drive for economic reform, known as ``perestroika,''
and his allowance of greater public debate of some topics, known as
``glasnost,'' according to a government analyst.
   Similar disturbances have been reported in each of the 15
republics in the Soviet Union. And in many instances, the
demonstrations grew out of Russian resentment of Kremlin efforts to
help non-Russians by giving them jobs and raising their living
standards, scholar Paul Goble of Washington said in an article last
year.
   ``Many Russians came to the conclusion that what had appeared to
be reasonable affirmative action for the non-Russians was in fact
unreasonable reverse discrimination against themselves,'' Goble
wrote.
   That system worked under the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev,
who tolerated corruption and widespread inefficiency in the
economy. Under his leadership, a Russian and a non-Russian were
frequently allowed to hold redundant jobs.
   But Gorbachev, in his effort to streamline the economy, has
stepped on a lot of ethnic toes.
   ``It is not that he is coming down hard on any ethnic group. It
is that he is trying to make the economy more efficient,'' said
Nancy Lubin, a Georgetown University professor.
   Ostensibly, the demonstrations in Armenia, a largely Christian
republic, stemmed from Armenian desire to administer the largely
Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is in neighboring
Azerbaijan, a predominately Moslem republic.
   But the unrest began after party newspapers criticized the
Armenian party leader, Karen Demirchyan, said an administration
source, who like other government analysts interviewed, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Demirchyan, 55, named to his post in 1974, was attacked last
June by Gorbachev, who said that reforms were ``stuck in a rut'' in
Armenia, and that Demirchyan and his underlings showed ``totally
unjustified complacency'' toward corruption.
   Reformers in the Armenia Communist Party attempted to oust
Demirchyan during a meeting of the party Central Committee last
December, but were thwarted, according to Elizabeth Fuller, a
Soviet-watcher based in Munich.
   The authoritative Communist Party daily Pravda hinted strongly
of a purge in Armenia.
   ``The absolute majority of Armenian working people are honest
persons who conscientiously attend their duty, and it is not their
fault that the process of democratization and renewal is meeting
with fierce resistance of perestroika,'' Pravda said in December.
``People yearn for genuine changes.''
   The demonstrations in Armenia began two months later ``with
either the complicity or encouragement of Demirchyan,'' said a
government analyst. ``We believe he backed them, or encouraged
them, to warn Moscow that getting rid of him could cause trouble.''
   Demirchyan has survived the upheaval, although some party
leaders in Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh have been removed.
   Gorbachev's efficiency drive has cost local jobs in Kazakhstan,
the scene of riots in December 1986. Gorbachev abolished the
Kazakhstan Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metallurgy, transferring its
functions to a parallel ministry in Moscow, but ``throwing a lot of
educated Kazakhs out of work,'' said a government analyst.
   Similarly, Gorbachev's highly celebrated campaign against
alcohol has cost jobs in the vineyards of Armenia, creating tension
there, said the analyst.
   The ethnic unrest has prompted Gorbachev to announce that he
will convene the policy-making Communist Party Central Committee to
discuss the issue at an as yet unannounced date.
   Gorbachev probably will continue to crack down, as he did in
Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan, ``to show people that they
can't get what they want by going to the streets,'' an analyst said.

   A bus slammed into the back of a water
tanker truck on a country road Saturday, killing five French
tourists and injuring 29, police said.
   The accident occurred at about 10:00 a.m. when the Greek tour
bus, carrying 47 French tourists to the ancient ruins and theater
of Epidauros, hit the back end of the truck, flipped over and
crashed into an orange grove, police said.
   ``The bus was directly behind the truck. The truck took a left
turn and the bus hit it from behind, flipped over two or three
times and crashed into the orange trees,'' said a police official
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said two men, a woman and a young girl were killed
instantly. A woman died after being taken to the Athens KAT
hospital. Seven of the seriously injured were also transported to
the hospital, he said. The other 22 injured were being treated at
Corinth General Hospital.
   The spokesman said the accident occurred near the seaside
village of Loutra Oraias Elenis, 27 miles south of Corinth.
   He said the French tourists had left Athens early Saturday for
the 114-mile trip to Epidauros.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
   Officials identified the dead as Claude Patte, 44, Michel
Patrick, 40, Anne Eugenie Jouan, 9, and Marie Gabion, no age
available. Another woman killed in the collision was identified
only by the surname Dorre.
   Police said all the tourists were from Paris.

   An Estonian nationalist, his family and
the wife of another nationalist were kicked out of the Soviet Union
on Saturday, according to a spokesman for a Stockholm-based
Estonian nationalist organization.
   Mart Kikerpuu, spokesman for Hjalpcentralen, an organization
which specializes in helping political refugees from the Soviet
republic, said one of the expelled, Jaan Nomm, held a nationalistic
speech in Tallinn last Feb. 24, on the 70th anniversary of
Estonia's pre-Soviet independence.
   The organization said this was why he was forced to leave.
   Nomm was accompanied by his wife and two children, Kikerpuu said.
   His oldest son, Eke-Part Nomm, a Buddhist activist, was expelled
to Sweden on Feb. 13 along with another Buddhist, Vello Vaartnou.
   The fifth Estonian who arrived in Sweden Saturday was the wife
of Vaartnou, Kikerpuu said.

<HEAD>Diesel Oil Spill Stretches More Than 50 Miles On Ohio River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS S. WATSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diesel oil spill floated along about 50
miles of the Ohio River on Saturday, and the Coast Guard and state
officials were searching for the source of the fuel.
   ``We want to make sure it's not still flowing into the river,''
said Lt. Eric Mosher. ``We're looking for the source and have teams
from Louisville and Cincinnati making bank searches.''
   The oil extended from the area of Madison in southeastern
Indiana to Louisville.
   Indiana conservation authorities also helped in the search,
Mosher added. Barge fleets, towboats and holding tanks along the
river were all being checked.
   Mosher said the water was too choppy for an attempt to contain
the oil slick.
   The spill apparently caused no serious problem for communities
that use the river as a source of drinking water and Mosher said
none of them had closed water intake valves.
   ``We're treating (the river water) for some of the byproducts of
oil, but the river is relatively warm and it doesn't look like it's
emulsifying and it looks like it will float past,'' said Jerry
Ford, manager of administrative services for the Louisville Water
Co.
   ``Shutting down (intake valves) is always an alternative to
treating, but when you have oil byproducts that will float on top
of the water, normally you don't have that much effect,'' Ford
said. He noted that the intake valves are on the river bottom.
   Indiana State Police Sgt. James Hickerson said the slick was not
thick and heavy all the way, but there were traces for the entire
distance.
   Patrolman Tim Armstrong, in Madison, Ind., said his department
began getting reports of a strong diesel smell from the river about
7:30 p.m. Friday, and the spill was discovered after sunup Saturday
morning.
   Officials were unable to say what effect the spill might have on
the environment.
   ``It depends on (the oil's) consistency as to whether or not it
will threaten wildlife,'' Ford said.
   ``We've had no fish kill and haven't observed loss of any marine
life,'' said Sgt. Carroll Henneke of the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. ``We don't anticipate any simply because this
appears to be floating. If it doesn't settle in, we don't expect to
lose any of our fishery.''

   Riot police fought hundreds of
firebomb-throwing radical students Saturday after the police used
tear gas to keep the students from marching off a campus.
   Riot police fired multiple tear gas launchers at about 500
students from a dozen Seoul universities when they tried to march
out of Yonsei University after a pro-labor rally. Students
immediately streamed out of the campus and battled riot police for
several hours.
   No serious injuries or arrests were reported.
   During the rally, student leaders denounced the government of
President Roh Tae-woo as just another authoritarian regime. They
had gathered to show support for workers who want higher wages and
more independent unions.
   Labor disputes have increased sharply since Roh took office Feb.
25, as have protests by anti-government students.
   Since his election in December, Roh has promised to better the
lot of workers. But his government has also vowed to deal harshly
with violent protests to ensure the country's stability and steady
economic development.
   Violent labor protests battered many South Korean companies last
summer following widespread protests that led former President Chun
Doo-hwan to agree to democratic reforms.
   Those reforms included the direct elections in which Roh was
chosen without having won a majority when two rival opposition
candidates split the anti-government vote.

<HEAD>Police Source Says Folks Join Devilish Cult For Sex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAGNOLIA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a Satanic cult have been
frightened by the paranoia aroused by rumors that the cult was
planning a human sacrifice, authorities say.
   ``They're keeping kind of low,'' Magnolia Police Chief Smithie
Buie said of the cult members Friday.
   Terrified parents kept hundreds of students out of schools in
the nearby southern Mississippi town of McComb Thursday as a
precaution against a rumored list of potential student victims.
   But an unidentified source within the group informed police that
``they didn't want to hurt or frighten anyone,'' Buie said.
   Police in Pike County reported a quiet evening Thursday, the
night, according to rumors, that Satanists were to march down a
McComb street before sacrificing a young virgin.
   ``We didn't receive a single report Thursday night,'' Pike
County Sheriff Robert Lawson said Friday.
   Buie said the cult has existed since at least the 1960s and
although its members occasionally sacrifice animals, including cats
and dogs, they haven't been known to harm people.
   The midnight meetings are attended by between five and 20
couples, mostly between 17 and 23 years old, and are followed by
group sex, Buie said the source reported. New members traditionally
are recruited by word of mouth and are required to sacrifice an
animal, he said.
   ``I think they're mainly in it for the orgies,'' Buie said.
   Participants may be guilty of cruelty to animals and
trespassing, Buie said, but they change their ritual sites and
police never know where they will meet.
   ``Actually, as long as they are peaceful, we'd probably never
know what was happening,'' the police chief said. ``Also there's a
question of a man having a right to his own worship.''

<DATELINE>GILROY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Animal Liberation Front claimed
responsibility Saturday for a raid on a large hatchery in what it
called an ``Easter liberation for life'' for at least 28 hens.
   Members of the underground group broke into the Davis Poultry
Co. & Egg Ranch in rural Gilroy late Friday, stole 28 hens and
spraypainted the walls and grounds, said Santa Clara County Deputy
Sheriff Roland Perez.
   The underground group said it raided the farm because of alleged
``atrocious conditions'' such as overcrowding and disease,
according to Margo Tannenbaum, president of Action for Animals in
San Bernardino.
   Tannenbaum said she was asked by the Animal Liberation Front to
speak for them. The group claimed it took more than 78 laying hens,
but did not say what it did with them.
   The raid was the second by the group this Easter season. It also
took responsibility for a March 27 raid on a rabbit-breeding
company in Hayward, where 73 rabbits were taken in protest over the
slaughter of rabbits for medical research, furs and meat.
   Perez said a book on animal liberation was left behind and that
the sheriff's department would increase patrols of the area. He
said the three owners of the poultry farm were meeting with
investigators.
   The owners could not immediately be reached for comment by
telephone. A clerk at the farm said she knew nothing about the raid.
   In its statement, the Animal Liberation Front said: ``A hatchery
perpetuates the most abominable animal exploitation and abuse. We
want everyone to think about how these hens live in order to
furnish the eggs that are decorated in the celebration of `eternal
life.'''
   The group called its two raids an ``Easter liberation for life.''
   Tannenbaum, who was also used as a media conduit after the
rabbit-breeding company raid, told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview that six members of the underground group
participated in the hatchery raid.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek
said in an interview published Saturday that the Czechoslovak
government lost credibility when it broke up a peaceful
demonstration for religious freedom last week.
   The Roman Catholic cardinal was quoted in the Austrian daily
Kurier as saying that the demonstration in Bratislava March 25
``was a step towards more religious freedom and the government must
take this into account.''
   Eyewitnesses estimated about 2,000 Roman Catholics took part in
the protest on Bratislava's downtown Hviezdoslav Square. Officials
said 125 people were arrested and later released. Riot police and
water cannons broke up the demonstration, which had been banned in
advance.
   ``The Czechoslovak government, through this measure, lost even
more credibility,'' Tomasek was quoted as saying in early Sunday
editions.
   Tomasek, 88, said the Roman Catholic Church is 99 percent
laymen. ``It is the duty of the laymen to demonstrate for their
rights,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Slovak Communist Party daily Pravda charged Saturday that
the organizers of the demonstration were interested in the church
and religious freedom ``only as long as they can misuse them
politically against the socialist state.''
   According to the Czechoslovak state news agency CTK which
carried parts of the editorial, Pravda said religious activists
intended to harm talks between the Czechoslovak leadership and the
Vatican on filling 10 vacant Bishoprics.
   Tomasek complained in the Kurier interview that the Czechoslovak
delegation which is to travel to the Vatican for the next round of
negotiations later this month was ``negotiating in Rome about us,
but without us.'' The paper said Czechoslovak authorities had not
allowed him to take part.
   Austrian Cardinal Franz Koenig, in a seperate interview with
Kurier, praised the strength of religious belief in the East bloc.
   ``What the believers in these countries want _ and the Pope
supports them in this _ is not an upset of the political relations,
but the possibility as Christians to live their beliefs in a state
system which is officially based on atheism,'' Koenig was quoted as
saying.
   The former Archbishop of Vienna said he thought Pope John Paul
II's visit to Austria in June would be a ``bridge between East and
West in Europe.''
   ``What the Pope says in Austria will also be heard in
Yugoslavia, in Czechoslovakia and beyond and will be followed with
interest,'' Koenig was quoted as saying in the Kurier interview.
   Thousands of Hungarian and Slovene Catholics are expected to
come to Austria to see the Pope.

   Former Attorney General Elliot Richardson, a
casualty of the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in 1973, added his
voice on Saturday to those calling for Attorney General Edwin Meese
III to step down.
   Richardson said on Cable News Network's ``Newsmaker Saturday''
program that Meese ``has forfeited confidence'' and should resign.
   ``Too many questions'' have been raised, he said, and Meese
``was too close to too many questionable dealings,'' which are
being investigated by an independent counsel.
   Richardson resigned on Oct. 20, 1973, a Saturday, after refusing
to carry out an order from President Nixon to fire special
prosecutor Archibald Cox. At the time, Cox was investigating the
White House's involvement in the Watergate scandal.
   Richardson said that as a private citizen, Meese is entitled to
full protection of the law, just as any citizen is. But, he said
that as the nation's chief law enforcement official, Meese must be
held to a higher standard.
   ``It is absolutely vital that there be maintained the highest
possible public confidence in the integrity of the Department'' of
Justice, Richardson said.
   Independent counsel James McKay is investigating Meese's conduct
in connection with a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project and a
possible conflict of interest involving Meese's telephone company
stock.
   McKay said Friday he had insufficient evidence to date to
warrant indicting Meese in either case, but the investigation is
continuing.

   Attackers with rifles, spears and machetes
raided a village and hacked 15 men to death in what appeared to be
ongoing violence between tribes, police said Saturday.
   All the victims were Borans. The Borans have have quarreled with
another pastoral tribe, the Somalis, over land and water in arid
northern Kenya, said a police source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo was quoted in Nairobi
newspapers as saying the attack occurred Wednesday night at a
manyatta, one of the temporary settlements erected by pastoral
tribes.
   Authorities said the area is so remote that it took two days for
word of the massacre to reach the nearest town, Garbatulla, which
is 320 miles north of Nairobi, the capital.
   Kilonzo said police were sent to the area to track the killers.
He did not speculate on why the villagers were killed or who was
responsible.
   One Nairobi newspaper said the intruders were rustlers who made
off with 2,000 goats after the raid. Another newspaper called the
killers ``bandits,'' but offered no explanation for the killings.
Both newspapers quoted police.

<TEXT>
   The military rushed extra troops to
the presidential palace Saturday and launched a nationwide hunt for
the leader of an August coup attempt after he escaped from prison.
   Military leaders warned that former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, who escaped with 14 prison guards and who remains a
popular figure in the armed forces, might try to topple the
government again.
   ``If he pursues his attempts to change the government and lead
the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines), then we will have a
problem,'' military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said Saturday.
``We are asking the support of the citizens to help us. We
anticipate they (the rebels) will go on with consolidation and
propaganda and they will again try to divide the AFP.''
   Honasan, 39, escaped from a prison ship before dawn Saturday
with 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him.
He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9 for the Aug. 28
attempted coup, which left at least 53 people dead and hundreds
wounded.
   His daring escape was a blow to the prestige of the armed
forces, already facing threats from communist and Moslem rebels.
   President Corazon Aquino hurried back to Manila Saturday after
the escape, interrupting an Easter holiday in northern Luzon for
emergency meetings and a nationally televised address.
   ``I have instructed the chief of staff to issue a warning in
unmistakable terms to all military personnel that any assistance
given to the renegades will be dealt with promptly and severely
with the full force of the law,'' she said in the address.
   Mrs. Aquino, who had refused to grant amnesty to Honasan,
appealed to the public for help in tracking him down. She said he
fled to avoid court-martial for mutiny and sedition, arson, murder
and conduct unbecoming an officer. His escape, she added, ``is
tantamount to an admission of his guilt.''
   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez hinted the government would
shut down news organizations if it felt their reports in any way
helped the rebels' cause. Honasan had given several interviews to
local and foreign media before his arrest in a Manila suburb.
   Florendo said Honasan fled from the ``Andres Bonifacio'' prison
vessel with a navy lieutenant and 13 enlisted men. The ship was
anchored in Manila Bay about 500 yards from navy headquarters.
   They escaped in dinghies that had been sent to the ship to
increase security after reports that Honasan would try to escape.
Florendo said loyal guards fired on the fleeing boats but
apparently missed.
   Mrs. Aquino said the prison ship's captain had been arrested and
he and members of his crew would face court-martial for negligence.
   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
former colonel was so popular that he had become the dominant
figure aboard the vessel which was supposed to be his prison. He
remains widely respected in the 160,000-member armed forces even
though he has officially been dismissed from the military.
   Meanwhile, the government rushed to strengthen security in and
around the capital Saturday. Trucks and bulldozers blocked
entrances to military camps in Manila, and mobile checkpoints were
set up on roads leading north.
   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said the military was ``taking
every possible action to bring him (Honasan) back and to minimize
or neutralize any further demage that he can make.''
   Despite the crisis, presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said
Mrs. Aquino would go ahead with a visit to China, scheduled to
begin April 14.
   Honasan, a former defense ministry chief of security, played a
key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, civilian-military uprising that
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos and brought Mrs. Aquino to
power. But he later accused Mrs. Aquino of weak and inept
leadership in the face of the communist insurgency.
   In August, Honasan led 2,000 men in a coup on the presidential
palace and seized several media and military installations in the
capital. But they were driven off by pro-Aquino forces.
   It was the most serious of six major plots to unseat Mrs.
Aquino. Honasan escaped and went into hiding before his arrest four
months later. The military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted men
involved in the coup attempt remain at large.
   Mrs. Aquino said Saturday that Honasan had carried out his coup
attempt while facing investigation into misappropriation of
military equipment. She also said he wanted to avoid a combat
command.

<HEAD>Rebel Group Says It Controls Route for Famine Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ethiopian rebel group claimed Saturday
that it controls the main route for transporting food for millions
of Ethiopians facing starvation.
   Assefa Mamoa, spokesman for the Tigre People's Liberation Front,
said the road between the northernmost provinces of Tigre and
Eritrea ``is only open for humanitarian assistance.''
   ``We are calling upon the humanitarian organizations to go on
with their operations and the TPLF will guarantee their security,''
he said in a telephone call from Washington to The Associated Press
bureau in Nairobi.
   Mamoa said the front took control of the road Thursday. The
rebels' claims could not be verified, but the Soviet-backed Marxist
government in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, has acknowledged
the rebels made some advances amid heavy fighting.
   Tigre and Eritrea are the worst-hit areas in a drought that has
threatened about 7 million Ethiopians with starvation. Fighting in
both regions has disrupted emergency relief efforts.
   Because of rebel activities, the government often closes roads
in the regions, cutting off truck convoys carrying food. Most of
the food reaching Tigre comes in by road after being unloaded at
the Eritrean port of Massawa on the Red Sea.
   David Morton, director of Ethiopian operations for the World
Food Program, said a U.N. convoy used the road Monday to deliver
food to the town of Wukro and returned along the same road Tuesday.
He said both trips were without incident.
   Mamoa also claimed that government troops on Thursday abandoned
the northern Tigre town of Adigrat. The front previously announced
the capture Thursday of the towns of Axum and Adowa.
   ``The only remaining major areas held by the Ethiopian
government are the (provincial) capital, Makelle, and Maichew,''
Mamoa said. ``The situation of the Ethiopian military forces is
collapsing.''
   Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam said in a radio
broadcast Thursday that his troops were fighting ``grim battles''
against secessionist rebels in Tigre and Eritrea. It was a rare
acknowledgement.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies 13 years ago when he and a
group of fellow army officers dethroned Emperor Haile Selassie and
set up a Marxist government.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Africa's
oldest civil war. The civil war in Tigre is in its 14th year.

   A scallop fisherman's net snagged
part of a solid-fuel rocket booster in the Atlantic Ocean east of
here, and the boat brought the dangerous catch into port.
   The 1,000-pound booster piece, about 7 feet square, contained
unspent fuel that could have ignited if heated, said Dave Sargeant,
assistant fire chief of the Cape Canaveral Volunteer Fire
Department.
   Air Force spokesmen identified it as part of a Delta rocket
booster; many such rockets have been launched from the Cape
Canaveral complex.
   The 75-foot Triton II, operated by Canaveral Seafoods, netted
the motor Thursday while scalloping 22 miles east of the port, said
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Dan Brosseau.
   Brosseau said the ship's captain, Billy Phillips, notified the
Coast Guard of his cargo when he reached port Friday. Sargeant said
firefighters had some difficulty clearing the area because few
people believed the benign-looking debris was dangerous.
   ``People just didn't understand what it was they were
handling,'' Sargeant said. ``It's non-toxic until it burns.
   Air Force ordnance experts trucked the motor to the Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station, where it will be burned, said Capt.
Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman at Patrick Air Force Base.
   Warren said the debris was identified as a Castor 4 rocket
motor, a solid-fuel booster used primarily on Delta rockets.
   The booster is manufactured at a plant in Huntsville, Ala., said
Rocky Raab, manager of external affairs for Morton Thiokol Inc. in
Brigham City, Utah. The propellant, about the consistency of a
rubber eraser, will burn, but not explode, if ignited.

<HEAD>Guardsman Faces Court-Martial Over Rolling up Sleeves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Guardsman spent a night in
jail and faces a court-martial over what he says was his inability
to roll up his sleeves because his arms are too big.
   Ronald Brown, a muscular Escambia County Utilities Authority
meter reader in civilian life, was arrested Thursday by sheriff's
deputies on a warrant for failing to appear at a Feb. 23
court-martial.
   Capt. James Welsh, who will preside over the court-martial, said
he doesn't think Brown is telling everything he did wrong. Brown is
charged with disobeying an order.
   ``Think to yourself, there's got to be more to it,'' Welsh said.
Guard officials ``aren't that thin-skinned.''
   Brown, who was released Friday on orders of his battalion
commander, said he was told to roll his sleeves up while taking
down tents following an exercise last November. Brown said he was
unable to comply because his arms were too big for his shirtsleeves.
   He said that a month later he was accused by a lieutenant of
willfully disobeying an order and asked if he would voluntarily
accept an unspecified punishment. Brown said he refused and asked
to speak to a higher authority.
   He said he didn't hear anything more about it until February
when a clerk mentioned a hearing in his case, but he insisted he
never received formal notification of the court-martial.
   The Guard says three registered mail notices were sent to him.
   ``If they say I got three notices they must have been delivered
to the wrong mailbox,'' Brown said. ``The National Guard should
have just given me a phone call to tell me about the court-martial.
They've got my number.''
   Capt. Gary Griffith, commander of the 417th Signal Battalion,
said Brown failed to go to the post office to pick up the
registered letters and that he suspected the part-time soldier knew
what was in the envelopes.
   Griffith rescheduled the court-martial for May 19.

   Angolan rebels killed 57 government
soldiers and shot down a Cuban-piloted helicopter in three attacks
last week, the rebels said in a statement issued here Saturday.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which
is fighting the communist government with U.S. and South African
backing, said it killed 51 Angolan soldiers last Sunday in Tota in
the northern coffee-growing province of Lunda.
   The UNITA rebels said they captured 63 Soviet-made AK-47
automatic rifles and destroyed three trucks.
   In another attack, the group said it shot down the Soviet-built
MI-28 helicopter, killing its Cuban crew, close to the southern
town of Menongue. The statement did not say how many Cubans were on
board or give the date of the attack.
   In the third attack, the rebels said they killed six enemy
soldiers from an army patrol Monday near the town of Luma-Kassai in
Lunda province.
   The statement gave rebel casualties in the attacks as four
killed and seven wounded.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
   UNITA has been fighting since 1975 to force the Cuban- and
Soviet-backed government to share power in the former Portuguese
colony.

<HEAD>Chinese Might Join Foreign Ownersship of California Wineries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If officials in China can work out the
details, a Chinese-owned winery next year might join the growing
lineup of foreign-owned California wineries.
   ``So far China has never had a winery outside of China; we have
to make research first,'' Guo Song-Quon, chief winemaker of a
leading Chinese winery, said Friday through an interpreter.
   Guo's place of business is Tianjin's 80,000-case-a-year Heavenly
Palace Winery south of Beijing.
   Heavenly Palace has been marketing its ``Spring Moon'' brand in
the United States since September, mostly in Chinese restaurants.
The wine, a medium-dry, fruity muscat, is the only export label in
the Heavenly Palace line.
   China has been making an intensive effort to earn foreign
exchange as fast as possible, and a quality California winery _
participating in a strong premium wine boom _ would help in that
direction.
   At last count, there were 39 foreign-owned wineries out of about
650 in California.
   If the Chinese join the lineup, their foreign colleagues in this
state would include British, five wineries; Canadians, seven;
French, 11; West Germans, two; Belgians, one; Swiss, five; Spanish,
two; Japanese, five; and Thais, 1.
   Guo, the son of Guo Qichang, China's senior winemaker and a top
official of the China's Ministry of Light Industry, has been on a
whirlwind tour of California wineries this week, he said in an
interview.
   ``I will make a full report that will go back to the Chinese
government,'' said Guo, who has visited wineries in the Sonoma,
Napa and Central valleys. He expressed admiration for the
California style of winemaking.
   Especially under study, said Guo, is the American system of
wine-marketing.
   ``What is marketing?'' he said, expressing the question as a
statement. ``In China, we don't understand marketing ... even
bottling ... we have a lot of problems with bottling in China;
there is nothing modern like in California. We want China to follow
the American (wine) system.''
   Through an interpreter, Guo said preliminary plans for Chinese
investment in California wine call for an operation independent of
the government, with home winery funds and dollars borrowed from
U.S. banks.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential hopeful Michael
Dukakis on Saturday blamed Arab leaders for the failure of Middle
East peace initiatives and said he disagreed strongly with Jesse
Jackson on policies in the region.
   Positioning himself for the crucial New York primary in two
weeks, the Massachusetts governor said that the question of a
Palestinian homeland should be resolved in the direct negotiations
between Israel and its neighbors.
   ``We will reach out to those on all sides, in all countries, who
believe in a future of peace and security,'' Dukakis said in a
major foreign policy speech before about 600 people at the
University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh. ``Negotiations with the
Palestinian people are possible. Negotiations with terrorists are
not.''
   Dukakis has been reluctant to point out where he disagrees with
rival Jesse Jackson on the issues, but he did so when asked about
Jackson's embrace of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and whether the PLO
and Israel are ``morally equivalent.
   ``I don't agree with him,'' Dukakis said.
   That relatively mild statement contrasted sharply with Sen.
Albert Gore Jr.'s denunciation of Jackson's foreign policy ideas in
the same area earlier this week.
   With the speech and a later news conference, Dukakis was trying
to make certain that rival presidential hopeful Gore does not
appear more committed to Israel than he does _ a key issue with
Jewish voters who may make up a quarter of the New York electorate.
   Aides denied the speech was designed to respond to Gore but
admitted it should blunt the controversy about Gore's comments.
   On another matter, Dukakis said the United States has the full
right to defend the Panama Canal, and that he does not oppose
President Reagan's dispatch of more troops there in light of the
unrest in Panama.
   First on Saturday, Dukakis turned his attention to blue-collar
voters in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday. At a labor roundtable
in Kenosha, his approach was a combination of competence and
earthiness.
   ``My friends, this is not a lot of talk. I know how to do
things,'' the Massachusetts governor told the crowd. ``After seven
years of charisma, maybe it is time we had a little competence in
the White House.''
   Twice in his speech, Dukakis used an expletive, an unusual
action for a politican with a repuation as a controlled technocrat.
   ``Hell, I'm the only candidate in this race who has ever
balanced a budget,'' he said at one point.
   Then boasting about the benefits of full employment, Dukakis
added: ``Hell, they are paying six bucks an hour in McDonalds in my
state, because they can't get people. It's a wonderful, wonderful
thing. That's the kind of future I want to build for this country.''
   In his foreign policy speech, Dukakis touched on a range of
issues, but the biggest chunk dealt with the Middle East.
   Dukakis called for a continuation of the Camp David peace
process, which he said was the ``unfulfilled'' vision of the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and former Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin.
   ``Why? Because few Arab leaders have had the courage to see the
Middle East as Sadat saw it. Few Arab leaders have had the wisdom
to choose reconciliation over conflict, to choose hope instead of
hate; to prepare for the future rather than relive the wars of the
past,'' he said.
   Dukakis made abundantly clear his commitment to Israel.
   ``The first thing anyone must understand about the Middle East
is that we will never let Israel down,'' he said . ``For decades,
America leaders have know and the American people have understood,
that Israel's fate is our fate ... that our security interests are
linked and that our historical and cultural bonds cannot and will
not broken.
   ``Israel _ like the United States _ is a special place.''
   After support for Israel, Dukakis laid down three other tenets
of his Middle East policy.
   The second was the necessity for direct negotiations between
Israel and its neighbors.
   Third was a continuation of the Camp David understandings on the
future of the West Bank and the Gaza strip.
   ``That framework recognizes the right of the people of the
territories to shape their own destiny in a way that is consistent
with Israel's right to exist within safe and security and
recognized borders,'' he said.
   And fourth, Dukakis condemned the Soviet Union and China for
continuing a major flow of arms into the Middle East, particularly
China's sale of medium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia.
   Dukakis did not mention his dispute with Gore over a letter 30
U.S. senators signed on March 3, encouraging Secretary of State
George Shultz to pursue his peace plan and criticizing Israeli
leaders for not cooperating with the effort.
   On Central America, Dukakis praised the progress toward peace in
the region, castigating the Reagan administration for being unable
to ``cope with the threat of peace'' there.
   Dukakis also brought up U.S. policy toward South Africa where he
declared the president must ``say `no' to apartheid; `no' to
racism; ``no to doing business with South Africa.''

<HEAD>Court Chief Says Reforms Caused Increase in White-Collar Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's liberal economic reforms have caused a
major increase in economic crimes, debt cases and divorce, the
president of the Supreme People's Court said Saturday.
   Zheng Tianxiang told the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, that since a crackdown on white-collar crime began in
1983 about 760,000 people have been sentenced to punishments
ranging from a jail term of five years to execution.
   He also said there were 547,000 divorce cases last year, almost
half the 1.2 million civil cases heard.
   China's reforms, started in 1976 after the fall of the
ultra-leftist Gang of Four, have loosened state controls over
business and opened the nation to foreign influences.
   But they also have prompted the ``corrupt and ugly'' phenomenon
of nouveau riche ``upstarts who use money to seduce or philander
with women, and even take concubines,'' Zheng said.
   In addition, bribery, embezzlement and speculation have become
commonplace, he said.
   From August 1983 to the end of 1987, the nation's courts passed
judgment on 2 million people for white-collar crime. About 38
percent, or 760,000, received sentences of at least five years in
jail, he said.
   Last year the number of criminals given sentences of 10 years or
more for such crimes more than doubled, Zheng said, although he did
not provide figures.
   Zheng said that of the offenders since 1983, government
employees made up 15 percent while 28 percent were factory workers.
   Zheng did not say how many people were sentenced to die.
   Foreign analysts have estimated that more than 10,000 people
have been executed since 1983, but China has never released figures
on capital punishment. It is unclear how many people were executed
for white-collar crime.
   Zheng said the growth of nongovernmental loans, many without
written contracts and with high interest rates, has led to a sharp
jump in debt cases. Last year, there were 256,000 cases, eight
times the 1983 figure.
   Divorce cases are also up, he said, partly because women have
become more economically independent under the government's reform
policies.
   Some women with greater economic means ``cannot bear the bond of
arranged marriage or maltreatment by their husband, thus demanding
divorces. Their demand is progressive and the people's courts give
them full support according to law,'' he said.
   In a separate speech, Yang Yichen, head of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, or prosecutor's office, said 1,500 leading officials
had been prosecuted over the past five years for such crimes as tax
evasion, trademark counterfeits and manufacturing fake and faulty
commodities.
   Zheng said the courts continued to deal with cases of people
wronged during the leftist anarchy of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution. He said courts had taken up 789,000 related criminal
cases, and new verdicts were given in 286,000 cases.

   An organization of Libyan exiles opposed to
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Saturday an army officer
had defected and denounced ``Gadhafi's bloody rule.''
   The statement was distributed by the Cairo-based National Front
for the Salvation of Libya _ NFSL.
   It said Libyan Lt. Col. Abdallah Ahmed Khaled al-Sheikhy had
joined the NFSL because it is ``the honorable force struggling to
overthrow Gahafi's bloody rule.''
   The statement was not signed by the officer and there was no way
to independently verity the claim.
   The NFSL has reported two other defections of Libyan colonels in
the past nine days, but did not say where the officers were.
   A Salvation of Libya statement on March 30 was signed by Col.
Saleh Mohammed and said he had joined the NFSL.
   Five days earlier, a statement said the chief of Libya's forces
in Chad, Col. Khalifah Abu el-Kassem Haftar, had defected to the
NFSL. The statement gave no details but an NFSL spokesman said
Haftar had been a prisoner of war in Chad.
   Libya claims a large zone of northern Chad and the dispute has
provoked frequent battles between the North African neighbors.
Gadhafi also backs Chadian rebel forces.

<TEXT>
   The 500-foot highway of steel over the
Little Missouri River is more than just a bridge to this small
village on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.
   This one possesses personality, they say, so much so they refer
to it by name _ Lost Bridge.
   The 20-foot-wide, three-span truss bridge was erected in 1929
when it only connected two dusty cattle trails, said Bill Jennings,
assistant bridge engineer for the state Highway Department.
   ``They built a bridge that had no access to it,'' said Lisa
Redford, a spokesman for Mandaree Inc.
   Now that state Highway 22 crosses the bridge, the state wants to
build a replacement, and Mandaree Inc. hopes to preserve the old
span as a focus for development.
   People old enough to remember its origin are still baffled. ``I
don't even know why they built it,'' Fred Lone Fight said.
   Nobody used Lost Bridge before Garrison Dam was built downstream
in the 1950s and Lake Sakakawea blocked many roads, Pamela Black
Hawk recalled.
   Eventually, Highway 22 became a paved ribbon of asphalt and the
bridge, part of the shortest western route around the lake, got far
more use. The state wants to replace it with a modern bridge that's
16 feet wider and can carry heavier loads, Jennings said.
   So the state is searching for a buyer for the steel structure
and is offering $50,000 to aid in moving it. If no one takes the
bridge, it will be torn down.
   Mandaree Inc. is exploring the possibility of essentially
adopting the bridge. The group envisions using it for a fishing
site, the focal point of a place for prairie-weary travelers to
stop for rest or a picnic, said Redford.
   That would preserve Lost Bridge for its historic and sentimental
importance, she said.
   The bridge sits 10 miles south of Mandaree in a picturesque
valley of rolling river bluffs that are void of any man-made
structures except for the highway itself and an occasional highway
sign.
   Driving into the valley, the sun-drenched metal bridge glistens
as it stands against a backdrop of prairie grass.
   Any group that agrees to preserve the bridge gets at least
$50,000 _ the estimated expense for tearing it down _ from the
state, Jennings said.
   The deadline for assuming ownership of bridge is November, he
said. Mandaree Inc. hopes to make a decision within the next few
weeks, Redford said.
   ``We are looking right now into the liabilities and what the
federal guidelines call for in maintaining a (historic) bridge,''
said Redford.
   ``The history is what makes it unique,'' Jennings said. ``The
fact they call it a lost bridge.''
   A new bridge just west of Lost Bridge will cost an estimated $1
million, he said. The state hopes to begin construction in 1990.
   In the early 1970s, the state tried to give away a rainbow-arch
bridge over the Cannonball River but found no takers, Jennings
recalled.
   ``They took a lot of pictures, wrote up quite a documentary on
it, and destroyed the bridge,'' he said.

<HEAD>China Announces Election Procedures That Permit More Candidates
Than Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's legislature blew a small breath of
democracy into the government on Saturday by approving a bill that
for the first time allows candidates to compete for seats on its
standing committee.
   From now on, the 2,794 delegates to the National People's
Congress will elect its 155-member standing committee.
   As before, 20 candidates, including the chairman and vice
chairmen, will be chosen by the Congress' ruling Presidium and
elected without opposition, but now 144 candidates will compete for
the other 135 seats.
   Deputies can vote against a candidate or abstain, but the 20
without opposition can be defeated only if they get fewer than half
of votes cast.
   Only two delegates opposed and one abstained in the vote to
approve the procedure.
   The Congress ruled out more than one candidate for such posts as
president and vice president, Congress chairman, chairman of the
Central Military Commission and president of the Supreme People's
Court.
   It said the Presidium will fill those key posts ``in line with
the opinions of the majority of deputies.''
   The Presidium will also elect the premier, vice premiers,
ministers, state councilors and other government officers, with a
single candidate for each post submitted by the president.
   Acting Premier Li Peng is certain to be formally named head of
government.
   China says the current session of the Congress has been the most
open and democratic ever. Official newspapers and national
television have spotlighted debate among the delegates and speeches
voicing opposition to various policies.
   Still, the Communist Party and its governing Politburo remain in
firm control over decisions of policy and personnel. The Congress'
main function is still to rubber-stamp moves by the party.

   Iraq said Saturday its forces killed
thousands of Iranian troops and overran bases of Iranian-backed
Kurdish rebels in mountainous northeastern Iraq.
   Iranian warplanes bombed an Iraqi garrison in the region, Tehran
radio reported, but Iran's news media had no immediate comment on
the Iraqi victory claim.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Iraqi forces
were leveling the Kurdish town of Seyyed Sadiq in Sulaymaniyah
province and its inhabitants were seeking refuge in nearby towns.
   Kurdish separatist leader Jalal Talabani confirmed there was
heavy fighting and said Iraq was ``waging a genocide campaign
against our people through the daily use of poison gas.''
   A tenuous halt in the ``war of the cities'' held as Iraq
continued to silence its long-range missile launchers for the
duration of a trip to Baghdad by Turkish Prime Minister Turgut
Ozal. Iran did not report any attacks on civilian targets either.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz reaffirmed his nation's
readiness to continue the halt even after Ozal returns to Turkey,
probably Sunday evening, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
   But it quoted him as saying the truce would continue only if
Iran accepted several Iraqi demands, including an Iranian
withdrawal from Iraqi territory, that Iran has repeatedly scoffed
at.
   Kuwait's ruler issued a new appeal to Iran to end the war with
Iraq through negotiations.
   Baghdad radio quoted a high command communique as saying Iraqi
troops ``completely purged'' the area around Qara Dagh in the
Sulaymaniyah region of Iraq in the last two weeks.
   Qala Dagh is only 20 miles west of Lake Darbandikhan, where
Iranian Revolutionary Guards have thrust into Iraq in a 16-day-old
offensive.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted its correspondent as saying
thousands of Iranians were killed. He did not give figures for
casualties among the Kurdish guerrillas.
   The correspondent also specifically denied a report, carried
Friday by The Associated Press, that Kurdish rebels were within
five miles of a major highway linking Sulaymaniyah with other Iraqi
cities.
   The communique quoted by Baghdad radio said ``all traitors have
finally been destroyed,'' in a reference to the Iranian-backed
Kurdish rebels who have been fighting Baghdad for an independent
homeland for years.
   It said an Iraqi force, including Kurdish fighters loyal to
Baghdad, had overrun 21 Kurdish bases and villages used by the
guerrillas in the last few days.
   Tehran radio said Iranian warplanes bombed an Iraqi garrison at
Shanandari, in the heart of the area of hostilities, ``inflicting
heavy losses and damage.''
   Talabani, leader of one of the two main Kurdish rebel groups,
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said an Iraqi chemical attack on
the village of Seo-o-Saru earlier last week killed 60 Kurdish
villagers and wounded 211.
   ``They are now resorting to a scorched-earth policy, killing
defenseless women and children indiscriminately and destroying
whole villages,'' he said in London on Friday.
   IRNA reported that Iranian troops who were nearby heard
``several huge explosions'' coming from Seyyed Sadiq on Saturday
and ``many buildings in the Iraqi town have been demolished.''
   It said groups of inhabitants were escaping from the town to
nearby towns and villages.
   Massud Barzani, leader of the other big rebel group, the Kurdish
Democratic Party, had said several days ago that the Iraqi army
launched a major offensive against the guerrillas March 23.
   He said two divisions of troops, backed by tanks, artillery and
air strikes, were seeking to dislodge rebel fighters and their
allies, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, from the Qara Dagh
mountains between Kirkuk and the provincial capital of Sulaymaniyah.
   An Iraqi division usually numbers about 12,000 men.
   The villages are north of the Iranian bridgehead around Lake
Darbandikhan, where Iran claims Iraqi chemical bombing attacks
March 16-17 on ``liberated'' Kurdish towns killed 5,000 civilians
and injured 5,000 more.
   Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said in an
address at the inauguration of the sixth conference of Arab justice
ministers, ``Judging by Islamic and Arab history, we find that
inter-Islamic wars did not provide any radical solution to
problems.''
   He called on Iran ``to abide by the Islamic teachings, stick to
good neighborliness and accept reconciliation and dialogue instead
of aggression and the continuation of war and destruction.''
   Sheik Jaber's peace appeal came only three days after three
Iranian gunboats opened fire on a military post on Kuwait's Bubiyan
Island, wounding two Kuwaiti soldiers.

   The daring prison escape of the
leader of the August coup attempt raised new doubts about military
leadership under President Corazon Aquino's government.
   The flight Saturday of former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, with 14 prison guards from an elite navy unit, came four
days after the military boasted of the arrest of seven top
communist rebels.
   ``How was it possible, because he was on a ship and under
guard?'' Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said of the escape. ``How could it
happen?''
   Honasan, 39, served as security chief when Enrile, now an
opposition leader, was minister of defense.
   Before dawn Saturday, Honasan fled the prison ship where he had
been held since his capture in December. The 14 officers from the
navy's special warfare unit were supposed to be guarding him, but
they fled with him.
   Honasan and the guards escaped under gunfire from other guards
and reached shore in two rubber dinghies a few hundred yards from
navy headquarters.
   In what may be worse for the military's image, spokesman Col.
Oscar Florendo acknowledged the armed forces learned last week of a
possible escape attempt and had doubled the guard force on the
ship. The dinghies had come with the increased security.
   Mrs. Aquino announced Saturday that the vessel's commander, Lt.
Cmdr. Fred Tuvilla, had been arrested and may face court-martial
for negligence.
   She also threatened to punish any soldiers who help Honasan. He
and other military dissidents were responsible for six major coup
plots against her government.
   Florendo said Honasan was apt to try to organize new plots
against the government and to divide the 160,000-member military.
The charismatic former colonel remains widely admired in the
military even though he was dismissed after his Aug. 28 coup
attempt left at least 53 people dead.
   His escape was widely reported Saturday in the Filipino media,
which normally curtail operations on Easter weekend. Scores of
callers to Manila radio stations questioned how Honasan could have
escaped without the help of the guards.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa told reporters
Saturday he accepted responsibility for the escape but would let
Mrs. Aquino decide whether he should be relieved.
   ``Somehow, in one way or another, I bear responsibility for
ensuring that our detainees are secured and procedures are
followed,'' he said.
   Last month, the congressional Commission on Appointments
approved de Villa's nomination as chief of staff.
   The move came despite opposition from some congressmen who felt
the former Constabulary commander should have retired instead.
Critics said extending his tour of duty limited promotion of
younger officers and smacked of practices under ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   The escape also raised doubts whether the congressional
commission would approve the recent nomination of Adm. Carlito
Cunanan, former chief of the Coast Guard, as navy commander.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they already had misgivings about Cunanan because of the Coast
Guard's inept handling of rescue efforts in a December collision of
a Filipino passenger ship and oil tanker that killed 3,000 people.
   The escape took place as the military was enjoying new prestige
for Tuesday's arrest of seven leading communists, including Romulo
Kintanar, commander of the rebel New People's Army.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos had said the arrests showed that
the military had overcome past divisions and could now act
effectively.
   But on Saturday, he called the escape ``disturbing news.''
   De Villa said the search for Honasan, moreover, would divert
military resources from the fight against the rebels.
   One Filipino politician also worried about the international
impact of Honasan's escape. Sen. John Osmena said it was bound to
tarnish the government's image abroad and raise more doubts about
the stability of the Aquino administration.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of West Germans
joined Saturday in the annual Easter weekend marches to demand the
elimination of all nuclear weapons and the closure of nuclear power
plants.
   Organizers said marches were held in all of the nation's major
cities and there also were vigils near the sites where two jet
fighters of West Germany's allies crashed last week.
   No estimate of the number of people participating in the marches
was given. Police reported the demonstrations were peaceful.
   A French Mirage jet crashed Wednesday within a mile of a nuclear
power plant in Bavaria state, killing the pilot.
   A U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter crashed into the small town of
Forst on Thursday and the pilot and a resident were killed.
   The F-16 went down about eight miles from a nuclear power
station. Officials said such crashes posed no danger of an accident
at nuclear power facilities because thick concrete domes shield the
reactors.
   March organizers said more anti-nuclear demonstrations will be
held Sunday.

   If fallen evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
fails to quickly reverse his defiance and accept a year-long bar on
preaching and television appearances demanded by the Assemblies of
God, the church will move to dismiss him, officials say.
   Swaggart, whose worldwide ministry is scrambling to overcome
financial problems, has said he will defy the church order and
preach again on May 22, only three months after he confessed to
unspecified sins.
   A rift between the church's leaders over how to discipline
Swaggart was settled Friday when the Louisiana District Council
announced it would not contest stern sanctions ordered by the
Assemblies' General Presbytery.
   The church's General Presbytery, meeting at its national
headquarters in Springfield, Mo., on Tuesday banned Swaggart from
the pulpit for at least a year for ``moral failure'' that
reportedly included hiring a prostitute to pose nude.
   On Friday, Louisiana church officials said they would go along
with the order despite their own recommendation that Swaggart be
barred from preaching for only three months.
   ``I would hope he would see the wisdom of submitting himself to
the judgment of his brothers because there is a strong desire ...
to be helpful to the man,'' said the Rev. Thomas Zimmerman, the
Assemblies' retired general superintendent.
   On Feb. 21, Swaggart tearfully confessed to unspecified sins and
stepped down from the pulpit.
   On Wednesday, he announced through his attorney that he would
return to the pulpit May 22 _ the end of the three-month suspension
recommended by the state council _ in defiance of the national
leadership.
   ``What was said at the Wednesday press conference still holds,''
Swaggart spokesman Gus Weill said Friday. ``Reverend Swaggart is
still planning to return to the pulpit May 22 and we're still
examining the rights to appeal.''
   Church bylaws, however, do not allow ministers to appeal
rehabilitation decisions, said Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman at the
Assemblies' national headquarters.
   ``If they haven't heard from him (Swaggart) in a few days, a
reasonable period of time, they'll assume he is rejecting their
offer. In that case, they would move immediately to dismiss him,''
she said.
   The national office expected to hear from Swaggart on Monday,
Mrs. Turnage said.
   Swaggart's ministry is not controlled by the Assemblies of God.
Officials have said the credentials of the organization's ministers
are the only direct link with the Assemblies, the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination.
   Bill Treeby, Swaggart's lawyer, said lack of denomination
credentials would not affect the ministry's operations.
   Television appears to be the lifeline for Swaggart's ministry,
which includes worldwide missionary and hospital programs, a Bible
college and a worship center that seats 5,000.
   Ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Swaggart's average
viewership dropped from more than 1 million households in November
1986 to 860,000 homes a year later as he lost his position as the
most-watched TV preacher.
   Swaggart's ministry conducted a telethon in mid-March in which
the evangelist's wife Frances and son Donnie warned that many
programs faced cancellation. Ministry officials have refused to
reveal how much money was raised through the telethon.
   The March issue of the ministry's magazine, The Evangelist, said
the organization faced a $14.7 million deficit through February,
before the sex scandal surfaced. The magazine's April edition was
about half the size of those published in previous months.
   The ministry's bank account was overdrawn by $2 million,
Swaggart said in a March 19 appeal for funds sent to supporters.
   The organization recently mortgaged more than 100 acres of
property to cover a suspended connstruction project and to secure a
$20 million line of credit.
   Swaggart's ministry has contributed between $10.3 million and
$11.4 million annually over the past three years to the Assemblies'
foreign missions program, Turnage said.
   ``There have been indications that a number of people sending
money to individual organizations ... will now send through the
church where there is accountability and they know what the money
is used for,'' she said.

   A storm centered over Kansas spread rain and thunderstorms up
and down the Mississippi Valley on Saturday, causing floods and
tornadoes in Louisiana and trailing heavy snow across the western
Great Plains.
   Heavy rain accompanied showers and thunderstorms across southern
Louisiana into southern Alabama during the morning.
   Widespread street flooding was reported across the New Orleans
area and north of Lake Pontchartrain. Rainfall amounts in the New
Orleans area ranged up to 9 inches since Friday evening, with 8.17
inches at Gretna and 6.09 inches at Gramercy. In east-central
Louisiana, 5.65 inches fell at Bayou Sorrel.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2.08 inches of rain fell
at New Orleans' Lakefront Airport.
   Strong thunderstorms developed during the afternoon across parts
of eastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois. Showers were scattered
from western Nebraska through southern Minnesota and northern
Illinois, with most rain amounts less than an inch.
   Snow and blowing snow made travel difficult in northwestern
Kansas and northeastern Colorado, and most roads in the western two
counties of the Oklahoma Panhandle were closed.
   Snow amounts included 13 inches at Goodland, Kan.; 22 at Timpas,
Colo.; 20 at Walsh, Colo.; and up to 23 inches in the Oklahoma
Panhandle, according to highway officials and the National Weather
Service.
   Drifts 4 to 5 feet high and wind gusting to 40 mph were reported
across southeastern Colorado, the weeather service said.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered across the Pacific Northwest
as another storm system approached the coast.
   Showers were scattered across parts of eastern Georgia extending
into northeastern Florida. Showers also developed over parts of the
upper Ohio Valley.
   Dense morning fog slowed travel across northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin into northern Indiana.
   The fog halted landings at Chicago's O'Hare airport for about
two hours early in the morning, said Joe Hopkins of United
Airlines, the airport's largest carrier. By 9:30 a.m., when
visibility was about a quarter of a mile at O'Hare, United had
cancelled about 90 flights out of 800 scheduled because of the fog,
he said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 33
degrees at Imperial, Neb., to 86 at Thermal, Calif. The low for the
day was 10 degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo.
   For Sunday, widespread showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Great Lakes through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the
central Gulf of Mexico coast. Widespread showers also were forecast
over the northern Pacific Coast with scattered showers inland.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted from northeastern Minnesota into
Upper Michigan; in the 50s across south-central and eastern
Colorado, the upper Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes and
much of New England, and across the Pacific Northwest; in the 80s
from the desert Southwest across southern Texas into the lower
Mississippi Valley, and across much of the Florida Peninsula; and
in the 60s or 70s across much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Poll: Dukakis Holds Small Lead Over Jackson In Wisconsin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis held a
narrow lead over the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the week leading up to
Tuesday's Wisconsin presidential primary, according to a newspaper
poll published Sunday.
   Dukakis held a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over Jackson among
voters who said they would vote for, or leaned toward, a Democratic
candidate if the primary had been held at the time of the poll, The
Milwaukee Journal reported in its Sunday editions.
   In a poll two weeks earlier, Dukakis led Jackson by 38 percent
to 30 percent, the newspaper reported.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee, made the largest gain in the
two-week period between polls, increasing his support from 10
percent to 15 percent, the newspaper said.
   Despite campaigning heavily in Wisconsin, Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois slipped from 11 percent support to 5 percent in the two
weeks, the newspaper said.
   Simon has pinned his fading presidential prospects on Wisconsin,
hoping that a victory in the primary would give him a boost going
into next week's primary in New York.
   On the Republican side, the poll showed Vice President George
Bush would easily defeat his remaining primary challenger, former
television evangelist Pat Robertson but might have a difficult time
winning Wisconsin in the general election if Dukakis were the
Democratic nominee.
   Bush held an 80 percent to 7 percent lead over Robertson, the
poll showed.
   However, Bush and Dukakis ended in a virtual tie among voters
who were asked which of the two they would likely vote for in the
general election in November.
   In similar matchups, Bush held a 5 point lead over Gore and a 14
point lead over Jackson, the newspaper said.
   The poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday and was based on
interviews with 845 randomly-selected Wisconsin adults who said
they were absolutely or fairly certain to vote in the primary, the
newspaper said. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
   The Wisconsin primary is expected to draw a large voter turnout
with as many as 1.6 million voters or 45 percent of the eligible
voters participating, state Elections Board officials said.

<HEAD>Impeachment Verdict Won't End Arizona's Legal Morass</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This week's expected verdict in Gov. Evan
Mecham's impeachment trial won't necessarily end the legal morass
that surrounds the Arizona governorship.
   The Senate plans to vote Monday or Tuesday on whether Mecham, a
first-term Republican, should be the first Arizona governor removed
from office.
   Senators heard five weeks of testimony on allegations that
Mecham misused $80,000 in state money by loaning it to his auto
dealership, and that he tried to thwart an investigation of an
alleged death threat by a state official.
   With 20 of the 30 Senate votes required for conviction, nobody
is predicting what will happen.
   If he is acquitted, Mecham will automatically regain the
gubernatorial powers he gave up to Acting Gov. Rose Mofford, the
Democratic secretary of state, when he was impeached by the House
Feb. 5.
   If the Senate convicts him on either count, Mecham will be
removed from office immediately.
   In either event, the matter won't necessarily end there.
   If acquitted, Mecham faces two more battles to keep the
governorship.
   A criminal trial is due to start April 21 on a charge similar to
one impeachment charge the Senate dropped: failure to report a
$350,000 campaign loan. The governor faces six felony counts of
fraud, perjury and filing false documents, and his brother and 1986
campaign treasurer, Willard Mecham, faces three similar counts.
   Senators who voted to drop the impeachment count said they
feared that if they heard evidence on the charge it would
jeopardize Mecham's right to a fair trial.
   If convicted in the criminal trial, Mecham would be removed from
office automatically and could face up to 22 years in prison.
   Mecham also is running against six candidates in a recall
election May 17. Polls vary widely, with some showing him far
behind but one putting Mecham and Mrs. Mofford in a dead heat for
first place.
   If the Senate votes to oust him, the governor and his defense
attorney, Jerris Leonard, say they could appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court on grounds that Mecham's constitutional rights were violated.
   It's also unclear whether the May 17 recall must be held if the
state Senate convicts Mecham on the impeachment charges.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin, a Republican, said Friday he
believes the recall still must be held because the Arizona
Constitution says a recall is aimed at the office, not the
officeholder.
   However, Corbin said he philosophically opposes holding the
recall if Mecham has already been removed.
   ``I don't think our founding fathers who drafted the
Constitution ever dreamed we would be in this position,'' he said.
   This and other remaining legal questions should be settled in
court, Corbin said.
   If the recall were to go ahead following a Senate conviction,
officials say it's also unclear whether Mecham would be allowed to
run.
   He has an automatic spot on the ballot, but Paul Bender, dean of
the Arizona State University law school, argues that a Senate vote
to remove him would apply to the entire four-year term and he could
not remain in office even if he won the recall vote.
   Legal questions surround Mrs. Mofford's gubernatorial candidacy
too. A campaign was formed to draft her because Arizona's ``resign
to run'' law apparently would require her to quit as acting
governor and secretary of state if she declared her candidacy.
   A court challenge has been mounted to see if the Mofford draft
campaign was handled properly, without any involvement by the
intended candidate.
   Corbin said his office warned years ago that the laws were
unclear and should be straightened out, ``and nobody has, so here
we are.''

   Jesse Jackson
overwhelmed Michael Dukakis in Democratic Party caucuses Saturday
to win three of the Virgin Islands' delegate votes at the national
convention.
   Party vice chairman St. Claire Williams said Jackson got 634
votes while Dukakis trailed with only 37 votes. They were the only
two candidates on the caucus ballot.
   Six people, each casting one-half vote at the convention, were
chosen in the caucuses held on the islands of St. Thomas and St.
Croix.
   Some 18,000 registered Democrats live in this U.S. territory,
whose three major islands are St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John.
   St. John Democrats traveled to St. Thomas to attend the caucus.
   Saturday's caucuses were the only step in the Democrats' process
to pick national convention delegates from the Virgin Islands.
Party members register their support by showing up at a caucus site
and filling out a sign-in sheet, which is similar to casting a
ballot in a primary.
   In addition to the six people being selected Saturday, four
members of the Democratic National Committee from the Virgin
Islands, including Gov. Alexander Farrelly, automatically will be
delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta July
18-21. Those four DNC members each cast one-quarter vote at the
convention.
   In all, the Virgin Islands' delegation will cast four votes at
the national convention.
   Republicans in the U.S. Virgin Islands pick their four national
convention delegates at a territorial convention on May 21.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While suds, sun and sin may prevail
among much of the spring break throngs on the wide beaches of
Daytona this Easter weekend, morning devotions replace hangovers in
at least three beach hotels.
   Daytona Beach has become a mecca for spring break in recent
years, and an estimated 500,000 students descend on the area to
forget classwork and laze in the sun. But it's not all rowdy
parties and promiscuity.
   At the beachfront El Caribe Hotel, students carry Bibles through
the lobby. The hotel caters to members of the Campus Crusade for
Christ, a national interdenominational group.
   ``You can only get so drunk and sunburned and bored,'' said
Cliff Mills, director of Operation Sonshine of the Campus Crusade.
``A lot of them want to know more about Christ.''
   Mills, whose organization has conducted conferences for some
3,000 students during spring break, said Campus Crusade members
take their Gospel message to the beach in the afternoons and that
sun worshipers are often receptive.
   El Caribe does not allow unchaperoned non-member students under
21 to rent rooms during spring break.
   ``The difference is day and night,'' said El Caribe owner Mary
Ann Richardson, explaining how students in her hotel act compared
with students staying at the dozens of other beach hotels.
   Ms. Richardson said the biggest problem in her hotel is minor
noise making, and that the students are generally well-behaved and
polite.
   The situation was much the same at The Desert Inn and the High
Seas Motel, also spring break gathering places for Campus Crusade
members.
   ``There was no muss, no fuss and no beer-bottle throwing,'' said
Anne Madorsky, a part-owner of the Desert Inn, the Voyager and
Americana hotels.
   Many of the crowds at Daytona used to go to Fort Lauderdale
before that community began to try to change its image with
stricter law enforcement.
   Officials in Fort Lauderdale have estimated their crowds will
range between 100,000 and 200,000 this year, compared with 350,000
in 1985.
   Daytona officials say this spring break, students generally have
behaved better than in the past, when hotel guests tossed such
objects as unopened beer cans, room chairs and even rollaway beds
from balconies.
   So far this year, there have been two spring break fatalities in
Daytona, one a 24-year-old man, not a student, who fell from a
balcony, the other a 21-year-old student who was hit by a car.
   There were five other balcony falls this year in Daytona, but
only two of the six involved students and most resulted in only
minor injuries. In the past three years, six deaths have resulted
from balcony accidents.
   In the Florida Panhandle, two spring break visitors were
hospitalized after balcony falls Friday in Destin, a Gulf Coast
resort town.
   David Jeffers, 26, of Atlanta, fell while doing pullups from a
fifth-floor balcony railing, authorities said. He was listed in
guarded condition at Humana Hospital in Fort Walton Beach.
   David McGee, 18, of Baton Rouge, who fell three floors, was in
stable condition at the same hospital.
   Evelyn Fine, executive director of the Mid-Florida Research and
Business Center of Daytona Beach Community College, said some
500,000 students have come to Daytona for spring break this year
and 330,000 will have lodged in a hotel for an average stay of
about five days.
   She predicted that each student spends an average of $375, not
including transportation, for a direct-dollar impact of $123.7
million on the Daytona Beach economy.

<HEAD>Panama's Easter Joy Dampened by Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts 2d graf to clarify that packets contained incense</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The incense vendor accepted a poor
woman's coins and spooned tiny measures of powdered red sandalwood,
honey-crystal myrrh and dried rosemary into scraps of paper.
   ``Thirty cents,'' lamented Miguel Valencia, appraising the three
dimes paid for the incense. ``This is the worst year ever.''
   The tall, ebony-skinned man, who peddles crosses and other piety
objects, said he has sold only a $1 portrait of Jesus Christ since
midweek.
   Holy Week is usually the best time of year for Valencia and the
small business he runs from a rickety stand in front of the
Metropolitan Cathedral. Indeed, the Easter holiday usually brings
joy throughout this country where about 95 percent of 2.2 million
people are Roman Catholic.
   But an economic and social crisis over the rule of military
chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has cast a pall over this year's
celebration.
   Gen. Noriega, under drug-trafficking charges in the United
States, has moved to consolidate control despite increasing U.S.
pressure on him to step down and leave the country.
   He closed banks a month ago to prevent a cash panic after
Washington froze Panamanian assets in the United States. The
government has failed to pay most of its 130,000 workers, and
private employees have nowhere to cash their checks. The money
crisis worsened nationwide hunger and unemployment.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been stepping up its military
presence in Panama, though administration officials say they don't
intend to use force to oust the strongman they once backed. Another
1,300 military personnel will arrive Tuesday, bringing to nearly
12,000 the number of U.S. troops there.
   The administration says the troops are intended to protect U.S.
bases and 45,000 Americans living in Panama.
   ``Never have we Panamanians lived a Lent with such tension,
division and increasing want in great sectors of the country,''
said a Catholic church statement. ``The people suffer and await the
Feast of the Resurrection, that it may signal some light of hope.''
   Few Panamanians saw cause for optimism. The church said Saturday
that opposition leaders had accepted a church role as mediator in
the country's travail. But the opposition continued to demand that
Noriega leave the country, something he has doggedly refused to do.
   Many people in the streets expressed despair over unremitting
price increases and hunger. Fresh fish, a typical Easter meal in
years past, has risen beyond modest means in this isthmus between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Many hunkered down in the capital of Panama City, forgoing
customary visits with family in the provinces to protect
diminishing savings. Department of Transportation agent Roger
Chacon said outbound traffic through La Chorrera, the main gate to
the countryside, was extremely light all week.
   External calm replaced weeks of political activity and
demonstrations in Panama City. Police replaced the heavily armed
Defense Forces soldiers on the street Friday for the first time
since an unsuccessful March 16 coup attempt against Noriega.
   Five men conversed on 17th Street downtown. Two sat on a
workshop bench carried out to the sidewalk and three others stood
while all sipped a mixture of rum, milk and ice from paper cups.
   ``None of us would be here now if it weren't for the crisis,''
said a man in a sleeveless T-shirt and shorts. ``We'd be in
Chiriqui where it's cool.''
   The mountainous western province is a favorite tourist spot in
better times.
   ``So our recreation is conversation and a couple drinks,'' said
another in a blue ``guayabera,'' the loose-fitting tropical shirt.
   Inevitably, talk turned to the crisis. All five said they
opposed Noriega. One suggested that ``out of the 2 million
Panamanians, 200 support him.''
   Because of fear of reprisals, none wanted his name published.
   Some of the men also talked bitterly of how U.S. sanctions were
making their holiday and their lives difficult.
   ``Panama has been a good friend to the United States for more
than 80 years,'' said one. ``And it hurts more to be wounded by a
friend.''
   And all doubted that the population, stymied by government
repression, could do much to change things after the holiday.

<HEAD>Families Await Word on Fate of Divers Held by Indonesia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The families of six California scuba divers
arrested in Indonesia nearly two weeks ago say they are still
anxiously awaiting word on whether the men will be charged with
crimes for allegedly entering restricted waters.
   Indonesian authorities suspect the six were seeking valuables
from a Dutch ship that sank more than 200 years ago, according to
Ruth van Heuven, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Consular
Affairs in Washington, D.C.
   ``Our lives are at a standstill. We all live hooked to our
phones,'' said Jennifer Craft, wife of one of the men taken into
custody March 22 when Indonesian authorities boarded the boat they
chartered in Singapore.
   In addition to the six Californians, three Australians, a Briton
and an Iranian were also aboard the Budi Indah, according to Julie
Meldrum, an Australian Embassy spokeswoman.
   The divers are being held until the investigation is completed.
   Sophisticated sonar equipment found on the boat added to
authorities' suspicion about the group, Ms. van Heuven said.
   Joseph Yun, an American vice-consul in the North Sumatra capital
of Medan, said the detained Americans contended they were in
international waters.
   ``As of yet there have been no formal charges filed against the
divers,'' Ms. van Heuven said in an interview last week.
   ``They are in good condition and have no complaints about
maltreatment,'' said James Alleckson Brown, a U.S. embassy
spokesman in Jakarta.
   Mrs. Craft said Indonesian officials have told her the country
does not hold a person for more than 20 days without bringing
formal charges.
   U.S. and Australian embassy officials said last week they were
still trying to establish the facts surrounding the incident.
Indonesian officials in the Department of Communications, the
Foreign Office and the navy would not make any comment.
   One of the six, Cliff Craft, 43, a building inspector from
Whittier, faces misdemeanor charges in California in the pillaging
of an underwater wreck off Channel Islands National Park, said
Allan Gordon, a Ventura County deputy district attorney.
   Debi Commerford of Orange, the wife of another diver, said none
of the six in Indonesia was looking for treasure. She said her
husband, Danny, and Craft were there to start a building inspection
business in Singapore and to dive with the others for recreation.
   The others from California have been identified as Patrick
Gibson, 47, a systems analyst from Van Nuys; Jim Vorus of Santa
Monica, and Bob and Bruce Lanhan of Pleasant Hill.

<HEAD>NRA Blasts Appointed Police Chief For `Campaign Against Gun
Owners'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association is
trying to get this city's interim police chief ousted, saying he
unfairly charged a service station owner with illegal possession of
a handgun after a robbery.
   In a letter mailed to NRA members here Friday, one of the
organization's national directors asks for help in keeping Keith
Bergstrom ``from bringing his campaign against law-abiding gun
owners to Tarpon Springs.''
   The letter told members they should to voice their opposition
Tuesday when city commissioners meet to consider permanently
appointing Bergstrom as chief.
   In question is Bergstrom's enforcement of an anti-gun ordinance
while he was police chief in Oak Park, Ill. An April 1984 measure
banned possession of a handgun within the city limits.
   ``I find it very ironic that the NRA in effect is criticizing me
for obeying the law and being accountable to the people who make
the law,'' Bergstrom said Friday.
   Oak Park police charged service station owner Don Bennett with
violating the ordinance when, following a robbery at his station in
1986, he chased the suspects and fired at them with a .45-caliber
pistol, Bergstrom said.
   Bennett ultimately was acquitted.
   ``The police department and their attorneys spent all of their
efforts in prosecuting Don Bennett and there was never an attempt
to find the robbers,'' said Theodore A. Lattanzio, the
Washington-based NRA official who wrote the letter. ``They were
trying to prosecute a man who tried to use a weapon in
self-defense.''
   Bergstrom, who came to Tarpon Springs in October 1987, denied
the NRA accusations.
   Bennett has filed a federal lawsuit naming Bergstrom, two Oak
Park police officers and another city official and seeking more
than $2 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive
damages from each defendant.
   The lawsuit alleges the defendants were part of a conspiracy to
prevent him from doing business, Bennett said Friday.

<HEAD>Florist Says He May Halt Live Easter Bunny Display</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 60-year-old Easter tradition _ a sidewalk
display of live Easter bunnies _ may bow to protests and be gone
next year, the florist who sets it up said Saturday.
   ``It will be determined by the public. If they want us to have
the rabbits next year, we suggest that they write in to us,'' said
Arthur Scheinuk, owner of Scheinuk The Florist.
   He said he wanted tangible support for the display, not just
comments from people who walk into the store.
   ``Just to come here and say, `I was here as a young kid and now
I'm bringing my grandchildren,' without bringing some moral support
_ you ... get a little disgusted.''
   The fenced-in display, in which dozens of adult and baby rabbits
hop around a lawn or snuggle in wooden boxes cut to resemble
buildings along St. Charles Ave., opens 10 days before Easter and
lasts until Easter Sunday.
   Scheinuk said thousands of adults and children come to look at
the rabbits every year. Some buy them for $10.90 each _ a price at
which Scheinuk said he makes no profit.
   For the past several years, the display also has attracted
pickets, people who say selling live rabbits for Easter gifts
amounts to animal cruelty because the bunnies all too often wind up
at animal shelters.
   ``We suggested to them they would do beter telling unwed mothers
how to take care of their children,'' Scheinuk said.
   To add injury to insult, 15 rabbits were stolen late Thursday or
early Friday by someone who cut an 8-inch-square hole in the
chain-link cage.
   ``In this weather that we've had, these flooded conditions,
police have too much to do than to fool with rabbit stealers,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Trial Opens For 33 Moslem Fundamentalists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defendants in white robes waited in cages in
a makeshift courtroom as the trial began Saturday for the 33 Moslem
fundamentalists accused of using terror to disrupt the government.
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 15 defendants, two
of whom remain at large, for allegedly trying to kill two former
government ministers and a magazine editor.
   They are seeking penalties for the others of up to life in
prison.
   The defendants pleaded innocent and said they were tortured and
abused by state security policemen and prosecutors during
questioning. The prosecution denied the allegations.
   The 15 facing possible death sentences are charged with forming
an illegal organization called ``Salvation from Hell'' with the
intent of destabilizing the government through assassinations and
other attacks.
   They are charged with the attempted murders last year of former
interior ministers Hassan Abu Basha on May 6 and el-Nabawi Ismail
on Aug. 13, and magazine editor Makram Mohammed Ahmed on June 4.
   Abu Basha was wounded seriously, Ahmed sustained a minor hand
wound and Ismail was not injured.
   All of the defendants are accused of illegally possessing
firearms, explosives and pamphlets that contained information
designed to incite anti-government violence.
   Security was strong outside the courtroom, with at least four
armored personnel carriers and scores of armed soldiers present.
The 4{-hour session before chief Judge Omar el-Oteify of the
Supreme State Security Court and two fellow judges dealt mainly
with procedural matters.
   The 31 defendants in custody sat or stood in three cages in the
courtroom, a renovated exhibition hall.
   White banners hanging on the cages' iron bars proclaimed ``The
Moslems Are Coming'' and ``Prison and Execution Won't Move Us Away
from Islam.'' The defendants chanted similar slogans.
   Attorney Abdel-Halim Mandour, speaking for the group of 47
defense lawyers, told the court that police fabricated evidence
against the defendants.
   ``There is no illegal organization. This is a fabrication from
the state security,'' Mandour said. ``It is an attempt by these
people to strike against Islam and religious men.''

<HEAD>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich to Sell Florida Marine Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A developer who is buying a marine
laboratory in the Florida Keys from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
says he plans to build a resort but also hopes to preserve the
research facility.
   Henk Mastenbroek, who has developed several time-share vacation
properties in the Keys, agreed to pay $700,000 for the 7{-acre Sea
World Marine Science and Conservation Center, the only operating
facility of its kind in the country. An official at the Florida
Institute of Oceanography said the marine laboratory was unique
because of its access to tropical waters.
   The lab is being sold by the book publishing company Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc., which has been under pressure to sell real
estate and other assets to repay creditors after fending off a
hostile takeover bid last year. The marine lab was used to collect
sharks and tropical fish for HBJ's Sea World theme parks.
   The company had agreed to sell the laboratory to the Florida
Institute of Oceanography, an arm of the state university system,
but the deal fell through when the HBJ realized there was no
guarantee that the Legislature would allocate money for the
purchase, said Jim Harris, senior vice president of HBJ Land Co.
   Mastenbroek agreed to pay the same price the state would have
paid. He said although he planned to build a resort on the site, he
hoped he could maintain the lab, built in 1978, The Orlando
Sentinel reported in Saturday's editions.
   An administrator at the Institute of Oceanography said she
doubted that the marine laboratory would remain intact.
   ``Our problem is they (the developers) keep saying they have to
make money out of it, which isn't too likely,'' Sandra Vargo, a
project coordinator at the institute. ``I've seen too many research
facilities and they're not money makers.''
   Three years ago, the institute contracted with HBJ to use the
marine center for its own research. About 400 community college and
university students visit the center every year for a week-long
course on marine biology.
   Currently, the Department of Natural Resources is growing 10,000
conchs there to determine whether they can be grown to reseed
depleted conch beds. State and university researchers also are
studying the lobster population to determine whether the creature
has been overfished and needs protection.
   Vargo said the only other sites under U.S. control where similar
research could be conducted were in Puerto Rico and St. Croix.

   A major storm dumped up to 23 inches of snow on the western
Great Plains and piled it in road-blocking drifts up to 12 feet
high Saturday. The same storm poured heavy rain from Oklahoma into
the Gulf states, forcing scores to evacuate and causing one death.
   Tornadoes caused scattered damage in Louisiana early Saturday
after hitting four towns in eastern Texas on Friday.
   ``We had wave after wave of thunderstorms move into this area
during the night,'' said Mike Koziara of the National Weather
Service in New Orleans. ``They raked it hour after hour after hour
after hour.''
   Snow and blowing snow continued to bedevil travelers in
southeastern Colorado, where wind gusted to 40 mph, and many roads
were closed in the Oklahoma Panhandle and western Kansas, where
12-foot snowdrifts were reported.
   ``We're snowed in _ we're out of electricity and can hardly
move,'' Pete Barnes, the mayor of Elkhart, Kan., said Saturday
morning. Power was restored before noon to the town in southwestern
Kansas, by a utility crew that came by helicopter.
   Louisiana was hit hard Saturday. In the New Orleans suburb of
Marrero, about 200 people had to leave their homes. A tornado
damaged 30 to 40 houses and 20 businesses in Slidell and
neighboring parts of St. Tammany Parish, where fallen trees left
many subdivisions without power into the afternoon.
   Only 10 to 20 houses were flooded in New Orleans itself, but
bags of trash left out for garbage pickup floated down St. Charles
Avenue while cars drove along the raised streetcar tracks in the
median.
   New Orleans and Gretna, on the west bank of the Mississippi,
both got 8 inches of rain in 12 hours, with more expected, the
weather service said.
   One woman drowned early Saturday in Marrero when she turned off
a flooded street and drove into a drainage canal, said Sgt. John
Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's office.
   Flood crests were forecast from Sunday into Wednesday along many
rivers in southern Louisiana.
   Water also flowed into dozens of homes Saturday in Mississippi,
officials reported. Civil defense director Wade Guice said 4.2
inches of rain fell on Harrison County from midnight to noon
Saturday, and that the flooding was not from streams but from water
standing on already saturated ground.
   Oklahoma had both floods and snow, from 23 inches of snow in the
Panhandle to 4 feet of water in streets in Skiatook, in the
northeastern part of the state.
   Skiatook fire officials said about 30 homes were evacuated and
more than 15 businesses were shut down after Bird Creek overflowed.
The water began to recede Saturday afternoon, said Fire Capt.
Lonnie Fisher.
   One Skiatook resident, Arthur Elam, 88, rejected pleas from
neighbors to move to higher ground because of his dog, Blackie.
   ``No one would want to let him in their house,'' Elam said,
adding that Blackie wouldn't like getting out in the water. ``This
water bothers me, but it don't bother me bad.''
   In the Oklahoma Panhandle, ``We're just now starting to open
some roads back up,'' said Rick Foreman, a communications officer
at the state Highway Patrol. He said all but two highways in
Cimarron and Texas counties were closed during the morning.
   In the west-central Kansas town of Syracuse, 105 travelers
stranded by highway closings spent the night in the high school
gymnasium after the town's motels filled up, said a police
dispatcher who wouldn't give her name.
   Those travelers left when roads were reopened Saturday morning.
But Interstate 70 from Goodland, Kan., to Limon, Colo., remained
closed by dusk Saturday, and the Kansas Highway Patrol shut down a
100-mile stretch of the interstate's west-bound lanes, from
Goodland to WaKeeny, Kan., after motels in Goodland filled to
capacity late Saturday afternoon.
   In the adjacent southeastern corner of Colorado, 20 inches of
snow had fallen at Walsh with 16 inches at Fowler. The weather
service said snowdrifts stood 4 to 5 feet high in the area.
   In nearby Clayton, N.M., where 8 to 10 inches of snow fell,
travelers resumed their journeys Saturday after spending the night
stranded in the town. About 140 people took shelter at the First
United Methodist Church when motels filled up, carloads of people
went to other churches and the National Guard Armory, and 65 stayed
at the Fire Department.
   In Albuquerque, up to 100,000 customers lost power for a time
Friday when up to a foot of heavy snow downed power lines.
   In Chandler, Kan., about seven families moved out of their homes
Friday night because of rising water.
   ``They're kind of used to it,'' said Lincoln County Civil
Defense Director Mike Clarkson. ``They just kind of put things up
high on the lower floors and move out for a few hours.''

   For the second time in as many
days, a freighter has broken anchor in rough seas and run aground
just off the beach, the Coast Guard reported Saturday.
   The 128-foot Honduran freighter Brac Express with five crew
members became mired 30 yards offshore Saturday at about 2:30 a.m.
EST, said Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz. He said the Coast Guard
was not certain of the cargo.
   On Friday, a 506-foot empty petroleum barge bobbed about 20
yards from the beach most of the day before it was towed off early

   Democratic presidential hopefuls Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson campaigned Saturday for momentum and Paul
Simon fought for survival in this week's Wisconsin primary, as the
state reclaimed its historic role as a decisive crossroad on the
long nomination trail.
   Dukakis and Jackson are locked in a close Wisconsin contest
whose outcome could label one the front-runner in the 1988 race.
   Both men were in Wisconsin and Colorado on Saturday, preparing
for Colorado's precinct caucuses Monday that will set the stage for
the Wisconsin balloting Tuesday.
   Dukakis, delivering a major foreign policy speech Saturday at
the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, offered strong support for
Israel while blaming Arab leaders for the failure to achieve peace
in the Middle East.
   At a news conference later, Dukakis said he disagreed with
Jackson's embrace of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and his position that
Israel and the Palestinians are moral equivalents.
   Jackson, who was campaigning near Greeley, Colo., kept his
attack on the Reagan administration, which he said has ``the most
indictments, the most corruption, the highest sleaze factor in the
history of American government. we deserve better government _ we
deserve honorable leaders.''
   In Wisconsin, both candidates have laid down a clear appeal to
the blue-collar workers who are critical to Democratic success in
the state.
   ``I have argued your case. I've stood with you and with the
working people of America,'' Jackson told a crowd at St. Norbert
College near Green Bay late Friday. ``And now I want you to stand
with me.''
   Dukakis turned his fire on the coporations.
   ``If we're serious about winning the battle for our economic
future, we've got to get control of the merger and acquisition
binge that's ... leaving the average working men and women of
America holding the bag,'' he said in Racine.
   The two other Democrats _ Sens. Simon of Illinois and Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee _ ignored Colorado in favor of Wisconsin.
   The latest poll, published Sunday in the Milwaukee Journal,
showed Dukakis with a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over Jackson
among voters who said they would vote for, or leaned toward, a
Democratic candidate. Gore received 15 percent and Simon was fourth
with 5 percent. The poll, conducted last Wednesday and Thursday
among 845 likely voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
   ``This is the most important primary vote we have had since 1960
because of the closeness of the race.'' said Suellen Albrecht,
chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democrats. ``This is our moment in the
sun.''
   Simon put the rest of his chips on Wisconsin, playing for an
upset that would keep his hopes alive. The polls suggested his
effort could end next week.
   ``Not since 1960 has Wisconsin had a chance to say in such
concrete terms: We want a basic change,'' Simon told a crowd in
Madison last week.
   In 1960, then-Sen. John Kennedy upset Sen. Hubert Humphrey in
the Wisconsin primary and took a big step toward the White House.
   Gore is making a major effort in the state with hard campaigning
and a big investment in television ads. A surpising showing in
Wisconsin could be a big boost for what Gore has set as his pivotal
contest two weeks hence, in the New York primary.
   The Republican primary in Wisconsin is drawing little attention
since Sen. Bob Dole dropped his bid last week, leaving the
nomination wrapped up for Vice President George Bush. There are 47
GOP delegates at stake.
   The lack of a Republican race adds uncertainty for the
Democrats, since the Wisconsin open primary law allows GOP faithful
to vote in the still-disputed Democratic race.
   ``I'd welcome any Republican into the Democratic Party who wants
to vote for any candidate we have, if the vote is given
sincerely,'' Ms. Albrecht said. ``This is the very nightmare that
we had with the national party four years ago,''
   While academic experts say crossover voters have never made the
difference between winning and losing, Democrats were upset when
Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson said last week he would vote for
Jackson if he were a Democrat. Thompson later said he was not
trying to encourage crossover voting.
   In the delegate race, Dukakis held a narrow margin _ 653.55 to
646.55 for Jackson. Gore held 381.8 votes and Simon 169.5. A total
of 468.6 votes are uncommitted. At the July convention, 2,082 votes
are needed to win the nomination.
   Jackson got a three-delegate boost Saturday wehn he swept the
party caucuses in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Party vice chairman St.
Claire Williams said Jackson got 634 votes while Dukakis trailed
with only 37 votes. They were the only two candidates on the caucus
ballot.
   Six people, who each will cast one-half vote as delegates to the
Democratic National Convention, were chosen in Saturday's caucuses
in the U.S. territory.
   The Wisconsin primary offers 88 Democratic delegates, but that
is not the big prize. The winner in Wisconsin has the chance to
start momentum for a five-week stretch of big-state primaries that
could decide the nomination.
   Dukakis is looking for a big-state win to get his campaign back
on track after Jackson derailed it with a win on March 26 in the
Michigan precinct caucuses.
   The Massachusetts governor has started to retool his campaign
style, unveiling a new speech in Milwaukee Thursday night. Dukakis,
sometimes called a cold technocrat, admitted that he will never be
the ``Great Communicator'' in the mold of Ronald Reagan, but what
he called a ``Great Builder.''
   Jackson is looking to keep on winning, particularly in a state
where his base _ black Democrats _ is so small. Less than 4 percent
of the state's population is black.
   But Jackson has made a major effort to reach out to blue-collar
workers and farmers _ and has drawn dramatically large and
enthusiastic crowds in that effort.
   ``He's one of us, not a Washington big-wig,'' said Dave Dittman
from St. Croix County as he attended a big farm rally for Jackson
in the northern dairy country.
   A poll published in this week's editions of U.S. News & World
Report said that if Jackson became Dukakis' vice presidential
running mate, the Democrats could defeat the GOP ticket, regardless
of who became Bush's running mate. A Dukakis-Jackson ticket was
supported by 47 percent of the 1,004 people contacted last week by
telephone for the poll, while a hypothetical GOP ticket of Bush and
Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson would win 42 percent.
   The poll, conducted by the Roper Organization, has a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Pope, Worshipers Celebrate Christianity's Holiest Day</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details from vigil. Should stand for

<TEXT>
   Flickering lights from thousands of candles
illuminated St. Peter's Basilica late Saturday as Pope John Paul II
followed a procession of cardinals and bishops in ceremonies to
usher in Easter.
   A two-hour vigil on the eve of Christianity's holiest day of the
year culminated with a midnight Mass celebrating the resurrection
of Jesus Christ.
   Thousands of people packed into the pews and aisles lit small
candles as the silent procession moved through the cavernous church.
   The pope carried a long white candle as he walked to the main
altar under the ``Baldacchino,'' the baroque canopy designed by the
17th century sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The
pontiff's candle was lit from a large Easter candle in an act that
symbolizes the light of Christ.
   The ``Lumen Christi,'' or Light of Christ, was chanted three
times as the pope reached the main altar. After the third time, the
lights of the Basilica suddenly came on.
   ``During this night of vigil we are baptized in the death of
Christ. We are buried together with him in death, so that we may
walk in a new life, like Christ,'' John Paul said in his homily
delivered in Italian.
   After the homily, John Paul baptized and confirmed 27 people
from 11 countries. They youngest was a 7-year-old boy from India,
Asmathy Cristofanilli, and the oldest was Joana Maria Evora, 49,
from Cape Verde.
   The only American in the group was Sean Lamb, 19, a baskeball
player at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   ``Via you I send my greeting to your respective countries:
Korea, Germany, Japan, India, Indonesia, Cape Verde, Italy, Peru,
The United States of America, Hungary and Vietnam,'' the pope told
them.
   ``Coming from different parts of the world you symbolize the
universality of the church, the universality of redemption.''
   In his homily, the pontiff said ``this night of vigil invites us
to the greatest joy, the joy of the Easter of Christ.''
   On Sunday, during an open-air mass, the pope will give the
traditional ``Urbi and Orbi'' greetings to the pilgrims in St.
Peter's Square and television viewers around the world.
   That Mass caps a week of Easter activities. On Friday evening,
the pope carried a simple black wooden cross in a torchlit
procession at the Colosseum. Tens of thousands watched the ``Via
Crucis'' or way-of-the-cross, as the pope stopped at the 14
stations that symbolize Christ's agonizing walk to his crucifixion.
   On Thursday at the Basilica of St. John the Lateran, the pontiff
washed the feet of 12 priests in a service recalling Christ's last
supper with the apostles.
   Earlier Saturday, workers prepared for the outdoor Mass by
adorning the stairs to St. Peter's with thousands of flowers of a
multitude of colors. They hung ruby-colored draperies from the
columns around the entry to the Basilica and from the papal balcony.
   Hundreds of chairs were placed near the stairs and workers
installed loudspeakers so the huge crowd expected Sunday can hear
the pope.

<HEAD>Stress-Test On Shuttle Booster Apparent Success, NASA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stress test showed the space shuttle's
redesigned solid rocket boosters apparently can withstand the
weight of the orbiter, launch pressures and then some, a NASA
spokesman said Saturday.
   The structural load test was another step in certifying the
space shuttle for flight, said Ed Medal, a spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration at its Marshall Space
Flight Center.
   Hydraulic systems were used to apply pressures to a shortened
solid rocket booster. The test section was subjected to forces
equaling 150 percent of those normally experienced during launch,
he said.
   The booster rocket was not fired.
   ``Detailed analysis of the load condition will be conducted ...
over the next several weeks, but it appears the test was
successsful in demonstrating the capability required with reserve
for returning the shuttle to flight status,'' said Medal.
   He said the test booster, with included a flared aft skirt like
the two that support the shuttle's weight on the launch pad, failed
at the predicted weld when subjected to excessive pressures during
the Friday night procedure.
   ``This test demonstrated a capability greater than that tested
prior to the first shuttle launch,'' said Medal.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of Challenger in which seven people died. Investigators
blamed the disaster on a failed solid rocket booster joint that
allowed flames to burn into the vehicle's huge external fuel tank.
   NASA hopes to resume shuttle flights this summer.

   The Mormon Church on Saturday reported a
record increase in converts during 1987, and leaders warned members
against ostracizing non-Mormons in the church's Utah stronghold.
   Leaders also announced the appointment of two new members of the
leadership hierarchy and named a new president to the church's
organization for children.
   Mormon missionaries baptized 227,284 new members last year,
compared to 216,210 in 1986, according to the annual statistical
report of the 6.5-million-member church.
   The membership report was delivered on the opening day of the
158th Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
   The two-day conference has drawn thousands of Mormons from
around the world to hear sermons from the church's hierarchy,
including President Ezra Taft Benson, 88, who is considered a
prophet.
   Robert E. Sackley, 65, Bow Island, Canada, and L. Lionel
Kendrick, 56, Greenville, N.C., were named new members of the
Seventy, full-time clergy who assist the governing First Presidency
in directing the church. Sackley is currently president of the
church's mission in Nigeria, while Kendrick is directing missionary
efforts in the Tampa, Fla., area.
   Michaelene Packer Grassli was named president of the children's
program Primary. She succeeds Dwan J. Young, who is leaving the
position to accompany her husband, who has been appinted president
of the Calgary, Canada, Mission.
   The church's success in proselytizing has been accompanied by a
sharp increase in its missionary force, which has grown to 34,750
men and women, compared to 31,803 during 1986.
   ``Outside the church, many watch in amazement at this consistent
expansion, in spite of popular secularism,'' said David B. Haight
of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The Twelve are full-time
clergy who assist the three-member First Presidency in directing
the church. The Seventy follow the Twelve in the hierarchy.
   But while leaders celebrated the growth, they warned members to
avoid religious arrogance, particularly in Utah, where non-members
often complain that they are excluded from politics and social life.
   About two-thirds of Utah's 1.6 million people are Mormon, and
church members hold nearly all major political offices. The
governor and the congressional delegation are members. More than 80
percent of the Legislature is Mormon, including the Senate
president, House speaker, and the majority leaders in both chambers.
   Numerical superiority does not justify disdain for those who are
not Mormon, said Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Twelve and former
Utah Supreme Court justice.
   He said he recently received a letter in which the writer
complained that newcomers who are not Mormon arrive in Utah to find
themselves ``excluded at best and ostracized at worst.''
   That sentiment was demonstrated last week when Sacramento,
Calif., developer John Roberts turned down a job as chief of the
privately run Utah Economic Development Corp., saying the state has
an image of being inhospitable to non-Mormons. ``I was asked what
my religion was more in one afternoon in Salt Lake City than I have
in my entire life,'' Roberts said.

   J.D. ``Dull'' Stewart,
self-proclaimed leader of International Dull Folks Unlimited,
crashed the seventh annual National Humor Conference Saturday to
panhandle for his mythical presidential candidacy.
   Stewart, a statistical analyst from Rochester, N.Y., became the
champion of dullards everywhere with the creation of DENSA, an
organization whose name stands for nothing except as a send-up of
the high-IQ society, Mensa.
   Talking to a roomful of professors gathered at Purdue University
for a serious study of humor in American society, Stewart made his
money pitch: ``I said I'm in room 228 in the Union Club. You can
just leave your $250 checks ouside the door. I haven't seen any
yet.''
   Stewart is actually a registered participant and welcome, said
Don Nilsen, an Arizona State University professor.
   Stewart's kind of self-deprecating humor won a nod of
appreciation from the professors. ``It's funny because it's a
reversal,'' said Nilsen. ``It's an opposite of expectations.
Whatever our frustrations are, we have ways of dealing with those
frustrations by using this kind of humor.''
   It's more sophisticated than one-liner humor that commonly
targets ethnic groups, politicians or sex, he said.
   ``It's a coping device,'' he said. ``You have to develop coping
devices for the real problems of the world.''
   Another researcher, Rhoda Lee Fisher of the State University of
New York, said Stewart's style has lot in common with many
successful professional comedians. Despite success and the
admiration of the audience, genuine self-doubt remains, she
explained.
   ``In fact, most comedians come across as being down and up at
the same time,'' she said. ``They tell us they're silly, but we
secretly know they are special and brave and doing something most
of us would not have the fortitude to attempt.''
   The four-day humor conference, attended by about 70 professors
from a variety of disciplines, runs through Monday. Studies will be
presented on humor and business management, the humor of
intentional mispronunciation, and a paper titled, ``The Continuing
Saga of Arizona's Governor: A Humorous Sequel.''

<HEAD>9-Year-Old Lands After Transcontinental Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old California boy landed his
father's twin-engine plane in this Boston suburb Saturday, becoming
the youngest pilot to complete a transcontinental journey.
   Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano touched down at 5:45 p.m.
at Hanscom Air Field to break the record set last August by
10-year-old Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, Calif., officials
said.
   ``I like to fly so I wanted to break it,'' the 4-foot-8 pilot
said after he was greeted by his parents and friends, who gave him
a trophy, an aviator's scarf and a glass of champagne.
   National Aeronautics Association observer Don Taylor, who
accompanied Tony, verified that the boy was at the controls
throughout the transcontinental flight.
   ``I'm going to call Washington on Monday and tell them it's a
go,'' Taylor said.
   Christopher flew a plane from San Luis Obispo County, Calif., to
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Burbank, Calif., the longest trip by the
youngest pilot. If Tony succeeds in his plan to fly back to
Calfornia this week taking the long way home he says he will beat
the distance record, too.
   Tony, who is known as ``Buzz,'' completed the longest leg of his
four-day trip Saturday after taking off from Memphis. He had to
land twice _ in Bristol, Tenn., and Cambdridge, Md. _ because of a
stomach ache and was two and a half hours late in arriving. He
spent five hours in the air Saturday.
   When his father, Gary, asked why he didn't stay on the ground if
he felt sick, Tony replied: ``I wanted to make it here.''
   ``I'm very proud of him,'' said his father, who is from Palmer.
   The trip began Wednesday when Tony took off in his father's
twin-engine Cessna from John Wayne Airport in Costa Mesa, Calif. He
plans to return to California next Saturday, spending four to seven
hours aloft each day except Easter Sunday, when he visits relatives
in Palmer.
   With him in the cockpit were Taylor and his flight instructor,
Ed Fernett.
   Tony, who uses a booster seat to see over the control panel, is
to fly to Washington on Monday to receive an award from the
National Aeronautics Association for being the world's youngest
pilot.

<HEAD>London paper claims Israel and China in a secret arms deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sunday Times of London said there is a secret
Israeli operation under way to sell advanced missile technology to
China.
   It said Israel sent a five-man team of military specialists to
China in November and a deal was made to supply the Chinese armed
forces with missile warheads and armor-piercing devices developed
by Israel.
   The newspaper identified one of the men it said traveled to
China but did not give further attribution.
   It said there are indications Israel has been helping China
develop its own multipurpose combat fighter plane using technology
derived from the canceled Israeli Lavi fighter. The United States
had helped finance development of the Lavi, and the program was
dropped after Washington complained about delays and rising costs.
   ``Western intelligence agencies have suspected for some time
that there is a link between Israeli expertise and the speed China
has shown in developing advanced weaponry,'' The Sunday Times said.
   According to the newspaper, the arms deal was supervised by
Reuven Merhav, who it said is Israel's consul general in Hong Kong
and formerly worked for Mossad, Israel's secret service.
   Israel and China do not have diplomatic relations.
   The Sunday Times said five men flew to the Chinese capital of
Beijing using passports from the Philippines. It identified one of
the men as Israel Radomsky and said he was program manager of the
state-owned Israel Military Industries _ IMI. Radomsky
``reluctantly admitted that he and his team traveled to China,''
the report said, adding:
   ``He also said that, far from being a rogue operation, the
covert mission to China had been cleared at the highest levels of
the Israel government.''
   The newspaper said the other four members of the delegation were
all experts in IMI's missile division.
   Lawmaker Anthony Beaumont-Dark of the governing Conservative
Party said Saturday night that Britain should freeze all technology
and information exchanges with Israel until it explains the deal
with China.
   He said Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe should tell Israel
the arrangement is ``totally unacceptable.''
   ``We cannot go on sharing things with people who want to sell it
to a potential adversary for mercenary reasons, or with people we
cannot trust,'' Beaumont-Dark said.
   The Sunday Times said Israel officially denies arms ties with
China, but ``Jane's Defense Weekly, the authoritative military
affairs magazine, estimates the trade is already worth as much as
three billion dollars.''
   It claimed China wanted to keep its military links with Israel
secret ``for fear of harming its position in the Middle East.''
   Israel sought secrecy because a missile deal with China would
antagonize the United States, which has expressed concern about
China's sale of silkworm missiles to Iran, according to The Sunday
Times.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson condemned the
Reagan administration Saturday for corruption and economic
suffering, telling striking meat workers, ``Reagan is on the way
out and we're on the way in.''
   Jackson began two days of campaigning among Colorado Democrats
who hold caucuses Monday night to apportion 45 delegates.
Wisconsin's important primary follows on Tuesday.
   Jackson didn't refer to his Democratic rivals, except for
ex-candidate Gary Hart, the former Colorado senator. ``Since my
friend Gary is out, I am Colorado's favorite son,'' he said.
   Jackson spoke to about 1,000 workers outside the Monfort Portion
Foods meatpacking plant, where workers have been on strike for
higher wages since Nov. 16.
   Jackson said there have been ``seven years of midnight'' under
President Reagan and Vice President George Bush. He referred to the
Easter season in encouraging strikers to continue to have hope.
   ``Innocent people do suffer _ that's one of the lessons of
Easter,'' the black preacher and civil rights activist told the
mostly white audience.
   ``But just because you're suffering, don't surrender,'' he said.
``In the end, faith will not disappoint. ...
   ``They could not stop the government from killing Jesus, but the
government could not stop new hope, could not stop resurrection,
could not stop renewal,'' he said. ``We cannot stop Reaganomics,
but Reaganomics cannot stop us. ... Reagan is on the way out and
we're on the way in _ we, the people, are on the way in.''
   Jackson, who with his Democratic rivals has called for the
resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III, blasted the Reagan
administration for what he said was corruption and contempt.
   ``The Iran-Contra scam expresses contempt for the law. We must
have a president who knows and respects the law, a president who
sets the moral tone for our nation,'' he said. ``We have in this
administration the most indictments, the most corruption, the
highest sleaze factor in the history of American government. We
deserve better government. We deserve honorable leaders.''
   Jackson received an enthusiastic response from about 2,000
people _ mainly white and Hispanic _ who gathered later at an
outdoor rally in Pueblo. He then headed to the mountain resort of
Aspen _ which had 1{ feet of snow last week _ where he was
attending a fund-raising event and speaking to a group of local
residents and skiers.
   Jackson's campaign said it had had its best success ever in
raising money during the past month.
   Campaign spokeswoman Denise Lee said the campaign raised $2.1
million during March, including $500,000 in the week since
Jackson's stunning victory in Michigan's caucuses. She said that
since Super Tuesday, the amount of money received by the campaign
by mail has increased from about $20,000 a day to $60,000 a day.
   Jackson planned to attend Easter services in Denver on Sunday
morning.
   In Greeley, Jackson repeated his common themes of attacking
corporations for exporting jobs and exploiting cheaper foreign
labor. He led the crowd in chanting that they would vote for
Jackson at caucuses around the state Monday night _ meetings called
``get togethers'' rather than by their formal name, which he said
was intimidating to average voters.
   He noted that they fall on April 4, the 20th anniversary of the
assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tenn., where
Jackson was present as a young aide to the civil rights leader.
   Answering questions after his speech, Jackson called efforts to
require only English to be taught as the main language in schools a
``mean-spirited mistake.''

   President Alan Garcia on Saturday extended a
state of emergency in an important mining region where leftist
guerrillas have repeatedly attacked mines and railroads.
   A decree in the official gazette, El Peruano, said the emergency
measures would be extended for another two months across the
mountainous eastern half of Pasco state. Cerro de Pasco, the state
capital, is 120 miles northeast of Lima.
   Pasco is the center of Peru's vital mining industry that
provides more than 50 percent of the nation's foreign exchange.
Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have made hundreds of attacks in the
zone in an effort to cripple Peru's economy.
   The government began decreeing states of emergency in November
1980 because of the insurgency. Parts of seven states, including
Lima, currently are under states of emergency.
   A state of emergency suspends citizens' rights to travel and
assemble freely and permits government forces to conduct searches
without warrants and hold suspects for lengthy periods without
filing charges.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have been killed in
violence related to the Shining Path's eight-year-old campaign to
gain power.

   A 9-year-old girl whose lower legs were amputated
after she was found abandoned and freezing has a new foster family
and should be leaving the hospital before long, officials say.
   Darlwin Carlisle, of Gary, Ind., has been learning to walk on
artificial legs at La Rabida Children's Hospital.
   The foster parents ``are known to Darlwin and will begin
discharge training next week,'' said hospital spokeswoman Kris
Bangert.
   The girl has been at La Rabida since the end of January after
her frostbitten legs were amputated below the knee. She had been
abandoned in an empty, unheated house in Gary, and was found Jan.
17. Gangrene brought on the need for the amputations, doctors say.
   Her mother, Darlwin Britt, 24, was charged with felony child
neglect.
   The girl's foster parents were appointed by the Child and
Protective Services of Indiana. Their identities were not released.
   The ``hospital has been her family since the end of January,''
said Ms. Bangert.
   ``But it's still a hospital, not a real home,'' she said.
   Darlwin has made steady progress in her recovery, the
spokeswoman said.
   ``She walks everywhere with no assistance,'' said Ms. Bangert.
``And she looks great when she walks, too _ not wobbly or halting.''

<TEXT>
   The party of former opposition leader
Joshua Nkomo voted Saturday to merge with the ruling party of Prime
Minister Robert Mugabe in a step to unite the nation's most
powerful political movements.
   Nkomo, president of the Zimbabwe African People's Union, opened
the party's one-day congress with a plea to more than 5,000
delegates to endorse a unity accord he signed with Mugabe on Dec.
23.
   Nkomo said, ``This accord opens up broad vistas for the economy
of the country through the participation of all the people in
development.''
   Nkomo, 70, needed a simple majority vote to endorse the merger
but the congress passed two resolutions by unanimous vote. The
resolutions approved the merger and asked Nkomo and Mugabe to
proceed with uniting their parties' structures under one banner,
effectively dismantling Nkomo's party.
   ``This country will owe a lot to your decisions,'' Nkomo said
after the vote. ``We have a collective vision. We must stand
together. We must not deceive each other.''
   Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union is to vote on the unity
accord on April 9.
   Mugabe and Nkomo originally were allies in the campaign to bring
majority black rule to the country that was the white-ruled British
colony of Rhodesia.
   In 1963, Mugabe and some other officials left Nkomo's party to
form their own leftist movement.
   Both parties were outlawed by then-Prime Minister Ian Smith's
white-dominated government in 1964. Nkomo and Mugabe, along with
hundreds of other black nationalists, were detained for more than a
decade.
   Mugabe and Nkomo then became leaders in a seven-year guerrilla
war that ended when the country became independent on April 18,
1980. The alliance Mugabe and Nkomo had formed during the war came
apart after Mugabe's party won Zimbabwe's first election after
independence.
   Nkomo and Mugabe remained political foes until Dec. 23, when
they signed the unity accord that signaled an end to frequent
fighting between their supporters. In January Nkomo was appointed
one of three senior Cabinet ministers in a government shuffle.
   If both parties approve the merger, Mugabe, 64, will have the
support of all but one legislator in the 100-seat National Assembly
and the 40-member Senate. He needs the vote of all 140 lawmakers to
change the constitution and establish a one-party socialist state
that he advocates.
   The dissident lawmaker is businessman Goodson Sithole, but
political observers say he could join Mugabe's party before a vote
is taken in Parliament later this year.
   In another development, a gang of men stabbed to death a white
Zimbabwean farmer at his home and beat his wife unconscious, police
reported Saturday.
   They said the body of Johannes Du Toit, 55, was found by the
family cook Friday in the farmhouse near the town of Karoi, 112
miles northwest of Harare.
   Police said they had not determined the motive, but neighbors
who spoke on condition of anonymity said Du Toit recently had
argued with some of his black employees.

<HEAD>Robertson Sees Role as Conservative `Rallying Point'</HEAD>

   Pat Robertson said Saturday he would stay in the
race for the Republican nomination for president primarily because,
``I want to be a rallying point for conservatives.''
   ``I am the only conservative in the race, because George Bush is
considered to be a moderate,'' Robertson told reporters as he
campaigned in Colorado before Monday's precinct caucuses.
   ``There couldn't be anything more deadly than to be taken off
the evening news and off the front page of the newspaper, and that
is what is going to happen as soon as George Bush has it locked
up,'' Robertson said.
   At a news conference before a rally at the Sheraton Denver Tech
Center on Saturday afternoon, Robertson was asked about his role at
the Republican National Convention in New Orleans in August.
   ``I want to address the issues _ how we stand on taxes and
following the Reagan agenda,'' the former television evangelist
said, adding he believes the 1984 Republican platform should be
retained.
   ``I like the '84 GOP platform very much,'' he said, defining it
as a conservative position on strong defense, conservative judges,
fighting communism, lowering taxes ``and being less intrusive in
the lives of people.''
   The rally audience _ estimated by police at 400 people _
received information sheets placed on each seat that instructed
them in ways to be important factors Monday night at Colorado's
precinct caucuses, the starting point for sending 36 delegates to
the New Orleans convention.
   ``Keep your preference under wraps _ unknown!'' the sheet told
the audience members, adding that they should ``be polite'' but
should try to find out who people are supporting for president
``carefully.''
   Robertson's speech at the rally emphasized the importance of the
family, the need for winning the war against drugs and AIDS and
bringing God back into public school classrooms.
   He told the audience: ``I am going to be the champion of the
Christian and conservative points of view ... if it takes until
1992 to do it.''
   Robertson planned to give an Easter Sunday sermon to an
estimated 5,000 people in four congregations in the Denver area.
   Campaign aides said they had up to 10 phone bank operators
trying to persuade at least 10,000 people to show up for caucuses
Monday night. ``Our goal would be to have 15,000,'' said David
Nelson, a Denver businessman who is coordinating Robertson's
Colorado campaign.

<NOTE>EDS: Adds two grafs at bottom to UPDATE with funeral arrangements

<TEXT>
   Vernon W. Thomson, a former Wisconsin
governor, member of Congress for 14 years and Federal Election
Commission chairman, died Saturday at George Washington University
Hospital, a spokeswoman said. He was 82.
   Yvonne Hiott, the hospital spokeswoman, said the cause of death
was respiratory arrest. She said Thomson, who lived in the
Washington suburb of McLean, Va., had been in the hospital since
March 25.
   Thomson, a Republican member of the Wisconsin state assembly
between 1935-51 and speaker for three consecutive terms, served as
Wisconsin's governor in 1956 and 1957. He was elected to the U.S.
House of Representatives in November 1960, and served through 1974.
   After leaving Congress, he joined the FEC and remained there
until 1979, serving in 1976-77 as its chairman.
   In 1981, then-President Jimmy Carter called Thomson out of
retirement to serve a year as interim member of the commission.
   Carter's request that he rejoin the FEC illustrated the
government's respect for Thomson, said former Rep. Glenn R. Davis,
R-Wis., who described Thomson as a friend ever since they served in
the Wisconsin legislature together in the 1940s.
   ``He served longer than he was supposed to,'' Davis said
Saturday. ``I think he was one of the most respected members who
ever served in the House.''
   Born in Richland Center, Wis., Thomson attended Carroll College
and the University of Wisconsin Law School before serving as
Richland County district attorney in the 1930s and as Richland
Center mayor.
   After serving in the state legislature, he was elected state
attorney general in 1950, 1952 and 1954 before being named governor
for two years. He lost a re-election bid to the statehouse.
   Davis said Thomson's re-election defeat in 1958 was the only
serious setback in his political career.
   ``Unfortunately, 1958 was a bad year for Republicans,'' Davis
said.
   Thomson is survived by three children _ Vernon Jr. of McLean,
Patricia Thomson of Fletcher, Va., and Susan Thomson Turner of
Vienna, Va. _ and two grandchildren. His wife, the former Helen A.
Davis, died in 1973.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Thursday at Pratt funeral
home in Richland Center. Burial will be at the Richland Center
Cemetery.

<HEAD>Robeson County Indians Write Letter To Soviet Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Robeson County Indians charged in
the armed takeover of a Lumberton newspaper said they have written
to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The letters will be delivered to Moscow by attorney William
Kunstler, who hopes to make Indian rights an issue at the May
summit between Gorbachev and President Reagan, said Eddie Hatcher
on Saturday.
   Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, both of Pembroke, are
charged with hostage-taking and the manufacture and possession of
illegal weapons in connection with the Feb. 1 siege of The
Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton.
   ``We raised several issues in our letters regarding the Reagan
administration and past administrations' treatment of native
Americans that has been brought about by lies and broken
treaties,'' Hatcher said in a telephone interview with the
Fayetteville Observer-Times. ``We are political prisoners, and we
raise the fact that there are many other political prisoners like
us.''
   Hatcher and Jacobs, both Tuscarora Indians, have said that
mistreatment of minorities in Robeson County led them to take over
the newspaper offices.
   They released their hostages eight hours after the siege began
following a commitment by Gov. Jim Martin to appoint a task force
to study the Indians' claims agains the Robeson County government
and law enforcement agencies.

   Greek bakers in Detroit worked overtime making Easter Bread, a
small Illinois town carried on a Russian woman's decorating
tradition, and pastors all over fretted Saturday that the start of
daylight-saving time would make parishioners tardy for services.
   In eastern Texas, where tornadoes ripped through East Mountain,
Mound City, Gladewater and Union Grove Friday night, hundreds of
people banded together and spent their Easter weekend cleaning up
debris.
   Pastor Dick Lindsey of East Mountain Baptist Church Pastor Dick
Lindsey said Sunday's service will focus on the storm that damaged
or destroyed 46 homes.
   ``Even though we've gone through difficulties and a loss of
property there still is hope, and that's what the resurrection is
all about _ a new life,'' Lindsey said Saturday.
   Many pastors shared a less serious worry on Easter Eve _ whether
congregants would remember to set their clocks an hour ahead before
going to bed.
   ``I know there's been concern,'' said Pastor William deHeyman of
Redeemer Lutheran Church in Philadelphia.
   It was a stuck drawbridge, not an unset clock, that delayed the
Easter Bunny from his appointed round Saturday morning in Grand
Haven, Mich. The local Jaycees held up their egg hunt until the
guest of honor could arrive.
   For Sunday's Easter egg hunt in Terre Haute, Ind., organizers
were plotting how to foil overzealous parents who cheat to help
their children win prizes. More than 1,000 children were expected
to participate in the event at Deming Park in one of Indiana's
biggest annual easter egg hunts.
   In the past adults have painted winning numbers on eggs, or
found the highly coveted gold and silver eggs and passed them off
to their kids, said Georgeo Schoffstall of the American Legion,
which sponsors the event.
   Sixty monitors will be on hand to keep parents from collecting
any of the nearly 2,000 hidden eggs. ``We could use a 150,''
Schoffstall said.
   For more than 50 years, passers-by in Bement, Ill., marveled at
the thousands of colored eggs, plastic rabbits and ducks, and
statues of geese and goslings that adorned Zenaida Drake's yard.
   Although Mrs. Drake died last fall at age 73, her spirit lives
on, thanks to some old-fashioned community spirit and Mrs. Drake's
husband, Bill, who donated the decorations to the Bement Community
Council.
   Some of the council members went to the Drake home on Friday,
and the Bement Girl Scout Troop pitched in to set out the same
decorations that the Russian woman had displayed for nearly half a
century, many of which she had made herself.
   ``She always told us that in the old country, they decorated for
Easter like we do for Christmas, so she brought the tradition with
her,'' said Gary Jennings, president of the council.
   A 60-year tradition in New Orleans of showing off live bunnies
before Easter may be dropped next year, says the florist who sets
up the elaborate display.
   The fenced-in display, in which dozens of adult and baby rabbits
hop around a lawn or snuggle in wooden boxes cut to resemble
buildings along St. Charles Ave., opens 10 days before Easter and
lasts until Easter Sunday.
   Arthur Scheinuk, owner of Scheinuk The Florist, says thousands
come to see and sometimes buy the rabbits, but the display has been
picketed by activists charging animal cruelty.
   ``It will be determined by the public. If they want us to have
the rabbits next year, we suggest that they write in to us,'' he
said Saturday.
   On Good Friday in Traverse City, Mich., members of a youth group
from Faith Reformed Church carried a 120-pound pine cross more than
two miles, traversing Wayne Hill to their church.
   The Rev. Ron Spence said although the youths may have been
embarrassed carrying the cross, Christ was embarrassed, too.
   ``It's like if you had to carry an electric chair through the
streets of your town,'' Spence said. ``Jesus died in the most
humiliating way.''
   Easter doesn't fall until April 10 for Greek Orthodox
Christians, but that hasn't delayed holiday preparations.
   At the Astoria Pastry Shop in Detroit's Greektown district,
bakers were busy all day Saturday making loaves of Easter bread, a
rich pastry with a red egg in it, symbolizing the blood of Christ.
   ``It's been crazy,'' said baker Dennis Oster. ``We can't get it
out fast enough.''
   Owner Tasso Teftsis said he opened the shop at 6 a.m. and
``there were people waiting in cars outside.'' He said he planned
to stay open until 2 a.m.
   ``They want six, eight, 10,'' he said. ``We're backed up too
much.''

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration so far
has rejected using military force to oust Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, a White House spokesman said Saturday.
   Marlin Fitzwater scoffed at reports of a clamoring within the
State Department for tougher measures to push Noriega out, saying
the Panamanian problem has presented a ``fertile ground for rich
imaginations.''
   Several news reports have said that Secretary of State George P.
Shultz urged in high-level White House meetings that the United
States attempt to kidnap Noriega, who is under indictment in this
country on drug-trafficking charges.
   The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that the
administration also considered establishing headquarters in the
former Canal Zone for Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle _
who has been in hiding since Noriega ousted him in February _ and
surrounding the area with U.S. military forces so Delvalle could
campaign more effectively for Noriega's removal.
   Fitzwater on Saturday sought to minimize reports indicating the
administration was weighing military or covert action moves to get
Noriega out of power.
   And Shultz, speaking with reporters in Rome Saturday as he
continued a Mideast peacemaking mission, sidestepped questions
about his advice to Reagan.
   ``We debate various possible options,'' Shultz said. ``But
basically, this is a question of a person who no longer is wanted
in his country. The position of the United States government is
that he should go. Everybody agrees about that. He's been
indicted.''
   Shultz steadfastly refused to get into a debate about he options
he has proposed, saying that ``I never comment on speculative news
articles.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported in Saturday's editions that
Shultz and Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams also had
urged the dispatch of about 3,000 U.S. military forces to Panama to
further undermine Noriega's grip on power.
   The State Department, it said, was displeased with the
Pentagon's decision to bolster the U.S. military presence in Panama
by sending about 1,300 troops, many of them military police
officers.
   But Fitzwater described the deployment of these forces,
beginning early this week, as simply ``a continuation'' of the U.S.
effort to strengthen security for Americans in the troubled Central
American country.
   ``There have been any number of offensive plans raised, but to
this point, they have been rejected,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said ``the United States' intentions in Panama is to
protect'' U.S. assets and the approximately 40,000 American
citizens living there.
   ``Clearly, the decisions at this point have been limited to
defensive (options),'' he said, ``reinforcing security in Panama.
We want to be sure we have enough troops to protect our 40,000
citizens there.''
   Deputy White House press secretary Leslye Arsht said ``the whole
range of diplomatic, political and military options have been
considered. The kinds of things being reported can be considered in
that category.''
   She said ``the only decision the president has made is to
enhance the security forces, as announced by the Pentagon.''
   Fitzwater declined to be drawn into a discussion of the reported
feud between Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci over
the options to be pursued in Panama.
   But the spokesman did say that the decision to send the
additional 1,300 troops to the county was made by Carlucci, with
Reagan's approval.
   Fitzwater had said Friday that Reagan would be kept abreast of
the Panamanian situation as he and his wife, Nancy, vacation this
week at their mountaintop ranch near here. National security
adviser Colin D. Powell accompanied Reagan to California, and is
staying at a hotel in Santa Barbara, along with several other
presidential aides.
   The United States so far has mainly applied economic sanctions
and diplomatic pressure to oust Noriega, but the administration's
moves have not succeeded.
   Late last week, the administration said it was considering a
plan to seek the withholding of tax payments owed to Panama by U.S.
corporations that do business there.

   The guns are silent for the time being in
Nicaragua and there is even a truce of sorts between Republicans
and Democrats on the contentious issue of aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   And as Nicaragua's leftist government and the U.S.-backed rebels
prepare to negotiate a settlement to end their six-year war, the
Reagan administration has remained uncharacteristically silent, no
longer using apocalyptic terms to discuss its perception of the
stakes involved.
   Along with its rhetoric, the administration is lowering its
expectations of its ability to influence events in the region. But
most officials believe the Sandinista government is going into the
peace talks in a commanding position because of Contra military
weakness.
   For now, almost everyone, from the Sandinista government to
administration and congressional hardliners, believes the peace
process should be allowed to go forward without guns ablaze.
   Just a few weeks ago, bipartisanship on the Contra aid issue
seemed beyond reach. An administration aid proposal was defeated
narrowly in the House on Feb. 3 and a substitute Democratic plan
also was rejected by a slim margin a few weeks later.
   But this past week, both houses of Congress overwhelmingly
approved a $48 million package providing humanitarian aid for the
Contras as well as for children on both sides who have been injured
in the conflict. The package includes $10 million for independent
verification of the cease-fire agreement.
   Following Contra acquiescence to a 60-day cease-fire on March
23, both Republicans and Democrats agreed that this type of aid
package was the only option available to them. But the legislation
also includes a promise by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, that
he will not block ``fair and orderly'' consideration of a new
military aid request if the peace talks collapse due to Sandinista
intransigence.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., noted that the aid bill did not
provide weapons for the rebels, as Contra supporters had hoped. And
it went too far for Contra opponents, who object to sending any aid.
   ``This package strikes a balance,'' Dodd said during an
unusually harmonious floor debate on the proposal last Thursday.
   Dodd said the sole purpose of the package is to support the
cease-fire agreement: ``If not for that agreement, we wouldn't be
doing this today.''
   The official administration line is that the temporary
cease-fire was a step forward, and it is now up to the disputants
to resolve their differences at the bargaining table when peace
talks begin.
   Those talks were scheduled to begin Wednesday, but the Contras
said Saturday they would delay the talks for one week to provide
more time for technical commissions of both sides to work out
details of the five zones inside Nicaragua where rebel forces are
to gather under the provisions of the cease-fire accord.
   But a government statement signed Saturday by Deputy Foreign
Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco stressed it was ``extremely important''
to comply with the cease-fire pact's timetable and stick by the
April 6 meeting date.
   The administration's low-key attitude was symbolized by
President Reagan's decision on Friday to sign the aid legislation
in his White House residence, forgoing the ceremonial fanfare that
attends some bill-signings.
   The administration has long contended that the Sandinistas will
be forced to democratize and demilitarize only through Contra
military pressure, or at least the threat of it.
   Just last February, Reagan said the Sandinista government ``will
be free to continue the consolidation of their totalitarian regime,
the military buildup inside Nicaragua and communist subversion of
their neighbors'' if military aid to the Contras stops.
   The administration has not renounced Reagan's grim prediction
but it appears that an informal moratorium has been placed on that
type of rhetoric.
   Things have been quiet in Nicaragua as well. A formal cease-fire
replaced the temporary one on Friday, and the Nicaraguan Defense
Ministry reported no violations.
   Many Nicaraguans marked the long Easter weekend by taking
vacations at beaches on the Pacific coast. Banks, government
offices, stores and most restaurants were closed until Monday.
   When talks on a permanent truce begin, the Contras are expected
to issue demands for 17 democratic reforms, abolition of the draft,
the repatriation Soviet bloc military advisers and other measures.
   In effect, they will be asking the Sandinistas to negotiate the
revolution, something the government has said it would never do.
The process is not expected to be free of friction.

   Police arrested 11 protesters who moved into
vacant apartments at a public housing project Saturday, but did not
arrest demonstrators who set up a nearby tent city, officials said.
   The 11 who were arrested at the Chicago Housing Authority's
Henry Horner Homes were charged with criminal trespass and released
on $100 bond apiece, said Officer Richard Touhy. He said police
were called to the buildings by housing authority security guards.
   The protesters were members of the Chicago-Gary Area Union of
the Homeless, and moved into the vacant apartments as part of a
two-pronged demonstration on behalf of the city's estimated 25,000
homeless.
   The other half of the demonstration involved setting up a dozen
tents on a vacant lot nearby.
   Union members vowed to stay in the tents for a week, saying they
wanted to call attention to the housing authority's refusal to
allow the homeless to stay in its vacant apartments.
   Several members of the union said they would try to move back
into the apartments where the 11 were arrested.
   Dolores Thomas, a secretary for the union, said this weekend was
chosen for the protest because April 1 is the date that half of the
city-run shelters and warming centers for the homeless were closed
this year. She estimated that about 500 people had to go back on
the streets because of the seasonal move.

<HEAD>Carter Administration Considered But Dropped Arms For Hostages
Swap in 1980</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Carter administration considered an
arms-for-hostages swap in 1980 but scuttled the plan because of
doubts about the Iranian go-between, newly declassified documents
show.
   President Carter considered offering $10 million in military
spare parts for 52 Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran, The Miami Herald reported in Sunday editions.
   However, the administration backed away from the plan after
deciding arms dealer Houshang Lavi did not have the backing of
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, then president of Iran, the newspaper
reported.
   Under the Reagan administration, the U.S. sold arms to Iran in
exchange for the release of some American hostages held in Lebanon.
Funds from the sale were diverted to Contra rebels at a time when
such aid was banned by Congress.
   The declassified documents, mostly Carter-era CIA and State
Department memos, provide the first detailed account of Carter
efforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980 election, which
Ronald Reagan won by a landslide.
   Lavi, an Iranian-born resident of New York's Long Island, became
involved with the Carter administration after first contacting the
campaign of independent presidential candidate John Anderson. The
documents gave no indication whether the Reagan campaign was
approached.
   The documents were turned over to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee, as
part of his investigation into whether Reagan's 1980 campaign made
a secret arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   One of the CIA memos, dated Oct. 3, 1980, mentioned a
conversation between an unidentified agency officer and Lavi in
which he offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a a
seven-page list of F-14 parts.
   Lavi ``wished to arrange the delivery to Iran of $8 (million) to
$10 million of F-14 spare parts,'' the memo said, adding he ``would
arrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spare
parts'' and U.S. agreement to unfreeze Iranian assets, forgive
claims against Iran and stay out of internal Iranian affairs.
   The CIA officer recommended against pursuing the offer.
   The memos indicate Carter officials ended contacts with Lavi on
Oct. 19, 1980, after a foreign ambassador in Tehran reported that
Bani-Sadr had not been aware of Lavi's offer.
   WLS-TV in Chicago reported Oct. 15, 1980, that arms-for-hostages
talks were under way, and a 1984 congressional investigation
concluded the leak came from a ``highly placed member of the U.S.

   Nicaraguan rebels on Saturday said
they would delay talks with the Sandinista government for one week,
but the government called on the Contras to stick to the original
timetable for discussing a lasting peace.
   The high-level talks between delegations from the government and
rebels, known as Contras, were scheduled to begin on Wednesday in
Managua.
   A rebel leader indicated the Contras wanted more time for
technical commissions of both sides to work out details of the five
zones inside Nicaragua where rebel forces are to gather under the
provisions of a 60-day cease-fire accord.
   Adolfo Calero, one of the top Contra leaders, said in a
telephone interview from Miami that the rebel delegation will not
meet with the Sandinistas until April 12.
   ``We feel it's not violating the accord,'' Calero said of the
postponement.
   A government statement Saturday signed by Deputy Foreign
Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco stressed it was ``extremely important''
to comply with the cease-fire pact's timetable and stick by the
April 6 meeting date.
   The statement said the government considered it
``counterproductive to postpone the April 6th high-level meeting.''
   Tinoco said the Contras showed ``a tendency to systematic lack
of compliance with the agreed-upon calendar'' of the accord.
   The agreement to meet Wednesday in Managua, which would be the
first talks between the two sides in the Nicaraguan capital, had
been reached in negotiations last month in the village of Sapoa
beside the border with Costa Rica.
   A Tinoco letter released Saturday night, which apparently had
been prepared before the Contras insisted on a postponement,
disclosed plans for the Wednesday meeting.
   It said arrangements had been made for the talks to be held in
Managua's Hotel Las Mercedes beginning at 4 p.m. ``as is stipulated
in the Sapoa accords.''
   The letter addressed to rebel leaders said Sandinista and Costa
Rican officials were to guarantee the Contra delegation's security.
It added the government would consider ``counterproductive any type
of political activity outside the framework and objective of the
Managua meeting.''
   U.S.-backed rebel and leftist govenment leaders signed an
agreement March 23 aimed at ending the more than six-year war. The
Sandinistas met the first parts of the plan by freeing 100
political prisoners, holding technical talks on the cease-fire and
formally enacting the 60-day cease-fire on Friday.
   But the two days of technical talks among military officers from
both sides failed to net desired results for the Contras. According
to the cease-fire agreement, the rebels are to move into zones
during the first 15 days of April while talks go on for the
duration of the 60-day cease-fire.
   The two sides agreed to five zones but failed to specify their
size or exact locations. Nor did they work out operating guidelines
while the rebels remained in the zones.
   The Sandinistas reportedly want the Contras to lay down their
arms, a move the rebels say they will not do.
   The delay was necessary because the technical commissions
``still are negotiating ... verification of the zones and the modus
operandi'' of Contra fighters inside the zones, Nicaraguan
Resistance spokesman Jorge Rosales said in an interview from Miami.
   Calero also charged the Sandinistas had violated the agreement
by not freeing the prisoners they had requested.
   ``They played tricks. They released only about 10 of those we
requested. The rest were (those) held for a few days,'' he said.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella group, also said
Saturday the government has refused to sell necessary printing
materials to the opposition La Prensa newspaper ``while it
continues granting all paper and other materials for publication to
the other newspapers,'' in violation of the pact's condition for
full press freedom in Nicaragua.
   Under the terms of the cease-fire pact, the Sandinistas said
they would release all 3,300 political prisoners gradually, the
last coming after the 60-day cease-fire period ended June 1. The
government also pledged full freedom of expression.
   The Contras pledged to accept only humanitarian aid through a
neutral organization. That clause, according to the Sandinistas,
means the rebels can receive only civilian clothes, food and
medicine and that it must come through an organization such as the
Red Cross.

   The Reagan administration, expressing concern
about the safety of Americans in Panama, has decided to dispatch
another 1,300 military personnel to the troubled Central American
nation.
   Among the units being ordered south is an Army aviation task
force that includes helicopter gunships.
   The Pentagon announced the decision to increase the number of
troops in Panama late Friday evening ``in view of the growing
unrest and tension'' in that country. The deployments are to begin
Tuesday and be completed by April 8.

   Soldiers were off the streets as
Easter weekend began and a jailed opposition leader's wife said her
husband was being held hostage in Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
effort to maintain power.
   Also Friday, the Pentagon said it was sending 1,300 more
military personnel to protect U.S. bases and thousands of American
residents, bringing to nearly 12,000 the number of U.S. troops in
Panama.
   Opposition leaders said they planned to meet today or Sunday to
decide whether to lift a 12-day-old general strike that has shut
down most commercial activity in an effort to oust Noriega,
Panama's de facto leader and heads of its 15,000-member Defense
Forces.

   With fewer Holy Week visitors than usual
because of the Arab uprising in its occupied lands, Israel sought
to ensure the safety of the thousands of Christians who had come
for Easter Sunday observances.
   Friday was stained by bloodshed as Christians commemorated Good
Friday, Jews began the start of the week-long Passover festival and
angry Moslems rioted as they left mosques after morning prayers.
   Police and troops were reinforced in and around Jerusalem's holy
sites to protect participants at Easter ceremonies by Christians
celebrating their belief that Christ was resurrected two days after
dying on a cross.

   Although the Roman Catholic Church has never
formally accepted the Shroud of Turin as Christ's burial cloth, it
has kept it wrapped in red silk inside a silver chest on the altar
of the cathedral of Turin _ on the chance that indeed it might be
genuine. Modern science may be on the verge of an answer.

   After centuries of debate, scientists in England,
the United States and Switzerland may finally determine whether the
Shroud of Turin is a medieval forgery or old enough to have existed
at the time of Christ's death on the cross.
   The Vatican, for the first time, is allowing radiocarbon-dating
of the mysterious linen, which appears to bear the image of a
crucified man and is venerated by some as Christ's burial cloth.
   A date from the Middle Ages will be compelling evidence of what
skeptics have argued all along _ that the Shroud of Turin is a fake.
   Although no one will ever prove the image is Christ's, a date
anywhere near 2,000 years old could cause a sensation, for it would
indicate the shroud existed when Christ was crucified.
   ``I would be rather awed if it looked extremely probable that it
was his burial cloth,'' said Oxford University's Dr. Robert Hedges,
one of the scientists carrying out the tests.
   The British Museum has agreed to guarantee the scientific
validity of the carbon-dating, which is to be done independently on
nuclear atom-counters at Oxford, the University of Arizona and the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at the University of Zurich.
   No timetable has been set, but Dr. Michael Tite, director of the
museum's research laboratory, said tests should begin this spring
and the results announced possibly by the summer.
   The triple carbon-dating should reveal the shroud's age within a
200-year range, he said.
   ``If you get a medieval date, then clearly it is not The
Shroud,'' Tite said in an interview.
   ``If you get a date of the period of Christ, then it doesn't
tell you anything _ except that it tells you it could be the
genuine thing.''
   The most extensive investigation was the 1978 Shroud of Turin
Research Project, in which dozens of scientists subjected the cloth
to chemical analysis and took 30,000 photographs of it.
   They concluded the stains were human blood and the image too
thin to be an artist's work.
   The shroud, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide,
bears a faint yellowish image of both the front and back of a man's
body. Stains, scientifically identified as blood, can be seen
around the wrists, forearms and head, corresponding to New
Testament descriptions of Christ's wounds from being whipped,
speared, nailed to a cross and crowned with thorns.
   Believers contend the image was left by a supernatural burst of
energy accompanying Christ's resurrection.
   Skeptics, however, maintain it was painted during the Middle
Ages, when the production of fake religious relics was commonplace.
   Historical records have authoritatively traced the shroud to
1354. References to the shroud before then are sketchy, and
scientists have long tried to persuade the Roman Catholic Church to
subject it to carbon-dating.
   The Vatican, which owns the shroud, previously argued that
carbon-dating would damage the cherished linen. But the development
of an atom-counter known as an accelerator mass spectrometer in the
1970s made it possible to date objects with much smaller samples.
   The old technique would have required a piece of the shroud the
size of a paper napkin. The spectrometer can use a sample no bigger
than a postage stamp. The Vatican refused to say when samples would
be cut from the shroud, which is locked away in the cathedral at
Turin, Italy. Scientists doing the tests have been barred from
witnessing the sample-taking procedure or saying when they received
their samples.
   Instead, the sample-cutting was being videotaped and
photographed for documentation. Tite and the archishop of Turin,
Cardinal Anastasio Alberto Ballestrero, were to witness the cutting
to certify the procedure.
   More controversially, the Vatican announced in January that it
would allow only three laboratories to take part in the tests,
instead of the seven originally planned.
   The decision outraged, among others, Dr. Robert Otlet, director
of one of the rejected labs, the British Atomic Energy Authority's
Isotope Measurements Laboratory at Harwell. The lab is a world
leader in dating archaeological finds.
   ``I think it's as much a catastrophe as it would be if you
allowed bulldozers to go over an archaeological site before you've
examined it,'' he said in an interview.

   Another test center rejected by the Archdiocese of Turin was the
Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the University of
Rochester in New York state, which developed the nuclear carbon
14-dating technique chosen for the tests.
   Professor Harry Gove, the lab director who spearheaded the
campaign to carbon-date the shroud, said in a telephone interview
that restricting the tests to three labs and thereby eliminating a
second carbon-dating technique would make the results ``a lot less
believable.''
   ``There are a lot of people who think the shroud is a phony, so
if the dating is a number that comes around 2,000 years, they're
going to say there's been some kind of conspiracy,'' he said.
   New Scientist, a British journal, accused the Vatican of
revising the testing protocol to produce an ambiguous result that
would allow people to continue believing in the shroud is a genuine
relic.
   Professor Luigi Gonella, scientific adviser to the Archdiocese
of Turin, said the church never claimed the shroud was authentic,
only that it might be and ``must be treated with respect and
caution.''
   The number of testing labs was restricted to minimize damage to
the shroud, Gonella said, adding that the archdiocese had never
agreed to allow more than three labs to participate.
   ``Critics talk about us reducing the number of labs from seven
to three, while we see it as increasing it from one to three,'' he
said in an interview.
   The British Museum's Tite said there is no reason to think that
three labs could not produce a sound result.
   ``It is in fact quite unusual to do two or three measurements on
a normal archaeological specimen,'' he said. ``One is the normal
number, two you're providing a check and three you're providing a
doublecheck.''
   Tite said each test lab will receive a 0.3-square-inch sample of
the shroud. They also will get two dummy cloth samples, one
carbon-dated and the other dated historically but not
scientifically, to see if they get consistent results for all three
samples.
   The labs are not supposed to know which sample is from the
shroud, but Tite acknowledged that the linen's distinctive
herringbone weave would probably give it away under the microscope.
   Hedges, head of the radiocarbon-dating unit at Oxford's Research
Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, said he would
not deliberately try to determine which of the three samples is
from the shroud.
   ``In a sense, it almost puts one under too much pressure,'' he
said in an interview. ``It's sort of more relaxed if one doesn't
really know.''
   Either way, he added, it wouldn't affect the findings.
   Hedges said carbon-dating would establish the time at which the
flax in the shroud was growing, rather than when the cloth was
made, although the two dates presumably are about the same.
   Asked how confident he was of establishing the shroud's age,
Hedges said: ``I wouldn't put my life on it. But on the other hand,
I'd make a pretty hefty bet.''

   The history of the Shroud of Turin goes back
only about 800 years, when a crusading knight said he saw it in
Constantinople. It never has been traced to the Holy Land.
   The Roman Catholic Church does not claim it is Jesus' burial
cloth, and many critics have dismissed the linen cloth and its
image as a clever forgery.
   Perhaps the shroud's earliest known debunker was Pierre d'Arcis,
bishop of Troyes. In a 1389 letter, he told Clement VII, the papal
claimant in Avignon, that the bishop who preceeded him in Troyes
knew who painted it.
   ``The church is aware there is a big historical gap and it is
also aware this historical gap will never be filled
satisfactorily,'' Professor Luigi Gonella, the scientific adviser
to the archbishop of Turin, said in a recent telephone interview.
   The shroud, bequeathed to the pope by ex-King Umberto II of
Italy upon his death in 1983, has been kept in the cathedral at
Turin since 1578.
   Through records, the shroud can be traced to Lirey in France in
1354. In 1453, the royal family of Savoy got the shroud and kept it
at the castle of Chambery, where fire damaged it in 1532.
   There are references to it as early as the 5th or 6th centuries,
and coincidences have been found between the shroud and 7th-century
Byzantine art and liturgy.
   Witnesses including William of Tyre in 1171 and Robert of Clari
of the fourth crusade in 1203 reported seeing the shroud in the
imperial palace at Constantinople. The trail then is lost until the
shroud appears in France.
   Gonella said the church doesn't recognize the shroud as a relic
but as a ``cherished object'' that must be given the respect due a
relic.
   ``The church understands it will never know if it is the actual
burial cloth of Jesus,'' said Gonella. ``But it has the probability
of being the burial cloth of Jesus and must be treated with respect
and caution.''
   Wrapped in red silk under protective glass and an iron grill,
the shroud is kept on an altar in a silver chest that has only
rarely been opened in the last century.
   Perhaps the most significant occasion was in 1898, when a man
named Secundo Pia was allowed to photograph it.
   The result was sensational.
   The image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative,
so the negative on Pia's photographic plate gave the world its
first positive image of the man on the shroud.
   Pia's work confounded skeptics: Why would a medieval forger
paint a negative image _ an image that produced a perfect positive
visible only centuries later when photography was invented?

   Here, briefly, is how carbon-dating works:
   All living things absorb carbon 14, a radioactive isotope
created by rays bombarding the Earth's atmosphere from outer space.
   There is a certain proportion of carbon 14 to nonradioactive
carbon 12 in the air and in living things. While plants and animals
are alive, this proportion remains the same. When they die, they
stop absorbing carbon 14.
   Because it is radioactive, carbon 14 decays at a known rate. It
takes 5,730 years for half the carbon 14 to decay.
   Carbon 12 does not decay. So by measuring the proportion of
carbon 14 to carbon 12 left in a sample, scientists can tell when
the plant or animal it came from died.
   To count carbon atoms, a sample must first be converted into
carbon dioxide. This is done by burning.
   A technique more advanced from original procedures used in the
1940s, when carbon-dating was first applied, uses a nuclear
atom-counting machine called an accelerator mass spectrometer.
   It propels carbon dioxide through a tube at tremendous speed,
causing the various atomic particles to separate and making it
possible to detect carbon 12 and carbon 14.
